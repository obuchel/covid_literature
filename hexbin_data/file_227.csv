697,697,697,Cochrane Systematic Reviews of Chinese Herbal Medicines: An Overview,19.20517,8.569049,2011-12-09,"OBJECTIVES: Our study had two objectives: a) to systematically identify all existing systematic reviews of Chinese herbal medicines (CHM) published in Cochrane Library; b) to assess the methodological quality of included reviews. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We performed a systematic search of the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR, Issue 5, 2010) to identify all reviews of CHM. A total of fifty-eight reviews were eligible for our study. Twenty-one of the included reviews had at least one Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) practitioner as its co-author. 7 reviews didn't include any primary study, the remaining reviews (n = 51) included a median of 9 studies and 936 participants. 50% of reviews were last assessed as up-to-date prior to 2008. The questions addressed by 39 reviews were broad in scope, in which 9 reviews combined studies with different herbal medicines. For OQAQ, the mean of overall quality score (item 10) was 5.05 (95% CI; 4.58-5.52). All reviews assessed the methodological quality of primary studies, 16% of included primary studies used adequate sequence generation and 7% used adequate allocation concealment. Of the 51 nonempty reviews, 23 reviews were reported as being inconclusive, while 27 concluded that there might be benefit of CHM, which was limited by the poor quality or inadequate quantity of included studies. 58 reviews reported searching a median of seven electronic databases, while 10 reviews did not search any Chinese database. CONCLUSIONS: Now CDSR has included large numbers of CHM reviews, our study identified some areas which could be improved, such as almost half of included reviews did not have the participation of TCM practitioners and were not up-to-date according to Cochrane criteria, some reviews pooled the results of different herbal medicines and ignored the searching of Chinese databases.","Hu, Jing; Zhang, Junhua; Zhao, Wei; Zhang, Yongling; Zhang, Li; Shang, Hongcai",PLoS One,227,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS: This diagnostic study was conducted from January 2014 until June 2015 in three major educational medical centers, Tehran, Iran. For patients selected with diagnosis of septic shock, peripheral blood sample was taken for testing the VBG parameters and the anion gap (AG) was calculated. All the mentioned parameters were measured again after infusion of 500 cc of normal saline 0.9% in about 1 h. RESULTS: Totally, 93 patients with septic shock were enrolled, 63 male and 30 female. The mean age was 72.53 ± 13.03 and the mean Shock Index (SI) before fluid therapy was 0.79 ± 0.30. AG and pH showed significant negative correlations with CVP, While HCO3 showed a significant positive correlation with CVP. These relations can be affected by the treatment modalities used in shock management such as fluid therapy, mechanical ventilation and vasopressor treatment. CONCLUSION: It is likely that there is a significant statistical correlation between VBG parameters and AG with CVP, but further research is needed before implementation of the results of this study.","Rahim-Taleghani, Sima; Fatemi, Alireza; Alavi Moghaddam, Mostafa; Shojaee, Majid; Abushouk, Abdelrahman Ibrahim; Forouzanfar, Mohammad Mehdi; Baratloo, Alireza",Turk J Emerg Med,227,22

Plasmodium merozoite surface protein 4 (MSP4) has been listed as a blood-stage subunit vaccine candidate for malaria. Infection with Plasmodium ovale species including P. ovale wallikeri and P. ovale curtisi, is also a source of malaria burden in tropical regions where it is sometimes mixed with other Plasmodium species. However, little is known about P. ovale MSP4. METHODS: The msp4 gene was amplified through polymerase chain reaction using genomic DNA extracted from blood samples of 46 patients infected with P. ovale spp. and amplified products were sequenced. Open reading frames predicted as immunogenic peptides consisting of 119 and 97 amino acids of P. ovale curtisi MSP4 (PocMSP4) and P. ovale wallikeri MSP4 (PowMSP4), respectively, were selected for protein expression. Recombinant proteins (rPoMSP4) were expressed in Escherichia coli, purified, analysed, and immunized in BALB/c mice. The specificity of anti-MSP4-immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies was evaluated by Western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and cellular immune responses were analysed via lymphocyte proliferation assays. RESULTS: Full peptide sequences of PocMSP4 and PowMSP4 were completely conserved in all clinical isolates, except in the epidermal growth factor-like domain at the carboxyl terminus where only one mutation was observed in one P. o. wallikeri isolate. Further, truncated PoMSP4 segments were successfully expressed and purified as ~ 32 kDa proteins. Importantly, high antibody responses with end-point titres ranging from 1:10,000 to 1:2,560,000 in all immunized mouse groups were observed, with high IgG avidity to PocMSP4 (80.5%) and PowMSP4 (92.3%). Furthermore, rPocMSP4 and rPowMSP4 cross-reacted with anti-PowMSP4-specific or anti-PocMSP4-specific antibodies. Additionally, anti-PoMSP4 IgG antibodies showed broad immuno-specificity in reacting against rPoMSP1 and rPoAMA1. Lastly, PocMSP4- and PowMSP4-immunized mice induced cellular immune responses with PocMSP4 (36%) and PowMSP4 cells (15.8%) during splenocyte proliferation assays. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study suggest conservation in PoMSP4 protein sequences and high immunogenicity was observed in rPoMSP4. Furthermore, induction of immune responses in PocMSP4- and PowMSP4-immunized mice informed that both humoral and cellular immune responses play crucial roles for PoMSP4 in protection.","Uwase, Juliette; Chu, Ruilin; Kassegne, Kokouvi; Lei, Yao; Shen, Feihu; Fu, Haitian; Sun, Yifan; Xuan, Yinghua; Cao, Jun; Cheng, Yang",Malar J,227,12

Small, non‐toxic and highly active, furin inhibitors are considered to be attractive drug candidates for diseases caused by virus and bacteria. In this study, a series of peptide inhibitors were designed and synthesized based on the C‐terminal fragment of histone H1.2, which has an inhibitory effect on furin. Replacing the reactive site of inhibitors with the consensus substrate recognition sequence of furin has been found to increase inhibitory activity greatly. The most potent inhibitor, I(4), with 14 amino acid residues has a K(i) value of 17 nM for furin. Although most of the synthesized peptides were temporary inhibitors, the inhibitor I(5), with nine amino acids, retained its full potency, even after a 3 h incubation period with furin at 37 °C. These inhibitors may potentially lead to the development of anti‐viral and antibacterial drug compounds.","Wang, Suming; Han, Jinbo; Wang, Yanfang; Lu, Wuyuan; Chi, Chengwu",Acta Biochim Biophys Sin (Shanghai),227,1

Advances in extracorporeal CO(2) removal (ECCO(2)R) technologies may facilitate more protective lung ventilation in acute respiratory distress syndrome, and enable earlier weaning and/or avoid invasive mechanical ventilation entirely in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations. We evaluated the in vitro CO(2) removal capacity of the novel PrismaLung+ ECCO(2)R device compared with two existing gas exchangers. METHODS: The in vitro CO(2) removal capacity of the PrismaLung+ (surface area 0.8 m(2), Baxter) was compared with the PrismaLung (surface area 0.35 m(2), Baxter) and A.L.ONE (surface area 1.35 m(2), Eurosets) devices, using a closed-loop bovine blood–perfused extracorporeal circuit. The efficacy of each device was measured at varying pCO(2) inlet (p(in)CO(2)) levels (45, 60, and 80 mmHg) and blood flow rates (Q(B)) of 200–450 mL/min; the PrismaLung+ and A.L.ONE devices were also tested at a Q(B) of 600 mL/min. The amount of CO(2) removed by each device was assessed by measurement of the CO(2) infused to maintain circuit equilibrium (CO(2) infusion method) and compared with measured CO(2) concentrations in the inlet and outlet of the CO(2) removal device (blood gas analysis method). RESULTS: The PrismaLung+ device performed similarly to the A.L.ONE device, with both devices demonstrating CO(2) removal rates ~ 50% greater than the PrismaLung device. CO(2) removal rates were 73 ± 4.0, 44 ± 2.5, and 72 ± 1.9 mL/min, for PrismaLung+, PrismaLung, and A.L.ONE, respectively, at Q(B) 300 mL/min and p(in)CO(2) 45 mmHg. A Bland–Altman plot demonstrated that the CO(2) infusion method was comparable to the blood gas analysis method for calculating CO(2) removal. The resistance to blood flow across the test device, as measured by pressure drop, varied as a function of blood flow rate, and was greatest for PrismaLung and lowest for the A.L.ONE device. CONCLUSIONS: The newly developed PrismaLung+ performed more effectively than PrismaLung, with performance of CO(2) removal comparable to A.L.ONE at the flow rates tested, despite the smaller membrane surface area of PrismaLung+ versus A.L.ONE. Clinical testing of PrismaLung+ is warranted to further characterize its performance.","Hospach, Ingeborg; Goldstein, Jacques; Harenski, Kai; Laffey, John G.; Pouchoulin, Dominique; Raible, Manuela; Votteler, Stefanie; Storr, Markus",Intensive Care Med Exp,227,1
11376,11376,11376,A pilot survey of ventilated cancer patients’ perspectives and recollections of early mobility in the intensive care unit,18.876732,8.567415,2019-05-29,"Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is commonly used to screen for pulmonary hypertension (PHTN) in neonates and young infants. However, in the absence of sufficient tricuspid regurgitation (TR), a ventricular septal defect (VSD), or a patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), the estimation of systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP) becomes challenging. Pulmonary artery acceleration time (PAAT) is an alternate parameter that is easy to obtain in almost all patients and does not require the presence of tricuspid valvar regurgitation or an anatomical cardiac defect. We sought to examine the correlation of PAAT with estimated SPAP by TTE and create an equation to estimate the SPAP using PAAT. We performed a retrospective review of TTEs performed on neonates and young infants (4 months of age or younger) at our institution between April 2017 and December 2018, along with the corresponding medical records. We included TTEs that provided estimation for SPAP and at least one PAAT measurement. During the study period, 138 TTEs performed on 82 patients met the inclusion criteria. Strong correlation was delineated between PAAT and SPAP estimated by the maximum velocity of tricuspid valve regurgitation Doppler, correlation coefficient (r) = − 0.83. Moderate correlation was detected between PAAT and SPAP estimated by PDA Doppler, r = − 0.66. Utilizing the following equation “SPAP = 82.6 − 0.58 × PAAT + RA mean pressure”, PAAT can be used to estimate SPAP in neonates and young infants. PAAT can be used as an alternative to TR jet to assess SPAP when the latter is absent or insufficient. Further studies are needed to verify the accuracy of this equation.","Mohammad Nijres, Bassel; Bokowski, John; Mubayed, Lamya; Jafri, Sabih H.; Davis, Alan T.; Abdulla, Ra-id",Pediatr Cardiol,227,12

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Two urban (Dhaka city north and Dhaka city south) and two rural (Narsinghdi and Gazipur district) areas of the Dhaka division. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 4856 male and female participants were included in the final analysis, of whom 2340 (48.2%) were from urban and 2516 (51.8%) were from rural areas. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Hypertension was the dependent variable for this study and was operationally defined as systolic blood pressure >140 mm of Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure >90 mm of Hg, and/or persons with already diagnosed hypertension. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of hypertension was 31.0%, and the prevalence was higher among urban participants (urban: 36.9%, rural: 30.6%). Age (across all categories), female (urban—adjusted OR (AOR): 1.3, 95% CI: 1.0 to 1.5 and rural—AOR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.4 to 2.1)), higher educational status (urban—AOR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.3 to 2.2 and rural—AOR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.5 to 3.1), inadequate physical activity (urban—AOR: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.0 to 1.7 and rural—AOR: 1.5, 95% CI: 1.2 to 1.9) and overweight/obesity (urban—AOR: 2.7, 95% CI: 2.1 to 3.3 and rural—AOR: 2.1, 95% CI: 1.7 to 2.5) were associated with hypertension in both urban and rural areas. Women who were not currently married during the survey had higher odds of hypertension only in the rural areas (rural—AOR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.3 to 2.4), and respondents who were not working during the survey had higher odds of hypertension only in the urban areas (AOR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.0 to 2.6). CONCLUSION: Since the prevalence of hypertension was high in urban and rural areas, the government of Bangladesh should consider implementing hypertension prevention programmes focusing young population of Dhaka division.

The Needs Assessment Tool-Cancer (NAT-C) is a validated, structured method of assessing patient/carer concerns and prompting action, to address unmet need. AIMS: Assess feasibility and acceptability of a definitive two-armed cluster randomised trial of NAT-C in primary care by evaluating: recruitment of GP practices, patients and carers; most effective approach of ensuring NAT-C appointments, acceptability of study measures and follow-up. METHODS: Non-blinded, feasibility study in four General Practices, with cluster randomisation to method of NAT-C appointment delivery, and process evaluation. Adults with active cancer were invited to participate with or without carer. Practices cluster randomised (1:1) to Arm I: promotion and use of NAT-C with a NAT-C trained clinician or Arm II: clinician of choice irrespective of training status. Participants completed study questionnaires at: baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months. Patients booked a 20 minute needs-assessment appointment post-baseline. Patients, carers and GP practice staff views regarding the study sought through interviews/focus groups. Quantitative data were analysed descriptively. Qualitative data were analysed thematically, informed by Normalisation Process Theory. Progression to a definitive trial was assessed against feasibility outcomes, relating to: recruitment rate, uptake and delivery of the NAT-C, data collection and quality. RESULTS: Five GP practices approached, four recruited and trained to use the NAT-C. Forty-seven participants and 17 carers recruited. At baseline, 34/47 (72%) participants reported at least one moderate-severe unmet need, confirming study rationale. 32/47 (68%) participants received a NAT-C-guided consultation, 19 of which on Arm I. Study attrition at one month (n = 44 (94%), n = 16 (94%)), three months (n = 38 (81%), n = 14 (82%)) and six months (n = 32 (68%), n = 10 (59%)). Fifteen patient interviews conducted across the whole study and one focus group at each GP practice. Participants supported a definitive study and found measures acceptable. CONCLUSION: The feasibility trial indicated that recruitment rate, intervention uptake and data collection were appropriate, with refinements, for a definitive multi-centre cluster randomised controlled trial. Feasibility outcomes informed the design of a 2-armed cluster randomised controlled trial to test the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the NAT-C compared with usual care.","Clark, Joseph; Amoakwa, Elvis; Wright-Hughes, Alexandra; Blenkinsopp, John; Currow, David C.; Meads, David; Farrin, Amanda; Allgar, Victoria; Macleod, Una; Johnson, Miriam",PLoS One,227,22

Several types of TLRs are known to contribute to the inflammatory process after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT), so UNC93B1 might play integral roles there. We investigated the influence of the UNC93B1 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs308328 (T>C) on transplant outcomes in a cohort of 237 patients undergoing unrelated HLA-matched bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for hematologic malignancies through the Japan Marrow Donor Program.

Hence, patient management needs awareness of the pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST). This study was aimed to assess the type of bacterial isolates and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns among pneumonia suspected patients at Dessie Referral Hospital, Northeast Ethiopia. Potential risk factors were also assessed to apply preventive measures accordingly. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study design was employed among pneumonia suspected patients from February to April 2020 at Dessie Referral Hospital. Sociodemographic characteristics and associated risk factors were collected using a pretested questionnaire, and clinical data were extracted by reviewing medical records. Sputum specimens were collected and inoculated into chocolate agar, blood agar, mannitol salt agar, and MacConkey agar which are then incubated at 35°C or 37°C for 24–48 hours. Bacterial species were identified based on Gram stain, colony characteristics, and biochemical techniques. The data were entered in to Epi-Info version 7.1.5 and analyzed with SPSS software version 20. p value <0.05 at 95% CI was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 406 sputum specimens were collected and cultured, among which 157 (38.7%) were positive for different bacterial pathogens. The predominant pathogens were Klebsiella pneumoniae (28.0%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (24.8%), Staphylococcus aureus (18.5%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.0%). Majority of the isolates exhibited resistance to ampicillin with 81.5% followed by penicillin with 75.9% and amoxicillin-clavulanate with 61.2%. Multivariable logistic regression showed a significant association of culture positivity with older age (AOR = 2.43, CI: 1.12–5.28, p value = 0.025), cigarette smoking (AOR = 4.67, CI: 2.39–9.20, p value <0.001), and alcohol use (AOR = 5.58, CI: 3.14–9.92, p value <0.001). Resistance to ampicillin and penicillin was associated with repeated prescription and use. CONCLUSIONS: This study found high prevalence of bacterial pneumonia in the study area, and high rate of bacterial resistance was observed in ampicillin, penicillin, and amoxicillin-clavulanate. Repeated prescriptions and use of antimicrobials were significantly independent factors of bacterial resistance. Therefore, patient management needs identification of bacteria by routine culture with antimicrobial susceptibility testing.","Dessie, Tewodros; Jemal, Mohabaw; Maru, Minwuyelet; Tiruneh, Moges",Int J Microbiol,227,1

In these multicellular eukaryotes, innate immunity implies the presence of cell surface receptors and intracellular receptors able to detect danger signal referred as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Membrane-associated pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), receptor-like kinases (RLKs), and receptor-like proteins (RLPs) are employed by these organisms for sensing different invasion patterns before triggering antimicrobial defenses that can be associated with a form of regulated cell death. Intracellularly, animals nucleotide-binding and oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors or plants nucleotide-binding domain (NBD)-containing leucine rich repeats (NLRs) immune receptors likely detect effectors injected into the host cell by the pathogen to hijack the immune signaling cascade. Interestingly, during the co-evolution between the hosts and their invaders, key cross-kingdom cell death-signaling macromolecular NLR-complexes have been selected, such as the inflammasome in mammals and the recently discovered resistosome in plants. In both cases, a regulated cell death located at the site of infection constitutes a very effective mean for blocking the pathogen spread and protecting the whole organism from invasion. This review aims to describe the immune mechanisms in animals and plants, mainly focusing on cell death signaling pathways, in order to highlight recent advances that could be used on one side or the other to identify the missing signaling elements between the perception of the invasion pattern by immune receptors, the induction of defenses or the transmission of danger signals to other cells. Although knowledge of plant immunity is less advanced, these organisms have certain advantages allowing easier identification of signaling events, regulators and executors of cell death, which could then be exploited directly for crop protection purposes or by analogy for medical research.","Roudaire, Thibault; Héloir, Marie-Claire; Wendehenne, David; Zadoroznyj, Aymeric; Dubrez, Laurence; Poinssot, Benoit",Front Immunol,227,7

Mucosal barrier injury due to high-dose conditioning regimen administered during autologous and allogeneic peripheral stem cell transplantation (APSCT) has neither efficient therapy nor established biomarkers. Our aim was to assess the biomarker role of OPN during APSCT, with primary focus on oral mucositis (OM). Serum and salivary OPN levels were determined by ELISA in 10 patients during APSCT at four stages of transplantation (day −3/−7, 0, +7, +14), and in 23 respective healthy controls. Results: There was a negative correlation between both salivary and serum OPN levels and grade of OM severity during APSCT (r = −0.791, p = 0.019; r = −0.973, p = 0.001). Salivary OPN increased at days +7 (p = 0.011) and +14 (p = 0.034) compared to controls. Among patients, it was higher at day +14 compared to the time of admission (day −3/−7) (p = 0.039) and transplantation (day 0) (p = 0.011). Serum OPN remained elevated at all four stages of transplantation compared to controls (p = 0.013, p = 0.02, p = 0.011, p = 0.028). During APSCT elevated salivary OPN is a potential non-invasive biomarker of oral mucositis whereas the importance of high serum OPN warrants further studies.","Gebri, Enikő; Kiss, Attila; Tóth, Ferenc; Hortobágyi, Tibor",Metabolites,227,1

Since exosomes circulate through bodily fluids, they can transfer information not only to local cells but also to remote cells. Therefore, exosomes are considered potential biomarkers for various treatments. Recently, studies have shown the efficacy of exosomes in skin defects such as aging, atopic dermatitis, and wounds. Also, exosomes are being studied to be used as ingredients in commercialized skin treatment products. In this review, we discussed the need for exosomes in skin therapy together with the current challenges. Moreover, the functional roles of exosomes in terms of skin treatment and regeneration are overviewed. Finally, we highlighted the major limitations and the future perspective in exosome engineering.","Yang, Gi Hoon; Lee, Yoon Bum; Kang, Donggu; Choi, Eunjeong; Nam, Yoonju; Lee, Kyoung Ho; You, Hi-Jin; Kang, Hyo Jin; An, Sang Hyun; Jeon, Hojun",Biomater Res,227,1

Articles (October 2019–March 2020) published in three representative neurosurgical journals (Acta Neurochirurgica, Journal of Neurosurgery, Neurosurgery) were analyzed with regard to female participation. Out of 648 publications, 503 original articles were analyzed: 17.5% (n = 670) of the 3.821 authors were female, with 15.7% (n = 79) females as first and 9.5% (n = 48) as last authors. The lowest ratio of female first and last authors was seen in original articles published in the JNS (12.3%/7.7% vs. Neurosurgery 14.9%/10.6% and Acta 23.0/11.5%). Articles originated in Europe made up 29.8% (female author ratio 21.1% (n = 226)). Female first authorship was seen in 20.7% and last authorship in 10.7% (15.3% and 7.3% were affiliated to a neurosurgical department). The percentages of female authorship were lower if non-original articles (n = 145) were analyzed (11.7% first/4.8% last authorships). Female participation in editorial boards was 8.0%. Considering the percentages of European female neurosurgeons, the current data are proportional. However, the lack of female last authors, the discrepancy regarding non-original articles and the composition of the editorial boards indicate that there still is a structural underrepresentation and that females are limited in achieving powerful positions.","Conzen, Catharina; Hakvoort, Karlijn; Clusmann, Hans; Höllig, Anke",Brain Sci,227,27

While adverse outcomes can be reduced through prompt initiation of sepsis protocols including fluid resuscitation and antibiotics, provision of these therapies relies on clinician recognition of sepsis. Recognition is challenging in children because early signs of shock such as tachycardia and tachypnea have low specificity while hypotension often does not occur until late in the clinical course. This narrative review highlights the important context that has led to the rapid growth of pediatric sepsis screening in the United States. In this review, we (1) describe different screening tools used in US emergency department, inpatient, and intensive care unit settings; (2) highlight details of the design, implementation, and evaluation of specific tools; (3) review the available data on the process of integrating sepsis screening into an overall sepsis quality improvement program and on the effect of these screening tools on patient outcomes; (4) discuss potential harms of sepsis screening including alarm fatigue; and (5) highlight several future directions in sepsis screening, such as novel tools that incorporate artificial intelligence and machine learning methods to augment sepsis identification with the ultimate goal of precision-based approaches to sepsis recognition and treatment. IMPACT: This narrative review highlights the context that has led to the rapid growth of pediatric sepsis screening nationally. Screening tools used in US emergency department, inpatient, and intensive care unit settings are described in terms of their design, implementation, and clinical performance. Limitations and potential harms of these tools are highlighted, as well as future directions that may lead to a more precision-based approach to sepsis recognition and treatment.","Eisenberg, Matthew A.; Balamuth, Fran",Pediatr Res,227,33

It is thought to further revolutionise the entire field in the near future. This study explored Ghanaian radiographers’ perspectives on the integration of AI into medical imaging. METHODS: A cross‐sectional online survey of registered Ghanaian radiographers was conducted within a 3‐month period (February‐April, 2020). The survey sought information relating to demography, general perspectives on AI and implementation issues. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used for data analyses. RESULTS: A response rate of 64.5% (151/234) was achieved. Majority of the respondents (n = 122, 80.8%) agreed that AI technology is the future of medical imaging. A good number of them (n = 131, 87.4%) indicated that AI would have an overall positive impact on medical imaging practice. However, some expressed fears about AI‐related errors (n = 126, 83.4%), while others expressed concerns relating to job security (n = 35, 23.2%). High equipment cost, lack of knowledge and fear of cyber threats were identified as some factors hindering AI implementation in Ghana. CONCLUSIONS: The radiographers who responded to this survey demonstrated a positive attitude towards the integration of AI into medical imaging. However, there were concerns about AI‐related errors, job displacement and salary reduction which need to be addressed. Lack of knowledge, high equipment cost and cyber threats could impede the implementation of AI in medical imaging in Ghana. These findings are likely comparable to most low resource countries and we suggest more education to promote credibility of AI in practice.","Botwe, Benard O.; Antwi, William K.; Arkoh, Samuel; Akudjedu, Theophilus N.",J Med Radiat Sci,227,13

The infants were classified in two groups based on whether they were treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or surgical ligation to close the PDA from the second week after birth. We compared the echocardiographic indices between the two groups and utilized the indices to construct a model to predict which premature infants’ PDA requires intervention. The results showed that a total of forty-two preterm infants were enrolled in the study. 15 (35.7%) preterms were in the intervention group and 27 (64.3%) preterms were in the non-intervention group. Compared with the non-intervention group, the intervention group had a higher proportion of left ventricular volume overload and systemic shunt effect. In addition, the combined indicators of PDA size/weight > 3.2 mm/kg and LA/Ao > 1.4 at postnatal age of 72 h had a highest value to predict whether PDA requires intervention. These findings denoted that serial daily echocardiographic assessment can be useful in predicting whether a PDA will be closed with NSAIDs and/or surgical ligation in preterm infants with gestational age ≤ 30 weeks.

METHODS: The study group was composed of patients who referred to a specialized DF centre due to DFUs. Those were divided in two groups: early referral (ER) and late referral (LR) patients. According to FTP, ER were considered patients who referred after 2 weeks in the case of uncomplicated non-healing ulcers (superficial, not infected, not ischemic), within 4 days in the case of complicated ulcers (ischemic, deep, mild infection) and within 24 h in the case of severely complicated ulcers (abscess, wet gangrene, fever). Healing, healing time, minor and major amputation, hospitalization, and survival were evaluated. The follow-up was 6 months. RESULTS: Two hundred patients were recruited. The mean age was 70 ± 13 years, 62.5% were male, 91% were affected by type 2 diabetes with a mean duration of 18 ± 11 years. Within the group, 79.5% had ER while 20.5% had LR. ER patients showed increased rates of healing (89.9 vs. 41.5%, p = 0.001), reduced healing time (10 vs. 16 weeks, p = 0.0002), lower rates of minor (17.6 vs. 75.6%, p < 0.0001) and major amputation (0.6 vs. 36.6%, p < 0.0001), hospitalization (47.1 vs. 82.9%, p = 0.001), and mortality (4.4 vs. 19.5%, p = 0.02) in comparison to LR. At multivariate analysis, ER was an independent predictor of healing, while LR was an independent predictor for minor and major amputation and hospitalization. CONCLUSION: After the FTP implementation, less cases of LR were reported in comparison to ER. ER was an independent predictor of positive outcomes such as healing, healing time, limb salvage, hospitalization, and survival.","Meloni, Marco; Lazaro-Martínez, Jose Luis; Ahluwalia, Raju; Bouillet, Benjamin; Izzo, Valentina; Di Venanzio, Michela; Iacopi, Elisabetta; Manu, Chris; Garcia-Klepzig, José Luis; Sánchez-Ríos, Juan Pedro; Lüedemann, Claas; De Buruaga, Víctor Rodriguez-Saenz; Vouillarmet, Julien; Guillaumat, Jérôme; Aleandri, Anna Rita; Giurato, Laura; Edmonds, Micheal; Piaggesi, Alberto; Van Acker, Kristien; Uccioli, Luigi",Acta Diabetol,227,27

Gibbs free energy changes and activation free energies of 17 XRH(•+) releasing H(•) [denoted as ΔG(HD)(o)(XRH(•+)) and ΔG(HD)(≠)(XRH(•+))] were calculated using density functional theory (DFT) and compared with that of Hantzsch ester (HEH(2)) and NADH. ΔG(HD)(o)(XRH(•+)) range from 19.35 to 31.25 kcal/mol, significantly lower than that of common antioxidants (such as ascorbic acid, BHT, the NADH coenzyme, and so forth). ΔG(HD)(≠)(XRH(•+)) range from 29.81 to 39.00 kcal/mol, indicating that XRH(•+) spontaneously releasing H(•) are extremely slow unless catalysts or active intermediate radicals exist. According to the computed data, it can be inferred that the Gibbs free energies and activation free energies of the core 1,4-dihydropyridine radical cation structure (DPH(•+)) releasing H(•) [ΔG(HD)(o)(DPH(•+)) and ΔG(HD)(≠)(DPH(•+))] should be 19–32 kcal/mol and 29–39 kcal/mol in acetonitrile, respectively. The correlations between the thermodynamic driving force [ΔG(HD)(o)(XRH(•+))] and the activation free energy [ΔG(HD)(≠)(XRH(•+))] are also explored. Gibbs free energy is the important and decisive parameter, and ΔG(HD)(≠)(XRH(•+)) increases in company with the increase of ΔG(HD)(o)(XRH(•+)), but no simple linear correlations are found. Even though all XRH(•+) are judged as excellent antioxidants from the thermodynamic view, the computed data indicate that whether XRH(•+) is an excellent antioxidant in reaction is decided by the R substituents in 4-position. XRH(•+) with nonaromatic substituents tend to release R(•) instead of H(•) to quench radicals. XRH(•+) with aromatic substituents tend to release H(•) and be used as antioxidants, but not all aromatic substituted Hantzsch esters are excellent antioxidants.","Shen, Guang-Bin; Xie, Li; Wang, Yun-Xia; Gong, Teng-Yang; Wang, Bin-Yu; Hu, Yu-He; Fu, Yan-Hua; Yan, Maocai",ACS Omega,227,22

Over the last decade, however, powerful experimental approaches have emerged to characterize variant effects orders of magnitude faster than before. Fueled by improved DNA synthesis and sequencing and, more recently, by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, multiplex functional assays provide a means of generating variant effect data in wide-ranging experimental systems.

In infected human hepatocytes, the HDV RNA genome can replicate and associate with multiple copies of the delta protein to assemble a ribonucleoprotein (RNP). However the RNP cannot exit the cell because of the lack of an export system. This is provided by the HBV envelope proteins, which are capable of budding at an internal cellular membrane to assemble mature HDV virions when RNPs are present. This review covers advances in the molecular aspects of the HDV-HBV interactions, with an emphasis on the HBV properties that are instrumental in HDV maturation, in particular the central role of the small HBV envelope protein.","Sureau, Camille",Hepatitis Delta Virus,227,12

We show that BCGs can be naturally embedded in HBCGs. It turns out that, as BCGs are equivalent to context-free grammars, HBCGs are equivalent to hyperedge replacement grammars in generalized Greibach normal form. We also present several structural properties of HBCGs. From practical point of view, we show that HBCGs can be used to describe semantics of sentences of natural languages. We incorporate the lambda semantics into the new mechanism in the same way as it is done for BCGs and show that such an embedding allows one to describe semantics of sentences with cross-serial dependencies.","Pshenitsyn, Tikhon",Graph Transformation,227,19

The risk following first stage caesarean sections, are less well defined, but appears to be increased in late-first stage of labour. The mechanism for this increased risk of late miscarriage and early spontaneous preterm birth in these women is unknown and there are uncertainties with regards to clinical management. Current predictive models of preterm birth (based on transvaginal ultrasound and quantitative fetal fibronectin) have not been validated in these women and it is unknown whether the threshold to define a short cervix (≤25 mm) is reliable in predicting the risk of preterm birth. In addition the efficacy of standard treatments or whether benefit may be derived from prophylactic interventions such as a cervical cerclage is unknown. METHODS: There are three distinct components to the CRAFT project (CRAFT-OBS, CRAFT-RCT and CRAFT-IMG). CRAFT-OBS: Observational Study; To evaluate subsequent pregnancy risk of preterm birth in women with a prior caesarean section in established labour. This prospective study of cervical length and quantitative fetal fibronectin data will establish a predictive model of preterm birth.

Current guidelines vary regarding the utility of arterial pH changes during the apnea test (AT). We aimed to study the effect of incorporating an arterial pH target < 7.30 during the AT (in addition to the existing PaCO(2) threshold) on brain death declarations. METHODS: We performed retrospective analysis of consecutive adult patients who were diagnosed with BD and underwent AT at the Cleveland Clinic over the last 10 years. Data regarding baseline and post-AT blood gas analyses were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients underwent AT in the study period, which was positive in 89 (91%) and inconclusive in 9 (9%) patients. The mean age was 50 years old (standard deviation [SD] 16) and 54 (55%) were female. The most common etiology BD was hypoxic ischemic brain injury (HIBI) due to cardiac arrest (42%). Compared to those with positive AT, patients with inconclusive AT had a higher post-AT pH (7.24 vs 7.17, p = 0.01), lower PaO(2) (47 vs 145, p < 0.01), and a lower PaCO(2) (55 vs 73, p = 0.01). Among patients with a positive AT using PaCO(2) threshold alone, the frequency of patients with post-AT pH < 7.30 was 95% (83/87). CONCLUSION: Implementing a BD criteria requiring both arterial pH and PaCO(2) thresholds reduced the total number of positive ATs; these inconclusive cases would have required longer duration of AT to reach both targets, repeated ATs, or ancillary studies to confirm BD. The impact of this on the overall number BD declarations requires further research.","Migdady, Ibrahim; Amin, Moein; Shoskes, Aaron; Hassett, Catherine; Cho, Sung-Min; George, Pravin; Rae-Grant, Alexander",J Intensive Care,227,1

The significant feature of this algorithm lies in that it does not require the derivation of the transition probability matrix for the corresponding embedded Markov chain.

It has been found in humans and cattle-derived food products. In humans, it is described as a potential risk factor for breast cancer development. However, the transmission path remains unclear. Here, a molecular epidemiology analysis was performed to identify signatures of genetic flux of BLV among humans, animals, and food products. Sequences obtained from these sources in Colombia were used (n = 183) and compared with reference sequences available in GenBank. Phylogenetic reconstruction was performed in IQ-TREE software with the maximum likelihood algorithm. Haplotype (hap) distribution among the population was carried out with a median-joining model in Network5.0. Recombination events were inferred using SplitsTree4 software. In the phylogenetic analysis, no specific branches were identified for the Colombian sequences or for the different sources. A total of 31 haps were found, with Hap 1, 4, 5 and 7 being shared among the three sources of the study. Reticulation events among the different sources were also detected during the recombination analysis. These results show new insights about the zoonotic potential of BLV, showing evidence of genetic flux between cattle and humans. Prevention and control strategies should be considered to avoid viral dissemination as part of the One Health program policies.","Corredor-Figueroa, Adriana P.; Olaya-Galán, Nury N.; Velandia-Álvarez, Sebastian; Muñoz, Marina; Salas-Cárdenas, Sandra P.; Ibáñez-Pinilla, Milcíades; Patarroyo, Manuel A.; Gutiérrez, Maria F.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,227,16

The rapid shift to blended teaching has meant changes to ways of teaching and learning. Author One (Australia) and Author Two (New Zealand) are tertiary academics in initial teacher education programmes. In this paper, they draw on narrative enquiry as a way to tell their stories of how they had to rapidly move from of face-to-face teaching to an emergency situation of online (cloud) teaching and learning. Through shared reflection, they offer a snapshot of their lived experience teaching music education, managing students and staff. In the findings, they discuss key challenges and opportunities they encountered in relation to student participation and engagement, teaching and learning, and wellbeing. Staying connected with each other across the Tasman Sea, using email and Zoom were important forms of providing mutual support that contributed positively to their sense of wellbeing as academics during this stressful time. They contend that universities need to consider the more human aspect of changes that have impacted staff and students. They question what the future will hold for initial teacher education programs post 2020. They suggest working collaboratively with schools, professional organisations, and industry when designing new programmes as the landscape of higher education changes due to the ongoing pandemic.","Joseph, Dawn; Trinick, Robyn",NZ J Educ Stud,227,1

Homeostatic synaptic plasticity (HSP) emerges as a compensatory mechanism used by neurons to adjust their excitability in response to changes in synaptic activity. Recently, glial cells emerged as modulators for neurotransmission by releasing gliotransmitters into the synaptic cleft through pathways that include P2X7 receptors (P2X7R), connexons, and pannexons. However, the role of gliotransmission in the activity-dependent adjustment of presynaptic strength is still an open question. Here, we investigated whether glial cells participate in HSP upon chronic inactivity and the role of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), connexin43 hemichannels (Cx43HCs), and pannexin1 (Panx1) channels in this process. We used immunocytochemistry against vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vGlut1) to estimate changes in synaptic strength in hippocampal dissociated cultures. Pharmacological manipulations indicate that glial-derived ATP and P2X7R are required for HSP. In addition, inhibition of Cx43 and Panx1 channels reveals a pivotal role for these channels in the compensatory adjustment of synaptic strength, emerging as new pathways for ATP release upon inactivity. The involvement of Panx1 channels was confirmed by using Panx1-deficient animals. Lacking Panx1 in neurons is sufficient to prevent the P2X7R-dependent upregulation of presynaptic strength; however, the P2X7R-dependent compensatory adjustment of synapse density requires both neuronal and glial Panx1. Together, our data supports an essential role for glial ATP signaling and Cx43HCs and Panx1 channels in the homeostatic adjustment of synaptic strength in hippocampal cultures upon chronic inactivity.","Rafael, Alberto; Cairus, Andrea; Tizzoni, Marina; Abudara, Verónica; Vitureira, Nathalia",Molecular neurobiology,227,24

Because of the authors' growing experience with laparoscopic liver and pancreatic surgery, they have begun offering patients laparoscopic completion partial hepatectomies of the gallbladder bed with laparoscopic hepatoduodenal lymphadenectomy. METHODS The video shows the steps needed to perform laparoscopic resection of the residual gallbladder bed, the hepatoduodenal lymph node nodes, and the residual cystic duct stump in a setting with a positive cystic stump margin. The skin and fascia around the previous extraction site are resected, and this site is used for specimen retrieval during the second operation. RESULTS To date, three patients have undergone laparoscopic radical cholecystectomy with hepatoduodenal lymph node dissection for gallbladder cancer. The average number of lymph nodes retrieved was 3 (range, 1-6), and the average estimated blood loss was 117 ml (range, 50-200 ml). The average operative time was 227 min (range, 120-360 min), and the average hospital length of stay was 4 days (range, 3-5 days). No morbidity or mortality was observed during 90 days of follow-up for each patient. CONCLUSION Although controversy exists as to the best surgical approach for gallbladder cancer diagnosed after routine laparoscopic cholecystectomy, the minimally invasive approach seems feasible and safe, even after previous hepatobiliary surgery. If the previous extraction site cannot be ascertained, all port sites can be excised locally. Larger studies are needed to determine whether the minimally invasive approach to postoperatively diagnosed early-stage gallbladder cancer has any drawbacks.","Gumbs, Andrew A; Hoffman, John P",Surgical endoscopy,227,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS The data of 140 patients with pneumonia in our hospital, including 70 who had COVID-19 and 70 who had community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), were statistically analyzed. The levels of PCT, IL-6, and CRP were measured and statistically analyzed to determine the differences between the two groups. The differences in the COVID-19 group were analyzed after subgrouping into the ordinary type, severe type, and critical type. RESULTS The PCT and CRP levels in the COVID-19 group were statistically lower than those in the CAP group (p < 0.05), but IL-6 was not statistically different between the two groups (p > 0.05). Statistically significant differences existed in IL-6 and CRP when comparing the COVID-19 subgroups of the critical type, severe type, and ordinary type (p < 0.05). However, there was no clinical meaning in the evaluation of the difference in PCT levels among the three subgroups with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS PCT and CRP could be used as indicators in the differentiation between COVID-19 and CAP, but IL-6 was of little significance in the differentiation. The higher the IL-6 and CRP, the more severe the condition of COVID-19 might be.","Zhou, Y-Z; Teng, X-B; Han, M-F; Shi, J-F; Li, C-X; Zhang, X-H; Hou, D-Y; Yang, L-L",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,227,5

While reversal will lead to weight regain and return of comorbid conditions, procedure reversal is sometimes necessary due to complications. The decision to reverse versus revise is difficult; currently, there are no established guidelines. The objective was to review one center's experience with reversals of gastric bypass and jejunoileal bypass procedures and identify potential indications as well as technical feasibility and short-term outcomes. A retrospective review of a prospectively collected database from 1999 to 2010 was conducted; 12 patients who underwent reversal of non-banding bariatric procedures were included. There was no major perioperative morbidity in elective patients; one patient whose reversal was part of a second-look operation had massive intestinal necrosis. There was one (8.3 %) non-procedure-related postoperative death. No leaks were identified in any of the reversals. Leak rates were compared with other revisional procedures such as reversals, revisions, and conversions, with no statistical significance regarding leak rates between all three groups; however, revisions and conversions were performed via open or laparoscopic approach, while reversals were performed exclusively via open approach. Reversals of bariatric (non-banding) procedures, either combined or purely malabsorptive, are technically challenging. Indications remain poorly defined. In our experience, short gut syndrome, renal failure, marginal ulceration, and malnutrition were the most common indications for reversal, differing from previously published data. Indications can depend on patient and surgeon preferences, but primarily on surgeon experience and type of complications. Based on this initial experience, these operations can be performed using the open approach with good outcomes.","Chousleb, Elias; Patel, Sheetal; Szomstein, Samuel; Rosenthal, Raul",Obesity surgery,227,29

However, no truly satisfactory treatment option is available to date for lesions arising from the P1 and P2 segments. The purpose of the present case series is to investigate both the efficacy and safety of the Pipeline Embolization Device in treating these challenging aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS We present a series of 6 consecutive patients who underwent endoluminal reconstruction with the Pipeline Embolization Device for nonsaccular P1 or P2 segment aneurysms between January 2009 and June 2013. RESULTS Aneurysm location included the P1 segment in 2 patients and the P2 segment in 4 patients. Mean aneurysm diameter was 23 mm (range, 5-44 mm). Mean length of the arterial segment involved was 10 mm (range, 6-19 mm). Clinical presentation included mass effect in 4 patients and perforator stroke and subacute aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in 1 patient each. Endovascular reconstruction was performed by using 1 Pipeline Embolization Device in 5 patients and 2 overlapping Pipeline Embolization Devices in the remaining patient. Angiographic aneurysm occlusion was immediate in 1 patient, within 6 months in 4 patients, and within 1 year in the remaining patient. Index symptoms resolved in 4 patients and stabilized in the remaining 2. No new permanent neurologic sequelae and no aneurysm recurrence were recorded during the mean follow-up period of 613 days (range, 540-725 days). CONCLUSIONS Endovascular reconstruction with the Pipeline Embolization Device for nonsaccular aneurysms arising from the P1 and P2 segments compares favorably with historical treatment options in terms of occlusion rate, margin of safety, and neurologic outcome.","Zumofen, D W; Shapiro, M; Becske, T; Raz, E; Potts, M B; Riina, H A; Nelson, P K",AJNR.

We aimed to investigate whether the type of first-line modality in EVT was associated with the need for RT. METHODS We identified all patients who underwent EVT for anterior circulation large-vessel occlusion from prospectively maintained registries of 17 stroke centers. Patients were dichotomized into SR-first and CA-first. RT involved switching to the other device, balloon angioplasty, permanent stenting, thrombolytics, glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonist, or any combination of these. We compared clinical characteristics, procedural details, and final recanalization rate between the two groups and assessed whether first-line modality type was associated with RT requirement and if this affected clinical outcome. RESULTS A total of 955 patients underwent EVT using either SR-first (n=526) or CA-first (n=429). No difference occurred in the final recanalization rate between SR-first (82.1%) and CA-first (80.2%). However, recanalization with the first-line modality alone and first-pass recanalization rates were significantly higher in SR-first than in CA-first. CA-first had more device passes and higher RT rate. The RT group had significantly longer puncture-to-recanalization time (93±48 min versus 53±28 min). After adjustment, CA-first remained associated with RT (OR, 1.367; 95% CI, 1.019 to 1.834). RT was negatively associated with good outcome (OR, 0.597; 95% CI, 0.410 to 0.870).

The GPC mixtures were prepared with a quadruple precursor simultaneously containing fly ash (FA), ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GBFS), metakaolin (MK), and Portland cement (OPC). Setting time, compressive along with adhesive strength and permeability, were tested and interpreted from a perspective of potential applications. The preferred GPC with favorable setting time (not shorter than 120 min) and desirable compressive strength (not lower than 35 MPa) was selected from 85 mixture formulations. The results indicate that balancing strength and setting behavior is viable with the aid of the multi-componential precursor and the mixture design based on total molar ratios of key oxides or chemical elements. Adhesive strength of the optimized GPC mixtures was ranged from 1.5 to 3.4 MPa. The induced charge passed based on a rapid test of coated concrete specimens with the preferred GPC was 30% lower than that of the uncoated ones. Setting time of GPC was positively correlated with η[Si/(Na+Al)]. An abrupt increase of setting time occurred when the molar ratio was greater than 1.1. Compressive strength of GPC was positively affected by mass contents of ground granulated blast furnace slag, metakaolin and ordinary Portland cement, and was negatively affected by mass content of fly ash, respectively. Sustained seawater immersion impaired the strength of GPC to a negligible extent. Overall, GPC potentially serves a double purpose of satisfying the usage requirements and achieving a cleaner future.","Jiang, Chenhui; Wang, Aiying; Bao, Xufan; Chen, Zefeng; Ni, Tongyuan; Wang, Zhangfu",Materials,227,16

We now estimate the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of increasing the number of centres from 24 to 30. METHODS We constructed a discrete event simulation (DES) to estimate the effectiveness and lifetime cost-effectiveness (from a payer perspective) using 1 year's incidence of stroke in England. 2000 iterations of the simulation were performed comparing baseline 24 centres to 30. RESULTS Of 80,800 patients admitted to hospital with acute stroke/year, 21,740 would be affected by the service reconfiguration. The median time to treatment for eligible early presenters (< 270 min since onset) would reduce from 195 (IQR 155-249) to 165 (IQR 105-224) minutes. Our model predicts reconfiguration would mean an additional 33 independent patients (modified Rankin scale [mRS] 0-1) and 30 fewer dependent/dead patients (mRS 3-6) per year. The net addition of 6 centres generates 190 QALYs (95%CI - 6 to 399) and results in net savings to the healthcare system of £1,864,000/year (95% CI -1,204,000 to £5,017,000). The estimated budget impact was a saving of £980,000 in year 1 and £7.07 million in years 2 to 5. CONCLUSION Changes in acute stroke service configuration will produce clinical and cost benefits when the time taken for patients to receive treatment is reduced. Benefits are highly likely to be cost saving over 5 years before any capital investment above £8 million is required.","McMeekin, Peter; Flynn, Darren; Allen, Mike; Coughlan, Diarmuid; Ford, Gary A; Lumley, Hannah; Balami, Joyce S; James, Martin A; Stein, Ken; Burgess, David; White, Phil",BMC health services research,227,1

The number of headers observed in small-sided games during training varied depending on the exact format used but generally speaking ranged between zero to one per player per game. The three most commonly reported biomechanical variables were head acceleration, head rotational velocity and overall movement kinematics during the heading action. Average head acceleration ranged from approximately four to 50 g. Nine out of 12 included studies did not observe a negative impact on cognitive test performance following exposure to heading and while three did, these negative effects were limited to specific outcome measures: reaction time and memory function. CONCLUSION The current weight of evidence summarised herein does not support the notion that heading is deleterious to cognitive performance in the short term; however, this conclusion is tentative due to methodological shortcomings in the existing evidence base.","McCunn, Robert; Beaudouin, Florian; Stewart, Katy; Meyer, Tim; MacLean, John",Sports medicine,227,7

This has become most evident with the current COVID-19 pandemic by the new coronavirus that is wreaking havoc across the planet. Health care providers are facing unprecedented challenges to intervene on numerous nonlinear uncertainties in science and society as the pandemic evolves. In Afghanistan, health care delivery is already a major crosscutting challenge. Although efforts to rebuild the health care systems in Afghanistan have been made (Acerra et al.), both acute and chronic illnesses remain as major medical and critical governance gaps to be remedied. In addition, health care facilities and medical equipment are not adequate in the country. There is a need for medical and scientific expertise to clinically and sociologically contextualize and interpret diagnostic tests as well as drugs and vaccines that will be deployed in the coming months as part of the planetary collective response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In a time of pandemic and facing a novel infectious pathogen, health care workers are in need of planetary scale consultation and support. Even creating a small consultation network using mobile applications might offer improved health outcomes.

The authors studied the experience and outcomes of patients who underwent repair of a ventral incisional hernia with biologic mesh. METHODS Online database and detailed reference searches were conducted. Studies chosen for review had a sample size of at least 40 patients, level IV evidence at most, and a Methodological Index for Nonrandomized Studies index of at least 10. Indications for use of biologic mesh, type of mesh, patient comorbidities, and surgical techniques were also noted. RESULTS Eight studies fulfilled the search criteria and included 635 patients using AlloDerm, Surgisis, and Strattice biologic tissue matrices. In one study, indications and surgical techniques were standardized, and follow-up was prospective. In the other seven studies, indications, surgical techniques, and follow-up were assessed retrospectively. The mean patient age, when reported, was 55.7 years. Body mass index ranged from 30 to 35 kg/m2 in 44 percent of the reported patients. In seven of the eight studies [565 patients (89 percent)], the mean follow-up was 25.8 months and the mean hernia recurrence rate was 21 percent. Complication rate exceeded 20 percent in most studies. CONCLUSIONS Biologic tissue matrices are mostly used in contaminated fields, which has allowed for a one-stage repair with no or little subsequent mesh removal. Ventral incisional hernia repair with these matrices continues to be plagued by a high recurrence rate and complications. Prospective randomized trials are needed to properly direct practice in the use of these meshes and evaluate their ultimate value.","Kissane, Nicole A; Itani, Kamal M F",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,227,1

RECENT FINDINGS In addition to trials that support the current Food and Drug Administration label and published over the past 3 years, the recently published Spironolactone With Patiromer in the Treatment of Resistant Hypertension in Chronic Kidney Disease (AMBER) trial provides clear benefits of patiromer use in a group of resistant hypertension patients. The AMBER was a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study that evaluated 295 participants stratified by local serum potassium measurement (4.3 to < 4.7 mmol/L vs 4.7 to 5.1 mmol/L) and history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease. The focus was on enabling participants with resistant hypertension to achieve blood pressure goals by using spironolactone. Additionally, the ongoing Patiromer for the Management of Hyperkalemia in Subjects Receiving RAASi Medications for the Treatment of Heart Failure (DIAMOND) trial is designed to demonstrate how patiromer is an ""enabler"" of therapies that are needed to either control resistant hypertension or reduce mortality in heart failure but generate hyperkalemia. These and other studies are discussed in detail. Patiromer is one of two new potassium binders that are far better tolerated than the previous agent and can be given chronically to participants who need life-saving therapies but have elevations of potassium into a dangerous range as a consequence.","Ali, Waleed; Bakris, George",Current cardiology reports,227,1

Palliative surgery has often been undertaken to improve quality of life (QOL), but few prospective studies on palliative surgery in this patient population have been published. PATIENTS AND METHODS We prospectively investigated the significance of palliative surgery using patient-reported QOL measures. Patients underwent palliative surgery by small intestine/colon resection or small intestine/colon bypass or ileostomy/colostomy for MBO. The primary endpoint was change in QOL assessed at baseline, 14 days, 1 month, and 3 months following palliative surgery using the Euro QoL Five Dimensions (EQ-5D™) questionnaire and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire gastric cancer module (QLQ-STO22). Secondary endpoints were postoperative improvement in oral intake and surgical complications. RESULTS Between April 2013 and March 2018, 63 patients were enrolled from 14 institutions. The mean EQ-5D™ utility index baseline score of 0.6 remained consistent. Gastric-specific symptoms mostly showed statistically significant improvement from baseline. Forty-two patients (67%) were able to eat solid food 2 weeks after palliative surgery and 36 patients (57%) tolerated it for 3 months. The rate of overall morbidity of ≥ grade III according to the Clavien-Dindo classification was 16% (10 patients) and the 30-day postoperative mortality rate was 3.2% (2 patients). CONCLUSIONS In patients with MBO caused by peritoneal dissemination of gastric cancer, palliative surgery did not improve QOL while improving solid food intake, with an acceptable postoperative morbidity and mortality rate.","Ito, Yuichi; Fujitani, Kazumasa; Sakamaki, Kentaro; Ando, Masahiko; Kawabata, Ryohei; Tanizawa, Yutaka; Yoshikawa, Takaki; Yamada, Takanobu; Hirao, Motohiro; Yamada, Makoto; Hihara, Jun; Fukushima, Ryoji; Choda, Yasuhiro; Kodera, Yasuhiro; Teshima, Shin; Shinohara, Hisashi; Kondo, Masato",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,227,13

The Science and Research Committee of the Rhinoplasty Society of Europe aimed at preparing consensus recommendations on safe rhinosurgery in general during the COVID-19 pandemic by appointing an international panel of experts also including delegates of The Rhinoplasty Society. METHODS A Zoom meeting was performed with a panel of 14 international leading experts in rhinosurgery. During 3.5 hours, four categories of questions on preoperative safety measures in private practice and outpatient clinics, patient assessment before and during surgery, and legal issues were presented by four chairs and discussed by the expert group. Afterward, the panelists were requested to express an online, electronic vote on each category and question. The panel's recommendations were based on current evidence and expert opinions. The resulting report was circled in an iterative open e-mail process until consensus was obtained. RESULTS Consensus was obtained in several important points on how to safely restart performing rhinosurgery in general. Preliminary recommendations with different levels of agreement were prepared and condensed in a bundle of safety measures.

Questions remain about the optimal imaging approach for FIV measurement. OBJECTIVE To examine the association of FIV with 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score and investigate its dependency on acquisition time and modality. METHODS Data of seven trials were pooled. FIV was assessed on follow-up (12 hours to 2 weeks) CT or MRI. Infarct location was defined as laterality and involvement of the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score regions. Relative quality and strength of multivariable regression models of the association between FIV and functional outcome were assessed. Dependency of imaging modality and acquisition time (≤48 hours vs >48 hours) was evaluated. RESULTS Of 1665 included patients, 83% were imaged with CT. Median FIV was 41 mL (IQR 14-120). A large FIV was associated with worse functional outcome (OR=0.88(95% CI 0.87 to 0.89) per 10 mL) in adjusted analysis. A model including FIV, location, and hemorrhage type best predicted mRS score. FIV of ≥133 mL was highly specific for unfavorable outcome. FIV was equally strongly associated with mRS score for assessment on CT and MRI, even though large differences in volume were present (48 mL (IQR 15-131) vs 22 mL (IQR 8-71), respectively). Associations of both early and late FIV assessments with outcome were similar in strength (ρ=0.60(95% CI 0.56 to 0.64) and ρ=0.55(95% CI 0.50 to 0.60), respectively). CONCLUSIONS In patients with an acute ischemic stroke due to a proximal intracranial occlusion of the anterior circulation, FIV is a strong independent predictor of functional outcome and can be assessed before 48 hours, oneither CT or MRI.","Boers, Anna M M; Jansen, Ivo G H; Beenen, Ludo F M; Devlin, Thomas G; San Roman, Luis; Heo, Ji Hoe; Ribó, Marc; Brown, Scott; Almekhlafi, Mohammed A; Liebeskind, David S; Teitelbaum, Jeanne; Lingsma, Hester F; van Zwam, Wim H; Cuadras, Patricia; du Mesnil de Rochemont, Richard; Beaumont, Marine; Brown, Martin M; Yoo, Albert J; van Oostenbrugge, Robert J; Menon, Bijoy K; Donnan, Geoffrey A; Mas, Jean Louis; Roos, Yvo B W E M; Oppenheim, Catherine; van der Lugt, Aad; Dowling, Richard J; Hill, Michael D; Davalos, Antoni; Moulin, Thierry; Agrinier, Nelly; Demchuk, Andrew M; Lopes, Demetrius K; Aja Rodríguez, Lucia; Dippel, Diederik W J; Campbell, Bruce C V; Mitchell, Peter J; Al-Ajlan, Fahad S; Jovin, Tudor G; Madigan, Jeremy; Albers, Gregory W; Soize, Sebastien; Guillemin, Francis; Reddy, Vivek K; Bracard, Serge; Blasco, Jordi; Muir, Keith W; Nogueira, Raul G; White, Phil M; Goyal, Mayank; Davis, Stephen M; Marquering, Henk A; Majoie, Charles B L M",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,227,29

The leading cause of death among COVID-19 patients is acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by hyper inflammation secondary to cytokine release syndrome (CRS). Cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, interferon (IFN)-γ, and IL-10, are the main mediators of CRS. Based on recent evidence, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) II is known to be the target of the COVID-19 spike protein, which enables the virus to penetrate human cells. ACE II also possesses an anti-inflammatory role in many pathologies such as CVD (Cardiovascular Disease), HTN (Hypertension), DM (Diabetes Mellitus), and other conditions, which are the main risk factors of poor prognosis in COVID-19 infection. Changes in tissue ACE II levels are associated with many diseases and hyperinflammatory states, and it is assumed that elevated levels of ACE II could aggravate the course of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the use of Renin-Angiotensin, Aldosterone System Inhibitors (RASi) in COVID-19 patients could be hypothetically considered, though sufficient evidence is not presented by the scientific community. In the present manuscript, based on the most recent pieces of evidence, the roles of RAS and RASi in immunologic interactions are addressed. Furthermore, the molecular and immunologic aspects of RASi and their potential significance in COVID-19 is discussed.","Hallaj, Shahin; Ghorbani, Anahita; Mousavi-Aghdas, Seyed Ali; Mirza-Aghazadeh-Attari, Mohammad; Sevbitov, Andrey; Hashemi, Vida; Hallaj, Tooba; Jadidi-Niaragh, Farhad",Immunology and cell biology,227,12

Supervised exercise delivered via telehealth has the potential to overcome barriers to increased physical activity in stroke survivors. Our scoping review will examine the emerging field of supervised exercise delivered via telehealth to map the available evidence in relation to its efficacy, acceptability, safety and feasibility in chronic conditions to inform future research into its ability to increase physical activity. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley will be applied to our scoping review. A systematic search of Medline, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane, Pedro and Embase; hand searching of pertinent studies' reference lists; and consultation with experts in the field will identify relevant papers. Studies involving participants with a chronic condition who undertake supervised exercise delivered by a health professional via telehealth targeted at improving secondary stroke risk factors or involving lower limb weight-bearing exercise will be included. Study selection and critical appraisal of individual studies will be carried out independently by two authors with discrepancies resolved by a third author. Quantitative and qualitative data will be charted using a standardised form. Results will be tabulated and narratively summarised to highlight findings relevant to the review's research questions and to inform recommendations for future research. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Our review will significantly contribute to the knowledge base of exercise and rehabilitation delivered via telehealth and its application in chronic conditions, including stroke. Findings will be relevant to researchers, healthcare workers and policy-makers and will be disseminated through publication and presentations.

It has been argued that there is one more law of thermodynamics: entropy of microstructure decays in isolated systems. In this paper, we check this assertion experimentally for the process of grain growth. We show that entropy of grain structure decays indeed as expected. We study also the equation of state for microstructure entropy. In general, microstructure entropy should be a function of microstructure energy and the average grain size. We observed that the equation of state degenerates, and there is a universal dependence of microstructure entropy on microstructure energy, at least at the stage of self similar grain growth.","Vedanti, Pawan; Wu, Xin; Berdichevsky, Victor",Scientific reports,227,31

Moreover, treatment with licochalcone A and isoliquiritigenin as the active components, whose contents are increased by the roasting process, remarkably suppressed RANKL-induced osteoclast formation in BMMs, respectively. Furthermore, orally administered rLE substantially blocked tumor growth and bone destruction in mice inoculated with breast cancer cells in the tibiae. Serum levels of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I collagen and trabecular bone morphometric parameters were reversed to almost the same levels as the control mice by the rLE treatment. In conclusion, rLE may be a beneficial agent for preventing and treating bone destruction in patients with breast cancer.","Lee, Sun Kyoung; Park, Kwang-Kyun; Park, Jung Han Yoon; Lim, Soon Sung; Chung, Won-Yoon",Phytotherapy research : PTR,227,1

OBJECTIVES The goals of this study were to identify which equation to estimate GFR is superior for predicting adverse outcomes after PCI and to examine how equation selection would impact drug-dosing recommendations. METHODS Estimated GFR (eGFR) was calculated with the Cockcroft-Gault, Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (MDRD), and Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations for 128,805 patients undergoing PCI in the state of Michigan. Agreement between patient pre-PCI eGFR estimates and resultant CKD stage classifications, their ability to discriminate post-procedural in-hospital clinical outcomes, and the impact of equation choice on dosing recommendations for commonly used antiplatelet and antithrombotic medications were investigated. RESULTS CKD-EPI best discriminated post-PCI mortality by receiver operator characteristic analysis. There was wide variability in eGFR, which persisted after grouping by CKD stages. Reclassification by CKD-EPI resulted in net reclassification index improvement for acute kidney injury and new requirement for dialysis. Equation choice affected drug-dosing recommendations, with the formulas agreeing for only 50.3%, 40.0%, and 34.3% of potentially impacted patients for eGFR cutoffs of <60, <50, and <30 ml/min/1.73 m(2), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Different eGFR equations result in CKD stage reclassification that has major clinical implications for predicting adverse outcomes after PCI and drug-dosing recommendations. Our results support the use of CKD-EPI for risk stratification among patients undergoing PCI.","Parsh, Jessica; Seth, Milan; Aronow, Herbert; Dixon, Simon; Heung, Michael; Mehran, Roxana; Gurm, Hitinder S",Journal of the American College of Cardiology,227,26

However, more preclinical studies of HDAC inhibitors in NSCLC and normal lung epithelial cells are required to evaluate their antitumor activities and mechanisms. The bicellular tight junction molecule claudin-2 (CLDN-2) is highly expressed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues and increase the proliferation of adenocarcinoma cells. Downregulation of the tricellular tight junction molecule angulin-1/LSR induces malignancy via EGF-dependent CLDN-2 and TGF-β-dependent cellular metabolism in human lung adenocarcinoma cells. In the present study, to investigate the detailed mechanisms of the antitumor activities of HDAC inhibitors in lung adenocarcinoma, human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells and normal lung epithelial cells were treated with the HDAC inibitors Trichostatin A (TSA) and Quisinostat (JNJ-2648158) with or without TGF-β. Both HDAC inhibitors increased anguin-1/LSR, decrease CLDN-2, promoted G1 arrest and prevented the migration of A549 cells. Furthermore, TSA but not Quisinostat with or without TGF-β induced cellular metabolism indicated as the mitochondrial respiration measured using the oxygen consumption rate. In normal human lung epithelial cells, treatment with TSA and Quisinostat increased expression of LSR and CLDN-2 and decreased that of CLDN-1 with or without TGF-β in 2D culture. Quisinostat but not TSA with TGF-β increased CLDN-7 expression in 2D culture. Both HDAC inhibitors prevented disruption of the epithelial barrier measured as the permeability of FD-4 induced by TGF-β in 2.5D culture. TSA and Quisinostat have potential for use in therapy for lung adenocarcinoma via changes in the expression of angulin-1/LSR and CLDN-2.","Shindo, Yuma; Arai, Wataru; Konno, Takumi; Kohno, Takayuki; Kodera, Yuki; Chiba, Hirofumi; Miyajima, Masahiro; Sakuma, Yuji; Watanabe, Atsushi; Kojima, Takashi",Histochemistry and cell biology,227,12

Our objective was to evaluate the impact of decreased mumps vaccination due to COVID-19 on the disease burden of mumps in Japan. Using a previously validated dynamic transmission model of mumps infection in Japan, the incidence rate of mumps over the next 30 y since July 2020 was estimated. The estimated average incidences were 269.1, 302.0, and 455.4/100,000 person-years in rapid recovery, slow recovery, and permanent decline scenarios. Compared with the rapid recovery scenario, the incremental number of mumps cases, total costs, and QALYs loss over the next 30 y were 6.53 million cases, 2.63 billion USD, and 49,246 for the permanent decline scenario, respectively. In conclusion, the persistent decline of mumps vaccination rate as an impact of COVID-19 causes a significant incremental disease burden of mumps, which is consistent irrespective of the possible decline of transmission rate of mumps infection, unless the rapid recovery of coverage rate is achieved. The immediate measures to advocate the vaccination program is essential to mitigate the incremental disease burden in the COVID-19 period.","Kitano, Taito; Aoki, Hirosato",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,227,1

A meta-analysis.,19.172165,8.742701,2013,"BACKGROUND One Health (OH) is an interdisciplinary collaborative approach to human and animal health that aims to break down conventional research and policy 'silos'. OH has been used to develop strategies for zoonotic Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID). However, the ethical case for OH as an alternative to more traditional public health approaches is largely absent from the discourse. To study the ethics of OH, we examined perceptions of the human health and ecological priorities for the management of zoonotic EID in the Southeast Asia country of Singapore. METHODS We conducted a mixed methods study using a modified Delphi technique with a panel of 32 opinion leaders and 11 semi-structured interviews with a sub-set of those experts in Singapore. Panellists rated concepts of OH and priorities for zoonotic EID preparedness planning using a series of scenarios developed through the study. Interview data were examined qualitatively using thematic analysis. FINDINGS We found that panellists agreed that OH is a cross-disciplinary collaboration among the veterinary, medical, and ecological sciences, as well as relevant government agencies encompassing animal, human, and environmental health. Although human health was often framed as the most important priority in zoonotic EID planning, our qualitative analysis suggested that consideration of non-human animal health and welfare was also important for an effective and ethical response. The panellists also suggested that effective pandemic planning demands regional leadership and investment from wealthier countries to better enable international cooperation. CONCLUSION We argue that EID planning under an OH approach would benefit greatly from an ethical ecological framework that accounts for justice in human, animal, and environmental health.","Lysaght, Tamra; Capps, Benjamin; Bailey, Michele; Bickford, David; Coker, Richard; Lederman, Zohar; Watson, Sangeetha; Tambyah, Paul Anantharajah",PloS one,227,31

With the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, researchers have turned to more non-traditional sources of clinical data to characterize the disease in near-real time, study the societal implications of interventions, as well as the sequelae that recovered COVID-19 cases present. However, manually curated social media datasets are difficult to come by due to the expensive costs of manual annotation and the efforts needed to identify the correct texts. When datasets are available, they are usually very small and their annotations don't generalize well over time or to larger sets of documents. As part of the 2021 Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon, we release our dataset of over 120 million automatically annotated tweets for biomedical research purposes. Incorporating best-practices, we identify tweets with potentially high clinical relevance. We evaluated our work by comparing several SpaCy-based annotation frameworks against a manually annotated gold-standard dataset. Selecting the best method to use for automatic annotation, we then annotated 120 million tweets and released them publicly for future downstream usage within the biomedical domain.","Hernandez, Luis Alberto Robles; Callahan, Tiffany J; Banda, Juan M",Genomics & informatics,227,16

It has been demonstrated to outperform the more widely used Mayo endoscopic score (MES) in predicting long-term prognosis, including the need for colectomy. Despite its potential benefits, many clinicians still prefer to use MES because its operating characteristics are better defined and its grades are more readily applicable to clinical decision-making. The aims of our study were to quantify the UCEIS cutoff most closely associated with the need for treatment escalation and to perform a validation exercise using MES and clinical, biochemical, and histological measures of disease activity. METHODS Endoscopies performed in UC patients between November 2016 and January 2018 were retrospectively reviewed. Agreement between the UCEIS and MES was quantified using Kappa (κ) statistics. A UCEIS cutoff for treatment escalation was calculated using chi-square, receiver operating characteristic curve, and area under the curve (AUC) analyses. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to compare linear relationships between UCEIS and clinical (Simple Clinical Colitis Activity Index [SCCAI]), biochemical (C-reactive protein [CRP]), and histological (Nancy Histological Index [NHI]) activity. RESULTS Two hundred one (56%) procedures documented both UCEIS and MES, demonstrating substantial agreement (κ = 0.713; P < 0.001). Treatment was escalated after 199 (56%) procedures. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of need for treatment escalation showed the highest sensitivity and specificity for UCEIS ≥4 (0.80 and 0.93, respectively; AUC, 0.93). Of 170 patients with a UCEIS ≥4, treatment was escalated in 159 (94%), but not for 11 (6%). Of 185 patients with a UCEIS ≤3, 40 (22%) were escalated, whereas 145 (78%) were not (P < 0.001). UCEIS correlated strongly with NHI (0.723; P < 0.001), moderately with SCCAI (0.671; P < 0.001), and weakly with CRP (0.279; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS A UCEIS ≥4 was significantly associated with treatment escalation. This cutoff could therefore be used to support clinical decision-making based on endoscopic findings. Strong and moderate correlations were found between UCEIS and histological and clinical disease activity, respectively, whereas a weak correlation was found with CRP. 10.1093/ibd/izy325_Video_1 izy325.video1 5849933952001.","de Jong, Djuna C; Löwenberg, Mark; Koumoutsos, Ioannis; Ray, Shuvra; Mawdsley, Joel; Anderson, Simon; Sanderson, Jeremy D; Gecse, Krisztina; Ponsioen, Cyriel Y; D'Haens, Geert R; Irving, Peter M; Samaan, Mark A",Inflammatory bowel diseases,227,1

OBJECTIVES To retrospectively review alteplase instillation in dysfunctional catheters used for RRT in dogs and cats. ANIMALS Seventeen dogs and 8 cats receiving RRT for kidney failure. METHODS Medical records of patients in which alteplase was used for RRT catheter dysfunction from 2004 to 2012 were retrospectively reviewed to characterize reasons for use, improvement in function, increase in blood flow, and duration of improvement. RESULTS Alteplase was instilled 43 times in 29 catheters, most commonly because of suspicion that the catheter would not provide sufficient flow on the next treatment (n = 21). The second most common reason was inability to start a dialysis treatment (n = 12). Catheter function improved after alteplase instillation in 34 of 43 treatments (79%). Median blood flow rate increased by 13% (18 mL/min) in the dialysis session after alteplase instillation. Seven of 29 catheters (24%) were treated with alteplase on >1 occasion (median time to second treatment, 8 days), and 1 catheter had to be replaced because of intractable dysfunction.

MATERIALS AND METHODS This mixed prospective-retrospective study included 41 patients who received QLB following induction of general anesthesia. Data collected included: the duration of block induction, surgery, hospitalization, postoperative pain score, and the use of rescue analgesia. The results were compared with a matched cohort of patients who received caudal block (CB) during similar surgeries from our retrospectively acquired data registry. RESULTS There was no difference between the type and length of surgery, weight, sex, and age of the patients between the two groups. The duration of block induction was significantly shorter in the CB group compared with the QLB group (35.6 ± 14.6 vs. 239 ± 33.4 seconds [p < 0.0001]). There was no difference between the groups in pain scores at 1, 4, and 24 hours postoperatively, in the time to first rescue analgesia, or in the postoperative opioid requirements. However, the QLB group required more rescue analgesia compared with CB group (p = 0.016). Finally, no differences were found in the use of rescue analgesics at home, pain record behavior, and overall satisfaction. CONCLUSION Our data show that QLB might serve as a viable alternative to CB in pediatric urological surgery.","Rotem, Shahar; Raisin, Galiya; Ostrovsky, Israel A; Kocherov, Stanislav; Jaber, Jawdat; Zeldin, Alexander; Feldman, Elena; Gozal, Yaacov; Chertin, Boris",European journal of pediatric surgery : official journal of Austrian Association of Pediatric Surgery ...

Because thiurams and dithiocarbamates have structural similarity, concomitant reactions are expected. METHODS The 1994-2016 North American Contact Dermatitis Group data were analyzed. Patients with a final reaction interpreted as ""allergic"" to either CM or TM were included. RESULTS A total of 49,758 patients were tested to both CM and TM. A total of 3437 (6.9%) had positive reactions to CM and/or TM including the following groups: CM+ only (n = 1403, 40.8%), TM+ only (n = 1068, 31.0%), or both (n = 966, 28.1%). A total of 47.5% of TM+ patients were positive to CM and 40.8% of CM+ patients were positive to TM. Male sex, occupationally related dermatitis, and hand involvement were significantly more common in individuals positive to CM and/or TM as compared with those who were negative (P < 0.0001).

98355,98355,98355,Protocol for treatment of Achilles tendon ruptures; a systematic review with network meta-analysis.,19.20597,8.749891,2018,"Systematic Reviews (SRs) hold promise for implementing the 3Rs in animal sciences: they can retrieve available alternative models, help refining experiments, and identify insufficiencies, or an excess of, scientific knowledge on a particular topic. Unfortunately, SRs can be labour- and time-intensive, especially the reference screening and data extraction phases. Fortunately, there are several software tools available that help make screening faster and easier. However, it is not always clear which features the tools offer. Therefore, a feature analysis was performed to compare different reference screening tools as objectively as possible. This analysis enables researchers to select the most appropriate tool for their needs. Fifteen different tools were compared: CADIMA, Covidence, DistillerSR, Endnote, Endnote using Bramer's method, EROS, HAWC, Microsoft Excel, Excel using VonVille's method, Microsoft Word, Rayyan, RevMan, SyRF, SysRev.com, and SWIFT Active Screener. Their support of 21 features was tested. Features were categorised as mandatory, desirable, and optional. DistillerSR, Covidence, and SWIFT Active Screener are the tools that support all mandatory features. These tools are preferred for screening references, but none of them are free. The best scoring free tool is Rayyan, which lacks one mandatory function: distinct title/abstract and full-text phases. The lowest scoring tools are those not specifically designed for SRs, like Microsoft Word and Endnote. Their use can only be advised for small and simple SRs. A well-informed selection of SR screening tools will benefit review quality and speed, which can contribute to the advancement of the 3Rs in animal studies.","Van der Mierden, Stevie; Tsaioun, Katya; Bleich, André; Leenaars, Cathalijn H C",ALTEX,227,31

At 100 ppm concentration and 2h contact period, over 5log reduction was observed against Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Salmonella enterica Serovar Typhimurium. Nanocomposite incorporated in medical gauze, topical formulation, and acrylic paint exhibit over 4log reduction against S. aureus. Bactericidal activity is governed by synergetic combination of electrostatic interaction of nanocomposite with bacterial cell envelope and simultaneous generation of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS).

This microalga immobilized in alginate beads was previously shown to be useful for the reduction of several chemical and microbial contaminants present in the highly polluted water from the Matanza-Riachuelo watershed. However, these beads had a relatively short shelf life in the natural environment. To overcome this limitation, a 3D-printed PLA device was designed. PLA is a biocompatible and biodegradable material suitable for biotechnological applications. We used Erlenmeyers and stirred-tank bioreactors fed batch with Murashige Skoog (MS) culture medium or water from the Cildáñez stream (one of the water bodies of the aforementioned watershed) to estimate the growth kinetics parameters and the bioremediation capacity of immobilized-microalgal cells as an unconfined system (UcS) or a confined system (CfS) inside PLA devices on Cildáñez water. Although alga's growth parameters were maximum in the UcS fed with MS medium as substrate, successful bioremediation of the target water was possible using the CfS: all inorganic nitrogen forms and total phosphorus were reduced at least by 90% after 5 days of bioprocess in an agitated bioreactor, whereas aerobic mesophilic bacteria decreased by about 85%. The number of coliforms also decreased. Standardized cytotoxicity tests using Allium cepa seeds carried out to prove the effectiveness of the bioremediation process, confirmed the high degree of decontamination achieved by the use of immobilized microalga confined in a 3D-printable PLA-device.","Marconi, Patricia Laura; Trentini, Andrea; Zawoznik, Myriam; Nadra, Carlos; Mercadé, Juan Manuel; Sánchez Novoa, Juan Gabriel; Orozco, Daniel; Groppa, María Daniela",AMB Express,227,1

Veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use in acute respiratory distress syndrome has increased. Occasionally, both are used. We hypothesized that methylprednisolone could improve lung compliance and ease weaning from extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all patients in our veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation unit treated with methylprednisolone over a 20 month period. Methylprednisolone was initiated for inability to wean off veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Dynamic compliance (Cdyn) was calculated at cannulation, methylprednisolone initiation, and decannulation. Demographics, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation-specific data, and ventilator data were collected. Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to test for differences in dynamic compliance. RESULTS A total of 12 veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients received methylprednisolone. Mean age was 50 (±15) years. Seven had influenza. Methylprednisolone was started on median Day 16 (interquartile range: 11-22) of veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. In total, 10 patients had veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation decannulation on median Day 12 (7-22) after methylprednisolone initiation. Two patients died before decannulation. The 10 decannulated patients had initial median dynamic compliance (mL × cm H2O-1) of 12 (7-23), then 16 (10-24) at methylprednisolone initiation, and then 44 (34-60) at decannulation. Dynamic compliance was higher at decannulation than methylprednisolone initiation (p = 0.002), and unchanged from cannulation to methylprednisolone initiation for all patients (p = 0.97). A total of 10 patients had significant infections. None had significant gastrointestinal bleed or wound healing issues. CONCLUSION Methylprednisolone may be associated with improved compliance in acute respiratory distress syndrome allowing for decannulation from veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. High rates of infection are associated with methylprednisolone use in veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Further studies are required to identify appropriate patient selection for methylprednisolone use in patients on veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.","Tabatabai, Ali; Menaker, Jay; Stene, Edward; Kufera, Joseph A; Rabinowitz, Ronald P; Kon, Zachary; Herr, Daniel L; Scalea, Thomas M",Perfusion,227,29

However, RCTs are costly and time-consuming to perform and long-term follow-up of participants may be hampered by lost contacts and financial constraints. Advances in computing and population-based registries have created new possibilities for increasing the value of RCTs by post-trial extension using linkage to routinely collected administrative/registry data in order to determine long-term interventional effects. There have been recent important examples, including 20+ years follow-up studies of trials of pravastatin and mammography. Despite the potential value of post-trial extension, there has been no systematic study of this literature. This scoping review aims to characterise published post-trial extension studies, assess their value, and identify any potential challenges associated with this approach. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This review will use the recommended methods for scoping reviews. We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. A draft search strategy is included in this protocol. Review of titles and abstracts, full texts of potentially eligible studies and data/information extraction will be conducted independently by pairs of investigators. Eligible studies will be RCTs that investigated healthcare interventions that were extended by individual linkage to administrative/registry/electronic medical records data after the completion of the planned follow-up period. Information concerning the original trial, characteristics of the extension study, any clinical, policy or ethical implications and methodological or practical challenges will be collected using standardised forms. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION As this study uses secondary data, and does not include person-level data, ethics approval is not required. We aim to disseminate these findings through journals and conferences targeting triallists and researchers involved in health data linkage. We aim to produce guidance for investigators on the conduct of post-trial extensions using routinely collected data.","Fitzpatrick, Tiffany; Perrier, Laure; Tricco, Andrea C; Straus, Sharon E; Jüni, Peter; Zwarenstein, Merrick; Lix, Lisa M; Smith, Mark; Rosella, Laura C; Henry, David A",BMJ open,227,1

We report a retrospective evaluation of the safety and efficacy of p64, a fully resheathable, detachable flow diverter, in the endovascular treatment of intracranial sidewall aneurysms. MATERIALS AND METHODS Results of 121 patients with 130 aneurysms (median neck size, 3 mm; median fundus size, 4 mm), treated from April 2012 through October 2014, were analyzed. Aneurysms were unruptured or beyond the acute SAH phase. Thirteen aneurysms were located in the posterior circulation. Twenty-three aneurysms had previous saccular treatment but no previous parent vessel stent placement. In 19 aneurysms, a combination of coiling and flow diversion was performed. RESULTS Successful p64 deployment was achieved in 127/130 aneurysms. The average number of p64s used was 1.1 per aneurysm. The rates of transient and permanent morbidity and mortality were 5%, 1.7%, and 0.8%, respectively. Three-month DSA follow-up in 123/130 aneurysms showed complete occlusion in 58.5%. Nine-month DSA follow-up in 93/106 (87.7%) eligible aneurysms showed complete occlusion in 79.6%. Late follow-up (median, 496 days) has already been performed in 35 aneurysms, showing complete occlusion in 30 (85.7%). CONCLUSIONS p64 offers an efficacious treatment option for intracranial sidewall aneurysms with a high aneurysm occlusion and an acceptable complication rate. The possibility of repositioning or removing the device was an advantage. The higher attenuation may lead to fewer devices per case and early aneurysm occlusion. Long-term follow-up data are pending.","Fischer, S; Aguilar-Pérez, M; Henkes, E; Kurre, W; Ganslandt, O; Bäzner, H; Henkes, H",AJNR. American journal of neuroradiology,227,31

We present a considerably large series for which we identify typical complications and pitfalls and provide evidence for the importance of an interdisciplinary algorithm for chronic wound healing complications and malignomas of the scalp and skull. We retrospectively reviewed all patients treated by the department of neurosurgery and cranio-maxillofacial surgery at our hospital for complex scalp deficiencies and malignant scalp tumors affecting the skull between 2006 and 2019, and extracted data on demographics, surgical technique, and perioperative complications. Thirty-seven patients were treated. Most cases were operated simultaneously (n: 32) and 6 cases in a staged procedure. Nineteen patients obtained a free flap for scalp reconstruction, 15 were treated with local axial flaps, and 3 patients underwent full thickness skin graft treatment. Complications occurred in 62% of cases, mostly related to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) circulation disorders. New cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) disturbances occurred in 8 patients undergoing free flaps and shunt dysfunction occurred in 5 patients undergoing local axial flaps. Four patients died shortly after the surgical procedure (perioperative mortality 10.8%). Combined scalp and skull deficiency present a challenging task. An interdisciplinary treatment helps to prevent severe and specialty-specific complications, such as hydrocephalus. We therefore recommend a close neurological observation after reconstructive treatment with focus on symptoms of CSF disturbances.","Butenschoen, Vicki M; Weitz, Jochen; Ritschl, Lucas M; Meyer, Bernhard; Krieg, Sandro M",Neurosurgical review,227,16

The multiparametric and large detailed information necessitates novel analyses to explore the insight of diseases and to aid the diagnosis, monitoring, and outcome prediction. Artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and deep learning (DL) provide various models of supervised, or unsupervised algorithms, and sophisticated neural networks to generate predictive models more precisely than conventional ones. The data, application tasks, and algorithms are three key components in AI. Various data formats are available in daily clinical practice of hepatology, including radiological imaging, EHR, liver pathology, data from wearable devices, and multi-omics measurements. The images of abdominal ultrasonography, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging can be used to predict liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and differentiation of benign tumors from hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Using EHR, the AI algorithms help predict the diagnosis and outcomes of liver cirrhosis, HCC, NAFLD, portal hypertension, varices, liver transplantation, and acute liver failure. AI helps to predict severity and patterns of fibrosis, steatosis, activity of NAFLD, and survival of HCC by using pathological data. Despite of these high potentials of AI application, data preparation, collection, quality, labeling, and sampling biases of data are major concerns.

A wide range of strategies have been used to help manage TD, and for those who are unable to have their antipsychotic medication stopped or substantially changed, the benzodiazepine group of drugs have been suggested as a useful adjunctive treatment. However, benzodiazepines are very addictive. OBJECTIVES To determine the effects of benzodiazepines for antipsychotic-induced tardive dyskinesia in people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or other chronic mental illnesses. SEARCH METHODS On 17 July 2015 and 26 April 2017, we searched the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Study-Based Register of Trials (including trial registers), inspected references of all identified studies for further trials and contacted authors of each included trial for additional information. SELECTION CRITERIA We included all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) focusing on people with schizophrenia (or other chronic mental illnesses) and antipsychotic-induced TD that compared benzodiazepines with placebo, no intervention, or any other intervention for the treatment of TD. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS We independently extracted data from the included studies and ensured that they were reliably selected, and quality assessed. For homogenous dichotomous data, we calculated random effects, risk ratio (RR), and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We synthesised continuous data from valid scales using mean differences (MD). For continuous outcomes, we preferred endpoint data to change data. We assumed that people who left early had no improvement. MAIN RESULTS The review now includes four trials (total 75 people, one additional trial since 2006, 21 people) randomising inpatients and outpatients in China and the USA. Risk of bias was mostly unclear as reporting was poor. We are uncertain about all the effects as all evidence was graded at very low quality. We found no significant difference between benzodiazepines and placebo for the outcome of 'no clinically important improvement in TD' (2 RCTs, 32 people, RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.60 to 2.09, very low quality evidence). Significantly fewer participants allocated to clonazepam compared with phenobarbital (as active placebo) experienced no clinically important improvement (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.96, 1 RCT, 21 people, very low quality evidence). For the outcome 'deterioration of TD symptoms,' we found no clear difference between benzodiazepines and placebo (2 RCTs, 30 people, RR 1.48, 95% CI 0.22 to 9.82, very low quality evidence). All 10 participants allocated to benzodiazepines experienced any adverse event compared with 7/11 allocated to phenobarbital (RR 1.53, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.41, 1 RCT, 21 people, very low quality evidence). There was no clear difference in the incidence of participants leaving the study early for benzodiazepines compared with placebo (3 RCTs, 56 people, RR 2.73, 95% CI 0.15 to 48.04, very low quality evidence) or compared with phenobarbital (as active placebo) (no events, 1 RCT, 21 people, very low quality evidence). No trials reported on social confidence, social inclusion, social networks, or personalised quality of life, which are outcomes designated important by patients. No trials comparing benzodiazepines with placebo or treatment as usual reported on adverse effects. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS There is only evidence of very low quality from a few small and poorly reported trials on the effect of benzodiazepines as an adjunctive treatment for antipsychotic-induced TD. These inconclusive results mean routine clinical use is not indicated and these treatments remain experimental. New and better trials are indicated in this under-researched area; however, as benzodiazepines are addictive, we feel that other techniques or medications should be adequately evaluated before benzodiazepines are chosen.","Bergman, Hanna; Bhoopathi, Paranthaman S; Soares-Weiser, Karla",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,227,24

We conducted a curriculum needs assessment followed by pre- and post-training surveys to evaluate MOUD pharmacology knowledge and best prescribing practices. Results: Of LCOM students surveyed, 77.6% reported interest in being waivered to prescribed MOUD for OUD treatment. Third-year medical students demonstrated increases in both MOUD Pharmacology Knowledge from 64.2% to 84.8% (chi-squared = 40.8; p < .001) and MOUD Best Prescribing Practices from 55.9% to 75.2% (chi-squared = 29.9; p < .001). Discussion: Surveys showed the majority of students felt waiver training was relevant to their future practice. An online DATA 2000 waiver training format effectively improved student knowledge of MOUD. Conclusion: This curriculum exposed medical students to DATA 2000 waiver training, MOUD pharmacology and best practices, and increased the number of future physicians eligible to treat OUD using MOUD.","Riser, Elly; Holterman, Leigh Ann; Maruti, Sanchit; Brooklyn, John R; DeVoe, Stephen G; Tompkins, Bradley J; Drouin, Jacqueline; Sobel, Halle G",Substance abuse,227,24

The aim of this study was to systematically review contemporary evidence to re-examine this relationship. METHODS A systematic review and meta-analysis was undertaken to examine the relationship between PCI procedural volume (both at hospital- and operator-levels) and outcomes in adults. The primary outcome was mortality. The secondary outcomes were complications, healthcare utilisation and process outcomes. Searches were conducted from 1 January 2008 to 28 May 2019. Certainty of the evidence was assessed using 'Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations' (GRADE). Screening, data extraction, quality appraisal and GRADE assessments were conducted independently by two reviewers. RESULTS Of 1,154 unique records retrieved, 22 observational studies with 6,432,265 patients were included. No significant association was found between total PCI hospital volume and mortality (odds ratio [OR]: 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.69-1.03, I 2 = 86%). A temporal trend from significant to non-significant pooled effect estimates was observed. The pooled effect estimate for mortality was found to be significantly in favour of high-volume operators for total PCI procedures (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.63-0.94, I 2 = 93%), and for high-volume hospitals for primary PCI procedures (OR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.62-0.94, I 2 = 78%). Overall, GRADE certainty of evidence was 'very low'. There were mixed findings for secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS A volume-outcome relationship may exist in certain situations, although this relationship appears to be attenuating with time, and there is 'very low' certainty of evidence. While volume might be important, it should not be the only standard used to define an acceptable PCI service and a broader evaluation of quality metrics should be considered that encompass patient experience and clinical outcomes.

Recurrence seems to be frequent after thermal therapy, such as radiofrequency ablation. OBJECTIVE To analyse long-term recurrence of neoplasia and BO after successful widespread endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR). DESIGN In a retrospective analysis, all patients undergoing widespread EMR of neoplastic BO between 2002 and 2007 at two referral centres were followed for at least 3 years after completion of endotherapy. Recurrence was diagnosed if neoplasia and/or BO were detected following previous successful complete removal, defined as at least two negative endoscopies and biopsies. RESULTS Ninety patients undergoing widespread EMR were included (mean age 63 years; 82 male), 58% of whom underwent additional thermal ablation for minor residual disease. Complete eradication of neoplasia and Barrett's tissue was achieved in 90% of patients. On further follow-up (mean 64.8 months), recurrence of neoplastic and non-neoplastic BO was found in 6.2% and 39.5%, respectively. Recurring neoplasia (3 adenocarcinomas, 1 low-grade and 1 high-grade dysplasia) were found after a median of 44 months (range 38-85) and could be retreated endoscopically. In a multivariate analysis, Barrett's length was the only factor significantly associated with recurrence (OR 2.73). CONCLUSIONS Even after seemingly complete endoscopic resection, recurrence of BO is frequent and independent of additional thermal therapy. Due to the possibility of neoplasia recurrence even after long disease-free intervals, follow-up should be extended beyond 5 years.","Anders, Mario; Bähr, Christina; El-Masry, Muhammad Abbas; Marx, Andreas H; Koch, Martin; Seewald, Stefan; Schachschal, Guido; Adler, Andreas; Soehendra, Nib; Izbicki, Jakob; Neuhaus, Peter; Pohl, Heiko; Rösch, Thomas",Gut,227,9

METHODS A congenic fragment containing Ncf1 along with congenic fragments containing the strongest remaining loci, Pia5/Cia3 and Pia7/Cia13 on chromosome 4, were transferred from the arthritis-susceptible DA strain into the background of the completely resistant E3 strain. The arthritis-regulatory potential of the transferred alleles was evaluated by comparing the susceptibility to experimental arthritis in congenic rats with that in E3 rats. The RT1(u) haplotype from the E3 strain was transferred into the susceptible DA strain (RT1(av1)), and various F(1) and F(2) hybrids were generated to assess the effects of RT1 on arthritis susceptibility. RESULTS The DA allele of Ncf1 did not break the arthritis resistance of the E3 rats, although it led to enhanced autoimmune B cell responses, as indicated by significantly elevated levels of anticollagen antibodies in congenic rats. Introgressing Pia5 and Pia7 loci on chromosome 4 broke the resistance to arthritis, and the MHC locus on chromosome 20 in DA rats enhanced arthritis when RT1 interacted with E3 genes. CONCLUSION The findings in these congenic lines confirm the existence of 3 major QTLs that regulate the severity of arthritis and are sufficient to induce the transformation of a completely arthritis-resistant rat strain into an arthritis-susceptible strain. This study also reveals a dramatic difference in the arthritis-regulatory potential of the rat MHC depending on genetic background, suggesting that strong epistatic interactions occur between MHC and non-MHC genes.","Rintisch, Carola; Förster, Michael; Holmdahl, Rikard",Arthritis and rheumatism,227,7

The aims of this study were to compare treatment outcomes between patients with PDF vs. PSD undergoing endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided drainage via transmural stents. Patients and methods Retrospective review of 142 consecutive patients with pseudocysts who underwent EUS-guided transmural drainage (TM) from 2008 to 2014 at 15 academic centers in the United States. Main outcome measures included TM technical success, treatment outcomes (symptomatic and radiologic resolution), need for endoscopic re-intervention at follow-up, and adverse events (AEs). Results TM was performed in 90 patients with PDF and 52 with PSD. Technical success: PDF 87 (96.7 %) vs. PSD 51 (98.1 %). There was no difference in the rates for endoscopic re-intervention (5.5 % in PDF vs. 11.5 % in PSD; P = 0.33) or AEs (12.2 % in PDF vs. 19.2 % in PSD; P = 0.33). Median long-term follow-up after stent removal was 297 days (interquartile range [IQR]: 59 - 424 days) for PDF and 326 days (IQR: 180 - 448 days) for PSD (P = 0.88). There was a higher rate of short-term radiologic resolution of PDF (45; 66.2 %) vs. PSD (21; 51.2 %) (OR = 0.30; 95 % CI: 0.13 - 0.72; P = 0.009). There was no difference in long-term symptomatic resolution (PDF: 70.4 % vs. PSD: 66.7 %; P = 0.72) or radiologic resolution (PDF: 68.9 % vs. PSD: 78.6 %; P = 0.72) Conclusions There was no difference in need for endoscopic re-intervention, AEs or long-term treatment outcomes in patients with PDF vs. PSD undergoing EUS-guided drainage with transmural stents. Based on these results, the presence of solid debris in pancreatic fluid collections does not appear to be associated with a poorer outcome.","Yang, Dennis; Amin, Sunil; Gonzalez, Susana; Mullady, Daniel; Edmundowicz, Steven A; DeWitt, John M; Khashab, Mouen A; Wang, Andrew Y; Nagula, Satish; Buscaglia, Jonathan M; Bucobo, Juan Carlos; Wagh, Mihir S; Draganov, Peter V; Stevens, Tyler; Vargo, John J; Khara, Harshit S; Diehl, David L; Keswani, Rajesh N; Komanduri, Srinadh; Yachimski, Patrick S; Prabhu, Anoop; Kwon, Richard S; Watson, Rabindra R; Goodman, Adam J; Benias, Petros; Carr-Locke, David L; DiMaio, Christopher J",Endoscopy international open,227,31

As with other chronic viruses, establishment of persistent infection requires that HCV-infected cells must be refractory to a range of pro-apoptotic stimuli. In response to oxidative stress, amplification of an outward K(+) current mediated by the Kv2.1 channel, precedes the onset of apoptosis. We show here that in human hepatoma cells either infected with HCV or harboring an HCV subgenomic replicon, oxidative stress failed to initiate apoptosis via Kv2.1. The HCV NS5A protein mediated this effect by inhibiting oxidative stress-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation of Kv2.1. The inhibition of a host cell K(+) channel by a viral protein is a hitherto undescribed viral anti-apoptotic mechanism and represents a potential target for antiviral therapy.","Mankouri, Jamel; Dallas, Mark L; Hughes, Mair E; Griffin, Stephen D C; Macdonald, Andrew; Peers, Chris; Harris, Mark",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,227,16

The effluent organic matters (EfOM) are well-known photosensitizers for the generation of reactive species, mainly including the triplet states of EfOM (3EfOM*), singlet oxygen (1O2) and hydroxyl radical (•OH), which contribute to the removal of trace pollutants in water. However, the effect of UV254 disinfection on the photoreactivity of EfOM remains unclear. Here we investigated the photophysical and photochemical properties variation of EfOM after UV254 disinfection, along with humic substances (HS) as comparison. The UV254 disinfection caused a decrease of aromaticity, fluorescence intensity and molecular weight for all samples, while a reduction formation of triplet state of these dissolved organic matters (3DOM*), 1O2, hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and superoxide anions (O2•-) under simulated sunlight was observed. In contrast, the generation of •OH was increased after UV254 disinfection. The quantum yield of 1O2 was positively correlated with triplet quantum yield coefficient (fTMP) in all cases. However, the quantum yield of •OH exhibited positive and negative correlations with fTMP for EfOM and HS, respectively. The quantum yields showed positive correlations with E2/E3 (ratio of the absorbance at 254 to 365 nm) for untreated DOM samples, while for the first time we found the trends differ distinctly after UV254 disinfection. These findings indicate that UV254 disinfection in WWTPs significantly increases the potential of •OH photoproduction from effluents and the cost-effective solar irradiation after UV254 disinfection is expected to be a novel technique for further removal of pathogen and trace organic pollutants in wastewater effluents and receiving waters.","Wan, Dong; Kong, Yaqian; Selvinsimpson, Steplinpaulselvin; Luo, Fan; Chen, Yong",Water research,227,0

Tapes cannot be cleaned or disinfected; yet, several clinicians may use a given roll for any number of patients. Reports of tape contamination associated with clinical infection have been published. PURPOSE We reviewed the literature reporting microbiological studies, case reports of infections, and nosocomial outbreaks associated with the use of medical tapes and other adhesive devices to assess the prevalence of this problem. METHODS We conducted a literature search for cross-contamination due to medical tape use in 6 databases in June 2020 using indexing terms for surgical tape, adhesive agent, adhesives or the keyword for tape. We compiled available evidence on tape contamination as a cause for healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). MAIN FINDINGS Forty-two publications reported relevant microbiological studies, case reports of infections, and/or nosocomial outbreaks. Results demonstrated that tape rolls handled with questionable practices can harbor pathogens. Some studies showed the association between contaminated tape and HAIs, which in some cases even led to death. CONCLUSIONS The time has come to establish national guidelines to help reduce the risk of cross-contamination from medical tapes. We offer suggested elements for these guidelines. The COVID-19 pandemic brings greater scrutiny to eliminate any avoidable cause of infection transmission.","Bernatchez, Stéphanie F; Schommer, Kimberly",American journal of infection control,227,31

Several studies have identified both barriers and facilitating factors that influence primary care physicians' (PCPs) use of advanced EMR features and the maturation of their EMR use. The purpose of this study is to explore and identify the factors that impact PCPs' mature use of EMRs. METHODS A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Cochrane Handbook. The MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO electronic databases were searched from 1946 to June 13, 2019. Two independent reviewers screened the studies for eligibility; to be included, studies had to address factors influencing PCPs' mature use of EMRs. A narrative synthesis was conducted to collate study findings and to report on patterns identified across studies. The quality of the studies was also appraised. RESULTS Of the 1893 studies identified, 14 were included in this study. Reported factors that influenced PCPs' mature use of EMRs fell into one of the following 5 categories: technology, people, organization, resources, and policy. Concerns about the EMR system's functionality, lack of physician awareness of EMR functionality, limited physician availability to learn more about EMRs, the habitual use of successfully completing clinical tasks using only basic EMR features, business-oriented organizational objectives, lack of vendor training, limited resource availability, and lack of physician readiness were reported as barriers to PCPs' mature use of EMRs. The motivation of physicians, user satisfaction, coaching and peer mentoring, EMR experience, gender, physician perception, transition planning for changes in roles and work processes, team-based care, adequate technical support and training, sharing resources, practices affiliated with an integrated delivery system, financial incentives, and policies to increase EMR use all had a favorable impact on PCPs' use of advanced EMR features. CONCLUSIONS By using a narrative synthesis to synthesize the evidence, we identified interrelated factors influencing the mature use of EMRs by PCPs. The findings underline the need to provide adequate training and policies that facilitate the mature use of EMRs by PCPs.

Their tissue and cellular complexity ensure lung function and protection from external agents, for example, virus. Two-dimensional (2D) in vitro systems and animal models have been largely employed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying human lung development, physiology, and pathogenesis. However, neither of these models accurately recapitulate the human lung environment and cellular crosstalk. More recently, human-derived three-dimensional (3D) models have been generated allowing for a deeper understanding of cell-to-cell communication. However, the availability and accessibility of primary human cell sources from which generate the 2D and 3D models may be limited.

Analyses of observational studies often do not account for patients' clinical condition at the time of corticosteroid therapy initiation. OBJECTIVES To investigate the association of corticosteroid therapy on mortality and on MERS coronavirus RNA clearance in critically ill patients with MERS. METHODS ICU patients with MERs were included from 14 Saudi Arabian centers between September 2012 and October 2015. We performed marginal structural modeling to account for baseline and time-varying confounders. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Of 309 patients, 151 received corticosteroids. Corticosteroids were initiated at a median of 3.0 days (quartile 1 [Q1]-Q3, 1.0-7.0) from ICU admission. Patients who received corticosteroids were more likely to receive invasive ventilation (141 of 151 [93.4%] vs. 121 of 158 [76.6%]; P < 0.0001) and had higher 90-day crude mortality (112 of 151 [74.2%] vs. 91 of 158 [57.6%]; P = 0.002). Using marginal structural modeling, corticosteroid therapy was not significantly associated with 90-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio, 0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.52-1.07; P = 0.12) but was associated with delay in MERS coronavirus RNA clearance (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.17-0.72; P = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS Corticosteroid therapy in patients with MERS was not associated with a difference in mortality after adjustment for time-varying confounders but was associated with delayed MERS coronavirus RNA clearance. These findings highlight the challenges and importance of adjusting for baseline and time-varying confounders when estimating clinical effects of treatments using observational studies.","Arabi, Yaseen M; Mandourah, Yasser; Al-Hameed, Fahad; Sindi, Anees A; Almekhlafi, Ghaleb A; Hussein, Mohamed A; Jose, Jesna; Pinto, Ruxandra; Al-Omari, Awad; Kharaba, Ayman; Almotairi, Abdullah; Al Khatib, Kasim; Alraddadi, Basem; Shalhoub, Sarah; Abdulmomen, Ahmed; Qushmaq, Ismael; Mady, Ahmed; Solaiman, Othman; Al-Aithan, Abdulsalam M; Al-Raddadi, Rajaa; Ragab, Ahmed; Balkhy, Hanan H; Al Harthy, Abdulrahman; Deeb, Ahmad M; Al Mutairi, Hanan; Al-Dawood, Abdulaziz; Merson, Laura; Hayden, Frederick G; Fowler, Robert A",American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,227,17

Our aim is to report our current experience. PATIENTS AND METHODS Observational cohort study of the first 32 patients who underwent minimally invasive esophagectomy for esophageal cancer from September 2011 to June 2014. The gastric tube was created laparoscopically. In the thoracic field, a robot-assisted thoracoscopic approach was performed in the prone position with intrathoracic robotic hand-sewn anastomosis. Patient and tumour characteristics, surgical technique, short-term outcomes (morbidity and mortality) and oncological results (radicality and number of removed nodes) were evaluated. RESULTS Thirty-two patients, with a mean age of 58 years (34-74) were treated by a totally minimally invasive esophagectomy: robotic laparoscopy and thoracoscopy (11 McKeown and 21 Ivor-Lewis). Twenty-nine received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. There were no conversions to open surgery. Console time was 218minutes (190-285). Blood loss was 170ml (40-255). One patient died from cardiac disease. Nine patients had a major complication (Dindo-Clavien grade II or higher). There was no case of respiratory complication or recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. Five patients had intrathoracic fistula, 4 radiological and one clinical. Three had chylothorax, 2 cervical fistula and one gastric tube necrosis. The median hospital stay was 12 days (8-50). All the resections were R0 and the median of removed lymph nodes was 16 (2-23).

The feasibility of the slip-knot clip suturing method was evaluated in this clinical pilot study. METHODS Ten patients underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection for colorectal and duodenal tumors 5 cm or less. A slip-knot loop can be tightened when tension is applied to the free end of the string. A clip and string can be passed through an instrument channel (3.2 mm) of a single-channel endoscope. The slip-knot loop is anchored onto the mucosal defect's proximal margin with the clip. Additional clips anchoring the slip-knot loop are placed at the opposite side of the margin. The slip-knot loop is tightened by pulling the string. Additional clips are placed to achieve complete closure. RESULTS The mean size of resected specimen was 34.4 ± 10.0 mm. The success rate of the slip-knot clip suturing method was 90% (9/10). In the first patient, the string was cut because of friction, and the patient dropped out of the study. After the failure of the first patient, we used wet string to reduce friction, and slip-knot string worked effectively. The mean procedure time was 18.2 ± 3.3 minutes.

To better understand this functional interplay, we used Biotin Identification in human embryonic kidney cells to identify proximity interaction partners for GATA3, TCF7 (TCF1), SPI1, HLF, IKZF1, PAX5, ID1, and ID2. The proximity interaction partners shared among the lineage-restricted transcription factors included ARID1a, a BRG1-associated factor complex component. CUT&RUN analysis revealed that ARID1a shared binding with TCF7 and GATA3 at a substantial number of putative regulatory elements in mouse T cell progenitors. In support of an important function for ARID1a in lymphocyte development, deletion of Arid1a in early lymphoid progenitors in mice resulted in a pronounced developmental arrest in early T cell development with a reduction of CD4+CD8+ cells and a 20-fold reduction in thymic cellularity. Exploring gene expression patterns in DN3 cells from Wt and Arid1a-deficient mice suggested that the developmental block resided in the DN3a to DN3b transition, indicating a deficiency in β-selection. Our work highlights the critical importance of functional interactions between stage and lineage-restricted factors and the basic transcription machinery during lymphocyte differentiation.","Astori, Audrey; Tingvall-Gustafsson, Johanna; Kuruvilla, Jacob; Coyaud, Etienne; Laurent, Estelle M N; Sunnerhagen, Maria; Åhsberg, Josefine; Ungerbäck, Jonas; Strid, Tobias; Sigvardsson, Mikael; Raught, Brian; Somasundaram, Rajesh",Journal of immunology,227,31

We conducted a scoping review of available literature on COVID-19 to assess the potential impact on neurologists in terms of prevalent comorbidities and incidence of new neurologic events in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS We searched Medline/PubMed, CINAHL (EBSCO), and SCOPUS databases for adult patients with preexisting neurologic disease that were diagnosed and hospitalized for COVID-19, or reported incidence of secondary neurologic events following diagnosis of COVID-19. Pooled descriptive statistics of clinical data and comorbidities were examined. RESULTS Among screened articles, 322 of 4,014 (8.0%) of hospitalized patients diagnosed and treated for COVID-19 had a preexisting neurologic illness. Four retrospective studies demonstrated an increased risk of secondary neurologic complications in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 (incidence of 6%, 20% and 36.4%, respectively). Inconsistent reporting and limited statistical analysis among these studies did not allow for assessment of comparative outcomes. CONCLUSION Emerging literature suggests a daunting clinical relationship between COVID-19 and neurologic illness. Neurologists need to be prepared to reorganize their consultative practices to serve the neurologic needs of patients during this pandemic.","Herman, Collin; Mayer, Kirby; Sarwal, Aarti",Neurology,227,1

Oxycodone HCl-niacin tablets combine oxycodone HCl with niacin and functional inactive excipients to create potential barriers to oral, intranasal, and intravenous abuse. This study compared the relative abuse potential of oral immediate-release oxycodone HCl-niacin with that of oral immediate-release oxycodone HCl and placebo in nondependent, recreational opioid users. METHODS Forty-nine participants received oxycodone HCl-niacin 40/240 mg and 80/480 mg, oxycodone 40 mg and 80 mg, and placebo in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled and active-controlled, five-way crossover study. Primary endpoints based on a bipolar 100 mm visual analog scale for drug liking were area under effect curve (AUE0-1h, AUE0-2h, AUE0-3h), peak disliking, and effect at 0.5 hours post-dose (E0.5h). Other endpoints included take drug again assessment, overall drug liking, and pupillometry. RESULTS There were statistically significant differences between oxycodone HCl-niacin and oxycodone HCl doses for all primary endpoints (P < 0.0001, all comparisons), suggesting reduced abuse potential with oxycodone HCl-niacin. Take drug again and overall drug liking showed greater liking of oxycodone alone. Oxycodone HCl-niacin 80/480 mg had consistently lower liking assessments than oxycodone HCl-niacin 40/240 mg, suggesting a dose-response to the aversive effects of niacin. Opioid-related adverse events were similar for equivalent oxycodone doses. The treatment-emergent adverse events most specifically associated with oxycodone HCl-niacin (ie, skin-burning sensation, warmth, and flushing) were consistent with the expected vasocutaneous effects of niacin. No serious adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION Oxycodone HCl-niacin tablets may, in a dose-dependent manner, decrease the potential for oral abuse of oxycodone without unexpected adverse events or clinically signifi-cant differences in safety parameters compared with oxycodone alone. Although statistically powered, the small size of the study sample and the characteristics of its participants may not be generalizable to the population that abuses prescription opioid medications.","Webster, Lynn R; Rolleri, Robert L; Pixton, Glenn C; Sommerville, Kenneth W",Substance abuse and rehabilitation,227,1

The success of such ""reactive"" strategies is influenced by the fraction of transmission occurring before signs appear. We performed experimental studies of foot-and-mouth disease transmission in cattle and estimated this fraction at less than half the value expected from detecting virus in body fluids, the standard proxy measure of infectiousness. This is because the infectious period is shorter (mean 1.7 days) than currently realized, and animals are not infectious until, on average, 0.5 days after clinical signs appear. These results imply that controversial preemptive control measures may be unnecessary; instead, efforts should be directed at early detection of infection and rapid intervention.","Charleston, Bryan; Bankowski, Bartlomies M; Gubbins, Simon; Chase-Topping, Margo E; Schley, David; Howey, Richard; Barnett, Paul V; Gibson, Debi; Juleff, Nicholas D; Woolhouse, Mark E J",Science,227,27

Deterioration of physical function is accelerated in patients with CKD to levels that significantly impact on clinically and patient-important outcomes such as morbidity, employment, quality of life and, ultimately, survival. However, meaningful interpretation of the existing physical function-related literature in adult patients with CKD is hindered, possibly due to inconsistent choice of methodology, assessment tools and reporting of data. The current comprehensive review of the literature aims to provide the theoretical rationale and framework for physical function assessment and to identify the prevailing approaches to (i) the characterization (classification and terminology), (ii) interpretation, and (iii) reporting of physical function assessment in people with CKD. Comprehensive assessment of physical function can provide important information about the presence of 'physiological impairment' at a body systems level (exercise tolerance under well controlled, laboratory-based procedures), 'functional limitations' (physical performance during tasks imitating usual daily, personal or occupational tasks) and 'functional disability' (via self-reported physical functioning in the context of a socio-cultural environment). The selection of physical function assessment tools should be guided by the primary purpose of the assessment (e.g. research or routine clinical monitoring), by the overall scientific 'soundness' of the chosen tool (e.g. validity, utility, reproducibility, responsiveness characteristics) and by operational factors (e.g. patient collaboration, cost, personnel expertise). Recommendations for tests, methods and protocols are therefore presented, for the assessment of cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness, physical performance and self-reported physical functioning. These recommendations are based on synthesis of available information as derived from controlled exercise training interventions in adult patients with CKD. Special considerations for physical function assessment and suggestions for future research are also addressed. Such an information synthesis might promote greater standardization of the physical function assessment of patients with CKD in routine clinical care or research settings. This would potentially lead to generation of adequate scientific decision-making criteria to help researchers and healthcare providers in selecting the most appropriate measures according to the physical function areas assessed, and to accurately and meaningfully characterize and compare patients' responses to therapeutic interventions.","Koufaki, Pelagia; Kouidi, Evangelia",Sports medicine,227,1

METHODS This IRB-approved retrospective study included 118 patients with 150 lesions (93 (62%) HCC and 57 (38%) non-HCC) pathologically confirmed through biopsies (n = 72), resections (n = 29), liver transplants (n = 46), and autopsies (n = 3). Forty-seven percent of HCC lesions showed atypical imaging features (not meeting Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System [LI-RADS] criteria for definitive HCC/LR5). A 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained on 140 lesions and tested for its ability to classify the 10 remaining lesions (5 HCC/5 non-HCC). Performance of the model was averaged over 150 runs with random sub-sampling to provide class-balanced test sets. A lesion grading system was developed to demonstrate the similarity between atypical HCC and non-HCC lesions prone to misclassification by the CNN. RESULTS The CNN demonstrated an overall accuracy of 87.3%. Sensitivities/specificities for HCC and non-HCC lesions were 92.7%/82.0% and 82.0%/92.7%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.912. CNN's performance was correlated with the lesion grading system, becoming less accurate the more atypical imaging features the lesions showed. CONCLUSION This study provides proof-of-concept for CNN-based classification of both typical- and atypical-appearing HCC lesions on multi-phasic MRI, utilizing pathologically confirmed lesions as ""ground truth."" KEY POINTS • A CNN trained on atypical appearing pathologically proven HCC lesions not meeting LI-RADS criteria for definitive HCC (LR5) can correctly differentiate HCC lesions from other liver malignancies, potentially expanding the role of image-based diagnosis in primary liver cancer with atypical features. • The trained CNN demonstrated an overall accuracy of 87.3% and a computational time of < 3 ms which paves the way for clinical application as a decision support instrument.","Oestmann, Paula M; Wang, Clinton J; Savic, Lynn J; Hamm, Charlie A; Stark, Sophie; Schobert, Isabel; Gebauer, Bernhard; Schlachter, Todd; Lin, MingDe; Weinreb, Jeffrey C; Batra, Ramesh; Mulligan, David; Zhang, Xuchen; Duncan, James S; Chapiro, Julius",European radiology,227,19

The aim of this translational study is to evaluate tolerance and long-term MRI visibility of two recently developed Gadolinium-modified meshes in a rat animal model. MATERIALS AND METHODS Gadolinium-poly-ε-caprolactone (Gd-PCL) and Gadolinium-polymethylacrylate (Gd-PMA) modified meshes were implanted in Wistar rats and their tolerance was assessed daily. Inflammation and biocompatibility of the implants were assessed by histology and immunohistochemistry after 30 days post implantation. Implants were visualised by 7T and 3T MRI at day 30 and at day 90. Diffusion of Gadolinium in the tissues of the implanted animals was assessed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. RESULTS Overall Gd-PMA coated implants were better tolerated as compared to those coated with Gd-PCL. In fact, Gd-PMA implants were characterised by a high ratio collagen I/III and good vascularisation of the integration tissues. High resolution images of the coated mesh were obtained in vivo with experimental 7T as well as 3T clinical MRI. Mass spectrometry analyses showed that levels of Gadolinium in animals implanted with coated mesh were similar to those of the control group. CONCLUSIONS Meshes coated with Gd-PMA are better tolerated as compared to those coated with Gd-PCL as no signs of erosion or significant inflammation were detected at 30 days post implantation. Also, Gd-PMA coated meshes were clearly visualised with both 7T and 3T MRI devices. This new technique of mesh optimisation may represent a valuable tool in soft tissue repair and management.","Letouzey, Vincent; Huberlant, Stéphanie; Cornille, Arnaud; Blanquer, Sébastien; Guillaume, Olivier; Lemaire, Laurent; Garric, Xavier; de Tayrac, Renaud",PloS one,227,1

Long-term exposure to the PD solution creates functional and morphological alterations, and these alterations diminish the efficacy of PD. It is important to establish an evaluation of the changes in PD patients and strategies for the prevention of PD damage and encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS). We determined the relationship between clinical findings and macroscopic morphological findings by laparoscopy in patients receiving PD. Macroscopic intraperitoneal findings were recorded at the PD catheter removal in 23 PD patients. We examined macroscopic morphological findings such as fibrin deposition, peritoneal turbidity, vasculopathy, adhesion and calcification in both parietal and visceral peritoneum of upper and lower peritoneal cavities, and assessed the score semi-quantitatively. We then evaluated the relationship between the morphological score and clinical findings, especially observational parts and findings in EPS patients. The total macroscopic score increased with PD duration. Peritoneal turbidity, fibrin deposition, and calcification were observed in the whole peritoneal cavity. Scores of fibrin deposition, turbidity, and calcification increased with PD duration. Vasculopathy in the parietal peritoneum was more serious compared with that in the visceral peritoneum, but there was no difference in the vasculopathy between the upper and lower areas. A characteristic of the macroscopic findings in EPS patients was peritoneal calcification in this study. It appears that macroscopic findings using laparoscopy is significant in evaluating the degree of the peritoneum damage and predicting EPS development.","Hamada, Chieko; Nakamoto, Hirotaka; Suzuki, Yusuke",Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for Artificial Organs,227,26

Ongoing research in the fields of prevention, management, and therapy establishes a functional scaffold for clinics during the time of crisis. To obtain this goal, it is necessary that all pathophysiologic aspects of COVID-19 from infection to predisposing backgrounds of infection be identified, so that all the ambiguities of researchers regarding transmission mechanisms, variable clinical manifestation, and therapeutic response can be solved. Here, we firstly discuss about the homology screening between nCoV-2019 and beta-coronavirus family using phylogenetic analyses. Secondly, we analyzed the viral motifs to show that viral entry into the host cells requires a primary activation step performed by FURIN and FURIN-like-mediated enzymatic cleavage on the structural glycoprotein. The cleavage increases viral performance by 1000 folds. We then present a comprehensive view on host cells and the significance of gene variants affecting activation enzymes, supportive entry, and spread mechanisms in humans including renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) a pathway results in certain phenotypes or exacerbate infection-related phenotypes in different organs, hence causes variable clinical manifestations.

Since isolated systems are exceptionally rare to find in any context, especially in human contact networks, here we examine the susceptible-infected-recovered model of disease spreading in a multiplex network formed by two distinct networks or layers, interconnected through a fraction q of shared individuals (overlap). We model the interactions through weighted networks, because person-to-person interactions are diverse (or disordered); weights represent the contact times of the interactions. Using branching theory supported by simulations, we analyze a social distancing strategy that reduces the average contact time in both layers, where the intensity of the distancing is related to the topology of the layers. We find that the critical values of the distancing intensities, above which an epidemic can be prevented, increase with the overlap q. Also we study the effect of the social distancing on the mutual giant component of susceptible individuals, which is crucial to keep the functionality of the system. In addition, we find that for relatively small values of the overlap q, social distancing policies might not be needed at all to maintain the functionality of the system.","Perez, Ignacio A; Di Muro, Matías A; La Rocca, Cristian E; Braunstein, Lidia A",Physical review.

Most notable is severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a lower respiratory tract disease of humans that was first reported in late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China. The disease, which quickly spread worldwide over a period of 4 months spanning late 2002 and early 2003, infected over 8,000 individuals and killed nearly 800 before it was successfully contained by aggressive public health intervention strategies. A coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as the etiological agent of SARS, and initial assessments determined that the virus crossed to human hosts from zoonotic reservoirs, including bats, Himalayan palm civets (Paguma larvata), and raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), sold in exotic animal markets in Guangdong Province. In this review, we discuss the molecular mechanisms that govern coronavirus cross-species transmission both in vitro and in vivo, using the emergence of SARS-CoV as a model.

METHODS The PTSD Checklist-Civilian and the Perceived Stress Scale were administered from 11 to 18 March 2020, to 90 nurses selected from another city to go and help an intensive care unit (ICU) in Wuhan, China. These nurses were selected because of their high levels of clinical performance and resilience status. RESULTS Nurses' average PTSD score was 24.62 ± 6.68, and five (5.6%) of the nurses reported a clinically significant level of PTSD symptoms (>38 points). Nurses' perceived stress averaged 19.33 ± 7, and 20 nurses (22.22%) scored positively >25 points. Nurses' stress and PTSD symptoms were positively correlated (P < .01). Major stress sources included working in an isolated environment, concerns about personal protective equipment shortage and usage, physical and emotional exhaustion, intensive workload, fear of being infected, and insufficient work experiences with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS This study showed that even relatively highly resilient nurses experienced some degree of mental distress, including PTSD symptoms and perceived stress. Our findings highlight the importance of helping nurses cultivate resilience and reduce stress. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Recommendations for practice include providing adequate training and orientation before assigning nurses to ICU to help, offering disaster-emergency-preparedness training to keep nurses prepared, providing caring and authentic nursing leadership, offering ongoing psychological support to frontline nurses.","Leng, Min; Wei, Lili; Shi, Xiaohui; Cao, Guorong; Wei, Yuling; Xu, Hong; Zhang, Xiaoying; Zhang, Wenwen; Xing, Shuyun; Wei, Holly",Nursing in critical care,227,1

The 75-year-old patient suffering from oncologic disease had a planned a F18-fluoro-deoxy-glucose positron-emission tomography/computer tomography scan with a routine oncological indication where incidental radiomorphologic findings of pneumonia suspect for COVID-19 were detected. After immediate isolation, the patient was transferred to the corresponding medical department, where further investigations verified the diagnosis of COVID-19. With this case, our aim is to raise the awareness for the importance of the instant evaluation of chest computer tomography series when performing planned imaging examination, especially in frail patients.

Circ-KIAA0907 has been found to play an anti-cancer role in OSCC, so it is worth exploring more functions and new mechanisms of circ-KIAA0907 in OSCC progression. METHODS Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of circ-KIAA0907, microRNA (miR)-96-5p, and unc-13 homolog C (UNC13C). Transwell assay, flow cytometry, and colony formation assay were employed to measure the migration, invasion, apoptosis, and radiosensitivity of cells. Besides, glucose uptake, lactate production, and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) were determined to evaluate the glycolysis ability of cells. Dual-luciferase reporter assay and RIP assay were performed to confirm the interactions among circ-KIAA0907, miR-96-5p, and UNC13C. And RNA pull-down assay was used to verify the binding degree of miR-96-5p to its targets. Moreover, UNC13C protein level was examined using western blot (WB) analysis. OSCC xenograft models were constructed to perform in vivo experiments. RESULTS Circ-KIAA0907 was a stability circRNA with lowly expression in OSCC. Overexpressed circ-KIAA0907 could inhibit migration, invasion, and glycolysis, while promoting apoptosis and radiosensitivity in OSCC cells. In the terms of mechanism, circ-KIAA0907 could sponge miR-96-5p to regulate UNC13C expression. MiR-96-5p overexpression could reverse the inhibitory effect of circ-KIAA0907 on OSCC progression, and UNC13C knockdown also could overturn the suppressive effect of miR-96-5p inhibitor on OSCC progression. Animal experiments revealed that circ-KIAA0907 could reduce the tumor growth of OSCC by regulating the miR-96-5p/UNC13C axis. CONCLUSION Our study suggests that circ-KIAA0907 restrains OSCC progression via the miR-96-5p/UNC13C axis, indicating that it may be a potential target for OSCC treatment.","Dong, Wenjie; Zhao, Lei; Zhang, Shiyang; Zhang, Shijie; Si, Hongyun",World journal of surgical oncology,227,16

Monitoring trends in HIV-related care outcomes is needed to inform programs aimed at reducing new HIV infections in the United States. SETTING The setting is 33 United States jurisdictions that as of December 2019 had complete laboratory reporting for specimens through September 2019. METHODS Estimated annual percent change (EAPC) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess trends in stage of disease at time of diagnosis, linkage to HIV medical care within 1 month after HIV diagnosis, and viral suppression within 6 months after HIV diagnosis. Differences in percentages were analyzed by gender, age, race/ethnicity, and transmission category for persons with HIV diagnosed from 2014-2018. RESULTS Among 133,477 persons with HIV diagnosed during 2014-2018, the percentage of persons that received a diagnosis classified as stage 0 increased 13.7% , stages 1-2 (early infections) increased 2.9%, stage 3 (AIDS) declined 1.5%, linkage to HIV medical care within 1 month after HIV diagnosis increased 2.3%, and viral suppression within 6 months after HIV diagnosis increased 6.5% per year, on average. Subpopulations and areas that showed the least progress were persons aged 45-54 years, American Indian/Alaska Native persons, Asian persons, Native Hawaiian/other Pacific Islander persons, and rural areas with substantial HIV prevalence. CONCLUSIONS New infections will continue to occur unless improvements are made in implementing the EHE strategies of diagnosing, treating, and preventing HIV infection.","Dailey, André; Johnson, Anna Satcher; Hu, Xiaohong; Gant, Zanetta; Lyons, Shacara Johnson; Adih, William",Journal of acquired immune deficiency syndromes,227,1

The pregnant population is also another concern for health care professionals. There are physiological changes related to pregnancy that result in different laboratory levels, radiological findings and disease progression. The goal of the present article is to determine whether the laboratory results and radiological findings were different in non-pregnant women (NPWs) of reproductive age and pregnant women (PWs) diagnosed with the Covid-19 infection. METHODS Out of 34 patients, 15 (44.11%) PWs and 19 (55.8%) NPWs were included in the study. Age, comorbidities, complaints, vitals, respiratory rates, computed tomography (CT) findings and stages, as well as laboratory parameters, were recorded from the hospital database. RESULTS The mean age of the PWs was of 27.6 ± 0.99 years, and that of the NPWs was of 37.63 ± 2.00; when age was compared between the groups, a statistically significant difference (p = 0.001) was found. The mean systolic blood pressure of the PWs was of 116.53 ± 11.35, and that of the NPWs was of 125.53 ± 13.00, and their difference was statistically significant (p = 0.05). The difference in the minimum respiratory rates of the patients was also statistically significant (p = 0.05). The platelet levels observed among the PWs with Covid-19 were lower than those of the NPWs (185.40 ± 39.09 × 109/mcL and 232.00 ± 71.04 × 109/mcL respectively; p = 0.05). The mean D-dimer value of the PWs was lower in comparison to that of the NPWs (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION The laboratory findings and imaging studies may differ between pregnant and non-pregnant populations. It is important to properly interpret these studies. Future studies with a higher number of patients are required to confirm these preliminary data.","Ozer, Kadir Burak; Sakin, Onder; Koyuncu, Kazibe; Cimenoglu, Berk; Demirhan, Recep",Revista brasileira de ginecologia e obstetricia : revista da Federacao Brasileira das Sociedades de Ginecologia e Obstetricia,227,19

METHODS We analyzed retrospectively 78 patients with acne scars who presented to the Department of Plastic Surgery at Peking Union Medical College Hospital from May 2015 to May 2017; 30 patients were treated with dermabrasion (Group 1), and the other 48 patients were treated with ReCell® autologous regeneration techniques combined with dermabrasion (Group 2). Efficacy was evaluated through self-evaluation of the patient, third-party evaluation and photographs taken before and after treatment. The wound healing time and postoperative complication rate were also recorded. RESULTS The study revealed a significant difference in healing time (P < 0.001) between patients treated with dermabrasion (Group 1) and patients treated with ReCell® autologous regeneration techniques combined with dermabrasion (Group 2). The average healing time of Group 1 was 12.30 ± 1.725 days, while the average healing time of Group 2 was 5.27 ± 1.086 days. In Group 2, patient self-evaluation and third-party evaluation were more satisfactory than those of Group 1 (P < 0.001). Moreover, there were no postoperative complications in Group 2 such as pigmentation and scar hyperplasia. CONCLUSION The ReCell® technique is simple, minimally invasive, biocompatible and effective in the treatment of acne scars. It can shorten healing time and reduce the occurrence of postoperative complications, thereby providing a safe and effective treatment approach for patients with facial acne scars.

The utility of aortic MRE would be improved if it could provide information about local variations in aortic stiffness. We hypothesize that regional variations in aortic stiffness can also be measured with MRE and the purpose of this work was to demonstrate that MRE can measure regional stiffness variations in a vascular phantom and in ex vivo porcine aortas. A vascular phantom was fabricated, containing two silicone tubes embedded in gel. A segment of one of the tubes was modified to increase its stiffness. MRE was performed on the phantom with a continuous flow of water through the tubes. The stiffness distribution along the modified tube was measured and compared to the reference tube. MRE was also performed in porcine aortas embedded in gel with segments treated with saline or formalin for 4 days. The stiffness difference between saline- and formalin-treated aortic segments was measured by MRE and mechanical tests. A positive correlation was found between the regional stiffnesses measured by MRE and mechanical tests. The results indicate that MRE can be used to evaluate the local stiffness distribution in silicone tubes and ex vivo porcine aortas. It may therefore be possible to apply MRE to measure regional stiffness variations of the aorta in vivo.","Zhang, Nan; Chen, Jun; Yin, Meng; Glaser, Kevin J; Xu, Lei; Ehman, Richard L",Magnetic resonance imaging,227,27

The nonstructural protein (nsP) precursor polyprotein is translated from genomic RNA and processed into four nsPs. nsP3 has a highly conserved macrodomain (MD) that binds ADP-ribose (ADPr), which can be conjugated to protein as a posttranslational modification involving transfer of ADPr from NAD+ by poly ADPr polymerases (PARPs). The nsP3MD also removes ADPr from mono ADP-ribosylated (MARylated) substrates. To determine which aspects of alphavirus replication require nsP3MD ADPr-binding and/or hydrolysis function, we studied NSC34 neuronal cells infected with chikungunya virus (CHIKV). Infection induced ADP-ribosylation of cellular proteins without increasing PARP expression, and inhibition of MARylation decreased virus replication. CHIKV with a G32S mutation that reduced ADPr-binding and hydrolase activities was less efficient than WT CHIKV in establishing infection and in producing nsPs, dsRNA, viral RNA, and infectious virus. CHIKV with a Y114A mutation that increased ADPr binding but reduced hydrolase activity, established infection like WT CHIKV, rapidly induced nsP translation, and shut off host protein synthesis with reduced amplification of dsRNA. To assess replicase function independent of virus infection, a transreplicase system was used. Mutant nsP3MDs D10A, G32E, and G112E with no binding or hydrolase activity had no replicase activity, G32S had little, and Y114A was intermediate to WT. Therefore, ADP ribosylation of proteins and nsP3MD ADPr binding are necessary for initiation of alphavirus replication, while hydrolase activity facilitates amplification of replication complexes. These observations are consistent with observed nsP3MD conservation and limited tolerance for mutation.","Abraham, Rachy; Hauer, Debra; McPherson, Robert Lyle; Utt, Age; Kirby, Ilsa T; Cohen, Michael S; Merits, Andres; Leung, Anthony K L; Griffin, Diane E",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,227,1

In 2019, approximately 86% of Internet users reported engaging in at least one SM activity. Younger age and female gender were associated with higher likelihood of engaging in all SM activities. No significant ethnic/racial disparities were observed for most SM activities, but Hispanics were found to be more likely to report watching health-related videos. Additionally, those with regular health care access were more likely to participate in online support groups. Previous HINTS survey cycles were also used to examine change in SM use over time, showing that general SM use has increased substantially since 2007, but the use of SM for health-related purposes has not increased to the same extent. The dynamic and evolving nature of SM makes systematic assessment vital.

In the coming decades, we will have unprecedented opportunities to improve MCH, but will also face unprecedented threats. METHODS This paper examines emerging opportunities and threats to MCH, and discusses strategies for leading the future of MCH. RESULTS Scientific advancements will continue to drive improvements in MCH, but to unleash its full potential for improving population health future MCH research must become more transdisciplinary, translational, and precise. Technological innovations could dramatically transform our work in MCH while big data could enhance predictive analytics and precision health; our challenge will be to assure equitable access. The greatest gains in MCH will continue to come from improving social conditions, which will require advancing MCH in all policies. Climate change, infectious outbreaks and antimicrobial resistance pose increasing threats to MCH, which can be averted by reducing global warming, implementing global early warning systems, and instituting responsible antimicrobial stewardship. The growing burden of chronic diseases in children and adults need to be addressed from an ecological and life course perspective. The water crisis in Flint shined a spotlight on the growing health threats from America's decaying infrastructure.

MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 108 ASCC patients treated with IMRT. Clinical information included age, gender, stage, concurrent chemotherapy, mitomycin (MMC) chemotherapy and weekly hematologic and GI toxicity during IMRT. From contours of the bony pelvis and bowel, dose-volume parameters were extracted. Logistic regression models were used to test associations between toxicities and clinical or dosimetric predictors. RESULTS The median age was 59 years, 81 patients were women and 84 patients received concurrent MMC and 5-fluorouracil (5FU). On multivariate analysis (MVA), the model most predictive of Grade 2 + anemia included the maximum bony pelvis dose (Dmax), female gender, and T stage [p = 0.035, cross validation area under the curve (cvAUC) = 0.66]. The strongest model of Grade 2 + leukopenia included V10 (percentage of pelvic bone volume receiving ≥ 10 Gy) and number of MMC cycles (p = 0.276, cvAUC = 0.57). The model including MMC cycle number and T stage correlated best with Grade 2 + neutropenia (p = 0.306, cvAUC = 0.57). The model predictive of combined Grade 2 + hematologic toxicity (HT) included V10 and T stage (p = 0.016, cvAUC = 0.66). A model including VA45 (absolute bowel volume receiving ≥ 45 Gy) and MOH5 (mean dose to hottest 5% of bowel volume) best predicted diarrhea (p = 0.517, cvAUC = 0.56). CONCLUSION Dosimetric constraints to the pelvic bones should be integrated into IMRT planning to reduce toxicity, potentially reducing treatment interruptions and improving disease outcomes in ASCC. Specifically, our results indicate that Dmax should be confined to ≤ 57 Gy to minimize anemia and that V10 should be restricted to ≤ 87% to reduce incidence of all HT.","Julie, Diana A R; Oh, Jung Hun; Apte, Aditya P; Deasy, Joseph O; Tom, Ashlyn; Wu, Abraham J; Goodman, Karyn A",Acta oncologica,227,30

A composite outcome for recurrent pelvic organ prolapse and rectal prolapse was defined as subjective failure (vaginal or rectal prolapse symptoms), objective failure (prolapse to or beyond the hymen or full thickness rectal prolapse), or any retreatment for prolapse. Patient's Global Impression of Change was recorded at baseline and at all follow-up visits. Perioperative adverse events were defined a priori and collected up to 6 weeks after surgery. RESULT A total of 59 patients underwent a ventral rectopexy, either a sacrocolpopexy (48/59, 81.3%) or sacrohysteropexy (11/59, 18.6%). The median follow-up after surgery for all patients was 17 months (range, 1-76) with a composite success rate for both pelvic organ prolapse and rectal prolapse (estimated by Kaplan-Meier method) of 57.4%. Forty (91%) of 44 patients reported a Patient's Global Impression of Change score of 6 or 7, indicating significant improvement after surgery. Of the patients, 15 (25.4%) experienced a perioperative adverse event. Use of biologic graft was associated with a higher rate of adverse event (40.0% [95% confidence interval, 24.6-57.5] vs 10.3% [95% confidence interval, 3.6-26.3]; P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Ventral rectopexy with sacrocolpo- or hysteropexy is associated with significant improvement in anatomic and subjective outcomes. One in 4 women experienced a perioperative adverse event.","Jallad, Karl; Ridgeway, Beri; Paraiso, Marie Fidela R; Gurland, Brooke; Unger, Cecile A",Female pelvic medicine & reconstructive surgery,227,1

The initial version of the device (WEB Double-Layer) was evaluated in the WEB Clinical Assessment of IntraSaccular Aneurysm Therapy (WEBCAST) study, whereas the French Observatory study evaluated both WEB Double-Layer and Single-Layer versions of the device. WEBCAST 2 was designed to evaluate the WEB Single-Layer with Enhanced Visualization. MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients with wide-neck bifurcation aneurysms for which WEB treatment was possible were included. Clinical data including adverse events and clinical status at 1 month and 1 year were collected and analyzed. A core laboratory evaluated anatomic results at 1 year following the procedure. RESULTS Ten European neurointerventional centers included 55 patients (38 women; 27-77 years of age; mean, 54.4 ± 10.0 years) with 55 aneurysms. Aneurysm locations were the middle cerebral artery in 25 aneurysms (45.5%), the anterior communicating artery in 16 (29.1%), the basilar artery in 9 (16.4%), and the internal carotid artery terminus in 5 (9.1%). Procedural morbidity and mortality at 1 month were, respectively, 1.8% (1/55 patients) and 0.0% (0/55 patients). Morbidity and mortality at 1 year were, respectively, 3.9% (2/51 patients) and 2.0% (1/51 patients). At 1 year, complete occlusion was observed in 27/50 aneurysms (54.0%); neck remnant, in 13/50 (26.0%); and aneurysm remnant, in 10/50 (20.0%) (adequate occlusion in 40/50, 80.0%).

The purpose of this study was to examine survival characteristics in patients suffering torso trauma with no recorded vital signs (VS) in the emergency department (ED). METHODS The National Trauma Data Bank was analyzed from 2007 to 2015. Inclusion criteria were patients with blunt and penetrating torso trauma without VS in the ED. Patients with head injuries, transfers from other hospitals, or those with missing values were excluded. The characteristics of survivors were evaluated, and statistical analyses performed. RESULTS A total of 24,191 torso trauma patients without VS were evaluated in the ED and 96.6% were declared dead upon arrival. There were 246 survivors (1%), and 73 (0.3%) were eventually discharged home. Of patients who responded to resuscitation (812), the survival rate was 30.3%. Injury severity score (ISS), penetrating mechanism (odds ratio [OR] 1.99), definitive chest (OR 1.59) and abdominal surgery (OR 1.49) were associated with improved survival. Discharge to home (or police custody) was associated with lower ISS (OR 0.975) and shorter ED time (OR 0.99). CONCLUSION Over a recent nine-year period in the United States, nearly 25,000 trauma patients were treated at trauma centers despite lack of VS. Of these patients, only 73 were discharged home. A trauma center would have to attempt over one hundred resuscitations of traumatic arrests to save one patient, confirming previous reports that highlight a grave prognosis. This creates a dilemma in treatment for front line workers and physicians with resource utilization and consideration of safety of exposure, particularly in the face of COVID-19.","Khalifa, Andrew; Avraham, Jacob B; Kramer, Kristina Z; Bajani, Francesco; Fu, Chih Yuan; Pires-Menard, Alexandra; Kaminsky, Matthew; Bokhari, Faran",The American journal of emergency medicine,227,24

At 25- 60 µm, the diameter of the capillaries was more than twenty times larger than those found in other mammals, as was the diameter of the epidermal contact area of the hairpin turn, which had enlarged up to 200-400 µm(2). At about 13,400, the number of loops per cm(2) was three times higher than in the few other mammalian species measured to date. The remarkable sheath (thickness 2- 20 µm) of the capillary loops consists of a multitude of fine collagen IV fibres, which were in direct contact with the epidermal stratum (str.) basale, emphasizing an origin from the lamina fibroreticularis of the basement membrane. Additionally, the sheath contained many regions filled with free fatty acids. All observations confirmed the view that the walls of the subepidermal capillaries in the hippopotamus are adapted to withstand high blood pressure, permitting a high rate of blood vesselbased heat transfer from the periphery of the body. Until now this function is only known as an important thermoregulatory response in highly active mammals, e.g. dolphins. However, under hot climatic conditions but without strong exercise for cooling, such ability could be an effective and energy-saving procedure in semi-aquatic mammals.","Meyer, Wilfried",Zoological science,227,1

We aimed to evaluate whether each of these systems effectively stratifies cases and for agreement between approaches in order to inform departmental policy. MATERIALS AND METHODS We evaluated triage of elective cases postponed within our department due to the Covid-19 pandemic (3/9/20-5/22/20) using QSP (American College of Surgeons MeNTS instrument), EOP (based upon a published urologic recommendations), and ISP scoring (developed and managed within our department). Lower scores represented greater urgency. MeNTS scores were compared across EOP and ISP scores. RESULTS 204 cases were evaluated. Median MeNTS score was 50 (IQR 44-55), and mean EOP and ISP scores were 2.6±0.6 and 2.2±0.8, respectively. Median MeNTS scores were 52 (46.5, 57.5), 50 (44.5, 54.5), 48 (43.5,54) for ISP priority 1, 2, and 3 cases (p=0.129) and 55 (51.5, 57), 47.5 (42, 56), and 49 (44, 54) for EOP priority scores 1, 2, and 3 (p=0.002). There was none to slight agreement between EOP and ISP scores (Kappa 0.131, p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS Questionnaire-based, expert opinion-base, and individual surgeon-based approaches to case prioritization result in significantly different case prioritization. QSP did not meaningfully stratify urologic cases, and EOP and ISP frequently disagreed. The strengths and weaknesses of each of these systems should be considered in future disaster planning scenarios.","Cohn, Joshua A; Ghiraldi, Eric M; Uzzo, Robert G; Simhan, Jay",The Journal of urology,227,5

Simulation objectives included assessing the plan in terms of a) efficiency and effectiveness; b) comorbidity scoring validity; c) impact by race/ethnicity, gender, age, and payer status; and d) simulation participant impressions of potential impact on clinicians.METHOD The simulation scenario involved scoring 14 patients with the constraint that only 10 could be afforded critical care resources. Also included were independent scoring validation by four clinicians, structured debriefs with simulation participants and observers, and tracking patient outcomes for 30 days.RESULTS Triage scoring was identical among four triage teams. Lack of concordance in clinician comorbidity scoring did not alter patient prioritization for withdrawal of treatment in this small cohort. Protocol scoring was not correlated with resource utilization or near-term mortality.LIMITATIONS The simulation sample was small and selected when COVID-19 census was temporarily waning. No protocol for pediatric patients was tested.CONCLUSIONS The simulation yielded resource allocation concordance using comorbidity scoring by attending physicians, which significantly accelerated triage team decision-making and did not result in notable disparities by race/ethnicity, gender, or advanced age. Qualitative findings surfaced tensions in balancing de-identified data with individualized assessment and in trusting the clinical judgments of other physicians. Additional research is needed to validate the protocol's predictive value related to patient outcomes.","Love, Deborah J; Nycum, Lawrence R; Blackmon, Tanya Stewart; Patefield, A J; Bird, Paula; Stoker, Shelli E; Piersol, R Andrew; Koontz, Adam N; Collard, Amy L",North Carolina medical journal,227,12

Its consequences were the implementation of national measures such as the containment of the population, but also a disorganization of the healthcare system, in particular concerning oral care. Indeed, dental procedures produce aerosols which can be loaded with viral particles, and as such, constitute a major contamination route by the virus. At the request of the Conference of Deans of the Faculties of Odontology, the National College of University Dentists in Public Health (CNCDUSP) set up a working group in order to issue recommendations for oral care in the context of the COVID-19 epidemic, given the specific risks faced by practitioners. Considering the lack of awareness of the specifics of dentistry in the medical world and among decision-makers, and given the speed with which national measures to fight the epidemic were implemented, the recommendations of the CNCDUSP had to be drawn up rigorously and quickly before being released to the profession. They take into account epidemiological data related to the virus, the specificities of oral care, and thus propose protective measures for dental surgery professionals.The necessary adaptation of the healthcare system during an epidemic will certainly make it possible to learn lessons from this health crisis.","Offner, Damien; Merigo, Elisabetta; Tardivo, Delphine; Gros, Catherine-Isabelle; Lupi, Laurence; Musset, Anne-Marie",Sante publique,227,19

Shear wave elastography can be used to quantify the shear modulus (i.e. an index of stiffness) of a specific muscle. This study assessed the passive behavior of lower leg muscles during passive dorsiflexion performed with the knee fully extended (experiment 1, n = 22) or with the knee flexed at 90° (experiment 2, n = 20). The shear modulus measurements were repeated twice during experiment 1 to assess the inter-day reliability. During both experiments, the shear modulus of the following plantar flexors was randomly measured: gastrocnemii medialis (GM) and lateralis (GL), soleus (SOL), peroneus longus (PL), and the deep muscles flexor digitorum longus (FDL), flexor hallucis longus (FHL), tibialis posterior (TP). Two antagonist muscles tibialis anterior (TA), and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) were also recorded. Measurements were performed in different proximo-distal regions for GM, GL and SOL. Inter-day reliability was adequate for all muscles (coefficient of variation < 15%), except for TP. In experiment 1, GM exhibited the highest shear modulus at 80% of the maximal range of motion (128.5 ± 27.3 kPa) and was followed by GL (67.1 ± 24.1 kPa). In experiment 2, SOL exhibited the highest shear modulus (55.1 ± 18.0 kPa). The highest values of shear modulus were found for the distal locations of both the GM (80% of participants in experiment 1) and the SOL (100% of participants in experiment 2). For both experiments, deep muscles and PL exhibited low levels of stiffness during the stretch in young asymptomatic adults, which was unknown until now. These results provide a deeper understanding of passive mechanical properties and the distribution of stiffness between and within the plantar flexor muscles during stretching between them and thus could be relevant to study the effects of aging, disease progression, and rehabilitation on stiffness.","Le Sant, Guillaume; Nordez, Antoine; Andrade, Ricardo; Hug, François; Freitas, Sandro; Gross, Raphaël",Journal of anatomy,227,19

OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to identify factors that influence glycemic outcomes and diabetes remission 12 months after sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or gastric bypass (GB) in a multiethnic Asian cohort. SETTING The study's setting was in a tertiary hospital in Singapore. METHODS Data from 145 T2D patients who had SG (37%) or GB (63%) and at least 1-year follow-up were analyzed. Diabetes remission was defined as hemoglobin A1c ≤ 6.0% without diabetes medications. Analysis involved binary logistic regression to identify predictors and general linear regression for variables associated with glycemic improvement after surgery. RESULTS Baseline parameters are as follows: BMI 40.0 ± 7.6 kg/m2, A1c 8.4 ± 1.6%, diabetes duration 9.3 years, ethnic composition: Chinese (51.7%), Malay (23.4%), Indian (20.7%), Others (4.1%). 55.9% achieved diabetes remission at 1 year. Baseline A1c, baseline BMI, and diabetes duration were significant pre-operative factors for remission (cumulative R 2 = 0.334). At 12 months, percentage weight loss was similar after SG (24.1 ± 7.4%) and GB (25.4 ± 7.4%, p = 0.31). Greater A1c decrease was seen with GB compared to SG (2.7 ± 1.6 vs 2.0 ± 1.5%, p = 0.006), significant even after adjustment for weight loss, age, BMI, baseline A1c, and diabetes duration (p = 0.033). Weight loss at 12 months also correlated independently with A1c reduction. Ethnicity did not influence weight loss, diabetes remission, or glycemic control after MBS. CONCLUSION Baseline A1c, baseline BMI, and diabetes duration independently predict diabetes remission after MBS. GB is more effective in controlling T2D compared to SG despite similar weight loss, whereas ethnicity does not play a significant role in the multiethnic Asian cohort.","Lee, Phong Ching; Tham, Kwang Wei; Ganguly, Sonali; Tan, Hong Chang; Eng, Alvin Kim Hock; Dixon, John B",Obesity surgery,227,6

We enrolled consecutive adult alloHCT survivors and non-HCT control individuals (January 2019-March 2020), matched for traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Microvascular dysfunction was dynamically assessed in real time by Laser Speckle Contrast Analysis (LASCA). Carotid-femoral pulse-wave velocity (PWV) and carotid intima media thickness (IMT) were assessed as surrogate markers of cardiovascular disease.

CASE REPORT We report the case of a 76-year-old woman with a history of May-Hegglin anomaly who presented with an isolated unusual diffuse headache. Initial laboratory investigations showed only thrombocytopenia (platelet count 95000/μL). Unenhanced brain computed tomography scan revealed a small subarachnoid hemorrhage in the left frontal lobe. Computed tomography angiography showed occlusion of the terminal portion of the left internal carotid artery (ICA) and narrowing of the terminal portion of the right ICA with abnormal collateral vessels. Conventional angiography confirmed the tight stenosis of the extremity of the right ICA, and the occlusion of the left ICA, associated with an extensive collateral network consistent with moyamoya syndrome. No aneurysm was identified. CONCLUSIONS The rarity of these 2 diseases makes a fortuitous association very unlikely. We thus concluded that this observation could be the first reported case of May-Hegglin anomaly as a cause of moyamoya syndrome.","Béjot, Yannick; Barnay, José-Luis; Chavent, Adrien; Daubail, Benoit; Jacquin, Agnès; Kazemi, Apolline; Ricolfi, Frédéric; Giroud, Maurice",The neurologist,227,31

The cohort included large or giant intracranial aneurysms and recurrent aneurysms following conventional endovascular treatment. Major morbidity was observed in 1 patient, who developed basal ganglia bleed that needed evacuation. Minor complications were seen in 36% of patients without clinical sequelae. Significant obliteration of aneurysm was noted on 1 month computed tomography angiogram in >80% of the patients. Angiographic complete obliteration was noted in 89% of the patients at 6 months.

In this study, we purposed to investigate the effectiveness of the technique of ""retrograde approach through the posterior communicating artery to the ophthalmic artery (OA)"" for IAC. METHODS A total of 12 unilateral retinoblastomas were treated with IAC in 29 sessions from October 2011 to November 2013. Of the 12 patients, 6 were male and 6 were female, with ages ranging from 12 to 72 months with a median age of 27.6 months. Left-to-right ratio for affected eye was 6/6. In the first 4 patients, we used the ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) to reach the OA of the affected globe (10 sessions). Then, we used the vertebral artery, basilary artery, ipsilateral/contralateral P1 segment of the posterior cerebral artery, and ipsilateral/contralateral posterior communicating artery, respectively, to reach inside the OA at next 15 sessions. RESULTS At ipsilateral approach, fluoroscopy total time ranged from 16 to 34 min (mean 21.5 min), and the angle between ophthalmic segment of the ICA and proximal segment of the OA was ranged between 34° and 77° with an average angle of 53.4°. At retrograde approach, fluoroscopy total time ranged from 3 to 12 min (mean 7.5 min), and the angle between ophthalmic segment of the ICA and proximal segment of the OA was ranged between 147° and 178° with an average angle of 148.3°. CONCLUSION Retrograde approach makes the IAC procedure easier in retinoblastoma patients and shortens the fluoroscopy time.","Saglam, Muzaffer; Sarici, Ahmet; Anagnostakou, Vania; Yildiz, Bulent; Kocer, Naci; Islak, Civan; Kizilkilic, Osman",Neuroradiology,227,1
158077,158077,158077,Appropriate Opioid Prescribing for Acute Pain.,18.836632,8.423071,2021-08-09,"BACKGROUND In common with many other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), rural to urban migrants in India are at increased risk of obesity, but it is unclear whether this is due to increased energy intake, reduced energy expenditure, or both. Knowing this and the relative contribution of specific dietary and physical activity behaviours to greater adiposity among urban migrants could inform policies for control of the obesity epidemic in India and other urbanising LMICs. In the Indian Migration Study, we previously found that urban migrants had greater prevalence of obesity and diabetes compared with their nonmigrant rural-dwelling siblings. In this study, we investigated the relative contribution of energy intake and expenditure and specific diet and activity behaviours to greater adiposity among urban migrants in India. METHODS AND FINDINGS The Indian Migration Study was conducted between 2005 and 2007. Factory workers and their spouses from four cities in north, central, and south of India, together with their rural-dwelling siblings, were surveyed. Self-reported data on diet and physical activity was collected using validated questionnaires, and adiposity was estimated from thickness of skinfolds. The association of differences in dietary intake, physical activity, and adiposity between siblings was examined using multivariable linear regression. Data on 2,464 participants (median age 43 years) comprised of 1,232 sibling pairs (urban migrant and their rural-dwelling sibling) of the same sex (31% female) were analysed. Compared with the rural siblings, urban migrants had 18% greater adiposity, 12% (360 calories/day) more energy intake, and 18% (11 kilojoules/kg/day) less energy expenditure (P < 0.001 for all). Energy intake and expenditure were independently associated with increased adiposity of urban siblings, accounting for 4% and 6.5% of adiposity difference between siblings, respectively. Difference in dietary fat/oil (10 g/day), time spent engaged in moderate or vigorous activity (69 minutes/day), and watching television (30 minutes/day) were associated with difference in adiposity between siblings, but no clear association was observed for intake of fruits and vegetables, sugary foods and sweets, cereals, animal and dairy products, and sedentary time. The limitations of this study include a cross-sectional design, systematic differences in premigration characteristics of migrants and nonmigrants, low response rate, and measurement error in estimating diet and activity from questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS We found that increased energy intake and reduced energy expenditure contributed equally to greater adiposity among urban migrants in India. Policies aimed at controlling the rising prevalence of obesity in India and potentially other urbanising LMICs need to be multicomponent, target both energy intake and expenditure, and focus particularly on behaviours such as dietary fat/oil intake, time spent on watching television, and time spent engaged in moderate or vigorous intensity physical activity.","Kinra, Sanjay; Mallinson, Poppy Alice Carson; Cresswell, Jenny A; Bowen, Liza J; Lyngdoh, Tanica; Prabhakaran, Dorairaj; Reddy, Kolli Srinath; Vaz, Mario; Kurpad, Anura V; Davey Smith, George; Ben-Shlomo, Yoav; Ebrahim, Shah",PLoS medicine,227,24

MATERIALS AND METHODS An observational, retrospective, non-randomized study. RESULTS One hundred four (62.6%) patients met the inclusion criteria, 96 (92.3%) patients were male, and 8 (7.7%) patients were female. The mean age of the study group was 66 ± 11 years (min: 34/max: 90). All the patients underwent CO2TOLMS were treated as an outpatient procedure. The glottis was the most common location affecting 97 (93.3%) patients, regarding the need of readmission, just 4 (3.8%) patients needed to be readmitted after surgery due to dyspnea secondary to laryngeal edema in 2 cases by laryngeal bleeding, and cervical emphysema in one case, respectively. Being just necessary to reintubate 1 patient (<1%) to control the bleeding. We didn't find any statistical correlation between variables and the need for readmission of reintubation. CONCLUSION According to our results, CO2TOLMS of the larynx can be safely performed as an outpatient procedure. To establish a proper protocol and to perform a careful preoperative assessment are essential to increase our success rate and to prevent any potential complication.","Chiesa-Estomba, Carlos M; Sistiaga Suarez, Jon A; Ninchritz-Becerra, Elisabeth; Soriano-Reixach, Maria; González-García, Jose A; Larruscain, Ekhiñe; Altuna, Xabier","Ear, nose, & throat journal",227,13

However, quite recently, such research regarding relationships between the health conditions of residents and toxic elements in the TSMD began to grow. The increase of empirical studies means greater complexity of the findings that require a more intricate understanding. To meet the goals of this study, an extensive, systematic review of the literature using PRISMA was conducted. This method resulted in 19 articles that define the harmful effects of the TSMD on the ecology and the physical health of residents. This research found that toxic metals not only negatively impact natural processes in the TSMD environments (fish species reduction, kidney and liver problems, and toxic diet) but also continuously affect the health of residents (high blood Pb and mortality).This study makes a vital contribution building upon the existing outcomes of the correlations between toxic elements in the TSMD areas and the health of residents. Furthermore, conclusions of this study provide updated information to policymakers and health-related professionals by providing adequate and innovative remediations and health-related services in the TSMD.","Park, Hyejoon; Noh, Keeyoon; Min, Jihyun Jane; Rupar, Christopher",International journal of environmental research and public health,227,17

A systematic review of qualitative literature,19.067766,8.306107,2021-01-04,"Parasites and pathogens vary strikingly in their virulence and the resulting selection they impose on their hosts. While the evolution of different virulence levels is well studied, the evolution of host resistance in response to different virulence levels is less understood and as of now mainly based on theoretical predictions. Increased virulence can increase selection for host resistance evolution if resistance costs are outweighed by the benefits of avoiding infection. To test this, we experimentally evolved the bacterium Vibrio alginolyticus against two variants of the filamentous phage, VALGΦ8, that differ in their virulence. The bacterial host exhibited two alternative defence strategies against future viral infection: (1) super infection exclusion (SIE) whereby viral-infected cells were immune to subsequent infection at a cost of reduced growth, and (2) surface receptor mutations in genes encoding the MSHA type-IV pilus providing resistance to infection by preventing viral binding. While SIE emerged rapidly against both viruses, resistance evolved faster against the high virulence compared to the low virulence virus. Using a mathematical model of our system we show that increasing virulence strengthens selection for resistance due to the higher costs of infection suffered by SIE immune hosts. In both the experiments and the model, higher levels of evolved resistance in the host population drove more rapid virus extinction. Thus, by accelerating the evolution of host resistance, more virulent viruses caused shorter epidemics.","Wendling, Carolin C.; Lange, Janina; Liesegang, Heiko; Sieber, Michael; Pöhlein, Anja; Bunk, Boyke; Rajkov, Jelena; Goehlich, Henry; Roth, Olivia; Brockhurst, Michael A.",bioRxiv,227,25

Prior research focused on unidirectional pedestrian modelling, especially with overtaking behaviour, is limited. Moreover, pedestrian behaviour in the context of COVID-19 is rarely investigated. Inspired by the social force model, this paper proposes a dynamic sensitivity model for unidirectional pedestrian flow, which is able to describe the overtaking behaviour and analyse the potential impact of COVID-19 on pedestrian behaviour. In the proposed model, dynamic sensitivity and attention field of pedestrians are introduced to embody the effects of individual characteristics and surrounding environments on pedestrian behaviours. To calibrate the model and evaluate the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on pedestrian dynamics, real-life data collected by video recordings in Nanjing, China is used in this study. The simulation results indicate that the dynamic sensitivity model is able to reflect the variance of the adaptive velocity and route choice of overtaking pedestrians on unidirectional pedestrian flow. Our research findings show that the social distance during COVID-19 is higher than the value under normal conditions, and the majority of pedestrians tend to follow the suggested social distancing rules during COVID-19. Moreover, the overtaking pedestrians violate the suggested social distancing rules more frequently than the rest pedestrians.

The causative agent is highly contagious, and its rapid blowout has affected almost every country of the world, endangering thousands of lives. Recently, the WHO has raised the COVID-19 epidemic threat to the “very high” level. Pathophysiological mechanisms are related to the inter-related functioning of various viral polyproteins, structural proteins as well as Non-Structural Proteins (NSP). These proteins play a crucial role in accelerating pathogenesis by promoting viral replication, viral assembly, and virion release, thereby disabling the overall host distinctive immunological system. Presently, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19. The majority of the treatments focus on symptomatic relief and supportive therapy only. Although several drugs have been investigated against coronavirus in numerous clinical trials, only a few exhibited mild-moderate signs of clinical recovery. Drugs that are being repurposed and researched include an anti-malarial drug, hydroxychloroquine;anti-HIV drugs, lopinavir, Remdesivir alone, or in combination;anti-influenza drugs like umifenovir, and favilavir;anti-arthritic baracitinib, and anti-interleukins. Various research articles demonstrated the excellent potential of hydroxychloroquine either alone or in combination with anti-HIV drugs lopinavir, and Remdesivir at the cellular level;however, exhaustive clinical support and validation are still desirable for repurposing these drugs.

Design, setting and participants Mixed-methods feasibility study in Physician Associate programmes from two United Kingdom and one United States university during 2019 to 2020. Primary, secondary outcomes Feasibility measures (test retest reliability acceptability and usability) were assessed using intra-class correlation, descriptive statistics, thematic and content analysis. Methods Volunteers took (Test 1), then repeated (Test 2), the automated MMI, with a seven-day interval, then completed an evaluation questionnaire. Admissions staff participated in focus group discussions. Results Sixty-two students and seven admission staff participated; 34 students and four staff from UK and 28 students and three staff from US universities. Good-excellent test-retest reliability was observed with Test 1 and Test 2 ICC between 0.62-0.81 p< 0.001 when assessed by individual total scores (range 80.6-119), station total scores 0.6-0.91, p< 0.005, individual site (all ICC [≥]0.76, p<0.001) and mean test retest across sites 0.82, p<0.001 (95% CI 0.7-0.9).

In Germany the first SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was a superspreading event in a rural area during indoor carnival festivities in February 2020. Methods 51 days after the event all known participants were asked to give blood samples, pharyngeal swabs and answer a self-administered questionnaire. Metric room coordinates for all tables, seats, and ventilation-points were assessed. Findings We analyzed infection rates among all 411 participants, and the risk of infection in relation to various factors including age, alcohol consumption, and ventilation system. Overall, 46% (n=186/404) of the participants had been infected. We demonstrate that the spatial distribution of infected participants was associated with proximity to the ventilation system (represented as inverse distance, with Odds Ratio OR 1.39, 95% KI [0.86; 2.25]). Interestingly, the risk of infection was highly associated with age, whereby children (OR: 0.33 [0.267; 0.414]) and young adults (age 18-25) had a lower risk of infection than older participants resulting in an average infection risk increase of 28% per 10 years age difference. Behavioral differences also impacted the risk of infection including time spent outside (OR: 0.55 [0.33; 0.91]) or smoking (OR: 0.32 [0.124; 0.81]). Interpretation Our findings underline the importance of proper indoor ventilation for events in the future. The lower susceptibility for children and young adults indicates their limited involvement in superspreading events.","Wessendorf, L.; Richter, E.; Schulte, B.; Schmithausen, R.

The goal of our paper is to contextualize Latin American ecologists' contribution at the world level based on the four most scientifically productive countries in the region. Methods and findings: Ioannidis et al. (2020) proposed a composite index that is the sum of six scientometric indicators: (1) The number of allocites, (2) the h index, (3) a per capita corrected version of h, (4) the allocites received as single author, (5) those received as single + first author, and (6) those as single + first + last author. We selected data for ecologists from Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Mexico and comparatively analyzed their productivity according to the proposed index. We also compared these data with those obtained from a global sample of the top ecologists worldwide. Conclusions: Based on Ioannidis et al.'s proposition to evaluate scientific productivity we extract three lessons: (1) It does not pay to publish many papers;what counts is the number of allocites (i.e., self-citations do not add up). (2) Either be single, first, or last author;it does not pay to be in the middle of an authorship line. (3) Even worse it is to be among many co-authors because the proposed index allocates credits on a per capita basis.

Results: According to the PSQI results, the participants of our study were divided into two groups as PSQI &gt;= 5 (n=109, 71.7%) and PSQI &lt;5 (n=43, 28.1%). In the group with poor sleep quality (PSQI &gt;= 5), there were more females (p=0.003), the average age was younger (p=0.013), and the rate of anxiety and depression was higher (p&lt;0.001 and p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: According to the results of our study, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the quality of sleep of the healthcare staff was significantly impaired. The health of health professionals is also important in this long process. Practices for improving the quality of sleep of healthcare staff will contribute to the long-term struggle by strengthening the immune system in the fight of health workers against the virus.","Akinci, T.; Basar, H.

This paper targets the vaccines’ allocation in several periods for various and separated demand zones. To discover and make the al-location network more efficient and help the policymaker decide more wisely, we implement a smart contract to suggest product allocation in different cases taking into account dynamical changes. Our smart contract tries to decrease the uncovered demands and facilitate the governments’ prediction of the demands and evolution of a disease in demand zones. In this manner, several reactions of the smart contract are considered through different scenarios that can happen in the pandemics. The cases are sudden increase, sudden decrease, and steady demands. Moreover, we discuss the validity of the proposed smart contract and its benefits. Finally, we discuss the future aspects of our work and other objectives that can be useful in the proposed problem. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Yazdani, M.

This assessment is prerequisite if university education is to be less dependent on the face-to-face experience throughout the educational process. The COVID-19 pandemic has become both a challenge and an opportunity to implement certain changes in the world of education. One of the most important differences has been online evaluation, which had, until now, been marginal in most prestigious universities. This study compared the academic achievement of the last cohort that performed classroom assessment and the first group that was graded for an official degree using synchronous online evaluation. Other variables measured were the self-assessment of students in this second group, in order to understand how it affected their perception of the process using three different indicators: stress, difficulty, and fairness. Nine hundred and nineteen students participated in the study. The results indicate that online assessment resulted in grades that were 10% higher while enjoying the same degree of validity and reliability. In addition, stress and difficulty levels were also in line with the on-site experience, as was the perception that the results were fair. The results allow us to conclude that online evaluation, when proctored, provides the same guarantees as desktop exams, with the added bonus of certain advantages which strongly support their continued use, especially in degrees with many students who may come from many different locations.","Sanchez-Cabrero, R.; Casado-Perez, J.; Arigita-Garcia, A.; Zubiaurre-Ibanez, E.; Gil-Pareja, D.; Sanchez-Rico, A.",Applied Sciences-Basel,227,21

This paper aims to present a thorough investigation of these perceptions and limited acceptance of social media marketing among SME retailers in a developing country during a crisis.Design/methodology/approachThe investigation was designed using a mixed-method design. A qualitative investigation, as the first part, explored SME retailers’ perceptions of the use of social media marketing when they were faced with mandatory lockdown that stifled their business activity. The insights from qualitative study and literature helped devise the second part of the study, a quantitative study using the technology acceptance model (TAM). Analysis of responses from a sample of SME retailers (n = 149) was done using SEM in this study.FindingsIn the qualitative study, SME retailers were found to have a varying outlook toward social media marketing. Some ventured into social media marketing while others were impeded by their limited understanding. The second (quantitative) study showed the general applicability of TAM such that perceived ease of use through perceived usefulness influenced SME retailers’ attitudes toward the usage of social media marketing during the COVID-19 crisis. An important finding in both studies was that business owners’ education level influenced their perceptions of social media marketing.Research limitations/implicationsThe investigation, albeit a comprehensive one, was conducted in a particular market and for SME retailers. This opens avenues for conducting similar studies in other segments of entrepreneurs to generate insights based on comparative analysis across segments and scenarios.Originality/valueLimited or no marketing in the physical marketplace amid lockdown meant almost an existential crisis for entrepreneurs, especially SME retailers, in developing countries during the COVID-19 crisis. While technology acceptance by SME retailers has been discussed in the literature, there are limited discourses on technology acceptance among entrepreneurs and SME retailers during a crisis. These findings from the COVID-19 crisis explicate the possibilities and limitations of technology usage as a means to mitigate challenges faced by entrepreneurs during a crisis.","Muhammad Talha, Salam Hamza Imtiaz Burhan Muhammad",Journal of Entrepreneurship in Emerging Economies,227,11

STUDY AIM To survey hospital board chairs about governance practices, particularly with respect to approval processes for oversight of management preparedness for unforeseen emergencies. METHODS A 2004 survey of hospital managers initially suggested greater board leadership in risk management as a desired strategic priority for Ontario's acute care hospitals. Our literature review and panel process defined 34 best practices in board governance, including two practices explicitly addressing the board's role in preparing for risk. RESULTS Our findings revealed that some boards may not be actively engaged in ensuring that adequate processes are in place to protect against risk. More than one-quarter (n=28, 26.9%) of board chairs reported that they had not approved a management plan to address emergencies. Thirty respondents (28.8%) said they had not approved a process to identify, manage and minimize risks to the hospital's sustainability. Forty-seven respondents (45.2%) said they had not approved both of these two processes. A significant association emerged between boards that had approved both risk preparation strategies and boards that had implemented six key governance practices relating to accountability for leadership and stakeholder communication.","Seeman, Neil; Baker, G Ross; Brown, Adalsteinn D",Healthcare policy = Politiques de sante,227,28

It is also expressed by leukaemic blasts of a small group of patients suffering from acute or chronic lymphoid leukaemia. CD13-specific monoclonal antibodies do not bind to the surface of normal B lymphocytes, and APN mRNA was not detectable by Northern analysis in normal lymphocytes or in T-cell lines. Recently the expression of the APN gene in T-cell lines as well as the ability of these cells to cleave chromogenic substrates preferred by APN have been demonstrated [Lendeckel, Wex, Kähne, Frank, Reinhold and Ansorge (1994) Cell. Immunol. 153, 214-226]. Here, by means of dot-blot hybridization and RNase protection assay, evidence is provided that human peripheral T-cells as well as derived cell lines contain significant amounts of APN mRNA, comparable to that in the promyeloic cell line U937, and that mitogenic activation of peripheral human T-cells leads to a more than 4-fold increase in their APN mRNA content. In the course of activation, T-cells increase their total alanine p-nitroanilide-hydrolysing activity to approx. 7-fold that of resting cells. Furthermore these cells become immunoreactive towards CD13 to a significant extent (up to 51%) as shown by surface staining and confirmed by activity staining and immunostaining after isoelectric focusing (pI of T-cell APN = 4.6). In addition it is demonstrated by fluorescence microscopy that viable, activated T-cells effectively cleave the fluorogenic aminopeptidase substrate bis-glycyl-rhodamine 110 and that the corresponding aminopeptidase activity is associated with the cell surface. We show that specific inhibitors of APN, probestin and actinonin, strongly decrease DNA synthesis in phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated T-cells. In summary, evidence is presented that in the course of mitogenic activation human peripheral T-cells increase the expression of APN both at the transcriptional level and at the cell surface. This has been demonstrated both at the APN mRNA level and at the protein level with respect to aminopeptidase enzymic activity and CD13 immunoreactivity.","Lendeckel, U; Wex, T; Reinhold, D; Kähne, T; Frank, K; Faust, J; Neubert, K; Ansorge, S",The Biochemical journal,227,9

We have examined the recombination process in geminiviruses by forcing recombination between two distinct isolates of Maize streak virus (MSV), MSV-Kom and MSV-Set. Heterodimeric agroinfectious constructs containing tandemly cloned mixtures of complete or partial MSV-Set and MSV-Kom genomes were used to simulate a circular dimeric form similar to that which would be expected to occur following a single intermolecular crossing-over event between MSV-Set and MSV-Kom replicative form DNAs at the long intergenic region (LIR)-movement protein gene (MP) interface. We isolated, analysed and biologically characterized many of the recombinant MSV genomes that were generated from the constructs in planta. Apart from having the same simulated breakpoint at the LIR-MP interface, all the genomes examined had a second breakpoint that had been generated through either intramolecular homologous recombination or a replicational release mechanism. The pathogenicities of six predominantly MSV-Kom-like recombinants were tested in maize. While all were capable of producing a symptomatic infection in this host, none was more virulent than MSV-Kom and only two were more virulent than MSV-Set. The two most virulent recombinants were leafhopper transmitted to a range of differentially MSV-resistant maize, wheat and barley genotypes and both were found to have unique biological properties.","Schnippenkoetter, W H; Martin, D P; Willment, J A; Rybicki, E P",The Journal of general virology,227,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS This cross-sectional survey was conducted in the antenatal clinics of KK Women's and Children's Hospital, Singapore, from 31 March to 25 April 2020 to assess pregnant women's knowledge of COVID-19, their perceptions of its impact upon pregnancy and psychological impact using the validated Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21). RESULTS Of the 324 women who participated in the study, the mean age was 31.8 years (range, 20-45). The majority (53.7%) were multiparous with mean gestational age of 23.4 weeks (SD 10). The commonest sources of information were Internet-based social media platforms. A significant proportion were unaware, or associated COVID-19 infection during pregnancy with fetal distress (82.1%), intrauterine death (71.3%), fetal anomalies (69.8%), miscarriages (64.8%), preterm labour (67.9%) and rupture of membranes (61.4%). A total of 116 (35.8%) women screened positive for anxiety, 59 (18.2%) for depression, and 36 (11.1%) for stress. There was a significant association between household size and stress scores [B = 0.0454 (95% CI, 0.0035-0.0873)]. Women who associated COVID-19 infection with fetal anomalies and intrauterine fetal death had significantly higher anxiety scores [B = -0.395 (95% CI, -0.660 to -0.130) and B = -0.291 (95% CI, -0.562 to -0.021) respectively]. CONCLUSION Our study highlights that a lack of timely and reliable information on the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and its outcomes results in increased levels of depression, anxiety and stress.

METHODS A retrospective analysis was conducted among 225 SARS patients treated in our in 2003. Oxygenation index was used as the effectness index, and the criteria for effectiveness was defiend as increase of the value of OI by 20% or above. RESULTS Glococoticostecoids were used in 59.56% of the SARS cases. The average value of OI before intravenous use of glucocorticosteroids was 237.08 mmHg, and that after the administration was 335.08 mmHg. The glucocorticosteroid doses that produce better effects were 1-3 mg/kg and 160-240 mg daily, with the total accumulative dose of 1000-2000 mg. The optimal duration of glucocorticosteroid use was 8-14 days. CONCLUSIONS For SARS treatment, Glucocorticosteroids can effectively ameliorate the SARS patients' lung symptoms and improve the lung function. The appropriate daily dose of glucocorticosteroids is 1-3 mg/kg or 160-240 mg/d for a duration of 8-14 d; the accumulative dose should be controlled around 1500 mg.","Jia, Wei-Dong; Deng, Xi-Long; Tang, Xiao-Ping; Yin, Chi-Biao; Zhang, Fu-Chun; Yang, Zhan; Fang, Ji-Qian",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,227,11

The stability of SARS coronavirus in human specimens and in environments was studied. METHODS Using a SARS coronavirus strain CoV-P9, which was isolated from pharyngeal swab of a probable SARS case in Beijing, its stability in mimic human specimens and in mimic environment including surfaces of commonly used materials or in household conditions, as well as its resistance to temperature and UV irradiation were analyzed. A total of 10(6) TCID50 viruses were placed in each tested condition, and changes of the viral infectivity in samples after treatments were measured by evaluating cytopathic effect (CPE) in cell line Vero-E6 at 48 h after infection. RESULTS The results showed that SARS coronavirus in the testing condition could survive in serum, 1:20 diluted sputum and feces for at least 96 h, whereas it could remain alive in urine for at least 72 h with a low level of infectivity. The survival abilities on the surfaces of eight different materials and in water were quite comparable, revealing reduction of infectivity after 72 to 96 h exposure. Viruses stayed stable at 4 degrees C, at room temperature (20 degrees C) and at 37 degrees C for at least 2 h without remarkable change in the infectious ability in cells, but were converted to be non-infectious after 90-, 60- and 30-min exposure at 56 degrees C, at 67 degrees C and at 75 degrees C, respectively. Irradiation of UV for 60 min on the virus in culture medium resulted in the destruction of viral infectivity at an undetectable level. CONCLUSION The survival ability of SARS coronavirus in human specimens and in environments seems to be relatively strong. Heating and UV irradiation can efficiently eliminate the viral infectivity.","Duan, Shu-Ming; Zhao, Xin-Sheng; Wen, Rui-Fu; Huang, Jing-Jing; Pi, Guo-Hua; Zhang, Su-Xiang; Han, Jun; Bi, Sheng-Li; Ruan, Li; Dong, Xiao-Ping",Biomedical and environmental sciences : BES,227,1

This event underscored a very serious reality--on the whole, Canada's health system was not prepared to quickly and efficiently deal with a health emergency. This reality was particularly clear in Canada's largest city, Toronto, as the hospital system was not able to contain the outbreak. Armed with little knowledge of the nature of the threat or epidemiology of the disease, the health system was overwhelmed with how to deal with this crisis. Perhaps of greatest concern, however, was the inability to provide accurate and timely information to health institutions, healthcare workers and the public regarding the appropriate procedures and precautions to ensure optimal safety for all persons and control the spread of disease. This paper makes the case that the integration of occupational health and safety into pandemic planning is key to its success.","Silas, Linda; Johnson, Nancy; Rexe, Kate",HealthcarePapers,227,1

Much of the literature on masks consists of anecdotal evidence or summaries of previous studies. The rationale for wearing masks has shifted from protection of the patient to protection of the health care professional wearing the mask. Currently there is little evidence that wearing a surgical mask provides sufficient protection from all the hazards likely to be encountered in an acute health care setting: the use of a respirator and face shield should be considered depending on the circumstances.,"Lipp, Allyson",Nursing times,227,20

Twenty years ago, home wound care professionals, advised by remote experts using telemedicine, were achieving sterling chronic wound outcomes. Mobile technology has sharply reduced transportation costs compared with clinic visits. Registered nurses using smartphones to access a web-based surgical infection site (SIS) surveillance algorithm based on validated Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, extended reliable, valid SIS surveillance into the first month of home care as recommended in the guidelines. This improved timely SIS identification and management while generating a registry that motivated patients and caregivers. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic accelerated needs for evidence-based care delivered by telemedicine, empowering wound care professionals to deliver quality care while limiting risks associated with patient contact. This installment of Evidence Corner reviews 2 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) that used telehealth in varying ways to improve health care delivery and outcomes. One reported use of a telehealth application is to improve patient knowledge and outcomes of diabetic foot care. The second compared clinical and economic outcomes for patients with complex wounds whose local clinicians delivered home care guided by remote experts using telemedicine with those of similar patients managed without expert advice in the home or patients who attended wound clinics.","Bolton, Laura",Wounds : a compendium of clinical research and practice,227,26

RT-PCR, Western blotting and immunocytochemistry were used to detect the expression of ACE2 and CD209L receptors. RESULTS Both SARS-CoV receptors of ACE2 and CD209L were expressed in the 8 organ/tissue-derived endothelial cells. The expression of ACE2 receptor was the highest in the human lung microvascular endothelial cells, and lowest in the lymphatic endothelial cells. The expression of CD209L was relatively higher in the human lymphatic endothelial cells. CONCLUSION The organ derived microvascular endothelial cells are the important target of SARS-CoV.

By immunologic screening, a clone representing this prothrombinase was isolated from a cDNA library and sequenced. The sequence identified this clone as representing part of a gene, musfiblp, that encodes a fibrinogen-like protein. Six additional clones were isolated, and one clone, p11-3-1, encompassed the entire coding region of musfiblp. Murine macrophages did not constitutively express musfiblp but, when infected with MHV-3, synthesized musfiblp-specific mRNA. musfiblp mRNA induction was earlier and significantly greater in BALB/cJ than A/J macrophages. Prothrombinase activity was demonstrated when musfiblp was expressed from p11-3-1 in RAW 264.7 cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS From March 11, 2003, to April 2, 2003, 74 patients with symptoms and signs suggestive of SARS underwent CT of the thorax; all underwent thin-section CT except for one patient who underwent conventional CT. Group 1 (n = 23) patients had symptoms of SARS in keeping with criteria from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a positive chest radiograph. Group 2 (n = 17) patients had a high clinical suspicion of SARS but a normal radiograph. Group 3 (n = 34) patients had minor symptoms and a normal chest radiograph. The thin-section CT images were analyzed for ground-glass opacification or consolidation, lesion size in each lung segment, peripheral or central location, interstitial thickening, and other abnormalities. RESULTS Thin-section CT scans were abnormal only for patients in groups 1 and 2. The patient with only conventional CT scans was in group 3; scans for group 3 patients were normal. Affected segments were predominantly in the lower lobes (91 of 149 affected segments). Common findings included ground-glass opacification, sometimes with consolidation, and interlobular septal and intralobular interstitial thickening. The size of each lesion and the total number of segments involved were smaller in group 2 patients. A majority of patients in group 1 (14 of 23) had mixed central and peripheral lesions. In group 2, however, peripheral lesions were more common (10 of 17). In both groups, a purely central lesion was uncommon (one of 23 in group 1 and two of 17 in group 2). CONCLUSION Common thin-section CT features of SARS are ground-glass opacification and lower lobe and peripheral distribution.","Wong, K T; Antonio, Gregory E; Hui, David S C; Lee, Nelson; Yuen, Edmund H Y; Wu, Alan; Leung, C B; Rainer, T H; Cameron, Peter; Chung, Sydney S C; Sung, Joseph J Y; Ahuja, Anil T",Radiology,227,21

However, there are increasing concerns about the severe economic and wider societal consequences of these measures. Some countries have begun to lift some of the rules on physical distancing in a stepwise manner, with differences in what these 'exit strategies' entail and their timeframes. The aim of this work was to inform such exit strategies by exploring the types of indoor and outdoor settings where transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to occur and result in clusters of cases. Identifying potential settings that result in transmission clusters allows these to be kept under close surveillance and/or to remain closed as part of strategies that aim to avoid a resurgence in transmission following the lifting of lockdown measures. Methods: We performed a systematic review of available literature and media reports to find settings reported in peer reviewed articles and media with these characteristics. These sources are curated and made available in an editable online database. Results: We found many examples of SARS-CoV-2 clusters linked to a wide range of mostly indoor settings. Few reports came from schools, many from households, and an increasing number were reported in hospitals and elderly care settings across Europe. Conclusions: We identified possible places that are linked to clusters of COVID-19 cases and could be closely monitored and/or remain closed in the first instance following the progressive removal of lockdown restrictions. However, in part due to the limits in surveillance capacities in many settings, the gathering of information such as cluster sizes and attack rates is limited in several ways: inherent recall bias, biased media reporting and missing data.","Leclerc, Quentin J.; Fuller, Naomi M.; Knight, Lisa E.; Funk, Sebastian; Knight, Gwenan M.",Wellcome Open Res.,227,22

Psychological health seems to be a controversial determinant of vaccine hesitancy and remains to be investigated. This study attempted to measure parental psychological distress, attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine, and to explore the potential associations. METHODS: An online survey using convenience sampling method was conducted among parents within the school public health network of Shenzhen. Demographic information and attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination were collected. The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-4) was applied to measure psychological distress. RESULTS: Overall, 4,748 parents were included (average age: 40.28, standard deviation: 5.08). More than one fifth of them demonstrated psychological distress, in which only 3.3% were moderate to severe symptom. The proportions of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy for themselves, their spouses, and their children were 25.2%, 26.1%, and 27.3%, respectively. Parents with psychological distress were more likely to suffer vaccine hesitancy for themselves (OR: 1.277, 95%CI: 1.091~1.494), for their spouses (OR:1.276, 95%CI: 1.088~1.496) and children (OR:1.274, 95%CI: 1.092~1.486). These associations tended to be more significant among parents with mild or severe psychological distress. LIMITATION: Non-random sampling limited the generalization of our findings to all parents. CONCLUSION: Parents had a low level of psychological distress but relatively high willingness of COVID-19 vaccination when there was no local epidemic but persistent risk of imported cases. Targeted health education and intervention strategies should be provided to people with vaccine hesitancy, especially for those who are susceptible to psychological distress.","Xu, Yucheng; Zhang, Ruiyin; Zhou, Zhifeng; Fan, Jingjie; Liang, Jing; Cai, Lin; Peng, Lin; Ren, Fangmei; Lin, Wei",J Affect Disord,227,15

Emerging data related to mechanism of severity and potential therapies for patients presenting with severe symptoms are scattered and therefore require a comprehensive analysis to focus research on developing effective therapeutics.

Here, we present the outcomes of our COVID-19 BCP and its impact on the Victorian NBS laboratory service. METHODS: Change management principles were used to develop a BCP that included mapping of NBS processes against staff resources, triaging priorities, technology solutions, supply chain continuity, gap analysis, and supporting maternity service providers. The effect was assessed quantitatively by review of key performance indicator data and qualitatively from staff feedback. RESULTS: A four-stage BCP was implemented. Stage 1 split teams into two, which rotated weekly, onsite (laboratory) and offsite (home). At 20 weeks post-implementation the BCP only progressed to stage 1 and the overall turnaround time was maintained. Staff experience indicated benefits from the review of workflow but noted some social impact associated with the change. CONCLUSION: The preparedness and agility of implementation was based on our focus on the newborn babies and their families, our production system, and a continuous improvement mindset. Both our people and technology infrastructure processes are crucial to this success as we continue to adapt to new challenges.","Greaves, Ronda F; Pitt, James; McGregor, Candice; Wall, Meaghan; Christodoulou, John",Genet. med,227,16

The corresponding molecular pathways switch from oxidative phosphorylation to aerobic glycolysis, due to changes in glucose degradation mechanisms known as the 'Warburg reprogramming' of cancer cells. Key glycolytic enzymes, glucose transporters and transcription factors involved in the Warburg transformation are frequently dysregulated during carcinogenesis considered as promising diagnostic and prognostic markers as well as treatment targets. Flavonoids are molecules with pleiotropic activities. The metabolism-regulating anticancer effects of flavonoids are broadly demonstrated in preclinical studies. Flavonoids modulate key pathways involved in the Warburg phenotype including but not limited to PKM2, HK2, GLUT1 and HIF-1. The corresponding molecular mechanisms and clinical relevance of 'anti-Warburg' effects of flavonoids are discussed in this review article.

Objective: The objective of the study to describe the clinical features of COVID-19 patients diagnosed in a tertiary-care center in Mexico City and to assess differences according to the treatment setting (ambulatory vs. hospital) and to the need of intensive care (IC). Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort, including consecutive patients with COVID-19 from February 26, 2020 to April 11, 2020. Results: We identified 309 patients (140 inpatients and 169 outpatients). The median age was 43 years (interquartile range, 33-54), 59.2% men, and 18.6% healthcare workers (12.3% from our center). The median body mass index (BMI) was 29.00 kg/m2 and 39.6% had obesity. Compared to outpatients, inpatients were older, had comorbidities, cough, and dyspnea more frequently. Twenty-nine (20.7%) inpatients required treatment in the IC unit (ICU). History of diabetes (type 1 or 2) and abdominal pain were more common in ICU patients compared to non-ICU patients. ICU patients had higher BMIs, higher respiratory rates, and lower room-air capillary oxygen saturations. ICU patients showed a more severe inflammatory response as assessed by white blood cell count, neutrophil and platelet count, C-reactive protein, ferritin, procalcitonin, and albumin levels. By the end of the study period, 65 inpatients had been discharged because of improvement, 70 continued hospitalized, and five had died.

The maize stem is one of the most important parts of the plant and is also a component of many agronomic traits in maize. This study aimed to advance our understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying maize stem traits. A recombinant inbred line (RIL) population derived from a cross between Ye478 and Qi319 was used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) controlling stem height (SH), ear height (EH), stem node number (SN), ear node (EN), and stem diameter (SD), and two derived traits (ear height coefficient (EHc) and ear node coefficient (ENc)). Using an available ultra-high density bin map, 46 putative QTL for these traits were detected on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 10. Individual QTL explained 3.5-17.7% of the phenotypic variance in different environments. Two QTL for SH, three for EH, two for EHc, one for SN, one for EN, and one for SD were detected in more than one environment. QTL with pleiotropic effects or multiple linked QTL were also identified on chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 10, which are potential target regions for fine-mapping and marker-assisted selection in maize breeding programs. Further, we discussed segregation of bin markers (mk1630 and mk4452) associated with EHc QTL in the RIL population. We had identified two putative WRKY DNA-binding domain proteins, AC209050.3_FG003 and GRMZM5G851490, and a putative auxin response factor, GRMZM2G437460, which might be involved in regulating plant growth and development, as candidate genes for the control of stem architecture.","Shang, Qiqi; Zhang, Degui; Li, Rong; Wang, Kaixin; Cheng, Zimeng; Zhou, Zhiqiang; Hao, Zhuanfang; Pan, Jinbao; Li, Xinhai; Shi, Liyu",Plant mol. biol,227,6

Additionally, authories had no proven experience with applying insufficient medical, communication and crisis management tools. For a considerable period of time, the actual number of people infected was unknown. There were great uncertainties regarding the dynamics and spread of the Covid-19 virus infection. In this paper, we develop a system dynamics model for the three connected regions (Wuhan, Hubei excl. Wuhan, China excl. Hubei) to understand the infection and spread dynamics of the virus and provide a more accurate estimate of the number of infected people in Wuhan and discuss the necessity and effectivity of protective measures against this epidemic, such as the quarantines imposed throughout China. We use the statistics of confirmed cases of China excl. Hubei. Also the daily data on travel activity within China was utilized, in order to determine the actual numerical development of the infected people in Wuhan City and Hubei Province. We used a multivariate Monte Carlo optimization to parameterize the model to match the official statistics. In particular, we used the model to calculate the infections, which had already broken out, but were not diagnosed for various reasons.","Hu, Bo; Dehmer, Matthias; Emmert-Streib, Frank; Zhang, Bo",PLoS One,227,23

To gain the systems level understanding of the role of global transmission routes in the COVID-19 spread, in this study, we have developed the first, empirical, global, index-case transmission network of SARS-CoV-2 termed as C19-TraNet. We manually curated the travel history of country wise index-cases using government press releases, their official social media handles and online news reports to construct this C19-TraNet that is a spatio-temporal, sparse, growing network comprising of 187 nodes and 199 edges and follows a power-law degree distribution. To model the growing C19-TraNet, a novel stochastic scale free (SSF) algorithm is proposed that accounts for stochastic addition of both nodes as well as edges at each time step. A peculiar connectivity pattern in C19-TraNet is observed, characterized by a fourth degree polynomial growth curve, that significantly diverges from the average random connectivity pattern obtained from an ensemble of its 1,000 SSF realizations. Partitioning the C19-TraNet, using edge betweenness, it is found that most of the large communities are comprised of a heterogeneous mixture of countries belonging to different world regions suggesting that there are no spatial constraints on the spread of disease. This work characterizes the superspreaders that have very quickly transported the virus, through multiple transmission routes, to long range geographical locations alongwith their local neighborhoods.","Singh, Vikram",,227,16

In this regard, the case of the Italian vaccination debate is particularly worrying given that Italy has been one of the European countries with the highest number of measles cases in the recent past. According to this scenario, we conducted a cross-sectional study on a convenience sample of Italian university students aimed at: (1) exploring their attitudes towards a future vaccine to prevent COVID-19 and; (2) evaluating the impact of the university curricula (healthcare vs. non-healthcare curricula) on the intention to vaccinate. Descriptive analysis on the 735 students that answered to the question on the intention to vaccinate showed that 633 (86.1%) students reported that they would choose to have a vaccination for the COVID-19 coronavirus; on the other side, 102 (13.9%) students reported that they would not or be not sure to vaccine (low intention to vaccinate). This means that in our sample more than one student out of 10 shows low intention to vaccinate (vaccine hesitancy). Furthermore, when running analysis comparing healthcare students versus non-healthcare students we found no significant differences in responses' percentage distribution (p = .097). Understanding the student's perspective about the future COVID-19 vaccine and supporting their health engagement and consciousness may be useful in planning adequate response and multidisciplinary educational strategies-including the psychological perspective on vaccine hesitancy underlying factors - in the post-pandemic period.","Barello, Serena; Nania, Tiziana; Dellafiore, Federica; Graffigna, Guendalina; Caruso, Rosario",Eur J Epidemiol,227,16

This essay proposes that his work is both a manifestation of that history and a complex response to it in its content, and, particularly, in its form. In Aesthetic Theory, Theodore Adorno proposes that ‘the unsolved antagonisms of reality return in artworks as immanent problems of form’ (7). Exemplifying Adorno's proposition that ‘aesthetic form is sedimented context’ (9) Beckett's work remains disruptive of Western late capital commodification through the restatement of historical antagonisms that involve characters having to choose between privilege and impoverishment, quietism and protest, and being and its obliteration. The result is a body of work that continues to present, for its readers’ consideration, the parameters of a politics of choice which are repeatedly instantiated by the traces of the tumultuous history the work carries within itself. As the decisions facing Beckett's characters reflected those faced by late twentieth century European society, so too his work now resonates in the present moment as the contemporary world struggles in the shadow of neo-liberal capitalism and COVID-19. © Journal of Beckett Studies.","Sharkey, R.",Journal of Beckett Studies,227,1

The potential individual health effects of long-term isolation are largely unknown. The current study investigated the arrhythmic consequences of the COVID-19 lockdown in patients with defibrillators (ICDs) living in the province of Ferrara, Italy. METHODS: Both the arrhythmias and the delivered ICD therapies as notified by the devices were prospectively collected during the lockdown period (P1) and compared to those occurred during the 10 weeks before the lockdown began (P2) and during the same period in 2019 (P3). Changes in outcome over the three study periods were evaluated for significance using McNemar's test. RESULTS: A total of 413 patients were included in the analysis. No differences were found concerning either arrhythmias or shocks or anti-tachycardia pacing. Only the number of patients experiencing non-sustained ventricular tachycardias (NSVTs) during P1 significantly decreased as compared to P2 (p = 0.026) and P3 (p = 0.009). The subgroup analysis showed a significant decrease in NSVTs during P1 for men (vs. P2, p = 0.014; vs. P3, p = 0.040) and younger patients (vs. P2, p = 0.002; vs. P3, p = 0.040) and for ischemic etiology (vs. P2, p = 0.003). No arrhythmic deaths occurred during P1. CONCLUSIONS: The complete nationwide lockdown, as declared by the Italian government during the first COVID-19 pandemic peak, did not impact on the incidence of arrhythmias in an urban cohort of patients with ICDs.","Sassone, Biagio; Virzì, Santo; Bertini, Matteo; Pasanisi, Giovanni; Manzoli, Lamberto; Myers, Jonathan; Grazzi, Giovanni; Muser, Daniele",Pacing clin. electrophysiol,227,16

Previous studies reported that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 1 and Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus infections may affect the gastrointestinal (GI) system. In this review we outline the important GI manifestations of COVID-19 and discuss the possible underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and their diagnosis and management. GI manifestations are reported in 11.4-61.1% of individuals with COVID-19, with variable onset and severity. The majority of COVID-19-associated GI symptoms are mild and self-limiting and include anorexia, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain/discomfort. A minority of patients present with an acute abdomen with aetiologies such as acute pancreatitis, acute appendicitis, intestinal obstruction, bowel ischaemia, haemoperitoneum or abdominal compartment syndrome. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 RNA has been found in biopsies from all parts of the alimentary canal. Involvement of the GI tract may be due to direct viral injury and/or an inflammatory immune response and may lead to malabsorption, an imbalance in intestinal secretions and gut mucosal integrity and activation of the enteric nervous system. Supportive and symptomatic care is the mainstay of therapy. However, a minority may require surgical or endoscopic treatment for acute abdomen and GI bleeding.","Kariyawasam, Jayani C; Jayarajah, Umesh; Riza, Rishdha; Abeysuriya, Visula; Seneviratne, Suranjith L",Trans.

The present study aims to examine for the first time the emotional impact of the quarantine on children and adolescents from Italy and Spain, two of the countries most affected by COVID-19. Participants were 1,143 parents of Italian and Spanish children aged 3 to 18 years who completed a survey providing information about how the quarantine affects their children and themselves, compared to before the home confinement. Results show that 85.7% of the parents perceived changes in their children's emotional state and behaviors during the quarantine. The most frequent symptoms were difficulty concentrating (76.6%), boredom (52%), irritability (39%), restlessness (38.8%), nervousness (38%), feelings of loneliness (31.3%), uneasiness (30.4%), and worries (30.1%). Spanish parents reported more symptoms than Italians. As expected, children of both countries used monitors more frequently, spent less time doing physical activity, and slept more hours during the quarantine. Furthermore, when family coexistence during quarantine became more difficult, the situation was more serious, and the level of stress was higher, parents tended to report more emotional problems in their children. The quarantine impacts considerably on Italian and Spanish youth, reinforcing the need to detect children with problems as early as possible to improve their psychological well-being.","Orgilés, Mireia; Morales, Alexandra; Delvecchio, Elisa; Mazzeschi, Claudia; Espada, José P",Front Psychol,227,1

Here, we study the binding of two SARS-CoV-2-like viruses isolated from pangolins, GX/P2V/2017 and GD/1/2019, to human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), the receptor of SARS-CoV-2. We find that the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) of pangolin CoVs binds to hACE2 as efficiently as the SARS-CoV-2 RBD in vitro. Furthermore, incorporation of pangolin CoVs RBDs allows entry of pseudotyped VSV particles into hACE2-expressing cells. A screen for binding of pangolin CoV RBDs to ACE2 orthologs from various species suggests a broader host range than that of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, cryo-EM structures of GX/P2V/2017 and GD/1/2019 RBDs in complex with hACE2 show their molecular binding in modes similar to SARS-CoV-2 RBD. Introducing the Q498H substitution found in pangolin CoVs into the SARS-CoV-2 RBD expands its binding capacity to ACE2 homologs of mouse, rat and European hedgehog. These findings suggest that these two pangolin CoVs may infect humans, highlighting the necessity of further surveillance of pangolin CoVs.","Niu, Sheng; Wang, Jia; Bai, Bin; Wu, Lili; Zheng, Anqi; Chen, Qian; Du, Pei; Han, Pengcheng; Zhang, Yanfang; Jia, Yunfei; Qiao, Chengpeng; Qi, Jianxun; Tian, Wen-Xia; Wang, Hong-Wei; Wang, Qihui; Fu Gao, George",EMBO J,227,1

Moreover, the rapid onset of societal disruption and evolving regulatory restrictions may not have allowed for systematic planning of how clinical and research work may continue throughout the pandemic or be restarted as restrictions are abated. The urgency to provide and develop NIBS as an intervention for diverse neurological and mental health indications, and as a catalyst of fundamental brain research, is not dampened by the parallel efforts to address the most life-threatening aspects of COVID-19; rather in many cases the need for NIBS is heightened including the potential to mitigate mental health consequences related to COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: To facilitate the re-establishment of access to NIBS clinical services and research operations during the current COVID-19 pandemic and possible future outbreaks, we develop and discuss a framework for balancing the importance of NIBS operations with safety considerations, while addressing the needs of all stakeholders. We focus on Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and low intensity transcranial Electrical Stimulation (tES) - including transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) and transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation (tACS). METHODS: The present consensus paper provides guidelines and good practices for managing and reopening NIBS clinics and laboratories through the immediate and ongoing stages of COVID-19. The document reflects the analysis of experts with domain-relevant expertise spanning NIBS technology, clinical services, and basic and clinical research - with an international perspective. We outline regulatory aspects, human resources, NIBS optimization, as well as accommodations for specific demographics. RESULTS: A model based on three phases (early COVID-19 impact, current practices, and future preparation) with an 11-step checklist (spanning removing or streamlining in-person protocols, incorporating telemedicine, and addressing COVID-19-associated adverse events) is proposed. Recommendations on implementing social distancing and sterilization of NIBS related equipment, specific considerations of COVID-19 positive populations including mental health comorbidities, as well as considerations regarding regulatory and human resource in the era of COVID-19 are outlined. We discuss COVID-19 considerations specifically for clinical (sub-)populations including pediatric, stroke, addiction, and the elderly. Numerous case-examples across the world are described. CONCLUSION: There is an evident, and in cases urgent, need to maintain NIBS operations through the COVID-19 pandemic, including anticipating future pandemic waves and addressing effects of COVID-19 on brain and mind. The proposed robust and structured strategy aims to address the current and anticipated future challenges while maintaining scientific rigor and managing risk.","Bikson, Marom; Hanlon, Colleen A; Woods, Adam J; Gillick, Bernadette T; Charvet, Leigh; Lamm, Claus; Madeo, Graziella; Holczer, Adrienn; Almeida, Jorge; Antal, Andrea; Ay, Mohammad Reza; Baeken, Chris; Blumberger, Daniel M; Campanella, Salvatore; Camprodon, Joan A; Christiansen, Lasse; Loo, Colleen; Crinion, Jennifer T; Fitzgerald, Paul; Gallimberti, Luigi; Ghobadi-Azbari, Peyman; Ghodratitoostani, Iman; Grabner, Roland H; Hartwigsen, Gesa; Hirata, Akimasa; Kirton, Adam; Knotkova, Helena; Krupitsky, Evgeny; Marangolo, Paola; Nakamura-Palacios, Ester M; Potok, Weronika; Praharaj, Samir K; Ruff, Christian C; Schlaug, Gottfried; Siebner, Hartwig R; Stagg, Charlotte J; Thielscher, Axel; Wenderoth, Nicole; Yuan, Ti-Fei; Zhang, Xiaochu; Ekhtiari, Hamed",Brain Stimul,227,1

Methods: We analysed clinical features in a cohort of 173 children with COVID-19 (0-15 yrs.-old) between January 22, 2020 and March 15, 2020. We systematically examined the expression and distribution of ACE2 in different developmental stages of children by using a combination of children's lung biopsies, pluripotent stem cell-derived lung cells, RNA-sequencing profiles, and ex vivo SARS-CoV-2 pseudoviral infections. Results: It revealed that infants (< 1yrs.-old), with a weaker potency of immune response, are more vulnerable to develop pneumonia whereas older children (> 1 yrs.-old) are more resistant to lung injury. The expression levels of ACE2 however do not vary by age in children's lung. ACE2 is notably expressed not only in Alveolar Type II (AT II) cells, but also in SOX9 positive lung progenitor cells detected in both pluripotent stem cell derivatives and infants' lungs. The ACE2+SOX9+ cells are readily infected by SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and the numbers of the double positive cells are significantly decreased in older children. Conclusions: Infants (< 1 yrs.-old) with SARS-CoV-2 infection are more vulnerable to lung injuries. ACE2 expression in multiple types of lung cells including SOX9 positive progenitor cells, in cooperation with an unestablished immune system, could be risk factors contributing to vulnerability of infants with COVID-19. There is a need to continue monitoring lung development in young children who have recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Zhang, Zhao; Guo, Liyan; Lu, Xiaoxia; Zhang, Che; Huang, Li; Wang, Xianfeng; Duan, Fuyu; Liang, Huiying; Chen, Peikai; Zeng, Liang; Shao, Jianbo; Li, Hui; Li, Le; Liu, Li; Li, Cheng; Zhang, Jinqiu; Ma, Chui Yan; Kwan, Ka Yi; Liu, Wei; Xu, Yi; Gu, Xiaoqiong; Jiang, Hua; Du, Hui; Zhang, Ting; Wu, Yanheng; Yu, Guangyin; Chen, Junhui; Luo, Ruibang; Liao, Can; Tse, Hung-Fat; Chen, Zhiwei; Chen, Huanhuan Joyce; Xia, Huimin; Lian, Qizhou",Theranostics,227,26

Long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) are particularly vulnerable to cluster outbreaks because facilities for patient isolation and healthcare personnel to care for these patients in isolation are difficult to arrange in a large outbreak situation. Although several drugs have been proposed as treatment options, there are no data on the effectiveness and safety of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for COVID-19. After a large COVID-19 exposure event in an LTCH in Korea, PEP using hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) was administered to 211 individuals, including 189 patients and 22 careworkers, whose baseline polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for COVID-19 were negative. PEP was completed in 184 (97.4%) patients and 21 (95.5%) careworkers without serious adverse events. At the end of 14 days of quarantine, all follow-up PCR tests were negative.

While being primarily public health related, it has a tremendous impact on many other aspects, including business management. Many businesses were forced to introduce rapid changes to their business models in order to survive. The aim of this paper is to show the complexity and interrelations of changes triggered by COVID-19 outbreak. Understanding of this complexity is crucial for developing business resilience to similar events in the future. The paper uses systems thinking approach to analyze influence of COVID-19 pandemic on business operations and to show the importance of the proper government response to the COVID-19 crisis. A causal loop diagram is used to show the complicated mechanisms behind the impact of pandemic on several aspects of business operation and management. Perceptions of some variables play more important roles than actual variables, and it often requires more than one actor to solve a particular problem. Adaptive business management may prove to be a particular challenge for small business owners. The paper provides useful insights into the complex nature of contemporary business operation and management in the wake of a major epidemiological crisis. It may contribute to a better understanding of important factors that often tend to be disregarded and not paid enough attention to. It offers food for thought not only for academics, but also to business owners/managers, aware of the complexity of contemporary world and to government-level decision-makers. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Zięba, K.",Knowledge and Process Management,227,20

While large-scale sequencing efforts have identified numerous genetic variants in SARS-CoV-2 during its circulation, it remains largely unclear whether many of these changes impact adaptation, replication, or transmission of the virus. Here, we characterized 14 different low-passage replication-competent human SARS-CoV-2 isolates representing all major European clades observed during the first pandemic wave in early 2020. By integrating viral sequencing data from patient material, virus stocks, and passaging experiments, together with kinetic virus replication data from nonhuman Vero-CCL81 cells and primary differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (BEpCs), we observed several SARS-CoV-2 features that associate with distinct phenotypes. Notably, naturally occurring variants in Orf3a (Q57H) and nsp2 (T85I) were associated with poor replication in Vero-CCL81 cells but not in BEpCs, while SARS-CoV-2 isolates expressing the Spike D614G variant generally exhibited enhanced replication abilities in BEpCs. Strikingly, low-passage Vero-derived stock preparation of 3 SARS-CoV-2 isolates selected for substitutions at positions 5/6 of E and were highly attenuated in BEpCs, revealing a key cell-specific function to this region. Rare isolate-specific deletions were also observed in the Spike furin cleavage site during Vero-CCL81 passage, but these were rapidly selected against in BEpCs, underscoring the importance of this site for SARS-CoV-2 replication in primary human cells. Overall, our study uncovers sequence features in SARS-CoV-2 variants that determine cell-specific replication and highlights the need to monitor SARS-CoV-2 stocks carefully when phenotyping newly emerging variants or potential variants of concern.","Pohl, Marie O; Busnadiego, Idoia; Kufner, Verena; Glas, Irina; Karakus, Umut; Schmutz, Stefan; Zaheri, Maryam; Abela, Irene; Trkola, Alexandra; Huber, Michael; Stertz, Silke; Hale, Benjamin G",PLoS Biol,227,29

The aim of this review was to study how often and to what extent COVID-19 causes myocardial injury and whether this is an important contributor to outcome with implications for management. METHODS: A literature search was performed in Medline and Embase. Myocardial injury was defined as elevated cardiac troponin (cTn) levels with at least one value >â¯99th percentile of the upper reference limit. The primary outcome measure was mortality, whereas secondary outcome measures were intensive care unit (ICU) admission and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Four studies and one review were included. The presence of myocardial injury varied between 9.6 and 46.3%. Myocardial injury was associated with a higher mortality rate (risk ratio (RR) 5.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.48-8.80) and more ICU admissions (RR 3.78, 95% CI 2.07-6.89). The results regarding length of hospital stay were inconclusive. CONCLUSION: Patients with myocardial injury might be classified as high-risk patients, with probably a higher mortality rate and a larger need for ICU admission. cTn levels can be used in risk stratification models and can indicate which patients potentially benefit from early medication administration. We recommend measuring cTn levels in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital or who deteriorate during admission.","Habets, M A W; Sturkenboom, H N; Tio, R A; Belfroid, E; Hoogervorst-Schilp, J; Siebelink, H J; Jansen, C W; Smits, P C",Neth Heart J,227,4

During the epidemic prevention and control period of COVID-19, non-contact approaches have great significance because they minimize the physical burden on the patient and have the least requirement of active cooperation of the infected individual. During the pandemic, these non-contact approaches also reduce environmental constraints and remove the need for extra preparations. According to the latest medical research, the breathing pattern of a person infected with COVID-19 is unlike the breathing associated with flu and the common cold. One noteworthy symptom that occurs in COVID-19 is an abnormal breathing rate; individuals infected with COVID-19 have more rapid breathing. This requires continuous real-time detection of breathing patterns, which can be helpful in the prediction, diagnosis, and screening for people infected with COVID-19. In this research work, software-defined radio (SDR)-based radio frequency (RF) sensing techniques and machine learning (ML) algorithms are exploited to develop a platform for the detection and classification of different abnormal breathing patterns. ML algorithms are used for classification purposes, and their performance is evaluated on the basis of accuracy, prediction speed, and training time. The results show that this platform can detect and classify breathing patterns with a maximum accuracy of 99.4% through a complex tree algorithm. This research has a significant clinical impact because this platform can also be deployed for practical use in pandemic and non-pandemic situations.","Rehman, Mubashir; Shah, Raza Ali; Khan, Muhammad Bilal; AbuAli, Najah Abed; Shah, Syed Aziz; Yang, Xiaodong; Alomainy, Akram; Imran, Muhmmad Ali; Abbasi, Qammer H",Sensors (Basel),227,16

We recently demonstrated that higher grief levels are experienced after COVID-19-related bereavement than natural bereavement. Death circumstances during the pandemic (e.g., reduced social support, limited opportunities for death rituals) may also hamper the grief process for non-COVID-19-related bereavement, yet no quantitative research has specifically addressed this issue. OBJECTIVES: To test if grief severity is higher during than before the lockdown after non-COVID-19-related bereavement. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey including questions on sociodemographic and loss-related variables and a grief measure was conducted among a sample of 1600 bereaved adults (78% females), participating before (n = 731) or during (n = 869) the pandemic, including people who had experienced a loss before the pandemic (n = 456) or during the pandemic (n = 200) recently (five months ago or less). RESULTS: No significant differences emerged between grief levels in people participating before or during the pandemic. However, being recently bereaved during the pandemic elicited more severe grief than before it (d = 0.17; d = 0.18). Effects remained significant after controlling analyses for relevant loss-related variables. CONCLUSION: Among all bereaved persons, grief severity was no different during the pandemic compared with before the pandemic. However, experiencing a recent loss during the pandemic elicited more severe acute grief reactions than before the pandemic, suggesting that dealing with loss may be more difficult during this ongoing health crisis.","Eisma, Maarten C; Tamminga, Aerjen",J Pain Symptom Manage,227,20

The subjects received desensitizing-containing hydrogen peroxide in half of the maxillary arch, and the other half received a desensitizing-free hydrogen peroxide, defined by random sequence, in two dental bleaching sessions. The bleaching sensitivity was evaluated during bleaching and from 1 h to 48 h after each bleaching session using a visual analog scale and numeric rating scale; the McNemar test, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, and the Student-Newman-Keuls test were used for statistical analysis. The color was measured at baseline and 30 days post-bleaching, evaluated with paired t tests (P = .05). RESULTS: Statistically similar risks of bleaching sensitivity were observed (P = 1.000), but the intensity of bleaching sensitivity was lower (P < .011) on average by 1.32 visual analog scale units in the group bleached with the desensitizer-containing gel during up to 24 h assessment times. No statistical difference in color change was observed between groups (P > .321). CONCLUSION: The incorporation of 5% potassium nitrate into in-office bleaching gels does not reduce the risk of bleaching sensitivity, but it reduces its intensity slightly without jeopardizing color change.","Maran, Bianca Medeiros; Vochikovski, Laína; Hortkoff, Diego Rafael de Andrade; Stanislawczuk, Rodrigo; Loguercio, Alessandro D; Reis, Alessandra",Quintessence Int,227,28

The studies on this policy include physical filtering tests with inanimate microparticles, randomized clinical trials, observational studies, ecological analyses, and even computational modeling of epidemics. Much of the so-called evidence is inferred from studies on different respiratory viruses and epidemiological settings. Heterogeneity is a major factor limiting the generalization of inferences. In this article, we reviewed the empirical and rational bases of mask use and how to understand these recommendations compared to other policies of social distancing, restrictions on non-essential services, and lockdown. We conclude that recent studies suggest a synergistic effect of the use of masks and social distancing rather than opposing effects of the two recommendations. Developing social communication approaches that clarify the need to combine different strategies is a challenge for public health authorities.","Fortaleza, Cristiane Ravagnani; Souza, Lenice do Rosário de; Rúgolo, Juliana Machado; Fortaleza, Carlos Magno Castelo Branco",Rev Soc Bras Med Trop,227,20

A unique finding among COVID-19 patients was a decline of eosinophil levels (eosinopenia). However, results from previous studies on the relationship between eosinopenia and disease severity were inconsistent. The objective of this study is to determine the relationship between eosinopenia and COVID-19 mortality as well as the clinical conditions that could potentially lead to mortality. Methods: One hundred ninety patients diagnosed as moderate, severe, or critical COVID-19 at hospital admission were enrolled. Data collected from patients' medical records on the second day after hospital admission included medical histories, clinical symptoms, chest images of computed tomography (CT), laboratory examinations, and outcomes. Results: Eosinophil levels were significantly lower in patients with critical disease, when compared to those with moderate and severe diseases. After controlled for confounding factors, i.e., age, gender, hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, and chronic lung disease, a progressive decline of eosinophil levels was independently associated with mortality. Moreover, eosinophil levels significantly and positively correlated with platelet and D-dimer levels but significantly and inversely correlated with serum levels of urea, creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase. Conclusions: Eosinopenia, if progressively worsening, indicates that COVID-19 patients may progress to critical disease and have a significantly higher chance of mortality. Additionally, eosinopenia correlates with biomarkers of coagulation disorder and those of tissue damage in kidney, liver, and other tissues.","Yan, Bingdi; Yang, Junling; Xie, Yan; Tang, Xiaolei",World Allergy Organ J,227,24

Globally, this pandemic has affected over 111 million individuals and posed many health and economic challenges. Much research effort is dedicated to discovering new treatments to address the associated challenges and restrict the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Since SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-strand RNA virus, its replication requires the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) enzyme. In this study, we report the discovery of new potential RdRp enzyme inhibitors based on computer modeling and simulation methodologies. The antiviral ZINC database was utilized for covalent docking virtual screening followed by molecular interaction analyses based on reported hot spots within the RdRp binding pocket (PDB: 7BV2). Eleven molecules, ZINC000014944915, ZINC000027556215, ZINC000013556344, ZINC000003589958, ZINC000003833965, ZINC000001642252, ZINC000028525778, ZINC000027557701, ZINC000013781295, ZINC000001651128 and ZINC000013473324, were shown to have the highest binding interactions. These molecules were further assessed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) studies. The results showed that all 11 molecules except ZINC000027557701 formed stable complexes with the viral RdRp and fell within the accepted ADMET parameters. The identified molecules can be used to design future potential RdRp inhibitors.","Ghazwani, Mohammed Y.; Bakheit, Ahmed H.; Hakami, Abdulrahim R.; Alkahtani, Hamad M.; Almehizia, Abdulrahman A.",Crystals,227,16

This systematic review evaluates the prevalence of antibiotic prescribing in patients admitted to ICUs with SARS-CoV-2 infection using PRISMA guidelines. We searched and scrutinized results from PubMed and ScienceDirect databases for published literature restricted to the English language up to 11 May 2021. In addition, we included observational studies of humans with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, clinical characteristics, and antibiotics prescribed for ICU patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections. A total of 361 studies were identified, but only 38 were included in the final analysis. Antibiotic prescribing data were available from 2715 patients, of which prevalence of 71% was reported in old age patients with a mean age of 62.7 years. From the reported studies, third generation cephalosporin had the highest frequency amongst reviewed studies (36.8%) followed by azithromycin (34.2%). The estimated bacterial infection in 12 reported studies was 30.8% produced by 15 different bacterial species, and S. aureus recorded the highest bacterial infection (75%). The fundamental outcomes were the prevalence of ICU COVID-19 patients prescribed antibiotics stratified by age, type of antibiotics prescribed, and the presence of co-infections and comorbidities.

Fifty-seven heifers were submitted to an ovulation synchronization protocol. This was followed by monitoring the heifers every 12 h over 60 h. Heifers were monitored for rectal and vaginal temperature using a digital thermometer. The surface temperature of the eye, vulva, and muzzle regions were monitored by IRT. Meteorological data was recorded for temperature and humidity. Observation of sexual behavior was performed to monitor estrus onset. Transrectal ultrasonography was used to identify the dominant follicle and confirm ovulation of all heifers. We observed a decrease in temperature of the rectum and vagina, as well as in the eye and vulva regions within the first 12 h after the completion of the synchronization. This period coincides with the expected proestrus phase of the estrous cycle. A progressive increase in all temperatures was noticed in the following 36 h, which coincides with the estrus phase of the reproductive cycle. The regions evaluated around the vulva and eye exhibited the highest temperature and experienced less environmental distortion than the muzzle area thermographs. Environmental factors, such as rainfall and temperature-humidity index, influenced the IRT readings altering the radiation patterns detected. In conclusion, IRT is an effective method to detect temperature variation during the proestrus and estrus phases in Gyr heifers. Furthermore, biological and environmental effects should be considered when collecting and interpreting IRT data in livestock.","Vicentini, Rogério R; Montanholi, Yuri R; Veroneze, Renata; Oliveira, André P; Lima, Maria L P; Ujita, Aska; El Faro, Lenira",J Therm Biol,227,26

In this scenario, evidence now suggests that epigenetics shapes endocrine functions, linking genetics and environment. During fertilization, spermatozoa share with the oocyte their epigenome, along with their haploid genome, in order to orchestrate embryo development. The epigenetic signature of spermatozoa is the result of a dynamic modulation of the epigenetic marks occurring, firstly, in the testis-during germ cell progression-then, along the epididymis, where spermatozoa still receive molecules, conveyed by epididymosomes. Paternal lifestyle, including nutrition and exposure to hazardous substances, alters the phenotype of the next generations, through the remodeling of a sperm epigenetic blueprint that dynamically reacts to a wide range of environmental and lifestyle stressors. With that in mind, this review will summarize and discuss insights into germline epigenetic plasticity caused by environmental stimuli and diet and how spermatozoa may be carriers of induced epimutations across generations through a mechanism known as paternal transgenerational epigenetic inheritance.","Cescon, Matilde; Chianese, Rosanna; Tavares, Renata S",,227,16

Rapid and accurate diagnostic tests are imperative for identifying and managing infected individuals, contact tracing, epidemiologic characterization, and public health decision making. Laboratory testing may be performed based on symptomatic presentation or for screening of asymptomatic people. Confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection is typically by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT), which requires specialized equipment and training and may be particularly challenging in resource-limited settings. NAAT may give false-negative results due to timing of sample collection relative to infection, improper sampling of respiratory specimens, inadequate preservation of samples, and technical limitations;false-positives may occur due to technical errors, particularly contamination during the manual real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) process. Thus, clinical presentation, contact history and contemporary phyloepidemiology must be considered when interpreting results. Several sample-to-answer platforms, including high-throughput systems and Point of Care (PoC) assays, have been developed to increase testing capacity and decrease technical errors. Alternatives to RT-PCR assay, such as other RNA detection methods and antigen tests may be appropriate for certain situations, such as resource-limited settings. While sequencing is important to monitor on-going evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 genome, antibody assays are useful for epidemiologic purposes. The ever-expanding assortment of tests, with varying clinical utility, performance requirements, and limitations, merits comparative evaluation. We herein provide a comprehensive review of currently available COVID-19 diagnostics, exploring their pros and cons as well as appropriate indications. Strategies to further optimize safety, speed, and ease of SARS-CoV-2 testing without compromising accuracy are suggested. Access to scalable diagnostic tools and continued technologic advances, including machine learning and smartphone integration, will facilitate control of the current pandemic as well as preparedness for the next one.","Mardian, Y.; Kosasih, H.; Karyana, M.; Neal, A.; Lau, C.

METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted among 470 multinational seafarers working on two oil tanker international shipping companies. Psychosocial distress was assessed by using Depression-Anxiety-Stress Scale (DASS-21). General Health Questionnaire-12 (GHQ-12) and Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) were used to assessed genral psychiatry disorders and self-rate anxiety. Perceived health status was assessed by a single-item question. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the association between demographic and work-related variables with mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Overall, 439 out of 470 invited seafarers with a mean age of 34.5 (SD: 8.05) participated in this study (participation rate: 93.4%). The prevalence (95% confidence interval) of depression, anxiety, stress, self-rated anxiety, general psychiatric disorders, and poor perceived health status was 12.3% (9.4-15.7), 11.6% (8.7-15.0), 5.9% (3.9-8.5), 2.1% (0.9-3.8), 42.6% (38.0-47.4), and 4.3% (2.6-6.6), respectively.

Interestingly, histological examination of the resected specimens revealed the diagnosis of a mixed-type intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm with a unique combination of gastric and pancreatobiliary subtypes. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, the combination of multiple histological subtypes of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms has been recorded in a few studies with reference to the challenging histological detection. Herein, we report a rare case with a significant histological combination, highlighting the difficulties in differential diagnosis due to the absence of ancillary techniques, with a brief review on diagnostic methods, histological characteristics and surgical recommendations.","Ismail, Sawsan; Darwisho, Rama; Ali, Mohammed; Haidar, Maen; Houreih, Mohammad Adib; Alshehabi, Zuheir",J Med Case Rep,227,20

The study was aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on post-graduate teaching and learning amongst candidates pursuing higher qualification in orthopaedics, in the Delhi-National Capital Region in India. Design: An online cross-sectional survey of 29 questions was circulated amongst post-graduate students pursuing higher orthopaedics degree to evaluate (i) Impact on PG teaching (ii) Impact on surgical training (iii) Impact on Dissertation (iv) Future implications on PG training programme (v) Mental wellbeing. Results: 138 (77.5) PG trainees contributed in the survey, and 65.1% of them stated that no clinical classes are being held presently. The majority (94%) confirmed that COVID-19 has affected their surgical and clinical training. A large number (71.6%) had problems in completing their dissertations and 96% had concerns about mental health. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic has severely disrupted the education and training of the Orthopaedic PG students, in Delhi-NCR region and perhaps elsewhere similarly too. The Government and Teaching organisations should take serious consideration of the plights of PGs and devise satisfactory mechanisms to overcome their problems and provide reasonable solutions also.","Upadhyaya, Gaurav Kumar; Jain, Vijay Kumar; Iyengar, Karthikeyan P; Patralekh, Mohit Kumar; Vaish, Abhishek",,227,20

Earlier reports have shown coagulopathy in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). MAIN SYMPTOMS AND IMPORTANT CLINICAL FINDINGS: We present four critically ill Covid-19 patients, who were admitted to our hospital. They were treated with supportive care, oral chloroquine, and standard 2500 or 5000 International Units (IU) of dalteparine subcutaneously once daily. Two patients died during the course of their stay as a consequence of severe large vessel arterial thromboembolism. The other two patients survived but symptoms of paralysis and aphasia persisted after cerebral ischemia due to large vessel arterial thromboembolism. Patients showed no signs of overt disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) in their laboratory analysis. CONCLUSION: This case series suggest that even in absence of overt DIC, arterial thromboembolic complications occur in critically ill patients with Covid-19. Further studies are needed to determine which parameters are useful in monitoring coagulopathy and which dose of anti-thrombotic therapy in Covid-19 patients is adequate, even when overt DIC is not present.","Lameijer, Joost R C; van Houte, Joris; van Berckel, Marijn M G; Canta, Leo R; Yo, Lonneke S F; Nijziel, Marten R; Krietemeijer, G M; Troquay, Stephanie A M; Buise, Marc P; Hendriks, Joris",J Crit Care,227,15

Therefore, we employ existing memetic theory to describe the qualities and characteristics of meme hoaxes in terms of the way they are replicated by altering some aspects of the original, and then shared on social media platforms in order to connect global and local issues. Criteria for selecting the sample were hoaxes retrieved from and related to the local territory in the province of Alicante (Spain) during the first year of the pandemic (n = 35). Once typology, hoax topics and their memetic qualities were identified, we analysed their characteristics according to form in terms of Shifman (2014) and, secondly, their content and stance concordances both within and outside our sample (Spain and abroad). The results show, firstly, that hoaxes are mainly disinformation and they are related to the pandemic. Secondly, despite the notion that local hoaxes are linked to local circumstances that are difficult to extrapolate, our conclusions demonstrate their extraordinary memetic and “glocal” capacity: they rapidly adapt other hoaxes from other places to local areas, very often supplanting reliable sources, and thereby demonstrating consistency and opportunism.","Rodríguez-Ferrándiz, Raúl Sánchez-Olmos Cande Hidalgo-Marí Tatiana Saquete-Boro Estela",Future Internet,227,21

A new quantifying reagent for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antigen was developed for early and accurate detection. We evaluated the novel quantitative reagent for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antigen using an automated laboratory device. METHODS: One-hundred nasopharyngeal samples were collected from 47 SARS-CoV-2-infected patients, and 200 samples were collected from healthy donners. We measured the SARS-CoV-2 antigen and nucleic acid using Lumipulse Presto SARS-CoV-2 Ag and the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Detection Kit, respectively. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the SARS-CoV-2 antigen test were 75.7% (56/74) and 96.0% (192/200), respectively. The concordance rate in the positive group between the antigen and nucleic acid tests was 66% (66/100). In addition, the correlation coefficient between the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 antigen and the level of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was 0.74. There were 19 discrepant samples in which SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected without SARS-CoV-2 antigen. There was significant difference between the discrepant and matched samples in terms of the time since symptom onset: the 19 discrepant samples were collected a median of 33 days after onset, while the 55 matched samples were collected a median of 19 days after onset. In addition, the 19 discrepant samples were collected from patients who were immune against SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: This novel SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection assay is highly sensitive, rapid, accurate, easily diagnostic. It may be useful in both clinical diagnosis and in screening because it does not require special methods such as PCR.","Kobayashi, Ryo; Murai, Ryosei; Asanuma, Koichi; Fujiya, Yoshihiro; Takahashi, Satoshi",J. infect. chemother,227,16

The aim of this study was to examine patients with IBD's adherence to the restrictions imposed by society and the hospital, worries and concerns regarding medical treatment and clinical follow-up under the pandemic. METHODS: IBD patients (&#8805;18 years) at the outpatient clinic at Oslo University Hospital were included and answered a self-report questionnaire including concerns regarding their disease, medical therapy and follow-up during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. RESULTS: In total, 522 IBD patients were included, 317 Crohn's disease, 205 ulcerative colitis, 386 patients <50 years. Eighteen percent were in obligatory quarantine, and more often patients <50 years compared to patients &#8805;50 years. Five patients tested positive to SARS- CoV-2. A higher proportion <50 years reported worries for their medical treatment and risk of COVID -19 disease compared to those &#8805;50 years. Forty percent avoided family, two-thirds avoided friends, and 4% cancelled their scheduled consultation at the hospital. The hospital changed physical consultation to telephone consultation for 15% of the patients. The preferred follow-up was physical consultation. A higher proportion of the patients <50 years preferred telephone consultation compared to those &#8805;50 years. Four out of five IBD patients were satisfied with the information about their IBD and COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 pandemic affects the daily lives for patients with IBD.

STUDY DESIGN: The study design is an observational study of consecutive COVID-19 cases that were treated in Mexican healthcare units and hospitals between February 27 and April 27, 2020. METHODS: Epidemiological, clinical and sociodemographic data were analysed from outpatients and hospitalised patients. Cox regression models were used to analyse the risk of mortality after severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. RESULTS: In total, 15,529 patients with COVID-19 were characterised; 62.6% of patients were aged older than 40 years, 57.8% were men and 1.4% were of indigenous ethnicity. A high proportion had a history of diabetes (18.4%), hypertension (21.9%) and obesity (20.9%). Among hospitalised patients, 11.2% received health care in the intensive care unit. Advanced age, male sex, indigenous ethnicity and having a history of chronic diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity, were significantly associated with a high risk of death after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Diabetes and obesity were the comorbidities most highly associated with death through the models used in this study. Moreover, living in Mexico City and Mexico State (where there is easy access to medical services) and walking (rather than driving or getting public transport) were negatively associated with mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection. CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes, hypertension and obesity combined with older age, male sex and indigenous ethnicity increase the risk of death after SARS-CoV-2 infection in the Mexican population. It is recommended that the incidence of COVID-19 is monitored in indigenous communities, and access to health services is increased nationwide.","Prado-Galbarro, F-J; Sanchez-Piedra, C; Gamiño-Arroyo, A E; Cruz-Cruz, C",Public Health,227,20

University students in China have been the first to go through the whole semester's ERT including College English, a compulsory language course for almost all the first- and second-year students of non-English majors. This article adopted a mixed-methods design, a survey followed by a qualitative visual method, gathered data on students' experience about ERT of College English and presented an investigation into detailed interactive process of the classes. The data analysis on the learners' engagement and the feedback from the learners provided a summary of the key threads of ERT classes. This study demonstrated that students held an extrinsic goal orientation, which did not differ from their face-to-face learning experience. ERT granted students more opportunities for interaction with their instructor and peers, while collaboration among students were limited. The research results can be connected to the larger fabric of global language teaching in crisis context, provide empirical lessons to educators, and help instructors with their future decision-making about technology-supported activities.","Huang, M.; Shi, Y.

The proportion of participants alive and off invasive mechanical ventilation at study day 28 (ventilator-free days (VFDs) at 28 days) is substantially lower in patients with superinfection (subhazard ratio 0.37, 95%-CI 0.15-0.90, p=0.028). Patients with pulmonary superinfections have a higher incidence of bacteraemia, virus reactivations, yeast colonization, and required intensive care treatment for a longer time. Superinfections are frequent and associated with reduced VFDs at 28 days despite a high rate of empirical antibiotic therapy.","Buehler, Philipp K; Zinkernagel, Annelies S; Hofmaenner, Daniel A; Wendel Garcia, Pedro David; Acevedo, Claudio T; Gómez-Mejia, Alejandro; Shambat, Srikanth Mairpady; Andreoni, Federica; Maibach, Martina A; Bartussek, Jan; Hilty, Matthias P; Frey, Pascal M; Schuepbach, Reto A; Brugger, Silvio D",Cell Rep Med,227,1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The first COVID-19 case was diagnosed in Turkey on 11 March, 2020, and the peak phase seemed to end by the end of April. All the patients whom were referred, treated, or previously operated but still at the hospital during the peak phase of COVID-19 pandemics in the country were included into this retrospective study. Patient's diagnosis, interventions, adverse events, and early post-procedural courses were studied. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients with various diagnoses of congenital cardiovascular disorders were retrospectively reviewed. Ages of the patients ranged between 2 days and 16 years. Seventeen cases were males and 14 cases were females. Elective cases were postponed. Priority was given to interventional procedures, and five cases were treated percutaneously. Palliative procedures were preferred in patients whom presumably would require long hospital stay. Corrective procedures were not hesitated in prioritised stable patients. Mortality occurred in one patient. Eight patients out of 151 ICU admissions were diagnosed with COVID-19, and they were transferred to COVID-19 ICU immediately. Three nurses whom also took care of the paediatric cases became infected with SARS-CoV-2; however, the children did not catch the disease. CONCLUSION: Mandatory and emergent congenital cardiac percutaneous and surgical procedures may be performed with similar postoperative risks as there are no pandemics with meticulous care and preventive measures.","Ugurlucan, Murat; Yildiz, Yahya; Oztas, Didem Melis; Coban, Senay; Beyaz, Metin Onur; Sari, Gizem; Ulukan, Mustafa Ozer; Karakaya, Atalay; Vatansever, Binay; Erkanli, Korhan; Meric, Mert; Unal, Orcun; Demirkol, Demet; Yozgat, Yilmaz; Saritas, Turkay; Erdem, Abdullah; Akdeniz, Celal; Turkoglu, Halil",Cardiol Young,227,1

To fight against COVID-19 in a more efficient way, drug-drug or drug-herb combinations are frequently used in clinical settings. The concomitant use of multiple medications may trigger clinically relevant drug/herb-drug interactions. This study aims to assay the inhibitory potentials of Qingfei Paidu decoction (QPD, a Chinese medicine compound formula recommended for combating COVID-19 in China) against human drug-metabolizing enzymes and to assess the pharmacokinetic interactions in vivo. The results demonstrated that QPD dose-dependently inhibited CYPs1A, 2A6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 and 2E1 but inhibited CYP3A in a time- and NADPH-dependent manner. In vivo test showed that QPD prolonged the half-life of lopinavir (a CYP3A substrate-drug) by 1.40-fold and increased the AUC of lopinavir by 2.04-fold, when QPD (6 g/kg) was co-administrated with lopinavir (160 mg/kg) to rats. Further investigation revealed that Fructus Aurantii Immaturus (Zhishi) in QPD caused significant loss of CYP3A activity in NADPH-generating system. Collectively, our findings revealed that QPD potently inactivated CYP3A and significantly modulated the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A substrate-drugs, which would be very helpful for the patients and clinicians to avoid potential drug-interaction risks in COVID-19 treatment.","Zhang, Feng; Huang, Jian; Liu, Wei; Wang, Chao-Ran; Liu, Yan-Fang; Tu, Dong-Zhu; Liang, Xin-Miao; Yang, Ling; Zhang, Wei-Dong; Chen, Hong-Zhuan; Ge, Guang-Bo",Food Chem Toxicol,227,16

The debate includes claims that sheltering in place influences deaths unrelated to infection or other natural causes. Testing this claim should improve the benefit/cost accounting that informs choice on reimposing sheltering in place. We use time-series methods to compare weekly non-natural deaths in California to those in Florida. California was the first state to begin, and among the last to end, sheltering in place while sheltering began later and ended earlier in Florida. During weeks when California had shelter-in-place orders in effect, but Florida did not, the odds that a non-natural death occurred in California rather than Florida were 14.4% below expected levels. Sheltering-in-place policies likely reduce mortality from mechanisms unrelated to infection or other natural causes of death.","Catalano, Ralph; Glymour, M Maria; Chen, Yea-Hung; Bibbins-Domingo, Kirsten",Am. j. epidemiol,227,24

Research is limited on how to support preference communication while using existing preference assessment tools (e.g., the Minimum Data Set 3.0). METHODS: This study examined the effect of two assessment conditions (standard verbal; visual-and-text supported;) on residents' (N = 21) social and leisure preference consistency over 1-week and utterance types (acknowledgment, elaboration, off-topic, request for clarification) in response to preference questions. Residents with severe dementia were recruited from four nursing homes (n = 11) and three assisted living facilities (n = 10). As a preliminary measure of provider acceptability and social validity, a sample of 10 naïve judges (University students) listened to the interviews and rated residents' communication clarity and their confidence with understanding residents' preferences. RESULTS: Neither assessment condition promoted significantly greater levels of consistency (i.e., the same preference rating at Time 1 and Time 2). Residents expressed significantly fewer requests for clarification in the visual-and-text supported condition. Naïve judges rated residents' communication positively, with no significant differences between conditions. CONCLUSIONS: This study addresses a gap in current research and holds important implications for enhancing care planning participation by residents with severe dementia. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Residents with severe dementia can successfully participate in activity preference discussions without proxy participation. Residents may comprehend interview questions better when provided in a supported format.","Burshnic, Vanessa L; Bourgeois, Michelle S",Clin Gerontol,227,2

The digital thematic maps and diagrams have been depicted by Grapher 13 and Arc GIS 10.3 platforms. The result shows that the pollutants like CO, NO2 and SO2 are significantly decreased, while the average level of O3 has been slightly increased in 2020 during the lockdown due to close-down of all industrial and transport activities. Meanwhile, around 17.5% was the mean reduction of PM10 and PM2.5 during lockdown compared with previous years owing to complete stop of vehicles movement, burning of biomass and dust particles from the construction works.

The consequences could be even more severe for those more vulnerable to the disease, such as the elderly and those with underlying health conditions. Indeed, there is evidence that such vulnerable populations are disproportionately affected in terms of both, their health and the socioeconomic impact. The aim of our study was to determine whether occupational health (OH) professionals thought that the COVID-19 pandemic might further disadvantage any particular group(s) of vulnerable workers globally, and if so, which group(s). A cross-sectional study was carried out with a sample of OH professionals by means of an online questionnaire which was shared via email within the ICOH (International Commission for Occupational Health) community. Data was collected over a period of two weeks in May 2020 and 165 responses from 52 countries were received. In this paper, the responses relating to questions about vulnerable workers are reported and discussed. Globally, our responders felt that those in less secure jobs (precarious employment (79%) and informal work (69%)), or unemployed (63%), were the most at risk of further disadvantage from this pandemic. The majority felt that their governments could act to mitigate these effects. There were suggestions of short-term alleviation such as financial and social support, as well as calls for fundamental reviews of the underlying inequalities that leave populations so vulnerable to a crisis such as COVID-19.","Tamin, Jacques; Samuel, Oluranti; Suraya, Anna; Ebuenyi, Ikenna D; Naicker, Nisha; Rajput-Ray, Minha",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),227,1

The ability of our cells to secrete type I interferons (IFN-Is) is essential for the control of virus replication and for effective antiviral immune responses; for this reason, viruses have evolved the means to antagonize IFN-I. Inhibition of IFN-I production is pronounced in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which can impair the adaptive immune response and exacerbate inflammatory disease at late stages of infection. However, therapeutic boosting of IFN-I offers a narrow time window for efficacy and safety. Here, we discuss how limits placed on IFN-I by SARS-CoV-2 shape the immune response and whether this might be countered with therapeutic approaches and vaccine design.","King, Cecile; Sprent, Jonathan",Trends Immunol,227,15

Cub domain-containing protein 1 (CDCP1), a cell-surface protein that confers poor prognosis of patients with certain solid tumors, was recently identified as one of the most significantly upregulated genes in SARS-CoV-2-infected children who developed systemic vasculitis, a hallmark of KD. However, a potential role of CDCP1 in KD has not previously been explored. In this study, we found that CDCP1 knockout (KO) mice exhibited attenuated coronary and aortic vasculitis and decreased serum Candida albicans water-soluble fraction (CAWS)-specific IgM/IgG2a and IL-6 concentrations compared with wild-type mice in an established model of KD induced by CAWS administration. CDCP1 expression was not detectable in cardiomyocytes, cardio fibroblasts, or coronary endothelium, but constitutive expression of CDCP1 was observed on dendritic cells (DCs) and was upregulated by CAWS stimulation. CAWS-induced IL-6 production was significantly reduced in CDCP1 KO DCs, in association with impaired Syk-MAPK signaling pathway activation. These novel findings suggest that CDCP1 might regulate KD development by modulating IL-6 production from DCs via the Syk-MAPK signaling pathway.","Lun, Yu; Borjini, Nozha; Miura, Noriko N; Ohno, Naohito; Singer, Nora G; Lin, Feng",J. immunol,227,1

They often need help from family members and friends to provide comprehensive care. When death occurs, funerals and other death-related rituals bring family and communities together to honor the life and mourn the death of a loved one and provide needed support to family and caregivers. These collective rituals are often deeply rooted in culturally-bound values and can facilitate grief and help make sense about loss. Rituals act as bridge-building activities that allow people to organize and appraise emotions, information, and actions after a loss. With the emergence of the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the recommended restrictions to reduce infection and transmission, family members and caregivers are often faced with weighing options for honored rituals to help them grieve. Grieving during the pandemic has become disorganized. The purpose of this article is to provide case managers and other clinical staff with recommendations on guiding caregivers/families through safety precautions when a loved one dies either because of a life-limiting illness or from COVID-19 during the pandemic using guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The authors also present information about complicated grief and ways to support coping with death and suggest safe alternatives to traditional death-related rituals and funerals in a COVID-19 era. PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING(S): Primary practice settings include home health care, hospice, hospital discharge planning, case management, and primary care. FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: Precautions necessary in a COVID-19 era may add anxiety and stress to an already difficult situation of caring for loved ones at end-of-life and grieving with their loss. Utilization of CDC guidelines lessens the risk of infection while honoring loved ones' wishes and cultural traditions surrounding death and burial. Recognition of social and spiritual connections that comfort mourners must also be considered.

Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have shown promise in antagonizing this microorganism in liquid media. However, the ecological relationships differ when cells are forming biofilms. In this work, we propose the use of Lactobacillus biofilms as surface ""conditioners"" to modulate the adhesion of L. monocytogenes. For this, the biofilm formation ability of Lactobacillus fermentum MP26 and Lactobacillus salivarius MP14 (human milk origin), fluorescently labeled by transfer of the mCherry-encoding pRCR12 plasmid, was first evaluated. Then, mature biofilms of these strains transformed with pRCR12 for expressing the fluorescent protein mCherry were used as adhesion substrate for GFP-tagged L. monocytogenes Scott A. The resulting biofilms were studied in terms of cellular population and attached biomass (cells plus matrix). Species distribution inside the biofilm structure was revealed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). Although none of the Lactobacillus spp. strains reduced the adhesion of L. monocytogenes Scott A, species interactions seem to interfere with the synthesis of extracellular polymeric substances and species distribution inside the biofilms. In dual-species biofilms, CLSM images revealed that Lactobacillus cells were trapping those of L. monocytogenes Scott A. When surfaces were conditioned with Lactobacillus biofilms, the spatial distribution of L. monocytogenes Scott A cells was species-specific, suggesting these interactions are governing the ultimate biofilm structure. The results here obtained open new possibilities for controlling L. monocytogenes dispersal using these Lactobacillus spp. biofilms as a ""natural"" immobilization way. Whether species interactions could modify the virulence of L. monocytogenes still remains unclear.","Jara, Josué; Pérez-Ramos, Adrián; Del Solar, Gloria; Rodríguez, Juan M; Fernández, Leónides; Orgaz, Belén",Int J Food Microbiol,227,10

The aim of this study was to summarize the incidence of OCD in HCWs. We searched the databases PubMed/MEDLINE (1980-present), EMBASE (1980-present) and Cochrane Library (1992-present) through May 2020 using the search term 'incidence of contact dermatitis in HCWs' according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Overall, 16 studies (six cohorts; 10 register-based) with follow-up periods between 1987 and 2013 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The incidence of OCD reported in studies using registers of occupational diseases ranged from 0.6 to 6.7 per 10 000 person-years. The cohort studies reported incidence from 15.9 to 780.0 per 10 000 person-years; the incidence was higher in studies which included apprentice nurses. A higher incidence was also observed amongst dental practitioners, particularly dental technicians and nurses, compared to other HCWs. Studies reporting incidence data are very scarce and results differed by study design, type of contact dermatitis and investigated HCWs. Our study highlighted the dearth of high-quality data on the incidence of OCD and the possible underestimation of disease burden. Prospective cohort studies with harmonized designs, especially exposure assessment and outcome ascertainment, are required to provide more accurate, valid and recent estimates of the incidence of OCD. A high incidence amongst specific occupational groups suggests the need to undertake intervention studies with a focus on prevention, particularly during pandemics such as COVID-19.","Larese Filon, F; Pesce, M; Paulo, M S; Loney, T; Modenese, A; John, S M; Kezic, S; Macan, J",J.

RESULTS: Chemosensitive disorders self-reported by 256 patients (74.2%) but the 30.1% of the 89 patients who did not report dysfunctions proved objectively hyposmic. Twenty-five percentage of patients were seen serious long-lasting complaints. All asymptomatic patients had a slight lowering of the olfactory threshold. No significant correlations were found between the presence and severity of chemosensitive disorders and the severity of the clinical course. On the contrary, there is a significant correlation between the duration of the olfactory and gustatory symptoms and the development of severe COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Patients under-report the frequency of chemosensitive disorders. Contrary to recent reports, such objective testing refutes the proposal that the presence of olfactory and gustatory dysfunction may predict a milder course, but instead suggests that those with more severe disease neglect such symptoms in the setting of severe respiratory disease.","Vaira, Luigi Angelo; Hopkins, Claire; Salzano, Giovanni; Petrocelli, Marzia; Melis, Andrea; Cucurullo, Marco; Ferrari, Mario; Gagliardini, Laura; Pipolo, Carlotta; Deiana, Giovanna; Fiore, Vito; De Vito, Andrea; Turra, Nicola; Canu, Sara; Maglio, Angelantonio; Serra, Antonello; Bussu, Francesco; Madeddu, Giordano; Babudieri, Sergio; Giuseppe Fois, Alessandro; Pirina, Pietro; Salzano, Francesco A; De Riu, Pierluigi; Biglioli, Federico; De Riu, Giacomo",Head Neck,227,16

The global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has suddenly resurrected a new pillar in oncology care: teleoncology. With oncologists reaching out to patients through telemedicine, it is possible to evaluate and fulfill patients' needs; triage patients for elective procedures; screen them for influenza-like illness; provide them with guidance for hospital visits, if needed; and bridge oral medications and treatments when a hospital visit is not desirable because of any high risk-benefit ratio. Teleoncology can bring great reassurance to patients at times when reaching an oncology center is challenging, and more so in resource-constrained countries. Evidence-based treatment protocols, dispensable by teleoncology, already exist for many sites of cancer and they can provide a bridge to treatment when patients are unable to reach cancer centers for their standard treatment.

Therefore, measuring and analyzing online health communication and public sentiment is essential for establishing effective and efficient disease control policies, especially in the early stage of an outbreak. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the trends of online health communication, analyze the focus of people's anxiety in the early stages of COVID-19, and evaluate the appropriateness of online information. METHODS: We collected 13,148 questions and 29,040 answers related to COVID-19 from Naver, the most popular Korean web portal (January 20, 2020, to March 2, 2020). Three main methods were used in this study: (1) the structural topic model was used to examine the topics in the online questions; (2) word network analysis was conducted to analyze the focus of people's anxiety and worry in the questions; and (3) two medical doctors assessed the appropriateness of the answers to the questions, which were primarily related to people's anxiety. RESULTS: A total of 50 topics and 6 cohesive topic communities were identified from the questions. Among them, topic community 4 (suspecting COVID-19 infection after developing a particular symptom) accounted for the largest portion of the questions. As the number of confirmed patients increased, the proportion of topics belonging to topic community 4 also increased. Additionally, the prolonged situation led to a slight increase in the proportion of topics related to job issues. People's anxieties and worries were closely related with physical symptoms and self-protection methods. Although relatively appropriate to suspect physical symptoms, a high proportion of answers related to self-protection methods were assessed as misinformation or advertisements. CONCLUSIONS: Search activity for online information regarding the COVID-19 outbreak has been active. Many of the online questions were related to people's anxieties and worries. A considerable portion of corresponding answers had false information or were advertisements. The study results could contribute reference information to various countries that need to monitor public anxiety and provide appropriate information in the early stage of an infectious disease outbreak, including COVID-19. Our research also contributes to developing methods for measuring public opinion and sentiment in an epidemic situation based on natural language data on the internet.","Jo, Wonkwang; Lee, Jaeho; Park, Junli; Kim, Yeol",J Med Internet Res,227,11

The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency of olfactory loss in an outpatient population who presented to a coronavirus testing center during a 2-week period and to evaluate the diagnostic value of the symptom ""sudden smell loss"" for screening procedures. METHODS: In this cross-sectional controlled cohort study, 500 patients who presented with symptoms of a common cold to a corona testing center and fulfilled corona testing criteria completed a standardized diagnostic questionnaire which included the patients' main symptoms, time course, and an additional self-assessment of the patients' current smell, taste function, and nasal breathing compared to the level before the onset of symptoms. RESULTS: Out of the 500 patients, 69 presented with olfactory loss. Twenty-two of them subsequently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Only 12 out of the patients without olfactory loss tested positive, resulting in a frequency of 64.7% for the symptom ""sudden smell loss"" in COVID-19 patients. Compared to COVID-19 patients without smell loss, they were significantly younger and less severely affected. Changes in nasal airflow were significantly more pronounced in SARS-CoV-2 negative patients with olfactory complaints compared to the patients with smell loss who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. By excluding patients with a blocked nose, the symptom ""sudden smell loss"" can be attested a high specificity (97%) and a sensitivity of 65% with a positive predictive value of 63% and negative predictive value of 97% for COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Considering the high frequency of smell loss in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, acute olfactory impairment should be recognized as an early symptom of the disease and should be tested for on a regular basis. In contrast to other acute viral smell impairment, COVID-19-associated smell loss seems to be only rarely accompanied by a severely blocked nose.","Haehner, Antje; Draf, Julia; Dräger, Sarah; de With, Katja; Hummel, Thomas",ORL J Otorhinolaryngol Relat Spec,227,22

Diabetes has rapidly emerged as a major comorbidity for COVID-19 severity. However, the phenotypic characteristics of diabetes in COVID-19 patients are unknown. METHODS: We conducted a nationwide multicentre observational study in people with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19 in 53 French centres in the period 10-31 March 2020. The primary outcome combined tracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation and/or death within 7 days of admission. Age- and sex-adjusted multivariable logistic regressions were performed to assess the prognostic value of clinical and biological features with the endpoint. ORs are reported for a 1 SD increase after standardisation. RESULTS: The current analysis focused on 1317 participants: 64.9% men, mean age 69.8 ± 13.0 years, median BMI 28.4 (25th-75th percentile: 25.0-32.7) kg/m2; with a predominance of type 2 diabetes (88.5%). Microvascular and macrovascular diabetic complications were found in 46.8% and 40.8% of cases, respectively. The primary outcome was encountered in 29.0% (95% CI 26.6, 31.5) of participants, while 10.6% (9.0, 12.4) died and 18.0% (16.0, 20.2) were discharged on day 7. In univariate analysis, characteristics prior to admission significantly associated with the primary outcome were sex, BMI and previous treatment with renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) blockers, but not age, type of diabetes, HbA1c, diabetic complications or glucose-lowering therapies. In multivariable analyses with covariates prior to admission, only BMI remained positively associated with the primary outcome (OR 1.28 [1.10, 1.47]). On admission, dyspnoea (OR 2.10 [1.31, 3.35]), as well as lymphocyte count (OR 0.67 [0.50, 0.88]), C-reactive protein (OR 1.93 [1.43, 2.59]) and AST (OR 2.23 [1.70, 2.93]) levels were independent predictors of the primary outcome. Finally, age (OR 2.48 [1.74, 3.53]), treated obstructive sleep apnoea (OR 2.80 [1.46, 5.38]), and microvascular (OR 2.14 [1.16, 3.94]) and macrovascular complications (OR 2.54 [1.44, 4.50]) were independently associated with the risk of death on day 7. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATIONS: In people with diabetes hospitalised for COVID-19, BMI, but not long-term glucose control, was positively and independently associated with tracheal intubation and/or death within 7 days.

Drawing on the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM), our survey analysis (n= 1,106) revealed that those obtaining COVID-19 information from conservative media and Trump briefings were less likely to believe that COVID-19 is a serious threat (perceived threat) and that recommended preventive behaviors are effective and feasible (perceived efficacy). These beliefs, in turn, resulted in their decreased intentions to adopt risk preventative behaviors. In contrast, those who got COVID-19 information from liberal media, health organizations' briefings, and traditional media reported heightened threat and efficacy perception, which, in turn, led to their willingness to take risk preventive actions.","Chung, Myojung; Jones-Jang, S Mo",Health Commun,227,4

This study demonstrates application of phytase and fermentation to a pea-oat protein blend with a good essential amino acid profile and subsequent texturization using extrusion cooking. Enzymatic treatment reduced the content of antinutrient phytic acid by 32%. Extrusion also degraded phytic acid by up to 18%, but the effect depended on the material. Differences in physicochemical, sensorial, and textural properties between untreated and phytase-treated extruded meat analogs were small. In contrast, fermented material was more difficult to texturize due to degradation of macromolecules; physicochemical and textural properties of extrudates were markedly different; sensory analysis showed enhancement of flavor, but also detected an increase in some unwanted taste attributes (bitterness, cereal and off-taste). Phytic acid was not degraded by fermentation. Analysis of volatile compounds showed extrusion eliminated volatiles from the raw material but introduced Maillard reaction products. Overall, phytase treatment and fermentation demonstrated the potential for application in extruded meat analogs but also highlighted the necessity of optimization of process conditions.","Kaleda, Aleksei; Talvistu, Karel; Tamm, Martti; Viirma, Maret; Rosend, Julia; Tanilas, Kristel; Kriisa, Marie; Part, Natalja; Tammik, Mari-Liis",,227,13

Data concerning haemostatic complications in children hospitalised for COVID-19/MIS-C are scant. OBJECTIVES: To share our experience in managing SARS-CoV-2 associated pro-coagulant state in hospitalised children. METHODS: D-dimer values were recorded at diagnosis in children hospitalised for SARS-CoV-2 related manifestations. In moderately to critically ill patients and MIS-C cases, coagulation and inflammatory markers were checked at multiple time-points and median results were compared. Pro-thrombotic risk factors were appraised for each child and thromboprophylaxis was started in selected cases. RESULTS: 35 patients were prospectively enrolled. D-dimer values did not discriminate COVID-19 of differing severity, whereas were markedly different between the COVID-19 and the MIS-C cohorts. In both cohorts, D-dimer and C Reactive Protein levels increased upon clinical worsening but were not accompanied by decreased fibrinogen or platelet values, with all parameters returning to normal upon disease resolution. 6 patients had multiple thrombotic risk factors and were started on pharmacological thromboprophylaxis. No deaths, thrombotic or bleeding complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pediatric patients show mildly altered coagulation and inflammatory parameters; on the other hand, MIS-C cases show laboratory signs of an inflammatory driven pro-coagulant status. Universal anticoagulant prophylaxis in hospitalised children with SARS-CoV-2 related manifestations is not warranted, but may be offered to patients with other pro-thrombotic risk factors in the context of a multi-modal therapeutic approach.","Del Borrello, Giovanni; Giraudo, Isaac; Bondone, Claudia; Denina, Marco; Garazzino, Silvia; Linari, Claudia; Mignone, Federica; Pruccoli, Giulia; Scolfaro, Carlo; Spadea, Manuela; Pollio, Berardino; Saracco, Paola",J. thromb. haemost,227,16

Despite the long and relatively stable historical lineage of product safety regulations, new technologies, changes in the world economy, and other major transformations have in recent years brought product safety again to the forefront of policy debates. As reforms are also underway, there is a motivation to review the complex safety policy framework in the European Union (EU). Thus, building on deliberative policy analysis and interpretative literature review, this paper reviews the safety policy for non-food consumer products in the EU. The review covers the historical background and the main laws, administration and enforcement, standardization and harmonization, laws enacted for specific products, notifications delivered by national safety authorities, recalls of dangerous products, and the liability of these. Based on the review and analysis of these themes and the associated literature, some current policy challenges are further discussed.","Ruohonen, Jukka",,227,29

This study assessed the seroprevalence among first responders in northeastern Ohio during May-September 2020. MethodsA survey and IgG antibody test against SARS-CoV-2 were offered to University Hospitals Health System affiliated first responder departments. ResultsA total of 3080 first responders with diverse job assignments from more than 400 fire and police departments participated in the study. Among them, 73 (2.4%) were seropositive while only 0.8% had previously positive RT-PCR results. Asymptomatic infection accounts for 46.6% of seropositivity. By occupation, seropositive rates were highest among administration/support staff (3.8%), followed by paramedics (3.0%), EMTs (2.6%), firefighters (2.2%), and police officers (0.8%). Seroprevalence was not associated with self-reported exposure as work exposure rates were: paramedics 48.2%, firefighters 37.1%, EMTs 32.3%, police officers 7.7%, and administration/support staff 4.4%. Self-reported community exposure was strongly correlated with self-reported work exposure rate rather than seroprevalence suggesting a potential impact of risk awareness. Additionally, no significant difference was found among gender or age groups; however, black Americans have a higher positivity rate than other races although they reported lower exposure. ConclusionsDespite the high work-associated exposure rate to SARS-CoV-2 infection, first responders with different roles demonstrated seroprevalence no higher than their administrative/supportive colleagues, which suggests infection control measures are effective in preventing work-related infection.","zhang, xiaochun; Saade, Elie; Noguez, Jaime H; Schmotzer, Christine",,227,26

Serological tests can be an important complementary approach. We aimed to assess the practical performance of RT-PCR-based surveillance protocols and determine the extent of undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection in Shenzhen, China. Methods: We did a cohort study in Shenzhen, China and attempted to recruit by telephone all RT-PCR-negative close contacts (defined as those who lived in the same residence as, or shared a meal, travelled, or socially interacted with, an index case within 2 days before symptom onset) of all RT-PCR-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 detected since January, 2020, via contact tracing. We measured anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in serum samples from RT-PCR-negative close contacts 2-15 weeks after initial virological testing by RT-PCR, using total antibody, IgG, and IgM ELISAs. In addition, we did a serosurvey of volunteers from neighbourhoods with no reported cases, and from neighbourhoods with reported cases. We assessed rates of infection undetected by RT-PCR, performance of RT-PCR over the course of infection, and characteristics of individuals who were seropositive on total antibody ELISA but RT-PCR negative. Findings: Between April 12 and May 4, 2020, we enrolled and collected serological samples from 2345 (53·0%) of 4422 RT-PCR-negative close contacts of cases of RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2. 1175 (50·1%) of 2345 were close contacts of cases diagnosed in Shenzhen with contact tracing details, and of these, 880 (74·9%) had serum samples collected more than 2 weeks after exposure to an index case and were included in our analysis. 40 (4·5%) of 880 RT-PCR-negative close contacts were positive on total antibody ELISA. The seropositivity rate with total antibody ELISA among RT-PCR-negative close contacts, adjusted for assay performance, was 4·1% (95% CI 2·9-5·7), which was significantly higher than among individuals residing in neighbourhoods with no reported cases (0·0% [95% CI 0·0-1·1]). RT-PCR-positive individuals were 8·0 times (95% CI 5·3-12·7) more likely to report symptoms than those who were RT-PCR-negative but seropositive, but both groups had a similar distribution of sex, age, contact frequency, and mode of contact. RT-PCR did not detect 48 (36% [95% CI 28-44]) of 134 infected close contacts, and false-negative rates appeared to be associated with stage of infection. Interpretation: Even rigorous RT-PCR testing protocols might miss a substantial proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections, perhaps in part due to difficulties in determining the timing of testing in asymptomatic individuals for optimal sensitivity. RT-PCR-based surveillance and control protocols that include rapid contact tracing, universal RT-PCR testing, and mandatory 2-week quarantine were, nevertheless, able to contain community spread in Shenzhen, China.

RECENT FINDINGS: Identifying predictors of adverse outcomes following orthopedic surgery is vital in the decision-making process for surgeons and patients. Recently, automated risk calculators have been developed to quantify patient-specific preoperative risk associated with certain orthopedic procedures. Automated risk calculators may provide the orthopedic surgeon with a valuable tool for clinical decision-making, informed consent, and the shared decision-making process with the patient. Understanding how an automated risk calculator was developed is arguably as important as the performance of the calculator. Additionally, conveying and interpreting the results of these risk calculators with the patient and its influence on surgical decision-making are paramount. The most abundant research on automated risk calculators has been conducted in the spine, total hip and knee arthroplasty, and trauma literature. Currently, many risk calculators show promise, but much research is still needed to improve them. We recommend they be used only as adjuncts to clinical decision-making. Understanding how a calculator was developed, and accurate communication of results to the patient, is paramount.","Merrill, Robert K; Ibrahim, John M; Machi, Anthony S; Raphael, James S",,227,16

AIM: To assess the effect of the pandemic on antibiotic prescribing, accounting for changes in consultations for respiratory and urinary tract infections (RTIs/UTIs). DESIGN AND SETTING: Population-based cohort study using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) GOLD database from January 2017 to September 2020. METHOD: Interrupted time-series analysis evaluated changes in antibiotic prescribing and RTI/UTI consultations adjusting for age, sex, season, and secular trends. The authors assessed the proportion of COVID-19 episodes associated with antibiotic prescribing. RESULTS: There were 253 655 registered patients in 2017 and 232 218 in 2020, with 559 461 antibiotic prescriptions, 216 110 RTI consultations, and 36 402 UTI consultations. Compared with prepandemic months, March 2020 was associated with higher antibiotic prescribing (adjusted rate ratio [ARR] 1.13; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11 to 1.16). Antibiotic prescribing fell below predicted rates between April and August 2020, reaching a minimum in May (ARR 0.73; 95% CI = 0.71 to 0.75). Pandemic months were associated with lower rates of RTI/UTI consultations, particularly in April for RTIs (ARR 0.23; 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.25). There were small reductions in the proportion of RTI consultations with antibiotic prescribed and no reduction for UTIs.

Cancer patients seem to be more susceptible to infection and disease deterioration, but the factors affecting the deterioration remain unclear. We aimed to develop an individualized model for prediction of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) deterioration in cancer patients. The clinical data of 276 cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in 33 designated hospitals of Hubei, China from December 21, 2019 to March 18, 2020, were collected and randomly divided into a training and a validation cohort by a ratio of 2:1. Cox stepwise regression analysis was carried out to select prognostic factors. The prediction model was developed in the training cohort. The predictive accuracy of the model was quantified by C-index and time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (t-AUC). Internal validation was assessed by the validation cohort. Risk stratification based on the model was carried out. Decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the clinical usefulness of the model. We found age, cancer type, computed tomography baseline image features (ground glass opacity and consolidation), laboratory findings (lymphocyte count, serum levels of C-reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase, direct bilirubin, urea, and d-dimer) were significantly associated with symptomatic deterioration. The C-index of the model was 0.755 in the training cohort and 0.779 in the validation cohort. The t-AUC values were above 0.7 within 8 weeks both in the training and validation cohorts. Patients were divided into two risk groups based on the nomogram: low-risk (total points &#8804; 9.98) and high-risk (total points > 9.98) group. The Kaplan-Meier deterioration-free survival of COVID-19 curves presented significant discrimination between the two risk groups in both training and validation cohorts. The model indicated good clinical applicability by DCA curves. This study presents an individualized nomogram model to individually predict the possibility of symptomatic deterioration of COVID-19 in patients with cancer.","Xu, Bin; Song, Ke-Han; Yao, Yi; Dong, Xiao-Rong; Li, Lin-Jun; Wang, Qun; Yang, Ji-Yuan; Hu, Wei-Dong; Xie, Zhi-Bin; Luo, Zhi-Guo; Luo, Xiu-Li; Liu, Jing; Rao, Zhi-Guo; Zhang, Hui-Bo; Wu, Jie; Li, Lan; Gong, Hong-Yun; Chu, Qian; Song, Qi-Bin; Wang, Jie",Cancer Sci,227,16

Still, only 2% of referred patients to the OPO in April 2020 were on ventilators and considered possible organ donors, versus a baseline of 11% in 2019. Few of these deaths were unrelated to COVID-19. Accordingly, organ donors declined to 10 in April (from 26 in March). Despite the exclusion of marginal donors and organs, the implementation of COVID-19 donor testing, and the availability of local procurement surgeons, only 1 organ (a liver) was accepted by a transplant center outside of New York State and 8 organs (5 livers, 4 kidneys) were transplanted in state; 11 organs (1 liver, 10 kidneys) were discarded.

We hypothesised that lockdown restrictions were associated with reductions in severe asthma exacerbations requiring emergency asthma admissions and/or leading to death. METHODS: Using data from Public Health Scotland and the Secure Anonymised Information Linkage Databank in Wales, we compared weekly counts of emergency admissions and deaths due to asthma over the first 18 weeks in 2020 with the national averages over 2015-2019. We modelled the impact of instigating lockdown on these outcomes using interrupted time-series analysis. Using fixed-effect meta-analysis, we derived pooled estimates of the overall changes in trends across the two nations. We also investigated trends in asthma-related primary care prescribing and emergency department (ED) attendances in Wales. RESULTS: Lockdown was associated with a 36% pooled reduction in emergency admissions for asthma (incidence rate ratio, IRR: 0.64, 95% CI: 0.49 to 0.83, p value 0.001) across both countries. There was no significant change in asthma deaths (pooled IRR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.17 to 1.94, p value 0.37). ED asthma attendances in Wales declined during lockdown (IRR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.73 to 0.99, p value 0.03). A large spike of 121% more inhaled corticosteroids and 133% more oral corticosteroid prescriptions was seen in Wales in the week before lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: National lockdowns were associated with substantial reductions in severe asthma exacerbations leading to hospital admission across both Scotland and Wales, with no corresponding increase in asthma deaths.","Davies, Gwyneth A; Alsallakh, Mohammad A; Sivakumaran, Shanya; Vasileiou, Eleftheria; Lyons, Ronan A; Robertson, Chris; Sheikh, Aziz",Thorax,227,20

This study consisted of 131 portable CXR from 84 COVID-19 patients (51M 55.1±14.9yo; 29F 60.1±14.3yo; 4 missing information). Three expert chest radiologists scored the left and right lung separately based on the degree of opacity (0-3) and geographic extent (0-4). Deep-learning convolutional neural network (CNN) was used to predict lung disease severity scores. Data were split into 80% training and 20% testing datasets. Correlation analysis between AI-predicted versus radiologist scores were analyzed. Comparison was made with traditional and transfer learning. The average opacity score was 2.52 (range: 0-6) with a standard deviation of 0.25 (9.9%) across three readers. The average geographic extent score was 3.42 (range: 0-8) with a standard deviation of 0.57 (16.7%) across three readers. The inter-rater agreement yielded a Fleiss' Kappa of 0.45 for opacity score and 0.71 for extent score. AI-predicted scores strongly correlated with radiologist scores, with the top model yielding a correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.90 (range: 0.73-0.90 for traditional learning and 0.83-0.90 for transfer learning) and a mean absolute error of 8.5% (ranges: 17.2-21.0% and 8.5%-15.5, respectively). Transfer learning generally performed better. In conclusion, deep-learning CNN accurately stages disease severity on portable chest x-ray of COVID-19 lung infection. This approach may prove useful to stage lung disease severity, prognosticate, and predict treatment response and survival, thereby informing risk management and resource allocation.","Zhu, Jocelyn; Shen, Beiyi; Abbasi, Almas; Hoshmand-Kochi, Mahsa; Li, Haifang; Duong, Tim Q",PLoS One,227,1

This is presenting considerable challenges in the effort to contain and control the pandemic. We believe that the current health communication approach implemented by the health authorities and media outlets need to be redesigned to bring a sustainable COVID-19 preventive behavior. The purpose of this perspective paper, therefore, is to stimulate discussions on effective health communication strategy to help the public persistently practice COVID-19 preventive measures over the long term. We undertook a series of discussions amongst the authors in order to synthesize individual viewpoints into 'experts' perspective' driven by our daily observations and our expertise in the health service research. In light of this, we suggested that an effective health communication strategy need to address context specific situations to avoid temptation to ignore the ramifications of this very serious pandemic. This strategy includes trying to make sense of daily reported COVID-19 cases, being highly selective regarding sources of information, and being sensitive and responsive to religious and cultural factors. The media, health professionals, and leaders need to teach us how to live with the pandemic informed by robust scientific sources.","Shewamene, Zewdneh; Shiferie, Fisseha; Girma, Engida; Wubishet, Befikadu L; Kiros, Mizan; Abraha, Atakelti; Reshad, Abduljelil; Tiruneh, Getachew; Worku, Benyam; Lemlemu, Eskedar; Balkew, Rahel Belete",Ethiop J Health Sci,227,17

This study examines the risks that the COVID-19 pandemic poses to equitable access to essential medicines and vaccines (EMV) for universal health coverage in Africa. METHODS: We searched medical databases and grey literature up to 2 October 2020 for studies reporting data on prospective pathways and innovative strategies relevant for the assessment and management of the emerging risks in accessibility, safety, quality, and affordability of EMV in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used the resulting pool of evidence to support our analysis and to draw policy recommendations to mitigate the emerging risks and improve preparedness for future crises. RESULTS: Of the 310 records screened, 134 were included in the analysis. We found that the disruption of the international system affects more immediately the capability of low- and middle-income countries to acquire the basket of EMV. The COVID-19 pandemic may facilitate dishonesty and fraud, increasing the propensity of patients to take substandard and falsified drugs. Strategic regional cooperation in the form of joint tenders and contract awarding, joint price negotiation and supplier selection, as well as joint market research, monitoring, and evaluation could improve the supply, affordability, quality, and safety of EMV. Sustainable health financing along with international technology transfer and substantial investment in research and development are needed to minimize the vulnerability of African countries arising from their dependence on imported EMV. To ensure equitable access, community-based strategies such as mobile clinics as well as fees exemptions for vulnerable and under-served segments of society might need to be considered. Strategies such as task delegation and telephone triage could help reduce physician workload. This coupled with payments of risk allowance to frontline healthcare workers and health-literate healthcare organization might improve the appropriate use of EMV. CONCLUSIONS: Innovative and sustainable strategies informed by comparative risk assessment are increasingly needed to ensure that local economic, social, demographic, and epidemiological risks and potentials are accounted for in the national COVID-19 responses.","Amimo, Floriano; Lambert, Ben; Magit, Anthony; Hashizume, Masahiro",Global Health,227,1

The objectives of this research were to detect and describe the changes in work environment of community pharmacists in Vojvodina during the state of emergency due to COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic effects on job related stress were assessed. METHODS: Community pharmacists from Vojvodina completed an online questionnaire on work environment changes related to COVID-19 (cross-sectional study). RESULTS: Out of the 1574 licenced pharmacists in Vojvodina, 392 completed the survey. Workload increase, reported by 90.8% of pharmacists, was caused mostly by higher demand for safety equipment, antiseptics and disinfectants, dietary products and medicines. Most pharmacists (93.1%) considered pharmacy workflow to be more complex than before the pandemic. Clients' behavior was described as less pleasant since the start of the pandemic by 67.6% of the community pharmacists. Many were concerned for their health and the health of their families (68.9%). Community pharmacists rated their stress levels higher if they i) were working in larger chains, ii) experienced clients' behavior as less pleasant or/and iii) were concerned for their/their family health. CONCLUSIONS: Current research pointed out the need for a more robust healthcare system which would allow rapid introduction of new activities and roles for community pharmacists that could possibly decrease job-related stress. Legal steps to improve the work environment in community pharmacies are necessary and urgent in order to fully utilize their skills and knowledge.","Jovicic-Bata, Jelena; Pavlovic, Nebojsa; Milosevic, Natasa; Gavaric, Neda; Golocorbin-Kon, Svetlana; Todorovic, Nemanja; Lalic-Popovic, Mladena",BMC Health Serv Res,227,1

So far, autonomic dysfunction (AD) has not been reported in patients with COVID-19 infection. Aim: Assessment of AD in the early phase of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2 virus). Patients and methods: We analyzed 116 PCR positive COVID-19 patients. After the exclusion of 41 patients with associate diseases (CADG), partitioned to patients with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and syncope, the remaining patients were included into a severe group, (45 patients with confirmed interstitial pneumonia) and mild group (30 patients). Basic cardiovascular autonomic reflex tests (CART) were performed, followed by beat-to-beat heart rate variability (HRV) and systolic and diastolic blood pressure variability (BPV) analysis, along with baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS). Non-linear analysis of HRV was provided by Poincare Plot. Results were compared to 77 sex and age-matched controls. Results: AD (sympathetic, parasympathetic, or both) in our study has been revealed in 51.5% of severe, 78.0% of mild COVID-19 patients, and the difference compared to healthy controls was significant (p=0.018). Orthostatic hypotension has been established in 33.0% COVID-19 patients compared to 2.6% controls (p=0.001). Most of the spectral parameters of HRV and BPV confirmed AD, most prominent in the severe COVID-19 group. BRS was significantly lower in all patients (severe, mild, CADG), indicating significant sudden cardiac death risk. Conclusion: Cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy should be taken into account in COVID-19 patients’ assessment. It can be an explanation for a variety of registered manifestations, enabling a comprehensive diagnostic approach and further treatment.","Milovanovic, Branislav Djajic Vlado Bajic Dragana Djokovic Aleksandra Krajnovic Tatjana Jovanovic Sladjana Verhaz Antonija Kovacevic Pedja Ostojic Miodrag",Frontiers in Neuroscience,227,24

This study aims to develop a new method for the safe and high-added value reuse of materials for polypropylene face masks based on carbonization of porous polymer. The waste masks were first sulfonated in an autoclave, then used as carbon source and turned into a dense hollow fiber porous structure after a one-step heat treatment. This porous structure has a high specific capacitance, namely 328.9 F g-1 at a current density of 1 A g-1. Besides, the assembled solid-state capacitor possesses a good energy density of 10.4 W h kg-1 at a power density of 600 W kg-1, and excellent cycling stability with a capacitance retention rate of 81.1% after 3000 cycles.

We evaluated the performance of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) imaging in the diagnosis of suspected COVID-19 infection compared to RT-PCR nasopharyngeal swab alone in patients hospitalized for suspected COVID-19 infection. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of 324 consecutive patients admitted to Temple University Hospital. All hospitalized patients who had RT-PCR testing and HRCT were included in the study. HRCTs were classified as Category 1, 2 or 3. Category 1 scans were high probability scans (i.e: ground glass opacities (GGOs), crazy-paving, reverse halo/peri lobular pattern irrespective of location and laterality). Category 3 were low probability scans consistent with an alternate diagnosis. Category 2 scans were indeterminate. Patients were then divided into four groups based on HRCT category and RT-PCR swab results for analysis (Group 1: COVID (+) PCR and Category 1 CT scan, Group 2: COVID (+) PCR and Category 2 and 3 CT scan, Group 3: COVID (-) PCR and Category 1 CT scan, Group 4: COVID (-) PCR and Category 2 and 3 CT scan). Inflammatory markers and treatments were compared across these groups. Results: The average age of patients was 59.4(+15.2) years and 123(38.9%) were female. Predominant ethnicity was African American 148 (46.11%). 161 patients tested positive by RT-PCR, while 41 tested positives by HRCT. 167 (52.02%) had category 1 scan, 63 (19.63%) had category 2 scan and 91 (28.35%) had category 3 HRCT scans. There was substantial agreement between our radiologists for HRCT classification (κ = 0.64). Sensitivity and specificity of HRCT classification system was 77.6 and 73.7 respectively. 38.9 % (n=125) patients were classified as Group 1);11.2% (n=36) as Group 2, 12.8% (n=41) as Group 3 and 34.8 % (n=115) as Group 4. In group 3, 38 (92.7 %) patients received respiratory viral panels (RVP) which were all negative;21(51.2%) had sputum cultures, only 1 was positive for staph aureus. When comparing Group 1 to Group 3, there were no statistically significant differences in inflammatory markers. There were no statistically significant differences amongst Groups 1 and 3 with respect to treatments Conclusion: Due to its high infectivity and asymptomatic transmission, until a highly sensitive and specific COVID-19 test is developed, HRCT is a valuable assessment tool for patients who are hospitalized with suspected COVID-19.","Patel, M.; Chowdhury, J.

Case presentation: The first patient is 45 years-old who has been exposed to SARS CoV-2. Upon admission due to acute abdomen evidence surgery is performed in which an intestinal resection with an adequate post-surgical evolution takes place so the patient is discharged after 4 days with a prescription for oral anticoagulants. The second one is 42 years-old and has comorbidities. The patient is admitted upon evidence of COVID-19, after showing signs of vein mesenteric ischemia in a CT scan surgery is performed, however the patient dies 24 h after the intervention. Discussion: Within severe cases of patients with COVID-19 the incidence of a symptomatology or gastrointestinal complications is high (39-73.8%). Thromboprophylaxis is recommended to all patients admitted for COVID-19, starting with heparin of low molecular weight as prophylaxis, as well as continuing with oral anticoagulants after being discharged. Conclusion: Despite the fact that knowledge of the disease is rapidly advancing, all available treatments are still nonspecific to SARS-CoV-2 and the optimal management of COVID-19 remains unclear. An unexplained clinical picture should raise the suspicion for rare conditions such as mesenteric thrombosis. Adequate prophylactic measures should be implemented both during hospitalization and after discharge.","Rodriguez-Nakamura, Reiko M; Gonzalez-Calatayud, Mariel; Martinez Martinez, Antonio Ramiro",Int J Surg Case Rep,227,1

However, symptoms such of SARS-CoV-2 did not decrease in these active and high-risk subpopulations. Among the more inactive and low-risk subpopulations, such as elderly persons, no discernible impacts are observed in both the utilization of restaurants and bars and the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2.

Although these four patients had symptoms that included a fever, malaise, runny nose, and cough, one patient had no symptoms on admission. Two of the four patients needed mechanical ventilation due to respiratory deterioration. One of the patients who required mechanical ventilation was transferred to a higher-level medical institution. Except for that patient, the other three patients were able to return home under their own power. Every patient took lopinavir/ritonavir, which was considered the most effective treatment at the time. We used it after receiving approval from the ethics committee in our hospital. In this case report, we emphasize that some patients need to be carefully monitored, even if their respiratory condition is stable at the initial presentation, as their respiratory status may deteriorate rapidly within a few days after oxygen administration begins.","Sano, Masahiro; Nishioka, Haruka; Yamazaki, Jun; Miyamoto, Ippei; Adachi, Takuya",Intern Med,227,25

We prepared a guiding protocol for treating early to moderate COVID-19 patients with plasma transfusion from convalescent COVID-19 patients. This protocol was deduced based on previously published reports and studies that evaluated and tested convalescent plasma as a prospective therapy for COVID-19 patients. The protocol covers instructions on patient and donor selection criteria, plasma harvesting, plasma product specifications, dosage and precautions for convalescent plasma collection and transfusion process.

The most common reason is that the students misinterpreted the question. Word problems sometimes mention a vocabulary that is somewhat difficult to define by the students. Besides, word problems, especially algebra word problems, are not easy to be visualised because the comparative vocabularies used are confusing for some students. As a result, they end up with incorrect conclusions instead. As such, this study aims to create augmented reality-based student’s worksheets to assist the students to visualise algebra word problems using animations. This is a design and development study, which consists five stages. The first stage is investigating students’ needs (amid covid-19 pandemic in particular). After that, the augmented reality-based student’s worksheets are designed by considering the investigating result. Next, the worksheets are constructed before being tested and evaluated. Based on the evaluation, the worksheets are revised then finally it is ready to be implemented. The recent progress of the research is that the augmented reality-based student’s worksheets has been revised and ready to be implemented. The worksheets allow students to study from home by scanning codes using their devices (android smartphones are advised) then video animations will appear and explain the algebra word problems they are working on.","Salim, S.

Here, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning(RL) framework for autonomous guidewire navigation in a robot-assisted coronary intervention. Using Rainbow, a segment-wise learning approach is applied to determine how best to accelerate training using human demonstrations with deep Q-learning from demonstrations (DQfD), transfer learning, and weight initialization. `State' for RL is customized as a focus window near the guidewire tip, and subgoals are placed to mitigate a sparse reward problem. The RL agent improves performance, eventually enabling the guidewire to reach all valid targets in `stable' phase. Our framework opens anew direction in the automation of robot-assisted intervention, providing guidance on RL in physical spaces involving mechanical fatigue.","Kweon, Jihoon; Kim, Kyunghwan; Lee, Chaehyuk; Kwon, Hwi; Park, Jinwoo; Song, Kyoseok; Kim, Young In; Park, Jeeone; Back, Inwook; Roh, Jae-Hyung; Moon, Youngjin; Choi, Jaesoon; Kim, Young-Hak",,227,24

We evaluate whether these imaging characteristics were associated with angiographic outcomes of aspiration and stent retriever thrombectomy in COMPASS: a trial of aspiration thrombectomy versus stent retriever thrombectomy as first-line approach for large vessel occlusion. METHODS: Clot density and perviousness were measured by two independent operators who were blind to all the final angiographic and clinical outcomes. The association of clot density and perviousness with the Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (TICI) scale after first pass was assessed using univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Among all patients enrolled in COMPASS, 165 were eligible for the post-hoc analysis (81 patients in the aspiration first and 84 in the stent retriever first groups). Overall mean perviousness of clot was significantly higher in patient with mTICI 2b-3 after first pass (28.6±22.9 vs 20.3±19.2, p=0.017). Mean perviousness among patients who achieved TICI 2c/3 versus TICI 2b versus TICI 0-2a in the aspiration first group varied significantly (32.6±26.1, 35.3±24.4, and 17.7±13.1, p=0.013). The association of perviousness with first pass success was not significant in the stent retriever group. Using multivariate analysis, high perviousness (defined as cut-off >27.6) was an independent predictor of TICI 2b-3 (OR 3.82, 95% CI 1.10 to 13.19; p=0.034).

A pilot study,19.091604,8.246158,2021,"BACKGROUND: Myeloperoxidase-specific ANCA (MPO-ANCA) are implicated in the pathogenesis of vasculitis and GN. Kinins play a major role during acute inflammation by regulating vasodilatation and vascular permeability and by modulating adhesion and migration of leukocytes. Kinin system activation occurs in patients with ANCA vasculitis. Previous studies in animal models of GN and sclerosing kidney diseases have demonstrated protective effects of bradykinin receptor 1 (B1R) blockade via interference with myeloid cell trafficking. METHODS: To investigate the role of B1R in a murine model of MPO-ANCA GN, we evaluated effects of B1R genetic ablation and pharmacologic blockade. We used bone marrow chimeric mice to determine the role of B1R in bone marrow-derived cells (leukocytes) versus nonbone marrow-derived cells. We elucidated mechanisms of B1R effects using in vitro assays for MPO-ANCA-induced neutrophil activation, endothelial adherence, endothelial transmigration, and neutrophil adhesion molecule surface display. RESULTS: B1R deficiency or blockade prevented or markedly reduced ANCA-induced glomerular crescents, necrosis, and leukocyte influx in mice. B1R was not required for in vitro MPO-ANCA-induced neutrophil activation. Leukocyte B1R deficiency, but not endothelial B1R deficiency, decreased glomerular neutrophil infiltration induced by MPO-ANCA in vivo. B1R enhanced ANCA-induced neutrophil endothelial adhesion and transmigration in vitro. ANCA-activated neutrophils exhibited changes in Mac-1 and LFA-1, important regulators of neutrophil endothelial adhesion and transmigration: ANCA-activated neutrophils increased surface expression of Mac-1 and increased shedding of LFA-1, whereas B1R blockade reduced these effects. CONCLUSIONS: The leukocyte B1R plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of MPO-ANCA-induced GN in a mouse model by modulating neutrophil-endothelial interaction. B1R blockade may have potential as a therapy for ANCA GN and vasculitis.","Hu, Peiqi; Su, Hua; Xiao, Hong; Gou, Shen-Ju; Herrera, Carolina A; Alba, Marco A; Kakoki, Masao; Falk, Ronald J; Jennette, J Charles",J Am Soc Nephrol,227,16

METHODS: Second-year (D2) and fourth-year (D4) dental students, postgraduate orthodontic students (OS), and periodontology students (PS) were presented with an anonymous survey of 10 cases, each with five choices of diagnosis and seven therapeutic approaches. The cases included a patient summary, photographs, radiographs, periodontal charting, and ranged from health to periodontitis. Consensus diagnosis, used as a gold standard, was established between two experienced periodontists. Diagnosis and treatment choices for each case were compared across educational groups using Fisher's exact test. The level of agreement among educational groups was assessed using a multirater kappa coefficient. RESULTS: The survey was completed in 2020 with a 72.4% overall response rate (57-D2, 45-D4, 17-OS, and 12-PS). The overall level of agreement on diagnosis was fair (&#954; = 0.24, p <.0001) with PS showing the most agreement (&#954; = 0.55, p <.0001). There were tendencies to prioritize stage over grade and extent in assigning diagnoses and to overdiagnose disease severity and underdiagnose localized periodontitis. Nonsurgical periodontal therapies had the highest overall agreement (&#954; = 0.63 for scaling/root planing and &#954; = 0.44 for maintenance, p <.0001). Response distribution per case and per level of education indicated that PS more consistently agreed with the gold standard than any other group. CONCLUSIONS: OS, D2, and D4 students demonstrated inferior agreement levels compared to PS, successfully recognized health from disease, suggested appropriate treatment plans, and tended to overdiagnose milder periodontal conditions.","Abou-Arraj, Ramzi V; Kaur, Maninder; Alkhoury, Shadi; Swain, Thomas A; Geurs, Nicolaas C; Souccar, Nada M",J. dent. educ,227,6

The subsequent line of therapy should be determined on the basis of previous treatments and approved drugs available, based on the results of randomized clinical trials. Unfortunately, no phase 3 trial has compared the safety and efficacy of drugs after immunotherapy; thus, drug choice is more empirical than evidence-based. As the tumor may still be anti-VEGFR drug-naïve, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for first line treatment (e.g., sunitinib or pazopanib) may be beneficial. Because this is a second-line treatment, patients could also receive axitinib, cabozantinib, or a combination of lenvatinib and everolimus. The treating physician should choose an appropriate treatment according to the patient's age, comorbidities, and tolerability of previous checkpoint inhibitors, among other considerations. Cases of patients with renal cell carcinoma refractory to checkpoint inhibitor treatment are growing, warranting a review of the activity and safety of target therapies after immunotherapy.","Perego, Gianluca; Barzaghi, Paolo; Vavassori, Ivano; Petrelli, Fausto",Med Oncol,227,28

In this study, we aim to evaluate how dermatologists in our country have viewed and experienced teledermatology during the pandemic through surveys. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was carried out by using an online survey for evaluating the teledermatology experiences of dermatologists in Turkey and how they have viewed teledermatology during the two-month pandemic period and the two-month pre-pandemic period. RESULTS: The number of patients evaluated with teledermatology methods were found to be significantly higher in the pandemic period when compared with the pre-pandemic period. The rates of using video calls with mobile phone and online video calls were found to be significantly higher in the pandemic period when compared with the pre-pandemic period. CONCLUSION: Our study results show that the teledermatology method had a higher rate of usage compared to before the pandemic.","Altunisik, Nihal; Turkmen, Dursun; Calikoglu, Emel; Sener, Serpil",J. cosmet. dermatol,227,24

This impairs the cough response, which can increase the risk of complications if infected with coronavirus disease 2019. This case describes a 32-yr-old man with an acute traumatic motor incomplete spinal cord injury, C4 American Spinal cord Injury Association Impairment Scale D D, in an inpatient rehabilitation facility who presented with only a fever. Initial infectious workup was negative, and he continued to have elevated temperatures with no other symptoms. He was then tested for coronavirus disease 2019 and found to be positive. This is the first documented case that identifies this potentially lethal disease in an acute motor incomplete spinal cord injury in an inpatient rehabilitation setting. We further discuss how physiatrists need to be aware of milder presentation of coronavirus disease 2019 in patients with spinal cord injuries. Inability to recognize this disease can lead to delayed diagnosis and asymptomatic spread in an inpatient rehabilitation setting.","Khaliq, Fareea; Ratnasingam, Denesh; Bush-Arnold, Michael",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,227,21

However, ionizing radiation during CT studies causes concern for patients who require dynamic observation, as well as for examination of children and young people. For this retrospective study, we included 15 suspected for COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized in April 2020, Russia. There were 4 adults with positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19. All patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations using MR-LUND PROTOCOL: Single-shot Fast Spin Echo (SSFSE), LAVA 3D and IDEAL 3D, Echo-planar imaging (EPI) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and Fast Spin Echo (FSE) T2 weighted imaging (T2WI). On T2WI changes were identified in 9 (60,0%) patients, on DWI - in 5 (33,3%) patients. In 5 (33,3%) patients lesions of the parenchyma were visualized on T2WI and DWI simultaneously. At the same time, 4 (26.7%) patients had changes in lung tissue only on T2WI. (P(McNemar) = 0,125; OR = 0,00 (95%); kappa = 0,500). In those patients who had CT scan, the changes were comparable to MRI. The results showed that in case of CT is not available, it is advisable to conduct a chest MRI for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. Considering that T2WI is a fluid-sensitive sequence, if imaging for the lung infiltration is required, we can recommend the abbreviated MRI protocol consisting of T2 and T1 WI. These data may be applicable for interpreting other studies, such as thoracic spine MRI, detecting signs of viral pneumonia of asymptomatic patients. MRI can detect features of viral pneumonia.","Vasilev, Yu A; Sergunova, K A; Bazhin, A V; Masri, A G; Vasileva, Yu N; Semenov, D S; Kudryavtsev, N D; Panina, O Yu; Khoruzhaya, A N; Zinchenko, V V; Akhmad, E S; Petraikin, A V; Vladzymyrskyy, A V; Midaev, A V; Morozov, S P",Magn Reson Imaging,227,13

In this paper, the behavior of an epidemic is simulated on different contact networks. Herein, it is assumed that the infection may be transmitted at each contact from an infected person to a susceptible individual with a given probability. The probability of transmitting the disease may change due to the individuals' social behavior or interventions prescribed by the authorities. We utilized simulation on the contact networks to demonstrate how seesaw scenarios of lockdown can curb infection and level the pandemic without maximum pressure on the poor societies. Soft scenarios consist of closing businesses 2, 3, and 4 days in between with four levels of lockdown respected by 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the population. The findings reveal that the outbreak can be flattened under softer alternatives instead of a doomsday scenario of complete lockdown. More specifically, it is turned out that proposed soft lockdown strategies can flatten up to 120% of the pandemic course. It is also revealed that transmission probability has a crucial role in the course of the infection, growth rate of the infection, and the number of infected individuals.","Afshar-Nadjafi, Behrouz Niaki Seyed Taghi Akhavan",Sustainable Cities and Society,227,1

However, little guidance is available to inform these activities, and many health departments rely on deterministic algorithms that may miss many true matches. In the context of public health action, these missed matches lead to missed opportunities to deliver interventions and may exacerbate existing health inequities. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to compare the performance of record linkage algorithms commonly used in public health practice. METHODS: We compared five deterministic (exact, Stenger, Ocampo 1, Ocampo 2, and Bosh) and two probabilistic record linkage algorithms (fastLink and beta record linkage [BRL]) using simulations and a real-world scenario. We simulated pairs of datasets with varying numbers of errors per record and the number of matching records between the two datasets (ie, overlap). We matched the datasets using each algorithm and calculated their recall (ie, sensitivity, the proportion of true matches identified by the algorithm) and precision (ie, positive predictive value, the proportion of matches identified by the algorithm that were true matches). We estimated the average computation time by performing a match with each algorithm 20 times while varying the size of the datasets being matched. In a real-world scenario, HIV and sexually transmitted disease surveillance data from King County, Washington, were matched to identify people living with HIV who had a syphilis diagnosis in 2017. We calculated the recall and precision of each algorithm compared with a composite standard based on the agreement in matching decisions across all the algorithms and manual review. RESULTS: In simulations, BRL and fastLink maintained a high recall at nearly all data quality levels, while being comparable with deterministic algorithms in terms of precision. Deterministic algorithms typically failed to identify matches in scenarios with low data quality. All the deterministic algorithms had a shorter average computation time than the probabilistic algorithms. BRL had the slowest overall computation time (14 min when both datasets contained 2000 records). In the real-world scenario, BRL had the lowest trade-off between recall (309/309, 100.0%) and precision (309/312, 99.0%).

To date, about 123,498 million cases have been reported worldwide and about 2.71 million deaths were reported. This newly discovered pandemic has majorly impacted many things such as tourism, the economy, and others. Because of this, low-income households (also known as B40) seem to be affected. Through a survey conducted online in the state of Pahang, Malaysia, this study aims to examine the level of depression, anxiety, and stress faced by B40 households. The study extracted data from 128 respondents (N=128) from B40 households around the state by using the DASS-21 online form. The result of the study showed that 31% respondents had moderate depression, 40% had severe depression, and 22% had extremely severe depression. Moreover, 15% respondents had moderate anxiety, 16% had severe anxiety, and 68% had extremely severe anxiety. The result also showed that 31% respondents had moderate stress, 36% had severe stress, and 18% had extremely severe stress. All scores were tabulated from the administration of the Depression, Stress, and Anxiety Scale (DASS-21) inventory. The result showed that the government sector and self-employed groups differed slightly at p<0.051. Regardless of the employment sector within B40 respondents, this study showed that they are prone to have mental health issues especially depression, anxiety, and stress.

However, little has been reported regarding the impact on blood utilization. We quantified the impact of COVID-19 on blood utilization and discards among facilities reporting to the National Healthcare Safety Network Hemovigilance Module. METHODS: Facilities continuously reporting data, during January 2016-June 2020, on transfused and discarded blood components, stratified by component type (red blood cells [RBC], platelets and plasma), were included. Interrupted time-series analysis with generalized estimating equations, adjusting for facility surgical volume and seasonality, was used to quantify changes in blood utilization and discards relative to a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services notification delaying non-essential medical procedures (March 2020). RESULTS: Seventy-two facilities included in the analyses, on average, transfused 44,548 and discarded 2202 blood components monthly. Following the March 2020 notification and after multivariable adjustment, RBC and platelet utilization declined, -14.8% (p < 0.001) and - 16.6% (p = 0.017) respectively. Discards increased for RBCs (49.0%, p = 0.013) and platelets (60.4%, p = 0.002). No statistically significant change in plasma was found. Following these abrupt changes, blood utilization and discards rebounded towards baseline with RBC use increasing by 5.7% (p < 0.001), and platelet and RBC discards decreasing -16.4% (<0.001) and - 12.7 (p = 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSION: Following notification delaying elective surgical procedures, blood utilization declined substantially while blood discards increased, resulting in substantial wastage of blood products. Ongoing and future pandemic response efforts should consider the impact of interventions on blood supply and demand to ensure blood availability. This article is protected by copyright.

Buffalopox was first described in India, later in other countries, and has become an emerging contagious viral zoonotic disease infecting milkers with high morbidity among affected domestic buffalo and cattle. BPXV is a member of the genus Orthopoxvirus and a close variant of the vaccinia virus (VACV). Recent genome data show that BPXV shares a most recent common ancestor of VACV Lister strain, which had been used for inoculating buffalo calves to produce a Smallpox vaccine. Over time, VACV evolved into BPXV by establishing itself in buffaloes to be increasingly pathogenic to this host and to make infections in cattle and humans. Together with the current pandemic of SARS-COV2/COVID 19, BPXV infections illustrate how vulnerable the human population is to the emergence and re-emergence of viral pathogens from unsuspected sources. In view that majority of the world population are not vaccinated against smallpox and are most vulnerable in the event of its re-emergence, reviewing and understanding the biology of vaccinia-like viruses are necessary for developing a new generation of safer smallpox vaccines in the smallpox-free world.","Eltom, Kamal H; Samy, Abdallah M; Abd El Wahed, Ahmed; Czerny, Claus-Peter",,227,13

Telehealth was considered adequate for many audiology services, although hearing assessment and device fitting by telehealth received least support. Matters related to timeliness of services and reduction of travel were reported as the main advantages, but relationships between practitioners and clients may suffer with telehealth. Important barriers were technologies related to the client or remote site; clinic-related items were moderate barriers, although more clinician training was a common theme provided through open-ended responses.

Psychopathological changes during the lockdown were detected and rated by clinicians. Rates of treatment discontinuation and reasons why were also recorded. RESULTS: Of 103 eligible patients, 81 answered the phone call and were included in the study. Mental symptoms were frequent but not as severe as expected. About 32% of patients in psychopharmacological treatment and almost 52% of patients in psychotherapy had discontinued treatment. Patients who were globally considered to have worsened if compared to their pre-coronavirus mental health conditions had in fact higher scores on several mental symptoms but mild specific fears about coronavirus issues, similar to those of patients improved or stable. Worsening was significantly associated with unemployment, lack of VISA, and treatment discontinuation. Shifting the way of providing psychotherapy into a web-based modality was significantly more frequent in stable/improved patients. CONCLUSION: Findings suggest that concrete life problems and treatment discontinuation more than the coronavirus fear, have predominantly affected the mental health conditions of our patients.","Aragona, Massimiliano; Tumiati, Maria Cristina; Ferrari, Federica; Viale, Sonia; Nicolella, Gianluca; Barbato, Angelo; Cavani, Andrea; Costanzo, Gianfranco; Mirisola, Concetta",Int J Soc Psychiatry,227,20
432770,432770,432770,A meta-analysis: The mortality and severity of COVID-19 among patients with mental disorders,18.900282,8.387879,2021,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is in Pandemic form and has affected people of 215 countries. It produces symptoms like fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat, headache, loss of taste, smell or appetite and many other rare symptoms. But the most important symptom is shortness of breath due to hypoxia. In a normal individual oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) is at least 95% and patient feels shortness of breath when SpO(2) falls below 90% with some exception. SARS-CoV-2, a newly emergent coronavirus has the peculiarity to produce silent hypoxia, meaning SpO 2< 90% or less like 80%, 70%, 60% without shortness of breath. Silent hypoxia can be diagnosed by monitoring SpO(2) with pulse oximeter. For management of COVID-19, early symptoms like fever & cough, SpO(2) should be monitored by pulse oximeter, followed by immediate correction of hypoxia by O-2 supplementation and prophylactic oral or injectable anticoagulant to prevent thromboembolism and thus death rate can be reduced. Case summary: A 72-year-old man presented with the complaints of fever and headache followed by cough, fatigue, anorexia, loss of taste and appetite in next few days but no shortness of breath. The patient was clinically diagnosed as a case of COVID-19 & positive result of Real time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test confirmed the diagnosis. From the first day, SpO(2) was regularly monitored with pulse oximeter and SpO(2) on day 1, it was 96-98%. On day 8, SpO(2) fell to 89-93%, pulse 96/min, respiratory rate>30/min, temperature 101o F, taste sensation was reduced. According to sign and symptoms, the patient was diagnosed as COVID-19 with severe pneumonia. Management was started at home with continuous monitoring, lying in prone position for 5-6 hours/day, supplemental oxygenation to maintain level of SpO(2) between 94-96%, injectable anticoagulant enoxaparin to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) was given. Prophylactic antibiotics and symptomatic treatment were also given. Results: According to this case report, patient's SpO(2) was monitored by pulse oximeter on first day;on day 08, SpO(2) fell to 89-93% & on day 10, further dropped to 85-88% which indicated severe pneumonia but there was no complaint of breathlessness as it was silent hypoxia. Sometimes the patient spent 30 minutes or more in toilet and SpO(2) used to fall to 82-83% without any subjective shortness of breath but with only mild heaviness of chest and cough. Therefore SpO(2) monitoring by pulse oximeter is essential in early diagnosis of silent hypoxia. Correction of hypoxia by supplemental oxygenation and prevention of VTE and DIC by using anticoagulant was the mainstay of treatment and patient had significant improvement on day 14. The patient was managed completely at home except X-ray being done in a hospital. Conclusion: Fall of SpO(2) in COVID-19 i.e. hypoxia (usually present as shortness of breath) or silent hypoxia can be diagnosed early by pulse oximeter or smart phone pulse oximetry apps. Early management by isolation, supplemental oxygenation and oral/injectable anticoagulation can prevent further events like Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), respiratory failure followed by multiple organ failure (that may cause death). The authors advocate further clinical trial and research.","Al Harun, M. A.; Hossain, M. M.; Bari, M. A.; Rubel, N. A. S.; Karim, M. E.; Siddiquee, N.; Hossain, M.

Between 12 January 2020 and 20 February 2020, the records of 124 consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed and divided into survivor (83/124) and non-survivor (41/124) groups. Chest CT findings were qualitatively compared on admission and serial chest CT scans were semi-quantitively evaluated between two groups using curve estimations. On admission, significantly more bilateral (97.6% vs. 73.5%, p = 0.001) and diffuse lesions (39.0% vs. 8.4%, p < 0.001) with higher total CT score (median 10 vs. 4, p < 0.001) were observed in non-survivor group compared with survivor group. Besides, crazy-paving pattern was more predominant in non-survivor group than survivor group (39.0% vs. 12.0%, p < 0.001). From the prediction of curve estimation, in survivor group total CT score increased in the first 20 days reaching a peak of 6 points and then gradually decreased for more than other 40 days (R2 = 0.545, p < 0.001). In non-survivor group, total CT score rapidly increased over 10 points in the first 10 days and gradually increased afterwards until ARDS occurred with following death events (R2 = 0.711, p < 0.001). In conclusion, persistent progression with predominant crazy-paving pattern was the major manifestation of COVID-19 in non-survivors.

We assessed whether the automatic classification of the content of calls to emergency medical communication centers could provide relevant and responsive indicators. METHODS: We retrieved all 796,209 free-text call reports from the emergency medical communication center of the Gironde department, France, between 2018 and 2020. We trained a natural language processing neural network model with a mixed unsupervised/supervised method to classify all reasons for calls in 2020. Validation and parameter adjustment were performed using a sample of 39,907 manually-coded free-text reports. RESULTS: The number of daily calls for flu-like symptoms began to increase from February 21, 2020 and reached an unprecedented level by February 28, 2020 and peaked on March 14, 2020, 3 days before lockdown. It was strongly correlated with daily emergency room admissions, with a delay of 14 days. Calls for chest pain and stress and anxiety, peaked 12 days later. Calls for malaises with loss of consciousness, non-voluntary injuries and alcohol intoxications sharply decreased, starting one month before lockdown. No noticeable trends in relation to lockdown was found for other groups of reasons including gastroenteritis and abdominal pain, stroke, suicide and self-harm, pregnancy and delivery problems. DISCUSSION: The first wave of the COVID-19 crisis came along with increased levels of stress and anxiety but no increase in alcohol intoxication and violence. As expected, call related to road traffic crashes sharply decreased. The sharp decrease in the number of calls for malaise was more surprising. CONCLUSION: The content of calls to emergency medical communication centers is an efficient epidemiological surveillance data source that provides insights into the societal upheavals induced by a health crisis. The use of an automatic classification system using artificial intelligence makes it possible to free itself from the context that could influence a human coder, especially in a crisis situation. The COVID-19 crisis and/or lockdown induced deep modifications in the population health profile.","Gil-Jardiné, Cédric; Chenais, Gabrielle; Pradeau, Catherine; Tentillier, Eric; Revel, Philippe; Combes, Xavier; Galinski, Michel; Tellier, Eric; Lagarde, Emmanuel",Scand J Trauma Resusc Emerg Med,227,16

METHODS: This nationwide retrospective cohort study included hospital data on all people hospitalized in France for diabetes in weeks 2-43 in 2020, including the COVID-19 lockdown period, compared to same period in 2019. RESULTS: The number of hospitalizations for DFU decreased significantly in weeks 12-19 (during the lockdown) (p < 10-4 ). Hospitalization for foot osteomyelitis also decreased significantly in weeks 12-19 (p < 10-4 ). The trend was the same for lower limb amputations and revascularizations associated with DFU or amputation. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: The marked drop in hospitalization rates for DFU, osteomyelitis and lower limb revascularization procedures in people with DFU observed in France during the lockdown period suggests that COVID-19 was a barrier to DFU care, and may illustrate the combined deleterious effects of hospital overload and changes in health-related behaviour.","Mariet, Anne-Sophie; Benzenine, Eric; Bouillet, Benjamin; Vergès, Bruno; Quantin, Catherine; Petit, Jean-Michel",Diabet Med,227,16

This study compares the impacts of standard air-purifying respirators and powered air-purifying respirators during simulated difficult airway scenarios. Twenty-five anaesthetists carried out four different standardised difficult intubation drills, either unprotected (control), or wearing a standard or a powered respirator. Treatment times and wearer comfort were determined and compared. In the wearer comfort evaluation form, operators rated mobility, noise, heat, vision and speech intelligibility. All anaesthetists accomplished the treatment objectives of all study arms without adverse events. Total mean (SD) intubation times for the four interventions did not show significant differences between the powered and the standard respirator groups, being 16.4 (8.6) vs. 19.2 (5.2) seconds with the Airtraq&#8482;; 11.4 (3.4) vs. 10.0 (2.1) seconds with the videolaryngoscope; 39.2 (4.5) vs. 40.1 (4.8) seconds with the fibreoptic bronchoscope scope; and 15.4 (5.7) vs. 15.1 (5.0) seconds for standard tracheal intubation by direct laryngoscopy, respectively. Videolaryngoscopy allowed the shortest intubation times regardless of the respiratory protective device used. Anaesthetists rated heat and vision significantly higher in the powered respirator group; however, noise levels were perceived to be significantly lower than in the standard respirator group. We conclude that standard and powered respirators do not significantly prolong simulated advanced intubation procedures.","Schumacher, J; Arlidge, J; Dudley, D; Sicinski, M; Ahmad, I",Anaesthesia,227,20

In the first category, generally, it is recom-mended that prenatal consultations should be continued, if necessary, by means of telemedi-cine; hospitalization of positive pregnant women in case symptoms are severe and consid-ering pregnant women's clinical and emotional aspects. In the second, screening and testing on suspected cases, discouraging skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding in the first hour of life. In the third, change the arrangement of beds in shared accommodations and have early discharge. In the fourth category, it is also recommended late clamping of the umbilical cord and observe differences in laboratorial testing of asymptomatic neonates. Conclusions: scientific evidence based on studies with methodological designs and more robust analyzes are necessary to guide perinatal care in the context of the harm-free COVID-19 pandemic.","Oliveira, Maysa Arlany de; Silva, Natácia Élem Felix; Pereira, Juliana de Castro Nunes; Oliveira, Mayara Amanda de; Silva, Suzana Lins da; Caminha, Maria de Fátima Costa; Paula, Weslla Karla Albuquerque Silva de; Quirino, Glauberto da Silva; Oliveira, Dayanne Rakelly de; Cruz, Rachel de Sá Barreto Luna Callou",Rev.

Unemployment is associated with increased risk of CVD, and so there is concern that the economic downturn associated with the COVID-19 pandemic will increase the CVD burden. AIMS: This modeling study aimed to quantify potential health loss, health cost burden and health inequities among people with CVD due to additional unemployment caused by COVID-19 pandemic-related economic disruption in one high-income country: New Zealand (NZ). METHODS: We adapted an established and validated multi-state life-table model for CVD in the national NZ population. We modeled indirect effects (ie, higher CVD incidence due to high unemployment rates) for various scenarios of pandemic-related unemployment projections from the NZ Treasury. RESULTS: We estimated the potential CVD-related heath loss in NZ to range from 23,300 to 36,900 health-adjusted life years (HALYs) for the different unemployment scenarios. Health inequities would be increased with the per capita health loss for Maori (Indigenous population) estimated to be 3.7 times greater than for non-Maori (49.9 vs 13.5 HALYs lost per 1000 people). The estimated additional health system costs ranged between (NZ$303 million [m] to 503m in 2019 values; or US$209m to 346m). CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS: Unemployment due to the COVID-19 pandemic could cause significant health loss, increase health inequities from CVD, and impose additional health system costs in this high-income country. Prevention measures should be considered by governments to reduce this risk, including additional job creation programs and measures directed towards the primary prevention of CVD.","Nghiem, Nhung; Wilson, Nick",PLoS One,227,21

The present study aimed to reveal risk factors associated with mental health problems and suggest concrete coping strategies in the context of COVID-19. METHODS: A web-based survey was conducted in July when Japan was experiencing a second wave of COVID-19. Demographics, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), state anger, anger control, and the Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced were measured. Multivariate logistic regression analysis on PHQ-9 scores by set variables was conducted. RESULTS: The participants were 2708 individuals, and 18.35% of them were depressed. Logistic regression analysis showed that in the order of odds ratios (ORs), underlying disease (OR = 1.96, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.32-2.92), not working (OR = 1.85, CI = 1.22-2.80), negative economic impact (OR = 1.33, CI = 1.01-1.77), state anger (OR = 1.17, CI = 1.14-1.21), anger control (OR = 1.08, CI = 1.04-1.13), age (OR = 0.97, CI = 0.96-0.98), high income (OR = 0.45, CI = 0.25-0.80), and being married (OR = 0.53, CI = 0.38-0.74) were predictors of depressive symptoms. Regarding coping strategies, planning (OR = 0.84, CI = 0.74-0.94), use of instrumental support (OR = 0.85, CI = 0.76-0.95), denial (OR = 0.88, CI = 0.77-0.99), behavioural disengagement (OR = 1.28, CI = 1.13-1.44), and self-blame (OR = 1.47, CI = 1.31-1.65) were associated with probable depression. CONCLUSIONS: During prolonged psychological distress caused by COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of depressive symptoms in Japan was two to nine times as high as before the COVID-19 pandemic, even though Japan was not a lockdown country. Although some coping strategies were useful for maintaining mental health, such as developing ways, alone or with others, to address or avoid social dislocations, the influence of demographics was more powerful than these coping strategies, and medical treatments are needed for high-risk individuals.","Fukase, Yuko; Ichikura, Kanako; Murase, Hanako; Tagaya, Hirokuni",BMC Psychiatry,227,21

Moreover, the deep and pervasive history of medical racism in the U.S. has created a context in which some racial and ethnic groups exhibit greater levels of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy; yet few researchers have attempted to determine whether these patterns persist with time. The purpose of this study was twofold: (a.) assess the role of time in COVID-19 vaccine intentions from April 2020 to January 2021, and (b.) examine whether race and ethnicity shape COVID-19 vaccine intention trajectories. Data were drawn from 9 waves of the Understanding America Study (nâ¯=â¯5023), a national probability panel study of U.S. adults. Multilevel logistic regression models were used to assess overall COVID-19 vaccine intention trajectories and trajectories by race and ethnicity. Results demonstrate intentions to get a COVID-19 vaccine significantly decreased from April 2020 to November 2020, but by January 2021, intentions to get a COVID-19 vaccine slightly increased. Findings also show trajectories significantly differed by racial and ethnic background. Asian/Pacific Islanders had the highest probability of likely getting a COVID-19 vaccine at baseline, followed by Whites and Latina/os. Black Americans exhibited the lowest probability of likely getting vaccinated, and, in most cases, the gap between Black Americans and other racial groups grew over time. Key findings from this study demonstrate that, among U.S. adults, time and race and ethnicity play significant roles in COVID-19 vaccine intentions. Understanding the role of time and race and racism in shaping COVID-19 vaccine intention trajectories can help government agencies and public health experts tasked with administrating vaccines better understand disparities in vaccine uptake.","Niño, Michael D; Hearne, Brittany N; Cai, Tianji",SSM Popul Health,227,16

We discuss a gentleman who presented with an atraumatic rupture of the spleen secondary to this infection. Brief summary of presentation: A 57-year-old service engineer was brought into the emergency department after having collapsed at home. RT-PCR was positive for covid-19 infection. CT scan showed evidence of haemoperitoneum and splenic rupture. He underwent splenic artery embolisation and required ventilatory and circulatory support on ITU. He made a full recovery and was discharged home 3â¯weeks later. Discussion and relevance: Atraumatic splenic rupture is a rare, potentially fatal condition which has been described as a complication of haematological and non-haematological malignancies, inflammatory disorders and infections. There is emerging evidence to suggest that covid-19 has a direct destructive impact on the spleen, causing lymphoid follicle attrition and nodular atrophy in addition to microvascular thrombosis and necrosis.

In such circumstances, prevention is all we have. The role of handwashing in the prevention of communicable diseases has been known for over a century, yet it remains severely neglected as a public health investment, to be periodically re-discovered during pandemic-scale infections. Over 26% of the global population has no access to a handwashing station in the home; for many low-income countries this proportion rises to over 50%. In other instances, the water is unaffordable or the supply has been shut off on account of unpaid bills. But when there is no water in the home or yard, or no mechanism for delivering enough water, good hand-washing is extremely difficult. Well before COVID-19, global cost-benefit analyses of water and sanitation investments, with benefits measured in time-savings as well as health, showed significant net benefits in all sub-regions of the developing world. This Viewpoint paper argues that, in the current crisis and its aftermath, it is imperative for governments and donors to prioritize and generously fund affordable, reliable, and accessible water services in underserved regions of the world.

Tribal populations in southern Rajasthan, India, live in extreme scarcity, rely mainly on outward migration for sustenance, and have been significantly affected by the pandemic. In this study, we assess the availability of foodstuffs at the household level and community experiences about satiety and hunger during lockdown. METHODOLOGY: We conducted a rapid assessment of food security in rural southern Rajasthan, India, using a structured questionnaire. Trained interviewers conducted telephonic interviews using KoBoToolbox, an open-source tool. A total of 211 respondents including community volunteers, family members of tuberculosis patients and malnourished children, pregnant women, and influential members in the villages participated in the study. RESULTS: A cereal was reported to be present by 97% of the respondents, two-thirds had pulses, and nearly half had milk. The amount of cereals available was adequate for about 5 months and that of pulses, oil/ ghee, and sugar for about 1 to 2 weeks. Two-thirds of the respondents reported that food in their households was sometimes not sufficient for the amount they wanted to eat, and 97% of these mentioned not having money to buy food as the reason for not having sufficient food. CONCLUSION: This study highlights widespread food insecurity among tribal communities in southern Rajasthan, and the scenario is likely to be similar in other tribal migration dependent areas of the country.","Saxena, Anupriya; Amin, Arpita; Mohan, Sanjana Brahmawar; Mohan, Pavitra",Food Nutr Bull,227,16

A total of 130 Israeli married women with children completed the survey during the lockdown restrictions period. All participants reported that their children were living with them during the lockdown, and that no one had been infected by the virus. The results indicated that fear of COVID-19 was negatively associated with SRH as well as marital satisfaction, and positively associated with psychological distress. In addition, psychological distress mediated the link between fear of COVID-19 and both SRH and marital satisfaction. To mitigate similar negative consequences in the future, it is suggested that interventions should focus on the way the crisis is presented in the public domain.

This study aimed to describe specific pathophysiological characteristics of acute respiratory distress syndrome from coronavirus disease 2019. DESIGN: Prospective crossover physiologic study. SETTING: ICU of a university-affiliated hospital from northern Italy dedicated to care of patients with confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019. PATIENTS: Ten intubated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome and confirmed diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019. INTERVENTIONS: We performed a two-step positive end-expiratory pressure trial with change of 10 cm H2O in random order. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At each positive end-expiratory pressure level, we assessed arterial blood gases, respiratory mechanics, ventilation inhomogeneity, and potential for lung recruitment by electrical impedance tomography. Potential for lung recruitment was assessed by the recently described recruitment to inflation ratio. In a subgroup of seven paralyzed patients, we also measured ventilation-perfusion mismatch at lower positive end-expiratory pressure by electrical impedance tomography. At higher positive end-expiratory pressure, respiratory mechanics did not change significantly: compliance remained relatively high with low driving pressure. Oxygenation and ventilation inhomogeneity improved but arterial CO2 increased despite unchanged respiratory rate and tidal volume. The recruitment to inflation ratio presented median value higher than previously reported in acute respiratory distress syndrome patients but with large variability (median, 0.79 [0.53-1.08]; range, 0.16-1.40). The FIO2 needed to obtain viable oxygenation at lower positive end-expiratory pressure was significantly correlated with the recruitment to inflation ratio (r = 0.603; p = 0.05). The ventilation-perfusion mismatch was elevated (median, 34% [32-45%] of lung units) and, in six out of seven patients, ventilated nonperfused units represented a much larger proportion than perfused nonventilated ones. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome from coronavirus disease 2019, potential for lung recruitment presents large variability, while elevated dead space fraction may be a specific pathophysiological trait. These findings may guide selection of personalized mechanical ventilation settings.","Mauri, Tommaso; Spinelli, Elena; Scotti, Eleonora; Colussi, Giulia; Basile, Maria Cristina; Crotti, Stefania; Tubiolo, Daniela; Tagliabue, Paola; Zanella, Alberto; Grasselli, Giacomo; Pesenti, Antonio",Crit.

We aimed to assess use of an antiseptic mouthwash as an antibiotic sparing approach to prevent STIs. METHODS: We invited people using PrEP who had an STI in the past 24 months to participate in this single-centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, AB/BA crossover superiority trial at the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp, Belgium. Using block randomisation (block size eight), participants were assigned (1:1) to first receive Listerine Cool Mint or a placebo mouthwash. They were required to use the study mouthwashes daily and before and after sex for 3 months each and to ask their sexual partners to use the mouthwash before and after sex. Participants were screened every 3 months for syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhoea at the oropharynx, anorectum, and urethra. The primary outcome was combined incidence of these STIs during each 3-month period, assessed in the intention-to-treat population, which included all participants who completed at least the first 3-month period. Safety was assessed as a secondary outcome. This trial is registered with Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03881007. FINDINGS: Between April 2, 2019, and March 13, 2020, 343 participants were enrolled: 172 in the Listerine followed by placebo (Listerine-placebo) group and 171 in the placebo followed by Listerine (placebo-Listerine) group. The trial was terminated prematurely because of the COVID-19 pandemic. 151 participants completed the entire study, and 89 completed only the first 3-month period. 31 participants withdrew consent, ten were lost to follow-up, and one acquired HIV. In the Listerine-placebo group, the STI incidence rate was 140·4 per 100 person-years during the Listerine period, and 102·6 per 100 person-years during the placebo period. In the placebo-Listerine arm, the STI incidence rate was 133·9 per 100 person-years during the placebo period, and 147·5 per 100 person-years during the Listerine period. We did not find that Listerine significantly reduced STI incidence (IRR 1·17, 95% CI 0·84-1·64). Numbers of adverse events were not significantly higher than at baseline and were similar while using Listerine and placebo. Four serious adverse events (one HIV-infection, one severe depression, one Ludwig's angina, and one testicular carcinoma) were not considered to be related to use of mouthwash. INTERPRETATION: Our findings do not support the use of Listerine Cool Mint as a way to prevent STI acquisition among high-risk populations.

New pathogens in wastewater are constantly emerging. For example, SARS-CoV-2 has been recently detected in domestic sewage and primary sludge. Knowledge about the reduction of viruses in wastewater treatment and their partitioning between the treated liquid effluent versus the sludge or biosolids is still very scarce, especially in countries with emerging economies and tropical climates. Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors are among the top three most commonly used technologies for the treatment of sewage in Latin America and the Caribbean, and their use has become increasingly common in many other low- and middle-income countries. High-rate algal ponds (HRAP) are regarded as a sustainable technology for the post-treatment of UASB effluent. This study evaluated the overall reduction and the liquid-solid partitioning of somatic coliphages, F-specific coliphages, and E. coli in a pilot-scale system comprised of a UASB reactor followed by HRAPs treating real wastewater. Average log removal for somatic and F-specific coliphages were 0.40 and 0.56 for the UASB reactor, and 1.15 and 1.70 for HRAPs, respectively. The overall removal of both phages in the system was 2.06-log. Removal of E. coli was consistently higher. The number of viruses leaving the system in the UASB solids and algal biomass was less than 10% of the number leaving in the clarified liquid effluent. The number of E. coli leaving the system in solids residuals was estimated to be approximately one order of magnitude higher than the number of E. coli leaving in the liquid effluent. Results from this study demonstrate the suitability of UASB-HRAP systems to reduce viral and bacterial indicators from domestic sewage and the importance of adequately treating sludge for pathogen reduction before they are used as biosolids.","Espinosa, Maria Fernanda; Verbyla, Matthew E; Vassalle, Lucas; Rosa-Machado, Alcino Trindade; Zhao, Fei; Gaunin, Anaïs; Mota, César Rossas",Sci Total Environ,227,33

A retrospective cohort study,19.265028,8.404483,2021,"Background: Approximately half of the reported laboratory-confirmed infections of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have occurred in healthcare settings, and healthcare workers constitute over one third of all secondary infections. This study aimed to describe secondary cases of MERS-CoV infection among healthcare workers and to identify risk factors for death. Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted on epidemiological data of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to the World Health Organization from September 2012 to 2 June 2018. We compared all secondary cases among healthcare workers with secondary cases among non-healthcare workers. Multivariable logistic regression identified risk factors for death. Results: Of the 2223 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO, 415 were healthcare workers and 1783 were non-healthcare workers. Compared with non-healthcare workers cases, healthcare workers cases were younger (P &lt; 0.001), more likely to be female (P &lt; 0.001), non-nationals (P &lt; 0.001) and asymptomatic (P &lt; 0.001), and have fewer comorbidities (P &lt; 0.001) and higher rates of survival (P &lt; 0.001). Year of infection (2013–2018) and having no comorbidities were independent protective factors against death among secondary healthcare workers cases. Conclusion: Being able to protect healthcare workers from high threat respiratory pathogens, such as MERS-CoV is important for being able to reduce secondary transmission of MERS-CoV in healthcare-associated outbreaks. By extension, reducing infection in healthcare workers improves continuity of care for all patients within healthcare facilities.","Elkholy, Amgad A.; Grant, Rebecca; Assiri, Abdullah; Elhakim, Mohamed; Malik, Mamunur R.; Van Kerkhove, Maria D.",J.

We can estimate when sustained disease transmission will end in a population by calculating the population-specific basic reproduction number [R]0, the expected number of secondary cases generated by an infected person in the absence of any interventions. The value of [R]0 relates to a herd immunity threshold (HIT), which is given by 1 - 1/[R]0. When the immune fraction of a population exceeds this threshold, sustained disease transmission becomes exponentially unlikely (barring mutations allowing SARS-CoV-2 to escape immunity). Here, we report state-level [R]0 estimates obtained using Bayesian inference. Maximum a posteriori estimates range from 7.1 for New Jersey to 2.3 for Wyoming, indicating that disease transmission varies considerably across states and that reaching herd immunity will be more difficult in some states than others. [R]0 estimates were obtained from compartmental models via the next-generation matrix approach after each model was parameterized using regional daily confirmed case reports of COVID-19 from 21-January-2020 to 21-June-2020. Our [R]0 estimates characterize infectiousness of ancestral strains, but they can be used to determine HITs for a distinct, currently dominant circulating strain, such as SARS-CoV-2 variant Delta (lineage B.1.617.2), if the relative infectiousness of the strain can be ascertained. On the basis of Delta-adjusted HITs, vaccination data, and seroprevalence survey data, we find that no state has achieved herd immunity as of 20-September-2021. Significance StatementCOVID-19 will continue to threaten non-immune persons in the presence of ongoing disease transmission. We can estimate when sustained disease transmission will end by calculating the population-specific basic reproduction number [R]0, which relates to a herd immunity threshold (HIT), given by 1 - 1/[R]0. When the immune fraction of a population exceeds this threshold, sustained disease transmission becomes exponentially unlikely. Here, we report state-level [R]0 estimates indicating that disease transmission varies considerably across states. Our [R]0 estimates can also be used to determine HITs for the Delta variant of COVID-19. On the basis of Delta-adjusted HITs, vaccination data, and serological survey results, we find that no state has yet achieved herd immunity.","Mallela, Abhishek; Neumann, Jacob; Miller, Ely F; Chen, Ye; Posner, Richard G; Lin, Yen Ting; Hlavacek, William S",,227,21

It is a fatty acid salt obtained from the reaction of a strong base with a fatty substance of animal (tallow) or plant origin (oil). This reaction is called saponification. Syndets, on the other hand, are much more recent and have been in use for about a century. In the case of liquid syndets, they are mainly alkyl sulphates and their derivatives alkyl ether sulphates while isethionates and sarcosinates are more commonly found in solid syndets. Synthetic soaps and detergents are surfactants and, as such, they have detergent properties. The way soap works accounts for its antimicrobial properties. Thanks to its amphiphilic structure, it is able to interact with the lipid membranes of microorganisms (viruses, bacteria, etc.) and inactivate them. In this coronavirus pandemic period, health authorities worldwide recommend hand washing with soap and water. We therefore wanted to provide a summary of the chemical characteristics and applications of soaps, on the one hand, and synthetic detergents, on the other. Soap is not the only product used for hand hygiene and, given the current situation, alternatives are complex and varied.","Coiffard, L; Couteau, C",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,227,21

The objectives of this study were to understand mothers' SARS-CoV-2 vaccine intentions to explore reasons for and against SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. METHODS: Participants from the All Our Families pregnancy longitudinal cohort whose children had reached ages 9-12 years were invited in May-June 2020 to complete a survey on the impact of COVID-19. The survey covered topics about the impact of the pandemic and included 2 specific questions on mothers' intentions to vaccinate their child against SARS-CoV-2. Current responses were linked to previously collected data, including infant vaccine uptake. Multinomial regression models were run to estimate associations between demographic factors, past vaccination status and vaccination intention. Qualitative responses regarding factors affecting decision-making were analyzed thematically. RESULTS: The response rate was 53.8% (1321/2455). A minority of children of participants had partial or no vaccinations at age 2 (n = 200, 15.1%). A total of 60.4% of mothers (n = 798) intended to vaccinate their children with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine, 8.6% (n = 113) did not intend to vaccinate and 31.0% (n = 410) were unsure. Lower education, lower income and incomplete vaccination history were inversely associated with intention to vaccinate. Thematic analysis of qualitative responses showed 10 themes, including safety and efficacy, long-term effects and a rushed process. INTERPRETATION: Within a cohort with historically high infant vaccination, a third of mothers remained unsure about vaccinating their children against SARS-CoV-2. Given the many uncertainties about future SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, clear communication regarding safety will be critical to ensuring vaccine uptake.","Hetherington, Erin; Edwards, Sarah A; MacDonald, Shannon E; Racine, Nicole; Madigan, Sheri; McDonald, Sheila; Tough, Suzanne",CMAJ Open,227,6

While older children using tablets to read has been more broadly investigated, less is known about the impacts of digital reading on children at the stage of literacy acquisition. An analytical review was conducted on the effects of interactive e-book interventions for young children's literacy development when compared to (a) listening to print books, (b) regular school programs, and (c) reading non-enhanced and non-interactive e-books. A significant additional beneficial effect of e-book interventions was found for phonological awareness and vocabulary learning based on data from 1138 children in 14 randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies. When e-books are properly selected and used, children develop literacy skills equally well and sometimes better than with print books. Additionally, e-book interventions outperformed the regular school program in the development of literacy skills. Similarly, enhanced e-book conditions revealed benefits over the non-enhanced e-book interventions in literacy skill acquisition. The impact of these findings related to health issues, e-book design, disadvantaged populations, and adult-led e-book sharing is discussed.","López-Escribano, Carmen; Valverde-Montesino, Susana; García-Ortega, Verónica",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),227,26

The authors hypothesized that the Covid-19 pandemic would create a gender gap in perceived work productivity and job satisfaction. This is because when couples are working from home the whole day and when schools are closed, women are expected to devote more time to housework and childcare.Design/methodology/approachThe authors used a sample of employed women and men from dual-career families who were working from home since Covid-19 lockdowns started. In total, 286 US-resident full-time employees participated in this study. Participants were asked to report their work productivity and job satisfaction before and since Covid-19 lockdowns.FindingsIt is found that before the Covid-19 pandemic, there were no gender differences in self-rated work productivity and job satisfaction. However, during the lockdown, women reported lower work productivity and job satisfaction than men.Research limitations/implicationsParticipants retrospectively reported their work productivity and job satisfaction before Covid-19. However, there are unlikely to be systematic gender differences in retrospective reports of these measures. Further, the authors only sampled opposite-sex dual career parents. Future research needs to examine the effects of lockdowns on women and men in other types of households.Practical implicationsGiven the nature of the Covid-19 pandemic, many regions might experience multiple periods of lockdown, and many workplaces have already adopted or are likely to adopt long-term work-from-home policies. The findings indicate that these long-term changes in the workplace might have long-term negative effects on women’s perceived productivity and job-satisfaction in dual-career families.Social implicationsThe findings suggest that society needs provide additional support to women working from home and taking care of children or other dependents, particularly during lockdowns or during times when schools and daycare centers are closed.Originality/valueThe current research is one of the first to claim that despite the greater amount of time that women spend in housework and childcare than men, during normal times, they are as productive and as satisfied with their job as men. However, the Covid-19 pandemic increased women’s housework and childcare beyond a threshold, thereby creating a gender gap in work productivity and job satisfaction.","Feng, Zhiyu Savani Krishna",Gender in Management,227,14

However, due to limited contact, adequate rehabilitation is difficult to provide for quarantined patients. Telerehabilitation technology could be a solution; however, issues specific to COVID-19 should be taken into consideration, such as strict quarantine and respiratory symptoms, as well as accessibility to deal with rapid increases in need due to the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop and to investigate the feasibility of a telerehabilitation system for patients who are quarantined due to COVID-19 by combining existing commercial devices and computer applications. METHODS: A multidisciplinary team has identified the requirements for a telerehabilitation system for COVID-19 and developed the system to satisfy those requirements. In the subsequent feasibility study, patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (N=10; mean age 60 years, SD 18 years) were included. A single session of telerehabilitation consisted of stretching exercises, a 15-minute exercise program, and a video exercise program conducted under real-time guidance by a physical therapist through a video call. The system included a tablet computer, a pulse oximeter, videoconferencing software, and remote control software. The feasibility of the system was evaluated using the Telemedicine Satisfaction Questionnaire (TSQ; 14 items) and an additional questionnaire on the telerehabilitation system (5 items). Each item was rated from ""1 = strongly disagree"" to ""5 = strongly agree."" RESULTS: The telerehabilitation system was developed by combining existing devices and applications, including a pulse oximeter and remote control mechanism, to achieve user-friendliness, affordability, and safety, which were determined as the system requirements. In the feasibility study, 9 out of 10 patients were able to use the telerehabilitation system without any on-site help. On the TSQ, the mean score for each item was 4.7 (SD 0.7), and in the additional items regarding telerehabilitation, the mean score for each item was 4.3 (SD 1.0). CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the feasibility of this simple telerehabilitation system in quarantined patients with COVID-19, encouraging further investigation on the merit of the system's use in clinical practice.","Mukaino, Masahiko; Tatemoto, Tsuyoshi; Kumazawa, Nobuhiro; Tanabe, Shigeo; Katoh, Masaki; Saitoh, Eiichi; Otaka, Yohei",JMIR Rehabil Assist Technol,227,1

In this context, COVID-19 mortality with confirmed diagnosis becomes an attractive source of information to be included in the analysis of perspectives and proposals. Objective data are required to calculate the capacity of resources provided by health systems. New strategies are needed to stabilize or minimize the mortality surge. However, we will not afford this goal until more alternatives were available. We still need an effective treatment, an affordable vaccine, or a collective achievement of sufficient immunity (reaching up to 70% of the whole population). At any time, the arriving waves of the pandemic are testing the capacity of governments. The health services struggle to keep the plateau in a steady-state below 100 deaths per million inhabitants. Therefore, it is necessary to increase the alternatives and supplies based on the current and near-future expected demands imposed by the number of deaths by COVID-19. Estimating COVID-19 mortality in various scenarios with the gradual release of social constraints will help predict the magnitude of those arriving waves.","Delgado, Carlos A; Shimabuku, Roberto L; Chiroque-Solano, Pamela M",Tohoku J Exp Med,227,20

Microfluidics offers considerable advantages for their manufacture due to its scalability, reproducibility and fast preparation. Thus, in this study, we have evaluated operating and formulation parameters to be considered when developing LNPs. Among them, the flow rate ratio (FRR) and the total flow rate (TFR) have been shown to significantly influence the physicochemical characteristics of the produced particles. In particular, increasing the TFR or increasing the FRR decreased the particle size. The amino lipid choice (cationic-DOTAP and DDAB; ionisable-MC3), buffer choice (citrate buffer pH 6 or TRIS pH 7.4) and type of nucleic acid payload (PolyA, ssDNA or mRNA) have also been shown to have an impact on the characteristics of these LNPs. LNPs were shown to have a high (>90%) loading in all cases and were below 100 nm with a low polydispersity index (&#8804;0.25).

This report describes the case of a 17-year-old male with a history of vaping cannabis during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Michigan. Report: A previously healthy 17-year-old male presented with cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, fever, and hypoxia requiring 40L high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) and 100% FiO2 to maintain oxyhemoglobin saturations of 88%. He showed no tachypnea or retractions, mimicking the “happy hypoxia” reported in COVID-19 patients. His physical exam demonstrated inspiratory crackles and migratory diminished breath sounds. Chest x-ray showed mild peri-bronchial thickening, subtle right perihilar opacities, and hyperexpansion. Bloodwork showed a procalcitonin of 10 nanograms/milliliter, ESR of 10 millimeters/hour, and CRP of 3.5 milligrams/deciliter. Three prior SARS-CoV2 tests were negative, but given clinical suspicion, the patient was treated as a Patient Under Investigation (PUI) for COVID-19 for 48 hours and re-tested. Care was aligned with institutional COVID-19 guidelines to minimize aerosol-generating procedures;diagnostic bronchoscopy, positive pressure ventilation, and transport for chest CT were discouraged, especially as our patient was awake, interactive, and with gradually improving trajectory. Infection prevention guidelines prohibited our patient's parents from leaving his room for a private interview, but friends alerted them to a history of vaping cannabis, which our patient corroborated. He was transitioned towards supportive care for EVALIinduced bronchoconstriction and improved with beta agonists, systemic steroids, and HFNC. After his fourth negative SARS CoV2 test, the patient underwent a high-resolution chest CT, which showed diffuse ground-glass opacities with subpleural sparing. He was discharged after four days with Pediatric Pulmonology follow up. He was counseled against further e-cigarette or cigarette use. Discussion: This case illustrates challenges in the diagnosis of EVALI during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly among adolescents. Both conditions present with acute respiratory failure absent another source. Both can have significant hypoxia, elevated inflammatory markers, and an ARDS phenotype. Both demonstrate ground-glass opacities on CT scan. Importantly, here are differences in the workup, management, and public health implications of EVALI and COVID-19. Both are reportable to the Department of Public Health and warrant intervention: Anti-vaping campaigns and restriction on access for EVALI, infection control and immunization programs for COVID-19. As the world endeavors to contain the COVID-19 pandemic through surveillance, treatment, and immunization, we also hope to regain momentum against EVALI.","Clarke, R. G.; Saba, T.; Flori, H.

However, the contribution of each dose to the generation of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and the degree of protection against novel variants, including delta, warrant further study. Here, we investigated the B cell response to the BNT162b2 vaccine by integrating repertoire analysis with single-cell transcriptomics of B cells from serial blood collections pre- and post-vaccination. The first vaccine dose elicits highly mutated IgA+ plasmablasts against the S protein subunit S2 at day 7, suggestive of recall of a memory B cell response generated by prior infections with heterologous coronaviruses. On day 21, we observed minimally-mutated IgG+ activated switched memory B cells targeting the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein, likely representing a primary response derived from naive B cells. The B cell response against RBD is specifically boosted by the second vaccine dose, and encodes antibodies that potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus and partially neutralize novel variants, including delta. These results demonstrate that the first vaccine dose activates a non-neutralizing recall response predominantly targeting S2, while the second vaccine dose is vital to boosting neutralizing anti-S1 RBD B cell responses.","Brewer, R Camille; Ramadoss, Nitya S; Lahey, Lauren J; Robinson, William H; Lanz, Tobias V",,227,30

However, mRNA's short cytoplasmic half-life limits its utility to therapeutic applications amenable to repeated dosing or short-term overexpression. Here, we describe a biomaterial that enables a durable in vivo response to a single mRNA dose via an ""overexpress and sequester"" mechanism, whereby mRNA-transfected cells locally overexpress a growth factor that is then sequestered within the biomaterial to sustain the biologic response over time. In a murine diabetic wound model, this strategy demonstrated improved wound healing compared to delivery of a single mRNA dose alone or recombinant protein. In addition, codelivery of anti-inflammatory proteins using this biomaterial eliminated the need for mRNA chemical modification for in vivo therapeutic efficacy. The results support an approach that may be broadly applicable for single-dose delivery of mRNA without chemical modification.","Khalil, Andrew S; Yu, Xiaohua; Umhoefer, Jennifer M; Chamberlain, Connie S; Wildenauer, Linzie A; Diarra, Gaoussou M; Hacker, Timothy A; Murphy, William L",Sci.

However, current US immigration laws-and their enforcement-not only fail to fulfill migrants' health rights but actively undermine their realization and worsen the pandemic's spread.Specifically, the US immigration system's reliance on detention, which precludes effective social distancing, increases risks of exposure and infection for detainees, staff, and their broader communities. International agreements clearly state that the prolonged, mandatory, or automatic detention of people solely because of their migration status is a human rights violation on its own. But in the context of COVID-19, the consequences for migrants' right to health are particularly acute.Effective alternatives exist: other countries demonstrate the feasibility of adopting and implementing immigration laws that establish far less restrictive, social services-based approaches to enforcement that respect human rights.

Two phenomena observed so far in the development of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic deserve further attention. First, the relative absence of clinical signs of infections in children, second, the early appearance of IgG in certain patients. From the point of view of immune system physiology, such an early rise of specific IgG is expected in secondary immune responses when memory to a cross-reactive antigen is present, usually from an earlier infection with a coronavirus. It is actually typical for the immune system to respond, to what it already knows, a phenomenon that has been observed in many infections with closely related viruses and has been termed ""original antigenic sin."" The question then arises whether such cross-reactive antibodies are protective or not against the new virus. The worst scenario would be when such cross-reactive memory antibodies to related coronaviruses would not only be non-protective but even enhance infection and the clinical course. Such a phenomenon of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE) has already been described in several viral infections. Thus, the development of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 in the course of COVID-19 might not be a simple sign of viral clearance and developing protection against the virus. On the contrary, due to cross-reaction to related coronavirus strains from earlier infections, in certain patients IgG might enhance clinical progression due to ADE. The patient's viral history of coronavirus infection might be crucial to the development of the current infection with SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, it poses a note of caution when treating COVID-19 patients with convalescent sera.","Fierz, Walter; Walz, Brigitte",Front Immunol,227,7

Thailand announced the first confirmed case outside mainland China in January 2020. The disease also spread widely across Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Gastrointestinal manifestations could be presenting symptoms of COVID-19. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 patients in Thailand and review important aspects of this disease in ASEAN. Methods: Thai patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at Thammasat University Hospital, Thailand, were evaluated between 1 January 2020 and 30 April 2020. Patients' data, clinical presentation, exposure risk, past medical history, laboratory results, and treatment outcomes were extensively reviewed. Results: A total of 352 COVID-19 tests were performed, and 40 patients with positive tests were studied. The mean age was 30.5 years, and 55% were female. Most (82.5%) had no underlying diseases. Comorbidities were associated with severe COVID-19 (odds ratio [OR] 29.93; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.31–388.40, P = 0.009). Gastrointestinal symptoms were present in 12 patients (30%). The most common presenting symptoms were anorexia (17.5%) and diarrhea (15%). Gastrointestinal symptoms developed before (9.1%), concurrent with (63.6%), and after (27.3%) respiratory symptoms.

An international comparison of potentially inappropriate treatments allows insight into common issues and country-specific challenges of end-of-life care in nursing homes and helps direct health care policy in this area. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the prevalence of potentially inappropriate treatments in the last week of life in nursing home residents, and analyze the differences in prevalence between countries. METHODS: A cross-sectional study of deceased residents in nursing homes (2015) in six European countries: Belgium (Flanders), England, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands and Poland. Potentially inappropriate treatments included: enteral administration of nutrition, parental administration of nutrition, artificial fluids, resuscitation, artificial ventilation, blood transfusion, chemotherapy/radiotherapy, dialysis, surgery, antibiotics, statins, antidiabetics, new oral anticoagulants. Nurses were questioned about whether these treatments were administered in the last week of life. RESULTS: We included 1,384 deceased residents from 322 nursing homes. In most countries, potentially inappropriate treatments were rarely used, with a maximum of 18.3% of residents receiving at least one treatment in Poland. Exceptions were antibiotics in all countries (between 11.3% in Belgium and 45% in Poland), artificial nutrition and hydration in Poland (54.3%) and Italy (41%) and antidiabetics in Poland (19.7%). CONCLUSION: Although the prevalence of potentially inappropriate treatments in the last week of life was generally low, antibiotics were frequently prescribed in all countries. In Poland and Italy, the prevalence of artificial administration of food/fluids in the last week of life was high, possibly reflecting country differences in legislation, care organization and culture, and the palliative care competences of staff.","Honinx, Elisabeth; Van den Block, L; Piers, R; Van Kuijk, S M J; Onwuteaka-Philipsen, B D; Payne, S; Szczerbinska, K; Gambassi, G G; Finne-Soveri, H; Deliens, L; Smets, T",J. pain symptom manage,227,1

This seems to be largely explained by the relationship between facial appearance and body adiposity, a trait that affects various aspects of body homeostasis, including fertility and immunity. The aim of this study was to test if, a part of adipose tissue amount, also levels of hormones secreted by adipose tissue are reflected in women's appearance, focusing on the two most abundant adipokines. Due to the opposing effects of adiponectin and leptin on health, we hypothesized that leptin negatively and adiponectin positively correlate with women's attractiveness. METHODS: The study sample included 174 young, healthy women (Mage = 28.50, SDage = 2.38). Serum leptin and adiponectin levels were measured. Estradiol (E2), testosterone (T), and BMI levels were controlled in the analyses. Face photographs were taken and facial attractiveness ratings, assessed by men, were gathered in online questionnaires. RESULTS: Perceived facial attractiveness correlated negatively with leptin level and leptin/adiponectin ratio, but did not correlate with adiponectin level. The results were similar, when controlled for E2, T, and BMI. Adipokines levels did not mediate or moderate the relationship between facial attractiveness and BMI. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that perceived facial attractiveness is predicted by adipose-derived hormones detrimental for health, like leptin, but is not related with beneficial hormones, such as adiponectin. However, the levels of these two adipokines do not impact the relationship between perceived facial attractiveness and adiposity, and thus do not explain the relationship between facial attractiveness, body adiposity, and biological condition.","Zelazniewicz, Agnieszka; Nowak, Judyta; Studzinska, Ida; Pawlowski, Boguslaw",Am J Phys Anthropol,227,22

As maternity care providers consider what prenatal care delivery changes we should maintain following the acute pandemic, we may gain insight from understanding the evolution of prenatal care delivery guidelines. In this paper, we start by sketching out the relatively unstructured beginnings of prenatal care in the 19th century. Most medical care fell within the domain of laypeople, and childbirth was a central feature of female domestic culture. We explore how early discoveries about ""toxemia"" created the groundwork for future prenatal care interventions, including screening of urine and blood pressure-which in turn created a need for routine prenatal care visits. We then discuss the organization of the medical profession, including the field of obstetrics and gynecology. In the early 20th century, new data increasingly revealed high rates of both infant and maternal mortalities, leading to a greater emphasis on prenatal care. These discoveries culminated in the first codification of a prenatal visit schedule in 1930 by the Children's Bureau. Surprisingly, this schedule remained essentially unchanged for almost a century. Through the founding of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, significant technological advancements in laboratory testing and ultrasonography, and calls of the National Institutes of Health Task Force for changes in prenatal care delivery in 1989, prenatal care recommendations continued to be the same as they had been in 1930-monthly visits until 28 weeks' gestation, bimonthly visits until 36 weeks' gestation, and weekly visits until delivery. However, coronavirus disease 2019 forced us to change, to reconsider both the need for in-person visits and frequency of visits. Currently, as we transition from the acute pandemic, we should consider how to use what we have learned in this unprecedented time to shape future prenatal care. Lessons from a century of prenatal care provide valuable insights to inform the next generation of prenatal care delivery.","Peahl, Alex F; Howell, Joel D",Am. j. obstet. gynecol,227,13

However, lung epithelial cells are increasingly recognized as active effectors of microbial defence, contributing to both innate and adaptive immune function in the lower respiratory tract. These cells express an ample repertoire of pattern recognition receptors with specificity for conserved microbial and host motifs. Modern molecular techniques have uncovered the complexity of the lower respiratory tract microbiome. The interaction between the microbiota and the airway epithelium is key to understanding how stable immune homeostasis is maintained. Loss of epithelial integrity following exposure to infection can result in the onset of inflammation in susceptible individuals and may culminate in lung disease. Here we discuss the current knowledge regarding the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which the pulmonary epithelium interacts with the lung microbiome in shaping immunity in the lung. Specifically, we focus on the interactions between the lung microbiome and the cells of the conducting airways in modulating immune cell regulation, and how defects in barrier structure and function may culminate in lung disease. Understanding these interactions is fundamental in the search for more effective therapies for respiratory diseases.","Invernizzi, Rachele; Lloyd, Clare M; Molyneaux, Philip L",Immunology,227,20

The fundamental effect appears when two independent and indistinguishable photons are superimposed on a beam splitter, which achieves a complete suppression of coincidences between the two output ports. Much less studied, however, is when the fields share coherence (continuous-wave lasers) or mode envelope properties (pulsed lasers). In this case, we expect the existence of two distinct and concurrent HOM interference regimes: the traditional HOM dip on the coherence length time scale, and a structured HOM interference pattern on the pulse length scale. We develop a theoretical framework that describes HOM interference for laser fields having arbitrary temporal waveforms and only partial overlap in time. We observe structured HOM interference from a continuous-wave laser via fast polarization modulation and time-resolved single photon detection fast enough to resolve these structured HOM dips.","Agne, Sascha; Jin, Jeongwan; Kuntz, Katanya B; Miatto, Filippo M; Bourgoin, Jean-Philippe; Jennewein, Thomas",Opt Express,227,21

PURPOSE: To provide an overview of compounding under sections 503A and 503B of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and to describe the pharmacist's role within the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Compounding Incidents Program, whose efforts are aimed at protecting the public against poor-quality compounded drugs through surveillance, review and response to adverse events and complaints. SUMMARY: Compounded drugs may serve an important medical need for patients who cannot be treated with medications approved by FDA; however, compounded drugs are not approved by FDA and are not subject to premarket review for safety, efficacy, or manufacturing quality; thus, they may pose safety risks to patients. Prompt reporting of adverse events or complaints related to compounding is important in identifying these risks and implementing safeguards to protect the public. FDA's Compounding Incidents Program consists of a team of pharmacists dedicated to the surveillance and review of adverse events and complaints and follow-up actions related to safety risks associated with compounded drugs. Pharmacists are a vital component of FDA's Compounding Incidents Program, utilizing their clinical skill set and regulatory knowledge to review and act on safety issues that affect public health. CONCLUSION: As FDA continues to expand the Compounding Incidents Program and its efforts to protect the public against poor-quality compounded drugs, we encourage the continued submission of adverse event reports by healthcare professionals and consumers to FDA's MedWatch reporting system in addition to adverse event reporting compliance by outsourcing facilities.","Janusziewicz, Ashlee N; Glueck, Shannon N; Park, Sophia Y; Nguyen, Dien N; Rimmel, Susan C; Cascio, Laurelle A; Doh, Gina Y; Martin-Yeboah, Garrette F",Am. j. health system pharm,227,24

Access to scientifically correct information can assist patients in early detection or prevention of the disease. However, misinformation on social networking sites (SNSs) about breast cancer can be propagated rapidly, posing a threat to health communication efforts. The aim of this study is to analyse the characteristics of the most shared news stories referencing the disease that circulated on SNSs, including the credibility of this content. METHODS: This is an exploratory quali-quantitative study. Data collection was conducted between June 2019 and June 2020. We performed statistical and content analysis of the stories that had at least 1,000 total shares. Each story was classified in accordance to the following aspects: credibility; type of rumour; source; content type; mentions prevention or early detection/screening exams. RESULTS: The abundance of news stories in our sample (n = 1,594) were not classified according to their credibility, as they do not address science, risk factors, prevention, treatment, or other aspects which can be assessed for scientific accuracy. However, content classified as ""rumours"" are 3.29 times more shared than those considered scientifically correct. Regarding content type, most stories are classified as 'real-life story' or 'solidarity' (67.69%). In our sample, 5.08% of the total comment on prevention and 19.7% reference early detection. CONCLUSION: We consider it can be a good strategy, in SNSs, to combine content of greater popularity, such as real-life stories, with subjects that can make a difference in a patient's life, such as early detection, breast cancer symptoms and disease prevention strategies.

After two reported case studies of imaging findings during daily computed tomography (CT)-based image-guided radiotherapy (RT) scans, a call for submission of anonymized case reports was published with the objective of rapidly determining if there was a correlation between the onset of new pulmonary infiltrates found during RT and COVID-19. We hereby report the results of the aggregate analysis. METHODS: Data of deidentified case reports for patients who developed biochemically confirmed COVID-19 during RT were submitted through an online portal. Information requested included a patient's sex, age, cancer diagnosis and treatment, and COVID-19 diagnosis and outcome. Coplanar CT-based imaging was requested to reveal the presence or absence of ground-glass opacities or infiltrates. RESULTS: A total of seven reports were submitted from Turkey, Spain, Belgium, Egypt, and the United States. Results and imaging from the patients reported by Suppli et al. and McGinnis et al. were included for a total of nine patients for analysis. All patients were confirmed COVID-19 positive using polymerase chain reaction-based methods or nasopharyngeal swabs. Of the nine patients analyzed, abnormalities consistent with ground-glass opacities or infiltrates were observed in eight patients. CONCLUSIONS: This is the largest case series revealing the potential use of CT-based image guidance during RT as a tool for identifying patients who need further workup for COVID-19. Considerations for reviewing image guidance for new pulmonary infiltrates and immediate COVID-19 testing in patients who develop new infiltrates even without COVID-19 symptoms are strongly encouraged.","Warren, Graham W; Lim, Vun-Sin; Chowdhary, Mudit; Marwaha, Gaurav; Abd Elbadee, Osama Mostafa; Kirakli, Esra Korkmaz; Billiet, Charlotte; Marin, Alexandra Giraldo; Ramos, Monica; Suppli, Morten Hiul; McGinnis, Gwendolyn J; Adjei, Alex A",J. thorac. oncol,227,20

This leads to continual violations of individual privacy, as sensitive health records are put at risk in unmasked maps. New approaches to geographic masking are required that foster accessibility and ease of use, such that they become more widely adopted. This article describes a new geographic masking method, called street masking, that reduces the burden on users of finding supplemental population data by instead automatically retrieving OpenStreetMap data and using the road network as a basis for masking. We compare it to donut geomasking, both with and without population density taken into account, to evaluate its efficacy against geographic masks that require slightly less and slightly more supplemental data. Our analysis is performed on synthetic data in three different Canadian cities. RESULTS: Street masking performs similarly to population-based donut geomasking with regard to privacy protection, achieving comparable k-anonymity values at similar median displacement distances. As expected, distance-based donut geomasking performs worst at privacy protection. Street masking also performs very well regarding information loss, achieving far better cluster preservation and landcover agreement than population-based donut geomasking. Distance-based donut geomasking performs similarly to street masking, though at the cost of reduced privacy protection. CONCLUSION: Street masking competes with, if not out-performs population-based donut geomasking and does so without requiring any supplemental data from users.

Xanthines, including caffeine and pentoxifylline, are attractive candidates for drug repurposing, given their well-established safety and pharmacological profiles. This study aimed to analyze potential interactions between xanthines and aromatic antibiotics (i.e., tetracycline and ciprofloxacin), and their impact on antibiotic antibacterial activity. UV-vis spectroscopy, statistical-thermodynamical modeling, and isothermal titration calorimetry were used to quantitatively evaluate xanthine-antibiotic interactions. The antibacterial profiles of xanthines, and xanthine-antibiotic mixtures, towards important human pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae were examined. Caffeine and pentoxifylline directly interact with ciprofloxacin and tetracycline, with neighborhood association constant values of 15.8-45.6 M-1 and enthalpy change values up to -4 kJ·M-1. Caffeine, used in mixtures with tested antibiotics, enhanced their antibacterial activity in most pathogens tested. However, antagonistic effects of caffeine were also observed, but only with ciprofloxacin toward Gram-positive pathogens. Xanthines interact with aromatic antibiotics at the molecular and in vitro antibacterial activity level. Given considerable exposure to caffeine and pentoxifylline, these interactions might be relevant for the effectiveness of antibacterial pharmacotherapy, and may help to identify optimal treatment regimens in the era of multidrug resistance.","Woziwodzka, Anna; Krychowiak-Masnicka, Marta; Golunski, Grzegorz; Felberg, Anna; Borowik, Agnieszka; Wyrzykowski, Dariusz; Piosik, Jacek",Molecules (Basel),227,2

Nonetheless, adherence to exercise is low and travel costs and time may limit participation and compliance. Training at home can help avoid these burdens and, as needed during the recent global pandemic (COVID-19), reinforce social distancing and reduce the risk of infection. However, training at home requires motivation and self-control and telerehabilitation is time-consuming for both patient and therapist. In recent years, there is growing use of virtual reality and exergaming to increase motivation and adherence for exercising with evidence of improvements in mobility and balance after using virtual reality in the clinic. Here, a novel telerehabilitation training program using a treadmill-virtual reality system for simultaneous training of two patients with Parkinson disease in their homes is described. Remote monitoring software enabled visual and auditory communication with the two patients, allowing the trainer to adapt the settings remotely and provide feedback. Participants received weekly training sessions over 1 yr. The findings show high adherence to training, increased walking duration throughout the sessions, and increased patient confidence, gait speed, and mobility. Training multiple participants simultaneously was feasible, enabling an individualized treatment approach while conserving therapist time.","Cornejo Thumm, Pablo; Giladi, Nir; Hausdorff, Jeffrey M; Mirelman, Anat",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,227,26

Several shortcomings in the existing infectious disease management system were exposed during the pandemic, which hindered the control of the disease globally. To cope with this issue, we propose a window‐period framework to reveal the general rule of the progression of management of infectious diseases and to help with decision making at the early stage of epidemics with a focus on healthcare provisions. METHODS: The framework has two significant periods (dark‐window period and bright‐window period). Outbreak of COVID‐19 in China was used as an example for the application of the framework. RESULTS: The framework could reflect the progression of the epidemic objectively. The spread increased slowly in the dark‐window period, but rocketed up in the bright‐window period. The beginning of the bright‐window period was the time when healthcare personnel were exposed to a substantially high risk of nosocomial infection. Additionally, proper and prompt preventive actions during the dark‐window and bright‐window periods were substantially important to reduce the future spreading of the disease. CONCLUSIONS: It was recommended that when possible healthcare provisions should upgrade to the highest level of alert for the control of an unknown epidemic in the dark‐window period, while countermeasures in the bright‐window period could be accordingly adjusted with full exploration and considerations. The framework may provide some insights into how to accelerate the control of future epidemics promptly and effectively.","Li, Ziyi; Li, Cheng; Wu, Xinyin; Li, Guanming; Li, Guowei; Tian, Junzhang",Int J Clin Pract,227,5

PATIENTS AND METHODS: This 8-month prospective study of 14 patients with hospital-acquired SARS in Taipei, Taiwan, was conducted from April through December 2003. RESULTS: The most common presenting symptoms in our 14 patients with hospital-acquired SARS were fever, dyspnea, dizziness, malaise, diarrhea, dry cough, muscle pain, and chills. Lymphopenia and elevated serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were the most common initial laboratory findings. Initial chest radiographs revealed various pattern abnormalities and normal results. Five of the 14 patients required mechanical ventilation. The need for mechanical ventilation was associated with bilateral lung involvement on the initial chest radiograph and higher peak levels of LDH and CRP. Clinical severity of disease varied from mild to severe. At 8 months after disease onset, patients with mild or moderate SARS had normal findings or only focal fibrosis on chest high-resolution computed tomography. However, bilateral fibrotic changes remained in the 4 patients who had recovered from severe SARS, 1 of whom had mild restrictive ventilatory impairment. One patient with severe SARS died; she was elderly and had other comorbidities. Five additional patients had reduced diffusing capacity. CONCLUSION: The clinical picture of our patients presenting with hospital-acquired SARS revealed atypical pneumonia associated with lymphopenia, elevated serum levels of LDH, rapid clinical deterioration, and lack of response to empirical antibiotic therapy. Substantially elevated levels of LDH and CRP correlated with severe illness requiring mechanical ventilatory support. In those receiving mechanical ventilation, pulmonary function was only mildly reduced at 6 to 8 months after acute illness, consistent with the natural history of acute respiratory distress syndrome due to other causes.","Chiang, Chi-Huei; Shih, Jen-Fu; Su, Wei-Juin; Perng, Reury-Perng",Mayo Clin Proc,227,11

METHODS: In this cohort study, we captured the data encompassing the first wave of the pandemic in Scotland, from March 1, 2020, when the first case was identified, to July 31, 2020, when infection rates had dropped sufficiently that shielding measures were officially terminated. The participants were the total population of Scotland, including all people with diabetes who were alive 3 weeks before the start of the pandemic in Scotland (estimated Feb 7, 2020). We ascertained how many people developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in this period from the Electronic Communication of Surveillance in Scotland database (on virology), the RAPID database of daily hospitalisations, the Scottish Morbidity Records-01 of hospital discharges, the National Records of Scotland death registrations data, and the Scottish Intensive Care Society and Audit Group database (on critical care). Among people with fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19, diabetes status was ascertained by linkage to the national diabetes register, Scottish Care Information Diabetes. We compared the cumulative incidence of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with and without diabetes using logistic regression. For people with diabetes, we obtained data on potential risk factors for fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 from the national diabetes register and other linked health administrative databases. We tested the association of these factors with fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with diabetes, and constructed a prediction model using stepwise regression and 20-fold cross-validation. FINDINGS: Of the total Scottish population on March 1, 2020 (n=5 463 300), the population with diabetes was 319 349 (5·8%), 1082 (0·3%) of whom developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 by July 31, 2020, of whom 972 (89·8%) were aged 60 years or older. In the population without diabetes, 4081 (0·1%) of 5 143 951 people developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19. As of July 31, the overall odds ratio (OR) for diabetes, adjusted for age and sex, was 1·395 (95% CI 1·304–1·494; p<0·0001, compared with the risk in those without diabetes. The OR was 2·396 (1·815–3·163; p<0·0001) in type 1 diabetes and 1·369 (1·276–1·468; p<0·0001) in type 2 diabetes. Among people with diabetes, adjusted for age, sex, and diabetes duration and type, those who developed fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 were more likely to be male, live in residential care or a more deprived area, have a COVID-19 risk condition, retinopathy, reduced renal function, or worse glycaemic control, have had a diabetic ketoacidosis or hypoglycaemia hospitalisation in the past 5 years, be on more anti-diabetic and other medication (all p<0·0001), and have been a smoker (p=0·0011). The cross-validated predictive model of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 in people with diabetes had a C-statistic of 0·85 (0·83–0·86). INTERPRETATION: Overall risks of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19 were substantially elevated in those with type 1 and type 2 diabetes compared with the background population. The risk of fatal or critical care unit-treated COVID-19, and therefore the need for special protective measures, varies widely among those with diabetes but can be predicted reasonably well using previous clinical history.

The nephropathogenic IBV strains cause nephritis and kidney lesions intrinsically and the pathogenic mechanism is still unclear. In the present study, SPF chicks were infected with three nephropathogenic IBVs of different virulence and their gene expression profiles in chicken kidney were compared at transcriptome level. As a result, 1279 differentially expressed (DE) genes were found in very virulent SCDY2 inoculated group, 145 in virulent SCK2 group and 74 in non-virulent LDT3-A group when compared to mock infected group. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis on SCDY2 group displayed that the up-regulated DE genes were mainly involved in cell apoptosis, and the down-regulated genes were involved in metabolic processes and DNA replication. Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) analysis showed that DE genes in SCDY2 group formed a network, and the core of the network was composed by cell apoptosis and immune response proteins. The clustering of gene expression profile among the three virus inoculated groups indicated that the majority of up-regulated DE genes on apoptosis in very virulent SCDY2 group were up-regulated more or less in virulent SCK2 group and those down-regulated on innate immune response in SCDY2 group were also down-regulated differently in SCK2 group. In addition, the number of apoptotic cells detected experimentally in kidney tissue were very different among the three virus inoculated groups and were positively accordant with the viral titer, kidney lesions and viral virulence of each group. Taken all together, the present study revealed that virulent nephropathogenic IBV infection modified a number of gene expression and induction of apoptosis in kidney cells may be a major pathogenic determinant for virulent nephropathogenic IBV.","Liu, Hui; Yang, Xin; Zhang, Zhikun; Li, Jianan; Zou, Wencheng; Zeng, Fanya; Wang, Hongning",Microb Pathog,227,16

This region is a subset of nine states, including Memphis, Tennessee (project site), driving the epidemic in the United States. Memphis ranks 4th among all U.S. MSAs for new HIV infections and has been identified in the CDC's Ending the HIV Epidemic Initiative as a high HIV burden geographic focus area. The Memphis Ryan White Part A Program conducted a pilot project among adults seeking services in Memphis emergency and transitional housing shelters to offer on-site, rapid HIV testing. In this paper we describe the results from this aforementioned pilot study, including the rate of HIV test acceptance and potential factors associated with a history of HIV testing in Memphis. Methods: Community-engaged research approaches were employed via a partnership between the local health department, a federally qualified faith-based health center, and an academic university. An interviewer-administered survey to measure potential factors associated with HIV testing history and voluntary HIV testing services were offered to adults living in transitional housing establishments. Bivariate chi-square analyses were performed to determine the association between predisposing, enabling, and need variables with HIV testing history in the past 12 months. Results: Survey respondents (n = 109) were mostly cisgender male (n = 96; 88.1%), African American (n = 79; 72.5%) and reported engaging in condomless sex in the past 12 months (n = 55; 50.5%). Acceptability and uptake of HIV testing was high (n = 97; 89.0%). Conclusions: Implementing rapid HIV testing programs outside of traditional health care settings is a strategy that can be used to engage high-risk individuals and those unaware of their HIV status to get tested. To our knowledge, this study represents the first that documents HIV testing acceptance rates offered outside of traditional health care settings for homeless and transitionally housed adults in a Deep Southern state.","Pichon, Latrice C.; Rossi, Kristen Rae; Chapple-McGruder, Theresa; Krull, Lisa Jane; Kmet, Jennifer; Carswell, April L.",Front Public Health,227,1

Advanced echocardiographic techniques such as speckle-tracking imaging and three-dimensional (3D) echocardiography proved to be accurate tools for RV assessment, but their clinical significance remains to be clarified. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of two-dimensional (2D) RV strain and 3D ejection fraction (RVEF) in predicting adverse outcome in patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). We prospectively screened 81 patients with DCM and sinus rhythm, 50 of whom were enrolled and underwent comprehensive echocardiography, including RV strain and 3D RV volumetric assessment. Patients were followed for a composite endpoint of cardiac death, nonfatal cardiac arrest and acute worsening of HF requiring hospitalization. After a median follow-up of 16 months, 29 patients reached the primary endpoint. Patients with events had more impaired RV global longitudinal strain (− 10.5 ± 4.5% vs. − 14.3 ± 5.2%, p = 0.009), RV free wall longitudinal strain (− 12.9 ± 8.7% vs. − 17.5 ± 7.1%, p = 0.046) and 3D RVEF (38 ± 8% vs. 47 ± 9%, p = 0.001). By Cox proportional hazards multivariable analysis, RV global longitudinal strain and RVEF were independent predictors of outcome after adjustment for age and NYHA class. RVEF remained the only independent predictor of events after further correction for echocardiographic risk factors. By receiver-operating characteristic analysis, the optimal RVEF cut-off value for event prediction was 43.4% (area under the curve = 0.768, p = 0.001). Subjects with RVEF > 43.4% showed more favourable outcome compared to those with RVEF < 43.4% (log-rank test, p < 0.001). In conclusion, 3D RVEF is an independent predictor of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with DCM.","Vîjîiac, Aura; Onciul, Sebastian; Guzu, Claudia; Verinceanu, Violeta; Bătăilă, Vlad; Deaconu, Silvia; Scărlătescu, Alina; Zamfir, Diana; Petre, Ioana; Onuţ, Roxana; Scafa-Udriste, Alexandru; Vătășescu, Radu; Dorobanţu, Maria",Int J Cardiovasc Imaging,227,16

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to investigate symptoms of fear, depression, and anxiety due to the COVID-19 pandemic among college students in India. METHODS: This cross-sectional web-based study was conducted using a Google Forms questionnaire. The Google Form included a sociodemographic questionnaire and psychometric scales evaluating the psychological and behavioral impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, both qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed in the study. RESULTS: A total of 324 college students participated in this study, of whom 180 (55.6%) were male and 144 (44.4%) were female. After assessment of the psychometric scales, it was found that of the 324 students, 223 (68.8%) had high fear of COVID-19, 93 (28.7%) had moderate to severe depression, and 167 (51.5%) had mild to severe anxiety. Among the identified risk factors, having a family member who was infected with COVID-19 was significantly associated with anxiety and depression, with P values of .02 and .001, respectively. In addition, the correlations of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 were found to be 0.492 and 0.474, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This research concludes that there is a very high fear of COVID-19 among students, along with anxiety and depression symptoms. This study also concludes that the Fear of COVID-19 Scale has a moderate positive correlation with the anxiety and depression scales, respectively.","Chaudhary, Amar Prashad; Sonar, Narayan Sah; TR, Jamuna; Banerjee, Moumita; Yadav, Shailesh",JMIRx Med,227,30

The models will divide the populations of both countries in three categories: the subpopulation susceptible to be infected of the disease, the subpopulation which is already infected and thus is infectious, and the subpopulation which has already recovered from the disease so is considered immune. The transmission rate is calculated within these models while considering the different locations and, more importantly, the lockdown measures implemented during 2020. The efficiency of these measures is compared between the areas of infection and the different levels of lockdown. ABSTRACT: Two discrete mathematical SIR models (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) are proposed for modelling the propagation of the SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) through Spain and Italy. One of the proposed models is delay-free while the other one considers a delay in the propagation of the infection. The objective is to estimate the transmission, also known as infectivity rate, through time taking into account the infection evolution data supplied by the official health care systems in both countries. Such a parameter is estimated through time at different regional levels and it is seen to be strongly dependent on the intervention measures such as the total (except essential activities) or partial levels of lockdown. Typically, the infectivity rate evolves towards a minimum value under total lockdown and it increases again when the confinement measures are partially or totally removed.","Nistal, Raul; de la Sen, Manuel; Gabirondo, Jon; Alonso-Quesada, Santiago; Garrido, Aitor J.; Garrido, Izaskun",Biology (Basel),227,26

In this work, we use magnetic-based localization. As Earth’s geomagnetic field is stable in time and is not affected by nonmagnetic materials, such as a large number of people in the robot’s surroundings, magnetic-based localization is ideal for service robotics in supermarkets, hotels, etc. A common approach for magnetic-based localization is to first create a magnetic map of the environment where the robot will be deployed. For this, magnetic samples acquired a priori are used. To generate this map, the collected data is interpolated by training a Gaussian Process Regression model. Gaussian processes are nonparametric, data-drive models, where the most important design choice is the selection of an adequate kernel function. These models are flexible and generate mean predictions as well as the confidence of those predictions, making them ideal for their use in probabilistic approaches. However, their computational and memory cost scales poorly when large datasets are used for training, making their use in large-scale environments challenging. The purpose of this study is to: (i) enable magnetic-based localization on large-scale environments by using a sparse representation of Gaussian processes, (ii) test the effect of several kernel functions on robot localization, and (iii) evaluate the accuracy of the approach experimentally on different large-scale environments.","Takebayashi, Takumi; Miyagusuku, Renato; Ozaki, Koichi",Sensors (Basel),227,6

This organism was isolated as an endophyte from a cinnamon tree that had been introduced to Honduras from Sri Lanka in the early part of the last century. Characteristically, the original Muscodor albus, and all of its species isolated since that time are non-spore producers and each one exudes a characteristic spectrum of volatile bioactive compounds. The majority have a whitish mycelium, which is sometimes coiling, intertwined and decorated with variously shaped structures. Presently, there are at least 22 type species known/documented and each has been described as an endophyte from various plant families with widely varying habitats. An enormous variety of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are produced by Muscodor spp. and some of these include esters, acids, aldehydes, ketones, aromatics, alkanes, alcohols, nitrosamides and terpenoids. The VOCs are both inhibitory and lethal to a wide variety of fungi and bacteria including some major pathogens of plants and humans. Interestingly, in almost all cases studied, no one compound by itself can mimic the bioactivity of the complete gas mixture, suggesting that the volatiles are acting in a synergistic manner and this has been tested with individual as well as the VOCs in various mixtures and concentrations. This review will discuss some of the recent findings in all aspects of this unique fungal genus whilst at the same time pointing out some of the major questions that remain about its biology, ecology and its applications in agriculture, medicine and other sectors. Most importantly, the authors provide arguments supporting the claim that Muscodor is taxonomically distinct from Induratia, a recently proposed change to its nomenclature.","Saxena, Sanjai; Strobel, Gary A.",Microb Ecol,227,1

In this study, we evaluated changes in endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in a cohort of convalescent COVID-19 patients undergoing pulmonary rehabilitation (PR). Methods: After swab test negativization, convalescent COVID-19 patients referring to a post-acute care facility for PR were consecutively screened for inclusion. Study procedures were performed at the time of hospitalization and discharge. Results: We enrolled 82 convalescent COVID-19 patients (85.4% males, mean age 60.4 years). After PR, a significant improvement in most pulmonary function tests and exercise capacity was documented. FMD changed from 2.48% ± 2.01 to 4.24% ± 2.81 (p < 0.001), corresponding to a 70.9% increase. Significantly higher changes in FMD were found in patients without a history of vascular events as compared to those with (+2.04% ± 2.30 vs. +0.61% ± 1.83, p = 0.013). Values of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV(1)%), forced vital capacity (FVC%) and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO%) significantly and directly correlated with FMD both at baseline and after PR. Patients with normal FEV(1)% (≥80% predicted) during the overall study period or those normalizing FEV(1)% after PR showed a more significant FMD change as compared to patients with persistently impaired FEV(1)% (<80% predicted) (p for trend = 0.029). This finding was confirmed in a multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Clinically evaluated endothelial function improves after PR in convalescent COVID-19 patients. A direct and persistent association between the severity of pulmonary and vascular disease can be hypothesized. Endothelial function testing may be useful in the follow-up of convalescent COVID-19 patients.","Ambrosino, Pasquale; Molino, Antonio; Calcaterra, Ilenia; Formisano, Roberto; Stufano, Silvia; Spedicato, Giorgio Alfredo; Motta, Andrea; Papa, Antimo; Di Minno, Matteo Nicola Dario; Maniscalco, Mauro",Biomedicines,227,16

We included original research, systematic reviews, and meta-analyses on the topic of food insecurity and cardiometabolic risk published from January 1, 2017, to December 31, 2020. Editorials, perspectives, and case reports were excluded. After the initial search, 3 reviewers selected studies for inclusion based on relevance and methods. Ultimately, fifty studies were included. RECENT FINDINGS: We included 35 studies of adults (20 cross-sectional observational studies, 5 longitudinal observational studies, 5 interventional studies, and 5 meta-analyses/reviews). In adults, food insecurity is associated with greater prevalence of overweight/obesity (especially for women). It is also associated with hypertension, diabetes (including worse glycemic control and more diabetes complications), coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, and chronic kidney disease. We included 15 studies of children (11 cross-sectional observational studies and 4 longitudinal observational studies). In children, findings were more nuanced, and in particular, many studies did not find an association between food insecurity and overweight/obesity. However, authors noted that these conditions may not have had time to develop. With notable exceptions, many studies were cross-sectional, and there were few interventions. SUMMARY: There is a robust association between food insecurity and cardiometabolic conditions and risk factors in adults, but the picture is less clear in children. Overt cardiometabolic clinical conditions develop more rarely in children, but childhood experiences may set a trajectory for worse health later in life. Detailed life course epidemiologic studies are needed to better understand this relationship. Future interventions should examine how to reduce the prevalence of food insecurity, and how best to improve health for those who experience food insecurity.","Te Vazquez, Jennifer; Feng, Shi Nan; Orr, Colin J.; Berkowitz, Seth A.",Curr Nutr Rep,227,29

Background Low socioeconomic status predisposes individuals to worse health outcomes. For example, during the 2003 SARS-CoV pandemic and the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic disadvantaged individuals were more likely to become infected. More recently, a study found that deaths due to COVID-19 were associated with disadvantaged areas across the United States. South Florida, in particular Broward and Miami-Dade Counties, has experienced a significant burden of coronavirus cases. Investigating the association of income on coronavirus cases in Broward and Miami-Dade Counties may aid in identifying and treating those individuals at increased risk. Methods This retrospective cross-sectional study used data gathered by the Florida Department of Health and 2018 U.S. Census. COVID-19 cases from March 2 - November 1, 2020 were tallied by ZIP code in Florida’s Broward and Miami-Dade Counties and scaled per housing unit. An exhaustive regression analysis using County “Miami-Dade” or “Broward,” sex, race, ethnicity, median age, and estimated per capita income was performed for each combination of independent variables in MATLAB (MathWorks, Natick, USA). Regression models were evaluated using both adjusted R-squared and the Akaike Information Criterion, along with the number of significant predictors. The most optimal model with the highest number of significant predictors was selected. Results Among all other variables, sex, race, and ethnicity as the variables that best predicted COVID-19 cases per housing unit within a certain ZIP code. The adjusted R-squared of this optimal model was 0.5062, indicating that within each ZIP code in Broward and Miami-Dade Counties 50.62% of the variance in COVID-19 cases per housing unit can be explained by these variables. A significant relationship was found between the number of COVID-19 cases and individuals who were Black or African American (p < 0.001), individuals who were Hispanic or Latino (p < 0.001), and male to female ratio (p = 0.016). Per capita income, age, and county were not statistically significant predictors in any model tested. Conclusions Racial and gender disparities may be more significant contributors to COVID-19 cases than per capita income in housing units. Based on the results of this study, investigators may consider applying this model to similar variables in order to inform the management and prevention of cases in the present and future pandemics.","Taylor, Lindsey A; Sheehan, Jarrod; Paz, Ariel; Tromer, Monica; Pieper, Erica; Squires, Iman; Nuhuman, Aysha; Santos, Radleigh; Jacobs, Robin J",Cureus,227,1

Patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), often treated with immunosuppressants, might be at higher risk of developing COVID‐19 and of demonstrating a severe disease course. We aimed to study prevalence and describe features of COVID‐19 in MG patients. METHODS: In May 2020, we conducted telephonic interviews with MG patients followed at our referral center. We collected structured data regarding MG and COVID‐19, which was diagnosed as probable or confirmed according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control case definition. We compared confirmed‐COVID‐19 prevalence calculated from the beginning of the pandemic in MG patients with that of the overall Pavia district. RESULTS: We interviewed 162 MG patients (median age, 66 y; interquartile range 41‐77; males 59.9%), 88 from the Pavia district. Three patients had SARS‐CoV‐2‐confirmed by polymerase chain reaction and eight had probable‐COVID‐19. In the Pavia district, the prevalence of confirmed‐COVID‐19 among MG patients (1/88, 1.14%) and overall population (4777/546 515, 0.87%) did not differ (P = .538). Higher Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America clinicalclass and the need for recent rescue treatment, but not ongoing immunosuppressive treatments, were associated with COVID‐19 risk. Of 11 MG patients with probable/confirmed‐COVID‐19, 3 required ventilator support, and 2 elderly patients died of COVID‐19 respiratory insufficiency. Only 1 of11 patients experienced worsening MG symptoms, which improved after increasing their steroid dose. DISCUSSION: The risk of COVID‐19 in MG patients seems to be no higher than that of the general population, regardless of immunosuppressive therapies. In our cohort, COVID‐19 barely affected MG course.","Businaro, Pietro; Vaghi, Gloria; Marchioni, Enrico; Diamanti, Luca; Arceri, Sebastiano; Bini, Paola; Colombo, Elena; Cosentino, Giuseppe; Alfonsi, Enrico; Costa, Alfredo; Ravaglia, Sabrina; Mallucci, Giulia; Ballante, Elena; Franciotta, Diego; Gastaldi, Matteo",Muscle Nerve,227,14

The 5- and 10-year cumulative survival rates were 93.6 and 91.0% in group 1 and 96.5 and 94.2% in group 2 patients, respectively (log-rank test p = 0.048). Infection accounted for more than half of the deaths in both groups. More group 1 than group 2 patients died of vascular events, but the difference was not statistically significant. Cox regression showed that the age of SLE onset and damage score accrued at 10 years, but not the time period in which SLE was diagnosed, were significantly associated with mortality. Conclusions: The improvement in survival of our SLE patients is probably related to the accrual of less organ damage in the past 15 years.","Mok, Chi Chiu; Ho, Ling Yin; Chan, Kar Li; Tse, Sau Mei; To, Chi Hung",Front Med (Lausanne),227,5

With social distancing, telemedicine may become the preferred communication channel between caregivers and patients. Implications for cerebral palsy (CP) children are that this will pose a challenge within this transformation. CP, as a discreet entity, is not considered a risk factor. However, specific comorbidities in individuals with CP, such as chronic lung disease, are known as COVID-19 risk factors. The overall risk for the CP population is probably a factor of age and comorbidities. Staying at home for CP children is both a challenge and an opportunity. Escalation of behavioral conflicts or improved participation and equality within the household may emerge. Interestingly, restricted mobility for the general population narrows existing gaps of ambulation. Telemedicine is the primary way of providing services for chronic conditions during the pandemic and is expected to expand beyond pre-Coronavirus era use. The advantages of telemedicine vary, more so during pandemic times, according to severity, restrictions, and availably of telemedicine. A multidisciplinary therapeutic presence is more accessible with telemedicine, bringing together various specialties and approaches to the child's natural environment. Accessible, continuous care is expected to lower comorbidities, as demonstrated for other chronic conditions. Enhanced monitoring is crucial for younger children as devastating complications, such as hip dysplasia, could be minimized. Last but not least, we will discuss digital health care as an accelerator for participatory medicine, including networked patients and families, as responsible drivers of their health as full partners.","Ben-Pazi, Hilla; Beni-Adani, Liana; Lamdan, Ron",Front Neurol,227,16

We assessed the availability of WASH and standard precautions for infection prevention in health facilities across 18 countries in sub-Saharan Africa, as well as inequalities by location (rural/urban) and managing authority (public/private). Data from health facility surveys conducted between 2013 and 2018 in 18 sub-Saharan African countries were used to estimate the access to an improved water source within 500 m, an improved toilet, soap and running water or alcohol-based hand rub, and standard precautions for infection prevention at health facilities. Rural-urban differences and public-private differences in access to services were calculated. We also compared population level access to health facility access to services. RESULT: Overall, 16,456 health facilities from 18 countries were included. Across countries, an estimated 88 % had an improved water source, 94 % had an improved toilet, 74 % had soap and running water or alcohol-based hand rub, and 17 % had standard precautions for infection prevention available. There was wide variability in access to water, sanitation and hygiene services between rural and urban health facilities and between public and private facilities, with consistently lower access in both rural and public facilities. In both rural and urban areas, access to water, sanitation and hygiene services was ubiquitously better at health facilities than households. CONCLUSIONS: Availability of WASH services in health facilities in sub-Saharan Africa has improved but remains below the global target of 80 % in many countries. Ensuring adequate access to WASH services and enforcing adherence to safety and hygiene practices in health facilities will be essential to minimize the risk of COVID-19 transmission.","Kanyangarara, Mufaro; Allen, Savannah; Jiwani, Safia S; Fuente, David",BMC Health Serv Res,227,24

Scent dogs could support current testing strategies. METHODS: Ten dogs were trained for 8 days to detect SARS-CoV-2 infections in beta-propiolactone inactivated saliva samples. The subsequent cognitive transfer performance for the recognition of non-inactivated samples were tested on three different body fluids (saliva, urine, and sweat) in a randomised, double-blind controlled study. RESULTS: Dogs were tested on a total of 5242 randomised sample presentations. Dogs detected non-inactivated saliva samples with a diagnostic sensitivity of 84% (95% CI: 62.5–94.44%) and specificity of 95% (95% CI: 93.4–96%). In a subsequent experiment to compare the scent recognition between the three non-inactivated body fluids, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were 95% (95% CI: 66.67–100%) and 98% (95% CI: 94.87–100%) for urine, 91% (95% CI: 71.43–100%) and 94% (95% CI: 90.91–97.78%) for sweat, 82% (95% CI: 64.29–95.24%), and 96% (95% CI: 94.95–98.9%) for saliva respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The scent cognitive transfer performance between inactivated and non-inactivated samples as well as between different sample materials indicates that global, specific SARS-CoV-2-associated volatile compounds are released across different body secretions, independently from the patient’s symptoms. All tested body fluids appear to be similarly suited for reliable detection of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals.

Plant material extracts and green-synthesized nanoparticles are among the most promising options to address this problem. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the antibacterial properties of aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts of grapefruit peels as well as their inclusion in green-synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aqueous and hydroalcoholic extracts (80% v/v) were prepared, and the volume and mass yields were determined. The synthesis of AgNPs was done in an eco-friendly manner using AgNO(3) as a precursor. The nanoparticles were characterized by ultraviolet–vis spectrometry and photon cross-correlation spectroscopy. The antibacterial activity of the extracts was tested on three Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, clinical Enterococcus faecalis, and S. aureus) and two Gram-negative bacteria (two clinical Escherichia coli) using various concentrations of extracts (100, 50, 25, 12, and 5 mg/mL and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide as negative control). Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined using the microdilution method. Modulation of cefazoline and ampicillin on resistant E. coli and S. aureus strains was added to the mixture design response surface methodology with extreme vertices design, with the diameters of inhibition and the fractional inhibitory concentration index as responses and factors, respectively. The antibiotic, the ethanolic extract, and water varied from 0.1 MIC to 0.9 MIC for the first two and from 0 to 0.8 in proportion for the third. Validating the models was done by calculating the absolute average deviation, bias factor, and accuracy factor. RESULTS: The volume yield of the EE and aqueous extract (AE) was 96.2% and 93.8% (v/v), respectively, whereas their mass yields were 7.84% and 9.41% (m/m), respectively. The synthesized AgNPs were very uniform and homogeneous, and their size was dependent on the concentration of AgNO(3). The antibacterial activity of the two extracts was dose-dependent, and the largest inhibition diameter was observed for the Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus ATCC 6538; AE, 12; EE, 16), whereas AgNPs had a greater effect on Gram-negative bacteria. The MICs (mg/mL) of the AEs varied from 3.125 (S. aureus ATCC 6538) to 12.5 (E. coli 1 and E. coli 2), whereas the MICs of the EEs varied from 1.5625 (S. aureus 1, S. aureus ATCC 6538, and E. faecalis) to 6.25 (E. coli 1). There was a significant difference between the MICs of AEs and EEs (p=0.014). The MBCs (mg/mL) of the AEs varied from 12.5 (S. aureus ATCC 6538) to 50 (S. aureus 1), whereas those of the EEs varied from 6.25 (S. aureus 1) to 25 (E. coli 1 and E. faecalis). Ethanolic grapefruit extracts demonstrated an ability to modulate cefazolin on E. coli and S. aureus but were completely indifferent to ampicillin on E. coli. CONCLUSION: Grapefruit peel extracts and their AgNPs exhibit antibacterial properties that can be exploited for the synthesis of new antimicrobials and their EEs may be efficiently used synergistically with other antibiotics against bacteria with intermediate susceptibility.","Arsène, Mbarga M.

After the World Health Organization declared a pandemic in March 2020, the number of confirmed cases and deaths has continued to increase. This situation may be prolonged until an effective, tested, and safe treatment is available. COVID-19 can occur at any age. However, the maximum confirmed cases and deaths have occurred among the elderly. Particularly, the mental and physical health of the elderly aged above 60 and classified as high-risk groups is more vulnerable than other age groups, requiring more attention. Strong social restraint, social distancing, and quarantine measures to prevent the COVID-19 spread have raised concerns about their mental health. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze and identify the psychological concepts and protective factors that support and constitute these guidelines and strategies and prepare practical suggestions and guidelines to protect the mental health of the elderly during COVID-19. These discussions will facilitate a deeper understanding and expansion of these guidelines and strategies.

Understanding how to maximize the effectiveness of these policies while mitigating economic damage is essential. We develop a mathematical model with different levels of population health and economic risk to assess the impact of quarantine measures on deaths, hospitalizations, and economic output. Methods: We combine an extended SEIR model that has multiple levels of health risk and economic vulnerability with disease parameters for the COVID19 pandemic to study the effects of quarantine policies. We examine the dynamics of infectious disease transmission and its economic impact for one year. We populate our model with a baseline of 95.6 % of high-risk people and 85.6 % of low-risk people in quarantine. We use our model to simulate leaving the current quarantine restrictions in place indefinitely. We then assess a policy where quarantine restrictions for lower-risk groups are gradually relaxed. Finally, we simulate relaxing quarantine restrictions more quickly. To compare outbreak outcomes under the same quarantine policies using different disease parameters, we also perform a sensitivity analysis on the contagiousness of infected people, the strictness of social isolation measures, and the amount that public policymakers value the economy in setting quarantine restrictions. Findings: We first consider a baseline scenario with constant quarantine level, finding that in a population of 330,000,000 million, there are 32,023 deaths among those under 60 and 174,682 deaths among those over 60, there is a peak of 189,136 hospitalizations, and the economy relative to the beginning of the quarantine state is 1.4 % smaller. In the scenario where higher-risk people are strictly quarantined, and for others the quarantine is slowly relaxed, there are 63,776 deaths among those under 60, 85,880 deaths among those over 60, a peak of 341,321 hospitalizations, and the economy relative to the beginning of the quarantine state is 6% larger. In the scenario where quarantine is more quickly lifted, there are 25,720 deaths among those under 60, 214,718 deaths among those over 60, a peak of 341,321 hospitalizations, and economic output relative to the beginning of the quarantine state is 4.5 % smaller. Interpretation: Strict restrictions on high-risk patients and a gradual lifting of quarantine for low-risk patients results in a limited number of deaths and lesser economic damage. We recommend this kind of strategy, combined with policies lowering the contagiousness of the disease and making quarantine more tolerable and economically viable for individuals.","Goldsztejn, Uri; Schwartzman, David; Nehorai, Arye",,227,20

Data on the cardiovascular effects of amodiaquine are scarce, although transient effects on cardiac electrophysiology (electrocardiographic QT interval prolongation and sinus bradycardia) have been observed. We conducted an individual patient data meta-analysis to characterise the cardiovascular effects of amodiaquine and thereby support development of risk minimisation measures to improve the safety of this important antimalarial. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Studies of amodiaquine for the treatment or prevention of malaria were identified from a systematic review. Heart rates and QT intervals with study-specific heart rate correction (QTcS) were compared within studies and individual patient data pooled for multivariable linear mixed effects regression. The meta-analysis included 2,681 patients from 4 randomised controlled trials evaluating artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) containing amodiaquine (n = 725), lumefantrine (n = 499), piperaquine (n = 716), and pyronaridine (n = 566), as well as monotherapy with chloroquine (n = 175) for uncomplicated malaria. Amodiaquine prolonged QTcS (mean = 16.9 ms, 95% CI: 15.0 to 18.8) less than chloroquine (21.9 ms, 18.3 to 25.6, p = 0.0069) and piperaquine (19.2 ms, 15.8 to 20.5, p = 0.0495), but more than lumefantrine (5.6 ms, 2.9 to 8.2, p < 0.001) and pyronaridine (−1.2 ms, −3.6 to +1.3, p < 0.001). In individuals aged ≥12 years, amodiaquine reduced heart rate (mean reduction = 15.2 beats per minute [bpm], 95% CI: 13.4 to 17.0) more than piperaquine (10.5 bpm, 7.7 to 13.3, p = 0.0013), lumefantrine (9.3 bpm, 6.4 to 12.2, p < 0.001), pyronaridine (6.6 bpm, 4.0 to 9.3, p < 0.001), and chloroquine (5.9 bpm, 3.2 to 8.5, p < 0.001) and was associated with a higher risk of potentially symptomatic sinus bradycardia (≤50 bpm) than lumefantrine (risk difference: 14.8%, 95% CI: 5.4 to 24.3, p = 0.0021) and chloroquine (risk difference: 8.0%, 95% CI: 4.0 to 12.0, p < 0.001). The effect of amodiaquine on the heart rate of children aged <12 years compared with other antimalarials was not clinically significant. Study limitations include the unavailability of individual patient-level adverse event data for most included participants, but no serious complications were documented. CONCLUSIONS: While caution is advised in the use of amodiaquine in patients aged ≥12 years with concomitant use of heart rate–reducing medications, serious cardiac conduction disorders, or risk factors for torsade de pointes, there have been no serious cardiovascular events reported after amodiaquine in widespread use over 7 decades. Amodiaquine and structurally related antimalarials in the World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended dose regimens alone or in ACTs are safe for the treatment and prevention of malaria.","Chan, Xin Hui S.; Haeusler, Ilsa L.; Win, Yan Naung; Pike, James; Hanboonkunupakarn, Borimas; Hanafiah, Maryam; Lee, Sue J.; Djimdé, Abdoulaye; Fanello, Caterina I.; Kiechel, Jean-René; Lacerda, Marcus VG; Ogutu, Bernhards; Onyamboko, Marie A.; Siqueira, André M.; Ashley, Elizabeth A.; Taylor, Walter RJ; White, Nicholas J.",PLoS Med,227,1

Nevertheless, the incidence of this complication is unknown in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms. CASE SUMMARY: A 26-year-old female nurse, who had been taking oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) treatment for the last 2 years, developed mild COVID-19 symptoms (rhinitis and anosmia). She underwent isolation at home and was subsequently followed up with telehealth visits. Fifteen days after her initial presentation, she developed acute onset sudden dyspnoea. On physical examination, she was found to be tachycardic with normal pulse oximetry. The initial risk score for VTE was moderate and laboratory results showed increased D-dimer level without other relevant findings. Computed tomography pulmonary angiography was performed, which confirmed low-risk subsegmental pulmonary embolism. DISCUSSION: Venous thromboembolism in patients who present with severe COVID-19 symptoms has already been described in the literature; its incidence is greater in patients hospitalized in intensive care units. Efforts to prevent VTE based on risk scores are widely recognized. However, the relationship in patients who present with mild COVID-19 symptoms and VTE is still unknown. Recently, experts on this field have introduced thromboprophylaxis guidelines including ambulatory patients based on the severity of COVID-19 symptoms and pro-thrombotic risk. Our patient showed no major risk for developing VTE; therefore, the VTE could be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection or the eventual pro-thrombotic association with the concomitant use of OCPs.","Fiorini, Norberto B; Garagoli, Fernando; Bustamante, Rosana C; Pizarro, Rodolfo",Eur Heart J Case Rep,227,5

The objectives of the present study were to genetically characterize FMDV isolated from water buffaloes and study the biochemical and histopathological indicators of infected animals. Fifty-four water buffaloes of both sexes and different ages suffered from acute symptoms of FMD were clinically examined and randomly selected for inclusion in this study. Oral desquamated epithelial and oropharyngeal fluid samples have been tested for FMDV by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR). Tissue and serum samples were also collected from the diseased buffaloes and subjected to histopathological and biochemical analysis. Our findings showed that all examined samples were confirmed to be positive to FMDV serotype SAT-2 and were adjusted to be responsible for the recent disease outbreak in this study. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the circulating viruses were of the SAT-2 serotype, closely related to the lineage of lib12, topotype VII, with 98.9% identity. The new lineage of SAT-2 showed a high virulence resulting in the deaths of water buffaloes due to heart failure, confirmed by high serum levels of inflammatory and cardiac markers, including haptoglobin, ceruloplasmin, cardiac troponin I and creatine phosphokinase-MB, indicating an unfavorable FMD-infection prognosis.

This study gauges the impact of COVID-19 on optometry education and practices in India. METHODS: The impact of COVID-19 among key stakeholders of Indian optometry that included educators, students, and practitioners was surveyed. The content validity of the survey tool was achieved through a focused group discussion with experts. RESULTS: Of the 1408 responses, 118 were educators, 845 were students and 445 were practitioners. Post COVID-19 lock-down, a high percentage of students (96%) and educators (94%) were now using online mode of education to learn and teach. The blended learning methods were reported to be used by 81% of educators. Practical skills were the most difficult to teach by educators and to learn by students. Almost a third of the students were concerned about their internships and job opportunities amid the pandemic. Practitioners felt confident in performing routine eye examinations with personal protective equipment (PPE). Telemedicine was found to be adopted by 55% of the private practitioners and 49% of the eye hospitals. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has provided an opportunity to reform Indian optometry education through blended learning methods. Optometry practices changed and adapted instantly to the new hygiene norms that have raised the standard of care provided to patients. Telemedicine emerged as a mode of providing care by optometrists. Overall, all key stakeholders of optometry in India were found to have adapted well to the sudden changes due to COVID 19 pandemic.","Sehgal, Shivalika; Shinde, Lakshmi; Madheswaran, Gopinath; Mukherjee, Paula; Verkicharla, Pavan; Easwaran, Soumya; Bandamwar, Kalika",Indian J Ophthalmol,227,16

In clinical practice, we noticed that many severe or critically ill COVID-19 patients developed typical clinical manifestations of shock, including cold extremities and weak peripheral pulses, even in the absence of overt hypotension. Understanding the mechanism of viral sepsis in COVID-19 is warranted for exploring better clinical care for these patients. With evidence collected from autopsy studies on COVID-19 and basic science research on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and SARS-CoV, we have put forward several hypotheses about SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis after multiple rounds of discussion among basic science researchers, pathologists, and clinicians working on COVID-19. We hypothesise that a process called viral sepsis is crucial to the disease mechanism of COVID-19. Although these ideas might be proven imperfect or even wrong later, we believe they can provide inputs and guide directions for basic research at this moment.","Li, Hui; Liu, Liang; Zhang, Dingyu; Xu, Jiuyang; Dai, Huaping; Tang, Nan; Su, Xiao; Cao, Bin",Lancet,227,20

The current crisis has led to an urgent requirement to develop therapeutics. Even though a number of vaccines are available, alternative strategies targeting essential viral components are required as a backup against the emergence of lethal viral variants. One such target is the main protease (M(pro)) that plays an indispensable role in viral replication. The availability of over 270 M(pro) X-ray structures in complex with inhibitors provides unique insights into ligand–protein interactions. Herein, we provide a comprehensive comparison of all nonredundant ligand-binding sites available for SARS-CoV2, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV M(pro). Extensive adaptive sampling has been used to investigate structural conservation of ligand-binding sites using Markov state models (MSMs) and compare conformational dynamics employing convolutional variational auto-encoder-based deep learning. Our results indicate that not all ligand-binding sites are dynamically conserved despite high sequence and structural conservation across β-CoV homologs.

METHOD: A focused literature review was undertaken, partly informed by a forthcoming report on environment, agriculture and infectious diseases of poverty, facilitated by the Special Programme for Tropical Diseases. RESULTS: More than ten categories of infectious disease emergence exist, but none formally analyse past, current or future burden of disease. Other evidence suggests that the dominant public health concern focuses on two informal groupings. Most important is the perceived threat of newly recognised infections, especially viruses that arise or are newly discovered in developing countries that originate in species exotic to developed countries, such as non-human primates, bats and rodents. These pathogens may be transmitted by insects or bats, or via direct human contact with bushmeat. The second group is new strains of influenza arising from intensively farmed chickens or pigs, or emerging from Asian “wet markets” where several bird species have close contact. Both forms appear justified because of two great pandemics: HIV/AIDS (which appears to have originated from bushmeat hunting in Africa before emerging globally) and Spanish influenza, which killed up to 2.5% of the human population around the end of World War I. Insufficiently appreciated is the contribution of the milieu which appeared to facilitate the high disease burden in these pandemics. Additionally, excess anxiety over emerging infectious diseases diverts attention from issues of greater public health importance, especially: (i) existing (including neglected) infectious diseases and (ii) the changing milieu that is eroding the determinants of immunity and public health, caused by adverse global environmental changes, including climate change and other components of stressed life and civilisation-supporting systems. CONCLUSIONS: The focus on novel pathogens and minor forms of anti-microbial resistance in emerging disease literature is unjustified by their burden of disease, actual and potential, and diverts attention from far more important health problems and determinants. There is insufficient understanding of systemic factors that promote pandemics. Adverse global change could generate circumstances conducive to future pandemics with a high burden of disease, arising via anti-microbial and insecticidal resistance, under-nutrition, conflict, and public health breakdown.","Butler, Colin D",Infect Dis Poverty,227,20

Undoubtedly, the COVID-19 has brought changes that may impact the plan of career progression for both students and faculty. Hitherto, medical education had students getting into contact with patients and faculty in a facility setting. Their physical presence in both in-and outpatients' settings has been a tradition of early clinical immersion experiences and the clerkship curriculum. Rotating between departments makes the students potential vectors and victims for COVID-19. COVID-19 has the potential to affect students throughout the educational process. The pandemic has led to a complete paradigm shift in the mode of instruction in a clinical care setting. Inperson training has either been reduced or cancelled in favour of virtual forms of pedagogy. The clinics have also seen a reduction in a variety of surgical and medical cases. This situation may result in potential gaps in their training. Outpatient clinics have transitioned mainly to telemedicine, thus minimizing students' exposure to clinic encounters.

METHODS: The hospital staffs recovered from COVID-19 were included. The candidates who had an ear disease or progressive hearing loss prior to COVID-19, or having been hospitalised because of severe and critical COVID-19 were excluded. The age, sex, symptoms during COVID-19, and medications received for the disease were noted. The hearing thresholds (HT) of the participants who had an audiogram before having COVID-19 disease were recorded. A pure tone audiometry was conducted to all. The participants were classified into two groups; Group 1: participants who had an audiogram previously, Group 2: participants who didn’t have an audiogram previously. The changes of the HTs of the participants in Group 1 were analyzed. The HTs of the participants in Group 2 were documented without any comparison.

COVID-19 was mild or asymptomatic in those experiencing infection. Methods : NtAb was tested before BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (V0), 20±2 days after the first dose (V1_20), 20±3 days (V2_20) and 90±2 days (V2_90) after the second dose in vaccinated HCW and after about 2 months (N_60), 10 months (N_300) and 13 months (N_390) from natural infection in unvaccinated HCW. NtAb was measured by authentic virus neutralization with a SARS-CoV-2 B.1 isolate circulating in Italy at HCW enrolment. Results : Sixty-two HCW were enrolled. NtAb were comparable in infected HCW with no or mild disease at all the study points. NtAb of uninfected HCW were significantly lower with respect to those of previously infected subjects at V1_20, V2_20 and V2_90. The median NtAb fold decrease from V2_20 to V2_90 was higher in the uninfected subjects with respect to subjects with mild infection (6.26 vs 2.58, p=0.03) and to asymptomatic HCW (6.26 vs 3.67, p=0.022). The median Nabt at N_390 was significantly lower with respect to N_60, p=0.007). Conclusions : In uninfected subjects completing the two-dose vaccine schedule, a third mRNA vaccine dose is a reasonable option to counteract the substantial NtAb decline occurring at a significantly higher rate compared to previously infected, vaccinated subjects.

There were significant differences in the distribution of DC-SIGN and DC-SIGNR alleles among African and non-African populations. Finally, our study clearly demonstrates that Africans show greater genetic diversity at these two closely-related immune loci than observed in other major population groups. The differences may reflect evolutionary pressures generated by environmental factors, such as prevalent pathogens in these geographically distinct regions.

The COVID-19 pandemic required researchers to consider if remote data collection can meet research objectives, while retaining the same level of data quality and participant protections. We use four case studies from the Philippines, Zambia, India and Uganda to assess the challenges and opportunities of remote data collection during COVID-19. We present lessons learned that may inform practice in similar settings, as well as reflections for the field of qualitative inquiry in the post-COVID-19 era. Key challenges and strategies to overcome them included the need for adapted researcher training in the use of technologies and consent procedures, preparation for abbreviated interviews due to connectivity concerns, and the adoption of regular researcher debriefings. Participant outreach to allay suspicions ranged from communicating study information through multiple channels to highlighting associations with local institutions to boost credibility. Interviews were largely successful, and contained a meaningful level of depth, nuance and conviction that allowed teams to meet study objectives. Rapport still benefitted from conventional interviewer skills, including attentiveness and fluency with interview guides. While differently abled populations may encounter different barriers, the included case studies, which varied in geography and aims, all experienced more rapid recruitment and robust enrollment. Reduced in-person travel lowered interview costs and increased participation among groups who may not have otherwise attended. In our view, remote data collection is not a replacement for in-person endeavours, but a highly beneficial complement. It may increase accessibility and equity in participant contributions and lower costs, while maintaining rich data collection in multiple study target populations and settings.","Reñosa, Mark Donald C; Mwamba, Chanda; Meghani, Ankita; West, Nora S; Hariyani, Shreya; Ddaaki, William; Sharma, Anjali; Beres, Laura K; McMahon, Shannon",BMJ Glob Health,227,24

Although current data is lacking, some research suggests that principals have a stressful work situation that eventually may lead to burnout and exhaustion disorder, thus negatively affecting the ability of principals to function as leaders. To gauge the situation in Sweden, and as a basis for future preventive actions, we examined to what extent principals displayed signs of exhaustion and whether the prevalence rates of exhaustion differed across school levels, length of work experience as a principal, and gender. METHODS: Principals (N = 2219; mean age 49 years [SD 7 years]; 78% women) working at least 50% in pre-schools, compulsory schools, upper secondary schools or adult education completed a cross-sectional web survey entailing two validated inventories: The Karolinska Exhaustion Disorder Scale (KEDS) and the Lund University Checklist for Incipient Exhaustion (LUCIE). Data was analysed using traditional non-parametric methods. Gender stratification achieved covariate balance when analysing school level and length of work experience. RESULTS: Altogether, 29.0% of the principals met the exhaustion criteria in KEDS. The prevalence rates for the four LUCIE-steps of increasing signs of exhaustion were: no signs of stress, 48.8%; weak signs of stress, 25.6%; clear signs of stress but no exhaustion, 15.4%; possible exhaustion disorder, 10.2%. Compared with male principals, female principals reported more signs of possible exhaustion disorder in both LUCIE and KEDS. School level was not associated with reports of exhaustion symptoms in neither LUCIE nor KEDS. Among male principals, length of work experience was associated with exhaustion symptoms in KEDS. CONCLUSIONS: A large group of Swedish principals working in pre-schools, compulsory schools, upper secondary schools or adult education displayed a symptomatology of signs of exhaustion that if sustained might lead to poor health. This observation suggests that education authorities, or other relevant stakeholders, ought to take some form of preventive action. However, effective combinations of individual, group, organisational, and/or societal preventive activities remain to be identified and tested.","Persson, Roger; Leo, Ulf; Arvidsson, Inger; Håkansson, Carita; Nilsson, Kerstin; Österberg, Kai",BMC Public Health,227,1

OBJECTIVE: To assess hospital discharge rates, demographic factors, and outcomes of hospitalization associated with the COVID-19 pandemic among US patients with IS before vs during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This retrospective cohort study used data from the Vizient Clinical Data Base on 324 013 patients with IS at 478 nonfederal hospitals in 43 US states between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. Patients were eligible if they were admitted to the hospital on a nonelective basis and were not receiving hospice care at the time of admission. A total of 41 166 discharged between January and March 2020 were excluded from the analysis because they had unreliable data on COVID-19 status, leaving 282 847 patients for the study. EXPOSURE: Ischemic stroke and laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Monthly counts of discharges among patients with IS in 2020. Demographic characteristics and outcomes, including in-hospital death, among patients with IS who were discharged in 2019 (control group) were compared with those of patients with IS with or without comorbid COVID-19 (COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 groups, respectively) who were discharged between April and December 2020. RESULTS: Of the 282 847 patients included in the study, 165 912 (50.7% male; 63.4% White; 26.3% aged ≥80 years) were allocated to the control group; 111 418 of 116 935 patients (95.3%; 51.9% male; 62.8% White; 24.6% aged ≥80 years) were allocated to the non–COVID-19 group and 5517 of 116 935 patients (4.7%; 58.0% male; 42.5% White; 21.3% aged ≥80 years) to the COVID-19 group. A mean (SD) of 13 846 (553) discharges per month among patients with IS was reported in 2019. Discharges began decreasing in February 2020, reaching a low of 10 846 patients in April 2020 before returning to a prepandemic level of 13 639 patients by July 2020. A mean (SD) of 13 492 (554) discharges per month was recorded for the remainder of 2020. Black and Hispanic patients accounted for 21.4% and 7.0% of IS discharges in 2019, respectively, but accounted for 27.5% and 16.0% of those discharged with IS and comorbid COVID-19 in 2020. Compared with patients in the control and non–COVID-19 groups, those in the COVID-19 group were less likely to smoke (16.0% vs 17.2% vs 6.4%, respectively) and to have hypertension (73.0% vs 73.1% vs 68.2%) or dyslipidemia (61.2% vs 63.2% vs 56.6%) but were more likely to have diabetes (39.8% vs 40.5% vs 53.0%), obesity (16.2% vs 18.4% vs 24.5%), acute coronary syndrome (8.0% vs 9.2% vs 15.8%), or pulmonary embolus (1.9% vs 2.4% vs 6.8%) and to require intubation (11.3% vs 12.3% vs 37.6%). After adjusting for baseline factors, patients with IS and COVID-19 were more likely to die in the hospital than were patients with IS in 2019 (adjusted odds ratio, 5.17; 95% CI, 4.83-5.53; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale adjusted odds ratio, 3.57; 95% CI, 3.15-4.05). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, after the emergence of COVID-19, hospital discharges of patients with IS decreased in the US but returned to prepandemic levels by July 2020. Among patients with IS between April and December 2020, comorbid COVID-19 was relatively common, particularly among Black and Hispanic populations, and morbidity was high.","de Havenon, Adam; Ney, John P.; Callaghan, Brian; Hohmann, Samuel; Shippey, Ernie; Yaghi, Shadi; Anadani, Mohammad; Majersik, Jennifer J.",JAMA Netw Open,227,26

Simulation studies were carried out to understand the outcomes under the scenarios if early-implementation and removal of stay-at-home order occurred. SETTING: Population data in the United States PARTICIPANTS: Residents in the U.S., who were affected by the stay-at-home and face-masking policies MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Turning-points of the daily new cases and deaths of COVID-19, and COVID-19 time-varying reproduction numbers (Rt) in the U.S. RESULTS: The number and the proportion of U.S. residents under SAHO increased between March 19 and April 7, and plateaued at 29,0829,980 and 88.6%, respectively. The trend in COVID-19 daily cases reduced after March 23 (P<0.001) and further reduced on April 3 (P<0.001), which was associated with implementation of SAHO by 10 states on March 23, and the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions recommendation of face-masking, respectively. Similar turning points were identified in the trends of daily deaths with a lag time. The estimates of Rt based on the 3 reported mean serial-intervals of COVID-19 all started to decline on March 19, when SAHO was first implemented in the U.S. and declined faster after March 23. After a short plateau, Rt continued to decline after April 3 and fell below/around 1.0 on April 13. CONCLUSIONS: There were 2 turning points of COVID-19 daily new cases or deaths in the U.S., which appeared to associate with implementation of SAHO and the CDC face-masking recommendation. Simulation on early-implementation and removal of SAHO reveals considerable impact on COVID-19 daily new cases and deaths. These findings may inform decision-making of lifting SAHO and face.","Xu, J.; Hussain, S.; Lu, G.; Wei, S.; Bao, W.; Zhang, L.",medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,227,16

The aim of the study is to understand how people living in 15 countries around the globe experience an unexpected crisis which threatens their health and that of loved ones, and how they make meaning of this disruption in their narratives. METHODS: Data were collected through an anonymous online survey during May–September 2020, which was during or just after the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, depending on the country. The questionnaire included demographic and three open-ended questions as prompts for stories about experiences during the initial months of the pandemic. The text was analyzed through inductive thematic content analysis and quantified for full sample description, demographic and subsequently international comparisons. RESULTS: The final qualitative dataset included stories from n = 1685 respondents. The sample was 73.6% women and 26.4% men. The mean age of participants was 39.55 years (SD = 14.71). The identified four groups of overarching themes were: The presence and absence of others; Rediscovering oneself; The meaning of daily life; Rethinking societal and environmental values. We discuss the prevalence of each theme for the sample as a whole and differences by demographic groups. The most prevalent theme referred to disruptions in interpersonal contacts, made meaningful by the increased appreciation of the value of relationships, present in (45.6%) of stories. It was more prevalent in the stories of women compared to men (χ² = 24.88, p = .001). CONCLUSIONS: The paper provides a detailed overview of the methodology, the main themes identified inductively in the stories and differences according to select demographic variables. We identify several major ways of making meaning of the pandemic. The pandemic has impacted many aspects of people’s lives which give it meaning, no matter where they live.","Todorova, Irina; Albers, Liesemarie; Aronson, Nicole; Baban, Adriana; Benyamini, Yael; Cipolletta, Sabrina; del Rio Carral, Maria; Dimitrova, Elitsa; Dudley, Claire; Guzzardo, Mariana; Hammoud, Razan; Fadil Azim, Darlina Hani; Hilverda, Femke; Huang, Qi; John, Liji; Kaneva, Michaela; Khan, Sanjida; Kostova, Zlatina; Kotzeva, Tatyana; Fathima, M.A.; Anto, Milu Maria; Michoud, Chloé; Awal Miah, Mohammad Abdul; Mohr, Julia; Morgan, Karen; Nastase, Elena Simona; Neter, Efrat; Panayotova, Yulia; Patel, Hemali; Pillai, Dhanya; Polidoro Lima, Manuela; Qin, Desiree Baolian; Salewski, Christel; Sankar, K.

Despite the consensus about the SARS-CoV-2 origin from bat CoV RaTG13, discrepancy to host tropism to other human Coronaviruses exist. SARS-CoV-2 also possesses some differences in its S protein receptor-binding domain, glycan-binding N-terminal domain and the surface of the sialic acid-binding domain. Despite similarities based on cryo-EM and biochemical studies, the SARS-CoV-2 shows higher stability and binding affinity to the ACE2 receptor. The SARS-CoV-2 does not appear to present a mutational “hot spot” as only the D614G mutation has been identified from clinical isolates. As laboratory manipulation is highly unlikely for the origin of SARS-CoV-2, the current possibilities comprise either natural selection in animal host before zoonotic transfer or natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer. In the former case, despite SARS-CoV-2 and bat RaTG13 showing 96% identity some pangolin Coronaviruses exhibit very high similarity to particularly the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. In the latter case, it can be hypothesized that the SARS-CoV-2 genome has adapted during human-to-human transmission and based on available data, the isolated SARS-CoV-2 genomes derive from a common origin.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether this risk is, at least in part, modulated by an increase of thromboembolic complications. METHODS: We prospectively followed 180 hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia admitted to the Internal Medicine Units of San Raffaele Hospital. Data from 11 out of 180 patients were considered incomplete and excluded from the analysis. We analysed inflammation, tissue damage biomarkers, hemostatic parameters, thrombotic events (TEs) and clinical outcome according to the presence of diabetes/stress hyperglycemia. RESULTS: Among 169 patients, 51 (30.2%) had diabetes/stress hyperglycemia. Diabetes/stress hyperglycemia and fasting blood glucose (FBG) were associated with increased inflammation and tissue damage circulating markers, higher D-dimer levels, increased prothrombin time and lower antithrombin III activity. Forty-eight venous and 10 arterial TEs were identified in 49 (29%) patients. Diabetes/stress hyperglycemia (HR 2.71, p = 0.001), fasting blood glucose (HR 4.32, p < 0.001) and glucose variability (HR 1.6, p < 0.009) were all associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic complication. TEs significantly increased the risk for an adverse clinical outcome only in the presence of diabetes/stress hyperglycemia (HR 3.05, p = 0.010) or fasting blood glucose ≥7 mmol/L (HR 3.07, p = 0.015). CONCLUSIONS: Thromboembolism risk is higher among patients with diabetes/stress hyperglycemia and COVID-19 pneumonia and is associated to poor clinical outcome. In case of SARS-Cov-2 infection patients with diabetes/stress hyperglycemia could be considered for a more intensive prophylactic anticoagulation regimen.","Calvisi, Stefania L.; Ramirez, Giuseppe A.; Scavini, Marina; Da Prat, Valentina; Di Lucca, Giuseppe; Laurenzi, Andrea; Gallina, Gabriele; Cavallo, Ludovica; Borio, Giorgia; Farolfi, Federica; Pascali, Maria; Castellani, Jacopo; Lampasona, Vito; D'Angelo, Armando; Landoni, Giovanni; Ciceri, Fabio; Querini, Patrizia Rovere; Tresoldi, Moreno; Piemonti, Lorenzo",Metabolism,227,20

Public health authorities are developing vaccination programmes with priorities that minimize the risk of mortality and severe events in individuals and communities. We propose an evidence-based strategy that targets the frailest subjects whose timely vaccination is likely to minimize future deaths and preserve the resilience of the health service by preventing infections. METHODS: The cohort includes 146,087 cases with COVID-19 diagnosed in 2020 in Milan (3.49 million inhabitants). Individual level data on 42 chronic diseases and vital status updated as of January 21, 2021, were available in administrative data. Analyses were performed in three sub-cohorts of age (16–64, 65–79 and 80+ years) and comorbidities affecting mortality were selected by means of LASSO cross-validated conditional logistic regression. Simplified models based on previous results identified high-risk categories worth targeting with highest priority. Results adjusted by age and gender, were reported in terms of odds ratios and 95%CI. RESULTS: The final models include as predictors of mortality (7,667 deaths, 5.2%) 10, 12, and 5 chronic diseases, respectively. The older age categories shared, as risk factors, chronic renal failure, chronic heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, Parkinson disease and psychiatric diseases. In the younger age category, predictors included neoplasm, organ transplantation and psychiatric conditions. Results were consistent with those obtained on mortality at 60 days from diagnosis (6,968 deaths). CONCLUSION: This approach defines a two-level stratification for priorities in the vaccination that can easily be applied by health authorities, eventually adapted to local results in terms of number and types of comorbidities, and rapidly updated with current data. After the early phase of vaccination, data on effectiveness and safety will give the opportunity to revise prioritization and discuss the future approach in the remaining population.","Russo, Antonio Giampiero; Decarli, Adriano; Valsecchi, Maria Grazia",Vaccine,227,1

Features of infection in immunosuppressed adults are poorly characterised. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to determine the epidemiology of HRV-C in haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients in a single centre. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of all HSCT recipients admitted to Westmead Hospital, Westmead, Australia from 1 July 2005 to 30 September 2007 was undertaken. Nose/throat samples were collected from all patients at the time of admission and patients developing pre-defined symptoms and/or signs of respiratory infection during the admission. Samples were processed and tested for rhinoviruses and 14 other respiratory viruses using nucleic acid-based methods, immunofluorescence and culture. HRV genotyping was performed by sequencing a region of the rhinovirus 5′ untranslated region (UTR). Clinical data on each episode were collected prospectively. RESULTS: HRVs were identified in 24 episodes: 8% of 299 episodes of clinically- defined respiratory infections and 39% of 61 episodes in which respiratory viruses were detected. HRV-C was most frequent (HRV-C: nine, HRV-A: eight and HRV-B: two). Seven episodes of HRV-C, five with pneumonia, occurred within 100 days of HSCT. Co-pathogens were frequent. CONCLUSIONS: The newly described HRV-C was the most common rhinovirus group detected in HSCT recipients with respiratory infection, with co-pathogens being frequent. Further research is required to understand the activity and pathogenicity of this virus in HSCT recipients.","Ferguson, Patricia E.; Gilroy, Nicole M.; Faux, Cassandra E.; Mackay, Ian M.; Sloots, Theo P.; Nissen, Michael D.; Dwyer, Dominic E.; Sorrell, Tania C.",J Clin Virol,227,11

We aimed to investigate the association between history of anemia and 12-year mortality rate due to infections, and compare it with that among non-anemic individuals. METHODS: Data from the National Health Insurance Service Health Screening Cohort were used in this population-based cohort study. Adults who underwent standardized medical examination between and 2002–2003 were included, and the mortality rate due to infection between 2004 and 2015 was analyzed. Individuals were considered to have a history of anemia if the serum hemoglobin level in 2002–2003 was < 12 g/dL for women and < 13 g/dL for men. The severity of anemia at that time was categorized as mild (12 g/dL > hemoglobin ≥11 g/dL in women and 13 g/dL > hemoglobin ≥11 g/dL in men), moderate (hemoglobin 8–10.9 g/dL), or severe (hemoglobin < 8 g/dL). Propensity score (PS) matching and Cox regression analysis were used as statistical methods. RESULTS: Overall, 512,905 individuals were included in this study. The mean age of the participants was 54.5 years old (range: 40–98), and 49,042 (9.6%) individuals were classified in the anemic group, which comprised of 36,383 (7.1%), 11,787 (2.3%), and 872 (0.2%) participants in the mild, moderate, and severe sub-groups, respectively. After PS matching, 49,039 individuals in each group were included in the analysis. The risk of mortality due to infection in the anemic group was 1.77-fold higher (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.77, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.52–2.60; P < 0.001) than that in the non-anemic group. In the subgroup analysis, the mild and moderate anemia groups had 1.38-fold (HR: 1.38, 95% CI: 1.23 to 1.55; P < 0.001) and 2.02-fold (HR: 2.02, 95% CI: 1.62 to 2.50; P < 0.001) risk of mortality due to infection compared to that of the non-anemic group, respectively. The severe anemia group did not have a significantly different risk of mortality due to infection (P = 0.448).

In Germany, one such challenge has been that adequate palliative care for the severely ill and dying (with and without COVID-19), as well as their loved ones, has not been available at all times and in all settings., the pandemic has underlined the significance of the contribution of general practitioners (GPs) to the care of severely ill and dying patients. OBJECTIVES: To describe GPs’ experiences, challenges and perspectives with respect to end-of-life care during the first peak of the pandemic (spring 2020) in Germany. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In November and December 2020, a link to an Unipark online survey was sent to GPs registered on nationwide distribution lists. RESULTS: In total, 410 GPs responded; 61.5% indicated that the quality of their patients’ end-of-life care was maintained throughout the pandemic, 36.8% reported a decrease in quality compared to pre-pandemic times. Of the GPs who made home visits to severely ill and dying patients, 61.4% reported a stable number of visits, 28.5% reported fewer visits. 62.7% of the GPs reported increased telephone contact and reduced personal contact with patients; 36.1% offered video consultations in lieu of face-to-face contact. The GPs reported that relatives were restricted (48.5%) or prohibited from visiting (33.4%) patients in nursing homes. They observed a fear of loneliness among patients in nursing homes (91.9%), private homes (87.3%) and hospitals (86.1%). CONCLUSIONS: The present work provides insights into the pandemic management of GPs and supports the development of a national strategy for palliative care during a pandemic. To effectively address end-of-life care, GPs and palliative care specialists should be involved in COVID-19 task forces on micro, meso and macro levels of health care.","Tielker, Jannik M.; Weber, Jan P.; Simon, Steffen T.; Bausewein, Claudia; Stiel, Stephanie; Schneider, Nils",PLoS One,227,30

While our communities practice safety protocols, medical personnel working on the COVID-19 response effort are at high risk for exposure and contraction. This creates an urgent need to better understand whether sleep may contribute to COVID-19 symptom onset, severity, and recovery. This study examined the relationship between subjective and objective sleep during infection. METHODS: Fifty volunteers (age 35.15±9.97) considered high risk for COVID-19 participated in the study. The sample consisted mostly of medical personnel (93.27%) working through the pandemic. Over six months, participants completed monthly surveys and daily logs via Qualtrics. These surveys included questions about sleep, infection symptoms, COVID-19 tests and diagnoses, and mood. Wrist-worn actigraphy was collected continuously throughout the study. Sleep duration, latency, wake after sleep onset, and efficiency were processed using Philips Actiware 6.0. Actigraphy and survey data were analyzed using SPSS v. 25. RESULTS: Sixty-two percent of participants experienced infection symptoms. Those experiencing symptoms were significantly more likely to report having poorer sleep quality t(255.59)=5.78, p=<.001, poorer mood upon waking t(258.03)=6.53, p=<.001, feeling less alert upon waking t(255.61)=4.56, p=<.001, and spending more time awake at night t(2.66.98)=-7.29, p=<.001. Results showed that compared to those asymptomatic, participants with cough t(2164)=2.07, p=.039, diarrhea t(2161)=2.51, p=.012, and headache t(106.18)=7.05, p=<.001 all had significantly less total sleep time, while those with body aches spent significantly more time awake at night t(2164)=2.10, p=.036. CONCLUSION: This preliminary examination of the data broadly suggests that medical personnel experiencing infection symptoms may have difficulty obtaining adequate sleep. Further, specific infection symptoms may share a stronger relationship with key sleep parameters than others.

METHODS: All the consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to Fuyang second people’s hospital or the fifth medical center of Chinese PLA general hospital between January 20 and February 22, 2020, were enrolled and their clinical data were retrospectively collected. Multivariate COX regression was used to identify the risk factors associated with progression, and then were incorporated into the nomogram to establish a novel prediction scoring model. ROC was used to assess the performance of the novel model. RESULTS: Overall, 208 patients were divided into stable group (n=168, 80.8%) and progressive group (n=40,19.2%) based on whether their conditions worsened during the hospitalization Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that comorbidity, older age, lower lymphocyte and higher lactate dehydrogenase at presentation were independent high-risk factors for COVID-19 progression. Incorporating these 4 factors, the nomogram achieved good concordance indexes of 0.86 (95%CI 0.81 - 0.91), and had well-fitted calibration curves. A novel scoring model, named as CALL, was established, and its area under ROC was 0.91 (95% CI 0.86 to 0.94). Using a cutoff value of 6 points, the positive and negative predictive values were 50.7% (38.9% - 62.4%) and 98.5% (94.7% - 99.8%), respectively. CONCLUSION: Using the CALL score model, clinicians can improve the therapeutic effect and reduce the mortality of COVID-19 with more accurate and reasonable resolutions on medical resources.","Ji, Dong; Zhang, Dawei; Xu, Jing; Chen, Zhu; Yang, Tieniu; Zhao, Peng; Chen, Guofeng; Cheng, Gregory; Wang, Yudong; Bi, Jingfeng; Tan, Lin; Lau, George; Qin, Enqiang",Clin Infect Dis,227,14

To allow every laboratory or hospital access to an in-house assay, we developed a low-cost SARS-CoV-2 detection assay protocol using in-house primers and reagents/equipment on hand in most biology or diagnostic laboratories: a SYBR Green–based RT-PCR. RNA extraction has also become a major bottleneck due to limited supplies and the required labor. Thus, we validated an alternative RNA extraction protocol. METHODS: We designed and synthesized in-house primers according to SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences retrieved from GISAID database. One hundred and ninety patient samples were collected by nasopharyngeal swab, coded, and used to develop and validate the assay protocol. RNA extraction was performed using TRI reagent-based RNA protocol to inactivate the virus; thus, testing was conducted in a conventional biosafety level 2 laboratory. RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity of the primers were evaluated using 190 patient samples previously tested for SARS-CoV-2. The positive amplicons were sequenced to confirm the results. The assay protocol was developed, and the specificity of each RT-PCR product was confirmed using melting curve analyses. Of 190 samples, the SYBR Green–based RT-PCR assay detected SARS-CoV-2 target genes in 88 samples, with no false-positive results. These findings indicate that the sensitivity of our assay was 97.7% and specificity of 100% with those of the diagnostic laboratory that tested the same samples using a Rotor-Gene PCR cycler with an Altona Diagnostics SARS-CoV-2 kit (R(2) = 0.89). CONCLUSIONS: These approaches are reliable, repeatable, specific, sensitive, simple, and low-cost tools for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in a conventional biosafety level 2 laboratory, offering alternative approaches when commercial kits are unavailable or not affordable.","Alhamlan, Fatimah S.; Alqahtani, Ahmed A.; Bakheet, Dana M.; Bohol, Marie F.; Althawadi, Sahar I.; Mutabagani, Maysoon S.; Almaghrabi, Reem S.; Obeid, Dalia A.",J Infect Public Health,227,20

Despite common COVID-19 symptoms, variability in clinical phenotypes was reported worldwide. Reports on SARS-CoV-2 suggest causing neurological manifestation. In addition, the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 in patients with neurodegenerative diseases and its complexity are largely unclear. Here, we aimed to demonstrate the possible transport of exosome from SARS-CoV-2–infected lungs to the brain regions associated with neurodegenerative diseases using multiple transcriptome datasets of SARS-CoV-2–infected lungs, RNA profiles from lung exosome, and gene expression profiles of the human brain. Upon transport, the transcription factors localized in the exosome regulate genes at lateral substantia nigra, medial substantia nigra, and superior frontal gyrus regions of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and frontal cortex, hippocampus, and temporal cortex of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). On SARS-CoV-2 infection, BCL3, JUND, MXD1, IRF2, IRF9, and STAT1 transcription factors in the exosomes influence the neuronal gene regulatory network and accelerate neurodegeneration. STAT1 transcription factor regulates 64 PD genes at lateral substantia nigra, 65 at superior frontal gyrus, and 19 at medial substantia nigra. Similarly, in AD, STAT1 regulates 74 AD genes at the temporal cortex, 40 genes at the hippocampus, and 16 genes at the frontal cortex. We further demonstrate that dysregulated neuronal genes showed involvement in immune response, signal transduction, apoptosis, and stress response process. In conclusion, SARS-CoV-2 may dysregulate neuronal gene regulatory network through exosomes that attenuate disease severity of neurodegeneration.

Group testing could be a promising candidate for screening to save time and resources. However, due to the high false-negative rate (FNR) of the RT-PCR diagnostic test, we should be cautious about using group testing because a group's false-negative result identifies all the individuals in a group as uninfected. Repeating the test is the best solution to reduce the FNR, and repeats should be integrated with the group-testing method to increase the sensitivity of the test. The simplest way is to replicate the test twice for each group (the 2Rgt method). In this paper, we present a new method for group testing (the groupMix method), which integrates two repeats in the test. Then we introduce the adaptive version of both the groupMix and the 2Rgt methods. We compare these methods analytically regarding the sensitivity and the average number of tests. The tradeoff between the sensitivity and the average number of tests should be considered when choosing the best method for the screening strategy. We applied the non-adaptive groupMix method to screening 263 people and identified 2 infected individuals by performing 98 tests. This method achieved a 63% saving in the number of tests compared to individual testing. This method is currently applied to COVID-19 screening in the Clinical Genetic Laboratory at the Royan Institute, Tehran, Iran. Our experimental results show that in COVID-19 screening, the viral load can be low, and the group size should not be more than 6; otherwise, the FNR increases significantly. A web interface of the non-adaptive groupMix method is publicly available for laboratories to implement this method.","Alizad-Rahvar, A. R.; Vafadar, S.; Totonchi, M.; Sadeghi, M.",,227,1

Unrepaired DNA damage is known to precipitate cellular senescence, which was hypothesized to be the underlying cause of certain age‐related phenotypes. Consistent with this, some hallmarks of immune aging were more prevalent in individuals exposed to whole‐body irradiation (WBI), which leaves no anatomical repository of undamaged hematopoietic cells. To decisively test whether and to what extent WBI in youth will leave a mark on the immune system as it ages, we exposed young male C57BL/6 mice to sublethal WBI (0.5–4 Gy), mimicking human survivor exposure during nuclear catastrophe. We followed lymphocyte homeostasis thorough the lifespan, response to vaccination, and ability to resist lethal viral challenge in the old age. None of the irradiated groups showed significant differences compared with mock‐irradiated (0 Gy) animals for the parameters measured. Even the mice that received the highest dose of sublethal WBI in youth (4 Gy) exhibited equilibrated lymphocyte homeostasis, robust T‐ and B‐cell responses to live attenuated West Nile virus (WNV) vaccine and full survival following vaccination upon lethal WNV challenge. Therefore, a single dose of nonlethal WBI in youth, resulting in widespread DNA damage and repopulation stress in hematopoietic cells, leaves no significant trace of increased immune aging in a lethal vaccine challenge model.","Pugh, Jason L.; Foster, Sarah A.; Sukhina, Alona S.; Petravic, Janka; Uhrlaub, Jennifer L.; Padilla‐Torres, Jose; Hayashi, Tomonori; Nakachi, Kei; Smithey, Megan J.; Nikolich‐Žugich, Janko",Aging Cell,227,16

ACE2 and a network of further enzymes and receptors constitute the non‐classical renin‐angiotensin system. ACE2 cleaves angiotensin II, which promotes vasoconstriction, oxidative stress, liver and lung inflammation and fibrosis, into angiotensin 1‐7 (Ang1‐7), which binds to Mas receptors (MasR), resulting in arterial vasodilatation, natriuresis, anti‐inflammatory and anti‐fibrotic effects in tissues. Viral binding to ACE2 allows viral entry into human cells including hepatocytes, followed by viral replication and host cell depletion of ACE2. The coronavirus‐dependent demise of ACE2 and its product (Ang1‐7) leads to cytokine activation and cytokine‐induced hepatocyte apoptosis and necrosis, which in turn decreases liver reserve and may induce hepatic injury. Approximately one third of patients with cirrhosis, especially those with decompensation, die after a median of 10 days from COVID‐19 diagnosis, and nearly two‐thirds of these deaths occur before intensive care unit admission for COVID‐19‐related pulmonary insufficiency. In these cases, liver function deteriorates rapidly after hospital admission, suggesting that cirrhotic patients frequently die from accelerated end‐stage liver disease. Pharmaceutical interventions which may provide novel strategies to counter liver cirrhosis decompensation due to COVID‐19 include non‐peptidic MasR agonist AVE0991, which replaces the anti‐inflammatory and anti‐fibrotic effects of Ang1‐7, and metallopeptidase neprilysin inhibitor candoxatrilat, which reduces Ang1‐7 clearance and causes portal pressure reduction with increased natriuresis in experimental cirrhosis. Moreover, SF2809E, an inhibitor of serine protease chymase (an enzyme generating most tissue angiotensin II) may also block TMPRRS2, a host serine protease that primes SARS‐CoV‐2 spike glycoprotein before adhesion to ACE2. These and further drugs deserve consideration in patients with COVID‐19 and hepatic comorbidities.","Sansoè, Giovanni; Aragno, Manuela; Wong, Florence",Hepatology,227,16

The impact of shelter-in-place orders on older adults’ health and well-being is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between life-space mobility and quality of life (QoL) in older adults with and without frailty during the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN: Multicenter prospective cohort study based on structured telephone interviews. SETTING: Four geriatric outpatient clinics in the metropolitan area of Sao Paulo, Brazil. PARTICIPANTS: 557 community-dwelling adults aged 60 years and older. MEASUREMENTS: The Life-Space Assessment was used to measure community mobility before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a previously validated decrease of ≥ 5 points defined restricted life-space mobility. Frailty was assessed through the FRAIL (fatigue, resistance, ambulation, illnesses, and loss of weight) scale. The impact of shelter-in-place orders on QoL was evaluated with the question «How is the COVID-19 pandemic affecting your QoL?», to which participants could respond «not at all», «to some extent», or «to a great extent». We used ordinal logistic regressions to investigate the relationship between restricted life-space mobility and impact on QoL, adjusting our analyses for demographics, frailty, comorbidities, cognition, functionality, loneliness, depression, and anxiety. We explored whether frailty modified the association between life-space mobility and impact on QoL. RESULTS: Participants were on average 80±8 years old, 65% were women, and 33% were frail. The COVID-19 quarantine led to a restriction of community mobility in 79% of participants and affected the QoL for 77% of participants. We found that restricted life-space mobility was associated with impact on QoL in older adults during the pandemic, although frailty modified the magnitude of the association (P-value for interaction=0.03). Frail participants who experienced restricted life-space mobility had twice the odds of reporting an impact on QoL when compared with non-frail individuals, with respective adjusted odds ratios of 4.20 (95% CI=2.36–7.50) and 2.18 (95% CI=1.33–3.58). CONCLUSION: Older adults experienced substantial decreases in life-space mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this unexpected change impacted their QoL.

A prospective study was carried out in patients hospitalized for COVID-19, in which RNA was analyzed in plasma and the buffy coat. Morphological and immunohistochemical studies were used to detect the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the buffy coat. In COVID-19 patients, the obtained RNA concentration in plasma was 448.3 ± 31.30 ng/mL. Of all the patients with positive plasma tests for SARS-CoV-2, 46.15% died from COVID-19. In four cases, tests revealed that SARS-CoV-2 was present in the buffy coat. Abnormal morphology of monocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils was found. An immunohistochemical study showed positivity in mononuclear cells and platelets.

The model estimated that if the government had taken prevention and control measures 1 day later, the cumulative number of laboratory-confirmed patients in the whole country would have increased by 32.1%. If the lockdown of Hubei was imposed 1 day in advance, the cumulative number of laboratory-confirmed patients in other provinces would have decreased by 7.7%.

One obstacle to controlling these epidemics is our poor understanding of the host range of filoviruses and their natural reservoirs. Here, we investigated the role of the intracellular filovirus receptor, Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) as a molecular determinant of Ebola virus (EBOV) host range at the cellular level. Whereas human cells can be infected by EBOV, a cell line derived from a Russell’s viper (Daboia russellii) (VH-2) is resistant to infection in an NPC1-dependent manner. We found that VH-2 cells are resistant to EBOV infection because the Russell’s viper NPC1 ortholog bound poorly to the EBOV spike glycoprotein (GP). Analysis of panels of viper-human NPC1 chimeras and point mutants allowed us to identify a single amino acid residue in NPC1, at position 503, that bidirectionally influenced both its binding to EBOV GP and its viral receptor activity in cells. Significantly, this single residue change perturbed neither NPC1’s endosomal localization nor its housekeeping role in cellular cholesterol trafficking. Together with other recent work, these findings identify sequences in NPC1 that are important for viral receptor activity by virtue of their direct interaction with EBOV GP and suggest that they may influence filovirus host range in nature. Broader surveys of NPC1 orthologs from vertebrates may delineate additional sequence polymorphisms in this gene that control susceptibility to filovirus infection. IMPORTANCE Identifying cellular factors that determine susceptibility to infection can help us understand how Ebola virus is transmitted. We asked if the EBOV receptor Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1) could explain why reptiles are resistant to EBOV infection. We demonstrate that cells derived from the Russell’s viper are not susceptible to infection because EBOV cannot bind to viper NPC1. This resistance to infection can be mapped to a single amino acid residue in viper NPC1 that renders it unable to bind to EBOV GP. The newly solved structure of EBOV GP bound to NPC1 confirms our findings, revealing that this residue dips into the GP receptor-binding pocket and is therefore critical to the binding interface. Consequently, this otherwise well-conserved residue in vertebrate species influences the ability of reptilian NPC1 proteins to bind to EBOV GP, thereby affecting viral host range in reptilian cells.","Ndungo, Esther; Herbert, Andrew S.; Raaben, Matthijs; Obernosterer, Gregor; Biswas, Rohan; Miller, Emily Happy; Wirchnianski, Ariel S.; Carette, Jan E.; Brummelkamp, Thijn R.; Whelan, Sean P.; Dye, John M.; Chandran, Kartik",mSphere,227,20

METHODS: PubMed, PsychInfo, Embase, and CINAHL databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Searches were restricted by date (2000 until present). All empirical quantitative and qualitative studies in which relaxation techniques of various types implemented on health care providers caring for patients during severe coronavirus pandemics and articles that consider the implementation of mental health care services considered to be pertinent, such as commentaries, were included. RESULTS: Fourteen studies met the selection criteria, most of which were recommendations. Only one study described a digital intervention, and user satisfaction was measured. In the recommendations, both organizational and individual self-care interventions were suggested. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is necessary to establish tailor-made effective stress reduction interventions for this population, during these challenging and particular times.","Callus, Edward; Bassola, Barbara; Fiolo, Valentina; Bertoldo, Enrico G.; Pagliuca, Silvana; Lusignani, Maura",Front Psychol,227,30

Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 48 frozen ALF samples from 47 severe pneumonia cases admitted to Children's Hospital of Fudan University from January 1, 2019, to March 31, 2019. All samples were tested by a multiplex PCR (Multi-PCR) assay and a TAS assay. The results of the TAS panels were parallel compared with Multi-PCR and Conventional Tests (CT) including culture, direct fluorescent antibody method (DFA), and singleplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: The proportion of pathogens detection by CT was 81.2% (39/48). The 8 common respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (ADV), influenza A virus (FLUA), influenza B virus (FLUB), parainfluenza virus 1–3 (PIV1-3), and human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) were found in 31.2% (15/48) of the 48 samples by DFA. With the criteria of CT results used as “Golden Standard” for determing of TAS results, the proportion of pathogens detection by TAS was 70.8% (34/48). The difference of proportion of pathogens detection between TAS and CT was not statistically significant (p = 0.232). The sensitivity and specificity of TAS for pathogens detection based on CT were 87.1% (95% CI, 71.77–95.18%) and 100.0% (95% CI, 62.88–100%), the positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 100.0% (95% CI, 87.35–100%) and 64.2% (95% CI, 35.62–86.02%), respectively. While Multi-PCR results were used as “Golden Standard,” the total pathogens detection rate of TAS was 83.3% (40/48), which had a significant difference with that of Multi-PCR (p = 0.003). The sensitivity and PPV of TAS compared with Multi-PCR were 83.3% (95% CI, 69.23–92.03%) and 100.0% (95% CI, 89.08–100%), respectively. High rates of co-infection were proved by CT, Multi-PCR, and TAS. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) and ADV were the two most frequently detected pathogens in all three assays. Conclusion: Compared with the CT and Multi-PCR methods, this TAS assay had a good performance in detecting bacteriological and viral pathogens from ALF. More research is needed to establish interpretation criteria based on TAS reads or analysis platforms.","Li, Fei; Wang, Yin; Zhang, Yuhan; Shi, Peng; Cao, Linfeng; Su, LiYun; Zhu, Qiguo; Wang, Libo; Lu, Roujian; Tan, Wenjie; Shen, Jun",Front Pediatr,227,30

It remains unknown whether findings are applicable to UK health care staff and whether psychological support based on generic approaches is effective. We administered an online survey at a leading neuroscience hospital in the UK to examine how individual staff characteristics contribute to distress, concerns, and interventions most valued during the COVID‐19 pandemic. We found a high incidence of distress, particularly in females and staff with previous mental health history. Concerns fell into three factors: ‘risk of infection’, ‘work challenges’, and ‘social change’, and were affected by professional role and contact with COVID‐19 patients. These three factors predicted distress. Psychological support and clear updates were deemed most useful, with specific needs affected by age, professional role, and contact with COVID‐19 patients. This is the first documentation of a high incidence of psychological distress predicted by three types of concerns in health care workers of a neuroscience hospital. Distress, concerns, and interventions most valued were all affected by individual staff characteristics. These findings highlight the importance of providing stratified, one to one support interventions, tailored to professional group, and background, rather than more generic approaches. PRACTITIONER POINTS: The COVID‐19 pandemic has resulted in a high incidence of psychological distress in UK health care staff. Distress, concerns, and interventions most valued are influenced by individual staff characteristics.

Although several of these viruses are zoonotic, the majority are not. Astroviruses, transmitted fecal-orally, are commonly detected in a wide diversity of bat species, are prevalent at high rates and are not thought to directly infect humans. These features make astroviruses useful in examining virus evolutionary history, epidemiology in the host, and temporal shedding trends. Our study screened for the presence of astroviruses in bats in Singapore, reconstructed the phylogenetic relations of the polymerase genes and tested for population characteristics associated with infection. Of the seven species screened, astroviruses were detected in Rhinolophus lepidus and Eonycteris spelaea. The R. lepidus sequences grouped with other Rhinolophus astrovirus sequences from China and Laos, while the Eoncyteris sequences formed a distinct clade with astroviruses from Rousettus spp. in Laos and Pteropus giganteus in Bangladesh, but not with other E. spelaea sequences. Longitudinal collections of Eonycteris feces demonstrated variable shedding. Juvenile status of bats was a risk factor for astroviruses. This study highlights the diversity of astroviruses in nectivorous and insectivorous bats in Singapore and provides a predictive framework for understanding astrovirus infection in these bats. It also suggests that in addition to host phylogenetic relatedness, host ecology, such as roosting behavior, may drive co-infections, virus maintenance and spillover.","Mendenhall, Ian H.; Skiles, Maggie M.; Neves, Erica Sena; Borthwick, Sophie A.; Low, Dolyce H.W.; Liang, Benjamin; Lee, Benjamin P.Y.-H.; Su, Yvonne C.F.; Smith, Gavin J.D.",One Health,227,28

Our rationale for targeting RNA viral infections by pro-oxidants is routed on the mechanistic hypothesis that ROS based treatment paradigm could impair RNA integrity faster than the other macromolecules. Though antiviral drugs with antioxidant properties confer potential abilities for preventing viral entry, those with pro-oxidant properties could induce the degradation of nascent viral RNA within the host cells, as RNAs are highly prone to ROS mediated degradation than DNA/proteins. We have previously established that Plumbagin is a highly potent ROS inducer, which acts through shifting of the host redox potential. Besides, it has been reported that Plumbagin treatment has the potential for interrupting viral RNA replication within the host cells. Since the on-going Corona Virus Disease - 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic mediated by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) exhibits high infectivity, the development of appropriate antiviral therapeutic strategies remains to be an urgent unmet race against time. Therefore, additional experimental validation is warranted to determine the appropriateness of repurposable drug candidates, possibly ROS inducers, for fighting the pandemic which could lead to saving many lives from being lost to COVID-19.","Nadhan, Revathy; Patra, Dipyaman; Krishnan, Neethu; Rajan, Arathi; Gopala, Srinivas; Ravi, Dashnamoorthy; Srinivas, Priya",Eur J Pharmacol,227,27

The RNA genome is the template for synthesis of additional RNA strands. During replication of RNA viruses, there are at least three types of RNA that must be synthesized: the genome, a copy of the genome (copy genome), and mRNAs. Some RNA viruses also synthesize copies of subgenomic mRNAs. RdRp is the key player for all of these processes. RdRps of all RNA viruses probably arose from a common ancestor. The RdRp and other proteins required for viral genome synthesis are often called the replicase complex. The replicase complex consists of the set of proteins required to produce infectious genomes. In addition to the RdRp, the replicase complex may contain RNA-helicases (to unwind highly base-paired regions of the RNA genome) and NTPases (to supply energy for the polymerization process). The number of proteins in the replicase complex differs among virus families. There may also be a requirement for host cell proteins. The RNA virus group can be subdivided based on the type of RNA that serves as the genome. Positive or plus (+)-strand RNA viruses have genomes that are functional mRNAs. Their genomes are translated shortly after penetration into the host cell to produce the RdRp (and other viral proteins) required for synthesis of additional viral RNAs. Positive-strand RNA viruses often use large complexes of cellular membranes for genome replication. They actively modify host cell membranes to construct viral replication scaffolds. There are three groups of RNA viruses whose genomes are not mRNAs. They are the negative- or minus-strand RNA viruses, the closely related ambisense RNA viruses, and double-stranded RNA viruses. For each of these groups of viruses, the first synthetic event after genome penetration is transcription. This is accomplished by viral proteins (including the RdRp) that enter cell with the genome.","Payne, Susan",Viruses,227,28

Natural agents with immune-promoting potentials such as bee products are being explored as possible treatments. Bee honey and propolis are rich in bioactive compounds that express strong antimicrobial, bactericidal, antiviral, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antioxidant activities. This review examined the literature for the anti-COVID-19 effects of bee honey and propolis, with the aim of optimizing the use of these handy products as prophylactic or adjuvant treatments for people infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Molecular simulations show that flavonoids in propolis and honey (e.g., rutin, naringin, caffeic acid phenyl ester, luteolin, and artepillin C) may inhibit viral spike fusion in host cells, viral-host interactions that trigger the cytokine storm, and viral replication. Similar to the potent antiviral drug remdesivir, rutin, propolis ethanolic extract, and propolis liposomes inhibited non-structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, and these compounds along with naringin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in Vero E6 cells. Propolis extracts delivered by nanocarriers exhibit better antiviral effects against SARS-CoV-2 than ethanolic extracts. In line, hospitalized COVID-19 patients receiving green Brazilian propolis or a combination of honey and Nigella sativa exhibited earlier viral clearance, symptom recovery, discharge from the hospital as well as less mortality than counterparts receiving standard care alone.

Epidemiological studies of these viruses in bats often utilize serology to describe viral dynamics, with particular attention paid to juveniles, whose birth increases the overall susceptibility of the population to a viral outbreak once maternal immunity wanes. However, little is understood about bat immunology, including the duration of maternal antibodies in neonates. Understanding duration of maternally derived immunity is critical for characterizing viral dynamics in bat populations, which may help assess the risk of spillover to humans. We conducted two separate studies of pregnant Pteropus bat species and their offspring to measure the half-life and duration of antibodies to 1) canine distemper virus antigen in vaccinated captive Pteropus hypomelanus; and 2) Hendra virus in wild-caught, naturally infected Pteropus alecto. Both of these pteropid bat species are known reservoirs for henipaviruses. We found that in both species, antibodies were transferred from dam to pup. In P. hypomelanus pups, titers against CDV waned over a mean period of 228.6 days (95% CI: 185.4–271.8) and had a mean terminal phase half-life of 96.0 days (CI 95%: 30.7–299.7). In P. alecto pups, antibodies waned over 255.13 days (95% CI: 221.0–289.3) and had a mean terminal phase half-life of 52.24 days (CI 95%: 33.76–80.83).

They are cleaved off upon the passenger protein reaching its destination. The explosive growth in sequencing technologies has led to the deposition of vast numbers of protein sequences necessitating rapid functional annotation techniques, with subcellular localization being a key feature. Of the myriad software prediction tools developed to automate the task of assigning the SP cleavage site of these new sequences, we review here, the performance and reliability of commonly used SP prediction tools. RESULTS: The available signal peptide data has been manually curated and organized into three datasets representing eukaryotes, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. These datasets are used to evaluate thirteen prediction tools that are publicly available. SignalP (both the HMM and ANN versions) maintains consistency and achieves the best overall accuracy in all three benchmarking experiments, ranging from 0.872 to 0.914 although other prediction tools are narrowing the performance gap. CONCLUSION: The majority of the tools evaluated in this study encounter no difficulty in discriminating between secretory and non-secretory proteins. The challenge clearly remains with pinpointing the correct SP cleavage site. The composite scoring schemes employed by SignalP may help to explain its accuracy. Prediction task is divided into a number of separate steps, thus allowing each score to tackle a particular aspect of the prediction.","Choo, Khar Heng; Tan, Tin Wee; Ranganathan, Shoba",BMC Bioinformatics,227,0

However, as a reductionist approach, the conformation of NSP1– C terminal region (NSP1-CTR; amino acids 131–180) has not been studied in isolation. We found that NSP1-CTR conformation is disordered in an aqueous solution. Further, we examined the conformational propensity towards alpha-helical structure using trifluoroethanol, we observed induction of helical structure conformation using CD spectroscopy. Additionally, in SDS, NSP1-CTR shows a conformational change from disordered to ordered, possibly gaining alpha-helix in part. But in the presence of neutral lipid DOPC, a slight change in conformation is observed, which implies the possible role of hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic interaction on the conformational changes of NSP1. Fluorescence-based studies have shown a blue shift and fluorescence quenching in the presence of SDS, TFE, and lipid vesicles. In agreement with these results, fluorescence lifetime and fluorescence anisotropy decay suggest a change in conformational dynamics. The zeta potential studies further validated that the conformational dynamics are primarily because of hydrophobic interaction. These experimental studies were complemented through Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, which have shown a good correlation and testifies our experiments. We believe that the intrinsically disordered nature of the NSP1-CTR will have implications for enhanced molecular recognition feature properties of this IDR, which may add disorder to order transition and disorder-based binding promiscuity with its interacting proteins.","Kumar, Amit; Kumar, Ankur; Kumar, Prateek; Garg, Neha; Giri, Rajanish",Curr Res Virol Sci,227,1

Results: The data showed how depressive symptomatology increased significantly over time, while anxiety and PTSD did not show statistically significant changes. Spiritual well-being and loneliness were the main predictors of psychological impact. A younger age was a significant predictor of depression and anxiety, while female gender was associated with anxiety and PTSD. Conclusions: The impact of the pandemic is sustained over time, even increasing in depression, and vulnerable groups that need greater psychological health support could be identified.","González-Sanguino, Clara; Ausín, Berta; Castellanos, Miguel Ángel; Saiz, Jesús; López-Gómez, Aída; Ugidos, Carolina; Muñoz, Manuel",Front Psychiatry,227,18

The aim of this meta-analysis was to estimate the proportion and mortality of SARS-COV-2 in these patients. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was carried out in PubMed, Web of Sciences, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CNKI, SciELO, and other databases to identify all relevant studies published up to 10 January, 2020. The proportion and mortality in the patients were assessed by odd ratio (OR) and the corresponding 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI). RESULTS: A total of ten case-series including 11,755 cases with SARS-COV-2 infection and 942 deaths were selected. Among them, there were total of 791 DM patients with 186 deaths, 225 CKD patients with 45 deaths, 790 hypertension cases with 86 deaths, and 471 CVDs cases with 60 deaths. Pooled data revealed that the proportion of SARS-COV-2 infection in the patients with hypertension, DM, CVDs and CKD were 21.1 %, 16.3 %, 14.0 % and 5.0 %, respectively. Moreover, the SARS-COV-2 infection were associated with an increased risk of mortality in DM (OR = 0.549, CI 95 % 0.448–0.671, p ≤ 0.001) and CKD (OR = 0.552, 95 % CI 0.367–0.829, p = 0.004) patients, but not hypertension and CVDs. There was no publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: Our pooled data showed that the proportion of SARS-COV-2 infection was the highest in the Iranian patients with hypertension (21.1 %) followed by DM (16.3 %), CVDs (14.0 %) and CKD (5.0 %). Moreover, DM and CKD in patients with SARS-COV-2 infection were associated with a 0.549 and 0.552-fold increase in mortality, respectively. Clinicians in Iran should be aware of these findings, to identifying patients at higher risk and inform interventions to reduce the risk of death. Moreover, well-designed, large-scale and multicenter studies are needed to improve and validate our findings.","Mirjalili, Hamid; Dastgheib, Seyed Alireza; Shaker, Seyed Hossein; Bahrami, Reza; Mazaheri, Mahta; Sadr-Bafghi, Seyed Mohamad Hossein; Sadeghizadeh-Yazdi, Jalal; Neamatzadeh, Hossein",J Diabetes Metab Disord,227,1

For some people, being exposed to non-traumatic but stressful events could trigger the onset and relapse of mood disorders. Furthermore, non-traumatic stressful events also cause event-related psychological distress (ERPD), similar to that of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD; i.e., intense intrusive imagery or memory recall, avoidance, and hyperarousal) in the general population and individuals with mood disorders. However, previous ERPD studies only showed that people with ERPD display PTSD-like symptoms after non-traumatic experiences; they failed to get to the crux of the matter by only utilizing trauma- or PTSD-related assessment tools. We thus aimed to identify the psychological phenomena and features of ERPD after individuals experienced non-traumatic stressful events, and to develop and validate an appropriate ERPD assessment tool. First, we conducted a qualitative study to obtain the psychological features through interviews with 22 individuals (mean age = 41.50 years old, SD = 12.24) with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. Second, in the quantitative component, we implemented a web-based survey with 747 participants of the general population (mean age = 41.96 years old, SD = 12.64) by using ERPD-related questionnaires created based on the qualitative study; then, we examined the reliability and validity of the ERPD assessment tool. Results yielded that the psychological features of ERPD comprised four factors: feelings of revenge, rumination, self-denial, and mental paralysis. These were utilized in the developed 24-item measure of ERPD—a novel self-report assessment tool. For various professionals involved in mental healthcare, this tool can be used to clarify and assess psychological phenomena in people with ERPD.","Seki, Ryota; Hashimoto, Tasuku; Tanaka, Mami; Ishii, Hiroki; Ogawa, Michi; Sato, Aiko; Kimura, Atsushi; Shiina, Akihiro; Nakazato, Michiko; Iyo, Masaomi",PLoS One,227,1

In this prospective cohort study, we assessed neurological and cognitive symptoms in hospitalized coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) patients and aimed to determine their neuronal correlates. Patients with reverse transcription-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 infection who required inpatient treatment primarily because of non-neurological complications were screened between 20 April 2020 and 12 May 2020. Patients (age > 18 years) were included in our cohort when presenting with at least one new neurological symptom (defined as impaired gustation and/or olfaction, performance < 26 points on a Montreal Cognitive Assessment and/or pathological findings on clinical neurological examination). Patients with ≥2 new symptoms were eligible for further diagnostics using comprehensive neuropsychological tests, cerebral MRI and (18)fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET as soon as infectivity was no longer present. Exclusion criteria were: premorbid diagnosis of cognitive impairment, neurodegenerative diseases or intensive care unit treatment. Of 41 COVID-19 inpatients screened, 29 patients (65.2 ± 14.4 years; 38% female) in the subacute stage of disease were included in the register. Most frequently, gustation and olfaction were disturbed in 29/29 and 25/29 patients, respectively. Montreal Cognitive Assessment performance was impaired in 18/26 patients (mean score 21.8/30) with emphasis on frontoparietal cognitive functions. This was confirmed by detailed neuropsychological testing in 15 patients. (18)FDG PET revealed pathological results in 10/15 patients with predominant frontoparietal hypometabolism. This pattern was confirmed by comparison with a control sample using voxel-wise principal components analysis, which showed a high correlation (R(2) = 0.62) with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment performance. Post-mortem examination of one patient revealed white matter microglia activation but no signs of neuroinflammation. Neocortical dysfunction accompanied by cognitive decline was detected in a relevant fraction of patients with subacute COVID-19 initially requiring inpatient treatment. This is of major rehabilitative and socioeconomic relevance.","Hosp, Jonas A; Dressing, Andrea; Blazhenets, Ganna; Bormann, Tobias; Rau, Alexander; Schwabenland, Marius; Thurow, Johannes; Wagner, Dirk; Waller, Cornelius; Niesen, Wolf D; Frings, Lars; Urbach, Horst; Prinz, Marco; Weiller, Cornelius; Schroeter, Nils; Meyer, Philipp T",Brain,227,18

STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. METHODS: A 78-question survey was distributed to otologists and neurotologists between May 12, 2020 and June 8, 2020 to assess the impact of the pandemic on surgical practices. Sections within the survey delineated time periods: prior to the crisis, onset of the crisis, during the crisis, postcrisis transition. RESULTS: Of 396 survey respondents, 284 participants from 38 countries met inclusion criteria.Respondents were 16.9% female and 82.4% male, with a most common age range of 40 to 49 years (36.3%). 69.8% of participants had been in practice for over 10âyears and most respondents worked in an academic medical center (79.2%). The average operative weekly caseload was 5.3 (SD 3.9) per surgeon prior to the crisis, 0.7 (SD 1.2) during the COVID-19 crisis, and 3.5 (SD 3.3) for those who had begun a postcrisis transition at the time of survey administration (pâ<â0.001). 71.5% of providers did not perform an elective otologic or neurotologic operative procedure during the initial crisis period. 49.8% reported modifying their surgical technique due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Use of powered air-purifying respirators and filtering facepiece 2 or 3 (FFP2/FFP3) respirators were in minimal supply for 66.9% and 62.3% of respondents, respectively.

Consequently, immunoassays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with high specificity and positive predictive values are needed to obtain an accurate epidemiological picture. As more data accumulate about the immune responses and the kinetics of neutralizing-antibody (nAb) production in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals, new applications are forecast for serological assays such as nAb activity prediction in convalescent-phase plasma from recovered patients. This multicenter study, involving six hospital centers, determined the baseline clinical performances, reproducibility, and nAb level correlations of 10 commercially available immunoassays. In addition, three lateral-flow chromatography assays were evaluated, as these devices can be used in logistically challenged areas. All assays were evaluated using the same patient panels in duplicate, thus enabling accurate comparison of the tests. Seven immunoassays examined in this study were shown to have excellent specificity (98 to 100%) and good to excellent positive predictive values (82 to 100%) when used in a low (5%)-seroprevalence setting. We observed sensitivities as low as 74% and as high as 95% at ≥15 days after symptom onset. The determination of optimized cutoff values through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses had a significant impact on the diagnostic resolution of several enzyme immunoassays by increasing the sensitivity significantly without a large trade-off in specificity. We found that spike-based immunoassays seem to be better correlates of nAb activity. Finally, the results reported here will add to the general knowledge of the interlaboratory reproducibility of clinical performance parameters of immunoassays and provide new evidence about nAb activity prediction.","Therrien, C.; Serhir, B.; Bélanger-Collard, M.; Skrzypczak, J.; Shank, D.

The chapter also focuses on the need for a building’s interior air quality, as this is one of the most pivotal factors in maintaining building occupants’ safety, productivity, and well-being. Other important factors that are focused on are ventilation and filtration, including air cleaners and ventilation systems. The leading inorganic indoor contaminants are discussed such as asbestos, radon, and lead, exposure to which can create significant health risks. Likewise, organic contaminants including aldehydes, volatile organic compounds/semivolatile organic compounds, and pesticides are examined and analyzed. Several combustion-generated contaminates such as carbon dioxide, water, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen oxides are also looked into.

Social distancing norms reduce airplane capacity by keeping the middle seats unoccupied, while an imposed aisle social distance between boarding passengers slows the boarding. Recent literature suggests the Reverse Pyramid boarding method is a promising way to reduce health risk and keep boarding times low when 10 apron buses (essentially 10 boarding groups) are used to transport passengers from the airport terminal to a two-door airplane. We adapt the Reverse Pyramid method for social distancing when an airplane is boarded using a jet bridge that connects the terminal the airplane’s front door. We vary the number of boarding groups from two to six and use stochastic simulation and agent-based modelling to show the resulting impact on four performance evaluation metrics. Increasing the number of boarding groups from two to six reduces boarding time only up to four groups but continues to reduce infection risk up to six groups. If the passengers carry fewer luggage aboard the airplane, health risks (as well as boarding times) decrease. One adaptation of the Reverse Pyramid (RP) method (RP-Spread) provides slightly faster boarding times than the other (RP-Steep), when luggage volumes are high, while RP-Steep results in less risk to window seat passengers from later-boarding passengers walking by their row. Increasing the minimum aisle social distance from 1 m to 2 m increases boarding times but results in lower health risks to passengers walking down the aisle and to the previously seated passengers they pass.","Milne, R.

However, the mutational impact on viral spread and vaccine efficacy remains to be defined. Here we engineer the D614G mutation in the SARS-CoV-2 USA-WA1/2020 strain and characterize its effect on viral replication, pathogenesis, and antibody neutralization. The D614G mutation significantly enhances SARS-CoV-2 replication on human lung epithelial cells and primary human airway tissues, through an improved infectivity of virions with the spike receptor-binding domain in an “up” conformation for binding to ACE2 receptor. Hamsters infected with D614 or G614 variants developed similar levels of weight loss. However, the G614 virus produced higher infectious titers in the nasal washes and trachea, but not lungs, than the D614 virus. The hamster results confirm clinical evidence that the D614G mutation enhances viral loads in the upper respiratory tract of COVID-19 patients and may increases transmission. For antibody neutralization, sera from D614 virus-infected hamsters consistently exhibit higher neutralization titers against G614 virus than those against D614 virus, indicating that (i) the mutation may not reduce the ability of vaccines in clinical trials to protect against COVID-19 and (ii) therapeutic antibodies should be tested against the circulating G614 virus before clinical development.","Shi, Pei-Yong; Plante, Jessica; Liu, Yang; Liu, Jianying; Xia, Hongjie; Johnson, Bryan; Lokugamage, Kumari; Zhang, Xianwen; Muruato, Antonio; Zou, Jing; Fontes-Garfias, Camila; Mirchandani, Divya; Scharton, Dionna; Kalveram, Birte; Bilello, John; Ku, Zhiqiang; An, Zhiqiang; Freiberg, Alexander; Menachery, Vineet; Xie, Xuping; Plante, Kenneth; Weaver, Scott",Res Sq,227,1

Often overlooked is the potential contamination of the waste disposed by individuals diagnosed with the virus. The proliferation of contaminated waste is expected to increase as cases increase. The pandemic has caused a surge in waste material stemming from the widespread use of disposable personal protective equipment at the household level. In the developing countries where waste management measures are relatively inadequate, the vulnerability of COVID-19 contraction from contaminated waste is high. This study intended to unravel the susceptibility of communities in the developing countries of Guyana and Nigeria to the potential spread of the virus through waste. The study explored the possibility of cross-contamination between residents and landfill scavengers, the community perception on the effectiveness of their solid waste practices, the notable changes in waste collection and waste disposal patterns, and also, the potential knowledge / policy gaps that exist. An online survey was administered within all the districts of the two countries and the qualitative assessment was conducted demonstrating the proportional trends in the responses of the participants. Findings showed that the communities were relatively perceptive about the issue of waste disposal and the potential contamination of COVID-19. The communities readily recognized the inefficiencies of the waste management systems and the need for policy intervention. Tackling the issue of COVID-19 and waste management in the developing countries of Guyana and Nigeria requires policies that are holistic and participatory involving stakeholder at all levels.","Oyedotun, Temitope D.

Whether the current COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacts cardiovascular health is unclear. The aim of the rapid review was to investigate, whether COVID-19 lockdown influences modifiable cardiovascular risk factors (i.e., physical inactivity, sedentary behaviour, smoking, alcohol use, unhealthy diet, obesity, bad blood lipids, and hypertension) in the general population. Medline and EMBASE were searched until March 2021. Title, abstracts, and full texts were screened by one reviewer and 20% by a second reviewer. Only studies using probability sampling were included in order to ensure the representativeness of the target population. Data extraction and critical appraisal were done by one reviewer and double-checked by another reviewer. We identified 32 studies that fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Findings show that physical activity decreased, and sedentary behaviour increased among all age groups during the COVID-19 lockdown. Among adults, alcohol consumption increased, dietary quality worsened, and the amount of food intake increased. Some adults reported weight gain. Studies on children and adolescents were sparse. This rapid review found a high number of epidemiological studies on the impact of COVID-19 lockdown measures on modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, but only a few used probability sampling methods.","Freiberg, Alice; Schubert, Melanie; Romero Starke, Karla; Hegewald, Janice; Seidler, Andreas",Int J Environ Res Public Health,227,5

Although nucleic acid testing of SARS-CoV-2 is still the gold standard for diagnosis, there are well-recognized early-detection problems including time-consuming in the diagnosis process, noticeable false negative rate in the early stage and lacking nucleic acid testing kits in some areas. Therefore, effective and rational applications of imaging technologies are critical in aiding the screen and helping the diagnosis of suspected patients. Currently, chest computed tomography is recommended as the first-line imaging test for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia, which could allow not only early detection of the typical chest manifestations, but also timely estimation of the disease severity and therapeutic effects. In addition, other radiological methods including chest X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission computed tomography also show significant advantages in the detection of COVID-19 pneumonia. This review summarizes the applications of radiology and nuclear medicine in detecting and diagnosing COVID-19. It highlights the importance for these technologies to curb the rapid transmission during the pandemic, considering findings from special groups such as children and pregnant women.","Li, Jingwen; Xi, Long; Wang, Xinyi; Fang, Fang; Lv, Xuefei; Zhang, Dandan; Sun, U; Shaoping, Hu; Lin, Zhicheng; Xiong, Nian",Diagn Interv Imaging,227,16

Thus, the present work aims to develop a methodology using a machine learning algorithm (Support Vector Machine) for the prediction and discrimination of patients affected by Covid-19 and arboviruses (DENV, ZIKV and CHIKV). Clinical data from 204 patients with both Covid-19 and arboviruses obtained from 23 scientific articles and 1 dataset were used. The developed model was able to predict 93.1% of Covid-19 cases and 82.1% of arbovirus cases, with an accuracy of 89.1% and Area under Roc Curve of 95.6%, proving to be effective in prediction and possible screening of these patients, especially those affected by Covid-19, allowing early isolation","Santos Castro, J.
