Overt disease is mainly associated with homozygosity for the C282Y variant, although the H63D variant in compound heterozygosity with C282Y (C282Y/H63D) contributes to disease manifestation. In this observational study, we describe the association between biochemical findings, age, gender and HFE genotype in patients referred from general practice to a tertiary care referral center for diagnostic workup based on suspected hemochromatosis due to persistent hyperferritinemia and HFE variants. C282Y and H63D homozygosity were, respectively, the most and least prevalent genotypes and we found a considerable variation in transferrin saturation and ferritin levels independent of HFE genotype, which may indeed represent a diagnostic challenge in general practice. While our results confirm C282Y homozygosity as the major cause of iron accumulation, non-C282Y homozygotes also displayed mild to moderate hyperferritinemia with median ferritin levels at 500–700 µg/L, well above the reference cut-off. Such findings have traditionally been ignored in the clinic, and initiation of iron depletion has largely been restricted to C282Y homozygotes. Nevertheless, superfluous iron can aggravate pathogenesis in combination with other diseases and risk factors, such as inflammation, cancer and hepatopathy, and this possibility should not be neglected by clinicians.","Sandnes, Miriam; Vorland, Marta; Ulvik, Rune J.; Reikvam, Håkon",Genes (Basel),867,18

Patients often experience a constellation of other typical symptoms including fatigue, exercise intolerance and gastrointestinal distress. A typical patient with POTS is a female of child-bearing age, who often first displays symptoms in adolescence. The onset of POTS may be precipitated by immunological stressors such as a viral infection. A variety of pathophysiologies are involved in the abnormal postural tachycardia response; however, the pathophysiology of the syndrome is incompletely understood and undoubtedly multifaceted. Clinicians and researchers focused on POTS convened at the National Institutes of Health in July 2019 to discuss the current state of understanding of the pathophysiology of POTS and to identify priorities for POTS research. This article, the first of two articles summarizing the information discussed at this meeting, summarizes the current understanding of this disorder and best practices for clinical care. The evaluation of a patient with suspected POTS should seek to establish the diagnosis, identify co-morbid conditions, and exclude conditions that could cause or mimic the syndrome. Once diagnosed, management typically begins with patient education and non-pharmacologic treatment options. Various medications are often used to address specific symptoms, but there are currently no FDA-approved medications for the treatment of POTS, and evidence for many of the medications used to treat POTS is not robust.","Vernino, Steven; Bourne, Kate M; Stiles, Lauren E; Grubb, Blair P; Fedorowski, Artur; Stewart, Julian M; Arnold, Amy C; Pace, Laura A; Axelsson, Jonas; Boris, Jeffrey R; Moak, Jeffrey P; Goodman, Brent P; Chémali, Kamal R; Chung, Tae H; Goldstein, David S; Diedrich, Andre; Miglis, Mitchell G; Cortez, Melissa M; Miller, Amanda J; Freeman, Roy; Biaggioni, Italo; Rowe, Peter C; Sheldon, Robert S; Shibao, Cyndya A; Systrom, David M; Cook, Glen A; Doherty, Taylor A; Abdallah, Hasan I; Darbari, Anil; Raj, Satish R",Autonomic neuroscience : basic & clinical,867,26

Zonisamide (ZNS) was originally developed as an antiepileptic drug. Studies have shown that ZNS suppresses ER stress-induced neuronal cell damage in the experimental models of Parkinson's disease. Herein, we investigated whether ZNS improved DCM by attenuating ER stress-induced apoptosis. C57BL/6J mice were fed with high-fat diet (HFD) and intraperitoneally injected with low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) to induce type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and then treated with ZNS (40 mg·kg-1·d-1, i.g.) for 16 weeks. We showed that ZNS administration slightly ameliorated the blood glucose levels, but significantly alleviated diabetes-induced cardiac dysfunction and hypertrophy. Furthermore, ZNS administration significantly inhibited the Bax and caspase-3 activity, upregulated Bcl-2 activity, and decreased the proportion of TUNEL-positive cells in heart tissues. We analyzed the hallmarks of ER stress in heart tissues, and revealed that ZNS administration significantly decreased the protein levels of GRP78, XBP-1s, ATF6, PERK, ATF4, and CHOP, and elevated Hrd1 protein. In high glucose (HG)-treated primary cardiomyocytes, application of ZNS (3 μM) significantly alleviated HG-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and apoptosis. ZNS application also suppressed activated ER stress in HG-treated cardiomyocytes. Moreover, preapplication of the specific ER stress inducer tunicamycin (10 ng/mL) eliminated the protective effects of ZNS against HG-induced cardiac hypertrophy and ER stress-mediated apoptosis. Our findings suggest that ZNS improves the cardiac diastolic function in diabetic mice and prevents T2DM-induced cardiac hypertrophy by attenuating ER stress-mediated apoptosis.","Tian, Jia-Hui; Wu, Qian; He, Yong-Xiang; Shen, Qi-Ying; Rekep, Mubarak; Zhang, Gui-Ping; Luo, Jian-Dong; Xue, Qin; Liu, Ying-Hua",Acta pharmacologica Sinica,867,1

Conversion from a rearfoot to non-rearfoot strike during running is effective at reducing knee pain in research environments. The purpose of this report was to demonstrate run retraining as a clinical intervention for service members with knee pain. METHODS Sixteen service members with running-related chronic knee pain underwent run retraining that converted foot strike from a rearfoot to a non-rearfoot strike using real-time visual feedback. The Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) and Numerical Pain Rating Scale (NPRS) for knee pain during running were assessed pretraining, at the final training session and at a 1-month follow-up. During running, foot inclination angle and vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) average loading rate were measured pretraining and at 1 month of follow-up. RESULTS Service members underwent 7.4±1.0 training sessions over the course of 15.8±4.6 days. LEFS improved by 8±6 points immediately after retraining, with an overall improvement of 10±6 points from pretraining to 1-month follow-up (p<0.01). NPRS improved by 2.0±0.4 points immediately after retraining, with an overall improvement of 2.0±0.4 points from pretraining to 1-month follow-up (p<0.01). Conversion to a non-rearfoot strike pattern was apparent at follow-up for all but two patients. VGRF average loading rate decreased by 56%±17% (p<0.01) from pretraining to 1-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS Knee pain and function improved as a result of non-rearfoot strike run retraining, which supports the clinical use of this evidence-based intervention.","Mazzone, Brittney; Yoder, A; Condon, R; Farrokhi, S",BMJ military health,867,5

However, a common limitation is inadequate reporting of the applicability of the intervention and trial results for people who are ""socially disadvantaged"" and this can affect policy-makers' decisions. We previously developed a framework for identifying health-equity-relevant trials, along with a reporting guideline for transparent reporting. In this study, we provide a descriptive assessment of health-equity considerations in 200 randomly sampled equity-relevant trials. METHODS We developed a search strategy to identify health-equity-relevant trials published between 2013 and 2015. We randomly sorted the 4316 records identified by the search and screened studies until 100 individually randomized (RCTs) and 100 cluster randomized controlled trials (CRTs) were identified. We developed and pilot-tested a data extraction form based on our initial work, to inform the development of our reporting guideline for equity-relevant randomized trials. RESULTS In total, 39 trials (20%) were conducted in a low- and middle-income country and 157 trials (79%) in a high-income country focused on socially disadvantaged populations (78% CRTs, 79% RCTs). Seventy-four trials (37%) reported a subgroup analysis across a population characteristic associated with disadvantage (25% CRT, 49% RCTs), with 19% of included studies reporting subgroup analyses across sex, 9% across race/ethnicity/culture, and 4% across socioeconomic status. No subgroup analyses were reported for place of residence, occupation, religion, education, or social capital. One hundred and forty-one trials (71%) discussed the applicability of their results to one or more socially disadvantaged populations (68% of CRT, 73% of RCT). DISCUSSION In this set of trials, selected for their relevance to health equity, data that were disaggregated for socially disadvantaged populations were rarely reported. We found that even when the data are available, opportunities to analyze health-equity considerations are frequently missed. The recently published equity extension of the Consolidated Reporting Standards for Randomized Trials (CONSORT-Equity) may help improve delineation of hypotheses related to socially disadvantaged populations, and transparency and completeness of reporting of health-equity considerations in RCTs. This study can serve as a baseline assessment of the reporting of equity considerations.","Petkovic, Jennifer; Jull, Janet; Yoganathan, Manosila; Dewidar, Omar; Baird, Sarah; Grimshaw, Jeremy M; Johansson, Kjell Arne; Kristjansson, Elizabeth; McGowan, Jessie; Moher, David; Petticrew, Mark; Robberstad, Bjarne; Shea, Beverley; Tugwell, Peter; Volmink, Jimmy; Wells, George A; Whitehead, Margaret; Cuervo, Luis Gabriel; White, Howard; Taljaard, Monica; Welch, Vivian",Trials,867,31

These disorders are characterized by deficits in fear extinction and dysfunction in underlying neural circuitry. Given the strong and pervasive link between childhood trauma and the development of psychopathology, fear extinction may be a key mechanism. The present study tests the impact of childhood trauma exposure on fear extinction and underlying neural circuitry. Children (N = 44, 45% trauma-exposed; 6-11 yrs) completed a novel two-day virtual reality fear extinction experiment. On day one, participants underwent fear conditioning and extinction. Twenty-four hours later, participants completed a test of extinction recall during fMRI. Conditioned fear was measured throughout the experiment using skin conductance and fear-related behavior, and activation in fear-related brain regions was estimated during recall. There were no group differences in conditioned fear during fear conditioning or extinction learning. During extinction recall, however, trauma-exposed children kept more distance from both the previously extinguished and the safety cue, suggesting poor differentiation between threat and safety cues. Trauma-exposed youth also failed to approach the previously extinguished cue over the course of extinction recall. The effects on fear-related behavior during extinction recall were accompanied by higher activation to the previously extinguished cue in fear-relevant brain regions, including the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula, in trauma-exposed relative to control children. Alterations in fear-related brain regions and fear-related behavior may be a core mechanism through which childhood trauma confers heightened vulnerability to psychopathology.","Marusak, Hilary A; Hehr, Aneesh; Bhogal, Amanpreet; Peters, Craig; Iadipaolo, Allesandra; Rabinak, Christine A",Behavioural brain research,867,26

The role of telehealth in ophthalmology has historically been limited to store-and-forwarding of images, much like what is used in radiology. PATIENTS AND METHODS Remote evaluation using two-way audio-video communications over the initial 10-week period of clinic shutdowns. Visual acuity (VA) measurement was attempted using a printed single surrounded HOTV or Snellen chart. The VA measurement of fellow eyes was compared to the prior in person clinical visit. External and strabismus examinations were also conducted. RESULTS Fifty-eight patients were evaluated with a mean age 12.5 years (range 5 months to 82 years). Twenty of 58 (34%) were younger than 5 years of age. Reasons for evaluation were strabismus in 26 patients (45%), refractive error in 25 (43%), and amblyopia in 10 patients (19%). Recognition visual acuity was obtained in 69% (40 of 58), including every patient older than 5 years of age. Nine children from 2 to 5 years of age (mean 3 years) were unable to perform HOTV VA testing. Of nine children unable to do complete VA testing, five had been premature and seven had developmental delay. There was a mean bias of -0.12 logMAR in favor of the prior in office test in the right eyes of 21 non-amblyopic patients. The 95% limits of agreement between the in-person visit and the subsequent telehealth video visit logMAR VA were +0.20 logMAR upper limit, -0.44 logMAR lower limit. CONCLUSIONS Telehealth video visits provided basic ophthalmic information in patients who are physically incapable to come to the office, leading to improved triage. Vision could be tested remotely in young children, but we found substantial variability in the measurement of clinically normal eyes. Improvements in the reliability of at-home visual acuity testing are needed.","Christoff, Alex; Guo, Xinxing; Repka, Michael X",Journal of binocular vision and ocular motility,867,16

They are based on the principles of monocausality of Henle and Koch and represent the most important group of monocausal infectious diseases. Tight ecological relations exist between epidemic diseases and environment. The ecosystem encloses all living organisms as well as the inanimate environment (e.g. soil, water, air, waste). Some chains of infections are demonstrated with American equine encephalitis, rabies, Aujeszky's disease, salmonellosis and so-called soil-born epidemic diseases as examples. Any change of the environment causes enduring effects on the development and progression of epidemic diseases. Many epidemic diseases correlate with certain geographical zones. The variation of climate for instance led to an alteration of the occurrence of epidemic diseases caused by streptococci and staphylococci. A further evidence for the relation of environment and occurrence of epidemic diseases are the seasonal and secular rhythmics in the progress of epidemic diseases. On the basic of new techniques (finger-printing, hybridisation, sequence analysis) the origin of new types of infectious diseases such as American equine encephalitis and infections with Parvo- and Corona viruses can be explained. Finally medicine has to face this thesis: In contrast to the Darwinian theory the recombination of two different infectious agents in a common host may cause evolutionary jumps.","Mayr, A",Zentralblatt fur Hygiene und Umweltmedizin = International journal of hygiene and environmental medicine,867,15

While large prospective randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) are lacking at this point in time, smaller observational studies and case series are reviewed to ascertain the indications and utility of NMBAs. Additionally, large RCTs that address similar clinical scenarios are reviewed and the authors translate these findings to patients with COVID-19. Specifically, NMBAs can be helpful during endotracheal intubation to minimize the risk of patient coughing and possibly infecting healthcare personnel. NMBAs can also be used in patients to promote patient-ventilator synchrony while reducing the driving pressure needed with mechanical ventilation, particularly in patients with the severe clinical presentation (Type H phenotype). Prone positioning has also become a cornerstone in managing refractory hypoxemia in patients with SARS-CoV-2 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and NMB can be useful in facilitating this maneuver. In the perioperative setting, deep levels of neuromuscular blockade can improve patient outcomes during laparoscopic operations and may theoretically reduce the risk of aerosolization as lower insufflation pressures may be utilized. Regardless of the indication, quantitative neuromuscular monitoring remains the only reliable method to confirm adequate recovery following cessation of neuromuscular blockade. Such monitors may serve a unique purpose in patients with COVID-19 as automation of measurements can reduce healthcare personnel - patient contact that would occur during periodic subjective evaluation with a peripheral nerve stimulator.","Chaves-Cardona, Harold E; Hernandez-Torres, Vivian R; Kiley, Sean; Renew, J Ross",Korean j. anesthesiol.,867,18

It applies to the context presented by the Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global outbreak of 2019, as well as to future pandemics. First, a Millian-liberal argument justifies lockdown measures in order to protect liberty under pandemic conditions, consistent with commonly accepted principles of public health ethics. Second, a wider argument contextualizes specific issues that attend acting on the justified lockdown for western liberal democratic states, as modeled on discourse and accounted for by Jürgen Habermas. The authors argue that a range of norms are constructed in societies that, justifiably, need to be curtailed for the pandemic. The state has to take on the unusual role of sole guardian of norms under emergency pandemic conditions. Consistently with both the Millian-liberal justification and elements of Habermasian discourse ethics, they argue that that role can only be justified where it includes strategy for how to return political decisionmaking to the status quo ante. This is because emergency conditions are only justified as a means to protecting prepandemic norms. To this end, the authors propose that an emergency power committee is necessary to guarantee that state action during pandemic is aimed at re-establishing the conditions of legitimacy of government action that ecological factors (a virus) have temporarily curtailed.","Rainey, Stephen; Giubilini, Alberto",Camb Q Healthc Ethics,867,18

This has implicated the eye as a portal of transmission. The aim of this systemic review is to summarise and discuss the current literature regarding ocular involvement of SARS-CoV-2 in COVID-19. Recent Findings: In this systematic review, the prevalence of ocular symptoms and signs was low (from 0 to 31.58%) and conjunctivitis was a relatively rare occurrence. The rate of detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the ocular swab samples was low as well and this ranged from 0 to 11.11%. The development of ocular symptoms and signs was not always accompanied by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in the ocular swab samples. The opposite was described as well. This may reflect issues related to the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and of the study design. Nonetheless, the nature of research in a pandemic is that conclusions can change as more information is obtained. Summary: Whilst the eye is unlikely to be a main transmission route, we need to consider the possibilities of conjunctivitis as a presenting complaint and of the eye playing a role in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, we need to take the appropriate precautions in our practice. Further studies are needed to evaluate the viral tropism of SARS-CoV-2 and its role in the eyes.","Cheong, Kai Xiong",Curr Ophthalmol Rep,867,18

Therefore, we aim to screen natural products library to find out potential COVID-19 Mpro inhibitors. Plant-based natural compounds from Sigma-Aldrich plant profiler chemical library have been screened through virtual molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation to identify potential inhibitors of COVID Mpro. Our virtual molecular docking results have shown that there are twenty-eight natural compounds with a greater binding affinity toward the COVID-19 Mpro inhibition site as compared to the co-crystal native ligand Inhibitor N3 (-7.9 kcal/mol). Also, molecular dynamics simulation results have confirmed that Peonidin 3-O-glucoside, Kaempferol 3-O-ß-rutinoside, 4-(3,4-Dihydroxyphenyl)-7-methoxy-5-[(6-O-ß-D-xylopyranosyl-ß-D-glucopyranosyl)oxy]-2H-1-benzopyran-2-one, Quercetin-3-D-xyloside, and Quercetin 3-O-&#945;-L-arabinopyranoside (selected based on the docking score) possess a significant amount of dynamic properties such as stability, flexibility and binding energy.

However, information on serum SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid(RNAemia) in patients affected by COVID-19 is limited. METHODS: Patients who admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, were tested SARS-COV-2 RNA in serum from January 28, 2020, to February 9, 2020. Demographic data, laboratory findings, radiological, comorbidities and outcomes data were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: 85 patients were included in the analysis. The viral load of throat swabs was significantly higher than serum samples. The highest detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in serum samples was between 11 to 15 days after the symptom onset. Analysis to compare with and without RNAemia provided evidence that CT and some laboratory biomarkers(total protein, BUN, LDH, hypersensitive troponin I and D-dimer) were abnormal, and that the extent of these abnormalities was generally higher in RNAemia than in non-RNAemia. Organ damages(respiratory failure, cardiac damage, renal damage and coagulopathy) were more common in RNAemia than non-RNAemia. Patients with vs without RNAemia had shorter durations from serum testing SARS-CoV-2 RNA. The mortality rate was higher among patients with vs without RNAemia. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence to support that SARS-CoV-2 may have an important role in multiple organ damage, such as respiratory failure, cardiac damage, renal damage and coagulopathy. We did not find strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 plays a role in damage of liver and the central nervous system. And our evidence suggests that RNAemia has a significant association with a higher risk of in-hospital mortality.","Xu, Dan; Zhou, Fuling; Sun, Wenbo; Chen, Liangjun; Lan, Lan; Li, Huan; Xiao, Feng; Li, Ying; Kolachalama, Vijaya B; Li, Yirong; Wang, Xinghuan; Xu, Haibo",Clin. infect. dis,867,16

It draws on material collected during an ongoing action research study aimed at addressing the everyday transport and mobility challenges faced by young women living in poor peripheral communities of three African cities – Abuja, Cape Town and Tunis. The project has the specific objective of supporting young women's improved access to employment opportunities through trialling various mobility/transport-related skills interventions (based on prior in-depth analysis of mobility constraints). With the onset of COVID-19 some readjustments to the research focus and planned interventions became necessary. The research teams, together with an NGO partner, are now working to chart how young women's everyday experiences of mobility and transport - both as transport users and as transport sector workers - are changing as processes of lockdown and their relaxation evolve. The paper covers the period from early 2019 through to March 2021, and offers reflections regarding ‘lived experiences’ of mobility practice pre-pandemic, during the pandemic, and the potential longer-term mobility-related impacts for women resident in low-income neighbourhoods in a post-COVID-19 era. This leads to consideration of key policy lessons. There is potential for prioritisation of Non-Motorised Transport interventions towards a green restart that would benefit women (for instance through promoting women's cycling), and for growing women's participation as transport operators, even perhaps the usage of drones to aid women's safer pedestrian travel. But such interventions will require far greater representation of women in COVID-19 and wider transport decision-making entities than has hitherto been the case. © 2021","Porter, G.; Murphy, E.; Adamu, F.; Dayil, P.

Unlike the disease in adults, the vast majority of children with COVID-19 have mild symptoms and are largely spared from severe respiratory disease. However, there are children who have significant respiratory disease, and some may develop a hyperinflammatory response similar to that seen in adults with COVID-19 and in children with Kawasaki disease (KD), which has been termed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). Objective: The purpose of this report was to examine the current evidence that supports the etiopathogenesis of COVID-19 in children and the relationship of COVID-19 with KD and MIS-C as a basis for a better understanding of the clinical course, diagnosis, and management of these clinically perplexing conditions. Results: The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is carried out in two distinct but overlapping phases of COVID-19: the first triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) itself and the second by the host immune response. Children with KD have fewer of the previously described COVID-19-associated KD features with less prominent acute respiratory distress syndrome and shock than children with MIS-C. Conclusion: COVID-19 in adults usually includes severe respiratory symptoms and pathology, with a high mortality. It has become apparent that children are infected as easily as adults but are more often asymptomatic and have milder disease because of their immature immune systems. Although children are largely spared from severe respiratory disease, they can present with a SARS-CoV-2-associated MIS-C similar to KD.","Frenkel, Lawrence D; Gomez, Fernando; Bellanti, Joseph A",Allergy Asthma Proc,867,16

Many of them have acquired SARS-CoV-2 and some have died. In Africa, where the pandemic is escalating, there are major gaps in response capacity, especially in human resources and protective equipment. We examine these challenges and propose interventions to protect healthcare workers on the continent, drawing on articles identified on Medline (Pubmed) in a search on 24 March 2020. Global jostling means that supplies of personal protective equipment are limited in Africa. Even low-cost interventions such as facemasks for patients with a cough and water supplies for handwashing may be challenging, as is 'physical distancing' in overcrowded primary health care clinics. Without adequate protection, COVID-19 mortality may be high among healthcare workers and their family in Africa given limited critical care beds and difficulties in transporting ill healthcare workers from rural to urban care centres. Much can be done to protect healthcare workers, however. The continent has learnt invaluable lessons from Ebola and HIV control. HIV counselors and community healthcare workers are key resources, and could promote social distancing and related interventions, dispel myths, support healthcare workers, perform symptom screening and trace contacts. Staff motivation and retention may be enhanced through carefully managed risk 'allowances' or compensation. International support with personnel and protective equipment, especially from China, could turn the pandemic's trajectory in Africa around. Telemedicine holds promise as it rationalises human resources and reduces patient contact and thus infection risks. Importantly, healthcare workers, using their authoritative voice, can promote effective COVID-19 policies and prioritization of their safety. Prioritizing healthcare workers for SARS-CoV-2 testing, hospital beds and targeted research, as well as ensuring that public figures and the population acknowledge the commitment of healthcare workers may help to maintain morale. Clearly there are multiple ways that international support and national commitment could help safeguard healthcare workers in Africa, essential for limiting the pandemic's potentially devastating heath, socio-economic and security impacts on the continent.","Chersich, Matthew F; Gray, Glenda; Fairlie, Lee; Eichbaum, Quentin; Mayhew, Susannah; Allwood, Brian; English, Rene; Scorgie, Fiona; Luchters, Stanley; Simpson, Greg; Haghighi, Marjan Mosalman; Pham, Minh Duc; Rees, Helen",Global Health,867,1

Just as epidemiology strives to create a horizontal picture of a disease-event with attention to region, timing, and scale, so too does epidemiological reading situate disparate texts in a single field of analysis, facilitating conversation between texts rather than solely relying on a hermeneutics of suspicion which, as Raza Kolb argues, resembles the depth-interior model of the clinical gaze. [...]in the first chapter she reads Rudyard Kipling’s Kim alongside narratives of how a sham public health campaign played a role in identifying and killing Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011. While the choice to whisk through so many different genres is not theorized, nor is it discussed how epidemiology may inform these genres in distinct ways, it aligns Raza Kolb’s approach with that of cultural studies, where texts from many genres are examined together as an archive of culture.

Platelets are recognized as mediators of inflammation, releasing proinflammatory and prothrombotic factors, and are hyperactivated in COVID-19 infected patients. Activated platelets have also been reported in type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients, putting these patients at higher risk for thromboembolic complications of COVID-19 infection. Methods: A case-control study of T2D (n=33) and control subjects (n=30) who underwent a hyperinsulinemic clamp to induce normoglycemia in T2D subjects: T2D: baseline glucose 7.5 ± 0.3mmol/l (135.1 ± 5.4mg/dl), reduced to 4.5 ± 0.07mmol/l (81 ± 1.2mg/dl) with 1-hour clamp; Controls: maintained at 5.1 ± 0.1mmol/l (91.9 ± 1.8mg/dl). Slow Off-rate Modified Aptamer (SOMA)-scan plasma protein measurement was used to determine a panel of platelet proteins. Results: Prothrombotic platelet proteins were elevated in T2D versus controls: platelet factor 4 (PF4, p<0.05); platelet glycoprotein VI (PGVI p<0.05); P-selectin (p<0.01) and plasminogen activator inhibitor I (PAI-1, p<0.01). In addition, the antithrombotic platelet-related proteins, plasmin (p<0.05) and heparin cofactor II (HCFII, p<0.05), were increased in T2D. Normalization of glucose in the T2D cohort had no effect on platelet protein levels. Conclusion: T2D patients have platelet hyperactivation, placing them at higher risk for thromboembolic events. When infected with COVID-19, this risk may be compounded, and their propensity for a more severe COVID-19 disease course increased.

Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in MIS-C patients and severe hyperinflammatory response ensues with potential for cardiac complications. The cause of MIS-C has not previously been identified. METHODS: Here, we analyzed biospecimens from 100 children: 19 children with MIS-C, 26 with acute COVID-19, and 55 controls. Stool was assessed for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and plasma was assessed for markers of breakdown of mucosal barrier integrity, including zonulin. Ultrasensitive antigen detection was used to probe for SARS-CoV-2 antigenemia in plasma, and immune responses were characterized. As proof of concept, we treated a MIS-C patient with larazotide, a zonulin antagonist, and monitored impact on antigenemia and clinical response. RESULTS: We showed that in MIS-C, prolonged presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the GI tract leads to release of zonulin, a biomarker of intestinal permeability, with subsequent trafficking of SARS-CoV-2 antigens into the bloodstream, leading to hyperinflammation. The MIS-C patient treated with larazotide displayed a coinciding decrease in plasma SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen levels, inflammatory markers, and a resultant clinical improvement above that achieved with currently available treatments. CONCLUSION: These mechanistic data of MIS-C pathogenesis provide insight into targets for diagnosing, treating, and preventing MIS-C, which are urgently needed for this increasingly common severe COVID-19-related disease in children.","Yonker, Lael M; Gilboa, Tal; Ogata, Alana F; Senussi, Yasmeen; Lazarovits, Roey; Boribong, Brittany P; Bartsch, Yannic C; Loiselle, Maggie; Noval Rivas, Magali; Porritt, Rebecca A; Lima, Rosiane; Davis, Jameson P; Farkas, Eva J; Burns, Madeleine D; Young, Nicola; Mahajan, Vinay S; Hajizadeh, Soroush; Herrera Lopez, Xcanda I; Kreuzer, Johannes; Morris, Robert; Martinez, Enid E; Han, Isaac; Griswold, Kettner; Barry, Nicholas C; Thompson, David B; Church, George; Edlow, Andrea G; Haas, Wilhelm; Pillai, Shiv; Arditi, Moshe; Alter, Galit; Walt, David R; Fasano, Alessio",J. clin. invest,867,18

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was highly infectious, and some complications emerged rapidly in some patients, including acute respiratory distress syndrome, and multiple organ failure. The virus could trigger a series of immune responses, which might lead to excessive immune activation, thereby bringing about the immune system imbalance of the body. Up to now, there was no specific antiviral drug, and we conjectured that immunomodulatory therapy might play an essential part in the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as adjuvant therapy.

There are worldwide descriptions of neurological deficits in COVID-19 patients. Central nervous system (CNS) symptoms can be present early in the course of the disease. As many as 55% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients have been reported to have neurological disturbances three months after infection by SARS-CoV-2. The mutability of the SARS-COV-2 virus and its potential to directly affect the CNS highlight the urgency of developing technology to diagnose, manage, and treat brain injury in COVID-19 patients. The pathobiology of CNS infection by SARS-CoV-2 and the associated neurological sequelae of this infection remain poorly understood. In this review, we outline the rationale for the use of blood biomarkers (BBs) for diagnosis of brain injury in COVID-19 patients, the research needed to incorporate their use into clinical practice, and the improvements in patient management and outcomes that can result. BBs of brain injury could potentially provide tools for detection of brain injury in COVID-19 patients. Elevations of BBs have been reported in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood of COVID-19 patients. BB proteins have been analyzed in CSF to detect CNS involvement in patients with infectious diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus and tuberculous meningitis. BBs are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for diagnosis of mild versus moderate traumatic brain injury and have identified brain injury after stroke, cardiac arrest, hypoxia, and epilepsy. BBs, integrated with other diagnostic tools, could enhance understanding of viral mechanisms of brain injury, predict severity of neurological deficits, guide triage of patients and assignment to appropriate medical pathways, and assess efficacy of therapeutic interventions in COVID-19 patients.","DeKosky, Steven T; Kochanek, Patrick M; Valadka, Alex B; Clark, Robert S B; Chou, Sherry H-Y; Au, Alicia K; Horvat, Christopher; Jha, Ruchira M; Mannix, Rebekah; Wisniewski, Stephen R; Wintermark, Max; Rowell, Susan E; Welch, Robert D; Lewis, Lawrence; House, Stacey; Tanzi, Rudolph E; Smith, Darci R; Vittor, Amy Y; Denslow, Nancy D; Davis, Michael D; Glushakova, Olena Y; Hayes, Ronald L",J Neurotrauma,867,1

OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to analyze the efficacy and safety of early anti-inflammatory treatment (AIT) with intravenous anakinra with or without glucocorticoids in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia. METHODS: We performed a retrospective single-center cohort study of patients admitted for COVID-19 pneumonia from February 26 to April 29, 2020, to assess the efficacy of early AIT with intravenous anakinra (100 mg every 8 hours for 3 days, with tapering) alone or in combination with a glucocorticoid (intravenous methylprednisolone, 1-2 mg/kg daily, with tapering). The standard of care (SOC) treatment was hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin with or without antivirals and anticoagulants. Late rescue AIT with anakinra or tocilizumab was also evaluated. Treatment effect on overall survival was assessed by a propensity score-adjusted Cox model. RESULTS: A total of 128 patients were analyzed; 63 patients received early AIT (30 received anakinra alone and 33 received anakinra plus a glucocorticoid) at admission, and 65 patients did not receive early AIT and were used as controls; of the latter 65 patients, 44 received the SOC treatment alone and 21 received the SOC treatment plus late rescue AIT. After adjustment for all the unbalanced baseline covariates, early AIT reduced the hazard of mortality by 74% (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 0.26; P < .001). The effect was similar in patients receiving anakinra alone (adjusted HR = 0.28; P = .04) and anakinra plus a glucocorticoid (adjusted HR = 0.33; P = .07). Late rescue treatment did not show a significant advantage over SOC treatment alone (adjusted HR = 0.82; P = .70).

PARTICIPANTS: The simulation included 100 000 agents, with a representative distribution of demographics and occupations. Networks of contacts were established to simulate potentially infectious interactions though occupation, household, and random interactions. INTERVENTIONS: Simulation of standard covid-19 vaccination versus delayed second dose vaccination prioritizing the first dose. The simulation runs were replicated 10 times. Sensitivity analyses included first dose vaccine efficacy of 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, and 90% after day 12 post-vaccination; vaccination rate of 0.1%, 0.3%, and 1% of population per day; assuming the vaccine prevents only symptoms but not asymptomatic spread (that is, non-sterilizing vaccine); and an alternative vaccination strategy that implements delayed second dose for people under 65 years of age, but not until all those above this age have been vaccinated. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative covid-19 mortality, cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infections, and cumulative hospital admissions due to covid-19 over 180 days. RESULTS: Over all simulation replications, the median cumulative mortality per 100 000 for standard dosing versus delayed second dose was 226 v 179, 233 v 207, and 235 v 236 for 90%, 80%, and 70% first dose efficacy, respectively. The delayed second dose strategy was optimal for vaccine efficacies at or above 80% and vaccination rates at or below 0.3% of the population per day, under both sterilizing and non-sterilizing vaccine assumptions, resulting in absolute cumulative mortality reductions between 26 and 47 per 100 000. The delayed second dose strategy for people under 65 performed consistently well under all vaccination rates tested. CONCLUSIONS: A delayed second dose vaccination strategy, at least for people aged under 65, could result in reduced cumulative mortality under certain conditions.","Romero-Brufau, Santiago; Chopra, Ayush; Ryu, Alex J; Gel, Esma; Raskar, Ramesh; Kremers, Walter; Anderson, Karen S; Subramanian, Jayakumar; Krishnamurthy, Balaji; Singh, Abhishek; Pasupathy, Kalyan; Dong, Yue; O039,; Horo, John C; Wilson, Walter R; Mitchell, Oscar; Kingsley, Thomas C",BMJ,867,29

In order to further validate this salivary biomarker, we investigated how periodontal bacteria, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and systemic and local host immune responses relate to CRS. Subgingival plaque, saliva, and serum samples collected from 445 individuals were used in the analyses. Plaque levels of 28 microbial species, especially those of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Tannerella forsythia, and serum and salivary levels of IgA and IgG against these five species were determined. Additionally, LPS activity was measured. High CRS associated strongly with all IgA/IgG antibody and LPS levels in saliva, whereas in serum the associations were not that obvious. In the final logistic regression model, the best predictors of high CRS were saliva IgA burden against the five species (OR 7.04, 95% CI 2.25-22.0), IgG burden (3.79, 1.78-8.08), LPS (2.19, 1.38-3.47), and the sum of 17 subgingival Gram-negative species (6.19, 2.10-18.3).

Effective testing allows infected individuals to be quarantined, thus reducing the spread of COVID-19, saving countless lives, and helping to restart the economy safely and securely. Developing a good testing strategy can be greatly aided by contact tracing that provides health care providers information about the whereabouts of infected patients in order to determine whom to test. Countries that have been more successful in corralling the virus typically use a ``test, treat, trace, test'' strategy that begins with testing individuals with symptoms, traces contacts of positively tested individuals via a combinations of patient memory, apps, WiFi, GPS, etc., followed by testing their contacts, and repeating this procedure. The problem is that such strategies are myopic and do not efficiently use the testing resources. This is especially the case with COVID-19, where symptoms may show up several days after the infection (or not at all, there is evidence to suggest that many COVID-19 carriers are asymptotic, but may spread the virus). Such greedy strategies, miss out population areas where the virus may be dormant and flare up in the future. In this paper, we show that the testing problem can be cast as a sequential learning-based resource allocation problem with constraints, where the input to the problem is provided by a time-varying social contact graph obtained through various contact tracing tools. We then develop efficient learning strategies that minimize the number of infected individuals. These strategies are based on policy iteration and look-ahead rules. We investigate fundamental performance bounds, and ensure that our solution is robust to errors in the input graph as well as in the tests themselves.","Singh, Rahul; Liu, Fang; Shroff, Ness B.",,867,1

In this process, a patient who tests positive for an infectious disease and public health officials work to identify the patient's close contacts, notify them of their risk of possible exposure to the disease, and provide resources to facilitate the decreased spreading of disease. Contact notification can be done physically in person, via phone call, or digitally through the use of media such as SMS and email. When alerts are made through the latter, it is called digital contact notification. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to perform a preliminary evaluation on the use of TellYourContacts.org, a COVID-19 digital contact notification tool that can be used confidentially and anonymously, to gather information about the quantity of website users and message senders, the types of messages sent, and the geographic distribution of senders. METHODS: Patients who chose to get tested for COVID-19 and subsequently tested positive for the disease were alerted of their positive results through Curative, Inc., a COVID-19 testing laboratory, and Healthvana, a results disclosure app. Included in the notification was a link to TellYourContacts.org and a message encouraging the COVID-19 positive patient to utilize the website to alert their close contact of exposure risk. Over the course of three months, from May 18th, 2020 to August 17th, 2020, we utilized Google Analytics and Microsoft Excel to record data on the quantity of website users and message senders, types of messages sent, and geographic distribution of the senders. RESULTS: Over the course of three months, 9,130 users accessed the website. Of the users, 1,474 unique senders sent a total of 1,957 messages. Of those messages, users sent 1,820 (93%) SMS messages and 137 (7%) emails. Users sent messages from 40 states, with the majority of United States senders from California (49%). CONCLUSIONS: We set out to determine if individuals who test positive for COVID-19 will utilize the TellYourContacts.org website to notify their close contacts of COVID-19 exposure risk. Our findings reveal that, during the observation period, each unique sender sent an average of 1.33 messages. TellYourContacts.org offers an additional method that individuals can and will use to notify their close contacts.","Okpara, Kelechi Stephanie; Hecht, Jennifer; Wohlfeiler, Daniel; Prior, Matthew; Klausner, Jeffrey",,867,16

CC commonly observed include myocarditis/myocardial injury, arrhythmias and heart failure, with an incidence reaching about a quarter of hospitalized patients in some reports. The increased incidence of CC raise questions about the possible heightened susceptibility of patients with cardiac disease to develop severe COVID-19, and whether the virus itself is involved in the pathogenesis of CC. The wide array of CC seems to stem from multiple mechanisms, including the ability of the virus to directly enter cardiomyocytes, and to indirectly damage the heart through systemic hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable states, endothelial injury of the coronary arteries and hypoxemia. The induced CC seem to dramatically impact the prognosis of COVID-19, with some studies suggesting over 50% mortality rates with myocardial damage, up from ~ 5% overall mortality of COVID-19 alone. Thus, it is particularly important to investigate the relation between COVID-19 and heart disease, given the major effect on morbidity and mortality, aiming at early detection and improving patient care and outcomes. In this article, we review the growing body of published data on the topic to provide the reader with a comprehensive and robust description of the available evidence and its implication for clinical practice.","Ramadan, Mohammad Said; Bertolino, Lorenzo; Marrazzo, Tommaso; Florio, Maria Teresa; Durante-Mangoni, Emanuele",Intern. emerg. med,867,16

Methods: We developed three models during the epidemic: a discrete model to predict the maximum burden on the health system in a short time framea basic SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-removed) model with discrete equations; a stochastic SEIR model with the Monte Carlo method; and a Gompertz-type model for metropolitan city of Santiago. Results: The maximum potential burden model has been useful throughout the monitoring of the epidemic, providing an upper bound for the number of cases, intensive care unit occupancy, and deaths. Deterministic and stochastic SEIR models were very useful in predicting the rise of cases and the peak and onset of case decline; however, they lost utility in the current situation due to the asynchronous recruitment of cases in the regions and the persistence of a strong endemic. The Gompertz model had a better fit in the decline since it best captures the epidemic curves asymmetry in Santiago. Conclusions: The models have shown great utility in monitoring the epidemic in Chile, with different objectives in different epidemic stages. They have complemented empirical indicators such as reported cases, fatality, deaths, and others, making it possible to predict situations of interest and visualization of the short and long-term local behavior of this pandemic.","Canals, Mauricio; Cuadrado, Cristóbal; Canals, Andrea",Medwave,867,1

However, the detection rate of AF is low after ischemic stroke. Developing a prediction model for newly diagnosed AF after ischemic stroke will help to assess the subclinical AF.We identified 98,103 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and 261,893 patients without DM, who were not AF history and admitted for newly ischemic stroke from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. The prediction model for 3-year incidence of AF after ischemic stroke was derived from multivariate logistic regression and also the accuracy rate of the prediction model was compared with CHA2DS2-VASC and CHADS2 scores as a reference.Four thousand nine hundred seventy six patients in the DM cohort and 16,127 patients in the non-DM cohort developed AF during 3 years of follow-up. The variables in the point-based prediction model for non-DM patients (range: -3-28), included age, heart failure, coronary artery disease, gout, obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, female, and statin use, while those for DM patients (range: -2-30) included age, heart failure, coronary artery disease, chronic kidney disease, hypertension, obstructive pulmonary disease, and statin use. Compared to the CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scoring systems, this scoring system was better at predicting 3-year risk of AF after ischemic stroke in both cohorts.This model might be useful in evaluating the benefit of insertable cardiac monitor implantation and anticoagulation agents in individual patients after ischemic stroke.","Chen, Yung-Lung; Wang, Hui-Ting; Chen, Huang-Chung; Liu, Wen-Hao; Hsueh, Shukai; Chung, Wen-Jung; Wu, Po-Jui; Liu, Chi-Hung; Chung, Chang-Ming; Lin, Yu-Sheng",Medicine (Baltimore),867,24

The key to the Korean government's success in combating COVID-19 lies with the latest digital technologies (DTs). The prompt and effective application of DTs facilitates both containment as well as mitigation strategies and their sub-policy measures. Methods: This article uses an experiential analysis based on an exploratory case study - analysis on field applications of the government's interventions. Information is collected by qualitative methods such as literature analysis, meeting materials, and a review of various government reports (including internal ones) along with academic and professional experiences of the authors. Findings: The article presents the unique Korean health policy approaches in the COVID-19 crisis. First, DTs allow the Korean government to embrace various policy measures together listed in containment strategy, namely altering and warning, epidemiological investigation, quarantine of contacts, case-finding, social distancing, and mask-wearing. Second, DTs allow Korea to integrate containment and mitigation strategies simultaneously. Along with the above measures in containment, healthcare service, medical treatment, and prophylaxis (presymptomatic testing) within mitigation are utilized to prevent a COVID-19 spread. Conclusions: Korea develops DTs in an integrated manner in the early pandemic stage under strong and coordinated government leadership. Above all, the DTs' functions in each pandemic developmental stage are continuously upgraded. Instead of prioritizing policy measures or strategies, therefore, Korea can implement diverse policies simultaneously by integrating DTs effectively. During the COVID-19 outbreak, DTs work as the enablers to connect these two strategies and their measures in Korea. Recommendations: DTs should be at the center of the disaster management paradigm, especially during a pandemic. DTs are facilitators and integrators of containing and mitigating strategies and their policy measures.","Heo, Kyungmoo; Lee, Daejoong; Seo, Yongseok; Choi, Hyeseung",Ann Glob Health,867,1

After hospitalization for COVID-19, a number of patients are referred to medical rehabilitation centers or skilled nursing facilities for further treatment, while others go home with or without aftercare. The aftercare paths include 1] community-based rehabilitation; 2] in- and outpatient medical rehabilitation; 3] inpatient rehabilitation in skilled nursing facilities; and 4] sheltered care (inpatient). These aftercare paths and the trajectories of recovery after COVID-19 urgently need long-term in-depth evaluation to optimize and personalize treatment. CO-FLOW aims, by following the outcomes and aftercare paths of all COVID-19 patients after hospital discharge, to systematically study over a 2-year period: 1] trajectories of physical, cognitive, and psychological recovery; 2] patient flows, healthcare utilization, patient satisfaction with aftercare, and barriers/facilitators regarding aftercare as experienced by healthcare professionals; 3] effects of physical, cognitive, and psychological outcomes on participation and HRQoL; and 4] predictors for long-term recovery, health care utilization, and patient satisfaction with aftercare. METHODS: CO-FLOW is a multicenter prospective cohort study in the mid-west of the Netherlands with a 2-year follow-up period. Measurements comprise non-invasive clinical tests and patient reported outcome measures from a combined rehabilitation, pulmonary, and intensive care perspective. Measurements are performed at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after hospital discharge and, if applicable, at rehabilitation discharge. CO-FLOW aims to include at least 500 patients who survived hospitalization for COVID-19, aged &#8805;18 years. DISCUSSION: CO-FLOW will provide in-depth knowledge on the long-term sequelae of COVID-19 and the quality of current aftercare paths for patients who survived hospitalization. This knowledge is a prerequisite to facilitate the right care in the right place for COVID-19 and comparable future infectious diseases.

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, Global Health, the WHO COVID-19 database, Google Scholar, DisasterLit, and preprint servers from inception to April 8, 2020. Citation screening was conducted independently in duplicate. Outcomes of interest included mask performance (i.e. filtration efficiency, airflow resistance) and germicidal effects following decontamination. RESULTS: Of 1874 unique citations, 33 full-texts were assessed of which 7 studies were included. One study evaluated mask performance with interventions applied after mask use: dry heat (via rice cooker), autoclave, and three chemical agents (70% ethanol, 100% isopropanol, and 0.5% sodium hypochlorite). Six studies evaluated interventions applied prior to mask use to enhance antimicrobial properties and/or mask performance: nanoparticle emulsions, quaternary ammonium agent, N-halamine, salt film, and a fluorochemical repellent. Heterogeneity of interventions evaluated and outcomes assessed precluded quantitative analysis. Mask performance was best preserved with dry heat decontamination. Good germicidal effects were observed in salt-, N-halamine-, and nanoparticle-coated masks. Safety outcomes were infrequently evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Limited evidence exists on the safety or efficacy of surgical mask decontamination interventions. Studies to date have evaluated interventions and outcomes using heterogenous and non-standardized test conditions, limiting our ability to compare between interventions or draw conclusions on the most efficacious intervention.","Zorko, D.; Gertsman, S.; O039,; Hearn, K.; Timmerman, N.; Ambu-Ali, N.; Dinh, T.; Sampson, M.; Sikora, L.; McNally, J.

The area under the curve (AUC) and odds ratio values obtained by DAR to predict in-hospital mortality were higher than the values obtained by the all other parameters (AUC of DAR, albumin, D-dimer, FAR and fibrinogen: 0.773, 0.766, 0.757, 0.703 and 0.637, respectively; odds ratio of DAR > 56.36, albumin < 4.015, D-dimer > 292.5, FAR > 112.33 and fibrinogen > 423:7.898, 6.216, 6.058, 4.437 and 2.794, respectively). In addition; patients with concurrent DAR > 56.36 and FAR > 112.33 had an odds ratio of 21.879 with respect to patients with concurrent DAR < 56.36 and FAR < 112.33. CONCLUSION: DAR may be used as a new marker to predict mortality in COVID-19 patients. In addition, the concurrent high DARs and FARs were found to be more valuable in predicting in-hospital mortality than either separately.","Küçükceran, Kadir; Ayranci, Mustafa Kürsat; Girisgin, Abdullah Sadik; Koçak, Sedat",Int J Clin Pract,867,13

We investigated whether the D-dimer/albumin ratio (DAR) and fibrinogen/albumin ratio (FAR) predict mortality in the COVID-19 patients. METHODS: A total of 717 COVID-19 patients who were brought to the emergency department from March to October 2020 were included in the study. Levels of D-dimer, fibrinogen and albumin, as well as DAR, FAR, age, gender and in-hospital mortality status of the patients, were recorded. The patients were grouped by in-hospital mortality. Statistical comparison was conducted between the groups. RESULTS: Of the patients included in the study, 371 (51.7%) were male, and their median age was 64 years (50-74).

Appropriate chemoprophylaxis choices are essential to prevent some of these adverse events and from exacerbating others. Risk stratification to prescribe safe and effective medications in the prevention of postoperative VTE has shown benefit in this regard. The Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Syosset Hospital/Northwell Health, which performs over 1200 arthroplasties annually, has validated and is using the 2013 version of the Caprini Risk Assessment Model (RAM) to stratify each patient for risk of postoperative VTE. This tool results in a culling of information, past and present, personal and familial, that provides a truly thorough evaluation of the patient's risk for postoperative VTE. The Caprini score then guides the medication choices for thromboprophylaxis. The Caprini score is only valuable if the data is properly collected, and we have learned numerous lessons after applying it for 18 months. Risk stratification requires practice and experience to achieve expertise in perioperative patient evaluation. Having access to pertinent patient information, while gaining proficiency in completing the Caprini RAM, is vital to its efficacy. Ongoing, real time analyses of patient outcomes, with subsequent change in process, is key to improving patient care.","Krauss, Eugene S; Cronin, MaryAnne; Dengler, Nancy; Simonson, Barry G; Enker, Paul; Segal, Ayal",Clin Appl Thromb Hemost,867,20

Several control strategies have been proposed; however, the global efficacy of local measures implemented at the ward level may depend on hospital-level organizational factors. We aimed at better understanding the role of between-ward interactions on nosocomial outbreaks and their control in a multiward psychiatric hospital in Western France. We built a stochastic compartmental transmission model of SARS-CoV-2 in the 24-wards hospital, accounting for the various infection states among patients and staff, and between-ward connections resulting from staff sharing. We first evaluated the potential of hospital-wide diffusion of local outbreaks, depending on the ward they started in. We then assessed control strategies, including a screening area upon patient admission, an isolation ward for COVID-19 positive patients and changes in staff schedules to limit between-ward mixing. Much larger and more frequent outbreaks occurred when the index case originated in one of the most connected wards with up to four times more transmissions when compared to the more isolated ones. The number of wards where infection spreads was brought down by up to 53 % after reducing staff sharing. Finally, we found that setting up an isolation ward reduced the number of transmissions by up to 70 %, while adding a screening area before admission seemed ineffective. Significance StatementHospital acquired COVID-19 poses a major problem to many countries. Despite extensive protective measures, transmission within hospitals still occurs regularly and threatens those essential to the fight against the pandemic while putting patients at risk. Using a stochastic compartmental model, we simulate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a multi-ward hospital, assessing the effect of different scenarios and infection control strategies. The novelty of our method resides in the consideration of staff sharing data to better reflect the field reality. Our results highlight the poor efficiency of implementing a screening area before hospital admission, while the setting up of an isolation ward dedicated to COVID-19 patients and the restriction of healthcare workers movements between wards significantly reduce epidemic spread.","Oodally, Ajmal; Hammami, Pachka; Reilhac, Astrid; Lamérie, Guillaume Guérineau de; Opatowski, Lulla; Temime, Laura",,867,16

METHODS: Participants were 2233 college students with an average age of 19.34 (SD = 1.07) recruited from southern China using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and hierarchical multiple regression. They completed the college student physical activity questionnaire, regulatory emotional self-efficacy scale (RES) and Symptom Checklist (SCL-90) to explore the internal mechanism of the relationship between home exercises and mental health in the context of fitness campaign. RESULTS: Statistical analysis based on ANOVA and hierarchical multiple regression, and the results showed that gender differences is a critical factor influencing the effectiveness of home exercise on mental health in college students. Furthermore, individuals with regulatory emotional self-efficacy are more likely to keep exercising, which may stimulate the positive effect on enhancing mental health. CONCLUSION: Variable of emotion regulation efficacy play an important role in promoting college students positive emotions, stimulating potential, and improving physical and mental health.

Since fairness is a concept of justice which comes in various, sometimes conflicting definitions, this is not a trivial task though. The most appropriate fairness definition for an artificial intelligence (AI) system is a matter of ethical standards and legal requirements, and the right choice depends on the particular use case and its context. In this position paper, we propose to use a decision tree as means to explain and justify the implemented kind of fairness to the end users. Such a structure would first of all support AI practitioners in mapping ethical principles to fairness definitions for a concrete application and therefore make the selection a straightforward and transparent process. However, this approach would also help document the reasoning behind the decision making. Due to the general complexity of the topic of fairness in AI, we argue that specifying""fairness""for a given use case is the best way forward to maintain confidence in AI systems. In this case, this could be achieved by sharing the reasons and principles expressed during the decision making process with the broader audience.","Ruf, Boris; Detyniecki, Marcin",,867,14

Previous studies have reported pandemic-related anxiety. Anxiety disorder and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are common comorbidities. However, there has been no report of any patient with undiagnosed ASD who developed anxiety disorders caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. In this case report, we describe an 8-year-old Japanese boy with undiagnosed ASD who developed COVID-19 phobia, resulting in avoidant restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID). PATIENT CONCERNS: As COVID-19 was highly publicized in the mass media and the risk of droplet infection was emphasized upon, the patient began to fear viral contamination from food, culminating in a refusal to eat or even swallow his saliva. He was admitted to a pediatric medical center in Osaka with life-threatening dehydration and was then referred to our child psychiatry department. DIAGNOSIS: We diagnosed the patient with COVID-19 phobia resulting in ARFID. We identified ASD traits from his present social communication skills and developmental history. INTERVENTIONS: We provided psychoeducation of ASD for the parents and administered supportive psychotherapy. OUTCOMES: Shortly after our intervention to relieve his ASD-related anxiety, his dysphagia improved. LESSONS: Our findings suggest that children with undiagnosed ASD may develop COVID-19 phobia. In these cases, intervention for ASD may be more appropriate than starting treatment for anxiety disorders as the first-line option. COVID-19 is the biggest pandemic in the recent past, and more undiagnosed ASD patients who develop COVID-19 phobia may seek treatment. Clinicians should consider the underlying ASD in these patients and assess their developmental history and present social communication skills.","Sakamoto, Shoko; Miyawaki, Dai; Goto, Ayako; Harima, Yuji; Tokuhara, Daisuke; Inoue, Koki",Medicine (Baltimore),867,18

All families with at least one parent and one child below the age of 20 who lived at the same address (N = 662,582), where at least one member, i.e. the index case, tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 2020, were included. Secondary attack rates (SAR7) were defined as the share of non-index family members with a positive PCR test within 7 days after the date when the index case tested positive. SARs were calculated separately for parent- and child-index cases, and for parent- and child-secondary cases. We identified 7548 families with an index case, comprising 26,991 individuals (12,184 parents, 14,808 children). The index was a parent in 66% of the cases. Among index children, 42% were in the age group 17-20 and only 8% in the age group 0-6. When the index was a parent, SAR7 was 24% (95% CI 24-25), whilst SAR7 was 14% (95% CI 13-15) when the index was a child. However, SAR7 was 24% (95% CI 20-28) when the index was a child aged 0-6 years and declined with increasing age of the index child. SAR7 from index parent to other parent was 35% (95% CI 33-36), and from index child to other children 12% (95% CI 11-13). SAR7 from index child aged 0-6 to parents was 27% (95% CI 22-33). The percent of non-index family members tested within 7 days after the index case, increased from about 20% in April to 80% in December, however, SAR7 stabilized at about 20% from May. We conclude that parents and older children are most often index cases for SARS-CoV-2 in families in Norway, while parents and young children more often transmit the virus within the family. This study suggests that whilst the absolute infection numbers are low for young children because of their low introduction rate, when infected, young children and parents transmit the virus to the same extent within the family.","Telle, Kjetil; Jørgensen, Silje B; Hart, Rannveig; Greve-Isdahl, Margrethe; Kacelnik, Oliver",Eur. j. epidemiol,867,15

METHODS: This project has a quasi-experimental research design, based on a pilot study of 14 subjects aged above 65 years. They received eight sessions of singing group therapy given by a social robot or an occupational therapist. Completed copies of a therapeutic-factor questionnaire were then collected. RESULTS: At the 4th week, the scores for 8 therapeutic factors were higher in sessions with the occupational therapist than the robot-directed sessions, reaching a statistically significant level; at the 8th week, the scores for 3 therapeutic factors, including imparting of information, were higher in sessions with the occupational therapist than in sessions with the robot. The top scoring therapeutic factor in the robot sessions was group cohesiveness. CONCLUSIONS: Social robots may be good companion tools for elderly care during this COVID-19 outbreak, but group therapy sessions supervised by real-person therapists still have higher therapeutic factor scores than those conducted by robots.

In multivariate logistic regression analysis, low educational status, treatment type, following COVID-19 news, having knowledge about COVID-19 transmission and higher C19P-S score were associated with noncompliance (p = 0.006, p < 0.001, p = 0.002, p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively). Multivariate analysis revealed that having knowledge about COVID-19 transmission was related to a higher C19P-S score (p = 0.001). The cancer patients studied had significant coronaphobia.

We also investigate the impact of environmental cleaning and disinfection, and government-imposed isolation of infected individuals. We use a Bayesian approach and officially published data to estimate some of the model parameters, including the basic reproduction number. Our findings suggest that social distancing and quarantine are the winning strategies to reduce the impact of the outbreak. Environmental cleaning can also be relevant, but its cost and effort required to bring the maximum of the outbreak under control indicate that its cost-efficacy is low.","Saldaña, Fernando; Flores-Arguedas, Hugo; Camacho-Gutiérrez, José Ariel; Barradas, Ignacio",Math Biosci Eng,867,16

The LAMP results of these children showed a sensitivity and specificity of 63.6% and 100%, respectively, that was relative to the RT-PCR results. LAMP tests using nasopharyngeal swab (NPS) and RT-PCR were almost consistent throughout hospitalization in the school children, except in the very early stage of infection.

During the next days the kidney function improved and liver function started to recover. Four days after admission, the patient was transferred to the psychiatric ward. Urine, serum, plasma and whole-blood samples were analyzed for ricinine using a quantitative LC-MS-MS method. Initial values on admission (serum and urine) were very high in comparison with previously reported cases. Based on these values, the patient was monitored closely in the following days. The patient made a full recovery and during the course of hospitalization, concentrations of ricinine in plasma/serum, blood and urine gradually declined. The presence of ricinine in a patient's blood or plasma is proof of castor bean, hence, ricin exposure. However, based on this case and previous reported cases in literature, we can conclude that no clear correlation can be established between ricinine blood, plasma or urine levels and the severity of the intoxication.

MethodsIn line with recent recommendations, a third dose of either heterologous ChAdOx1 (AstraZeneca) or homologous BNT162b2 (BioNTech) was administered to 25 kidney transplant recipients (KTR) without humoral response after 2 doses of BNT162b2, followed by analysis of serological responses and vaccine-specific B- and T-cell immunity. Results9/25 (36%) KTR under standard immunosuppressive treatment seroconverted until day 27 after the third vaccination, while one patient developed severe COVID-19 infection immediately after vaccination. Cellular analysis seven days after the third dose showed significantly elevated frequencies of viral spike protein receptor binding domain specific B cells in humoral responders as compared to non-responders. Likewise, portions of spike-reactive CD4+ T helper cells were significantly elevated in seroconverting patients. Furthermore, overall frequencies of IL-2+, IL-4+ and polyfunctional CD4+ T cells significantly increased after the third dose, whereas memory/effector differentiation remained unaffected. ConclusionsOur data suggest that a fraction of transplant recipients benefits from triple vaccination, where seroconversion is associated with quantitative and qualitative changes of cellular immunity. At the same time, the study highlights that modified vaccination approaches for immunosuppressed patients still remain an urgent medical need. Significance statementProtection of solid organ transplant recipients against SARS-Cov-2 by vaccination remains an unmet need given the low immunogenicity of available vaccines in the presence of immunosuppression. Administration of a third dose to 25 kidney transplant recipients (KTR) resulted in seroconversion in 36% of patients, associated with significant quantitative and functional changes within the spike-antigen-specific B-cell- and CD4+ T-helper cell compartment. Our data support the need for individual humoral monitoring of immunosuppressed individuals after vaccination as well as continued efforts to adapt vaccination protocols for this at-risk group.","Schrezenmeier, Eva; Rincon-Arevalo, Hector; Stefanski, Ana-Luisa; Potekhin, Alexander; Staub-Hohenbleicher, Henriette; Choi, Mira; Bachmann, Friederike; Pross, Vanessa; Hammett, Charlotte; Schrezenmeier, Hubert; Ludwig, Carolin; Jahrsdoerfer, Bernd; Lino, Andreia C; Eckardt, Kai-Uwe; Kotsch, Katja; Doerner, Thomas; Budde, Klemens; Sattler, Arne; Halleck, Fabian",,867,21

Previous studies have demonstrated that SARS-COV-2 (Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) infecting host cells mainly rely on binding to receptor proteins, namely ACE2 and TMPRSS2. COVID-19 transmission is faster than the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pneumonia outbreak in 2002. This is mainly attributed to the different pathways of virus-infected host cells, coupled with patients' atypical clinical characteristics. SARS-CoV-2 is mainly transmitted through respiratory droplets and contact, infecting lung tissues before damaging other body organs, such as the liver, brain, kidney and heart. The present study identified potential target genes for SARS-COV-2 receptors, ACE2 and TMPRSS2, in normal human lung tissue.

Fear and concerns of catastrophic outcomes of the epidemic in Yemen were immediately raised, as the country is facing a complex humanitarian crisis. The purpose of this report is to describe the epidemiological situation in Yemen during the first 2 months of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. METHODS: We analyzed the epidemiological data from 18 February to 05 June 2020, including the 2 months before the confirmation of the first case. We included in our analysis the data from 10 out of 23 governorates of Yemen, located in southern and eastern part of the country. RESULTS: A total of 469 laboratory confirmed, 552 probable and 55 suspected cases with onset of symptoms between 18 February and 5 June 2020 were reported through the surveillance system. The median age among confirmed cases was 46 years (range: 1-90 years), and 75% of the confirmed cases were male. A total of 111 deaths were reported among those with confirmed infection. The mean age among those who died was 53 years (range: 14-88 years), with 63% of deaths (n = 70) occurring in individuals under the age 60 years. A total of 268 individuals with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were hospitalized (57%), among whom there were 95 in-hospital deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The surveillance strategy implemented in the first 2 months of the SARS CoV 2 in the southern and eastern governorates of Yemen, captured mainly severe cases. The mild and moderate cases were not self-reported to the health facilities and surveillance system due to limited resources, stigma, and other barriers. The mortality appeared to be higher in individuals aged under 60 years, and most fatalities occurred in individuals who were in critical condition when they reached the health facilities. It is unclear whether the presence of other acute comorbidities contributed to the high death rate among SARS-CoV-2 cases. The findings only include the southern and eastern part of the country, which is home to 31% of the total population of Yemen, as the data from the northern part of the country was inaccessible for analysis. This makes our results not generalizable to the rest of the country.","Al-Waleedi, Ali Ahmed; Naiene, Jeremias D; Thabet, Ahmed A K; Dandarawe, Adham; Salem, Hanan; Mohammed, Nagat; Al Noban, Maysa; Bin-Azoon, Nasreen Salem; Shawqi, Ammar; Rajamanar, Mohammed; Al-Jariri, Riyadh; Al Hyubaishi, Mansoor; Khanbari, Lina; Thabit, Najib; Obaid, Basel; Baaees, Manal; Assaf, Denise; Senga, Mikiko; Bashir, Ismail Mahat; Mahmoud, Nuha; Cosico, Roy; Smith, Philip; Musani, Altaf",PLoS One,867,16

Evidence is growing for a role of AL in viral infection. AL have been observed early in the life cycles of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and, more recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), suggesting a specific induction of mechanisms potentially useful to these pathogens. Like other positive-strand RNA viruses, these viruses induce host cells membranes rearrangements. The NPCs of AL could potentially mediate exchanges between these partially sealed compartments and the cytoplasm. AL may also be involved in regulating Ca2+ homeostasis or cell cycle control. They were recently observed in cells infected with Theileria annulata, an intracellular protozoan parasite inducing cell proliferation. Further studies are required to clarify their role in intracellular pathogen/host-cell interactions.","Eymieux, Sébastien; Blanchard, Emmanuelle; Uzbekov, Rustem; Hourioux, Christophe; Roingeard, Philippe",Cell Microbiol,867,16

Assessing the effectiveness of China's current policies on imported cases abroad is very important for China and other countries that are facing or will face overseas imported cases. In April, we used a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model to simulate the epidemic in seven foreign countries, China and the three Chinese key cities. Based on the model outside China, we estimated the proportion of people in incubation period and calculated the risk indexes for Chinese cities through analyzing aviation traffic data from these countries. Based on the model in China and the three key cities, we collected information on control measures and quantified the effectiveness of implementing the current policies at different times and intensities. Our model results showed that Shanghai, Beijing, Qingdao, Guangzhou, and Tianjin have the top five risk indexes. As of April 20, 2020, under current measures, the number of confirmed cases could be reduced by 99% compared with no air traffic restrictions and isolation measures; the reduction could be 93% with isolation of passengers only from key countries. If the current policy were postponed for 7, 10, or 20 days, the increase in the number of confirmed cases would be 1,329, 5,524, and 779,245 respectively, which is 2.1, 5.7, and 662.9 times the number of confirmed cases under current measures. Our research indicates that the importation control measures currently taken by China were implemented at an appropriate time to prevent the epidemic spreading and have achieved relatively good control results.

Methods: In this paper, we present our argument regarding the efficiency and applicability of existing deep learning models for COVID-19 diagnosis. We provide results from two popular models - COVID-Net and CoroNet evaluated on three publicly available datasets and an additional institutional dataset collected from EMORY Hospital between January and May 2020, containing patients tested for COVID-19 infection using RT-PCR. Results: There is a large false positive rate (FPR) for COVID-Net on both ChexPert (55.3%) and MIMIC-CXR (23.4%) dataset. On the EMORY Dataset, COVID-Net has 61.4% sensitivity, 0.54 F1-score and 0.49 precision value. The FPR of the CoroNet model is significantly lower across all the datasets as compared to COVID-Net - EMORY(9.1%), ChexPert (1.3%), ChestX-ray14 (0.02%), MIMIC-CXR (0.06%). Conclusion: The models reported good to excellent performance on their internal datasets, however we observed from our testing that their performance dramatically worsened on external data. This is likely from several causes including overfitting models due to lack of appropriate control patients and ground truth labels. The fourth institutional dataset was labeled using RT-PCR, which could be positive without radiographic findings and vice versa. Therefore, a fusion model of both clinical and radiographic data may have better performance and generalization.","Banerjee, Imon; Sinha, Priyanshu; Purkayastha, Saptarshi; Mashhaditafreshi, Nazanin; Tariq, Amara; Jeong, Jiwoong; Trivedi, Hari; Gichoya, Judy W.",,867,21

But in this debate it is seldom recognized that the health shock is not entirely exogenous. Its magnitude and dynamics themselves depend on economic policies, and the explicit or implicit incentives those policies provide. To illuminate the feedback loops between medical and economic factors we develop a minimal economic model of pandemics. In the model, as in reality, individual decisions to comply (or not) with virus-related public health directives depend on economic variables and incentives, which themselves respond to current economic policy and expectations of future policies. The analysis yields several practical lessons: because policies affect the speed of virus transmission via incentives, public health measures and economic policies can complement each other, reducing the cost of attaining desired social goals;expectations of expansionary macroeconomic policies during the recovery phase can help reduce the speed of infection, and hence the size of the health shock;the credibility of announced policies is key to rule out both self-fulfilling pessimistic expectations and time inconsistency problems.

The current preregistered study examined purpose in life as a psychological resource that may buffer against loneliness and increase intentions to engage in health protective behaviors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, 517 adults (mean=37.71, SD=11.30; range=19-73) reported their levels of purpose in life, current and pre-pandemic levels of loneliness, and degrees to which they intended to engage in behaviors known to prevent the spread of COVID-19. RESULTS: Across age, having a stronger sense of purpose in life was associated with lower loneliness, as well as greater intentions to engage in COVID protective behaviors. Higher loneliness was associated with lower intentions to maintain social distance and engage in additional health promotion behaviors such as handwashing. However, this link was not present at higher levels of purpose in life. Older age was also associated with less loneliness, but not for individuals with lower levels of purpose in life. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Results suggest that psychological resources such as purpose in life are associated with increased protective health behaviors. Further, purpose in life may reduce loneliness and counteract negative effects of stressors that diminish the willingness to engage in health protective behaviors. Our data also highlight resilience among older individuals in times of isolation during a global pandemic.","Kang, Yoona; Cosme, Danielle; Pei, Rui; Pandey, Prateekshit; Carreras-Tartak, José; Falk, Emily B",GerontologistGerontologist,867,1

RASi patients were older, more frequently male, with more comorbidities and frailer. Their probability of death and ICU admission was higher. However, after adjustment, these differences disappeared. Regarding RASi in-hospital use, those who continued the treatment were younger, with balanced comorbidities but with less severe COVID19.

After adjustment, patients receiving RASi still presented significantly better outcomes, with less mortality, ICU admissions, respiratory insufficiency, need for mechanical ventilation or prone, sepsis, SIRS and renal failure (p<0.05 for all). However, we did not find differences regarding the hospital use of RASi and the development of heart failure. CONCLUSION: RASi historic use, at admission, is not related to an adjusted worse prognosis in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, although it points out a high-risk population. In this setting, the in-hospital prescription of RASi is associated with improved survival and fewer short-term complications.","Núñez-Gil, Iván J; Olier, Iván; Feltes, Gisela; Viana-Llamas, María C; Maroun-Eid, Charbel; Romero, Rodolfo; Fernández-Rozas, Inmaculada; Uribarri, Aitor; Becerra-Muñoz, Victor M; Alfonso-Rodriguez, Emilio; García-Aguado, Marcos; Elola, Javier; Castro-Mejía, Alex; Pepe, Martino; Garcia-Prieto, Juan Fortunato; Gonzalez, Adelina; Ugo, Fabrizio; Cerrato, Enrico; Bondia, Elvira; Raposeiras-Roubin, Sergio; Mendez, Jorge L Jativa; Espejo, Carolina; López-Masjuan, Álvaro; Marin, Francisco; López-Pais, Javier; Abumayyaleh, Mohammad; Corbi-Pascual, Miguel; Liebetrau, Christoph; Ramakrishna, Harish; Estrada, Vicente; Macaya, Carlos; Fernandez-Ortiz, Antonio",Am Heart J,867,13

Some animal viral infections spread sporadically to human populations, posing a serious health risk. Particularly the emerging viral zoonotic diseases such as the novel, zoonotic coronavirus represent an actual challenge for the scientific and medical community. Besides human health risks, some animal viral infections, although still not zoonotic, represent important economic loses to the livestock industry. Viral infections pose a genuine concern for which there has been an increasing interest for new antiviral molecules. Among these novel compounds, antiviral peptides have been proposed as promising therapeutic options, not only for the growing body of evidence showing hopeful results but also due to the many adverse effects of chemical-based drugs. Here we review the current progress, key targets and considerations for the development of antiviral peptides (AVPs). The review summarizes the state of the art of the AVPs tested in zoonotic (coronaviruses, Rift Valley fever viruses, Eastern Equine Encephalitis Virus, Dengue and Junín virus) and also non-zoonotic farm animal viruses (avian and cattle viruses). Their molecular target, amino acid sequence and mechanism of action are summarized and reviewed. Antiviral peptides are currently on the cutting edge since they have been reported to display anti-coronavirus activity. Particularly, the review will discuss the specific mode of action of AVPs that specifically inhibit the fusion of viral and host-cell membranes for SARS-CoV-2, showing in detail some important features of the fusion inhibiting peptides that target the spike protein of these risky viruses.","Hollmann, Axel; Cardoso, Nancy P; Espeche, Juan C; Maffía, Paulo C",Peptides,867,1

Accordingly, our objective was to evaluate the association between scores from an array of cognitive function tests and self-reported vaccine hesitancy after the announcement of the successful testing of the first COVID-19 vaccine (Oxford University/AstraZeneca). METHODS: We used individual-level data from a pandemic-focused study ('COVID Survey'), a prospective cohort study nested within United Kingdom Understanding Society ('Main Survey'). In the week immediately following the announcement of successful testing of the first efficacious inoculation (November/December 2020), data on vaccine intentionality were collected in 11,740 individuals (6702 women) aged 16-95 years. Pre-pandemic scores on general cognitive function, ascertained from a battery of six tests, were captured in 2011/12 wave of the Main Survey. Study members self-reported their intention to take up a vaccination in the COVID-19 Survey. RESULTS: Of the study sample, 17.2% (N = 1842) indicated they were hesitant about having the vaccine. After adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, study members with a lower baseline cognition score were markedly more likely to be vaccine hesitant (odds ratio per standard deviation lower score in cognition; 95% confidence interval: 1.76; 1.62, 1.90). Adjustment for mental and physical health plus household shielding status had no impact on these results, whereas controlling for educational attainment led to partial attenuation but the probability of hesitancy was still elevated (1.52; 1.37, 1.67). There was a linear association for vaccine hesitancy across the full range of cognition scores (p for trend: p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Erroneous social media reports might have complicated personal decision-making, leading to people with lower cognitive ability being vaccine-hesitant. With individuals with lower cognition also experiencing higher rates of COVID-19 in studies conducted prior to vaccine distribution, these new findings are suggestive of a potential additional disease burden.","Batty, G David; Deary, Ian J; Fawns-Ritchie, Chloe; Gale, Catharine R; Altschul, Drew",Brain behav. immun,867,1

Biochemical markers may help with management and prognostication of COVID-19 patients; however, their utility is still under investigation. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted to evaluate alanine aminotransferase, C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate, and high sensitivity troponin T (TnT) levels in 67 patients who were admitted to a Canadian tertiary care centre for management of COVID-19. Logistic, cause-specific Cox proportional-hazards, and accelerated failure time regression modelling were performed to assess the associations of initial analyte concentrations with in-hospital death and length of stay in hospital; joint modelling was performed to assess the associations of the concentrations over the course of the hospital stay with in-hospital death. RESULTS: Initial TnT and CRP concentrations were associated with length of stay in hospital. Eighteen patients died (27%), and the median initial TnT concentration was higher in patients who died (55 ng/L) than those who lived (16 ng/L; P < 0.0001). There were no survivors with an initial TnT concentration > 64 ng/L. While the initial TnT concentration was predictive of death, later measurements were not. Only CRP had prognostic value with both the initial and subsequent measurements: a 20% increase in the initial CRP concentration was associated with a 14% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1-29%) increase in the odds of death, and the hazard of death increased 14% (95% CI: 5-25%) for each 20% increase in the current CRP value. While the initial lactate concentration was not predictive of death, subsequent measurements were. CONCLUSION: CRP, lactate and TnT were associated with poorer outcomes and appear to be useful biochemical markers for monitoring COVID-19 patients.","Rutledge, Angela C; Choi, Yun-Hee; Karp, Igor; Bhayana, Vipin; Stevic, Ivan",Clin. biochem,867,5

However, less is known about the use of telemedicine in sports and exercise medicine (teleSEM) and its utility to treat emergent craniofacial injuries. Given how common facial trauma is among athletes and its possible complications, incorporation of telemedicine in sports-related injuries may prove to be quintessential for athletes and coaches. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of the MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted for studies published through December 2020 with multiple search terms related to telemedicine in sports and trauma care. RESULTS: Overall, teleSEM is appreciated by both patients and physicians alike. Studies show that the satisfaction rate among patients and physicians are high. Sports-related telemedicine visits can help improve resource utilization and total costs. Facial trauma studies also reveal that the level of concurrency of treatment options between telemedicine visits and in-person consultations is almost perfect. Further, there are many additional ways that teleSEM can be implemented in treating injured athletes, including possible collaboration between athletic coaches and physicians as well as mobile device applications. Telemedicine may be particularly useful in treating acute injuries in low-resourced areas with limited equipment and training. CONCLUSION: Telemedicine has been widely employed for sports-related injuries and in traumatic care. Patients and providers alike have noted its utility over other methods of communication with physicians. Our findings suggest that telemedicine has a significant potential in treating sports-related injuries and improving the efficiency of diagnoses and treatments. It may enhance outcomes for participants in athletic events. This may become a key aspect of determining whether a player can return to immediate competition.","Tam, Anson; Plotsker, Ethan; Kim, Minji; Thaller, Seth R",J. craniofac. surg,867,1

To examine the link between these concepts, we propose an econophysics asset exchange model with the surplus stock of the wealthy. The wealthy are one of the two exchange agents and have more assets than the poor. Our simulation model converts the surplus contribution rate of the wealthy to a new variable parameter alongside the saving rate and introduces the total exchange (flow) and rank correlation coefficient (metabolism) as new evaluation indexes, adding to the Gini index (disparities), thereby assessing both wealth distribution and the relationships among the disparities, flow, and metabolism. We show that these result in a gamma-like wealth distribution, and our model reveals a trade-off between limiting disparities and vitalizing the market. To limit disparities and increase flow and metabolism, we also find the need to restrain savings and use the wealthy surplus stock. This relationship is explicitly expressed in the new equation introduced herein. The insights gained by uncovering the root of disparities may present a persuasive case for investments in social security measures or social businesses involving stock redistribution or sharing.","Kato, Takeshi; Hiroi, Yoshinori",,867,16

This is the first study to examine the most persuasive message type in terms of narrator difference in encouraging people to stay at home during the COVID-19 pandemic and social lockdown. METHODS: Participants (n = 1,980) were randomly assigned to five intervention messages (from a governor, a public health expert, a physician, a patient, and a resident of an outbreak area) and a control message. Intention to stay at home before and after reading messages was assessed. A one-way ANOVA with Tukey's or Games-Howell test was conducted.

However, the diagnostic performance of artificial intelligence to identify genetic diseases with facial phenotypes requires further investigation. The objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis are to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of artificial intelligence to identify the genetic diseases with face phenotypes and then find the best algorithm. METHODS: The systematic review will be conducted in accordance with the ""Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Protocols"" guidelines. The following electronic databases will be searched: PubMed, Web of Science, IEEE, Ovid, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and China National Knowledge Infrastructure. Two reviewers will screen and select the titles and abstracts of the studies retrieved independently during the database searches and perform full-text reviews and extract available data. The main outcome measures include diagnostic accuracy, as defined by accuracy, recall, specificity, and precision. The descriptive forest plot and summary receiver operating characteristic curves will be used to represent the performance of diagnostic tests. Subgroup analysis will be performed for different algorithms aided diagnosis tests. The quality of study characteristics and methodology will be assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 tool. Data will be synthesized by RevMan 5.3 and Meta-disc 1.4 software. RESULTS: The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis will be disseminated in a relevant peer-reviewed journal and academic presentations. CONCLUSION: To our knowledge, there have not been any systematic review or meta-analysis relating to diagnosis performance of artificial intelligence in identifying the genetic diseases with face phenotypes.

The pathophysiology of these lesions is still widely debated, and an association with SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unconfirmed. OBJECTIVES: This paper focuses on the unresolved issues about these COVID toes and, in particular, whether or not they are associated with COVID-19. ARGUMENTS: The temporal link between the outbreak of chilblains and the COVID-19 pandemic suggests a link between the two events. Positive anti-SARS-CoV/SARS-CoV-2 immunostaining on skin biopsy of chilblains seems to confirm the presence of the virus in the lesions but lacks specificity and must be interpreted with caution. Conversely, RT-PCR and anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology were negative in the majority of patients with chilblains. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 infection can be excluded, with relative certainty, even after accounting for possible lower immunization in mild/asymptomatic patients and for some differences in sensitivity/specificity between the tests used. Some authors hypothesize that chilblains could be the cutaneous expression of a strong type I interferon (IFN-I) response. High production of IFN-I is suggested to be associated with early viral control and may suppress antibody response. However, the absence of other cutaneous or extracutaneous symptoms, as observed in other interferonopathies, raises unanswered questions. To date, a direct link between chilblains and COVID-19 still seems impossible to confirm. A more indirect association due to lifestyle changes induced by lockdown is a possible explanation.

Mental health was consistently affected by the pandemic, with the emergence of newly diagnosed psychiatric disorders and the exacerbation of pre-existing ones. Urban areas were particularly affected by the virus spread. In this review, we analyze how the urban environment may influence mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic, considering two factors that profoundly characterize urbanization: air pollution and migration. Air pollution serves as a possibly risk factor for higher viral spread and infection severity in the context of urban areas and it has also been demonstrated to play a role in the development of serious mental illnesses and their relapses. The urban environment also represents a complex social context where minorities such as migrants may live in poor hygienic conditions and lack access to adequate mental health care. A global rethinking of the urban environment is thus required to reduce the impact of these factors on mental health. This should include actions aimed at reducing air pollution and combating climate change, promoting at the same time a more inclusive society in a sustainable development perspective.","Menculini, Giulia; Bernardini, Francesco; Attademo, Luigi; Balducci, Pierfrancesco Maria; Sciarma, Tiziana; Moretti, Patrizia; Tortorella, Alfonso",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),867,1

Using 2018 American Hospital Association data, we identified barriers to surveillance data reporting, and combined this with data on the projected impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hospital capacity at the hospital referral region (HRR) level. Our results find the most common barrier was public health agencies lacked the capacity to electronically receive data, with 41.2% of all hospitals reporting it. We also identified 31 HRRs in the top quartile of projected bed capacity needed for COVID-19 patients in which over half of hospitals in the area reported that the relevant public health agency was unable to receive electronic data. Public health agencies’ inability to receive electronic data is the most prominent hospital-reported barrier to effective syndromic surveillance.

Untreated OSA is associated with increased mortality and difficulties in social functioning. A delay in initiating treatment may therefore have harmful consequences. Between February and April 2020, the so-called first wave of the pandemic, the overall activity of sleep centers in Europe was reduced by 80%. As the international infection control authorities released guidelines for SARS-CoV-2 outbreak control, many of the national sleep societies provided strategies for a gradual re-opening of sleep facilities. Most of these strategies were not evidences-based and, in a climate of general concern, worldwide it was strongly advised to post-pone any non-urgent sleep-related procedure. Despite the initial idea that the outbreak could be transient, after one year it is still ongoing and the price we are paying, not only includes deaths caused by COVID-19, but also deaths caused by missed or late diagnosis. As further delays in diagnosing and treating patients with sleep apnea are no more acceptable, a new arrangement of sleep facilities and resources, in order to operate safely and effectively, is now mandatory. In this article, we review most recent literature and guidelines in order to provide practical advice for a new arrangement of sleep laboratories and the care of patients with obstructive sleep apnea after one year from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Spicuzza, Lucia; Sanna, Antonio",Sleep Med,867,6

Here we report on our finding that replacing MA with NC results in the production of wild type (wt)-level RNA and virus-like particles (VLPs). In contrast, constructs containing MA as a substitute for NC are markedly defective in VLP production and form virions with lower densities than wt, even though their RNA content is over 50% that of wt level. We also noted that a ΔMN mutant lacking both MA and NC produces a relatively higher amount of VLPs than those in which MA was substituted for NC. Although ΔMN contains approximately 30% the RNA of wt, it still exhibits virion densities equal (or very similar) to those of wt. The data suggest that neither NC nor RNA are major virion density determinants. Furthermore, we noted that NC(ZIP)—a NC replacement with a leucine zipper dimerization motif—produces VLPs as efficiently as wt. However, the markedly reduced assembly efficiency of NC(ZIP) is associated with the formation of VLPs with densities slightly lower than those of wt following MA removal, suggesting that (a) MA is required to help the inserted leucine zipper motif perform efficient Gag multimerization, and (b) MA plays a role in the virus assembly process.","Chang, Ching-Yuan; Chang, Yu-Fen; Wang, Shiu-Mei; Tseng, Ying-Tzu; Huang, Kuo-Jung; Wang, Chin-Tien",Virology,867,1

OBJECTIVES: We describe the CONAMAD study design, a prospective birth cohort consisting of multiparous women (18 and over) living in rural and peri-urban Peruvian Amazon communities exposed to ASGM. METHODS: Pregnant women are enrolled from health posts across four zones of Madre de Dios, Peru. Data are collected at enrollment, childbirth, and (planned) 36-48 months. At enrollment, hair samples for mercury assessment, demographic and clinical data are obtained. At birth, we obtain venous and cord blood, placenta, hair, toenails, and saliva. FINDINGS: Two hundred seventy mothers were enrolled at an average 20 weeks gestational age with no differences in maternal characteristics across zones. Two hundred fifteen mothers were successfully followed at birth. We obtained 214 maternal and cord blood samples, 211 maternal and 212 infant hair samples, 212 placenta samples, 210 infant saliva samples, and 214 infant dried blood spots. Data collected will allow for testing our primary hypotheses of maternal malnutrition modifying ratios of cord:maternal blood total mercury (tHg), cord blood:maternal hair tHg, and infant:maternal hair tHg, and whether chemical mixtures (Hg, Pb, Cd) have synergistic effects on infant neurodevelopment. CONCLUSIONS: CONAMAD is designed to collect and store samples for future processing and hypothesis testing associated with in-utero mercury exposure and child development.

One such shift is the expanded emphasis on environmental surveillance for pathogens. Environmental surveillance methods have primarily relied upon wastewater and indoor surface testing, and despite substantial evidence that SARS-CoV-2 commonly travels through space in aerosols, there has been limited indoor air surveillance. This study investigated the effectiveness of integrated surveillance including an active air sampler, surface swabs and passive settling plates to detect SARS-CoV-2 in hospital rooms with COVID-19 patients and compared detection efficacy among sampling methods. The AerosolSense active air sampler was found to detect SARS-CoV-2 in 53.8% of all samples collected compared to 12.1% detection by passive air sampling and 14.8% detection by surface swabs. Approximately 69% of sampled rooms (22/32) returned a positive environmental sample of any type. Among positive rooms, ~32% had only active air samples that returned positive, while ~27% and ~9% had only one or more surface swabs or passive settling plates that returned a positive respectively, and ~32% had more than one sample type that returned a positive result.

This study aimed to build the link between functional magnetic resonance imaging data obtained before the stress event and the subsequent stress-related depressive symptoms. METHODS Neuroimaging data obtained before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic from 39 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 61 health controls (HCs) were used in this study. The participants were divided retrospectively into four groups in accordance with the severity of depressive symptoms during the pandemic: remitted patients, non-remitted patients, depressed HCs (HCd) and non-depressed HCs (HCnd). Seed-based resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) analyses of the amygdala and its subregions, including centromedial (CM), basolateral and superficial (SF), were performed. RESULTS Vulnerability to depression was suggested by the decreased rsFC between the left CM amygdala and the bilateral lingual gyrus in the HCd group compared with the HCnd group, and decreased rsFC of the left CM or right SF amygdala with the precuneus and the postcentral gyrus in the HCd group compared with patients with MDD. No evidence supports the rsFC of the amygdala or its subregions as a biomarker for the resilience of patients with MDD to stress under antidepressant treatment. LIMITATIONS Smaller sample size and no longitudinal neuroimaging data. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that the rsFC of amygdala subregions may represent a neurobiological marker of vulnerability to depression following stress.","Zhang, Shudong; Cui, Jian; Zhang, Zhifang; Wang, Yun; Liu, Rui; Chen, Xiongying; Feng, Yuan; Zhou, Jingjing; Zhou, Yuan; Wang, Gang",Journal of affective disorders,867,9

Methods: We quantified time in days from symptom onset until testing (latency one) and delay in test results report (latency two) using freely available country-wide open data from Mexico and Colombia. Directed acyclic graphs were built to determine which associations were appropriate to assess. Stratification by margination status, state and hospitalization status was used to determine corresponding associations. Results: In almost all the study period latency two was longer than latency one. Median latency one was 3 (IQR 0-6) days and latency two 7 (IQR 4-11) days in Colombia, while in Mexico they were 3 (IQR 1-5) days and 4 (IQR 3-6) days. In Colombia, worse margination status prolonged latency two. In Mexico, a lower number and percentage of point-of-care (POC) tests in areas with worse margination. Conclusion: POC tests must be used as a widespread means to reduce latency two, and until then should be prioritized in areas with longer latency two.

Adverse income shocks have caused malnutrition and food insecurity and have increased the need for food assistance. The present study examines the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on food insecurity and investigates the determinants of food security and coping strategies in the Punjab province of Pakistan. Data were collected through the internet and received responses from 370 respondents. The household food insecurity access scale (HFIAS) model was applied to examine food insecurity, and a logit regression model was used to analyze its determining factors. The results illustrate that food insecurity substantially increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. Households’ demographics and socioeconomic factors have influence on food insecurity. Households with a large family size and people in quarantine found more food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic, while financial assistance played a role in a decline in food insecurity. Households handle the negative income shocks by eating less preferred food and getting support from government and charity organizations. It is suggested that stakeholders and responsible institutes provide financial assistance to support low-income families in order to enhance food security. Furthermore, policymakers should strengthen social safety nets and aid programs such as the Ehsas income program in the province of the country.","Shahzad, Muhammad Aamir; Qing, Ping; Rizwan, Muhammad; Razzaq, Amar; Faisal, Muhammad",Healthcare (Basel),867,16

A dysregulated stress system is a consistent finding, however, and exhaustion is a consistent trait in adolescent patients. The aim of this paper is to critically assess current hypotheses in adolescent depression research and reframe causes and treatment approaches. METHODS: A mixed-method approach involved a review based on publications from PubMed, Embase and PsycInfo, and two exemplary adolescent cases. RESULTS: Both cases show a spiral of stress and exhaustion, but with a different profile of symptoms and coping mechanisms. Reframing both cases from the perspective of coping behavior, searching for the sources of experienced stress and exhaustion, showed coping similarities. This proved essential in the successful personalized treatment and recovery process. In combination with recent evidence, both cases support the functional reframing of depression as the outcome of a stress- and exhaustion-related spiralling mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: We propose to open up a symptom-based, mood-centered view to a model in which adolescent depression is framed as a consecutive failure of stress coping mechanisms and chronic exhaustion. Addressing exhaustion and coping primarily as a treatment strategy in adolescents and young adults might work in synergy with existing treatments and improve overall outcomes. This perspective warrants further investigation.","van der Gronde, Toon; Los, Leontien; Herremans, Arnoud; Oosting, Ronald; Zorzanelli, Rafaela; Pieters, Toine",Front Psychiatry,867,5

Materials and Methods: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in four hospitals in China from January 22, 2020 to April 15, 2020 were retrospectively enrolled. The demographic, laboratory, and clinical data of the patients with COVID-19 were collected. The independent risk factors related to the severity of and death due to COVID-19 were identified with a multivariate logistic regression; a nomogram and prediction model were established. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and predictive accuracy were used to evaluate the model's effectiveness. Results: In total, 582 patients with COVID-19, including 116 patients with severe disease, were enrolled. Their comorbidities, body temperature, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet (PLT) count, and levels of total bilirubin (Tbil), creatinine (Cr), creatine kinase (CK), and albumin (Alb) were independent risk factors for severe disease. A nomogram was generated based on these eight variables with a predictive accuracy of 85.9% and an AUROC of 0.858 (95% CI, 0.823–0.893). Based on the nomogram, the CANPT score was established with cut-off values of 12 and 16. The percentages of patients with severe disease in the groups with CANPT scores <12, ≥12, and <16, and ≥16 were 4.15, 27.43, and 69.64%, respectively. Seventeen patients died. NLR, Cr, CK, and Alb were independent risk factors for mortality, and the CAN score was established to predict mortality. With a cut-off value of 15, the predictive accuracy was 97.4%, and the AUROC was 0.903 (95% CI 0.832, 0.974).

Recent reports have demonstrated the involvement of vitamin B3 in a number of pivotal functions which ensure that homeostasis is maintained. In addition, the intriguing nature of its synthesis and the underlying mechanism of action of vitamin B3 have encouraged further studies aimed at deepening our understanding of the close link between the exogenous supply of B3 and how it activates dependent enzymes. This crucial role can be attributed to the gut microflora and its ability to shape human behavior and development by mediating the bioavailability of metabolites. Recent studies have indicated a possible interconnection between the novel coronavirus and commensal bacteria. As such, we have attempted to explain how the gastrointestinal deficiencies displayed by SARS-CoV-2-infected patients arise. It seems that the stimulation of a proinflammatory cascade and the production of large amounts of reactive oxygen species culminates in the subsequent loss of host eubiosis.

Bexarotene demonstrated the highest Cmax:EC(50) ratio (1.69) which was higher than those of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and ivermectin. These results demonstrated the efficacy of the two-tier screening system and identified potential COVID-19 treatments which can achieve effective levels if given by inhalation or systemically depending on their pharmacokinetics.","Yuan, Shuofeng; Chan, Jasper F.W.; Chik, Kenn K.H.; Chan, Chris C.Y.; Tsang, Jessica O.L.; Liang, Ronghui; Cao, Jianli; Tang, Kaiming; Chen, Lin-Lei; Wen, Kun; Cai, Jian-Piao; Ye, Zi-Wei; Lu, Gang; Chu, Hin; Jin, Dong-Yan; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Pharmacol Res,867,26

It affects individuals from the order Artiodactyla, such as cattle, swine, sheep, wild animals from this order, and a few non-cloven hoofed species, such as mice and elephants. FMD causes large-scale economic losses for agricultural production systems; morbidity is almost 100% in an affected population, accompanied by a high mortality rate in young animals due to myocarditis or an inability to suckle if a mother is ill. The aetiological agent is an Aphthovirus from the family Picornaviridae, having seven serotypes: A, O, C, SAT1, SAT2, SAT3, and Asia 1. Serotype variability means that an immune response is serospecific and vaccines are thus designed to protect against each serotype independently. A host’s adaptive immune response is key in defence against pathogens; however, this virus uses successful strategies (along with most microorganisms) enabling it to evade a host’s immune system to rapidly and efficiently establish itself within such host, and thus remain there. This review has been aimed at an in-depth analysis of the immune response in cattle and swine regarding FMD virus, the possible evasion mechanisms used by the virus and describing some immunological differences regarding these species. Such aspects can provide pertinent knowledge for developing new FMD control and prevention strategies.","Rodríguez-Habibe, Ibett; Celis-Giraldo, Carmen; Patarroyo, Manuel Elkin; Avendaño, Catalina; Patarroyo, Manuel Alfonso",Vaccines (Basel),867,28

As such, there has been a rapid escalation in scientific and clinical activity aimed at increasing our comprehension of this virus. This volume of work has led to early insights into risk factors associated with severity of disease, and mechanisms that underpin the virulence and dynamics involved in viral transmission. These insights ultimately may help guide potential therapeutics to reduce the human, economic and social impact of this pandemic. Importantly, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract has emerged as an important organ influencing propensity to, and potentially severity of, COVID-19 infection. Furthermore, the gut microbiome has been linked to a variety of risk factors for COVID-19 infection, and manipulation of the gut microbiome is an attractive potential therapeutic target for a number of diseases. While data profiling the gut microbiome in COVID-19 infection to date are limited, they support the possibility of several routes of interaction between COVID-19, the gut microbiome, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) expression in the small bowel and colon and gut inflammation. This article will explore the evidence that implicates the gut microbiome as a contributing factor to the pathogenesis, severity and disease course of COVID-19, and speculate about the gut microbiome’s capability as a therapeutic avenue against COVID-19. LAY SUMMARY: It has been noted that certain baseline gut profiles of COVID-19 patients are associated with a more severe disease course, and the gut microbiome impacts the disease course of several contributory risk factors to the severity of COVID-19. A protein called ACE-2, which is found in the small intestine among other sites, is a key receptor for COVID-19 virus entry; there is evidence that the gut microbiome influences ACE-2 receptor expression, and hence may play a role in influencing COVID-19 infectivity and disease severity. Furthermore, the gut microbiome plays a significant role in immune regulation, and hence may be pivotal in influencing the immune response to COVID-19. In terms of understanding COVID-19 treatments, the gut microbiome is known to interact with several drug classes being used to target COVID-19 and should be factored into our understanding of how patients respond to treatment. Importantly, our understanding of the role of the gut microbiome in COVID-19 infection remains in its infancy, but future research may potentially aid our mechanistic understanding of viral infection, and new ways in which we might approach treating it.","Segal, Jonathan P.; Mak, Joyce W.

The aims of this study were to investigate the prevalence and the clinical impact of VRTIs in patients with CAP. Prospective study involving adult patients consecutively admitted at medical wards for CAP and tested for VRTIs by real-time PCR on pharyngeal swab. Patients’ features were evaluated with regard to the presence of VRTI and aetiology of CAP. Clinical failure was a composite endpoint defined by worsening of signs and symptoms requiring escalation of antibiotic treatment or ICU admission or death within 30 days. 91 patients were enrolled, mean age 65.7 ± 10.6 years, 50.5% female. 62 patients (68.2%) had no viral co-infection while in 29 patients (31.8%) a VRTI was detected; influenza virus was the most frequently identified (41.9%). The two groups were similar in terms of baseline features. In presence of a VRTI, pneumonia severity index (PSI) was more frequently higher than 91 and patients had received less frequently pre-admission antibiotic therapy (adjusted OR 2.689, 95% CI 1.017–7.111, p = 0.046; adjusted OR 0.143, 95% CI 0.030–0.670, p = 0.014). Clinical failure and antibiotic therapy duration were similar with regards to the presence of VRTI and the aetiology of CAP. VRTIs can be detected in almost a third of adults with CAP; influenza virus is the most relevant one. VRTI was associated with higher PSI at admission, but it does not affect patients’ outcome.","Tatarelli, P.; Magnasco, L.; Borghesi, M.

Several cellular receptors are involved in SARS-CoV-2 Spike docking at the cell surface, including ACE2 and neuropilin. The intermediate filament protein vimentin has been reported to be present at the surface of certain cells and act as a co-receptor for several viruses; furthermore, its potential involvement in interactions with Spike proteins has been proposed. Here we have explored the binding of Spike protein constructs to several cell types using low-temperature immunofluorescence approaches in live cells, to minimize internalization. Incubation of cells with tagged Spike S or Spike S1 subunit led to discrete dotted patterns at the cell surface, which showed scarce colocalization with a lipid raft marker, but consistent coincidence with ACE2. Under our conditions, vimentin immunoreactivity appeared as spots or patches unevenly distributed at the surface of diverse cell types. Remarkably, several observations including potential antibody internalization and adherence to cells of vimentin-positive structures present in the extracellular medium exposed the complexity of vimentin cell surface immunoreactivity, which requires careful assessment. Notably, overall colocalization of Spike and vimentin signals markedly varied with the cell type and the immunodetection sequence. In turn, vimentin-positive spots moderately colocalized with ACE2; however, a particular enrichment was detected at elongated structures positive for acetylated tubulin, consistent with primary cilia, which also showed Spike binding. Thus, these results suggest that vimentin-ACE2 interaction could occur at selective locations near the cell surface, including ciliated structures, which can act as platforms for SARS-CoV-2 docking.","Lalioti, Vasiliki; González-Sanz, Silvia; Lois-Bermejo, Irene; González-Jiménez, Patricia; Viedma-Poyatos, Álvaro; Merino, Andrea; A.

Materials and methods This retrospective institutional review board-approved study included 74 patients (mean age 61 ± 18 years, male:female 34:40) with COVID-19 pneumonia in two countries (one with 68 patients, and the other with six patients) who underwent DECT-PA on either dual-source (DS) or single-source (SS) multidetector CT machines. Images from DS-DECT-PA were processed to obtain virtual mono-energetic 40 keV (Mono40), material decomposition iodine (MDI) images and quantitative perfusion statistics (QPS). Two thoracic radiologists determined CT severity scores based on type and extent of pulmonary opacities, assessed presence of PE, and pulmonary parenchymal perfusion on MDI images. The QPS were calculated from the CT Lung Isolation prototype (Siemens). The correlated clinical outcomes included duration of hospital stay, intubation, SpO2 and death. The significance of association was determined by receiver operating characteristics and analysis of variance. Results One-fifth (20.2%, 15/74 patients) had pulmonary arterial filling defects; most filling defects were occlusive (28/44) located in the segmental and sub-segmental arteries. The parenchymal opacities were more extensive and denser (CT severity score 24 ± 4) in patients with arterial filling defects than without filling defects (20 ± 8; p=0.028). Ground-glass opacities demonstrated increased iodine distribution; mixed and consolidative opacities had reduced iodine on DS-DECT-PA but increased or heterogeneous iodine content on SS-DECT-PA. QPS were significantly lower in patients with low SpO2 (p=0.003), intubation (p=0.006), and pulmonary arterial filling defects (p=0.007). Conclusion DECT-PA QPS correlated with clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients.","Arru, C. D.; Digumarthy, S.; Hansen, J. V.; Lyhne, M. D.; Singh, R.; Rosovsky, R.; Nielsen-Kudsk, J.
