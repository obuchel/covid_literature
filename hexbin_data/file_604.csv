Although this approach is often slow and requires considerable technical expertise, it has been regarded for decades as the ""gold standard"" for the laboratory diagnosis of viral disease. With the development of nonculture methods for the rapid detection of viral antigens and/or nucleic acids, the usefulness of viral culture has been questioned. This review describes advances in cell culture-based viral diagnostic products and techniques, including the use of newer cell culture formats, cryopreserved cell cultures, centrifugation-enhanced inoculation, precytopathogenic effect detection, cocultivated cell cultures, and transgenic cell lines. All of these contribute to more efficient and less technically demanding viral detection in cell culture. Although most laboratories combine various culture and nonculture approaches to optimize viral disease diagnosis, virus isolation in cell culture remains a useful approach, especially when a viable isolate is needed, if viable and nonviable virus must be differentiated, when infection is not characteristic of any single virus (i.e., when testing for only one virus is not sufficient), and when available culture-based methods can provide a result in a more timely fashion than molecular methods.","Leland, Diane S; Ginocchio, Christine C",Clinical microbiology reviews,604,3

Even with modern medical and public health standards, infectious disease remained the No. 1 killer worldwide at the turn of the century. Often, the most costly disease burdens come from multiple infections at once, i.e., coinfection. Influenza, an annual infection often considered relatively harmless, can increase susceptibility to both deadly bacterial pneumonia and childhood ear infections. Major health threat HIV rarely kills a patient on its own, but instead allows for opportunistic infections and re-emergence of infections such as tuberculosis. What generates these unique relationships is not well understood; herein, we examine in detail three types of coinfection and the unique interactions between infectious agents as well as with the host in each setting. We also begin to address how we may aid further understanding of coinfection and what questions need to be addressed to help direct future treatments.","Pasman, Lesley",The Yale journal of biology and medicine,604,3

The problem is not only that they are difficult to identify and test, but also that it is believed that they may constitute the bulk of the cases and could be crucial in the pandemic equation. Methods: We present a novel algorithm to extract the number of these mild cases by correlating a COVID-line calls to reported cases in given districts. The key assumption is to realize that, being a highly contagious disease, the number of calls by mild cases should be proportional to the number of reported cases. Whereas a background of calls not related to infected people should be proportional to the district population. Results: We find that for Buenos Aires Province, in addition to the background, there are in signal 6.6 +/- 0.4 calls per each reported COVID-19 case. Using this we estimate in Buenos Aires Province 20 +/- 2 COVID-19 symptomatic cases for each one reported. Conclusions: A very simple algorithm that models the COVID-line calls as sum of signal plus background allows to estimate the crucial number of the rate of symptomatic to reported COVID-19 cases in a given district. The result from this method is an early and inexpensive estimate and should be contrasted to other methods such as serology and/or massive testing.","Alvarez, Ezequiel; Marsico, Franco",,604,28

Non-clinical sociodemographic features are important explanatory variables of COVID-19 outcomes, revealing existing disparities in large health care systems. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We use nation-wide multicenter data of COVID-19 patients in Brazil to predict mortality and ventilator usage. The dataset contains hospitalized patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and had either recovered or were deceased between March 1 and June 30, 2020. A total of 113,214 patients with 50,387 deceased, were included. Both interpretable (sparse versions of Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines) and state-of-the-art non-interpretable (Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and Random Forest) classification methods are employed. Death from COVID-19 was strongly associated with demographics, socioeconomic factors, and comorbidities. Variables highly predictive of mortality included geographic location of the hospital (OR = 2.2 for Northeast region, OR = 2.1 for North region); renal (OR = 2.0) and liver (OR = 1.7) chronic disease; immunosuppression (OR = 1.7); obesity (OR = 1.7); neurological (OR = 1.6), cardiovascular (OR = 1.5), and hematologic (OR = 1.2) disease; diabetes (OR = 1.4); chronic pneumopathy (OR = 1.4); immunosuppression (OR = 1.3); respiratory symptoms, ranging from respiratory discomfort (OR = 1.4) and dyspnea (OR = 1.3) to oxygen saturation less than 95% (OR = 1.7); hospitalization in a public hospital (OR = 1.2); and self-reported patient illiteracy (OR = 1.1). Validation accuracies (AUC) for predicting mortality and ventilation need reach 79% and 70%, respectively, when using only pre-admission variables. Models that use post-admission disease progression information reach accuracies (AUC) of 86% and 87% for predicting mortality and ventilation use, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the predictive power of socioeconomic information in assessing COVID-19 mortality and medical resource allocation, and shed light on existing disparities in the Brazilian health care system during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wollenstein-Betech, Salomón; Silva, Amanda A B; Fleck, Julia L; Cassandras, Christos G; Paschalidis, Ioannis Ch",PLoS One,604,3

In particular, the data from Nepal, a developing country having an open border provision with highly COVID-19 affected country India, has shown a biphasic pattern of epidemic, a controlled phase (until July 21, 2020) followed by an outgrown phase (after July 21, 2020). To uncover the effective strategies implemented during the controlled phase, we develop a mathematical model that is able to describe the data from both phases of COVID-19 dynamics in Nepal. Using our best parameter estimates with 95% confidence interval, we found that during the controlled phase most of the recorded cases were imported from outside the country with a small number generated from the local transmission, consistent with the data. Our model predicts that these successful strategies were able to maintain the reproduction number at around 0.21 during the controlled phase, preventing 442,640 cases of COVID-19 and saving more than 1,200 lives in Nepal. However, during the outgrown phase, when the strategies such as border screening and quarantine, lockdown, and detection and isolation, were altered, the reproduction number raised to 1.8, resulting in exponentially growing cases of COVID-19. We further used our model to predict the long-term dynamics of COVID-19 in Nepal and found that without any interventions the current trend may result in about 18.76 million cases (10.70 million detected and 8.06 million undetected) and 89 thousand deaths in Nepal by the end of 2021. Finally, using our predictive model, we evaluated the effects of various control strategies on the long-term outcome of this epidemics and identified ideal strategies to curb the epidemic in Nepal.","Adhikari, Khagendra; Gautam, Ramesh; Pokharel, Anjana; Uprety, Kedar Nath; Vaidya, Naveen K",J Theor Biol,604,6

AIM OF STUDY To identify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the structure of acute poisonings based on their comparative analysis for March-May in 2019 and 2020. MATERIAl AND METHODS “Hospital patient cards” of patients who were treated in the Department of Acute Toxicosis and Somatopsychiatric Disorders of the N. V. Sklifosovsky Research Institute for Emergency Medicine in March–May, 2019 and 2020. The Statistica 10.0 program was used for data processing. RESUlTS The total number and gender composition of patients with acute poisonings (AP) did not differ significantly in the compared periods. In 2020, the share of people aged 30–39 increased by 23%, while patients over 50 decreased by 7%. In 2020, the frequency of AP caused by medicines decreased by 10%, with sedatives and antidepressants prevailing. There has been an increase in cases of overdose with NSAIDs, antibiotics and antiviral drugs, probably as a result of self-treatment for Covid-19. The share of drug and psychoactive substance poisoning increased by 5%, mainly due to overdoses of synthetic drugs and combinations of drugs of different groups. At the same time, the number of cases of recreational drug use decreased 2.4-fold. In March-May 2020, the number of patients with severe AP caused by alcohol increased 4-fold, and the number of people with other forms of AP hospitalized with alcohol intoxication grew 2.7-fold. Additionally, twice as many household AP have been caused by chlorine vapor, as well as poisoning with isopropyl alcohol, which can be associated with frequent improper use of disinfectants. CONClUSION Thus, the pandemic and the introduction of restrictive measures for COVID-19 affected the structure of acute exotoxicosis in Moscow in the period March-May 2020.

This study seeks to provide trends and analysis from the provincial BC THN program since inception in 2012 to the end of 2018. MATERIALS AND METHODS: BC THN shipment and distribution records from 2012–2018 were retrieved. Frequency distributions were used to describe characteristics of individuals accessing the program. To evaluate correlates of distribution after the addition of hundreds of pharmacy distribution sites, an analytic sample was limited to records from 2018, and multivariate logistic regression was used to evaluate correlates of collecting naloxone at a pharmacy site. RESULTS: Since program inception to the end of 2018, there were 398,167 naloxone kits shipped to distribution sites, 149,999 kits reported distributed, and 40,903 kits reported used to reverse an overdose in BC. There was a significant increasing trend in the number of naloxone kits used to reverse an overdose over time (p<0.01), and more than 90% of kits that were reported used were distributed to persons at risk of an overdose. Individuals not personally at risk of overdose had higher odds of collecting naloxone at a pharmacy site, compared to other community sites (including harm reduction supply distribution sites, peer led organizations, drop-in centers, and supportive housing sites) (Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR): 2.69; 95% CI: 2.50–2.90). CONCLUSIONS: This study documents thousands of opioid overdose reversals facilitated through the BC THN program. While those at highest risk of overdose may preferentially access naloxone through community sites, naloxone distribution through pharmacies has allowed the BC THN program to expand dramatically, increasing naloxone availability through longer opening hours on evenings and weekends. and in rural and remote regions. A diversity of naloxone distribution sites and strategies is crucial to prevent rising opioid overdose deaths.","Moustaqim-Barrette, Amina; Papamihali, Kristi; Mamdani, Zahra; Williams, Sierra; Buxton, Jane A.",PLoS One,604,16

It affects all age classes of animals but lethality is mainly seen in suckling piglets. After its first appearance in England in 1971, Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has spread worldwide. While sporadic outbreaks prevailed in Europe, the disease had high impact in Asia. Following particularly severe outbreaks in 2011, high impact cases were also reported in the United States and neighboring countries in 2013. Subsequently, outbreaks were also reported in several European countries including Germany. These outbreaks were less severe. This case report describes a recent case of PED re-emergence in Germany and the sequence analyses of the causative PEDV. CASE PRESENTATION: In spring 2019 5 years after re-introduction of PED into Central Europe, a piglet-producer in northwestern Germany experienced an outbreak that affected sows, their suckling piglets, and weaners. After initial confirmation of PEDV by real-time RT-PCR, fecal material and small intestine samples from affected pigs were subjected to metagenomic analyses employing next-generation sequencing. Phylogenetic analyses showed high identities among the PEDV sequences obtained from samples of different animals and a close relation to recent strains from Hungary and France. Compared to the PEDV strains analyzed in 2014, genetic drift could be confirmed. Changes were mainly observed in the spike protein encoding S gene segment. In addition, metagenomic analyses showed multiple Picobirnavirus reads in all investigated samples. CONCLUSION: This case report shows that PEDV is still circulating in Europe. The causative strains are moderately virulent and are still closely related to the so-called INDEL strains reported previously in Europe, including Germany. However, a genetic drift has taken place that can be seen in a novel cluster comprising strains from Germany, Hungary and France in 2019. Relevance and impact of the detected Picobirna sequences need further investigations.","Karte, Claudia; Platje, Nadine; Bullermann, Johannes; Beer, Martin; Höper, Dirk; Blome, Sandra",BMC Vet Res,604,12
