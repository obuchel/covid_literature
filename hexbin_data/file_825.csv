59411,Early Data From Case Series of Tracheostomy in Patients With SARS-CoV-2.,2020-06-30,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has severely impacted daily life all over the world. Any measures to slow down the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and to decrease disease severity are highly requested. Recent studies have reported inverse correlations between plasma levels of vitamin D and susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 severity. Therefore, it has been proposed to supplement the general population with vitamin D to reduce the impact of COVID-19. However, by studying the course of COVID-19 and the immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in a family with a mutated, non-functional vitamin D receptor, we here demonstrate that vitamin D signaling was dispensable for mounting an efficient adaptive immune response against SARS-CoV-2 in this family. Although these observations might not directly be transferred to the general population, they question a central role of vitamin D in the generation of adaptive immunity against SARS-CoV-2.","Kongsbak-Wismann, Martin; Al-Jaberi, Fatima A.

59663,Cognitive Screening of Adults With Postlingual Hearing Loss: A Systematic Review.,2020-07-21,"Asymptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (aICH) is a common phenomenon in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) treated with endovascular thrombectomy (ET). However, the impact of aICH on the functional outcome remains widely unclear. In this study, we aimed at identifying predictors for aICH and analyzing its impact on functional outcome. Patients with AIS due to large artery occlusion in the anterior circulation treated with successful ET were enrolled in a tertiary stroke center. Patients with aICH or without intracerebral hemorrhage were included according to post-treatment CT performed within 72 h; 100 consecutive patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 30% classified with aICH. In logistic regression analysis, lower collateral score (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.12-0.46, p < 0.0001) was significantly associated with aICH. Less patients with aICH achieved an independent outcome (mRS 0-2, 16.7% vs. 44.3%, p = 0.007). Poor outcome (mRS 4-6) was significantly higher in patients with aICH (41.4% vs. 70%, p = 0.021). Patients with aICH had a lower ratio of independent outcome (OR 0.23, 95% CI 0.05-0.1.05, p = 0.041) than without ICH. There were no differences concerning poor outcome (p = 0.5). Lower collateral status was a strong independent predictor for aICH. aICH after successful ET may decrease the likelihood of an independent functional outcome without influencing poor outcome.","Nawabi, Jawed; Kniep, Helge; Broocks, Gabriel; Faizy, Tobias D; Schön, Gerhard; Thomalla, G; Fiehler, Jens; Hanning, Uta",Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1177/0271678x19871253; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31433715/,825

Initial infection is usually asymptomatic and result in chronic hepatitis that give rise to complications including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The management of HCV infection should not only be focus on therapy, but also to screen carrier individuals in order to prevent transmission. In the present, molecular detection and quantification of HCV genome by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) represent the gold standard in HCV diagnosis and plays a crucial role in the management of therapeutic regimens. However, real time PCR is a complicated approach and of limited distribution. On the other hand, isothermal DNA amplification techniques have been developed and offer molecular diagnosis of infectious dieses at point-of-care. In this review we discuss recombinase polymerase amplification technique and illustrate its diagnostic value over both PCR and other isothermal amplification techniques.","Zaghloul, Hosam; El-Shahat, Mahmoud",World journal of hepatology,https://doi.org/10.4254/wjh.v6.i12.916; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25544878/,825

The current pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has again revealed how vulnerable we remain. Muslims constitute the world's second-largest religious group, making up about a quarter of the world population. They have distinctive faith and culture, pertaining to their religious beliefs and practices that need special attention, in situations such as current COVID-19 pandemic. Congregational prayers are an indispensable part of Islamic culture. Performance of obligatory prayers in congregation is compulsory and mandatory for every Muslim adult male who has no excuse for not doing so. But, doing so during a pandemic can help in the spread of the COVID-19. Muslims look up to the Holy Qur'an and teachings of Prophet (PBUH) (Hadiths) for guidance under all the circumstances. In this review we will cover how Islamic teaching can guide us to manage pandemics like COVID-19.","Ashraf, Hamid; Faraz, Ahmad; Raihan, Md; Kalra, Sanjay",JPMA.

61791,Audiometric Outcomes and Middle Ear Disease following Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak Repair.,2020-03-24,"Excessive nickel (Ni) accumulation in edible parts of the plants has become a serious challenge for food security over the past few decades. Therefore, in this study, the role of calcium (Ca2+) signaling in imparting Ni tolerance was investigated in zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L. cv Courgette d'Italie). Exposure of zucchini seedlings to Hogland solution containing 0.28 mmol L-1 Ni(NO3)2 reduced plant growth, the content of chlorophyll and carotenoids and the relative water content (RWC) in leaves, increased Ni accumulation that was accompanied to depletion of the essential bivalent cations and induced oxidative stress and proline accumulation in both shoots and roots. Pretreatment with the nutrient solution containing 15 mmol L-1 calcium chloride (CaCl2), significantly improved zucchini growth and photosynthetic pigment contents and maintained RWC in leaves under both control and Ni stress conditions. Pretreatment with CaCl2 reduced Ni accumulation, modified cation homeostasis, increased the activities of peroxidase and catalase enzymes and lowered Ni-induced accumulation of hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde and proline in leaves and roots. Pre-exposure of root with Ca2+ chelator (ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid) and plasma membrane Ca2+ channel blocker (lanthanum chloride) impaired impact of Ca2+ on the aforementioned attributes. Outcomes of this study not only highlight the signaling role of Ca2+ in regulating defensive responses but also suggest an eco- friendly approach for reducing the Ni contamination in plants that ensure food safety.","Valivand, Maryam; Amooaghaie, Rayhaneh",International journal of phytoremediation,https://doi.org/10.1080/15226514.2020.1814992; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32940550/,825
61878,Persistent Smell Loss Following Undetectable SARS-CoV-2.,2020-06-09,"BACKGROUND Influenza A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09 and B viruses co-circulated in Europe in 2017-18, predominated by influenza B. WHO-recommended, trivalent vaccine components were lineage-mismatched for B. The I-MOVE hospital network measured 2017-18 seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against influenza A(H3N2) and B among hospitalised patients (≥65 years) in Europe. METHODS Following the same generic protocol for test-negative design, hospital teams in nine countries swabbed patients ≥65 years with recent onset (≤7 days) severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), collecting information on demographics, vaccination status and underlying conditions. Cases were RT-PCR positive for influenza A(H3N2) or B; controls: negative for any influenza. ""Vaccinated"" patients had SARI onset >14 days after vaccination. We measured pooled IVE against influenza, adjusted for study site, age, sex, onset date and chronic conditions. RESULTS We included 3483 patients: 376 influenza A(H3N2) and 928 B cases, and 2028 controls. Most (>99%) vaccinated patients received the B lineage-mismatched trivalent vaccine. IVE against influenza A(H3N2) was 24% (95% CI: 2 to 40); 35% (95% CI: 6 to 55) in 65- to 79-year-olds and 14% (95% CI: -22 to 39) in ≥80-year-olds. Against influenza B, IVE was 30% (95% CI: 16 to 41); 37% (95% CI: 19 to 51) in 65- to 79-year-olds and 19% (95% CI: -7 to 38) in ≥80-year-olds. CONCLUSIONS IVE against influenza B was similar to A(H3N2) in hospitalised older adults, despite trivalent vaccine and circulating B lineage mismatch, suggesting some cross-protection. IVE was lower in those ≥80 than 65-79 years. We reinforce the importance of influenza vaccination in older adults as, even with a poorly matched vaccine, it still protects one in three to four of this population from severe influenza.","Rose, Angela M C; Kissling, Esther; Gherasim, Alin; Casado, Itziar; Bella, Antonino; Launay, Odile; Lazăr, Mihaela; Marbus, Sierk; Kuliese, Monika; Syrjänen, Ritva; Machado, Ausenda; Kurečić Filipović, Sanja; Larrauri, Amparo; Castilla, Jesús; Alfonsi, Valeria; Galtier, Florence; Ivanciuc, Alina; Meijer, Adam; Mickiene, Aukse; Ikonen, Niina; Gómez, Verónica; Lovrić Makarić, Zvjezdana; Moren, Alain; Valenciano, Marta",Influenza and other respiratory viruses,https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12714; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32022450/,825

62459,Initial Load Stability of Different Trachea Suture Techniques: Tests on an Ex Vivo Model.,2018,"Optimal antithrombotic pharmacotherapy in patients affected by diabetes mellitus (DM) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention is unclear. We sought to evaluate the safety and efficacy of bivalirudin compared with heparin plus a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (GPI) in patients with DM undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. We pooled patient-level data from the Randomized Evaluation of PCI Linking Angiomax to Reduced Clinical Events-2, Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage strategy, and Harmonizing Outcomes with Revascularization and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction trials. The primary efficacy end point was the incidence of major adverse cardiac events, defined as the composite of death, myocardial infarction, or unplanned revascularization at 30 days. The primary safety end point was the incidence of 30-day non-coronary artery bypass graft-related major bleeding. All-cause mortality was reported at 30 days and 1 year. Of the 14,737 patients included in the pooled database, 3,641 (24.7%) had DM. Patients with DM had higher rates of 30-day major bleeding and 30-day and 1-year all-cause mortality. There were no differences in 30-day major adverse cardiac events between bivalirudin versus heparin plus GPI in patients with DM (6.9% vs 7.8%; relative risk [RR] 0.89, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.12) or without DM (7.5% vs 6.7%; RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.27; pinteraction = 0.10). Bivalirudin treatment was associated with reduced risk of major bleeding in similar magnitude in patients with DM (4.3% vs 6.6% RR 0.68, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.89) or without DM (3.2% vs 6.1%; RR 0.51, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.61; pinteraction = 0.15). The hemorrhagic benefit of bivalirudin was noted for both access site- and non-access site-related bleeding. Overall, bivalirudin treatment was associated with a significant 1-year mortality benefit (2.7% vs 3.3%; RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.98; p = 0.03), which was consistent between patients with or without DM (pinteraction = 0.30). In conclusion, compared with heparin plus GPI, bivalirudin was associated with similar 30-day antithrombotic efficacy and better 30-day freedom from bleeding and 1-year mortality, irrespective of diabetic status.","Giustino, Gennaro; Mehran, Roxana; Bansilal, Sameer; Feit, Frederick; Lincoff, Michael; Deliargyris, Efthymios N; Kirtane, Ajay J; Généreux, Philippe; Redfors, Bjorn; Prats, Jayne; Bernstein, Debra; Brener, Sorin J; Skerjanec, Simona; Lansky, Alexandra J; Francese, Dominic P; Dangas, George D; Stone, Gregg W",The American journal of cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjcard.2016.04.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27181566/,825

To investigate whether immune response to the virus can be influenced by genetic factors, we compared HLA and AB0 frequencies in organ transplant recipients and waitlisted patients according to presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed on an Italian cohort composed by transplanted and waitlisted patients in a January 2002-March 2020 time frame. Data from this cohort were merged with the Italian registry of COVID subjects, evaluating infection status of transplanted and waitlisted patients. A total of 56304 cases were studied with the aim of comparing HLA and AB0 frequencies according to the presence (n=265, COVID) or absence (n=56 039, COVID) of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS The cumulative incidence rate of COVID-19 was 0.112% in the Italian population and 0.462% in waitlisted/transplanted patients (OR=4.2, 95%CI [3.7-4.7], P<0.0001). HLA-DRB1*08 was more frequent in COVID (9.7% and 5.2%: OR=1.9, 95%CI [1.2-3.1]; P=0.003; Pc=0.036). In COVID patients, HLA-DRB1*08 was correlated to mortality (6.9% in living vs 17.5% in deceased: OR=2.9, 95%CI [1.15-7.21]; P=0.023). Peptide binding prediction analyses showed that these DRB1*08 alleles were unable to bind any of the viral peptides with high affinity. Lastly, blood group A was more frequent in COVID (45.5%) than COVID patients (39.0%; OR=1.3, 95%CI [1.02-1.66]; P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS Even though preliminary, these results suggest that HLA antigens may influence SARS-CoV-2 infection and clinical evolution of COVID-19 and confirm that blood group A individuals are at greater risk of infection, providing clues on the spread of the disease and indications about infection prognosis and vaccination strategies.","Amoroso, Antonio; Magistroni, Paola; Vespasiano, Francesca; Bella, Antonino; Bellino, Stefania; Puoti, Francesca; Alizzi, Silvia; Vaisitti, Tiziana; Boros, Stefano; Grossi, Paolo Antonio; Trapani, Silvia; Lombardini, Letizia; Pezzotti, Patrizio; Deaglio, Silvia; Brusaferro, Silvio; Cardillo, Massimo",Transplantation,https://doi.org/10.1097/tp.0000000000003507; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141807/,825

We hypothesize that local culture and socioeconomic structure affect our Chinese patients who present with forgetfulness to our memory clinic. METHODS A retrospective case notes review was undertaken on 454 consecutive patients referred to the memory clinic at Princess Margaret Hospital, Hong Kong. RESULTS 385 patients were diagnosed with dementia and 27 had mild cognitive impairment. Reversible dementia was identified in 24 patients and normal cognition in 18. In patients with dementia, 55.8% had Alzheimer's disease, 26.2% had vascular dementia, 6.0% had other irreversible dementia, 5.2% had dementia with Lewy bodies, 4.9% had undetermined dementia and 1.8% had frontotemporal dementia. The median duration from symptom onset to medical consultation was two years; 66.5% had advanced disease with initial Mini-mental State Examination scores < or = 17. On their first visit, 85% of patients were living in the community; after two years this proportion had fallen to 63%.

65442,Medical Student Participation in Otolaryngology Telemedicine Clinic During COVID-19: A Hidden Opportunity.,2020-11-10,"OBJECTIVE To identify individual-, provider- and system/environmental-level barriers and facilitators affecting cardiac rehabilitation (CR) participants' adherence to dietary recommendations. DESIGN A systematic review of the medical literature was conducted. Six databases were searched from inception through March 2021: APA PsycInfo, CINAHL, Embase, Emcare, Medline and PubMed. Only those studies referring to barriers and facilitators reported by CR participants were considered. Pilot and case report studies, non-peer-reviewed literature and studies published in a language other than English, Portuguese or Spanish were excluded. RESULTS Data were extracted and analysed on the basis of individual-, provider- and system/environmental-level factors. Of 2083 initial citations, sixteen studies were included, with nine being qualitative and seven observational in design. From these, ten multi-level barriers and seven multi-level facilitators were identified. Dietary recommendations included developing healthy eating habits, transitioning to vegetarian-rich diets and increasing fish oil and n-3 intake. Only one study reported on all of the nutrition education programme factors recommended by the Workgroup for Intervention Development and Evaluation Research. CONCLUSION To the best of our knowledge, this review is the first to summarise specific barriers and facilitators to recommendation adherence among CR participants. Few of the studies offered any conclusions regarding programme design that could facilitate improved dietary adherence practices. Future studies should aim to explore patient perspectives on the nutritional patterns and recommendations outlined in the Mediterranean Diet, the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension Diet, Vegetarian or Vegan diets and the Portfolio Diet.","Vanzella, Lais Manata; Rouse, Veronica; Ajwani, Fatim; Deilami, Niloufar; Pokosh, Maureen; Oh, Paul; Ghisi, Gabriela Lima de Melo",Public health nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1368980021002962; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34344495/,825

67600,Congratulations 2021.,2021-01-01,"Coronaviruses encode multifunctional proteins that are critical for viral replication and for blocking the innate immune response to viral infection. One such multifunctional domain is the coronavirus papain-like protease (PLP), which processes the viral replicase polyprotein, has deubiquitinating (DUB) activity, and antagonizes the induction of type I interferon (IFN). Here we characterized the DUB and IFN antagonism activities of the PLP domains of human coronavirus NL63 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus to determine if DUB activity mediates interferon antagonism. We found that NL63 PLP2 deconjugated ubiquitin (Ub) and the Ub-line molecule ISG15 from cellular substrates and processed both lysine-48- and lysine-63- linked polyubiquitin chains. This PLP2 DUB activity was dependent on an intact catalytic cysteine residue. We demonstrated that in contrast to PLP2 DUB activity, PLP2-mediated interferon antagonism did not require enzymatic activity. Furthermore, addition of an inhibitor that blocks coronavirus protease/DUB activity did not abrogate interferon antagonism. These results indicated that a component of coronavirus PLP-mediated interferon antagonism was independent of protease and DUB activity. Overall, these results demonstrate the multifunctional nature of the coronavirus PLP domain as a viral protease, DUB, and IFN antagonist and suggest that these independent activities may provide multiple targets for antiviral therapies.","Clementz, Mark A; Chen, Zhongbin; Banach, Bridget S; Wang, Yanhua; Sun, Li; Ratia, Kiira; Baez-Santos, Yahira M; Wang, Jie; Takayama, Jun; Ghosh, Arun K; Li, Kui; Mesecar, Andrew D; Baker, Susan C",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02406-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20181693/,825

A comparison of data obtained from Polish national parks in the 1970s and 1990s showed a significant decrease in the concentrations of heavy metals. In the linear covariability estimation, the t quantile approach was used for multi-element comparison. A number of positive covariabilities were observed. This is a result of anthropogenic activity and the geochemical characteristics of the local environment, including crust composition to which soil composition is related.

We analyzed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients with psoriasis receiving biologic therapy, patients' current status at a single center in Turkey. A total of 133 patients (mean age; 44.6 ± 13.5 years) were on maintenance biological treatment for moderate-to-severe psoriasis during the pandemic. A standardized questionnaire was administered by phone interviews to determine patients' perceptions, attitudes, and adherence to therapy and identify the frequency of COVID-19 infection, psoriasis status, and new comorbidities during the pandemic. All patients had been receiving a biological agent including ustekinumab, etanercept, adalimumab, secukinumab, infliximab, ixekizumab, or certolizumab pegol. Ninety-one patients (68.4%) had at least one comorbid condition, including psoriatic arthritis (35.3%), hypertension (19.5%), diabetes mellitus (16.5%), obesity, coronary artery disease, and dyslipidemia. During the first three months of the pandemic, 52 patients (39%) suspended their biological therapies for short (n=33) or long (n=19) periods without medical advice for reasons of fear, worry, and anxiety. All but one patient restarted their medications as a result of therapeutic counseling. Five patients reported suspicious symptoms, but only one had PCR-confirmed COVID-19. Our findings suggest that biologic treatment for moderate-to-severe psoriasis would not pose an additional risk for COVID-19 infection and its life-threatening complications, even in the presence of a high frequency of cardiometabolic comorbidities, provided that all patients are informed and necessary pandemic-directed precautions are well adopted by the patients.

This study gives comprehensive consideration to these factors by comparing the agreement of voxel-based tissue outcome predictions using acute imaging and clinical parameters with manual lesion segmentations derived from follow-up imaging. This study considers random decision forest, generalized linear model, and k-nearest-neighbor machine learning classifiers in conjunction with three data normalization approaches (non-normalized, relative to contralateral hemisphere, and relative to contralateral VOI), and two data balancing strategies (full dataset and stratified subsampling). These classifier settings were evaluated based on 90 MRI datasets from acute ischemic stroke patients. Distinction was made between patients recanalized using intraarterial and intravenous methods, as well as those without successful recanalization. For primary quantitative comparison, the Dice metric was computed for each voxel-based tissue outcome prediction and its corresponding follow-up lesion segmentation. It was found that the random forest classifier outperformed the generalized linear model and the k-nearest-neighbor classifier, that normalization did not improve the Dice score of the lesion outcome predictions, and that the models generated lesion outcome predictions with higher Dice scores when trained with balanced datasets. No significant difference was found between the treatment groups (intraarterial vs intravenous) regarding the Dice score of the tissue outcome predictions.","Winder, Anthony J; Siemonsen, Susanne; Flottmann, Fabian; Thomalla, Götz; Fiehler, Jens; Forkert, Nils D",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-49460-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31519923/,825

Furthermore, continuing exercise during infectious diseases may lead to prolongation or aggravation of illness with severe acute or chronic organ manifestations. Therefore, even simple infectious diseases require a sufficient period of convalescence and recovery, during which exercise may be not allowed. Nowadays, especially in professional football with high pressures on players, staff and clubs due to broad public interests as well as financial constraints, the return-to-play decision is of utmost significance. Based on previous suggestions and our own experience within amateur and professional athletes and football players, this article aims to give a short overview on return-to-play decisions after common acute infectious diseases in football players.","Scharhag, Jürgen; Meyer, Tim",Journal of sports sciences,https://doi.org/10.1080/02640414.2014.898861; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24784357/,825

74167,Improving Attendance and Patient Experiences During the Expansion of a Telehealth-Based Pediatric Otolaryngology Practice.,2020-10-20,"BACKGROUND The sinus lift was first described in 1974 and it has proven to be a predictable procedure ever since. The complications of this surgical procedure are reported in the literature to be low, and can include acute maxillary sinusitis, scattering of the grafting material into the sinus cavity, wound dehiscence and Schneiderian membrane perforations. We aimed to evaluate the rate of acute maxillary sinusitis after sinus lift procedures and the appropriate management strategies. METHODS Between 2013 and 2015, 245 dental implants were placed in 116 patients (76 males and 40 females) with concomitant bone augmentation of the maxillary sinus floor. The sinus lifting procedure was bilateral in 35 patients and unilateral in 81 patients (a total of 151 sinuses). RESULTS Maxillary sinusitis occurred in 5 patients (4.3 %). The clinical signs of infection were: headache, locoregional pain, cacosmia, inflammation of the oral buccal mucosa and rhinorrhea or unilateral nasal discharge. A mucosal fistula was observed during inspection in one patient. The management included only the removal of the grafting material in 3 patients, in 1 patient the grafting material was removed together with all the implants, and in 1 patient only 2 implants and the grafting material were removed, 1 implant being left in place. The sinus cavity was irrigated with metronidazole solution and antibiotic therapy with clindamycin and metronidazole was prescribed for 10 days. Subsequently, all signs of infection disappeared within 5 to 7 days and normal sinus function and drainage were restored. CONCLUSIONS Although sinus lift is regarded as a safe and reliable procedure, acute sinusitis is a possible complication which has to be managed immediately in order to reduce the risk of further complications like pansinusitis, osteomyelitis of the maxillary bone, and spreading of the infection in the infratemporal space or orbital cavity. To minimize risk, caution must be taken with all the steps of the procedure, in order not to obliterate the ostium, impairing maxillary sinus clearance.","Chirilă, Lucian; Rotaru, Cristian; Filipov, Iulian; Săndulescu, Mihai",BMC infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-016-1398-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27169511/,825

METHODS This prospective study included 45 patients who were hospitalized for confirmed COVID-19. Nasopharyngeal swab samples were obtained from the patients before hospitalization. Only one eye of each patient was randomly selected for-conjunctival sampling. All participants underwent a complete slit-lamp examination. Conjunctival and nasopharyngeal swab samples were analyzed by reversetranscriptase-polymerase-chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS Twenty seven (60%) of the patients were male and 18 (40%) were female. Conjunctival swab was positive in only one (2.22%) patient. None of the COVID-19 patients showed ocular changes and symptoms. There were no abnormalities of the ocular surface, anterior chamber or posterior segment at slit-lamp examination. CONCLUSIONS The RT-PCR was not high positive in the conjunctiva as in nasopharyngeal swabs.

75910,Monopolar cautery and adverse effects on cochlear implants.,2013,"PURPOSE To compare the patency rates and clinical outcomes of balloon angioplasty vs. nitinol stent placement for patients with short (≤150 mm) as compared to long (>150 mm) femoropopliteal (FP) occlusive lesions. METHODS Between 2006 and 2011, 254 patients (134 men; mean age 68 years) underwent FP angioplasty. The majority of patients (64%) were treated for critical limb ischemia. One hundred thirty-nine (55%) patients had short FP lesions ≤150 mm, while 115 patients had long FP lesions >150 mm. The mean lesion length was 78±43 mm in the short FP lesion group and 254±58 mm in the long FP lesion group. Duplex ultrasound follow-up with a peak systolic velocity ratio ≥2.0 was used to define restenosis. RESULTS The overall procedure success rate was 98%. One hundred forty-eight (58%) patients underwent stent placement. The mean number of stents deployed for treatment of short FP lesions was 1.0±0.4 vs. 2.0±0.7 for long FP lesions (p<0.001). The primary patency rate of short FP lesions treated with balloon angioplasty vs. stenting was 66% vs. 63% at 1 year (p=0.7). For long FP lesions, the 1-year primary patency rates of balloon angioplasty vs. stenting were 34% vs. 49% (p=0.006). Balloon angioplasty of long FP lesions was also associated with significantly lower assisted primary and secondary patency compared to stenting (p<0.05 for all comparisons). Sustained clinical improvement was >90% at 30 days but declined to 62% to 75% at 1 year. CONCLUSION Balloon angioplasty and stent placement result in similar patency rates and clinical outcomes for shorter to medium-length FP lesions. In comparison, stent placement in long FP lesions is associated with superior outcomes to balloon angioplasty, even when multiple stents are required. Procedure success and clinical improvement can be achieved in the majority of patients, but rates of restenosis remain high.","Armstrong, Ehrin J; Saeed, Haseeb; Alvandi, Bejan; Singh, Satinder; Singh, Gagan D; Yeo, Khung Keong; Anderson, David; Westin, Gregory G; Dawson, David L; Pevec, William C; Laird, John R",Journal of endovascular therapy : an official journal of the International Society of Endovascular Specialists,https://doi.org/10.1583/13-4399mr.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24502482/,825
76607,COVID-19 Preprocedural Testing: What About the False Positives?,2021-02-09,"BACKGROUND Supporting underrepresented groups in pursuing, applying and matriculating into medical education is a key issue in the field. In the United Kingdom, Gateway to Medicine programmes were created as a specific form of entry to medical education, to support diversification goals. Whilst well-established, how these programmes are broadly designed and implemented, and how their functioning links to conceptual views of diversity, is not well described in the literature. METHODS This article explores relevant diversity-related literature, including a specific review of all Gateway programmes. FINDINGS Key facets of diversity-related work in medicine, including the distinction between 'widening participation' and 'widening access' are discussed. These distinctions frame the presentation of Gateway years; their selection process, structure and function are described. The purpose of these years is then discussed, with the lens of different discourses around diversity in medicine, to provide theoretical and practical considerations. Recommendations for how faculty can better explore diversity-related issues are also provided. CONCLUSION Gateway programmes may be effective, to some extent, in widening access to medical education, but require considerable resourcing to operate. Though heterogenous in nature, these programmes share common elements. However, discourses around the goals and purpose of this diversification vary based on individuals and institutions. These varied perspectives, as well as the societal and historical implications of diversity-related work, are important for all clinical educators to understand with depth, and address directly, in order to reduce inequalities both within medical education and society at large.","Dueñas, Angelique N; Tiffin, Paul A; Finn, Gabrielle M",The clinical teacher,https://doi.org/10.1111/tct.13368; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34002491/,825

This behavior has been exploited in the production of gel particles that range between approximately 100 and 4000 µm in diameter. Here, we investigate their performance as materials for the encapsulation and release of the aromatic oil cymene. The gel particles ( 1500 µm in diameter) are prepared by dropwise addition of an oil-in-water suspension made of cymene droplets dispersed in a viscous solution of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and ,,-trimethylammonium derivatized hydroxyethyl cellulose (JR-400) to a gelling solution of excess SDS. The release of cymene into aqueous (5 wt.% SDS and 4 wt.% pentanol in water) and organic (isooctane) solutions is measured using UV-VIS spectroscopy and analyzed with the shrinking core model. The experimental data and model analysis indicate that the release rate is determined by the effective diffusivity and solubility of the oil in the aqueous gel matrix, both of which depend on the presence of surfactant in the receiving solution, and the swelling of the gel particle.","Lapitsky, Yakov; Kaler, Eric W",Soft matter,https://doi.org/10.1039/b607910e; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680218/,825

We describe the feasibility and interim outcome of implementing a modified imaging algorithm for COVID-19 risk stratification across a regional network of primary stroke centers in the work-up of acute ischemic stroke referrals for time-critical mechanical thrombectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS We undertook a retrospective review of 49 patients referred to the regional neuroscience unit for consideration of mechanical thrombectomy between April 14, 2020, and May 21, 2020. During this time, all referring units followed a standard imaging protocol that included a chest CT in addition to a head CT and CT angiogram to identify Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infective pulmonary changes. RESULTS Overall, 2 patients had typical COVID-19 radiologic features and tested positive, while 7 patients had indeterminate imaging findings and tested negative. The others had normal or atypical changes and were not diagnosed with or suspected of having COVID-19. There was an overall sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 74.1%, negative predictive value of 100%, and positive predictive value of 22.2% when using chest CT to diagnose COVID-19 in comparison with the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction test. The mean additional time and radiation dose incurred for the chest CT were 184 ± 65.5 seconds and 2.47 ± 1.03 mSv. Multiple cardiovascular and pulmonary incidental findings of clinical relevance were identified in our patient population. CONCLUSIONS Chest CT provides a pragmatic, rapid additional tool for COVID-19 risk stratification among patients referred for mechanical thrombectomy. Its inclusion in a standardized regional stroke imaging protocol has enabled efficient use of hospital resources with minimal compromise or delay to the overall patient treatment schedule.","Dhillon, P S; Pointon, K; Lenthall, R; Nair, S; Subramanian, G; McConachie, N; Izzath, W",AJNR.

TRAF6 belongs to the tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor family and has been demonstrated to be involved in tumor progression in various cancers. However, the exact effect of TRAF6 on gastric cancer stem cells has not been extensively studied. In this study, abnormal expression of TRAF6 was found in gastric cancer tissues. Overexpression of TRAF6 enhanced proliferation and migration, and TRAF6 knockdown reversed this phenomenon in gastric cancer cells. Moreover, TRAF6 may inhibit differentiation and promote stemness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Transcriptome profiles revealed 701 differentially expressed genes in the wild-type group and the TRAF6 knockout group. Potential molecules associated with cell proliferation and migration were identified, including MAPK, FOXO, and IL-17. In conclusion, TRAF6 is a significant factor promoting proliferation and migration in gastric cancer cells and may provide a new target for the accurate treatment of gastric cancer.","Yang, Mengting; Jin, Meng; Li, Kailong; Liu, Haifeng; Yang, Xiaxia; Zhang, Xiaobei; Zhang, Bin; Gong, Aihua; Bie, Qingli",Stem cells international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/3296192; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32724313/,825

Here, we tested a panel of PPMO designed to target conserved sequences in the RNA genome segments encoding polymerase subunits of a highly pathogenic mouse-adapted influenza A virus (SC35M; H7N7). Three PPMO, targeting the translation start site region of PB1 or NP mRNA or the 3'-terminal region of NP viral RNA (vRNA), potently inhibited virus replication in MDCK cells. Primer extension assays showed that treatment with any of the effective PPMO led to markedly reduced levels of mRNA, cRNA and vRNA. Initially, the potential toxicity of a range of intranasally administered PPMO doses was evaluated, by measuring their effect on body weight of uninfected mice. Subsequently, a non-toxic dosing regimen was used to investigate the effect of various PPMO on SC35M infection in a mouse model. Mice administered intranasal treatment of PPMO targeting the PB1-AUG region or NP vRNA, at 3 mug per dose, given once 3 h before and once 2 days after intranasal infection with 10xLD(50) of SC35M, showed a 2 log(10) reduction of viral titre in the lungs and 50 % survival for the 16 day duration of the experiment, whereas the NP-AUG-targeted PPMO treatment resulted in 30 % survival of an otherwise lethal infection. These data suggest that PPMO provide a useful reagent to investigate influenza virus molecular biology and may constitute a therapeutic strategy against highly pathogenic influenza viruses.","Gabriel, Gülsah; Nordmann, Alexandra; Stein, David A; Iversen, Patrick L; Klenk, Hans-Dieter",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/vir.0.83449-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18343835/,825

Experiments were conducted in a pilot-scale 24 m(3) stainless steel chamber using either biological indicators (BIs) or bacterial spores deposited onto surfaces via aerosolization. Wipe sampling was used to recover aerosol-deposited spores from chamber surfaces and coupon materials before and after fogging to assess decontamination efficacy. Temperature, relative humidity, and hydrogen peroxide vapor levels were measured during testing to characterize the fog environment. The fog completely inactivated all BIs in a test using a 60 mL solution of PAA (22% hydrogen peroxide/4.5% peracetic acid). In tests using aerosol-deposited bacterial spores, the majority of the post-fogging spore levels per sample were less than 1 log colony forming units, with a number of samples having no detectable spores. In terms of decontamination efficacy, a 4.78 log reduction of viable spores was achieved on wood and stainless steel. Fogging of PAA solutions shows potential as a relatively easy to use decontamination technology in the event of contamination with Bacillus anthracis or other spore-forming infectious disease agents, although additional research is needed to enhance sporicidal efficacy.","Wood, Joseph P; Calfee, Michael Worth; Clayton, Matthew; Griffin-Gatchalian, Nicole; Touati, Abderrahmane; Egler, Kim",Journal of hazardous materials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2013.01.068; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23434480/,825

The aim of this study is to assess the results of rectovaginal fistula repair and identify predictive factors for poor outcome. METHODS Retrospective analysis of patients who underwent rectovaginal fistula repair from 1988 to 2008 was performed. chi tests and logistical regression analysis were used to study treatment outcomes according to the following fistula characteristics: etiology, size, location, and number of prior attempts at fistula repair. In addition, patient factors such as age, body mass index, smoking history, comorbid condition of diabetes, use of steroid and immunosuppressive medications, number of prior vaginal deliveries, and presence of a diverting stoma were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 184 procedures were performed in 125 patients. Inflammatory bowel disease was the most common indication for surgery (45.6%), followed by obstetric injury (24%) and surgical trauma (16%). The mean duration of fistula presence was 31.2 months. The procedures performed included endorectal advancement flap (35.3%), gracilis muscle interposition (13.6%), seton placement (13.6%), and transperineal (8.7%) and transvaginal repair (8.1%). The overall success rate per procedure was 60%, with no difference in recurrence rates based on the type of repair. Patients with Crohn's disease had more recurrent fistulas (44.2% success per procedure; P < .01), although 78% eventually healed after an average of 1.8 procedures. Patients with obstetric injuries had an 89% success rate after an average of 1.3 procedures per patient, which is similar to the success rate for traumatic fistulas. Pouch vaginal fistulas had a 91% success rate after an average of 1.6 procedures per patient. The overall success rate per patient was 88% after multiple procedures with a mean follow-up of 16.3 months. Age, body mass index, diabetes, use of steroids and immunosuppressive agents, size and location of the fistula, number of vaginal deliveries, time interval between a recurrent episode and subsequent repair, and the presence of fecal diversion did not affect outcomes. The presence of Crohn's disease and a smoking history are strongly associated with rectovaginal fistula recurrence (P = .02). CONCLUSIONS Despite a relatively low initial success rate (60%), most rectovaginal fistulas can be successfully repaired with subsequent operations. Crohn's disease and smoking are associated with adverse outcomes.","Pinto, Rodrigo A; Peterson, Thais V; Shawki, Sherief; Davila, G Willy; Wexner, Steven D",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1007/dcr.0b013e3181e536cb; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20706066/,825

The overall prognosis of shoulder pain is highly variable with 40% of patients reporting persistent pain 1 year after consulting their primary care clinician. Despite evidence for prognostic value of a range of patient and disease characteristics, it is not clear whether these factors also predict (moderate) the effect of specific treatments (such as corticosteroid injection, exercise, or surgery). Objectives This study aims to identify predictors of treatment effect (i.e. treatment moderators or effect modifiers) by investigating the association between a number of pre-defined individual-level factors and the effects of commonly used treatments on shoulder pain and disability outcomes. Methods This will be a meta-analysis using individual participant data (IPD). Eligible trials investigating the effectiveness of advice and analgesics, corticosteroid injection, physiotherapy-led exercise, psychological interventions, and/or surgical treatment in patients with shoulder conditions will be identified from systematic reviews and an updated systematic search for trials, and risk of bias will be assessed. Authors of all eligible trials will be approached for data sharing. Outcomes measured will be shoulder pain and disability, and our previous work has identified candidate predictors. The main analysis will be conducted using hierarchical one-stage IPD meta-analysis models, examining the effect of treatment-predictor interaction on outcome for each of the candidate predictors and describing relevant subgroup effects where significant interaction effects are detected. Random effects will be used to account for clustering and heterogeneity. Sensitivity analyses will be based on (i) exclusion of trials at high risk of bias, (ii) use of restricted cubic splines to model potential non-linear associations for candidate predictors measured on a continuous scale, and (iii) the use of a two-stage IPD meta-analysis framework. Discussion Our study will collate, appraise, and synthesise IPD from multiple studies to examine potential predictors of treatment effect in order to assess the potential for better and more efficient targeting of specific treatments for individuals with shoulder pain.

The underlying mechanisms controlling water film growth are, however, misunderstood. Using infrared nanospectroscopy, amplitude-modulated atomic force microscopy, and molecular simulations, we show how water films grow from water vapor on hydrophilic mineral nanoparticles. We imaged films with up to four water layers that grow anisotropically over a single face. Growth usually begins from the near edges of a face where defects preferentially capture water vapor. Thicker films produced by condensation cooling completely engulf nanoparticles and form thicker menisci over defects. The high surface tension of water smooths film surfaces and produces films of inhomogeneous thickness. Nanoscale topography and film surface energy thereby control anisotropic distributions and thicknesses of water films on hydrophilic mineral nanoparticles.","Yalcin, Sibel Ebru; Legg, Benjamin A; Yeşilbaş, Merve; Malvankar, Nikhil S; Boily, Jean-François",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aaz9708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832658/,825

METHODS We randomized 13 199 patients with a noncardioembolic, nonsevere ischemic stroke or high-risk transient ischemic attack to ticagrelor (180 mg loading dose on day 1 followed by 90 mg twice daily for days 2-90) or aspirin (300 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily for days 2-90) within 24 hours of symptom onset. In all patients, investigators informed on the presence of ipsilateral stenosis ≥50%, small deep infarct <15 mm, and on cardiac source of embolism detected after enrollment or rare causes, which allowed to construct an ESUS category in all other patients with documented brain infarction. The primary end point was the time to the occurrence of stroke, myocardial infarction, or death within 90 days. RESULTS ESUS was identified in 4329 (32.8%) patients. There was no treatment-by-ESUS category interaction (P=0.83). Hazard ratio in ESUS patients was 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.68-1.10; P=0.24). However, hazard ratio was 0.51 (95% confidence interval, 0.29-0.90; P=0.02) in ESUS patients with ipsilateral stenosis <50% or aortic arch atherosclerosis (n=961) and 0.98 (95% confidence interval, 0.76-1.27; P=0.89) in the remaining ESUS patients (n=3368; P for heterogeneity =0.04). CONCLUSIONS In this post hoc, exploratory analysis, we found no treatment-by-ESUS category interaction. ESUS subgroups have heterogeneous response to treatment (Funded by AstraZeneca).

Even today, the chemical is produced in large quantities and the threat of a large-scale leak is ever-present from industrial accidents or terrorist attacks. The criteria to assess and manage chlorine gas-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome are likely to be the same as for other causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation can be used successfully.","Harischandra, Tolusha; Withanaarachchi, Kapilani; Piyasiri, Bhagya; Wickramasuriya, Hesaru; Piyasiri, Gihan; Firmin, Richard",Perfusion,https://doi.org/10.1177/0267659120922013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32441230/,825
87519,Otolaryngology Match Trends: Considerations for Proper Data Interpretation.,2020-07-14,"PURPOSE Laparoscopic total gastrectomy (LTG) is more complicated than laparoscopic distal gastrectomy, especially during a surgeon's initial experience with the technique. In this study, we evaluated the short-term outcomes of and learning curve for LTG during the initial cases of a single surgeon compared with those of open total gastrectomy (OTG). MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 2009 and 2013, 134 OTG and 74 LTG procedures were performed by a single surgeon who was experienced with OTG but new to performing LTG. Clinical characteristics, operative parameters, and short-term postoperative outcomes were compared between groups. RESULTS Advanced gastric cancer and D2 lymph node dissection were more common in the OTG than LTG group. Although the operation time was significantly longer for LTG than for OTG (175.7±43.1 minutes vs. 217.5±63.4 minutes), LTG seems to be slightly superior or similar to OTG in terms of postoperative recovery measures. The operation time moving average of 15 cases in the LTG group decreased gradually, and the curve flattened at 54 cases. The postoperative complication rate was similar for the two groups (11.9% vs. 13.5%). No anastomotic or stump leaks occurred. CONCLUSIONS Although LTG is technically difficult and operation time is longer for surgeons experienced in open surgery, it can be performed safely, even during a surgeon's early experience with the technique. Considering the benefits of minimally invasive surgery, LTG is recommended for early gastric cancer.","Song, Jeong Ho; Choi, Yoon Young; An, Ji Yeong; Kim, Dong Wook; Hyung, Woo Jin; Noh, Sung Hoon",Journal of gastric cancer,https://doi.org/10.5230/jgc.2015.15.3.159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26468413/,825

The ethanol extract of the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia showed high activity against the SARS-CoV PLpro with an IC50 of value of 15 µg/ml. Due to its potency, subsequent bioactivity-guided fractionation of the ethanol extract led to six aromatic compounds (1-6), which were identified as bavachinin (1), neobavaisoflavone (2), isobavachalcone (3), 4'-O-methylbavachalcone (4), psoralidin (5) and corylifol A (6). All isolated flavonoids (1-6) inhibited PLpro in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 ranging between 4.2 and 38.4 µM. Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plots and their secondary replots indicated that inhibitors (1-6) were mixed inhibitors of PLpro. The analysis of KI and KIS values proved that the two most promising compounds (3 and 5) had reversible mixed type I mechanisms.","Kim, Dae Wook; Seo, Kyung Hye; Curtis-Long, Marcus J; Oh, Kyeong Yeol; Oh, Jong-Won; Cho, Jung Keun; Lee, Kon Ho; Park, Ki Hun",Journal of enzyme inhibition and medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.3109/14756366.2012.753591; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23323951/,825

We aimed to comprehensively synthesise health economic evidence regarding bariatric surgery from 1995 to 2018 (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42018094189). Meta-analyses were conducted to calculate the annual cost changes ""before"" and ""after"" surgery, and cumulative cost differences between surgical and nonsurgical groups. An updated narrative review also summarized the full and partial health economic evaluations of surgery from September 2015. N = 101 studies were eligible for the qualitative analyses since 1995, with n = 24 studies after September 2015. Quality of reporting has increased, and the inclusion of complications/reoperations was predominantly contained in the full economic evaluations after September 2015. Technical improvements in surgery were also reflected across the studies. Sixty-one studies were eligible for the quantitative meta-analyses. Compared with no/conventional treatment, surgery was cost saving over a lifetime scenario. Additionally, consideration of indirect costs through sensitivity analyses increased cost savings. Medication cost savings were dominant in the before versus after meta-analysis. Overall, bariatric surgery is cost saving over the life course even without considering indirect costs. Health economists are hearing the call to present higher quality studies and include the costs of complications/reoperations; however, indirect costs and body contouring surgery are still not appropriately considered.","Xia, Qing; Campbell, Julie A; Ahmad, Hasnat; Si, Lei; de Graaff, Barbara; Palmer, Andrew J",Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,https://doi.org/10.1111/obr.12932; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31733033/,825

A simple and relatively easy technique to perform a safe transection of rectum is presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS The extracorporeal ligation of the rectum just proximal to the cut end of the rectum before applying the linear stapling stapler facilitates the procedure and requires only a few firings of the stapler during the laparoscopic rectal resections. RESULTS Ten patients with a median age of 72 years underwent rectal transection with this technique. The procedure was performed with a single 60-mm cartridge in 3 patients, and two firings of the Endo GIA™ (Covidien LLC, Mansfield, MA) with a 45-mm cartridge were necessary for cross-stapling at the level of the pelvic floor in the remaining patients. There were no intraoperative complications. Postoperative complications were seen in 2 patients. CONCLUSIONS This simple technique theoretically seems safer than the conventional approach and should be considered as an additional option for rectal transection.","Bulut, Orhan",Journal of laparoendoscopic & advanced surgical techniques.

OBJECTIVE To review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) testing eHealth interventions designed to improve adherence to topical antipsoriatics and to review applications for smartphones (apps) incorporating the word psoriasis. MATERIAL AND METHODS Literature review: Medline, Embase, Cochrane, PsycINFO and Web of Science were searched using search terms for eHealth, psoriasis and topical antipsoriatics. General analysis of apps: The operating systems (OS) for smartphones, iOS, Google Play, Microsoft Store, Symbian OS and Blackberry OS were searched for apps containing the word psoriasis. RESULTS Literature review: Only one RCT was included, reporting on psoriasis patients' Internet reporting their status of psoriasis over a 12-month period. The rate of adherence was measured by Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS®). An improvement in medical adherence and reduction of severity of psoriasis were reported. General analysis of apps: A total 184 apps contained the word psoriasis.

The impetus for this has been the desire to improve the safety, efficiency, and synchrony of ventilator-patient interaction. Unfortunately, the proliferation of names for ventilation modes has made understanding mode capabilities problematic. New modes are generally based on increasingly sophisticated closed-loop control systems or targeting schemes. We describe the 6 basic targeting schemes used in commercially available ventilators today: set-point, dual, servo, adaptive, optimal, and intelligent. These control systems are designed to serve the 3 primary goals of mechanical ventilation: safety, comfort, and liberation. The basic operations of these schemes may be understood by clinicians without any engineering background, and they provide the basis for understanding the wide variety of ventilation modes and their relative advantages for improving patient-ventilator synchrony. Conversely, their descriptions may provide engineers with a means to better communicate to end users.","Chatburn, Robert L; Mireles-Cabodevila, Eduardo",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.00967; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21235841/,825
89464,Salivary Duct Carcinoma of the Parotid: Outcomes with a Contemporary Multidisciplinary Treatment Approach.,2016,"BACKGROUND Vaccination programs are essential for the containment of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected hemodialysis populations especially hard. Early reports suggest a reduced immunologic response to SARS-Cov-2 vaccines in dialysis patients, in spite of a high degree of seroconversion. We aimed to identify risk factors for a reduced efficacy of an mRNA vaccine in a cohort of hemodialysis patients. METHOD In a multicenter study, including 294 Portuguese hemodialysis patients who had received 2 doses of BNT162b2 with a three week interval, IgG-class antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein were determined 3 weeks after the first dose (M1) and 6 weeks after the second dose (M2). The threshold for seroconversion was 10UR/mL. Demographic and clinical data was retrieved from a quality registry. Adverse events were registered using a questionnaire. RESULTS At M2, seroconversion was 93.1% with a median antibody level of 197.5U/mL (1.2-3237.0) and a median increase of 180.0U/mL (-82.9-2244.6) from M1. Age (beta -8.9; 95%CI: -12.88 to -4.91; P < 0.0001), ferritin > 600ng/mL (beta 183.93; 95%CI: 74.75 to 293.10; P = 0.001) and physical activity (beta 265.79; 95%CI: 30.7 to 500.88; P = 0.03) were independent predictors of SARS-Cov-2 antibody levels after two vaccine doses. Plasma albumin > 3.5g/dL independently predicted the increase of antibody levels between both doses (OR 14.72; 95%CI: 1.38 to 157.45; P = 0.03). Only mild adverse reactions were observed in 10.9% of patients. CONCLUSIONS The SARS-Cov-2 vaccine BNT162b2 is safe and effective in hemodialysis patients. Besides age, iron status and nutrition are possible modifiable modulators of the immunologic response to SARS-Cov-2 mRNA vaccines. This data suggests the need for an early identification of populations at higher risk for diminished antibody production and the potential advantage of the implementation of oriented strategies to maximize the immune response to vaccination in these patients.","Santos-Araújo, Carla; Veiga, Pedro Mota; Santos, Mário João; Santos, Lidia; Romãozinho, Catarina; Silva, Mónica; Lucas, Carlos; Duarte, Mary Luz; Haarhaus, Mathias; Haase, Michael; Macário, Fernando","Nephrology, dialysis, transplantation : official publication of the European Dialysis and Transplant Association - European Renal Association",https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfab293; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34634116/,825

It is a priority to produce data both rapidly and accurately in order to identify current therapies that can be repurposed to offer protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection. As healthcare workers are both at high risk for infection and able to be readily diagnosed, they offer a potential wealth of data to be analyzed. A systematic data analysis of exposure and infection rates among healthcare workers could yield patterns identifying common protective factors, such as medications with prophylactic potential against SARS-CoV-2, that can be fast-tracked into available therapies.

Although an ASFV p72 gene based real-time PCR assay (a.k.a. the Zsak assay) (Zsak et al. J. Clinical Microbiology, 43, 2005, 112) has been widely used for ASFV detection, several more ASFV sequences have become available in the 15 years since the design of the Zsak assay. In this study, we developed a new ASFV p72 gene based real-time PCR after analysis of all currently available sequences of the p72 gene and multiplexed the new assay with a modified Zsak assay aiming to have a broader coverage of ASFV strain/isolates. To reduce false negative detections, porcine house-keeping gene, beta actin (ACTB), was applied as an internal control. Eight ACTB sequences from the GenBank and 61 partial ACTB sequences generated in this study, and 1,012 p72 sequences from the GenBank and 23 p72 sequences generated at FADDL, were used for ACTB and ASFV primer and probe designs, respectively, to ensure broader host and ASFV coverage. Multiplexing ACTB in the reaction did not inhibit ASFV amplification. The multiplex assay was evaluated for strain/isolate coverage, sensitivity and specificity. The in silico analysis showed high ASFV strain/isolate coverage: 98.4% (978/994) of all p72 sequences currently available. The limit of detection (LOD) was 6 plasmid copies or 0.1-1 TCID50 /ml of ASFV isolates per reaction. Only targeted ASFV isolates and the viruses in the positive clinical samples were detected, indicating that the assay is highly specific (100% specificity). The test results of 26 ASFV isolates with different country origins showed that this newly developed multiplex assay performed better than the Zsak assay that has been widely accepted and used worldwide, indicating that it may be used as an alternative assay for ASFV detection.","Wang, Yin; Xu, Lizhe; Noll, Lance; Stoy, Colin; Porter, Elizabeth; Fu, Jingping; Feng, Yuan; Peddireddi, Lalitha; Liu, Xuming; Dodd, Kimberly A; Jia, Wei; Bai, Jianfa",Transboundary and emerging diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.13582; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32306531/,825

METHODS The authors conducted a retrospective review of all wound care consultations over 1 year at The New Jewish Home, a 514-bed academically affiliated facility in an urban setting. Investigators analyzed residents by age, sex, type of wound, presence of infection, and whether the resident was PA or LTC. Authors designated PIs as facility acquired or present on admission. RESULTS During the study period, 190 wound care consultations were requested; 74.7% of consults were for those in PA care. The average patient age was 76.3 years, and there were 1.7 wounds per resident receiving consultation. Of studied wounds, 53.2% were PIs, 15.8% surgical, 6.8% arterial, 6.3% soft tissue injury, 5.8% venous, 2.6% malignant wounds, and 2.1% diabetic ulcers; however, 11.6% of residents receiving consults had more than one wound type. In this sample, 13.2% of residents had infected wounds, and 76.2% of PIs were present on admission. CONCLUSIONS The wide variety of wounds in this sample reflects the medical complexity of this population. The transformation of LTC into a PA environment has altered the epidemiology of chronic wounds and increased demand for wound care expertise. These results challenge traditional perceptions of wound care centered on PIs. Given its importance, a wound care skill set should be required of all PA/LTC providers.","Levine, Jeffrey M; Brandeis, Gary; Namagiri, Santhini; Spinner, Ruth",Advances in skin & wound care,https://doi.org/10.1097/01.asw.0000755932.27249.54; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34260419/,825

However, much less is known about palpitations than other menopausal symptoms such as vasomotor symptoms. The objective of this review was to integrate evidence on menopausal palpitations measures. Keyword searching was done in PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO for English-language, descriptive articles containing data on menopause and palpitations and meeting other pre-specified inclusion criteria. Of 670 articles, 110 met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Results showed that 11 different measures were used across articles, with variability within and between measures. Inconsistencies in the wording of measurement items, recall periods, and response options were observed even when standardized measures were used. Most measures were limited to assessing symptom presence and severity.

Objective To quantitatively describe SARS-CoV-2 molecular viral shedding in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Design, Setting, and Participants A retrospective evaluation was conducted for a cohort of 303 symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection between March 6 and March 26, 2020. Participants were isolated in a community treatment center in Cheonan, Republic of Korea. Main Outcomes and Measures Epidemiologic, demographic, and laboratory data were collected and analyzed. Attending health care personnel carefully identified patients' symptoms during isolation. The decision to release an individual from isolation was based on the results of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay from upper respiratory tract specimens (nasopharynx and oropharynx swab) and lower respiratory tract specimens (sputum) for SARS-CoV-2. This testing was performed on days 8, 9, 15, and 16 of isolation. On days 10, 17, 18, and 19, RT-PCR assays from the upper or lower respiratory tract were performed at physician discretion. Cycle threshold (Ct) values in RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 detection were determined in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Results Of the 303 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, the median (interquartile range) age was 25 (22-36) years, and 201 (66.3%) were women. Only 12 (3.9%) patients had comorbidities (10 had hypertension, 1 had cancer, and 1 had asthma). Among the 303 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 193 (63.7%) were symptomatic at the time of isolation. Of the 110 (36.3%) asymptomatic patients, 21 (19.1%) developed symptoms during isolation. The median (interquartile range) interval of time from detection of SARS-CoV-2 to symptom onset in presymptomatic patients was 15 (13-20) days. The proportions of participants with a negative conversion at day 14 and day 21 from diagnosis were 33.7% and 75.2%, respectively, in asymptomatic patients and 29.6% and 69.9%, respectively, in symptomatic patients (including presymptomatic patients). The median (SE) time from diagnosis to the first negative conversion was 17 (1.07) days for asymptomatic patients and 19.5 (0.63) days for symptomatic (including presymptomatic) patients (P = .07). The Ct values for the envelope (env) gene from lower respiratory tract specimens showed that viral loads in asymptomatic patients from diagnosis to discharge tended to decrease more slowly in the time interaction trend than those in symptomatic (including presymptomatic) patients (β = -0.065 [SE, 0.023]; P = .005). Conclusions and Relevance In this cohort study of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were isolated in a community treatment center in Cheonan, Republic of Korea, the Ct values in asymptomatic patients were similar to those in symptomatic patients.

Its physiopathology remains unknown, and there is no consensus on optimal management. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of electromagnetic-focused extracorporeal shockwave treatment (F-ESWT) in patients with GTPS. METHODS This multicenter clinical trial included 103 patients with chronic GTPS randomly assigned to the treatment group, consisting of electromagnetic F-ESWT and a specific exercise protocol, or the control group, receiving sham F-ESWT and the same exercise protocol. Both groups were treated with 3 weekly sessions; the F-ESWT group received an energy flux density of 0.20 mJ/mm, whereas the control group received 0.01 mJ/mm. Patients were assessed at baseline and 1, 2, 3, and 6 months after treatment. A visual analogue scale (VAS) score for pain at 2 months was the primary outcome. The Harris hip score (HHS), Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), EuroQoL-5 Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D), and Roles and Maudsley score were used as secondary outcomes. Complications were recorded. RESULTS The mean VAS score decreased from 6.3 at baseline in both groups to 2.0 in the F-ESWT group versus 4.7 in the control group at 2 months; the 2-month score differed significantly between groups (p < 0.001). All secondary outcomes at all follow-up intervals were significantly better in the F-ESWT group, except for the LEFS score at 1 month after treatment (p = 0.25). No complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS F-ESWT in association with a specific exercise program is safe and effective for GTPS, with a success rate of 86.8% at 2 months after treatment, which was maintained until the end of follow-up.

96814,A Cost-effective Solution to Limit Aerosol Transmission of Infectious Agents During Mastoid Drilling.,2020-08-27,"Combining microfluidic devices with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has the potential of unlocking their vast sample handling and processing operation space for use with the powerful analytics provided by NMR. One particularly challenging class of integrated functional elements from the perspective of NMR are conductive structures. Metallic electrodes could be used for electrochemical sample interaction for example, yet they can cause severe NMR spectral and SNR degradation. These issues are more entangled at the micro-scale since the distorted volume occupies a higher ratio of the sample volume. In this study, a combination of simulation and experimental validation was used to identify an electrode geometry that, in terms of NMR spectral parameters, performs as well as for the case when no electrodes are present. By placing the metal tracks in the side-walls of a microfluidic channel, we found that NMR RF excitation performance was actually enhanced, without compromising B0 homogeneity. Monitoring in situ deposition of chitosan in the microfluidic platform is presented as a proof-of-concept demonstration of NMR characterisation of an electrochemical process.","Davoodi, Hossein; Nordin, Nurdiana; Bordonali, Lorenzo; Korvink, Jan G; MacKinnon, Neil; Badilita, Vlad",Lab on a chip,https://doi.org/10.1039/d0lc00364f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734975/,825
98126,Comparison of Frenotomy Techniques for the Treatment of Ankyloglossia in Children: A Systematic Review.,2020-06-02,"BACKGROUND HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has been rapidly implemented in Australia, initially through restricted access in demonstration studies, and then through prescribing across sexual health clinics and general practice settings. In 2018, PrEP was publicly subsidised for people with Medicare (universal health insurance for citizens, permanent residents and those from countries with reciprocal arrangements). There is little research examining the experiences of PrEP providers in Australia, and existing research has been primarily conducted before public subsidy. METHODS In this qualitative study, we examine the challenges that have emerged for PrEP-providing clinicians after public subsidy for PrEP was introduced. We conducted 28 semi-structured interviews in 2019-20 with PrEP providers in two Australian states, and analysed data thematically. Participants included general practitioners (GPs), sexual health nurses and sexual health physicians. RESULTS Sexual health services have been reconfigured to meet changing patient demand, with an emphasis on ensuring equitable financial access to PrEP. Restrictions to nurse-led PrEP frustrated some participants, given that nurses had demonstrated competence during trials. GPs were believed to be less effective at prescribing PrEP, but GP participants themselves indicated that PrEP was an easy intervention, but difficult to integrate into general practice. Participants expressed discomfort with on-demand PrEP. CONCLUSIONS Our findings indicate that supporting ways for patients without Medicare to access PrEP inexpensively, advocating for nurse-led PrEP, and developing guidelines adapted to general practice consultations could ensure that PrEP is delivered more effectively and equitably. Additionally, PrEP providers require encouragement to build confidence in providing on-demand PrEP.","Smith, Anthony K J; Haire, Bridget; Newman, Christy E; Holt, Martin",Sexual health,https://doi.org/10.1071/sh20208; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33906719/,825

It has also affected medical education and clinical training, and forced medical schools to switch over to online mode of teaching. The aim of this study was to learn about the experience and perception of undergraduate students regarding online teaching. Methods: This is a cross sectional observational study conducted among the undergraduate students of Hamdard Institute of Medical Sciences and Research, New Delhi, India. A validated electronic questionnaire with nine questions was sent to 177 students as Google FormsTM. Responses from 161 students were received and analyzed using SPSS software. Results:The majority of students were satisfied with the frequency, organization, content and preparedness of classes. Half of students were neither satisfied with the amount of syllabus covered nor online teaching method. Among various teaching methods, live online lectures were most common and they were also preferred by the majority of students. Most students want hybrid or blended teaching in the post COVID-19 era. Conclusion: Online or e-teaching alone is not preferred by the majority of students. Lack of interpersonal interaction is the most likely reason for this. Hybrid or blended teaching holds the future of medical education as it is more student friendly and efficient.","Hameed, Tariq; Husain, Musharraf; Jain, Sudhir Kumar; Singh, Chandra Bhushan; Khan, Sabina",Maedica,https://doi.org/10.26574/maedica.2020.15.4.440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33603900/,825

METHODS This study utilized a mixed (time [PRE vs POST], gender [male vs female]) methods design to examine changes in the body mass index and physical fitness performance measures prior to and following closures. Data were collected from 264 third through eighth graders. This sample consisted of 131 males and 133 females. The data was collected through anthropometric (body mass index) and physical performance measures and was analyzed with separate 2 × 2 mixed-factorial analyses of variance (time [PRE, POST] × gender [male, female]). RESULTS The findings indicated both males and females exhibited mean increases in the body mass index (+10.6%; 18.8-20.8 kg·m-2, P < .001, partial η2 = .627) and decreases in push-ups (-35.6%; 7.3-4.7 repetitions, P < .001, partial η2 = .371), sit-ups (-19.4%; 22.7-18.3 repetitions, P < .001, partial η2 = .420), and the Progressive Aerobic Cardiovascular Endurance Run test (-26.7%; 31.4-22.4 laps, P < .001, partial η2 = .644) scores from PRE to POST.

103184,Effects of a Fibrin Sealant on Skin Graft Tissue Adhesion in a Rodent Model.,2016,"PURPOSE The purpose of the study was to compare rates of procedural intervention for arthrofibrosis following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) among patients who were not prescribed any pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis compared to patients who were prescribed aspirin and to patients who were prescribed other agents. METHODS A search of a national insurance claims database was performed to identify all patients who underwent ACLR from 2007 to 2017, who were active within the database at a minimum of 6 months prior to and 18 months after their surgery. The primary outcome studied was a subsequent procedure for arthrofibrosis, manipulation under anesthesia and arthrolysis (MUA/LOA). Patients who filled a prescription for aspirin, low-molecular weight heparin, direct factor Xa inhibitors, fondaparinux, and warfarin within 2 days after their surgery were included and those who filled a prescription within 3 months prior to surgery were excluded. Thromboprophylaxis status was defined as no thromboprophylaxis, aspirin, and any agent other than aspirin. Logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the association between prophylaxis status and MUA/LOA RESULTS: Of the 14,081 patients in our final surgical population, 191 patients had MUA /LOA and 13890 patients did not. 499 patients were prescribed pharmacologic prophylaxis. Rates of MUA/LOA across groups were 1.3% in the group with no thromboprophylaxis, 1.9% in the group prescribed aspirin, and 4.3% in the group prescribed any agent other than aspirin. Only the group prescribed an agent other than aspirin was significantly associated with subsequent procedure for arthrofibrosis (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.3-4.8, p=.004). CONCLUSION Patients who were prescribed a pharmacologic agent other than aspirin had a 2.6 times higher likelihood of requiring a procedural intervention for arthrofibrosis following ACLR compared to patients who were not prescribed a thromboprophylaxis agent.","Qin, Charles; Qin, Mia; Baker, Hayden; Shi, Lewis L; Strelzow, Jason; Athiviraham, Aravind",Arthroscopy : the journal of arthroscopic & related surgery : official publication of the Arthroscopy Association of North America and the International Arthroscopy Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arthro.2020.09.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32976955/,825
103448,A Model for Undergraduate Medical Student Education in Otolaryngology During the Post-COVID-19 Era.,2020-09-22,"BACKGROUND Clinical trials are currently ongoing to determine the safety and efficacy of active surveillance (AS) versus usual care (surgical and radiation treatment) for women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). This study aimed to determine upgrade rates of DCIS at needle biopsy to invasive carcinoma at surgery among women who meet the eligibility criteria for AS trials. METHODS A retrospective review was performed of consecutive women at an academic medical center with a diagnosis of DCIS at needle biopsy from 2007 to 2016. Medical records were reviewed for mode of presentation, imaging findings, biopsy pathology results, and surgical outcomes. Each patient with DCIS was evaluated for AS trial eligibility based on published criteria for the COMET, LORD, and LORIS trials. RESULTS During a 10-year period, DCIS was diagnosed in 858 women (mean age 58 years; range 28-89 years). Of the 858 women, 498 (58%) were eligible for the COMET trial, 101 (11.8%) for the LORD trial, and 343 (40%) for the LORIS trial. The rates of upgrade to invasive carcinoma were 12% (60/498) for the COMET trial, 5% (5/101) for the LORD trial, and 11.1% (38/343) for the LORIS trial. The invasive carcinomas ranged from 0.2 to 20 mm, and all were node-negative. CONCLUSIONS Women who meet the eligibility criteria for DCIS AS trials remain at risk for occult invasive carcinoma at presentation, with upgrade rates ranging from 5 to 12%. These findings suggest that more precise criteria are needed to ensure that women with invasive carcinoma are excluded from AS trials.","Oseni, Tawakalitu O; Smith, Barbara L; Lehman, Constance D; Vijapura, Charmi A; Pinnamaneni, Niveditha; Bahl, Manisha",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-020-08576-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418079/,825
104865,Practical Aspects of Otolaryngologic Clinical Services During the 2019 Novel Coronavirus Epidemic: An Experience in Hong Kong.,2020-03-20,"Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) may be classified as seropositive or seronegative according to the presence of autoantibodies. An abnormal B cell phenotype and function could be one of the main components of the immunopathology of seropositive patients, however, there is little information regarding B cell defects in these patients. This study showed a broad characterization of the B cell phenotype and function in patients with seropositive RA. We focused mainly on the evaluation of subsets, the expression of modulatory molecules of cell activation (CD22, FcɣRIIb, and FcµR), calcium mobilization, global tyrosine phosphorylation, expression of activation markers, cytokine and immunoglobulin production, proliferation, and the in vitro generation of plasma cells. Increased frequency of CD27- IgM- IgD- and CD21- B cells was observed in patients with seropositive RA compared with healthy donors (HD). Decreased expression of CD22 was primarily found in memory B cells of patients with RA regardless of seropositivity. B cells from seropositive patients exhibited normal proliferation, calcium mobilization kinetics, and global tyrosine phosphorylation, but showed an increased frequency of CD86+ B cells compared with HD. B cells of seropositive patients secrete less IL-10 after in vitro activation and showed a decreased frequency of plasma cell differentiation and IgM production compared with HD. Our data indicate that patients with seropositive RA have an increased frequency of atypical B cell populations previously associated with chronic activation and antigen exposure. This may result in the observed low responsiveness of these cells in vitro.","Rincón-Arévalo, Héctor; Rojas, Mauricio; Vanegas-García, Adriana; Muñoz-Vahos, Carlos; Orejuela-Erazo, Janine; Vásquez, Gloria; Castaño, Diana",Clinical and experimental immunology,https://doi.org/10.1111/cei.13576; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33459349/,825

106308,A Systematic Review.,2017,"STUDY DESIGN Retrospective multicenter case series study. OBJECTIVE Because cervical dural tears are rare, most surgeons have limited experience with this complication. A multicenter study was performed to better understand the presentation, treatment, and outcomes following cervical dural tears. METHODS Multiple surgeons from 23 institutions retrospectively identified 21 rare complications that occurred between 2005 and 2011, including unintentional cervical dural tears. Demographic data and surgical history were obtained. Clinical outcomes following surgery were assessed, and any reoperations were recorded. Neck Disability Index (NDI), modified Japanese Orthopaedic Association (mJOA), Nurick classification (NuC), and Short-Form 36 (SF36) scores were recorded at baseline and final follow-up at certain centers. All data were collected, collated, and analyzed by a private research organization. RESULTS There were 109 cases of cervical dural tears among 18 463 surgeries performed. In 101 cases (93%) there was no clinical sequelae following successful dural tear repair. There were statistical improvements (P < .05) in mJOA and NuC scores, but not NDI or SF36 scores. No specific baseline or operative factors were found to be associated with the occurrence of dural tears. In most cases, no further postoperative treatments of the dural tear were required, while there were 13 patients (12%) that required subsequent treatment of cerebrospinal fluid drainage. Analysis of those requiring further treatments did not identify an optimum treatment strategy for cervical dural tears. CONCLUSIONS In this multicenter study, we report our findings on the largest reported series (n = 109) of cervical dural tears. In a vast majority of cases, no subsequent interventions were required and no clinical sequelae were observed.","O'Neill, Kevin R; Fehlings, Michael G; Mroz, Thomas E; Smith, Zachary A; Hsu, Wellington K; Kanter, Adam S; Steinmetz, Michael P; Arnold, Paul M; Mummaneni, Praveen V; Chou, Dean; Nassr, Ahmad; Qureshi, Sheeraz A; Cho, Samuel K; Baird, Evan O; Smith, Justin S; Shaffrey, Christopher; Tannoury, Chadi A; Tannoury, Tony; Gokaslan, Ziya L; Gum, Jeffrey L; Hart, Robert A; Isaacs, Robert E; Sasso, Rick C; Bumpass, David B; Bydon, Mohamad; Corriveau, Mark; De Giacomo, Anthony F; Derakhshan, Adeeb; Jobse, Bruce C; Lubelski, Daniel; Lee, Sungho; Massicotte, Eric M; Pace, Jonathan R; Smith, Gabriel A; Than, Khoi D; Riew, K Daniel",Global spine journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/2192568216688186; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28451493/,825

112158,Pediatric Tracheostomy Decannulation: 11-Year Experience.,2019,"BACKGROUND Equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) induces respiratory infection, abortion, and neurologic disease with significant impact. Virulence factors contributing to infection and immune evasion are of particular interest. A potential virulence factor of the neuropathogenic EHV-1 strain Ab4 is ORF2. This study on 24 Icelandic horses, 2 to 4 years of age, describes the infection with EHV-1 Ab4, or its deletion mutant devoid of ORF2 (Ab4ΔORF2) compared to non-infected controls (each group n = 8). The horses' clinical presentation, virus shedding, viremia, antibody and cellular immune responses were monitored over 260 days after experimental infection. RESULTS Infection with Ab4ΔORF2 reduced fever and minimized nasal virus shedding after infection compared to the parent virus strain Ab4, while Ab4ΔORF2 established viremia similar to Ab4. Concurrently with virus shedding, intranasal cytokine and interferon α (IFN-α) production increased in the Ab4 group, while horses infected with Ab4ΔORF2 expressed less IFN-α. The antibody response to EHV-1 was evaluated by a bead-based multiplex assay and was similar in both infected groups, Ab4 and Ab4ΔORF2. EHV-1 specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 was induced 8 days after infection (d8 pi) with a peak on d10-12 pi. EHV-1 specific IgG4/7 increased starting on d10 pi, and remained elevated in serum until the end of the study. The intranasal antibody response to EHV-1 was dominated by the same IgG isotypes and remained elevated in both infected groups until d130 pi. In contrast to the distinct antibody response, no induction of EHV-1 specific T-cells was detectable by flow cytometry after ex vivo re-stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) with EHV-1 in any group. The cellular immune response was characterized by increased secretion of IFN-γ and interleukin10 in response to ex vivo re-stimulation of PBMC with EHV-1. This response was present during the time of viremia (d5-10 pi) and was similar in both infected groups, Ab4 and Ab4ΔORF2. CONCLUSIONS ORF2 is a virulence factor of EHV-1 Ab4 with impact on pyrexia and virus shedding from the nasal mucosa. In contrast, ORF2 does not influence viremia. The immunogenicity of the Ab4ΔORF2 and parent Ab4 viruses are identical. Graphical abstract - Deletion of ORF2 reduces virulence of EHV-1 Ab4. Graphical summary of the main findings of this study: ORF2 is a virulence factor of EHV-1 Ab4 with impact on pyrexia and virus shedding from the nasal mucosa.","Schnabel, Christiane L; Wimer, Christine L; Perkins, Gillian; Babasyan, Susanna; Freer, Heather; Watts, Christina; Rollins, Alicia; Osterrieder, Nikolaus; Wagner, Bettina",BMC veterinary research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-018-1563-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30134896/,825

METHODS 144 LRPs for which 18-month continence data were available were performed by a single surgeon, and were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided initially into two groups based on final prostate gland size: group 1 (weight less than 50 g) and group 2 (weight 50 g or more). Group 2 patients were stratified into group IIa (weight 50 to 70 g) and Group IIb (weight 70 g or more) to further examine the effect of gland size on continence. RESULTS Larger glands had higher mean prostate-specific antigen (P <0.05) but among groups there were no significant differences in patient age, Gleason sum, pathological stage, operative time, intraoperative blood loss, or positive margin rate. We noted a significant difference in mean time to recovery of continence for patients with small glands versus large glands: group 1 (8.2 months), group 2 (9.9 months), group IIa (8.5 months), and group IIb (13.8 months) (P <0.05).

In severe cases, subsequent desensitisation of the receptors results in hypoxia, vasodepression, and respiratory arrest, followed by death. Prompt action is therefore critical to improve the chances of victim's survival and recovery. Standard therapy of NA poisoning generally involves administration of anticholinergic atropine and an oxime reactivator of phosphylated AChE. Anticholinesterase compounds or NA bioscavengers can also be applied to preserve native AChE from inhibition.

116730,Prioritizing Diversity in Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery: Starting a Conversation.,2020-10-13,"BACKGROUND Most U.S. patient and health care provider surveys with regard to nasal allergy treatments were conducted before sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT)-tablets and allergy immunotherapy (AIT) shared decision-making tools were available. OBJECTIVE Patient and health care provider surveys with regard to current perceptions of nasal allergy burden, symptoms, and treatments were conducted to compare with previous surveys and provide insight into the use of SLIT-tablets and AIT shared decision-making tools. METHODS From November-December 2019, adults (N = 510) diagnosed with nasal allergies and health care providers (N = 304) who treated nasal allergies in the United States completed surveys with regard to nasal allergy management. RESULTS Of the patient respondents, 42% reported that their symptoms were only somewhat controlled and 48% had avoided activities because of their nasal allergies. In all, 38% were using only over-the-counter (OTC) medications for treatment, and 42%, 7%, and 8% had ever received subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT), sublingual allergy drops, or SLIT-tablets, respectively; 56% and 85% reported that they had never discussed SCIT or SLIT, respectively, with their health care provider. Of the health care provider respondents, 45%, 58%, and 20% were very likely to discuss OTC medications, SCIT, or SLIT, respectively. Allergists were more inclined to discuss SCIT with their patients than other health care providers (82% versus 33%, respectively). Most allergists (67%) and other health care providers (62%) reported that they did not use an AIT shared decision-making tool, primarily because of unawareness. CONCLUSION The patients with nasal allergies continued to report inadequate symptom control and activity impairment.SLIT-tablets and AIT shared decision-making tools were underused. In the coronavirus disease 2019 era, social distancing may limit office visits, which impacts SCIT administration and prompts increased use of telemedicine and a possible advantage for at-home-administered SLIT-tablets over SCIT.","Winders, Tonya; DuBuske, Lawrence; Bukstein, Don A; Meltzer, Eli O; Wallace, Dana; Rance, Karen",Allergy and asthma proceedings,https://doi.org/10.2500/aap.2021.42.210035; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34030767/,825

METHODS We collected facility-based and household costs of all nine pregnant women with COVID-19 managed at the hospital. We compared their mean facility-based costs with those paid by pregnant women pre-COVID-19, identifying cost-drivers. We also estimated what would have been paid without subsidies, testing assumptions with a sensitivity analysis. RESULTS Total utilization cost ranged from US$494 for SVD with mild COVID-19 to US$4,553 for emergency CD with severe COVID-19. Though 32-66% of facility-based cost were subsidized, cost of SVD and CD during the pandemic have doubled and tripled respectively compared to those paid pre-COVID. Of the facility-based costs, cost of personal protective equipment (PPE) was the major cost-driver (50%). Oxygen was the major driver for women with severe COVID-19 (48%). Excluding treatment costs for COVID-19, mean facility-based costs were US$228 (SVD) and US$948 (CD). CONCLUSION Despite cost exemptions and donations, utilization costs remain prohibitive.

OBJECTIVE We present our technique and outcomes of RALMA with or without enterocystoplasties and compare stomal outcomes between two different approaches of the appendicovesical anastomosis: an extravesical (EV) anterior bladder approach and an intravesical (IV) posterior bladder approach. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data from 18 children who have undergone RALMA since 2008 were retrospectively reviewed. RALMA was performed by one surgeon in an academic setting. SURGICAL PROCEDURE The appendix was anastomosed on the posterior wall of the bladder intravesically when concomitant enterocystoplasty was done. Otherwise, the appendix was anastomosed extravesically on the anterior wall of the bladder. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS The primary outcome measured was the overall continence rate. Secondary outcomes included the overall complication rate and stomal complications. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS The entire cohort included 18 patients (10 IV, 8 EV). The mean overall operative time was 494.1 min. The mean overall length of hospitalization was 5.2 d. There were five immediate, postoperative complications (all Clavien grade 1): three postoperative ilea, one stomal site infection, and one clogged suprapubic catheter. Median follow-up was 24.2 mo. The overall stomal continence rate was 94.4%. One patient from the IV group required dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer for stomal incontinence. Among the eight patients in the EV cohort, there was one stomal complication of stomal stenosis (Clavien grade 1). Among the 10 patients in the IV cohort, there were two stomal complications requiring revisions (both Clavien grade 3): parastomal hernia and stomal stenosis. Limitations of the study include retrospective design, small number of patients, and lack of direct comparison of approaches given the nature of the surgery. CONCLUSIONS Our updated outcomes of RALMA with or without enterocystoplasty continue to be encouraging, with a 94.4% continence rate. We believe that anterior EV reimplantation is a feasible option in isolated RALMA.","Famakinwa, Olufenwa J; Rosen, Alexandre M; Gundeti, Mohan S",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2013.05.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23721956/,825

We report a case of a 72-year-old man with a cecal mass found during routine colonoscopy with multiple biopsies showing normal colonic mucosa. The patient had a relevant past surgical history of a bilateral open inguinal hernia repair using the 'Plug-and-Patch' mesh system. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed a 4 × 3.3 cm mass that compressed the wall of the cecum. A neoplastic process could not be ruled out. Diagnostic laparoscopy with intraoperative colonoscopy showed that the right hernia plug was not deployed and was causing extrinsic compression of the anterior cecal wall and an intraluminal impression upon insufflation of the colon.

Although such measures may have been necessary to preserve medical resources and to prevent potential exposures early in the pandemic, moving forward, the indirect effects of such an extensive medical shutdown must not outweigh the direct harms of Covid-19. In this essay, we argue for the reopening of evidence-based health care with assurance provided to patients about the safety and necessity of high-value vaccinations, screenings, therapeutics, and procedures. To ensure that virtually all non-Covid-related services do not come to a halt again, health care systems and physician practices must preemptively increase their capacity, secure adequate personal protective equipment to safeguard health care personnel, and develop a measured approach to reclosing such routine health care, should it become necessary in the future.","Bruno, Bethany; Rose, Susannah",The Hastings Center report,https://doi.org/10.1002/hast.1168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33448404/,825

Patients were randomized to standard care or standard care + noradrenaline infusion. Low-dose noradrenaline improved intraoperative platelet aggregation and clot formation. Noradrenaline may be considered to improve intraoperative hemostasis during cardiac surgery. SUMMARY: Background New approaches to prevent bleeding complications during cardiac surgery are needed. Objective To investigate if noradrenaline (NA) enhances platelet aggregation in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Patients/Methods Twenty-four patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were included in a prospective parallel-group randomized study. All patients but one were treated with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA). In the treatment group (n = 12), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was maintained at pre-induction levels by NA infusion. In the control group (n = 12), NA was administered only if MAP decreased below 60 mmHg. Platelet aggregation (impedance aggregometry with ADP, arachidonic acid [AA] and thrombin-receptor activating peptide [TRAP] as initiators) and clot formation (clotting time, clot formation time and maximum clot firmness by EXTEM, INTEM and FIBTEM tests with thromboelastometry) were assessed before and 50 min after anesthesia induction (before cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated). Results All patients in the treatment group received NA (median dose after 50 min 0.09 (range 0-0.26) μg kg-1 min-1 ). Four patients in the control group also received NA (0.03-0.12 μg kg-1 min-1 ). There were differences between the treatment group and the control group in ADP- and AA-induced aggregation changes (ADP, +16 [25th-75th percentiles, 5-26] vs. -7 [-19 to -1] U; AA, +12 [-4 to 16] vs. -9 [-13 to 1] U). INTEM maximum clot firmness increased in the treatment group but not in the control group. Conclusion Infusion of clinically relevant doses of NA enhanced platelet aggregation and clot firmness in ASA-treated CABG patients. NA infusion is hence a potential new method to acutely improve platelet reactivity in patients on antiplatelet therapy undergoing surgery.","Singh, Sukhi; Damén, Tor; Dellborg, Mikael; Jeppsson, Anders; Nygren, Andreas",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,https://doi.org/10.1111/jth.14408; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30762945/,825
125475,Inappropriate Nasopharyngeal Sampling for SARS-CoV-2 Detection Is a Relevant Cause of False-Negative Reports.,2020-05-26,"Hnd, an FeFe hydrogenase from Desulfovibrio fructosovorans, is a tetrameric enzyme that can perform flavin-based electron bifurcation. It couples the oxidation of H2 to both the exergonic reduction of NAD+ and the endergonic reduction of a ferredoxin. We previously showed that Hnd retains activity even when purified aerobically unlike other electron-bifurcating hydrogenases. In this study, we describe the purification of the enzyme under O2-free atmosphere and its biochemical and electrochemical characterization. Despite its complexity due to its multimeric composition, Hnd can catalytically and directly exchange electrons with an electrode. We characterized the catalytic and inhibition properties of this electron-bifurcating hydrogenase using protein film electrochemistry of Hnd by purifying Hnd aerobically or anaerobically, then comparing the electrochemical properties of the enzyme purified under the two conditions via protein film electrochemistry. Hydrogenases are usually inactivated under oxidizing conditions in the absence of dioxygen and can then be reactivated, to some extent, under reducing conditions. We demonstrate that the kinetics of this high potential inactivation/reactivation for Hnd show original properties: it depends on the enzyme purification conditions and varies with time, suggesting the coexistence and the interconversion of two forms of the enzyme. We also show that Hnd catalytic properties (Km for H2, diffusion and reaction at the active site of CO and O2) are comparable to those of standard hydrogenases (those which cannot catalyze electron bifurcation). These results suggest that the presence of the additional subunits, needed for electron bifurcation, changes neither the catalytic behavior at the active site, nor the gas diffusion kinetics but induces unusual rates of high potential inactivation/reactivation.","Jacq-Bailly, Aurore; Benvenuti, Martino; Payne, Natalie; Kpebe, Arlette; Felbek, Christina; Fourmond, Vincent; Léger, Christophe; Brugna, Myriam; Baffert, Carole",Frontiers in chemistry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fchem.2020.573305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33490032/,825

OBJECTIVE To explore the influence of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) comorbidity on disease expression and outcomes, and the potential underlying mechanisms in COVID-19 patients. METHODS A total of 961 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a definite clinical outcome (death or discharge) were retrospectively enrolled. Demographic and clinical information were extracted from the medical records. Lung tissue sections from patients suffering from lung cancer were used for immunohistochemistry study of angiotensin-converting enzyme II (ACE2) expression. BEAS-2B cell line was stimulated with various cytokines. RESULTS In this cohort, 21 subjects (2.2%) had COPD and 22 (2.3%) had asthma. After adjusting for confounding factors, COPD patients had higher risk of developing severe illness (OR: 23.433; 95% CI 1.525-360.135; P < 0.01) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR: 19.762; 95% CI 1.461-267.369; P = 0.025) than asthmatics. COPD patients, particular those with severe COVID-19, had lower counts of CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells and B cells, and higher levels of TNF-α, IL-2 receptor, IL-10, IL-8 and IL-6 than asthmatics. COPD patients had increased, whereas asthmatics had decreased ACE2 protein expression in lower airways, compared with that in control subjects without asthma and COPD. IL-4 and IL-13 downregulated but TNF-α, IL-12 and IL-17A upregulated ACE2 expression in BEAS-2B cells. CONCLUSION Patients with asthma and COPD likely have different risk of severe COVID-19, which may be associated with different ACE2 expression.","Song, Jia; Zeng, Ming; Wang, Hai; Qin, Chuan; Hou, Hong-Yan; Sun, Zi-Yong; Xu, San-Peng; Wang, Guo-Ping; Guo, Cui-Lian; Deng, Yi-Ke; Wang, Zhi-Chao; Ma, Jin; Pan, Li; Liao, Bo; Du, Zhi-Hui; Feng, Qi-Miao; Liu, Yang; Xie, Jun-Gang; Liu, Zheng",Allergy,https://doi.org/10.1111/all.14517; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32716553/,825

Patients with PTSD often show excessive fear memory and impairment of fear extinction (FE). It has been reported that the stability of acquired fear memory is altered through multiple memory stages, such as consolidation and reconsolidation. FE also affects the stability of fear memory. Each stage of fear memory formation and FE are regulated by different molecular mechanisms, including the CB system. However, to the best of our knowledge, no review summarizes the role of the CB system during each stage of fear memory formation and FE. In this review, we summarize the roles of endocannabinoids in fear memory formation and FE. Moreover, based on the summary, we propose a new hypothesis for the role of endocannabinoids in fear regulation, and discuss treatment for PTSD using CB system-related drugs.","Mizuno, Ikumi; Matsuda, Shingo",Pharmacological reports : PR,https://doi.org/10.1007/s43440-021-00246-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33954935/,825

Since antibiotic resistance is increasing in society there is a need of finding alternative strategies for infection control. One potential strategy is the use of antimicrobial peptides, AMPs. In this study, we investigated the antibiofilm effect of the AMP, RRP9W4N, using a local drug-delivery system based on mesoporous titania covered titanium implants. Biofilm formation was studied in vitro using a safranine biofilm assay and LIVE/DEAD staining. Moreover, we investigated what effect the AMP had on osseointegration of commercially available titanium implants in vivo, using a rabbit tibia model. The results showed a sustained release of AMP with equal or even better antibiofilm properties than the traditionally used antibiotic Cloxacillin. In addition, no negative effects on osseointegration in vivo was observed. These combined results demonstrate the potential of using mesoporous titania as an AMP delivery system and the potential use of the AMP RRP9W4N for infection control of osseointegrating implants.","Pihl, Maria; Galli, Silvia; Jimbo, Ryo; Andersson, Martin","Journal of biomedical materials research.

In this review, we discuss how comprehensive sequencing information can be translated into personalized pharmacogenomic advice in the age of NGS. Specifically, we provide an update of the functional impacts of rare pharmacogenetic variability and how this information can be leveraged to improve pharmacogenetic guidance. Furthermore, we critically discuss the current status of implementation of pharmacogenetic testing across drug development and layers of care.

The Essay examines the principal aspects, contexts, reasons, factors, actors, and actions that contextualize the operation conducted by the state of Maranhão as an activity in paradiplomacy and Global Health Diplomacy by a subnational government in Brazil. We analyzed these concepts in light of the literature on the topic and studied the action by Maranhão based on cross-analysis of data from documents, statements, and news coverage. We conclude that the case of Maranhão illustrates the capacity of subnational bodies to respond to global emergencies, mainly in contexts of inefficacy or absence of the Federal executive, legitimizing independent action aimed at saving lives.","Alvarenga, Alexandre Andrade; Rocha, Erika Maria Sampaio; Filippon, Jonathan; Andrade, Maria Angélica Carvalho",Cadernos de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00155720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33440419/,825

PURPOSE A regional task force of health-system pharmacy leaders was created to assist with successful adoption of United States Pharmacopeia (USP) general chapter <800>. SUMMARY A group of pharmacy leaders in the Kansas City region identified potential benefits to healthcare personnel and patients if hazardous drug handling procedures were standardized. A task force was created, a preimplementation survey was distributed, and meetings were held monthly to discuss sections of USP <800> identified as the most challenging to implement. The task force focused on an assessment of risk tool, hot topics, cleanroom design, and a detailed analysis of controversial medications. After the first year of meetings, a postimplementation survey was distributed, and the results were analyzed. The task force created significant value for the participants and achieved the goal of facilitating efficient USP <800> implementation resulting in greater compliance and consistency across the multiple health systems represented. Over 5,100 beds and 200 clinic sites were affected by this task force's efforts. Nearly three-fourths (73%) of respondents reported that the task force was ""extremely helpful,"" and the majority (64%) of respondents adopted most or all (81%-100%) of the task force's assessment of risk choices. Prioritization of tasks, information sharing, and decision-making were areas where the individual leaders were most supported. CONCLUSION Creating a structure to eliminate barriers and facilitate collaboration among regional pharmacy leaders provided a framework for successful implementation of USP <800> requirements. This interdependent leadership model produced innovative and standardized solutions and should be considered when addressing complicated initiatives that impact the profession.","Duty, Ashley; Robinson, Joanna; Bahmandar, Della; Hanson, Nathan; Lucas, Amber",American journal of health-system pharmacy : AJHP : official journal of the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/zxab181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33895790/,825

Screening for LTBI and the chemoprophylaxis of positive patients are recommended prior to biologic therapy. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the TB-related safety of secukinumab (SEC) in a cohort of plaque psoriasis patients with LTBI receiving different treatments. METHODS Plaque psoriasis patients eligible for SEC treatment were screened for TB. LTBI patients (QuantiFeron-TB test positive, QFT+) receiving SEC were closely monitored by chest radiograph, ESR or hs-CRP, and blood counts every 12-20 weeks for active TB infection. QFT- patients receiving SEC treatment were screened for LTBI every 6-12 months. RESULTS Of 42 patients treated with SEC, 19 were QFT+ (45.24%). A QFT- patient became QFT+ after 6 months treatment. Two patients started SEC treatment from 2015 and 2016 and were followed up 268 and 216 months later, respectively. Three patients received chemoprophylaxis, 17 did not because of safety concerns or being unable to complete the process. During the 16- to 268-week follow-up, no signs of TB reactivation were observed in the 20 LTBI patients receiving SEC.

BACKGROUND Due to increasing ED visits annually, an efficient work environment has become one of the main concerns in designing EDs. According to the literature, an efficient work environment and teamwork improve healthcare outcomes and positively impact staff satisfaction. During the COVID-19 pandemic, EDs faced various changes such as workflow and space usage. Few studies explored staff perceptions about the influence of design features on efficiency, teamwork, and the COVID-19 spread. METHOD An online survey with 14 open- and closed-ended questions was distributed among ED staff members to collect data about unit design features that impact efficiency, teamwork, and the COVID-19 spread. RESULTS The central nursing station was one of the preferred configurations that increased efficiency and teamwork in EDs. Decentralizing disposal rooms in small-size EDs and decentralizing the medication room in large-size EDs with more than 65 exam rooms can decrease staff walking steps. Flexibility to expand treatment spaces on demand, one-way track circulation path, and changing the air pressure in COVID-19 treatment areas were some of the staff suggestions for future EDs.

This study aimed to evaluate if and how child and adolescent psychiatric visits to hospital emergency departments (EDs) changed during the pandemic lockdown, which started in Italy on February 24, 2020. METHODS We examined all ED visits by patients under 18 years of age in the 7 weeks prior to February 24, 2020, and in the subsequent 8 weeks of COVID-19 lockdown at two urban university hospitals, in Turin and Rome, Italy. ED visits during the corresponding periods of 2019 served as a comparison using Poisson regression modeling. The clinician's decision to hospitalize or discharge home the patient after the ED visit was examined as an index of clinical severity. RESULTS During the COVID-19 lockdown, there was a 72.0% decrease in the number of all pediatric ED visits (3,395) compared with the corresponding period in 2019 (12,128), with a 46.2% decrease in psychiatric visits (50 vs 93). The mean age of psychiatric patients was higher in the COVID-19 period (15.7 vs 14.1 years). No significant changes were found in hospitalization rate or in the prevalence distribution of the primary reason for the psychiatric ED visit (suicidality, anxiety/mood disorders, agitation). CONCLUSIONS In the first 8 weeks of the COVID-19-induced social lockdown, the number of child and adolescent psychiatric ED visits significantly decreased, with an increase in patient age. This decrease does not appear to be explained by severity-driven self-selection and might be due to a reduction in psychiatric emergencies or to the implementation of alternative ways of managing acute psychopathology.","Davico, Chiara; Marcotulli, Daniele; Lux, Caterina; Calderoni, Dario; Cammisa, Luca; Bondone, Claudia; Rosa-Brusin, Martina; Secci, Ilaria; Porro, Marzia; Campanile, Roberta",The Journal of clinical psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.20m13467; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33989466/,825

RECENT FINDINGS CHWs are unique members of clinical care teams because of their ability to foster a deep trust and understanding with patients by sharing similar life experiences, participating in home visits, and providing constant support and advocacy. By partnering with CHWs, other clinical care members also gain a better understanding of their patients allowing them to deliver more culturally competent, patient/family-centered care. CHWs when incorporated into interdisciplinary teams have shown to lower healthcare costs, reduce hospital stays and admissions, and improve health outcomes and quality of life for children and families. However, the lack of standardization among CHW programs makes it difficult to quantify the overall effect and impact of integrating CHWs into clinical care teams. SUMMARY CHWs are able to improve health outcomes and address social determinants of health when properly integrated into clinical care teams. However, without adequate support, integration, funding, and training, CHWs are not able to reach their full potential. The standardization of CHWs' responsibilities and training, like other clinical care team members, is lacking within the United States, making it a challenge to evaluate programs and maintain sustainable funding for these vital members of the clinical care team.","Pinto, Desiree; Carroll-Scott, Amy; Christmas, Tracy; Heidig, Maura; Turchi, Renee",Current opinion in pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.1097/mop.0000000000000940; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32889962/,825

Immunological detection methods to rapidly determine the presence of S. sclerotiorum on plants may provide growers with a viable diagnostic tool to aid with fungicide use decisions. This paper discusses the generation of a monomeric and dimeric single-chain, variable fragment (scFv) antibody with affinity for S. sclerotiorum using phage display technology. The bacterially expressed and purified scFv is shown to bind S. sclerotiorum with some cross-reactivity with the closely related phytopathogen Botrytis cinerea (Pers.:Fr.). The dimeric scFv displayed improved binding to the fungus as compared to the monomer and could detect the presence of mycelia in inoculated canola petals. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of a scFv dimer with affinity for S. sclerotiorum that has the potential for use in the development of a new diagnostic test.","Yajima, William; Rahman, Muhammad H; Das, Dipankar; Suresh, Mavanur R; Kav, Nat N V",Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/jf801768g; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18800799/,825

This type of infection is strongly correlated with the hand route of transmission of infectious agents. Thus, hand hygiene can be considered a crucial element in the prevention and control of infections.The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is an experience of a new human coronavirus infection that has been difficult for HCWs, such as dentists and dental assistants, to control. Handwashing (HW) is a keystone method for the prevention and control of spreading severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).In healthcare settings, contrary to the general consideration of HW as a simple practice, HW is regarded as a specific procedure that should be clearly instructed to HCWs. Handwashing is based on using a correct method and the necessary equipment, and its role should be continually emphasized to reinforce compliance. Proper HW might contribute to avoiding possible cross-infection during healthcare activities, particularly in the pandemic situation.The aim of this article was to report on different HW techniques in medical and dental practice, and appropriate HW equipment to perform this simple but important procedure to prevent cross-infection, particularly during the current COVID-19 outbreak.","Ait-Ou-Amar, Soumia; Berrazzouk, Soumaya; Ennibi, Oumkeltoum",Dental and medical problems,https://doi.org/10.17219/dmp/132901; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34101392/,825

However, the disadvantages of conventional injection systems hamper the delivery of vaccination technologies to developing countries. The imminent practice of easy-to-use vaccination methods is expected to overcome certain issues associated with injectable vaccinations. One innovative method is the transcutaneous immunization (TCI) system. AREAS COVERED Two major strategies for TCI are discussed in this review. One is to promote antigen permeation of the skin barrier by patch systems or nanoparticles. The other is the delivery of antigens into the skin by electroporation and microneedles in order to physically overcome the skin barrier. Moreover, adjuvant development for TCI is discussed. EXPERT OPINION Many different approaches have been developed for TCI, which have the potential to be effective, easy-to-use and painless methods of vaccination. However, in practical terms, the guidelines concerning the manufacturing processes and clinical trial evaluation of the procedures have not kept pace with the development of these novel formulations. The accumulation of information regarding skin characteristics and the properties of TCI devices will help refine TCI system development guidelines and thus lead to the improvement of transcutaneous vaccination.","Hirobe, Sachiko; Okada, Naoki; Nakagawa, Shinsaku",Expert opinion on drug delivery,https://doi.org/10.1517/17425247.2013.760542; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23316778/,825

137465,Reconstructing Forearm Free Flap Donor Sites Using Full-Thickness Skin Grafts Harvested from the Ipsilateral Arm.,2020-01-28,"BACKGROUND Continual efforts to eliminate community transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) will be needed to prevent additional waves of infection. We explored the impact of nonpharmaceutical interventions on projected SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Canada. METHODS We developed an agestructured agent-based model of the Canadian population simulating the impact of current and projected levels of public health interventions on SARSCoV- 2 transmission. Interventions included case detection and isolation, contact tracing and quarantine, physical distancing and community closures, evaluated alone and in combination. RESULTS Without any interventions, 64.6% (95% credible interval [CrI] 63.9%-65.0%) of Canadians will be infected with SARS-CoV-2 (total attack rate) and 3.6% (95% CrI 2.4%-3.8%) of those infected will die. If case detection and contact tracing continued at baseline levels without maintained physical distancing and reimplementation of restrictive measures, this combination brought the total attack rate to 56.1% (95% CrI 0.05%-57.1%), but it dropped to 0.4% (95% CrI 0.03%-23.5%) with enhanced case detection and contact tracing. Combining the latter scenario with maintained physical distancing reduced the total attack rate to 0.2% (95% CrI 0.03%-1.7%) and was the only scenario that consistently kept hospital and intensive care unit bed use under capacity, prevented nearly all deaths and eliminated the epidemic. Extending school closures had minimal effects but did reduce transmission in schools; however, extending closures of workplaces and mixed-age venues markedly reduced attack rates and usually or always eliminated the epidemic under any scenario. INTERPRETATION Controlling SARSCoV- 2 transmission will depend on enhancing and maintaining interventions at both the community and individual levels. Without such interventions, a resurgent epidemic will occur, with the risk of overwhelming our health care systems.","Ng, Victoria; Fazil, Aamir; Waddell, Lisa A; Bancej, Christina; Turgeon, Patricia; Otten, Ainsley; Atchessi, Nicole; Ogden, Nicholas H",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.200990; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32778573/,825
138385,"Family-Centered Information Dissemination: A Multidisciplinary Virtual COVID-19 ""Town Hall"".",2020-06-09,"Reliable detection and monitoring of estrus and pregnancy is essential to the effective ex situ conservation of endangered felids. Here, we review the current methods used to detect estrus and pregnancy in felids and describe the advantages and limitations of each. A total of 194 felid-focused publications were reviewed. The methods used included behavioral assessments (61 publications across 24 species), hormone monitoring (124 studies across 28 species), fecal protein monitoring (two studies in cheetah), ultrasonography (31 publications across seven species), vaginal cytology (22 publications across nine species), and laparoscopy (70 publications across 19 species). Behavior-based assessments of reproductive state are often inconsistent and unreliable in felids; thus hormone measurement is the most frequently used method for monitoring estrous cycles (66% of studies). In non-domestic felids, non-invasive fecal- or urine-based hormone metabolite analyses are preferred to blood assessments (66% of endocrine-based publications). While the measurement of fecal estrogen and progestin metabolites are useful for the retrospective assessment of ovarian activity, their use for real-time detection of estrus is limited. Vaginal cytology, laparoscopy and ultrasonography provide an acute and immediate determination of reproductive state but usually require anesthesia or sedation, which can prevent ovulation and cause abortions; thus, their use for pregnancy diagnosis is limited. Fecal progesterone or prostaglandin F2α metabolites can be used to detect pregnancy in most felids (the exception being fecal progestins for Lynx spp.), but only during mid-to-late gestation. Urinary relaxin measurement is a promising method for earlier pregnancy diagnosis (30-40% duration of gestation) but is presently limited by poor assay sensitivity due to the lack of a feline-specific relaxin antibody. Elevated levels of fecal immunoglobulin J chain have been investigated as a tool to detect pregnancy in cheetah (>80% accuracy), but research is lacking on other species. We conclude that there is no single 'best method' for monitoring ovarian activity and detecting pregnancy in felids, and current best practice would involve a combination of existing methods. Non-invasive methods for detecting estrus and pregnancy in felids (e.g., accelerometry and infrared thermography) should also be considered to augment existing methods.","Andrews, Christopher J; Thomas, David G; Welch, Marcia V; Yapura, Jimena; Potter, Murray A",Theriogenology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.theriogenology.2020.06.036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32818882/,825

In vitro studies indicate that the antiviral effect of chloroquine diphosphate (CQ) requires a high concentration of the drug. Objective To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 2 CQ dosages in patients with severe COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants This parallel, double-masked, randomized, phase IIb clinical trial with 81 adult patients who were hospitalized with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection was conducted from March 23 to April 5, 2020, at a tertiary care facility in Manaus, Brazilian Amazon. Interventions Patients were allocated to receive high-dosage CQ (ie, 600 mg CQ twice daily for 10 days) or low-dosage CQ (ie, 450 mg twice daily on day 1 and once daily for 4 days). Main Outcomes and Measures Primary outcome was reduction in lethality by at least 50% in the high-dosage group compared with the low-dosage group. Data presented here refer primarily to safety and lethality outcomes during treatment on day 13. Secondary end points included participant clinical status, laboratory examinations, and electrocardiogram results. Outcomes will be presented to day 28. Viral respiratory secretion RNA detection was performed on days 0 and 4. Results Out of a predefined sample size of 440 patients, 81 were enrolled (41 [50.6%] to high-dosage group and 40 [49.4%] to low-dosage group). Enrolled patients had a mean (SD) age of 51.1 (13.9) years, and most (60 [75.3%]) were men. Older age (mean [SD] age, 54.7 [13.7] years vs 47.4 [13.3] years) and more heart disease (5 of 28 [17.9%] vs 0) were seen in the high-dose group. Viral RNA was detected in 31 of 40 (77.5%) and 31 of 41 (75.6%) patients in the low-dosage and high-dosage groups, respectively. Lethality until day 13 was 39.0% in the high-dosage group (16 of 41) and 15.0% in the low-dosage group (6 of 40). The high-dosage group presented more instance of QTc interval greater than 500 milliseconds (7 of 37 [18.9%]) compared with the low-dosage group (4 of 36 [11.1%]). Respiratory secretion at day 4 was negative in only 6 of 27 patients (22.2%). Conclusions and Relevance The preliminary findings of this study suggest that the higher CQ dosage should not be recommended for critically ill patients with COVID-19 because of its potential safety hazards, especially when taken concurrently with azithromycin and oseltamivir. These findings cannot be extrapolated to patients with nonsevere COVID-19.

139779,Implementing a National Otolaryngology Residency Interview Calendar-Planning for Uncertainty During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-12-30,"Objectives Heart rate variability (HRV) is often measured during clinical and experimental cardiovascular reflex tests (CRT), as a reflection of cardiac autonomic modulation, despite limited characterization of the rapid responses that occur. Therefore, we evaluated the responsiveness of HRV indices in 20 healthy young adults (age, 27 ± 6 y; mass, 76.9 ± 16.8 kg; height, 1.79 ± 0.12 m) during four separate established CRT. Methods These included the [I] orthostatic challenge, [II] isometric handgrip, [III] cold pressor and [IV] cold diving reflex tests. Electrocardiogram was recorded throughout, with HRV derived from RR intervals at rest and from each CRT. On a separate day, a subgroup of participants (n=9) completed the same protocol for a second time. Results The maximal slope of heart rate change (dTdt) was significantly different between all CRT, with the orthostatic challenge producing the fastest increase (2.56 ± 0.48) and the cold pressor the fastest reduction (-1.93 ± 0.68) in heart rate. Overall HRV, reflected by Poincaré plot ratio (SD1:SD2), was significantly reduced during all CRT ([I], -0.41 ± 0.12; [II], -0.19 ± 0.05; [III], -0.36 ± 0.12; [IV], -0.44 ± 0.11; p<0.05) relative to baseline and this was reproducible in time-series. However, when HRV indices were correlated to mean-RR an exponential growth-like relationship was evident (R2 ranging from: 0.52-0.62). Conclusions These unique outcomes demonstrate that short-term alterations in HRV are evident during CRT, while indicating the importance of adjusting for, or at least reporting, underlying heart rate when interpreting such measures.","Macartney, Michael J; McLennan, Peter L; Peoples, Gregory E",Journal of basic and clinical physiology and pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1515/jbcpp-2020-0245; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33141106/,825

It has been demonstrated that audiomotor interaction can be generated following training, but whether such audiomotor interaction can be induced by auditory imagery training remains unknown. The present study aims at determining whether auditory mental imagery could induce a multimodal association with postural control. We examined static postural control in the presence of a frequency-modulated sound in three groups of participants, prior to and following a short period of training designed to create an association between auditory mental imagery of sounds and postural swaying. Results suggest that mental imagery impacted performance, as a significant decrease in postural control was observed in the experimental group following mental imagery training. Results of the control groups confirmed that the effect of mental imagery was not due to response bias, but to a significant multimodal interaction following training. These findings are in accordance with previous studies suggesting that mental imagery stimuli can interact with perceptual stimuli of a different sensory modality and lead to multisensory integration. The results also confirm that audiomotor interaction can be generated a mental imagery training. However, the full extent of mental imagery influence on multimodal interaction remains to be determined.","Nooristani, M; Moïn-Darbari, K; Pagé, S; Bacon, B A; Champoux, F",Experimental brain research,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00221-020-05903-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839854/,825

Design, Setting, and Participants US population-based observational study conducted between March 9, 2020, and May 7, 2020, using interrupted time series analyses incorporating a lag period to allow for potential policy-associated changes to occur. To isolate the association of school closure with outcomes, state-level nonpharmaceutical interventions and attributes were included in negative binomial regression models. States were examined in quartiles based on state-level COVID-19 cumulative incidence per 100 000 residents at the time of school closure. Models were used to derive the estimated absolute differences between schools that closed and schools that remained open as well as the number of cases and deaths if states had closed schools when the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was in the lowest quartile compared with the highest quartile. Exposures Closure of primary and secondary schools. Main Outcomes and Measures COVID-19 daily incidence and mortality per 100 000 residents.

School closure was associated with a significant decline in the incidence of COVID-19 (adjusted relative change per week, -62% [95% CI, -71% to -49%]) and mortality (adjusted relative change per week, -58% [95% CI, -68% to -46%]). Both of these associations were largest in states with low cumulative incidence of COVID-19 at the time of school closure. For example, states with the lowest incidence of COVID-19 had a -72% (95% CI, -79% to -62%) relative change in incidence compared with -49% (95% CI, -62% to -33%) for those states with the highest cumulative incidence. In a model derived from this analysis, it was estimated that closing schools when the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was in the lowest quartile compared with the highest quartile was associated with 128.7 fewer cases per 100 000 population over 26 days and with 1.5 fewer deaths per 100 000 population over 16 days. Conclusions and Relevance Between March 9, 2020, and May 7, 2020, school closure in the US was temporally associated with decreased COVID-19 incidence and mortality; states that closed schools earlier, when cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was low, had the largest relative reduction in incidence and mortality. However, it remains possible that some of the reduction may have been related to other concurrent nonpharmaceutical interventions.","Auger, Katherine A; Shah, Samir S; Richardson, Troy; Hartley, David; Hall, Matthew; Warniment, Amanda; Timmons, Kristen; Bosse, Dianna; Ferris, Sarah A; Brady, Patrick W; Schondelmeyer, Amanda C; Thomson, Joanna E",JAMA,https://doi.org/10.1001/jama.2020.14348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32745200/,825
144681,Outpatient versus Inpatient Parotidectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,2020-04-14,"The importance of viral infections as a leading cause of morbidity and mortality is well documented in severely immunosuppressed patients undergoing allogeneic stem cell transplantation. By contrast, viral infections generally receive less attention in patients with malignant disorders undergoing chemotherapy, where the onset of neutropenic fever is mostly associated with bacterial or fungal infections, and screening for viral infections is not routinely performed. To address the occurrence of invasive viral infections in a clinical setting commonly associated with less pronounced immunosuppression, we have prospectively screened 237 febrile neutropenic episodes in pediatric (n=77) and adult (n=69) patients undergoing intensive chemotherapy, primarily for treatment of acute leukemia. Serial peripheral blood specimens were tested by RQ-PCR assays for the presence and quantity of clinically relevant viruses CMV, EBV, HHV6 and HAdV, commonly reactivated in highly immunocompromised patients. Viremia was documented in 36 (15 %) episodes investigated, including the detection of HHV6 (n=14), EBV (n=15), CMV (n=6), or HAdV (n=1). While low or intermediate levels of viremia (<104 virus copies/ml) were commonly associated with bacterial or fungal co-infection, viremia at higher levels (>104 copies/ml) was documented in patients without evidence for other infections, raising the possibility that at least in some instances the onset of fever may have been attributable to the virus detected. The observations suggest that viral infections, potentially resulting from reactivation, might also play a clinically relevant role in patients receiving chemotherapy for treatment of malignant neoplasms, and routine screening for viremia in this clinical setting might be warranted.

145269,SARS-CoV-2 Virus Isolated From the Mastoid and Middle Ear: Implications for COVID-19 Precautions During Ear Surgery.,2020-07-23,"It is now well recognized that heart failure (HF) patients with left bundle branch block (LBBB) derive substantial clinical benefits from cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), and LBBB has become one of the important predictors for CRT response. The conventional tachypacing-induced HF model has several major limitations, including absence of stable LBBB and rapid reversal of left ventricular (LV) dysfunction after cessation of pacing. Hence, it is essential to establish an optimal model of chronic HF with isolated LBBB for studying CRT benefits. In the present study, a canine model of asynchronous HF induced by left bundle branch (LBB) ablation and 4 weeks of rapid right ventricular (RV) pacing is established. The RV and right atrial (RA) pacing electrodes via the jugular vein approach, together with an epicardial LV pacing electrode, were implanted for CRT performance. Presented here are the detailed protocols of radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation, pacing leads implantation, and rapid pacing strategy. Intracardiac and surface electrograms during operation were also provided for a better understanding of LBB ablation. Two-dimensional speckle tracking imaging and aortic velocity time integral (aVTI) were acquired to validate the chronic stable HF model with LV asynchrony and CRT benefits. By coordinating ventricular activation and contraction, CRT uniformed the LV mechanical work and restored LV pump function, which was followed by reversal of LV dilation. Moreover, the histopathological study revealed a significant restoration of cardiomyocyte diameter and collagen volume fraction (CVF) after CRT performance, indicating a histologic and cellular reverse remodeling elicited by CRT. In this report, we described a feasible and valid method to develop a chronic asynchronous HF model, which was suitable for studying structural and biologic reverse remodeling following CRT.","Wang, Jingfeng; Nie, Zhenning; Chen, Haiyan; Shu, Xianhong; Yang, Zhaohua; Yao, Ruiming; Su, Yangang; Ge, Junbo",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/56439; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29286395/,825

This reflections article provides a solution for certified stroke programs to continue to meet stroke certification requirements. One area of focus, in this article, is stroke education. Because of ""shelter-in-place orders,"" there were no visitors permitted at the bedside, yet we know that high-quality poststroke education is important to improve outcomes. The purpose of this reflections article is to share what has worked at my institution. INNOVATIONS We found that calling family members to engage them in stroke education was a great option. They seemed engaged, took notes, and asked questions. Nurses document details from these phone encounters in the patient's medical record. Many people placed the call on speaker so other family members could listen to the education session. While family members were at home, telehealth nursing has its own set of challenges. Although telehealth is not a perfect solution, it was one we found most reasonable and found it to work well through this unprecedented time.

MATERIAL AND METHODS After experimental sinus floor augmentation with a synthetic bone substitute, autogenous bone transplantation or osteoblast precursor cells, the primary stability of implants inserted in the edentulous part of the upper jaw of New Zealand White Rabbits was examined. Mechanical evaluation was performed by determination of insertion torque values (Osseocare(™) ), percussion testing (Periotest(™) ), resonance frequency analysis (Osstell(™) and scanning laser Doppler vibrometer) and measurement of extraction forces. RESULTS Evaluation of mechanical properties with percussion testing and resonance frequency analysis with Osstell(™) revealed slightly higher primary stability of the stem cell group whereas the scanning laser Doppler vibrometer and measurement of pull-out forces showed no significant difference to the bone substitute group. Transplantation of autogenous bone graft resulted in the highest primary implant stability. CONCLUSIONS The three examination modalities proved suitable for the determination of primary implant stability. The experimental maxillary sinus floor augmentation with precultured osteoblast precursor cells from autogenic stems cells clearly enhanced the primary stability of implants compared with the unaugmented sinus and lead to comparable primary mechanical properties to bone substitutes in rabbits. In comparison with the autogenous bone graft stability enhancement by stem cell transplantation declined.","Riecke, Björn; Heiland, Max; Hothan, Arne; Morlock, Michael; Amling, Michael; Blake, Felix A S",Clinical oral implants research,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0501.2010.02043.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21504476/,825
146839,Patient-Worn Enhanced Protection Face Shield for Flexible Endoscopy.,2020-06-09,"PURPOSE The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised a variety of ethical dilemmas for health care providers. Limited data are available on how a patient's concomitant cancer diagnosis affected ethical concerns raised during the early stages of the pandemic. METHODS We performed a retrospective review of all COVID-related ethics consultations registered in a prospectively collected ethics database at a tertiary cancer center between March 14, 2020, and April 28, 2020. Primary and secondary ethical issues, as well as important contextual factors, were identified. RESULTS Twenty-six clinical ethics consultations were performed on 24 patients with cancer (58.3% male; median age, 65.5 years). The most common primary ethical issues were code status (n = 11), obligation to provide nonbeneficial treatment (n = 3), patient autonomy (n = 3), resource allocation (n = 3), and delivery of care wherein the risk to staff might outweigh the potential benefit to the patient (n = 3). An additional nine consultations raised concerns about staff safety in the context of likely nonbeneficial treatment as a secondary issue. Unique contextual issues identified included concerns about public safety for patients requesting discharge against medical advice (n = 3) and difficulties around decision making, especially with regard to code status because of an inability to reach surrogates (n = 3). CONCLUSION During the early pandemic, the care of patients with cancer and COVID-19 spurred a number of ethics consultations, which were largely focused on code status. Most cases also raised concerns about staff safety in the context of limited benefit to patients, a highly unusual scenario at our institution that may have been triggered by critical supply shortages.","Friedman, Danielle Novetsky; Blackler, Liz; Alici, Yesne; Scharf, Amy E; Chin, Martin; Chawla, Sanjay; James, Monique C; Voigt, Louis P",JCO oncology practice,https://doi.org/10.1200/op.20.00440; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32853121/,825

147003,Should Gender-Affirming Surgery Be Prioritized During the COVID-19 Pandemic?,2020-06-30,"BACKGROUND The patterns and kinetics of changes in SpO2 in the 6-min walk test (6MWT) and cycling test have not been addressed in patients with COPD. METHODS We studied 60 COPD subjects, with a mean ± SD FEV1 of 54 ± 18% of predicted. We compared the changes in SpO2 (ΔSpO2) within and between the 2 tests, and the differences between the desaturators and non-desaturators. RESULTS In the 6MWT there were 4 patterns of SpO2. Desaturation then resaturation was the most common (46%). ΔSpO2 ≥ 3% occurred at approximately 1.2 min, and the nadir was at 3.5 min where resaturation occurred thereafter. The ΔSpO2 between the start and the nadir (start-vs-nadir ΔSpO2) was greater than the start-vs-end ΔSpO2 (P < .001). The desaturators had less inspiratory muscle strength, worse dyspnea, and shorter 6-min walk distance, whereas the resaturators had greater FEV1/FVC and less functional residual capacity (all P < .05). In the cycling test there were 3 patterns of SpO2. Desaturation was the most common (57%). The ΔSpO2 ≥ 3% and nadir SpO2 occurred at 4.6 min and 6.6 min, respectively, of the 6.8-min cycling exercise duration. The desaturators had lower body mass index, lower oxygen-cost diagram score, less post-exercise inspiratory muscle strength, lower diffusing capacity, lower SpO2, lower work during 6MWT, and lower peak exercise performance (all P < .05). In both tests, the start-vs-nadir ΔSpO2 during the 6MWT was greater (P = .02) but the start-vs-end ΔSpO2 was similar (P = .79). The desaturators in both tests had lower oxygen-cost-diagram scores (P < .01) and poorer peak exercise performance. CONCLUSIONS Measurement of start-vs-nadir ΔSpO2 rather than start-vs-end ΔSpO2 during the 6MWT is recommended, because start-vs-nadir ΔSpO2 is greater, and the nadir SpO2 is earlier. In both the 6MWT and the cycling exercise test, desaturation can be predicted with the oxygen-cost-diagram score, which has more capability to predict peak exercise performance than the 6MWT.","Chuang, Ming-Lung; Lin, I-Feng; Chen, Shih-Pin",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.02494; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23942752/,825

MATERIALS AND METHODS Internship training directors of APA-accredited sites report on the importance of different application materials during interview and ranking decisions. We also compare these rankings across site types. RESULTS Results indicate that internship sites were generally consistent in their criteria rankings; however, there were also some differences. Intern applicant ""fit"" continues to be the most important criteria by which applicants are judged at all stages of consideration. Qualitative analysis found that ""fit"" varied by site across themes of treatment, applicant, and site characteristics.

China has taken action to implement containment strategies, including active COVID-19 case finding, tracing, and 14-day quarantine of close contacts, and home isolation of 1.39 billion of people countywide for at least 2 weeks, etc. The combination of these strategies has brought the epidemic under control in China. The United Kingdom had deliberately not implemented containment measures for a while, instead opting to allow herd immunity strategy to develop over time. This is a ""do-nothing"" strategy whereby the virus is allowed to move through communities naturally until certain proportion of people has been infected, and the epidemic ends without intervention.

METHODS A survey link was sent to Text4Hope subscribers to assess demographic and clinical variables, including disturbed sleep, stress, anxiety, and depression using the third question on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), Perceived Stress Scale, Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale, and PHQ-9, respectively. Data were analysed using univariate and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS Overall, 6041 out of 32,805 Text4Hope subscribers completed the survey (18.4% response rate). Prevalence of disturbed sleep was 77.8%. Subscribers aged 41-60 years were twice as likely to present with sleep disturbance compared to individuals ≤25 years (OR 1.89, 95% CI: 1.27-2.81).

153042,Implementation of Preoperative Screening Protocols in Otolaryngology During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2020-05-26,"A growing body of evidence suggests the non-protein coding human genome is of vital importance for human cell function. Besides small RNAs, the diverse class of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) recently came into focus. However, their relevance for infection, a major evolutionary driving force, remains elusive. Using two commercially available microarray systems, namely NCode™ and Sureprint™ G3, we identified differential expression of 42 ncRNAs during influenza A virus (IAV) infection in human lung epithelial cells. This included several classes of lncRNAs, including large intergenic ncRNAs (lincRNAs). As analyzed by qRT-PCR, expression of one lincRNA, which we termed virus inducible lincRNA (VIN), is induced by several IAV strains (H1N1, H3N2, H7N7) as well as vesicular stomatitis virus. However, we did not observe an induction of VIN by influenza B virus, treatment with RNA mimics, or IFNβ. Thus, VIN expression seems to be a specific response to certain viral infections. RNA fractionation and RNA-FISH experiments revealed that VIN is localized to the host cell nucleus. Most importantly, we show that abolition of VIN by RNA interference restricts IAV replication and viral protein synthesis, highlighting the relevance of this lincRNA for productive IAV infection. Our observations suggest that viral pathogens interfere with the non-coding portion of the human genome, thereby guaranteeing their successful propagation, and that the expression of VIN correlates with their virulence. Consequently, our study provides a novel approach for understanding virus pathogenesis in greater detail, which will enable future design of new antiviral strategies targeting the host's non-protein coding genome.","Winterling, Carla; Koch, Manuel; Koeppel, Max; Garcia-Alcalde, Fernando; Karlas, Alexander; Meyer, Thomas F",RNA biology,https://doi.org/10.4161/rna.27504; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24440876/,825

Mapping the existing literature is necessary to help guide pediatric mindfulness interventions. Our purpose is to synthesize the evidence of reported MBIs for children and adolescents with and without physical, mental, and cognitive disorders. Accordingly, we aim to identify trends and gaps in the literature, so that we can provide direction to researchers who seek to advance the evidence base for using MBIs in pediatric populations. METHODS Our search strategy will be conducted following Arksey and O'Malley's methodological framework. It will include a comprehensive search of published studies in 7 databases, gray literature, conference proceedings, and citations of selected articles. Two independent reviewers will evaluate all abstracts and full articles that have a pediatric sample (children 2-17 years), use MBIs to promote development or to remediate underlying disorders, and are written in English or French. We will identify the definitions and concepts from MBIs, categorize accepted studies according to etiology and rehabilitation type, describe intervention methodology, and report outcomes of selected studies. DISCUSSION Our review will provide a comprehensive overview of the pediatric mindfulness intervention literature to date, involving a range of mental, cognitive, and physical outcomes for healthy children and adolescents and for those with a variety of disorders in clinical and institutional settings. We will disseminate results to mindfulness practitioners and provide guidance to future pediatric researchers in their development and application of mindfulness interventions, thereby contributing to the scientific understanding of mindfulness for the ultimate betterment of child and adolescent well-being and life-long functioning.

154158,Implications of Change to USMLE Step 1 Scoring for Otolaryngology Residency Programs.,2020-07-07,"INTRODUCTION Under the growing concern about prescription opioid misuse, abuse, addiction, tampering and diversion, stakeholders (e.g, governments, pharmaceutical companies and health care providers) are developing opioid formulations that they hope are less attractive to those seeking to misuse or abuse pain medications. However, these products must maintain their therapeutic effectiveness and safety. Many abusers tamper with formulations in an effort to convert the active ingredient into a form suitable for alternative and more abuse-desirable routes of administration, such as snorting, inhaling or injecting. AREAS COVERED A tamper-deterrent strategy is to embed opioid antagonists into the opioid agonist formulation. Upon tampering, the opioid antagonist is released and binds to the opioid receptors in sufficient amount to impede access of the agonist. This approach is intended to reduce the opioid subjective rewarding effects such as euphoria which are prominent following swallowing the dosage form without tampering. Sequestered naltrexone in sustained-release morphine or oxycodone is an example of this. We performed a comprehensive literature search using available databases to identify clinical studies utilizing an opioid agonist in combination with naltrexone. Efficacy, safety and abuse potential studies were identified for the developed products containing morphine and naltrexone as well as oxycodone and naltrexone. EXPERT OPINION The clinical impact of such combined formulations on tampering for abuse/misuse potential has not yet been determined, but long-term epidemiological studies are currently being conducted in order to answer these questions. Until these studies are complete, it seems prudent to remain cautious and assume that all formulations of prescription opioids might be abusable and that, similar to other opioids, the best current practice is to adhere to the principles of opioid risk management.","Raffa, Robert B; Taylor, Robert; Pergolizzi, Joseph V",Expert opinion on drug safety,https://doi.org/10.1517/14740338.2013.841136; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24206269/,825

Moreover, we performed a systematic review of the literature to identify any common features with other cases and to describe clinical characteristics and outcomes.Results: We found three other cases of SCLS occurring during SARS-CoV-2 infection in 2020. Taking all cases together, the mean age was 50 years (range 38-63), with a 1:1 gender ratio. Respiratory manifestations were the most common symptom, and all patients required admission to the intensive care unit. The mortality rate was 50%.Conclusions: SARS-CoV-2 infection may trigger SCLS disease, either by an overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines or by direct viral infection of the endothelium. Since SCLS may have a poor prognosis, in every SARS-CoV-2-infected patient presenting the suggestive triad of hypovolaemic shock, haemoconcentration, and hypoproteinaemia, an SCLS diagnosis should be considered and early treatment initiated.","Beber, A; Dellai, F; Abdel Jaber, M; Peterlana, D; Brunori, G; Maino, A",Scandinavian journal of rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1080/03009742.2021.1917145; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34169783/,825

155654,A New Syndrome and Kawasaki Disease Associated With SARS-CoV-2 in Otolaryngology Practice.,2020-10-06,"BACKGROUND Individuals with chronic diseases have a higher risk of serious complications or even death in case of influenza infection. The European Union (EU) set a goal to reach a vaccination coverage of 75% in seniors and chronically ill individuals. The aim of this study was to assess influenza vaccination uptake among individuals with a wide spectrum of chronic diseases and examine its regional variations and temporal trends over a period of the last ten years. METHODS We used nationwide SHI-physician outpatient claims data from the years 2009 to 2018 covering 87% of the total German population to assess influenza vaccination uptake among individuals over 1 year of age with at least one of the following chronic diseases: pulmonary, cardiovascular, liver, kidney, metabolic, neurological and musculoskeletal diseases, as well as immune deficiency disorders, including HIV infection. RESULTS Influenza vaccination coverage varied across patient populations between 19% (multiple sclerosis) and 44% (chronic kidney disease) in the influenza season 2017/18. Vaccination coverage was slightly higher among females than males, except for HIV/AIDS patients. Among HIV-patients vaccination coverage was higher by 7 percent points among males (43%) than females (37%). The coverage was higher nearly for all patient groups in the eastern than western federal states. Over the observation period vaccination uptake showed decreasing trends in most of the target groups. Among patients with HIV/AIDS and immune deficiency disorders a stagnating trend was observed. CONCLUSIONS Vaccination uptake among chronically ill individuals is suboptimal and far from the EU-defined target of 75%. There were substantial variations in coverage by disease groups, individual factors and regions. The disease-specific evaluation of the current study allows identification of populations at higher risk with considerable vaccination gaps. Further efforts are needed to improve vaccination uptake in these vulnerable population groups.","Akmatov, Manas K; Holstiege, Jakob; Steffen, Annika; Bätzing, Jörg",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2020.12.081; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33451775/,825
157075,Olfactory Dysfunction in COVID-19.,2020-05-05,"INTRODUCTION The rupture of the distal biceps tendon is a relatively uncommon lesion. Even if conservative treatment may be an option in low demanding patients, young and active subjects may benefit from an early surgical reinsertion. Many techniques and fixation devices have been described, but in the literature, there are no clinical evidences that show the superiority of any of these. In this article, we report an analysis of the ""state of the art"" and our case series of surgical reinsertion with the double approach transosseous technique. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between 2003 and 2013, 26 patients underwent surgical reinsertion, either for acute or for chronic lesions of distal biceps tendon. We evaluated 21 acute cases treated with double approach using DASH and SECEC Elbow Scores. The mean follow-up was 22 months. Range of motion, supination and flexion strength were also recorded. RESULTS Mean final ROM was 6-132° in F/E and 89-0-87° in P/S; flexion and supination strength were 96 and 88 % compared to the opposite side. The main complications were two cases of heterotopic ossifications: one asymptomatic fracture of the proximal radius and one temporary neurapraxia of the radial nerve. CONCLUSIONS Analysing the literature and our outcomes, we underline the importance of timing for surgery, in young and compliant patients, with a valid rehabilitation protocol for excellent results. The choice of surgical technique remains controversial, and we believe that the double approach transosseous reinsertion is a safe, costless and relatively non-invasive technique, offering satisfactory results when performed early.","Giacalone, F; Dutto, E; Ferrero, M; Bertolini, M; Sard, A; Pontini, I",Musculoskeletal surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12306-015-0360-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25962806/,825
158313,"Prevalence and Characteristics of Taste Disorders in Cases of COVID-19: A Meta-analysis of 29,349 Patients.",2020-12-15,"OBJECTIVE To prospectively evaluate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and perioperative outcomes in patients with T1 and T2 renal cell carcinoma (RCC) after retroperitoneoscopic radical nephrectomy (RRN), open RN (ORN) or open nephron-sparing surgery (NSS). PATIENTS AND METHODS The data of 117 patients who had undergone RRN (36), ORN (37) or NSS (44) were evaluated. RRN data were obtained at Basel University Hospital, Switzerland, while the ORN and NSS data were collected at the University of Munich, Germany. Perioperative outcomes were analysed and compared. HRQoL was prospectively evaluated based on the Short Form 36 questionnaire with a mean follow-up of 22 months. RESULTS Operative duration was significantly longer in the RRN group compared with the ORN and NSS groups, at a mean (sem) of 146 (42) min vs 113 (48) min and 114 (42) min (P < 0.001). In the RRN group intraoperative blood loss was lower than in the ORN and NSS groups, at a mean (sem) of 231 (153) mL vs 424 (361) mL and 494 (360) mL (P < 0.001). Morbidity rates were 13.9% for RRN, 16.2% for ORN and 20.5% for NSS, the most relevant complications being bleeding requiring transfusions in RRN and NSS patients and haemorrhage (5% of patients in each group). Creatinine values at 6 months after surgery only recovered completely in the NSS group. Patients in the ORN group had a trend towards higher mental well-being scores than patients in the RRN and NSS groups, with a mean Mental Component Summary Score of 48.3 vs 48.0 and 44.5, respectively (not statistically significant), while all patients were in similar physical condition after surgery, with a mean Physical Component Summary Scores of 48.0 (ORN), 47.4 (RRN) and 47.2 (NSS). The physical condition scores of patients in all groups were higher than scores reached by an age and sex-matched population (45.8). CONCLUSION These real-world data show that each of the surgical techniques can be considered safe. Importantly, after surgery patients reported high QoL scores independent of the technique used.","Gratzke, Christian; Seitz, Michael; Bayrle, Florian; Schlenker, Boris; Bastian, Patrick J; Haseke, Niko; Bader, Markus; Tilki, Derya; Roosen, Alexander; Karl, Alexander; Reich, Oliver; Khoder, Wael Y; Wyler, Stephen; Stief, Christian G; Staehler, Michael; Bachmann, Alexander",BJU international,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1464-410x.2009.08439.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19239445/,825

DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Library were searched from initiation to October 2018. METHODS: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before-after studies and studies using historic controls of older patients (mean age ⩾55 years) receiving rehabilitation for acquired disabilities. Our primary outcome was physical functioning; secondary outcomes were quality of life and rehabilitation duration. Cochrane guidelines were used to assess the risk of bias of the studies and extract data. Only RCT data were pooled using standardized mean difference (SMD). RESULTS: We included 14 studies consisting of a total of 1915 participants with a mean age ranging from 55 to 83 years. Ten out of the 14 studies had a randomized controlled design, 7 of which could be pooled for the primary outcome. The risk of bias was judged high in several domains in all included studies. The meta-analysis showed no statistically significant differences between goal-setting and care as usual for physical functioning (SMD -0.11 (-0.32 to 0.10)), quality of life (SMD 0.09 (-0.56 to 0.75)) and rehabilitation duration (MD 13.46 days (-2.46 to 29.38)). CONCLUSION: We found low-quality evidence that goal-setting does not result in better physical functioning compared to care as usual in geriatric rehabilitation. For quality of life and duration of rehabilitation, we could not exclude a clinically relevant effect.","Smit, Ewout B; Bouwstra, Hylco; Hertogh, Cees Mpm; Wattel, Elizabeth M; van der Wouden, Johannes C",Clinical rehabilitation,https://doi.org/10.1177/0269215518818224; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30537854/,825

Samols, and I. Kushner. 1985. J. Biol. Chem. 260:4169-4173). In studies in which subcellular fractions were prepared from cells incubated under pulse-chase conditions, CRP was found to be preferentially retained within the ER of normal hepatocytes, but secreted relatively efficiently in cells prepared from rabbits undergoing the acute phase response. On the basis of the detergent- dependency of specific binding of radiolabeled CRP, as well as EM visualization of biotinylated CRP identified with peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin, CRP was found to bind to the lumenal surface of permeabilized rough microsomes, while no binding was detected in Golgi fractions. As judged by both kinetic and equilibrium binding studies, rough microsomes from control rabbits were found to have two classes of specific binding sites for CRP; a high affinity site (Kd = 1 nM, Bmax = 1 pmol CRP/mg microsomal protein) as well as a much lower affinity (Kd = 140 nM) site. In contrast, only the lower affinity class was detected in microsomes isolated from rabbits undergoing the acute phase response. On nitrocellulose blots probed with radiolabeled CRP a 60-kD protein, distinct from BiP, was detected in extracts of rough microsomes isolated from control rabbits, but not in Golgi fractions or rough microsomes from stimulated animals. These findings correlate with previous observations of changes in secretion kinetics of CRP and are consistent with the hypothesis that the intracellular sorting of CRP could be rerouted by downregulation of a specific ER binding site during the acute phase response.",,J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2290050/,825
191938,Expression of ICAM-1 in nasal epithelium and levels of soluble ICAM-1 in nasal lavage fluid during human experimental rhinovirus infection.,2002,"Adjuvant nutritional treatment is a commonly overlooked topic when treating lethal viral diseases as COVID-19 pandemic. We recently introduced TaibUVID nutritional supplements (nigella sativa, chamomile and natural honey) as adjuvants for COVID-19 contacts, patients and public prophylaxis. TaibUVID Forte adds costus, senna and fennel to TaibUVID. Meta-analyses and systematic reviews confirmed evidence-based therapeutic benefits of TaibUVID components in treating many human diseases e.g. diabetes mellitus and hypertension, common co-morbidities in COVID-19 patients. Double-blind clinical trials for treating COVID-19 patients with TaibUVID supplements were inapplicable. In this retrospective study in Egypt, COVID-19 patients and contacts knew TaibUVID via social media and voluntarily used them. 65% of COVID-19 patients (n = 13) received both pharmacological treatments and adjuvant TaibUVID nutritional supplements. 35% (n = 7) received TaibUVID only. Lymphopenia rapidly improved to lymphocytosis upon regular TaibUVID intake. TaibUVID nutritional supplements helped COVID-19 contacts' prophylaxis. 70% of COVID-19 contacts (n = 14) (on regular TaibUVID intake) did not get SARS-COV2 infection. 30% (n = 6) were not using TaibUVID regularly and got mild flu-like symptoms and upon using both TaibUVID and pharmacological treatments, all improved and got negative nasopharyngeal swabs PCR. COVID-19 contacts were mainly physicians (40%, n = 8) (dealing with COVID-19 patients daily) and members of physicians' families (45%). Main presentations reported by COVID-19 patients (n = 20) were cough (90%), fever (55%), anosmia (45%), taste loss (45%), sore throat (45%), respiratory difficulty (45%) and malaise (35%). TaibUVID inhalation therapy (nigella sativa/anthemis/costus solution nebulization) was used by 65% of COVID-19 patients (n = 13) and alleviated respiratory manifestations e.g. cough and respiratory difficulty and was life-saving in some cases. 70% of COVID-19 patients (n = 14) improved in 1-4 days, 25% (n = 5) improved in 5-10 days while 5% improved in more than 10 days. TaibUVID nutritional supplements were tolerable and significantly satisfactory (P<0.01). 81.25% of COVID-19 patients (n = 13) did not report side effects. 18.25% (n = 3) reported mild diarrhea, sweating and hyperglycemia (not confirmed to be due to TaibUVID supplements). 31.25% of patients (n = 5) were satisfied by 100% with TaibUVID nutritional supplements. 37.5% (n = 6) of patients were satisfied by 75%. In conclusion, TaibUVID nutritional supplements are recommended for public prophylaxis (to decrease emergence of new cases) and treatment in COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical trials and further investigations are recommended.","El Sayed, Salah Mohamed; Aboonq, Moutasem Salih; El Rashedy, Amr Gamal; Aljehani, Yasmeen Talal; Abou El-Magd, Rabab M; Okashah, Ahmed M; El-Anzi, Mariam E; Alharbi, Mansour Barakah; El-Tahlawi, Rehab; Nabo, Manal Mohamed Helmy; Yousef, Reda S; Elshazley, Momen; Abu-Elnaga, Mostafa; Mahmoud, Hany Salah; El-Alaf, Hassan; Abdelrahman, Abdelrahman Ibrahim; Abdel-Gawad, Abdelhady Ragab; Soliman, Tamer M",American journal of blood research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33224571/,825

461244,Keys for analysis of diagnostic and serologic tests for CoV-2,2020,"Incineration experiment of medical waste was carried out in a mobile animal carcass incinerator. Simulated medical waste (69% cotton, 1.5% wood product, 4.5% mask and 25% moisture) was used as raw material. The temperature trend of first and second combustion chamber, the operating conditions and the emission characteristics of gaseous pollutants were studied. The results indicated that the temperature of first combustion chamber can be maintained at 550-650 °C without external heating, while in the final stage a burner was used to realize the burnout of material. The temperature of the second combustion chamber was always lower than that of the first combustion after the burner stopped working. The concentration of CO emission in flue gas was high due to the low disposal efficiency of the mobile incinerator, while NOX and SO2 emission concentrations were far below the standard limit value (GB 18484-2001).","Zhang, Shaorui; Zhang, Yanjun; Wang, Fengjun; Kang, Da; Wang, Jingjie; Wang, Minghao; Zhang, Chunwei; Wang, Yongtang; Liu, Hong; Zhou, Baodong; Wu, Yong",Waste Dispos Sustain Energy,,825
463498,Missing Funding Information,2020,"Pre-existing heart failure (HF) in diagnosed patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a close to two-fold increased mortality rate compared to COVID-19 patients without prior HF history. Moreover, based both on biomarker as well as imaging findings, widespread endothelial and cardiac injury seems to be present in many patients presenting with COVID-19, associated with adverse outcomes including new onset HF. Systematic echocardiographic studies in patients with COVID-19 indicate that the most common cardiac pathology is right ventricular (RV) dilatation (39%) over and above both left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction (16%) and LV systolic dysfunction (10%). In addition, myocardial injury, assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), is observed in some 55% to 70% of patients recently recovered from COVID-19 even in those who didn't get very sick during the acute illness. These observations seem to indicate a potentially rather high risk of clinical HF emerging in patients post-COVID-19, warranting close long-term monitoring of patients during recovery. On the other hand, given the established adverse prognostic role that pre-existing HF plays as a comorbidity in the context of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, it not only seems important in the still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic that all patients with known HF should proactively be well controlled and treated according to current guidelines, but also additionally be considered for priority vaccination against the SARS-CoV-2 infection if not yet vaccinated.","Standl, Eberhard; Schnell, Oliver",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,825

478910,Impact of the first month of Covid-19 lockdown on oncologic surgical activity in the Ile de France region university hospital otorhinolaryngology departments,2020,"Examination of the shape of the maximum expiratory flow-volume curve represents a method to noninvasively describe lung and airway function in health and disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection can result in pulmonary dysfunction and may result in changes to the shape of the maximum expiratory flow-volume curve during the recovery period following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Purpose The purpose of this study was to quantitatively examine the shape and the area of the maximum expiratory flow volume curve in otherwise healthy, young adults during the three months following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods Otherwise healthy, young adults (4M/3F, age: 21 ± 1 y, height: 174.9 ± 11.2 cm, body mass index: 23.6 ± 1.6 kg?m-2) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 completed spirometry testing on three occasions. The first visit (BL) took place three-to-four weeks after positive test confirmation. Approximately four weeks separated each subsequent visit (1M and 2M, respectively). Following each spirometry test, the flow-volume loop with the greatest sum of forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second was chosen for analysis. The angle beta (?°) and flow ratio were calculated using standard pulmonary function parameters. Slope ratios at increments of 5% of FVC were determined from 80% to 20% FVC. Additionally, the area under the maximum expiratory flow-volume curve was calculated. Data were compared using repeated measures analysis of variance. Statistical significance was set at p = 0.05. Results FVC remained similar over the study period (p &gt; 0.05). The ?° was significantly reduced at 2M compared with BL (BL: 188.8 ± 15.7°, 1M: 180.9 ± 6.9°;2M: 176.8 ± 5.0°, p = 0.012). Flow ratios were similar between visits (BL: 20.3 ± 11.7%, 1M: 13.0 ± 6.4%, 2M: 18.1 ± 5.9%;p = 0.53). Additionally, the slope ratios at each lung volume were similar between visits. However, while not statistically different, the slope ratio at 80% FVC approached significance (BL: 1.22 ± 0.98, 1M: 2.37 ± 1.00, 2M: 2.13 ± 0.86;p = 0.07). The total area under the maximum flow-volume curve was not different between visits (BL: 21.0 ± 5.1 L2∙s-1, 1M: 21.5 ± 4.5 L2∙s-1;2M: 21.9 ± 4.7 L2∙s-1;p = 0.49). The percentages of the total area under the curve that were contained between peak expiratory flow (PEF) and 75% FVC and between 50% FVC and 25% FVC were altered at 1M and 2M compared with BL (p &lt; 0.05). PEF tended to be greater during 2M compared with BL (BL: 8.49 ± 1.34 L2∙s-1, 1M: 9.34 ± 1.92 L2∙s-1, 2M: 9.44 ± 1.53 L2∙s-1;p = 0.056) and the changes in PEF from BL to 2M were significantly correlated with the changes in ?° and area under the curve subdivisions over the same time period (p &lt; 0.05). Conclusion These data demonstrate that the shape of the maximum expiratory flow-volume curve changes marginally during the initial three months following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Yet, the changes appear to be largely driven by increases in peak expiratory flow and suggests that SARS-CoV-2 infection is acutely involved in large airway dysfunction.","Stickford, Jonathon Augenreich Marc Province Valesha Stute Nina Stickford Abigail Ratchford Stephen",The FASEB Journal,,825

600917,Tonsil Riots and Vaccine Hesitancy: A 100-Year Legacy of Medical Mistrust.,2021-08-17,"INTRODUCTION: Disturbed sleep in hospitalized patient populations is a highly prevalent phenomenon, with patients commonly reporting problems with shorter sleep duration, more frequent awakenings, and overall poorer sleep quality during hospital stay compared to at home. Sleep disturbance during hospitalization is especially problematic as sleep is associated with both physical and psychological well-being. Poorer sleep has been found to impact recovery outcomes in a number of patient populations including mild traumatic brain injury, chronic pain, and most recently, in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The current analyses examined pilot data from a novel brief modularized sleep intervention implemented with older adult Veterans living on a subacute rehabilitation unit. METHODS: Participants were screened for sleep problems upon admission to the unit. Veterans who screened positive were invited to participate in the sleep intervention. Components of the intervention were selected based on screener responses and included group sleep hygiene psychoeducation, environmental accommodations (e.g. ear plugs, eye mask, soothing music), and CPAP use education. Measures completed at pre- and post- intervention assessed sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, PSQI), global health functioning (PROMIS Global Health Scale), and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-9). Pre- and post- scores were compared using paired sample t-tests. Two samples t-tests compared change scores in PHQ-9 between groups. RESULTS: A total of 33 Veterans were included in the analyses (Mage = 69.6, 3 female, intervention group n = 21). Participants showed a trend toward decreased PHQ-9 scores following the intervention (t(16) = 1.58, p = 0.100). There were no significant effects of the intervention on sleep quality or global health. Compared to the non-intervention group, the intervention group showed greater decrease in PHQ-9 scores at the time of post-intervention (t(25) = .828, p = .025). CONCLUSION: Preliminary data suggests that a brief modularized sleep intervention may benefit depressive symptoms for older adults during hospitalization. Additional research is needed to better understand the impact of a brief intervention on self-reported sleep quality during the hospitalization period. SUPPORT (IF ANY): This project was funded by a VISN 20 Seed Grant as a Whole Health promotion in alignment with the National VA Office of Patient Centered Care & Cultural Transformation.","Li, Yihan; Miller, Megan; Torrence, Nicole",Sleep,https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsab072.752,825
605619,Incidence and duration of self-reported hearing loss and tinnitus in a cohort of COVID-19 patients with sudden chemosensory loss: A STROBE observational study,2021-09-30,"Despite a clear association of patient’s age with COVID-19 severity, there has been conflicting data on the association of viral load with disease severity. Here, we investigated the association of viral load dynamics with patient’s age and severity of COVID-19 using a set of respiratory specimens longitudinally collected (mean: 4.8 times/patient) from 64 patients with broad distribution of clinical severity and age during acute phase. Higher viral burden was positively associated with inflammatory responses, as assessed by IL-6, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase levels in patients’ plasma collected on the same day, primarily in the younger cohort (≤59 years old) and in mild cases of all ages, whereas these were barely detectable in elderly patients (≥60 years old) with critical disease. In addition, viral load dynamics in elderly patients were not significantly different between mild and critical cases, even though more enhanced inflammation was consistently observed in the elderly group when compared to the younger group during the acute phase of infection. The positive correlation of viral load with disease severity in younger patients may explain the increased therapeutic responsiveness to current antiviral drugs and neutralizing antibody therapies in younger patients compared to elderly patients. More careful intervention against aging-associated inflammation might be required to mitigate severe disease progression and reduce fatality in COVID-19 patients more than 60 years old.","Kim, Yuri; Cheon, Shinhyea; Jeong, Hyeongseok; Park, Uni; Ha, Na-Young; Lee, Jooyeon; Sohn, Kyung Mok; Kim, Yeon-Sook; Cho, Nam-Hyuk",Front Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2021.712260; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34367117/,825
619265,“COVIDphobia” influences early otolaryngology diagnoses,2020-07-02,"Two sequences of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) regions in the domestic cat, 2.976 and 0.362 Mbps, which were separated by an ancient chromosome break (55–80 MYA) and followed by a chromosomal inversion were annotated in detail. Gene annotation of this MHC was completed and identified 183 possible coding regions, 147 human homologues, possible functional genes and 36 pseudo/unidentified genes) by GENSCAN and BLASTN, BLASTP RepeatMasker programs. The first region spans 2.976 Mbp sequence, which encodes six classical class II antigens (three DRA and three DRB antigens) lacking the functional DP, DQ regions, nine antigen processing molecules (DOA/DOB, DMA/DMB, TAPASIN, and LMP2/LMP7,TAP1/TAP2), 52 class III genes, nineteen class I genes/gene fragments (FLAI-A to FLAI-S). Three class I genes (FLAI-H, I-K, I-E) may encode functional classical class I antigens based on deduced amino acid sequence and promoter structure. The second region spans 0.362 Mbp sequence encoding no class I genes and 18 cross-species conserved genes, excluding class I, II and their functionally related/associated genes, namely framework genes, including three olfactory receptor genes. One previously identified feline endogenous retrovirus, a baboon retrovirus derived sequence (ECE1) and two new endogenous retrovirus sequences, similar to brown bat endogenous retrovirus (FERVmlu1, FERVmlu2) were found within a 140 Kbp interval in the middle of class I region. MHC SNPs were examined based on comparisons of this BAC sequence and MHC homozygous 1.9× WGS sequences and found that 11,654 SNPs in 2.84 Mbp (0.00411 SNP per bp), which is 2.4 times higher rate than average heterozygous region in the WGS (0.0017 SNP per bp genome), and slightly higher than the SNP rate observed in human MHC (0.00337 SNP per bp).","Yuhki, Naoya; Mullikin, James C.; Beck, Thomas; Stephens, Robert; O'Brien, Stephen J.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18629345/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002674,825
619355,Keys for analysis of diagnostic and serologic tests for CoV-2,2020-05-27,"The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in 153 million infections and 3.2 million deaths as of May 2021. While effective vaccines are being administered globally, there is still a great need for antiviral therapies as potentially antigenically distinct SARS-CoV-2 variants continue to emerge across the globe. Viruses require host factors at every step in their life cycle, representing a rich pool of candidate targets for antiviral drug design. To identify host factors that promote SARS-CoV-2 infection with potential for broad-spectrum activity across the coronavirus family, we performed genome-scale CRISPR knockout screens in two cell lines (Vero E6 and HEK293T ectopically expressing ACE2) with SARS-CoV-2 and the common cold-causing human coronavirus OC43. While we identified multiple genes and functional pathways that have been previously reported to promote human coronavirus replication, we also identified a substantial number of novel genes and pathways. Of note, host factors involved in cell cycle regulation were enriched in our screens as were several key components of the programmed mRNA decay pathway. Finally, we identified novel candidate antiviral compounds targeting a number of factors revealed by our screens. Overall, our studies substantiate and expand the growing body of literature focused on understanding key human coronavirus-host cell interactions and exploit that knowledge for rational antiviral drug development. One Sentence Summary Genome-wide CRISPR screens identified host factors that promote human coronavirus infection, revealing novel antiviral drug targets.","Grodzki, Marco; Bluhm, Andrew P.; Schäfer, Moritz; Tagmount, Abderrahmane; Russo, Max; Sobh, Amin; Rafiee, Roya; Vulpe, Chris D.; Karst, Stephanie M.; Norris, Michael H.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.04.447090,825

656737,Quantifying Viral Particle Aerosolization Risk During Tracheostomy Surgery and Tracheostomy Care.,2021-07-22,"Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young children worldwide. Human Bocavirus (HBoV) is an emerging virus globally associated with diarrhea. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the prevalence of HBoV genotypes in children (≤5 years) from rural communities in South Africa (SA) suffering from AGE. A total of 141 fecal samples of children ≤5 years with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) were collected from rural Primary Health Care facilities in the Vhembe district of SA between June 2017 and July 2018. Clinical symptoms and demographic data were also recorded. A total of 102 (72%) were outpatients and 39 (28%) were hospitalized patients. Human Bocavirus (HBoV) genotypes were determined using Real-Time Multiplex PCR. DNA extracts of positive samples were confirmed by conventional PCR targeting the NS1 gene. Co-infection with other enteric viruses were determined in HBoV positive samples using Real-Time PCR. HBoV was detected in 8 (5.7%) children with AGE. Children were in the age group between 1-24 months. HBoV1 and HBoV3 genotypes were each detected in 3 (37.5%) stool samples and HBoV2 in 2 (25%) stool samples. Co-infection with other enteric viruses included Rotavirus (37.5%); Adenovirus (37.5%); Norovirus (25%) and Astrovirus (12.5%). HBoV infections could be seen as a potential emerging diarrheal pathogen in South Africa. Further studies are required to understand the role of HBoV infections in children and adults with acute gastroenteritis. Acute gastroenteritis (AGE) is recognized as a major cause for mortality in children ≤5 years of age in Africa and other developing countries. Viruses known to be involved in AGE includes Rotavirus, Norovirus, Astrovirus and Adenovirus and have been reported globally. Recently the Human Bocavirus (HBoV) have been reported in numerous studies globally as a potential cause of diarrhea. In this study, the prevalence and genetic diversity of human Bocavirus in children with AGE from rural communities in Limpopo, South Africa were investigated. In total, 141 stool samples from children ≤ 5 years with AGE were assessed for the presence of HBoV using Real-Time PCR. HBoV were detected in 8 (5.7%) patients and included 3 positive samples for HBoV1 and HBoV3 respectively and 2 positive for HBoV2. No HBoV4 were detected. Among the 8 positive HBoV samples, co-infection with other enteric viruses were found in 7 (87.5%) samples, while mono infection with HBoV alone was detected in 1 (12.5%) patient. HBoV mixed infection with Rotavirus (3/8; 37.5%); Adenovirus (3/8; 37.5%); Norovirus (2/8; 25%) and Astrovirus (1/8; 12.5%) were observed in this study. This study reported for the first time on the prevalence of human Bocavirus in children with AGE from rural communities in South Africa.","Rikhotso, Mpumelelo Casper; Khumela, Ronewa; Kabue, Jean Pierre; Traoré, Afsatou Ndama; Potgieter, Natasha",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/830281,825

This prospective cross-sectional study is exploring the effect of the pandemic on mental health of medical students. The study was conducted at six Jordanian medical schools using an online survey to collect students’ socio-demographic and academic data. Assessment of mental wellbeing status was done using Kessler’s psychological stress scale (K10); the impact of COVID-19 on life activities and strategies followed to manage the situation were also examined. A total of 553 medical students were recruited for the study. Men constituted 40.1%, and women were 59.9%. Students reported that COVID-19 has affected the aspects of physical fitness (73.1%), study (68.4%), and social relationships (65.6%) the most. Sixty-six percent of the students were concerned about family members’ affection, and more than half (58.4%) explained their concerns about the inability to get clinical sessions and labs. Cooking, baking, and hobby practicing were the most popular methods to improve their mental wellbeing. About half of the participants had a severe mental disorder, and only 13.2% were likely to be well. The study indicates that half of our medical students suffer severe mental disorders, with physical fitness, exercise, and studying being among the most affected aspects during the COVID 19 pandemic. It is recommended that measures need be taken to alleviate students’ stress, which might have deleterious effects in many aspects.","Seetan, Khaled; Al-Zubi, Mohammad; Rubbai, Yousef; Athamneh, Mohammad; Khamees, Almu’atasim; Radaideh, Tala",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34138964/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253295,825

Design Case investigation. Setting and Subjects: All 79 residents and 34 Health Care Personnel (HCP) of a NH. Methods 7 days after identification of a COVID-19 resident, all residents and HCP underwent rRT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 with nasopharyngeal swabs. This was repeated weekly in all previously negative subjects until the testing identified no new cases and in all positive subjects until the testing was negative. COVID-19 infection prevention and control (IPC) measures were implemented in all residents and HCP with positive testing or with COVID-19 symptoms. Standard IPC was also implemented in all HCP. Six weeks after initial testing, all residents underwent testing for ELISA-based IgG antibodies directed against the SARS-CoV-2. Symptoms were serially recorded in residents and HCP. Results 36 residents had a positive RT-PCR at baseline and two at day 7. Six HCP had a positive RT-PCR at baseline and two at day 7. No new COVID-19 cases were diagnosed later. Among the SARS-CoV-2-positive cases, six residents (16%) and three HCP (37%) were asymptomatic during the 14 days before testing. Twenty-five residents (92.3%) and all 8 HCP (100%) with a positive RT-PCR developed IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Among the residents and HCP always having tested negative, 2 (5%) and 5 (11.5%) developed IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. These 2 residents had typical COVID-19 symptoms before and after testing and 2/5 HCP were asymptomatic before and after testing. Conclusions and Implications This study shows the validity of the updated American Testing Guidance for Nursing Homes (NHs). It suggests implementing COVID-19 IPC in both residents and HCP with positive testing or COVID-19 symptoms and warns that asymptomatic HCP with repeated negative RT-PCR testing can develop antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.","Blain, Hubert; Rolland, Yves; Tuaillon, Edouard; Giacosa, Nadia; Albrand, Mylène; Jaussent, Audrey; Benetos, Athanase; Miot, Stéphanie; Bousquet, Jean",J Am Med Dir Assoc,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1525861020305181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32674822/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1525861020305181?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.06.013,825
