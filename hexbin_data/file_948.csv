3006,3006,3006,"A missense mutation in Katnal1 underlies behavioural, neurological and ciliary anomalies",15.938142,5.1322336,2017-04-04,"Microtubule severing enzymes implement a diverse range of tissue-specific molecular functions throughout development and into adulthood. Although microtubule severing is fundamental to many dynamic neural processes, little is known regarding the role of the family member Katanin p60 subunit A-like 1, KATNAL1, in central nervous system (CNS) function. Recent studies reporting that microdeletions incorporating the KATNAL1 locus in humans result in intellectual disability and microcephaly suggest that KATNAL1 may play a prominent role in the CNS; however, such associations lack the functional data required to highlight potential mechanisms which link the gene to disease symptoms. Here we identify and characterise a mouse line carrying a loss of function allele in Katnal1. We show that mutants express behavioural deficits including in circadian rhythms, sleep, anxiety and learning/memory. Furthermore, in the brains of Katnal1 mutant mice we reveal numerous morphological abnormalities and defects in neuronal migration and morphology. Furthermore we demonstrate defects in the motile cilia of the ventricular ependymal cells of mutants, suggesting a role for Katnal1 in the development of ciliary function. We believe the data we present here are the first to associate KATNAL1 with such phenotypes, demonstrating that the protein plays keys roles in a number of processes integral to the development of neuronal function and behaviour.","Banks, G; Lassi, G; Hoerder-Suabedissen, A; Tinarelli, F; Simon, M M; Wilcox, A; Lau, P; Lawson, T N; Johnson, S; Rutman, A; Sweeting, M; Chesham, J E; Barnard, A R; Horner, N; Westerberg, H; Smith, L B; Molnár, Z; Hastings, M H; Hirst, R A; Tucci, V; Nolan, P M",Mol Psychiatry,948,1

It mainly affects the respiratory system, but it can also affect other systems. The gastrointestinal system has been found to be affected in many patients. This study investigated the COVID-19-related gastrointestinal manifestations and the effect of gastrointestinal involvement on the course and outcome of the disease. Methods: This was a retrospective descriptive study conducted on 140 COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction-positive symptomatic individuals admitted to Al-Shafa Hospital - Medical City Complex in Baghdad, Iraq during the period 2 March 2020 to 12 May 2020. Demographic data and clinical presentation and laboratory data were extracted from the case sheets of the patients and were also obtained from direct communication with the patients, their families, and medical staff. Results: Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms alone were detected in 23.6% of the patients; 44.3% of the patients presented with only respiratory symptoms, and 32.1% presented with both respiratory and GI symptoms. Patients with only GI symptoms had less severe disease compared with those who had both GI and respiratory symptoms, who had more severe disease with higher mortality. Overall mortality was 8.6%, with no mortality in the GI symptoms alone group. The highest severity and mortality were in patients with both GI and respiratory symptoms (48.39 and 13.33%, respectively). Conclusions: COVID-19-related gastrointestinal symptoms are common, and their presence alone carries a better prognosis, but their presence with respiratory symptoms is associated with higher morbidity and mortality.","Sulaiman, Tharwat; Algharawi, Ali A; Idrees, Marwan; Alzaidy, Rafid H; Faris, Kawthar; Cullingford, Graham; Rasheed, Jawad",,948,15

Given the trend for higher acuity levels among the COVID-19 patients and increased infection prevention and control (IPAC) precautions, such as donning and doffing personal protective equipment (PPE), the demands on front-line healthcare professionals have changed. To understand the changes, discrete event simulation (DES) was used to quantify the effects of varying COVID-19 policies on nurse workload and quality of care. We are testing a standard nurse-patient ratio of 1:5 where we vary the number of COVID-19 positive patients in that mix from 1 to 5. Preliminary modeling results show as nurses were assigned to more COVID-19 positive patients, the workload of nurses increased, and quality of care deteriorated. In comparison to the baseline (pre-pandemic) case, distance walked by simulant-nurse, mental workload, direct care time, missed care, missed care delivery time and care task waiting time, increased by up to 40%, 279%, −27%, 132%, 311% and 44%, respectively.

During the early phase, little was known about public knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) relating to coronavirus disease. This study was designed to determine KAP of Iranians toward COVID-19. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was carried out in Iran from February 25 to April 25 using a self-administered questionnaire on 1,480 people. COVID-19-related KAP questions were adapted from other internationally validated questionnaires specific for infectious diseases. Results: All participants were aware of COVID-19. When asked unprompted, 80% of respondents could correctly cite fever, difficulty in breathing, and cough as signs/symptoms of COVID-19. Most of our sample population knew that staying at home and isolated (95.3%) as well as constant handwashing and using disinfectants (92.5%) could prevent COVID-19. However, there were also widespread misconceptions such as the belief that COVID-19 can be transmitted by wild animals (58%) and by air (48.3%). Unprompted, self-reported actions taken to avoid COVID-19 infection included handwashing with soap and water (95.4%), avoiding crowded places (93%), cleansing hands with other disinfectants (80.), and covering mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing (76.1%). The Internet and social media (94.5%) were the main coronavirus information sources. However, the most trusted information sources on coronavirus were health and medical professionals (79.3%). The majority of participants (77.0%) wanted more information about coronavirus to be available.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess the impacts of COVID-19 on household food security in Jordan, determined the percentage of food security and the levels of food insecurity during the quarantine, determined the associated factor with food insecurity, and determined main food groups associated with FINS during the quarantine. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a Web-based validated questionnaire. The Food Insecurity Experience Scale was used to measure the food insecurity during the first four weeks of the quarantine, and a modified food consumption score was used to determine the number of times the household consumes each food group. Univariate and multiple logistic regression models were used to describe, explore, and predict risk factors correlated with food insecurity among Jordanians, during the first four weeks of the quarantine. RESULTS: A total of 3129 Jordanians had responded to the assessment and fully answered the questionnaire. 23.1% of the total participants were severe food insecure, while 36.1% were moderate food insecure, 40.7% were food secure. The regression model demonstrated the monthly income per capita below the poverty line and a number of the family member (1-4 and 5-7) associated significantly with moderate food insecurity (OR: 5.33; 95% CI: 4.44-6.40, OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.47-0.86, OR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.58-0.98, respectively). As well as with the severe food insecurity (OR: 6.87; 95% CI: 5.542-8.512, OR: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.37-0.74, 0.64; 95% CI: 0.48-0.87, respectively). Age 18-30 years old (OR: 1.80; 95% CI: 1.23-2.65) and living in a rented house (OR: 1.30; 95% CI: 1.01-1.69) were associated significantly with severe food insecurity. Carbohydrates and the meat group were significantly related to food insecurity (p-value was <0.001 for both groups). CONCLUSION: Covid-19 and its subsequent quarantine have a tangible impact on food security levels for the populations. Awareness and strategies to support individuals at higher risks should be guided not only by the income but also by other risk factors identified in the present study as the number of persons in the family, younger adults (18-30 years old), and those who do not own their houses).","Elsahoryi, Nour; Al-Sayyed, Hiba; Odeh, Mohanad; McGrattan, Andrea; Hammad, Fwziah",Clin Nutr ESPEN,948,6

Previous studies in short quarantines, found mood-related and anxiety symptomatology. Here we aimed to characterize the subtypes of psychological distress associated with quarantine, assess its prevalence, explore risk/protective factors, and possible mechanisms. METHODS: Online cross-sectional data (n = 4408) was collected during the Argentine quarantine, between 1st-17th April 2020 along a small replication study (n = 644). Psychological distress clusters were determined using latent profile analysis on a wide-range of symptoms using the complete Brief-Symptom Inventory-53. Multinomial and Elastic-net regression were performed to identify risk/protective factors among trait-measures (Personality and Resilience) and state-measures (COVID-19 related fear and coping-skills). RESULTS: Three latent-classes defined by symptom severity level were identified. The majority of individuals were classified in the mild (40.9%) and severe classes (41.0%). Participants reported elevated symptoms of Phobic-Anxiety (41.3%), Anxiety (31.8%), Depression (27.5%), General-Distress (27.1%), Obsession-Compulsion (25.1%) and Hostility (13.7%). Logistic-regressions analyses mainly revealed that women, young individuals, having a previous psychiatric diagnosis or trauma, having high levels of trait-neuroticism and COVID-related fear, were those at greater risk of psychological distress. In contrast, adults, being married, exercising, having upper-class income, having high levels of trait-resilience and coping-skills, were the most protected. Mediation analysis, showed that state-measures mediated the association between trait-measures and class-membership. CONCLUSIONS: Quarantine was associated intense psychological distress. Attention should be given to COVID-19-related fear and coping-skills as they act as potential mediators in emotional suffering during quarantine.","Fernández, Rodrigo S; Crivelli, Lucia; Guimet, Nahuel Magrath; Allegri, Ricardo F; Pedreira, Maria E",J Affect Disord,948,16

To prevent spill-over of transmission to the wider population, starting in early April 2020, residents were confined to their dormitories while measures were put in place to arrest the spread of infection. In this descriptive study we present epidemiological data for a population of more than 60,000 migrant workers living in two barracks-style and four apartment-style dormitories located in western Singapore from 03 April to 10 June 2020. METHODS: Our report draws from data obtained over the first 50 days of outbreak management to describe SARS-CoV-2 transmission in high density housing environments. Cumulative counts of SARS-CoV-2 cases and numbers of housing units affected were analysed to report the harmonic means of harmonic means of doubling times and their 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS: Multiple transmission peaks were identified involving at least 5,467 cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection across six dormitories. Our geospatial heat-maps gave an early indication of outbreak severity in affected buildings. We found that the number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection doubled every 1.56 days (95% CI 1.29 to 1.96) in barracks-style buildings. The corresponding doubling time for apartment-style buildings was 2.65 days (95% CI 2.01 to 3.87).

The S glycoprotein plays essential roles in virus attachment, fusion and entry into the host cell. Surface location of the S glycoprotein renders it a direct target for host immune responses, making it the main target of neutralizing antibodies. In the light of its crucial roles in viral infection and adaptive immunity, the S protein is the focus of most vaccine strategies as well as therapeutic interventions.

To decrease the difference between the threshold value of internal crack initiation and the corresponding theoretical value, a new model for the crack growth threshold of the interior-induced fracture at different stress ratios is proposed and discussed.","Wang, Quanyi; Chen, Yao; Liu, Yongjie; Wang, Chong; Li, Lang; He, Chao; Gong, Xiufang; Wang, Tianjian; Zhang, Wei; Wang, Qingyuan; Zhang, Hong",,948,16

The recent implementation of social distancing has redirected attention to nontraditional mental health care delivery to overcome hindrances to essential services. Telehealth has been established for several decades but has only been able to play a small role in health service delivery. Mobile and teledigital health solutions for mental health are well poised to respond to the upsurge in COVID-19 cases. Screening and tracking with real-time automation and machine learning are useful for both assisting psychological first-aid resources and targeting interventions. However, rigorous evaluation of these new opportunities is needed in terms of quality of interventions, effectiveness, and confidentiality. Service delivery could be broadened to include trained, unlicensed professionals, who may help health care services in delivering evidence-based strategies. Digital mental health services emerged during the pandemic as complementary ways of assisting community members with stress and transitioning to new ways of living and working. As part of a hybrid model of care, technologies (mobile and online platforms) require consolidated and consistent guidelines as well as consensus, expert, and position statements on the screening and tracking (with real-time automation and machine learning) of mental health in general populations as well as considerations and initiatives for underserved and vulnerable subpopulations.","Balcombe, Luke; De Leo, Diego",JMIR Ment Health,948,16

More than 1.21 million cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection and more than 67,000 COVID-19-associated mortalities have been reported worldwide till the writing of this article, and these numbers are increasing every passing hour. The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the SARS-CoV-2 spread as a global public health emergency and admitted COVID-19 as a pandemic now. Multiple sequence alignment data correlated with the already published reports on SARS-CoV-2 evolution indicated that this virus is closely related to the bat severe acute respiratory syndrome-like coronavirus (bat SARS-like CoV) and the well-studied human SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The disordered regions in viral proteins are associated with the viral infectivity and pathogenicity. Therefore, in this study, we have exploited a set of complementary computational approaches to examine the dark proteomes of SARS-CoV-2, bat SARS-like, and human SARS CoVs by analysing the prevalence of intrinsic disorder in their proteins. According to our findings, SARS-CoV-2 proteome contains very significant levels of structural order. In fact, except for nucleocapsid, Nsp8, and ORF6, the vast majority of SARS-CoV-2 proteins are mostly ordered proteins containing less intrinsically disordered protein regions (IDPRs). However, IDPRs found in SARS-CoV-2 proteins are functionally important. For example, cleavage sites in its replicase 1ab polyprotein are found to be highly disordered, and almost all SARS-CoV-2 proteins contains molecular recognition features (MoRFs), which are intrinsic disorder-based protein-protein interaction sites that are commonly utilized by proteins for interaction with specific partners. The results of our extensive investigation of the dark side of SARS-CoV-2 proteome will have important implications in understanding the structural and non-structural biology of SARS or SARS-like coronaviruses.","Giri, Rajanish; Bhardwaj, Taniya; Shegane, Meenakshi; Gehi, Bhuvaneshwari R; Kumar, Prateek; Gadhave, Kundlik; Oldfield, Christopher J; Uversky, Vladimir N",Cell. mol. life sci,948,7

Isolation of patients, limitation of visitors and interdisciplinary support, and changes in nursing and provider assessment have all had their impact on how we deliver palliative care. These barriers have altered many aspects of our established workflow and algorithms for care, including changes in communication, goals of care discussions, how providers and nurses are monitoring for symptoms, and end-of-life monitoring. These challenges required real-time solutions such as technology utilization, proposing a change in medical delivery systems, and reducing redundancy to preserve personal protective equipment.

With slowed vaccination uptake, this novel variant is expected to increase the risk of pandemic resurgence in the US in July--December 2021. What is added by this report?Data from nine mechanistic models project substantial resurgences of COVID-19 across the US resulting from the more transmissible Delta variant. These resurgences, which have now been observed in most states, were projected to occur across most of the US, coinciding with school and business reopening. Reaching higher vaccine coverage in July--December 2021 reduces the size and duration of the projected resurgence substantially. The expected impact of the outbreak is largely concentrated in a subset of states with lower vaccination coverage. What are the implications for public health practice?Renewed efforts to increase vaccination uptake are critical to limiting transmission and disease, particularly in states with lower current vaccination coverage. Reaching higher vaccination goals in the coming months can potentially avert 1.5 million cases and 21,000 deaths and improve the ability to safely resume social contacts, and educational and business activities. Continued or renewed non-pharmaceutical interventions, including masking, can also help limit transmission, particularly as schools and businesses reopen.","Truelove, Shaun; Smith, Claire P.; Qin, Michelle; Mullany, Luke C.; Borchering, Rebecca K.; Lessler, Justin; Shea, Katriona; Howerton, Emily; LucieContamin, MS; Levander, John; MPH, Jessica Salerno; Hochheiser, Harry; Kinsey, Matt; KateTallaksen, MS; Wilson, Shelby; Shin, Lauren; Rainwater-Lovett, Kaitlin; JosephC.Lemaitre, MS; ScM, Juan Dent Hulse; JoshuaKaminsky, MS; Lee, Elizabeth C.; Perez-Saez, Javier; Hill, Alison L.; Karlen, Dean; Chinazzi, Matteo; JessicaT.Davis, BS; Mu, Kunpeng; MSc, Xinyue Xiong; Piontti, Ana Pastore y; Vespignani, Alessandro; Srivastava, Ajitesh; Porebski, Przemyslaw; Venkatramanan, Srinivasan; Adiga, Aniruddha; Lewis, Bryan; BrianKlahn, MS; Outten, Joseph; Schlitt, James; Corbett, Patrick; Telionis, Pyrros Alexander; Wang, Lijing; AkhilSaiPeddireddy, MS; BenjaminHurt, MS; Chen, Jiangzhuo; Vullikanti, Anil; Marathe, Madhav; Hoops, Stefan; Bhattacharya, Parantapa; Machi, Dustin; Chen, Shi; Paul, Rajib; Janies, Daniel; Thill, Jean-Claude; Galanti, Marta; Yamana, Teresa K.; Pei, Sen; Shaman, Jeffrey; Reich, Nicholas G.; Healy, Jessica M.; Slayton, Rachel B.; ScD, Matthew Biggerstaff; Johansson, Michael A.; Runge, Michael C.; Viboud, Cecile",,948,20

The source of the virus for the cats was their COVID-19-affected owner, with whom they were in continuous proximity in a small household setting. The owner's signs included fatigue, sneezing, anosmia and loss of taste, and diagnosis was confirmed 4 days after symptom onset. Oropharyngeal and faecal swabs were collected from the cats, to investigate the course of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentrations, as well as the directionality of the chain of virus transmission. Both infected cats were real-time RT-PCR-positive on various time-points. Pharyngeal shedding of at least 6 days was observed in them, with high SARS-CoV-2 titres (> 7 Log10 copies/swab) on the first sampling time-point, that is, 7 days after the onset of owner's clinical signs. In one cat, after the initial decline, slightly increasing virus titres were measured 3 to 6 days after the first real-time RT-PCR-positive swab. Serological testing of this cat revealed absence of seroconversion. The course of viral RNA concentrations in the faecal swabs of the other cat was similar to that in its pharynx. The detected SARS-CoV-2 strains, from both infected cats and their owner, underwent whole-genome sequencing, revealing the absence of emergence of cross-species adaptive mutations in cats. The results support the notion that human SARS-CoV-2 strains are relatively well-adapted to cats. It is still unclear whether asymptomatic animals could play a role in COVID-19 epidemiology, in case of interaction with naïve animals and/or people. Our findings highlight difficulties in SARS-CoV-2 transmission to cats, as neither the two infected cats nor their owner was able to transmit the virus to a third cat living in the same small flat, despite their very close contact during the days corresponding to high virus shedding.","Chaintoutis, Serafeim C; Siarkou, Victoria I; Mylonakis, Mathios E; Kazakos, George M; Skeva, Panagiota-Nefeli; Bampali, Maria; Dimitriou, Marios; Dovrolis, Nikolaos; Polizopoulou, Zoe S; Karakasiliotis, Ioannis; Dovas, Chrysostomos I",Transbound. emerg. dis.

DATA COLLECTION: Wisconsin Health Information Organization collects claims data from various payers including private insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid, twice a year. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: For 62 of 66 hospitals, hospital-level readmission rates for MA were lower than those for Medicare FFS. The odds of 30-day readmission in MA were 0.92 times lower than Medicare FFS within the same hospital (odds ratio, 0.93; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.89-0.98). The adjusted overall readmission rates of Medicare FFS and MA were 14.9 percent and 11.9 percent, respectively. CONCLUSION: These findings provide additional evidence of potential variations in readmission risk by payer and support the need for improved monitoring systems in hospitals that incorporate payer-specific data. Further research is needed to delineate specific care delivery factors that contribute to differential readmission risk by payer source.","Jung, Daniel H; DuGoff, Eva; Smith, Maureen; Palta, Mari; Gilmore-Bykovskyi, Andrea; Mullahy, John",Health Serv Res,948,24

The 'home-officed' research team e-witnessed high-school students' daily lives and collaborated in youths' and community-based organisations' responses in the territories where they study and live. Psychosocial distress increased, also driven by the disastrous governmental response to the health and economic crises. There was growing anxiety about meeting friends and dating, with structural limits for sustaining the recommended social distancing, which added to gender/sexuality-based violence. Simultaneously, we observed students becoming relevant actors through co-producing preventive practices, surpassing risk-group notions and combining SARS-CoV-2 prevention with sexuality, gender, racism and mental-health issues. They managed internet-mediated applications to promote critical thinking and collective actions aimed at health promotion among their peers, from their homes. Freire's concept of 'untested-feasibility' fostered researchers', students' and community leaders' imaginations in the face of this unprecedented crisis, thereby enhancing social responses to the epidemic to become rights-based comprehensive dialogical preventive activities.

Several groups have advocated for 1 ventilator to ventilate 2 or more patients in the event of such a shortage. However, differences in patient lung mechanics could make sharing a ventilator detrimental to both patients. Our previous study indicated failure to ventilate in 67% of simulations. The safety problems that must be solved include individual control of tidal volume (VT), individual measurement of VT, individualization of PEEP settings, and individual PEEP measurement. The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential solutions developed at our institution. METHODS: Two separate lung simulators were ventilated with a modified multiplex circuit using pressure control ventilation. Parameters of the lung models used for simulations (resistance and compliance) were evidence-based from published studies. Individual circuit-modification devices were first evaluated for accuracy. Devices were an adjustable flow diverter valve, a prototype dual volume display, a PEEP valve, and a disposable PEEP display. Then the full modified multiplex circuit was assessed by ventilating 6 pairs of simulated patients with different lung models and attempting to equalize ventilation. Ventilation was considered equalized when VT and end-expiratory lung volume were within 10% for each simulation. RESULTS: The adjustable flow diverter valve allowed volume adjustment to 1 patient without affecting the other. The average error of the dual volume display was -17%. The PEEP valves individualized PEEP, but the PEEP gauge error ranged from 17% to 41%. Using the multiplex circuit, ventilation was equalized regardless of differences in resistance or compliance, reversing the ""failure modes"" of our previous study. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this simulation-based study indicate that devices for individual control and display of VT and PEEP are effective in extending the usability and potential patient safety of multiplex ventilation.","Sorg, Morgan E; Branson, Richard D; Hatipoglu, Umur; Chatburn, Robert L",Respir. care,948,12

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus responsible for its pathogenesis. The pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19 have been well described in the literature. Initially, it was thought to be limited to the respiratory system; however, we now recognize that COVID-19 also affects several other organs, including the nervous system. Two similar human coronaviruses (CoV) that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) are also known to cause disease in the nervous system. The neurological manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection are growing rapidly, as evidenced by several reports. There are several mechanisms responsible for such manifestations in the nervous system. For instance, post-infectious immune-mediated processes, direct virus infection of the central nervous system (CNS), and virus-induced hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable states are commonly involved. Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and its variants, dysfunction of taste and smell, and muscle injury are numerous examples of COVID-19 PNS (peripheral nervous system) disease. Likewise, hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, encephalitis, meningitis, encephalopathy acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, endothelialitis, and venous sinus thrombosis are some instances of COVID-19 CNS disease. Due to multifactorial and complicated pathogenic mechanisms, COVID-19 poses a large-scale threat to the whole nervous system.

It is also associated with atypical presentation of the disease. Despite the possible contribution of malnutrition to the acquisition and severity of COVID-19, it is not clear which nutritional screening measures may best diagnose malnutrition in these patients at early stages. This is of crucial importance given the urgency and rapid progression of the disease in vulnerable groups. Accordingly, this review examines the available literature for different nutritional screening approaches implemented among COVID-19 patients, with a special focus on elderly adults. After a literature search, we selected and scrutinized 14 studies assessing malnutrition among COVID-19 patients. The Nutrition Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) has demonstrated superior sensitivity to other traditional screening measures. The controlling nutritional status (CONUT) score, which comprises serum albumin level, cholesterol level, and lymphocytes count, as well as a combined CONUT-lactate dehydrogenase-C-reactive protein score expressed a predictive capacity even superior to that of NRS-2002 (0.81% and 0.92% vs. 0.79%) in midlife and elder COVID-19 patients. Therefore, simple measures based on routinely conducted laboratory investigations such as the CONUT score may be timely, cheap, and valuable alternatives for identifying COVID-19 patients with high nutritional risk. Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) was the only measure used to detect residual malnutrition and high malnutrition risk in remitting patients-MNA scores correlated with hypoalbuminemia, hypercytokinemia, and weight loss. Older males with severe inflammation, gastrointestinal symptoms, and pre-existing comorbidities (diabetes, obesity, or hypertension) are more prone to malnutrition and subsequently poor COVID-19 prognosis both during the acute phase and during convalescence. Thus, they are in need of frequent nutritional monitoring and support while detecting and treating malnutrition in the general public might be necessary to increase resilience against COVID-19.","Ali, Amira Mohammed; Kunugi, Hiroshi",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),948,0

This study compared epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients admitted with hospital-acquired influenza (HAI) to those with community-acquired influenza (CAI) and analyzed risk factors associated with complications. METHODS: This retrospective, observational study included all adult patients with confirmed influenza virus infection admitted to Son Espases University Hospital during the influenza season in Spain (October to May) from 2012-2013 to 2015-2016. Symptom onset before admission was included as CAI, and 2 days after admission or within 48 hours after previous discharge were considered as HAI. RESULTS: Overall, 666 patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza were included; 590 (88.6%) and 76 (11.4%) had CAI and HAI, respectively. Baseline characteristics and vaccination rates were similar in both groups. Patients with HAI had significantly fewer symptoms, less radiological alterations, and earlier microbiological diagnosis than those with CAI. Eighty-five (14.4%) and 20 (27.6%) CAI and HAI patients, respectively, experienced at least one complication, including septic shock, admission to the intensive care unit, mechanical ventilation or evolution to death (any one, P = .003). Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression was performed to assess independent risk factors associated with the occurrence of complications: nosocomial infection, diabetes, oseltamivir treatment, having received no vaccination, microbiological delay, dyspnea, and the state of confusion were the most important significant factors. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows the need to implement microbiological diagnostic measures in the first 48 hours to reduce HAI frequency and associated complications.","Fullana Barceló, Maria Isabel; Asensio Rodriguez, Javier; Artigues Serra, Francisca; Ferre Beltran, Adrian; D039, Salva; agosto, Pilar; Almodovar Garcia, Maria; Lopez Bilbao, Maria Del Carmen; Sanchis Cortés, Pilar; Reina Prieto, Jorge; Riera Jaume, Melchor",Influenza other respir. viruses,948,26

Parte I: o papel dos hormônios,15.944373,-2.8209136,2001,"Importance: Myocarditis is a leading cause of sudden death in competitive athletes. Myocardial inflammation is known to occur with SARS-CoV-2. Different screening approaches for detection of myocarditis have been reported. The Big Ten Conference requires comprehensive cardiac testing including cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging for all athletes with COVID-19, allowing comparison of screening approaches. Objective: To determine the prevalence of myocarditis in athletes with COVID-19 and compare screening strategies for safe return to play. Design, Setting, and Participants: Big Ten COVID-19 Cardiac Registry principal investigators were surveyed for aggregate observational data from March 1, 2020, through December 15, 2020, on athletes with COVID-19. For athletes with myocarditis, presence of cardiac symptoms and details of cardiac testing were recorded. Myocarditis was categorized as clinical or subclinical based on the presence of cardiac symptoms and CMR findings. Subclinical myocarditis classified as probable or possible myocarditis based on other testing abnormalities. Myocarditis prevalence across universities was determined. The utility of different screening strategies was evaluated. Exposures: SARS-CoV-2 by polymerase chain reaction testing. Main Outcome and Measure: Myocarditis via cardiovascular diagnostic testing. Results: Representing 13 universities, cardiovascular testing was performed in 1597 athletes (964 men [60.4%]). Thirty-seven (including 27 men) were diagnosed with COVID-19 myocarditis (overall 2.3%; range per program, 0%-7.6%); 9 had clinical myocarditis and 28 had subclinical myocarditis. If cardiac testing was based on cardiac symptoms alone, only 5 athletes would have been detected (detected prevalence, 0.31%). Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for all athletes yielded a 7.4-fold increase in detection of myocarditis (clinical and subclinical). Follow-up CMR imaging performed in 27 (73.0%) demonstrated resolution of T2 elevation in all (100%) and late gadolinium enhancement in 11 (40.7%). Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of 1597 US competitive athletes with CMR screening after COVID-19 infection, 37 athletes (2.3%) were diagnosed with clinical and subclinical myocarditis. Variability was observed in prevalence across universities, and testing protocols were closely tied to the detection of myocarditis. Variable ascertainment and unknown implications of CMR findings underscore the need for standardized timing and interpretation of cardiac testing. These unique CMR imaging data provide a more complete understanding of the prevalence of clinical and subclinical myocarditis in college athletes after COVID-19 infection. The role of CMR in routine screening for athletes safe return to play should be explored further.","Daniels, Curt J; Rajpal, Saurabh; Greenshields, Joel T; Rosenthal, Geoffrey L; Chung, Eugene H; Terrin, Michael; Jeudy, Jean; Mattson, Scott E; Law, Ian H; Borchers, James; Kovacs, Richard; Kovan, Jeffrey; Rifat, Sami F; Albrecht, Jennifer; Bento, Ana I; Albers, Lonnie; Bernhardt, David; Day, Carly; Hecht, Suzanne; Hipskind, Andrew; Mjaanes, Jeffrey; Olson, David; Rooks, Yvette L; Somers, Emily C; Tong, Matthew S; Wisinski, Jeffrey; Womack, Jason; Esopenko, Carrie; Kratochvil, Christopher J; Rink, Lawrence D",JAMA cardiol.
