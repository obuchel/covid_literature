However, data on the kinetics of antibodies 3 months post-vaccination are currently lacking and are important to drive the future vaccination strategy. The CRO-VAX HCP study is an ongoing multicentre, prospective and interventional study designed to assess the antibody response in a population of healthcare professionals who had received two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Two hundred individuals underwent a blood drawn within 2 days before the first vaccine dose. One-hundred and forty-two persons (71%) were categorized as seronegative at baseline while 58 (29%) were seropositive. Samples were then collected after 14, 28, 42, 56, and 90 days. Antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid and the receptor binding domain of the S1 subunit of the spike protein were measured in all individuals at different time points. Using a one-compartment kinetics model, the time to maximum concentration was estimated at 36 ± 3 days after the first dose and the estimated half-life of antibodies was 55 days (95% CI: 37-107 days) in seronegative participants. In seropositive participants, the time to maximum concentration was estimated at 24 ± 4 days and the estimated half-life was 80 days (95% CI: 46-303 days). The antibody response was higher in seropositive compared to seronegative participants. In both seropositive and seronegative subjects, a significant antibody decline was observed at 3 months compared to the peak response. Nevertheless, the humoral response remained robust in all participants.","Favresse, Julien; Bayart, Jean-Louis; Mullier, François; Elsen, Marc; Eucher, Christine; Van Eeckhoudt, Sandrine; Roy, Tatiana; Wieers, Gregoire; Laurent, Christine; Dogné, Jean-Michel; Closset, Mélanie; Douxfils, Jonathan",Emerg Microbes Infect,968,1

There is a paucity of literature describing the dermatologic manifestations of the virus, particularly in the United States. CASE REPORT: Here we present a case of COVID-19 that manifested with a purpuric rash on the lower extremities and a maculopapular eruption on the abdomen in a patient in acute diabetic ketoacidosis and normal platelet count. DISCUSSION: The reported presenting symptoms of patients with COVID-19 vary greatly. This is the first documented case of COVID-19 presenting with mixed cutaneous manifestations of a purpuric as well as maculopapular rash. CONCLUSION: The cutaneous lesions associated with the COVID-19 infection may mimic or appear similar to other well-known conditions. We illustrate a case of COVID-19 infection presenting with purpuric rash on the lower extremities and a maculopapular rash on the abdomen.","Beaupre, Randall; Petrie, Cody; Toledo, Alexander",Clin Pract Cases Emerg Med,968,24

The aim of the present study was to assess the need for surgical care performed by various surgical specialties among patients infected with COVID-19 hospitalized in a COVID-19 dedicated hospital. All surgical consultations performed for patients infected with COVID-19 in a COVID dedicated hospital in a seven month period were evaluated. Data on demographics, surgical specialty, consult reason, procedure performed, and whether it was a standard face to face or teleconsultation were gathered. Out of 2359 COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital in the seven month period, 229 (9.7%) required surgical care. Out of those 108 consultations that did not lead to surgery, 71% were managed by telemedicine. A total of 36 patients were operated on while suffering from COVID-19. Out of them, only three patients admitted primarily for COVID-19 pneumonia underwent emergency surgery. The overall mortality among those operated on was 16.7%. Conclusions: Patients hospitalised with COVID-19 may require surgical care from various surgical specialties, especially during peaks of the pandemic. However, they rarely require a surgical procedure and only occasionally require major surgery. A significant portion of potentially surgical problems could be managed by teleconsultations.","Rymarowicz, Justyna; Pędziwiatr, Michał; Major, Piotr; Donohue, Bryan; Ciszek, Karol; Nowakowski, Michał",J Clin Med,968,30
