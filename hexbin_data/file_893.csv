74447,[Advances in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism].,2020-09-07,"Influenza A viruses (IAV) are lytic viruses that have recently been found to activate necroptosis in many of the cell types they infect. Necroptotic cell death is potently immunogenic, and limits IAV spread by directly eliminating infected cells and by mobilizing both innate and adaptive immune responses. The benefits of necroptosis to the host, however, may sometimes be outweighed by the potentially deleterious hyperinflammatory consequences of activating this death modality in pulmonary and other tissues.","Balachandran, Siddharth; Rall, Glenn F",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01101-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32051270/,893
127345,[Protection suggestions on medical staff in obstetrics and gynecology in COVID-19-designated hospitals].,2020-04-25,"Guidelines advise precautionary measures for possible adverse events that may occur due to sedation during endoscopic procedures. To avoid complications, intraprocedural and postprocedural monitoring during recovery is considered important. However, since not many studies have reported on hypoxemia during the recovery period, findings for specific monitoring methods are insufficient. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence of hypoxemia during the recovery period using continuous central-monitoring by pulse oximetry and to characterize the hypoxemia cases. Among the 4065 consecutive esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) procedures under planned moderate sedation, 84 (2.1%) procedures developed unexpected hypoxemia (SpO2 ≤ 90%). Hypoxemia was observed during the procedure, at the end of the procedure, and during the recovery period in 21, 17, and 46 (1.1%) procedures, respectively. More than half of the hypoxemia cases occurred during the recovery period. Many hypoxemia cases were characterized by neither serious co-morbid illness nor low body mass index which have been reported as risk factors of hypoxemia. The lack of risk factors is no guarantee that hypoxemia will not occur. Therefore, continuous monitoring by pulse oximetry is more important during the recovery period and is recommended in all EGD procedures under planned moderate sedation.","Shirota, Yukihiro; Hirase, Yoshimi; Suda, Tsuyoshi; Miyazawa, Masaki; Hodo, Yuji; Wakabayashi, Tokio",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61120-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32152344/,893

473052,[Chinese experts' consensus on diagnosis and treatment of severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 (revised edition)],2020,"OBJECTIVE: This structured methodology review evaluated statistical approaches used in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) enrolling patients at high risk of death and makes recommendations for reporting future RCTs. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Using PubMed, we searched for RCTs published in five general medicine journals from January 2014 to August 2019 wherein mortality was &#8805;10% in at least one randomized group. We abstracted primary and secondary outcomes, statistical analysis methods, and patient samples evaluated (all randomized patients vs. ""survivors only""). RESULTS: Of 1947 RCTs identified, 434 met eligibility criteria. Of the eligible RCTs, 91 (21%) and 351 (81%) had a primary or secondary functional outcome, respectively, of which 36 (40%) and 263 (75%) evaluated treatment effects among ""survivors only"". In RCTs that analyzed all randomized patients, the most common methods included use of ordinal outcomes (e.g., modified Rankin Scale) or creating composite outcomes (primary: 41 of 91 [45%]; secondary: 57 of 351 [16%]). CONCLUSION: In RCTs enrolling patients at high risk of death, statistical analyses of functional outcomes are frequently conducted among ""survivors only,"" for which conclusions might be misleading. Given the growing number of RCTs conducted among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and other critical illnesses, standards for reporting should be created.","Colantuoni, Elizabeth; Li, Ximin; Hashem, Mohamed D; Girard, Timothy D; Scharfstein, Daniel O; Needham, Dale M",J Clin Epidemiol,,893

473054,[Chinese experts' consensus on diagnosis and treatment of severe and critical coronavirus disease 2019 (revised edition)],2020,"OBJECTIVES: Healthcare systems worldwide have been overburdened by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Accordingly, hospitals had to implement strategies to profoundly reshape both non-COVID-19 medical care and surgical activities. Knowledge about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on cardiac surgery practice is pivotal. The goal of the present study was to describe the changes in cardiac surgery practices during the health emergency at the national level. METHODS: A 26-question web-enabled survey including all adult cardiac surgery units in Italy was conducted to assess how their clinical practice changed during the national lockdown. Data were compared to data from the corresponding period in 2019. RESULTS: All but 2 centres (94.9%) adopted specific protocols to screen patients and personnel. A significant reduction in the number of dedicated cardiac intensive care unit beds (-35.4%) and operating rooms (-29.2%), along with healthcare personnel reallocation to COVID departments (nurses -15.4%, anaesthesiologists -7.7%), was noted. Overall adult cardiac surgery volumes were dramatically reduced (1734 procedures vs 3447; P < 0.001), with a significant drop in elective procedures [580 (33.4%) vs 2420 (70.2%)]. CONCLUSIONS: This national survey found major changes in cardiac surgery practice as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This experience should lead to the development of permanent systems-based plans to face possible future pandemics. These data may effectively help policy decision-making in prioritizing healthcare resource reallocation during the ongoing pandemic and once the healthcare emergency is over.","Rubino, Antonino Salvatore; De Santo, Luca Salvatore; Pisano, Antonio; Mauro, Michele di; Benussi, Stefano; Borghetti, Valentino; Castiglioni, Alessandro; Chiariello, Luigi; Colli, Andrea; De Bellis, Antonio; De Filippo, Carlo Maria; De Paulis, Ruggero; Di Benedetto, Giuseppe; Di Eusanio, Marco; Faggian, Giuseppe; Fiorani, Brenno; Fratto, Pasquale Antonio; Giuffrida, Angelo Giuseppe; Glauber, Mattia; Iannelli, Gabriele; Iesu, Severino; Livi, Ugolino; Martinelli, Gianluca; Massetti, Massimo; Mastroroberto, Pasquale; Menicanti, Lorenzo; Minniti, Giuseppe; Miraldi, Fabio; Montesi, Gianfranco; Musumeci, Francesco; Nicolini, Francesco; Pace Napoleone, Carlo; Panisi, Paolo; Pappalardo, Aniello; Patanè, Francesco; Ragni, Temistocle; Rinaldi, Mauro; Tribastone, Salvatore; Triggiani, Michele; Tritto, Francesco Paolo; Zebele, Carlo; Parolari, Alessandro; Gerosa, Gino; De Feo, Marisa",Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,,893
