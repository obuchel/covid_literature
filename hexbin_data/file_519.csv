6936,"Evaluation of TNF as antiviral, antibacterial and antiparasitic agent",1991,"T follicular regulatory (Tfr) cell is a CXCR5(+)Foxp3(+) subset of T regulatory (Treg) cell with critical roles in regulating germinal center responses and modulating the immune environment in the lymph nodes. Studies have shown that the proportion of Tfr cells may increase during acute inflammation. In this study, we investigated the role of Tfr cells in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). We found that Tfr cells were significantly enriched in peripheral blood and in mini-bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) during the onset of ARDS. Notably, Tfr cells represented the majority of Treg cells in the mini-BAL samples. Tfr cells also showed CTLA-4, IL-10, and TGF-β expression, but compared to the non-Tfr Treg cells, the CTLA-4 and IL-10 expression by Tfr cells were slightly reduced. Both Tfr cells and non-Tfr Treg cells suppressed the proliferation of autologous CD4(+)CD25(−) T cells; however, the Tfr cells displayed slightly reduced suppression capacity. Subsequently, B cells were co-incubated with autologous Tfr cells or non-Tfr Treg cells. Interestingly, we found that the frequency of IL-10(+) Breg cells was significantly higher following incubation with Tfr cells than with non-Tfr Treg cells, which suggested that Tfr cells were more potent at inducing IL-10(+) Breg cells. Together, these results demonstrated that Tfr cells were a similar but distinctive subset of Treg cells. Given that Tfr cells were strongly enriched in ARDS patients, especially in the lung infiltrates, they may exert critical ameliorating effects in ARDS.","Li, Hongqiang; Zhou, Runv; Wang, Chunmei; Li, Yusheng; Zheng, Guizhen; Jiang, Sen; Dong, Tiancao; Bai, Jianwen; Xu, Shumin",Immunol Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102368/,519
35931,Hydroxychloroquine: QTc prolongation following off-label-use: case report,2020-07-04,"Almost all CDCL SAT solvers use the 1-UIP clause learning scheme for learning new clauses from conflicts, and our current understanding of SAT solving provides good reasons for using that scheme. In particular, the 1-UIP scheme yields asserting clauses, and these asserting clauses have minimum LBD among all possible asserting clauses. As a result of these advantages, other clause learning schemes, like i-UIP and all-UIP, that were proposed in early work are not used in modern solvers. In this paper, we propose a new technique for exploiting the all-UIP clause learning scheme. Our technique is to employ all-UIP learning under the constraint that the learnt clause’s LBD does not increase (over the minimum established by the 1-UIP clause). Our method can learn clauses that are significantly smaller than the 1-UIP clause while preserving the minimum LBD. Unlike previous clause minimization methods, our technique is not limited to learning a sub-clause of the 1-UIP clause. We show empirically that our method can improve the performance of state of the art solvers.","Feng, Nick; Bacchus, Fahiem",Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing - SAT 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7326470/,519

However, the existing skin lesion methods are mainly relying on conventional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the performance of skin lesion recognition is far from satisfactory. Therefore, to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks of traditional methods, we propose a novel Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) system, named DermoNet, based on Multi-Scale Feature Level (MSFL) blocks and Multi-Level Feature Fusion (MLFF). Further, the DermoNet approach yields a significant enhancement in terms of dealing with the challenge of small training data sizes in the dermoscopic domain and avoiding high similarity between classes and overfitting issue. Extensive experiments are conducted on the public dermoscopic dataset, and the results demonstrate that DermoNet outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. Hence, DermoNet can achieve an excellent diagnostic efficiency in the auxiliary diagnosis of skin lesions.","Bakkouri, Ibtissam; Afdel, Karim",Image and Signal Processing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7340898/,519

METHODS: A retrospective case-control study was performed on 345 children with Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (MPP) admitted to our hospital wards from January 2017 to June 2019. They were divided into three groups, namely MPP with hypoxia, refractory Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (RMPP), and general Mycoplasma pneumoniae pneumonia (GMPP). The clinical features, laboratory findings, imaging, and management were collected and compared in the three groups. RESULTS: The MPP with hypoxia patients (n = 69) had longer disease duration, a higher extra-pulmonary complications rate, and more severe radiological abnormalities (P < 0.05). They also needed more complicated treatments (P < 0.05). Meanwhile, the levels of white blood cell count (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), interleukin (IL)-6, ferritin, D-dimer, fibrinogen (FG), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and the percentage of neutrophils in the MPP with hypoxia group were significantly higher than those in the RMPP group and the GMPP group (P < 0.05). In ROC curve analysis, the percentage of neutrophils, WBC, CRP, LDH, IL-6, ferritin, D-dimer, and ALT were contributed to identify the MPP with hypoxia patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that ferritin> 174.15 ng/mL, IL-6 > 25.475 pg/ml, and pleural effusion were significantly associated with the incidence of hypoxia in MPP (P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: MPP with hypoxia patients presented more serious clinical manifestations. Ferritin> 174.15 ng/mL, IL-6 > 25.475 pg/ml and pleural effusion were related risk factors for hypoxia in MPP.","Ling, Yaoyao; Zhang, Tongqiang; Guo, Wei; Zhu, Zhenli; Tian, Jiao; Cai, Chunquan; Xu, Yongsheng",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7374650/,519

Traditionally, the disease mapping tasks have faced many challenges—(1) authors rarely documented the evidence that were used to create map, (2) before evolution of GIS, many errors aroused in mapping tasks which were expanded extremely at global scales, and (3) there were no fidelity assessment of maps which resulted in inaccurate precision. This study on infectious diseases geo-surveillance is divided into four broad sections with emphasis on handling geographical and temporal issues to help in public health decision-making and planning policies: (1) geospatial mapping of diseases using its spatial and temporal information to understand their behaviour across geography; (2) the citizen’s involvement as volunteers in giving health and disease data to assess the critical situation for disease’s spread and prevention in neighbourhood effect; (3) scientific analysis of health-related behaviour using mathematical epidemiological and geo-statistical approaches with (4) capacity building program.

All bacterial cultures positive for GBS, from 2005 to 2019 from 3 hospitals of the Brussels-Capital Region, were extracted, and only cases of invasive diseases were included. Medical files were retrospectively retrieved for risk factors, clinical manifestations and outcome and also antibiotic-susceptibility testing and GBS serotypes. Incidence rates were calculated based on the hospitals catchment populations. A total of 337 cases of GBS-invasive infections were included. The incidence of invasive GBS for the 3 hospitals increased from 3.7 to 8.2 cases per 100.000 inhabitants between 2009 and 2018 (p = 0.04). The most frequently identified risk factors were diabetes (36.8%), obesity (35.0%), cancer (21.7%), renal disease (20.8%), and advanced age (≥ 65 years; 47.2%). Isolated bacteremia (22%), osteoarticular infection (21.4%), abscesses (13.9%), and skin and soft tissue infections (18.4%) were the most frequent manifestations. Intensive care unit admission was required in 21.7% and overall mortality was 9.4%. All strains remained susceptible to penicillin over the years. Up to 20% of strains were resistant to clindamycin. Serotypes Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, and V represented 96.8% of the available serotypes (60/62). As reported in several countries, invasive GBS disease in non-pregnant adults represents an increasing burden, particularly among diabetic, obese, and elderly patients.

40701,Hydroxychloroquine: Sinus bradycardia and QTc prolongation following off-label use: case report,2020-10-10,"BACKGROUND: At the end of February 2020 a new case was diagnosed with COVID-19 in north Italy, suddenly followed by new cases. Italian health authorities decided to enforce restrictive measures. Northern areas of Italy were identified as “red areas” to slow down the epidemic and its impact on the healthcare system. From this perspective, the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy constitutes a testing ground for the assessment of the ability of consumers to cope with this health risk. METHODS: A cross-sectional study on a representative sample of 1000 Italian citizens was conducted over the period 27 February- 5 March exploring the following hypotheses: 1) less engaged individuals are more concerned for the health emergency and feel more vulnerable; 2) less engaged have higher probability to develop negative attitudes and dysfunctional behaviors. RESULTS: only the 16% the interviewees presented a high level of engagement. Lower levels of engagement were measured in the southern parts of Italy (not yet touched by the epidemics at the time of data collection). People with lowers levels of engagement reported higher fears for the contagion and sense of vulnerability. Furthermore, they showed the lower levels of trust in the Public Health Authorities, in medical research and in vaccines. Finally, they appeared more dismissive in their preventive behaviors and more disorganized in the fruition of the healthcare services. CONCLUSIONS: A psychological analysis of processes of attitudinal and role change in the direction of becoming more engaged in health prevention is worthy in order to forecast potential dysfunctional reactions to restrictive health prevention measures and to orient personalized education initiatives to consumers with different level of engagement. KEY MESSAGES: Profiling based on the levels of health engagement is important in order to plan more effective healthcare measures during epidemics. Targeted educational initiatives should take into account citizens' engagement profiles.","Graffigna, G; Barello, S; Palamenghi, L; Savarese, M; Castellini, G",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543550/,519
40702,Favipiravir: Hyperuricaemia and acute gouty arthritis following off-label use: case report,2020-10-10,"BACKGROUND: At the end of 2019, a novel pneumonia-causing Coronavirus called Sars-CoV-2 was first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It subsequently spread throughout China and elsewhere, becoming a global health emergency. In February 2020, WHO designated the disease COVID-19, which stands for Coronavirus disease 2019. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic on the perception of young Italians and to assess their knowledge and attitudes about the disease. METHODS: An online survey was conducted on 3rd-4th-5th February 2020 with the collaboration of “Skuola.net”, an important Italian Website for students. Young people had the opportunity to participate in the survey by answering an ad hoc questionnaire created to investigate knowledge and attitudes about the new Coronavirus, using a link published on the homepage. RESULTS: 5234 responses were received of which 3262 were females and 1972 were males, aged from 11 to 30. 82,4% were students (50,4% high school students) while 17,6% did not attend school or university. Regarding knowledge, 80% of the participants knew that the infection occurs through droplets from infected people; 63% knew that symptoms can appear up to 14 days after exposure; 80% knew that a vaccine has not yet been discovered. Regarding attitudes, 36% admitted that their attitude towards Chinese tourists has significantly worsened; 26% did not buy from Chinese run stores and 24% avoided Chinese restaurants. CONCLUSIONS: Although most of the participants seem correctly informed about COVID-19, young Italians are at risk of assuming irrational behavior due to psychosis. KEY MESSAGES: The global emergency of COVID-19 needs adequate information to avoid the spread of dangerous psychoses. Young people, usual users of social networks as a means of information, are more at risk of being influenced by fake news and adopting wrong behaviors.","Lia, L; Dorelli, B; Marte, M; Chiappetta, M; Faticoni, A; Lucaccini Paoli, L; Grassucci, D; Gelardini, M; Ardizzone, C; La Torre, G",Eur J Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7543551/,519

We describe 60-day outcomes for patients critically ill with confirmed COVID-19 and explore the potential bias in the weekly reported data by ICNARC. METHODS: First 200 consecutive patients with confirmed COVID-19, admitted for critical care in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, followed-up for a minimum of 60 days from admission. Outcomes included survival and duration of critical care, receipt/duration of organ support in critical care and hospital survival. RESULTS: Mean age was 62.6 years, 70.5% were male, 52.0% were white, 39.2% obese and 9.0% had serious comorbidities. Median APACHE II score was 16 (IQR 12, 19). After 60 days, 83 (41.5%) patients had been discharged from hospital, 15 (7.5%) had been discharged from critical care but remained in hospital, 1 (0.5%) was still receiving critical care, 90 (45.0%) had died while receiving critical care and 11 (5.5%) had died in hospital after discharge from critical care. Median duration of critical care was 14.0 days (IQR 6.1, 23.0) for survivors and 10.0 days (IQR 5.0, 16.0) for non-survivors of critical care. Overall, 158 (79.0%) patients received advanced respiratory support for a median of 13 (IQR 8, 20) calendar days. Compared with weekly reports during the pandemic, critical care mortality started higher than but then decreased below that of the first 200 consecutive patients. Duration of critical care, for both survivors and non-survivors increased over time; however, both were still lower than those for the first 200 consecutive patients. Receipt and duration of organ support increased to values similar to those for the first 200 consecutive patients. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 in critical care has high mortality and places a large burden on resources. Analysis of preliminary data with limited follow-up should be interpreted with caution, particularly for future planning in a pandemic.","Richards-Belle, Alvin; Orzechowska, Izabella; Doidge, James; Thomas, Karen; Harrison, David A; Koelewyn, Abby; Christian, Michael D; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Rowan, Kathryn M; Gould, Doug W",J Intensive Care Soc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7548541/,519

The government of Kuwait has taken several measures to minimize virus spread. The epidemic and measures to contain it will likely psychologically influence individuals. This study investigated the prevalence of anxiety and depression symptoms in Kuwaiti nationals and expats. The study’s secondary aim was to identify the association between sociodemographic characteristics and physical activity (PA) engagement, with psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 pandemic in Kuwait. A two-section survey was used to examine sociodemographic characteristics and PA engagement, and generalized anxiety (GAD-7) and depression symptoms (PHQ-9). RESULTS: Results of this study indicated that 53.7% and 59.6% of the respondents experienced anxiety and depression. The multiple regression models significantly predicted anxiety and depression (P < 0.001). In addition, PA, gender, education, and age were significantly associated with anxiety (P < .05), while PA, gender, age, and marital status were significantly associated with depression (P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that the COVID-19 outbreak may have a greater psychological impact on women, younger individuals, married people, and individuals with a bachelor’s degree. However, regular PA appears to be an important immediate and long-term factor in reducing symptoms of anxiety and depression during an epidemic.

Coronavirus pushes all community sectors: government, industry, academia, and nonprofit organizations to take forward steps to stop and control this pandemic. It is evident that IT-based solutions are urgent. This study is a small step in this direction, where health information is monitored and collected continuously. In this work, we build a network of smart nodes where each node comprises a Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) tag, reduced function RFID reader (RFRR), and sensors. The smart nodes are grouped in clusters, which are constructed periodically. The RFRR reader of the clusterhead collects data from its members, and once it is close to the primary reader, it conveys its data and so on. This approach reduces the primary RFID reader’s burden by receiving data from the clusterheads only instead of reading every tag when they pass by its vicinity. Besides, this mechanism reduces the channel access congestion; thus, it reduces the interference significantly. Furthermore, to protect the exchanged data from potential attacks, two levels of security algorithms, including an AES 128 bit with hashing, have been implemented. The proposed scheme has been validated via mathematical modeling using Integer programming, simulation, and prototype experimentation. The proposed technique shows low data delivery losses and a significant drop in transmission delay compared to contemporary approaches.","Abuelkhail, Abdulrahman; Baroudi, Uthman; Raad, Muhammad; Sheltami, Tarek",Wireless Netw,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7607371/,519

Therefore, the main aim of this paper was to determine the effects of priming an analytical or intuitive thinking style on the credulity of participants. In two experiments (N = 965), analytic thinking was induced and the source of fake profile (astrological reading vs. psychological testing) was manipulated and participants’ prior paranormal beliefs, anomalous explanation, cognitive reflection, and depression were measured. Although analytic thinking was proved to be hard to induce experimentally, the results showed that analytic thinking predicts credulity and belief in the paranormal was linked with experiencing more anomalous experiences and more paranormal explanations. The more people were able to think analytically, the less credulous they were as reflected in the lower acceptance of fake profile as accurate.","Ballová Mikušková, Eva; Čavojová, Vladimíra",Front Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7593255/,519
42323,Azithromycin/hydroxychloroquine: Cardiac disorder followed by off-label use: case report,2020-11-21,"ABSTRACT: To identify novel adenosine receptor (AR) ligands based on the chalcone scaffold, herein the synthesis, characterization and in vitro and in silico evaluation of 33 chalcones (15–36 and 37–41) and structurally related compounds (42–47) are reported. These compounds were characterized by radioligand binding and GTP shift assays to determine the degree and type of binding affinity, respectively, against rat (r) A(1) and A(2A) ARs. The chalcone derivatives 24, 29, 37 and 38 possessed selective A(1) affinity below 10 µM, and thus, are the most active compounds of the present series; compound 38 was the most potent selective A(1) AR antagonist (K(i) (r) = 1.6 µM). The structure–affinity relationships (SAR) revealed that the NH(2)-group at position C3 of ring A of the chalcone scaffold played a key role in affinity, and also, the Br-atom at position C3′ on benzylidene ring B. Upon in vitro and in silico evaluation, the novel C3 amino-substituted chalcone derivative 38—that contains an α,ß-unsaturated carbonyl system and easily allows structural modification—may possibly be a synthon in future drug discovery.

42329,"Enoxaparin sodium/methylprednisolone: Cytomegalovirus reactivation, gastrointestinal haemorrhage and off-label use: case report",2020-11-21,"A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Khartoum state to investigate the variation of antibody responses to Plasmodium falciparum 19-kDa C-terminal region of merozoite surface protein 1 antigen and the variation of human IL4 polymorphism with parasitaemia. Measurements of natural acquisition of anti-Plasmodium falciparum MSP1-19 IgG, IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies were performed using ELISA. Molecular characterization of IL4vntr polymorphism was achieved. We were able to detect a statistically significant negative correlation between parasitaemia and different age groups (r = − 0.262 and p value = 0.043) and with anti-P.fMSP1-19 IgG1 (r = − 0.418, p value = 0.047). Anti-P.fMSP1-19 IgG showed a significant difference among age groups (p < 0.001). Only anti-P.fMSP1-19 IgG showed a significant association with general appearance (p value < 0.001). The mean for total anti-P.fMSP1-19 IgG3 was statistically significantly higher in females compared to males (p value < 0.001). There was no significant difference in the distribution of human IL4 vntr genotypic and allelic frequencies between cases and control group as well as among different clinical manifestation.We concluded that IgG1 levels to MSP1-19 were found to be negatively correlated with parasitaemia and anti-PfMSP1-19 IgG was significantly increased in ill and severely ill with age considered as a cofactor. Further studies are needed to ascertain the role of IgG and IgG1 in protection and to investigate the IgG and subclasses’ response against other antigenic markers. These findings are valuable for advancing vaccine development by providing evidence supporting merozoite antigens as targets of protective immunity in humans.","Abushama, Hind M.; AbdelRahman, Inas A.; Ali, Hiba; Mowia, Tasneem; Mousa, Faisal; Abdelhamid, Muzamil M.; ElHassan, Ibrahim M.",J Parasit Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7671181/,519

43072,Hydroxychloroquine: Electrical storm and QT interval prolongation following off-label use: case report,2020-12-12,"BACKGROUND: Since the COVID-19 pandemic, thousands of medical procedures and appointments have been cancelled or delayed. The long-term effects of these drastic measures directly on brain tumour patients and their caregivers are unknown. The purpose of this study is to better understand how COVID-19 has affected this vulnerable population on a global scale. METHODS: An online 79-question survey was developed by the IBTA, in conjunction with the SNO COVID-19 Task Force. The survey was sent to over 120 brain tumour charities and not-for-profits worldwide and disseminated to brain tumour patients and caregivers. All responses were subdivided by patient vs caregiver and by geographical region. RESULTS: In total, 1989 participants completed the survey from 33 countries, including 1459 patients and 530 caregivers. There were no significant differences in COVID-19 testing rates (p = 0.662) or the number of positive cases for brain tumour patients between regions (p = 0.1068). Caregivers were significantly more anxious than patients (p = < 0.0001). Patients from the Americas were most likely to have lost their jobs due to the pandemic, practiced self-isolation, and received telehealth services (p = < 0.0001). Patients from Europe experienced the most treatment delays (p = 0.0031). Healthcare providers were ranked as the most trusted source of information. CONCLUSIONS: As a result of COVID-19, brain tumour patients and caregivers have experienced significant stress and anxiety. Healthcare professionals, brain tumour charities, and not-for-profits must ensure that they continue to provide accessible, high-quality care, information, and support in the age of COVID-19.","Voisin, Mathew; Oliver, Kathy; Farrimond, Stu; Chee, Tess; Zadeh, Gelareh",Neuro Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7650325/,519
44231,Hydroxychloroquine: Cardiac toxicity following off-label use: case report,2021-01-02,"BACKGROUND: Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a monoclonal antibody against the interleuikin-6 receptor which is potentially beneficial in COVID-19 induced cytokine release syndrome (CRS). However, there are limited studies showing anti-inflammatory effect and clinical benefit of TCZ in COVID-19 patients. This retrospective study examines treatment responses of criteria based TCZ therapy for SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infection for ICU vs. non-ICU patients. METHODS: We established institutional criteria to identify patients at risk of CRS from COVID-19. Patients were included if they received at least 1 dose of TCZ and were admitted for at least 72 hours. Primary endpoint was to assess clinical improvement (CI) at the end of admission. CI was defined by extubation, downgrade from ICU, discharged or improvement in Clinical Ordinal Scale by 2. Secondary endpoint of the study was to assess inpatient mortality (IM) and risk factors associated with IM. Subgroup analysis included impact of early (< 96 hours) vs late (≥ 96 hours) TCZ therapy on IM. RESULTS: Between March 25 to May 6, 2020, 170 patients met criteria and received TCZ. There were 83 non-ICU patients and 87 in the ICU. Forty five patients needed invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV). ICU patients tended to be obese, receive 2 doses of TCZ and have longer length of stay. Overall CI was seen in 71% of patients. CI was higher in non-ICU vs ICU patients (85.5% vs 57.5%, P=0.002). Overall IM was 18.8%; however, IM was lower in non-ICU vs ICU patients (8.4% vs 28.7%, P=0.0014). IM was higher in patients on IMV vs. non-IMV (30% vs 15.4%, P=0.03). Risk factors of ICU admission, BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 and AKI were associated with higher risk of IM. Many IM patients were made comfort care. No differences were observed in early vs late TCZ therapy on inpatient mortality, but there was a trend toward lower mortality with early TCZ. COS Review of Tocilizumab Patients [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: TCZ is an effective treatment option in patients with SARS-CoV-2 patients at risk of CRS. Patients receiving TCZ in non-ICU setting had a better response to treatment compared to ICU patients. Obesity and AKI were associated with higher risk of mortality, but there was no statistical difference in early vs late therapy. Further studies with control group and larger sample size are warranted.

44236,Hydroxychloroquine: Haemolysis following off-label use: case report,2021-01-02,"BACKGROUND: An increased appreciation for vaccines could be expected due to COVID-19. However, surveys show a polarization in opinions with about 20% of Americans preemptively rejecting any COVID-19 vaccine, partly due to inconsistent risk communication. While Health Care Professionals (HCPs) will be heavily relied upon to encourage uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine and 70% of Americans receive their vaccine information from HCPs, 84% also rely on peer networks. Understanding that HCPs have an important, but not exclusive, influence on health decision making can signal a new approach. This study provides data on where women, the main decision-makers regarding immunization in most families access information about vaccination. METHODS: Through an online survey conducted in UK, Brazil, Germany, Italy and Canada from 10 to 19-March 2020, we collected data on where, and from whom, women aged 25–54 years access information about vaccination. We set 1000 respondents/country quotas to reflect regional differences with data weighted as necessary. RESULTS: 5,036 women who met inclusion criteria responded: from the UK (1,003), Brazil (1,002), Germany (1,008), Italy (1,007), and Canada (1,016). Though most likely to receive vaccination info via their HCP: in Germany, women are least likely to be influenced by HCPs, with those aged 25–34 years more likely to turn to family members or online sources; in the UK, they are more likely to find info via a health authority’s website; and in Brazil, they are more likely to see info in traditional media and on Facebook. Only 50% ranked vaccine efficacy and disease risk in the Top 5 factors influencing their vaccine decisions, alongside the opinion of an HCP, recommendation of a Public Health Authority and impact of the disease. CONCLUSION: HCPs, families and peers are important sources of info regarding vaccination. COVID-19 is unlikely to improve vaccine confidence as the issue becomes increasingly polarized and communications more inconsistent. We can respond by investing in health promotion and harmonized communications through peer networks. Since caregivers, their families and peers have increased weight in vaccination decisions, then they should have increased weight in preventive health strategies.

VA’s large elderly population is at higher risk for influenza complications, including hospitalization and death. Herein we summarize VA’s 2019-20 national surveillance data for influenza activity and vaccinations. METHODS: Influenza telephone triage, influenza-like-illness (ILI) encounters and antiviral prescriptions plus outpatient visits, laboratory testing (antibody tests excluded), hospitalizations and deaths for influenza were obtained from VA data sources (9/29/19-5/16/20) and compared to prior seasons and national CDC FluView data. Influenza vaccinations were captured starting 8/1/2019. Vaccination rates were calculated based on VA users during the fiscal year. RESULTS: Surveillance metrics are presented (Table). ILI visits ranged from 0.9%-3.1% during the season. Influenza activity peaked during 2020 Weeks 6-7 and dropped rapidly beginning in Week 12, matching trends reported by CDC for influenza activity (Figure 1). Testing revealed 23,357 influenza positives out of 162,102 tests performed (14.4%). 17% of laboratory-confirmed influenza cases were hospitalized (compared to 23% during the prior season) with a median length of 3 days. Total influenza positives, telephone triage encounters, outpatient visits and antiviral use were higher than the prior season, whereas coded hospitalizations and deaths were fewer (Table, Figure 2).

[Image: see text] CONCLUSION: The 2019-20 influenza season was of moderate severity when compared to prior seasons and continues to track well with national CDC data. Overall, vaccination levels have increased modestly and high-dose/adjuvanted vaccine administration increased from 6 to 26% of total vaccine given over the seasons evaluated. Influenza activity dropped precipitously after Week 12 even though testing for influenza remained high in the setting of COVID-19. This may have been influenced by widespread social distancing and masking measures adopted in response to COVID-19.

44256,Clarithromycin/hydroxychloroquine/methylprednisolone: Off-label use and multivessel spontaneous coronary artery dissection: case report,2021-01-02,"BACKGROUND: While several studies have explored hospitalization risk factors with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection, the risk of poor outcomes during hospitalization has primarily relied upon laboratory or hospital-acquired data. Our goal was to identify clinical characteristics associated with intubation or death within 7 days of admission. METHODS: The first 436 patients admitted to the University of Colorado Hospital (Denver metropolitan area) with confirmed CoVID-19 were included. Demographics, comorbidities, and select medications were collected by chart abstraction. Missing height for calculating body mass index (BMI) was imputed using the median height for patients’ sex and race/ethnicity. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were estimated using multivariable logistic regression and a minimax concave penalty (MCP) regularized logistic regression explored prediction. RESULTS: Participants had a mean(SD) age 55(17), BMI 30.9(8.2), 55% were male and 80% were ethnic/racial minorities. Unadjusted comparisons by outcome are shown (Table 1). Male sex (aOR: 1.60, 95% CI (1.02, 2.54)), increasing age (aOR: 1.25(1.08, 1.47); per 10 years), higher BMI (aOR 1.03(1.00, 1.06) and poorly controlled diabetes (hemoglobin A1C ≥8) (aOR 2.33(1.27, 4.27) were significantly (p< 0.05) associated with greater odds of intubation or death. Minority status tended to be associated with higher odds (aOR:1.8(1.01,3.36); p=0.052). Surprisingly, need for hospital interpreter was associated with decreased odds (OR: 0.58(0.35, 0.95)) of intubation/death. Our final MCP model included indicators of A1C≥8, age >65, sex and minority status, but predicted intubation/death only slightly better than random chance (AUC= 0.61(0.56, 0.67)). Table 1. Patient Characteristics Stratified by Intubation and/or Death Within One Week of Admission (n=436) [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: In a hospitalized patient cohort with COVID-19, male sex, poorly controlled diabetes, increasing age and BMI were significantly associated with early intubation or death. These results complement larger cohort studies, and highlight risk differences across metropolitan areas with varying COVID-19 prevalence, demographics, and comorbid disease burden. Notably, our predictive model had limited success, which may suggest unmeasured factors also contribute to disease severity differences.

44265,Tocilizumab: Progression of multiple myeloma following off-label use: case report,2021-01-02,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel coronavirus that causes coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) and has been reported in > 98,000 children in the U.S (5% of reported cases) as of early June 2020. Most published literature focuses on adults with COVID-19, but little is understood on the impact of SARS-CoV-2 in children. We created a database for children with COVID-19 at Children’s Hospital Colorado (CHCO), a large tertiary care pediatric hospital, to better understand the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of this disease in children. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of all pediatric and youth patients with positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test results from March-May 2020. Univariate logistic regression models were used to identify predictors of hospital admission, need for critical care, and need for respiratory support among symptomatic patients, with p-values < 0.05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: We identified 246 patients with SARS-CoV-2 (age range: 17 days-25 years). We noted a Hispanic predominance with 68% of all patients with SARS-CoV-2 identifying as Hispanic or Latino, compared to 29% among all CHCO visits in 2019 (Figure 1). The most common symptoms at presentation were fever, cough, or shortness of breath in 94% of symptomatic patients. Sixty-eight patients (28%) were admitted, of which 7 (10%) required admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) for symptomatic COVID-19 disease (Figure 2). Age 0–3 months, certain symptoms at presentation, and several types of underlying medical conditions were predictors for both hospital admission and need for respiratory support (Figure 3). Initial and peak C-reactive protein (CRP) values were predictors for PICU admission with median peaks of 24.8mg/dL vs. 2.0mg/dL among PICU vs. non-PICU patients (OR 1.27, p=0.004). [Image: see text] [Image: see text] Figure 3: Predictors for Admission and Respiratory Support Requirement in CHCO Patients with SARS-CoV-2 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: There is a wide spectrum of illness in children with SARS-CoV-2, ranging from asymptomatic to critical illness. Hispanic ethnicity was disproportionately represented in our cohort, which requires further evaluation. We found that young age, comorbid conditions, and CRP appear to be risk factors for severe disease in children. DISCLOSURES: Kelly E.

44268,Azithromycin/hydroxychloroquine: QT prolongation and ventricular extrasystole secondary to off label use: case report,2021-01-02,"BACKGROUND: Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) can be serious complications of coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). Co-infections may worsen outcomes and prolong hospitalization. This risk may be exacerbated by systemic corticosteroids (steroids) and other adjunctive therapies. METHODS: We reviewed the records of all adults admitted to Stony Brook University Hospital, NY, from 3/1 to 4/15, 2020 with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, requiring high-ﬂow O2 (non-rebreather mask, Venturi mask with FiO2 >50%, or high-ﬂow nasal cannula). We excluded patients who received mechanical ventilation (MV) or died within 24h. Patients were followed until death or hospital discharge. We reviewed positive sputum cultures (PSC) for pathogenic microorganisms and calculated the incidence of HAP and VAP (nosocomial pneumonia, [NP]), rates of MV and impact on mortality. Fungi isolated from sputum, were considered colonization unless associated with fungemia. We also examined the impact of adjunctive therapies with immunosuppressive potential (steroids and tocilizumab), on HAP or VAP. RESULTS: A total of 469 patients were included (Table 1). Of these, 199 (42.4%) required intensive care and 172 (36.7%) MV. Median length of stay was 13 days (8–22) and 105 (22.4%) had PSC. Of these, 59 were considered true pathogens (HAP: 11, VAP: 48), with predominance of S. aureus (MSSA) 38.9%, Enterobacteriaceae 33.8% and Pseudomonas species 18.6%. 39 isolates were considered colonization (Table 2); Patients with PSC < 48h (N=7) from admission, were not considered NP. The incidence of NP was 7.0 per 1000 patient-days (95%CI 5.5–8.5). Of 11 patients with HAP, 9 needed MV. NP was more frequent among patients receiving steroids (9.0 vs 5.7 per 1000 patient-days; P=0.023). Use of tocilizumab was not associated with NP (6.2 vs 8.4 per 1000 patient-days; P=0.11). Mortality was nonsignificantly higher in patients with (20/59, 33.9%) vs. without (103/410, 25.1%) NP (P=0.16).

METHODS: We performed a retrospective observational study of data from a prospective registry from 2014 to 2018. A total of 2,499 adult patients with septic shock were enrolled. The primary outcome was 90-day mortality, and the secondary outcomes were the length of hospital stay, a requirement for mechanical ventilation or renal replacement therapy, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: Of 1,718 patients with septic shock, 1,012 (58.9%) patients were culture-positive (blood 803, urine 302, sputum 102, others 204) and the median pathogen detection time was 9.5 h (aerobic 10.2 h and anaerobic 9.0 h). The most common site of culture-positive infection was the hepatobiliary tract (39.5%), while for the culture-negative it was the lower respiratory tract (38.2%). The culture-negative group had a lower mean body temperature (37.3 vs 37.7 ℃), lactate (2.5 vs. 3.2 mmol/L), C-reactive protein (11.1 vs 11.9 mg/dL), and sequential organ failure assessment score (7.0 vs. 8.0) than that of the culture-positive group. However, 90-day mortality between the groups was not significantly different (32.7 vs 32.2%, p = 0.83), and the other clinical outcomes also did not differ significantly. Moreover, a shorter culture detection time was correlated with a higher sequential organ failure assessment score but not with mortality. CONCLUSION: Patients with septic shock are frequently culture-negative, especially in cases where the infection focus is in the lower respiratory tract. Although culture-negative was associated with a degree of organ dysfunction, it was not an independent predictor of death.","Kim, June-sung; Kim, Youn-Jung; Kim, Won Young",Crit Care,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7787242/,519

46126,Dexamethasone: Adrenal insufficiency following off-label use: case report,2021-02-27,"Clinically, fractional flow reserve (FFR)-guided coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is more effective than CABG guided by coronary angiography alone. However, no scholars have explained the mechanism from the perspective of hemodynamics. Two patients were clinically selected; their angiography showed 70% coronary stenosis, and the FFRs were 0.7 (patient 1) and 0.95 (patient 2). The FFR non-invasive computational model of the two patients was constructed by a 0–3D coupled multiscaled model, in order to verify that the model can accurately calculate the FFR results. Virtual bypass surgery was performed on these two stenoses, and a CABG multiscaled model was constructed. The flow rate of the graft and the stenosis coronary artery, as well as the wall shear stress (WSS) and the oscillatory shear index (OSI) in the graft were calculated. The non-invasive calculation results of FFR are 0.67 and 0.91, which are close to the clinical results, which proves that our model is accurate. According to the CABG model, the flow ratios of the stenosis coronary artery to the graft of patient 1 and patient 2 were 0.12 and 0.42, respectively. The time-average wall shear stress (TAWSS) results of patient 1 and patient 2 grafts were 2.09 and 2.16 Pa, respectively, and WSS showed uniform distribution on the grafts. The OSI results of patients 1 and 2 grafts were 0.0375 and 0.1264, respectively, and a significantly high OSI region appeared at the anastomosis of patient 2. The FFR value of the stenosis should be considered when performing bypass surgery. When the stenosis of high FFR values is grafted, a high OSI region is created at the graft, especially at the anastomosis. In the long term, this can cause anastomotic blockage and graft failure.","Li, Bao; Mao, Boyan; Feng, Yue; Liu, Jincheng; Zhao, Zhou; Duan, Mengyao; Liu, Youjun",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7892768/,519

48458,Hydroxychloroquine: Elevated aminotransferase levels following off-label use: case report,2021-03-20,"In today’s electronic society, security of information is an issue of major concern especially in the communication domain. Indeed, there is a very serious need for schemes that guarantee security of information exchanged between entities, over public networks. Several techniques such as cryptography and/or steganography have been proposed in existing literature. Audio steganography has certain advantages over conventional steganography. Existing audio steganography systems suffer from limitations that includes, their inability to embed information in multiple audio file formats, high distortion rate and low level of robustness of their resultant stego-files. To overcome these limitations, this current research focused on the development of an efficient and robust audio steganography system for the security of information whether in store or on transit across the Internet. This is achieved by first encrypting a given secret information, compressing the resultant cipher-text, then embedding the compressed file in a suitable cover (audio file) using frequency hopping spread spectrum technique, to yield as output, an audio stego file which is not distinguishable from the original audio cover file. To allow for the embedding of the secret compressed file, the selected audio cover file is first broken into frames using one dimensional Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Results of performance evaluation of this developed system shows that it has very low level of distortion as revealed by the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). The compression ratio obtained is also equal to one (1), which shows that the cover audio file is identical to the resultant stego-file.","Adeboje, Olawale Timothy; Gabriel, Arome Junior; Adetunmbi, Adebayo Olusola",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7974983/,519

So far, we possess few data to understand the effect of the CoViD-19 on emergency surgery. AIM: To compare the total number of patients who were referred, admitted, and had an emergency operation under General Surgery (GS) between March and May 2020, to the same period between 2016-19. METHOD: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected local data from surgical take lists and operative data obtained from the hospital’s Business Intelligence Team. RESULTS: A 22.4% reduction was seen in the referrals per day 15.18+/-2.45 vs. 11.77 +/- 4.54 (2016-9 vs. 2020, mean+/-SD) and a 36% reduction in admissions per day 7.40 +/-1.07 vs. 4.69+/- 2.03 (2016-9 vs. 2020, mean+/-SD). A 55% reduction in the total number of emergency operations during the CoViD-19 outbreak was observed 87 (total, 2020) vs. 194+/-35.96 (mean+/-SD, 2016-19). CONCLUSIONS: CoViD-19 had a significant impact on the number of patients presenting to GS. Interestingly, an even greater reduction in operative treatment was also observed. This may reflect reduction in theatre availability or use of a higher threshold for conservative treatment.","Chatzikonstantinou, M; David, M; Pouncey, A; Aljarad, F; Sorelli, P",Br J Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8135811/,519

Zero-day attack(s) targeting unknown vulnerabilities of a software or system opens up further research direction in the field of cyber-attacks. Existing approaches either uses ML/DNN or anomaly-based approach to protect against these attacks. Detecting zero-day attacks through these techniques miss several parameters like frequency of particular byte streams in network traffic and their correlation. Covering attacks that produce lower traffic is difficult through neural network models because it requires higher traffic for correct prediction. This paper proposes a novel robust and intelligent cyber-attack detection model to cover the issues mentioned above using the concept of heavy-hitter and graph technique to detect zero-day attacks. The proposed work consists of two phases (a) Signature generation and (b) Evaluation phase. This model evaluates the performance using generated signatures at the training phase. The result analysis of the proposed zero-day attack detection shows higher performance for accuracy of 91.33% for the binary classification and accuracy of 90.35% for multi-class classification on real-time attack data. The performance against benchmark data set CICIDS18 shows a promising result of 91.62% for binary-class classification on this model. Thus, the proposed approach shows an encouraging result to detect zero-day attacks.","Kumar, Vikash; Sinha, Ditipriya",Complex Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8160422/,519
53826,Hydroxychloroquine: Lack of efficacy following an off-label use: case report,2021-06-05,"Bioelectrical impedance vector analysis (BIVA) is a method used to estimate variation in body hydration. We assessed the potential of BIVA for monitoring daily body hydration fluctuations in nine healthy, normally active males under matching normoxic (NX) and hypobaric hypoxic (HH) experimental conditions. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate whether changes in BIVA may correspond with the development of acute mountain sickness (AMS). Subjects were exposed in a hypobaric chamber to both NX (corresponding to an altitude of 262 m) and HH conditions corresponding to an altitude of 3500 m during two four-day sojourns within which food, water intake and physical activity were controlled. Bioimpedance and body weight measurements were performed three times a day and medical symptoms were assessed every morning using the Lake Louise score (LLS). Total body water (TBW) was also assessed on the last day of both sojourns using the deuterium dilution technique. We detected circadian changes in vector length, indicating circadian body water variations that did not differ between NX and HH conditions (ANOVA effects: time: p = 0.018, eta(2) = 0.149; interaction: p = 0.214, eta(2) = 0.083; condition: p = 0.920, eta(2) = 0.001). Even though none of the subjects developed AMS, four subjects showed clinical symptoms according to the LLS during the first 24 hours of HH conditions. These subjects showed a pronounced (Cohen’s d: 1.09), yet not statistically significant (p = 0.206) decrease in phase angle 6 hours after exposure, which may indicate fluid shift from the intracellular to the extracellular compartment. At the end of each sojourn, vector length correlated with deuterium dilution TBW “gold standard” measurements (linear regression: NX: p = 0.002 and r(2) = 0.756, HH: p < 0.001 and r(2) = 0.84). BIVA can be considered a valuable method for monitoring body hydration changes at altitude. Whether such changes are related to the development of clinical symptoms associated with AMS, as indicated in the present investigation, must be confirmed in future studies.","Regli, Ivo B.; Turner, Rachel; Woyke, Simon; Rauch, Simon; Brugger, Hermann; Gatterer, Hannes",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8161038/,519

In the first wave of infections, the most extreme strategies included large‐scale national and regional lockdowns or stay‐at‐home orders. One major side effect of large‐scale lockdowns was the shuttering of the economy, leading to massive layoffs, loss of income, and livelihood. Lockdowns were justified in part by scientific models (computer forecast and simulations) that assumed exponential growth in infections and predicted millions of fatalities without these ‘non‐pharmaceutical interventions’ (NPI). Some scientists questioned these assumptions. Regions that followed other softer mitigation strategies such as work from home, crowd limits, use of masks, individual quarantining, basic social distancing, testing, and tracing – at least in the first wave of infections – saw similar health outcomes. Clear results were confusing, complicated, and difficult to assess. Ultimately, in the USA, what kind of mitigation strategy was enforced became a political decision only partly based on scientific models. We do not test for what levels of NPI are necessary for appropriate management of the first wave of the pandemic. Rather we use the ‘inverse‐fitting Gompertz function’ methodology suggested by anti‐lockdown advocate and Nobel Laureate Dr. Levitts to estimate the rate of growth/decline in COVID‐19 infections as well to determine when disease peaking occurred. Our estimates may help predict levels of first‐wave infections in the future and help a region to monitor new outbreaks prior to opening its economy. The inverse fitting function is applied to the first wave of infections in the USA and in the hard‐hit New York and New Jersey regions for the time period March to June 2020. This is the earliest days of pandemic in the USA. The estimates for the rates of growth/decline are computed and used to predict underlying future infections, so that decision makers can monitor the disease threat as they open their economies. This preliminary and exploratory analysis and findings are discussed briefly and presented primarily in charts and tables, but the following waves of disease diffusion are not included and certainly were not anticipated.","Haynes, Kingsley E.; Kulkarni, Rajendra",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8250709/,519

Although the ClinicalTrials.gov initiative has resulted in a rich source of information for clinical trial research, only a handful of analytic studies have been carried out to understand this valuable data source. Analysis of this database provides insight for emerging trends of clinical research. In this study, we propose to use network analysis to understand infectious disease clinical trial research. Our goal is to understand two important issues related to the clinical trials: (1) the concentrations and characteristics of infectious disease clinical trial research, and (2) recommendation of clinical trials to a sponsor (or an investigator). The first issue helps summarize clinical trial research related to a particular disease(s), and the second issue helps match clinical trial sponsors and investigators for information recommendation. By using 4228 clinical trials as the test bed, our study investigates 4864 sponsors and 1879 research areas characterized by Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) keywords. We use a network to characterize infectious disease clinical trials, and design a new community-topic-based link prediction approach to predict sponsors’ interests. Our design relies on network modeling of both clinical trial sponsors and keywords. For sponsors, we extract communities with each community consisting of sponsors with coherent interests. For keywords, we extract topics with each topic containing semantic consistent keywords. The communities and topics are combined for accurate clinical trial recommendation. This transformative study concludes that using network analysis can tremendously help the understanding of clinical trial research for effective summarization, characterization, and prediction.","Elkin, Magdalyn E.; Zhu, Xingquan",Netw Model Anal Health Inform Bioinform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8262767/,519

In this paper, we investigate that a group of independent workers willingly form a workers coalition by pooling their capacities together to jointly complete a crowdsourcing task, with the goal of being to obtain a reward from an employer. The capacity pooling games in the crowdsourcing service setting are formulated as optimization problems. Using the duality theory of a linear program, we not only establish that the core of the capacity pooling game is nonempty but also provide a simple way to compute a fair profit allocation policy in the bidding mode, employment mode and contrast mode of crowdsurcing services, respectively. Then, we further analyze the capacity pooling games with concave investment cost and convex quality reward structures, which exhibit the economies of scale and quality incentives. More interestingly, we give a constructive proof to the nonemptiness of the core of the resulting capacity pooling game with nonlinear structures.","Shi, Zhanwen; Cao, Erbao; Nie, Kai",Electron Commer Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8286052/,519
56356,Multiple drugs: No response and off-label use: 2 case report,2021-07-31,"Despite the improvement in technologies for the production of alternative fuels (AFs), and the needs for using more AFs for motor vehicles for the reductions in air pollution and greenhouse gases, the number of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) in the global transportation sector has not been increasing significantly (there are even small drops for adapting some AFs through the projections) in recent years and even in the near future with projections to 2050. And gasoline and diesel fuels will remain as the main energy sources for motor vehicles. After reviewing the latest advantages and disadvantages of AFVs, including flexible-fuel, gas, electric, hybrid electric, and fuel cell electric vehicles, it is found that the higher price of AFVs, compared to that of gasoline and diesel vehicles, might be one of the main barriers for their wider adoption. But on the other hand, there is the “chicken and egg” problem. Because people mostly do not select AFVs due to their higher price and sometimes their less infrastructure availability compared to those of gasoline and diesel vehicles, however, governments and AFVs manufacturers claim that the insignificant demand volume and less interest by people to purchase them, is one of the main reasons for a higher price and less infrastructure availability of AFVs. So, what should we do for adopting AFVs? This review shows that there are two very important and fundamental points that might cause a rise in the demand and usage of AFVs, rather than waiting for the reduction in AFVs prices. Those points are car salespeople's and people's knowledge about AFVs and the environmental issues, and their encouragement to accept and use AFVs. Although the AFVs are available on the market for many years, many people around the world have no/less/old/wrong knowledge about the current AFVs. Thus, most of these people reject these vehicles for usage, even when their important parameters such as purchase price, operating cost, driving range, and fuel availability be the same (or close) as those of gasoline or diesel vehicles. Detailed information, examples, and recommendations to the increases in people's knowledge and encouragement are presented in this review.","Ghadikolaei, Meisam Ahmadi; Wong, Pak Kin; Cheung, Chun Shun; Zhao, Jing; Ning, Zhi; Yung, Ka-Fu; Wong, Hang Cheong; Gali, Nirmal Kumar",Heliyon,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8313498/,519
