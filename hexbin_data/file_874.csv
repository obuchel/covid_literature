A critical assessment of the response to this calamity and its impact on healthcare workers (HCWs) and patient care in a dedicated cancer hospital is analyzed. SITE OF STUDY Indrayani Cancer Hospital, Alandi, Pune, India. MATERIALS AND METHODS Due to the pandemic, standard operating protocols were decided on for each department. Analysis of the impact on healthcare was done by comparing the number of patients taking treatment in the lockdown period in India with the previous year's data in the same corresponding period in all three departments. The impact of COVID infection on the HCW and its repercussions were analyzed. RESULTS There was a marked decrease in the total number of patients during the lockdown period. The most affected department was surgical oncology. None of our patients contracted COVID-19, but one HCW was found to be positive. CONCLUSION Strict adherence to protocols along with the support of the government authorities can prevent the spread of this virus thus providing optimal patient outcomes. The treatment of patients with cancer should not be delayed, even in times of a pandemic.","Deshmukh, Sanjay; Naik, Shailesh; Zade, Bhooshan; Patwa, Raunak; Gawande, Jayant; Watgaonkar, Ravi; Wagh, Sachin; Deshmukh, Sonali; Gautam, Pratik; Gandhi, Vidhyachandra; Ankolikar, Shrikant; Gosavi, Nitin",Journal of surgical oncology,874,1

Although beneficial or detrimental contributions of ASC to CNS diseases remain to be defined, virus-specific ASC are crucial in controlling persistent CNS infection following coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis. This report characterizes expression kinetics of factors associated with ASC homing, differentiation, and survival in the spinal cord, the prominent site of coronavirus persistence. Infection induced a vast, gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-dependent, prolonged increase in chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 9 (CXCL9), CXCL10, and CXCL11 mRNA, supporting a role for chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 3 (CXCR3)-mediated ASC recruitment. Similarly, CD4 T cell-secreted interleukin-21, a critical regulator of both peripheral activated B cells and CD8 T cells, was sustained during viral persistence. The ASC survival factors B cell-activating factor of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family (BAFF) and a proliferating-inducing ligand (APRIL) were also significantly elevated in the infected CNS, albeit delayed relative to the chemokines. Unlike IFN-γ-dependent BAFF upregulation, APRIL induction was IFN-γ independent. Moreover, both APRIL and BAFF were predominantly localized to astrocytes. Last, the expression kinetics of the APRIL and BAFF receptors coincided with CNS accumulation of ASC. Therefore, the factors associated with ASC migration, differentiation, and survival are all induced during acute viral encephalomyelitis, prior to ASC accumulation in the CNS. Importantly, the CNS expression kinetics implicate rapid establishment, and subsequent maintenance, of an environment capable of supporting differentiation and survival of protective antiviral ASC, recruited as plasmablasts from lymphoid organs.","Phares, Timothy W; Marques, Cristina P; Stohlman, Stephen A; Hinton, David R; Bergmann, Cornelia C",Journal of virology,874,1

Eighteen dogs and six cats with urinary retention were examined and scored before treatment on the degree of difficulty of inducing bladder emptying by manual bladder compression. Animals were subsequently treated in a blinded fashion by the same operator with urethral infusion of 2-4 ml of either a solution of 0.5 mg/ml of atracurium (treatment group) or placebo (control group) and, after five minutes, a second attempt was made to induce bladder emptying by manual compression and a post-treatment score assigned. Pretreatment scores did not differ between the treatment and control groups (5.6±0.8 v 6.2±0.7, respectively; P=0.22); however, post-treatment scores were significantly lower in the treatment group compared with the control group (2.9±0.4 v 5.9±0.3; P<0.05). Urethral infusion of atracurium facilitates manual bladder expression in dogs and cats with urinary retention secondary to spinal cord injuries.

Of >70 known TRIMs, TRIM56 inhibits replication of bovine viral diarrhea virus, a ruminant pestivirus of the family Flaviviridae, but has no appreciable effect on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a rhabdovirus. Yet the antiviral spectrum of TRIM56 remains undefined. In particular, how TRIM56 impacts human-pathogenic viruses is unknown. Also unclear are the molecular determinants governing the antiviral activities of TRIM56. Herein, we show that TRIM56 poses a barrier to infections by yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2), and human coronavirus virus (HCoV) OC43 but not encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV). Moreover, by engineering cell lines conditionally expressing various TRIM56 mutants, we demonstrated that TRIM56's antiflavivirus effects required both the E3 ligase activity that lies in the N-terminal RING domain and the integrity of its C-terminal portion, while the restriction of HCoV-OC43 relied upon the TRIM56 E3 ligase activity alone. Furthermore, TRIM56 was revealed to impair YFV and DENV2 propagation by suppressing intracellular viral RNA accumulation but to compromise HCoV-OC43 infection at a later step in the viral life cycle, suggesting that distinct TRIM56 domains accommodate differing antiviral mechanisms. Altogether, TRIM56 is a versatile antiviral host factor that confers resistance to YFV, DENV2, and HCoV-OC43 through overlapping and distinct molecular determinants. IMPORTANCE We previously reported tripartite motif protein 56 (TRIM56) as a host restriction factor of bovine viral diarrhea virus, a ruminant pathogen. However, the impact of TRIM56 on human-pathogenic RNA viruses is unknown. Herein, we demonstrate that TRIM56 restricts two medically important flaviviruses, yellow fever virus (YFV) and dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2), and a human coronavirus, HCoV-OC43, but not encephalomyocarditis virus, a picornavirus. Further, we show that TRIM56-mediated inhibition of HCoV-OC43 multiplication depends solely on its E3 ligase activity, whereas its restriction of YFV and DENV2 requires both the E3 ligase activity and integrity of the C-terminal portion. The differing molecular determinants appear to accommodate distinct antiviral mechanisms TRIM56 adopts to target different families of viruses; while TRIM56 curbs intracellular YFV/DENV2 RNA replication, it acts at a later step in HCoV-OC43 life cycle. These novel findings illuminate the molecular basis of the versatility and specificity of TRIM56's antiviral activities against positive-strand RNA viruses.","Liu, Baoming; Li, Nan L; Wang, Jie; Shi, Pei-Yong; Wang, Tianyi; Miller, Mark A; Li, Kui",Journal of virology,874,31
125719,125719,125719,[Clinical analysis of the first patient with imported Middle East respiratory syndrome in China].,15.473975,15.799539,2015,"Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) are the most widely studied and applied ablation techniques for treating primary and secondary liver tumors. These techniques are considered curative for small hepatic tumors, with post-ablation outcomes most commonly assessed by an imaging follow up. However, there is increasing evidence of a discrepancy between radiological and pathological findings when ablated lesions are evaluated following liver resection or liver transplantation. A comprehensive review of the available literature reporting the complete pathological response (cPR) following RFA and MWA was performed to estimate the success rate and identify the factors associated with treatment failure. Following RFA, cPR is reported in 26-96% of tumors compared to 57-95% with MWA. Larger tumor size and vessels larger than 3 mm adjacent to the treated tumor are the most important factors identified by previous studies associated with viable residual tumors after RFA. Correlating post-ablation radiological studies with pathological findings shows that computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have low sensitivity but high specificity for detecting residual viable or recurrent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) tumors. There are promising recent reports combining multiprobe ablation techniques with three-dimensional treatment planning software and stereotactic-aiming instrumentation to achieve more than 90% cPR in both small and large HCC tumors. In conclusion, the reported success for achieving cPR in HCC following RFA and MWA is highly variable in different studies and decreases with increasing lesion size and unfavorable tumor characteristics. Very few studies have reported a high rate of cPR. As these studies are single-center and retrospective, they need to be further validated and reproduced in other clinical settings.","Habibollahi, Peiman; Sheth, Rahul A; Cressman, Erik N K",Cancers,874,1

AIM To determine the factors associated with a low quality of life during COVID 19 quarantine in Chilean adults. MATERIAL AND METHODS The SF-36 survey about quality of life was answered by 1,082 Chilean adults aged between 18 and 60 years, who were quarantined by the COVID-19 health alert. Other variables studied were sociodemographic background, nutritional status, lifestyles, level of physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep hours. Risk factors associated with low quality of life were identified by logistic regression analysis for each of the 8 dimensions evaluated in the SF-36 questionnaire. RESULTS The factors that increased the probability of having a lower general health perception were being female (Odds ratio (OR) = 1.29; p = 0.05), being physically inactive (OR = 2.76 p < 0.01), unhealthy hours of sleep (OR = 1.58, p < 0.01), smoking (OR = 1.59, p < 0.01) and eating junk food (OR = 2.26; p < 0.01). For the other dimensions of quality of life, the most frequently repeated factors were being female, junk food consumption, and being physically inactive and sedentary. CONCLUSIONS There are factors associated with a low quality of life during the quarantine of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Chilean population. Their identification could reinforce remedial actions at the government level to benefit the health of the population during this health emergency.","Guzmán-Muñoz, Eduardo; Concha-Cisternas, Yeny; Oñate-Barahona, Ariel; Lira-Cea, Carlos; Cigarroa-Cuevas, Igor; Méndez-Rebolledo, Guillermo; Castillo-Retamal, Marcelo; Valdés-Badilla, Pablo; Zapata-Lamana, Rafael",Revista medica de Chile,874,1

OBJECTIVES To assess the impact of the local COVID-19 outbreak on routine child health services. METHODS The District Health Information System data set for KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) provincial health services was accessed, and monthly child health-related data were extracted for the period January 2018 - June 2020. Chronological and geographical variations in sentinel indicators for service access, service delivery and the wellbeing of children were assessed. RESULTS During April - June 2020, following the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in KZN, significant declines were seen for clinic attendance (36%; p=0.001) and hospital admissions (50%; p=0.005) of children aged <5 years, with a modest recovery in clinic attendance only. Among service delivery indicators, immunisation coverage recovered most rapidly, with vitamin A supplementation, deworming and food supplementation remaining low. Changes were less pronounced for in- and out-of-hospital births and uptake rates of infant polymerase chain reaction testing for HIV at birth, albeit with wide interdistrict variations, indicating inequalities in access to and provision of maternal and neonatal care. A temporary 47% increase in neonatal facility deaths was reported in May 2020 that could potentially be attributed to COVID-19-related disruption and diversion of health resources. CONCLUSIONS Multiple indicators demonstrated disruption in service access, service delivery and child wellbeing. Further studies are needed to establish the intermediate- and long-term impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on child health, as well as strategies to mitigate these.","Jensen, C; McKerrow, N H",South African medical journal = Suid-Afrikaanse tydskrif vir geneeskunde,874,1

The present study proposes that the RNAs of this virus might be infectious and that the transmission of these RNAs might be one route of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. I speculate that SARS-CoV-2 RNAs are infectious based on the following rationale and offer a putative mechanism: RNA is the most important biomolecule of the novel coronavirus for expression and replication, free RNA strands of SARS-CoV-2 have the potential to remain suspended in the air and retain their biological activity, and some exogenous RNAs can enter the host cell after contact. Further studies are needed in order to verify this hypothesis. It is worthwhile to compare the effects of SARS-CoV-2 components (e.g., virus particles, positive RNA strands, negative RNA strands, and virus proteins) with symptoms to study the mechanism of asymptomatic infection. If additional detection results show that the proportion of RNA in the environment is higher than the proportion of RNA in the novel coronavirus particles, this would suggest the potential presence of free RNA genomes of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment. Research on the temporal and spatial distribution of infectious SARS-CoV-2 RNA strands is necessary. The nucleic acid test of SARS-CoV-2 should target not only positive RNA strands but also negative RNA strands. For medical purposes, studying environmental RNAs (eRNAs) is important. I believe that further investigation of the infection capabilities of viral RNAs will yield useful information.","Xu, Zhongneng",J Infect Dev Ctries,874,0

The present study investigated the withanolides as an immune booster and anti-viral agents against the coronavirus-19. Withanolides from Withania somnifera were retrieved from the open-source database, their targets were predicted using DIGEP-Pred, and the protein-protein interaction was evaluated. The drug-likeness score and intestinal absorptivity of each compound were also predicted. The network of compounds, proteins, and modulated pathways was constructed using Cytoscape, and docking was performed using autodock4.0, and selected protein-ligand complexes were subjected to 100 ns Molecular Dynamics simulations. The molecular dynamics trajectories were subjected to free energy calculation by the MM-GBSA method. Withanolide_Q was predicted to modulate the highest number of proteins, showed human intestinal absorption, and was predicted for the highest drug-likeness score. Similarly, combined network interaction identified Withanolide_Q to target the highest number of proteins; RAC1 was majorly targeted, and fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis associated pathway were chiefly regulated. Similarly, Withanolide_D and Withanolide_G were predicted to have a better binding affinity with PLpro, Withanolide_M with 3CLpro, and Withanolide_M with spike protein based on binding energy and number of hydrogen bond interactions. MD studies suggested Withanoside_I with the highest binding free energy (&#916;Gbind-31.56 kcal/mol) as the most promising inhibitor. Among multiple withanolides from W. somnifera, Withanolide_D, Withanolide_G, Withanolide_M, and Withanolide_Q were predicted as the lead hits based on drug-likeness score, modulated proteins, and docking score to boost the immune system and inhibit the COVID-19 infection, which could primarily act against COVID-19. Highlights Withanolides are immunity boosters. Withanolides are a group of bio-actives with potential anti-viral properties.

Beside acute respiratory distress syndrome found in acute phase of infection, there is also pulmonary fibrosis as a chronic complication due to COVID-19. With the global pandemic of COVID-19, more and more autopsy and puncture histopathological results have been published.Until now there is no specific therapy to handle post-inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis due to COVID-19 infection. Several studies are ongoing to determine an effective treatment for this chronic complication. While ARDS appears to be the main cause of pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19, the pathogenesis of ARDS caused by SARS-CoV-2 is different from the typical ARDS. Some therapies may be considered for reducing the fibrosis process in lung after COVI-19 infection namely pirfenidone, nintedanib and mesenchymal stem cells. Many patients are still recovering spontaneously in the first six weeks after acute COVID-19 infection and do not generally require fast-track entry into a pulmonary rehabilitation programme. However, those who have significantly persistent respiratory illness may need to be supported by pulmonary rehabilitation. Multidisciplinary intervention based on personalized evaluation and treatment which includes exercise training, education and behavioral modification can be given to improve the physical and psychological condition of patients with post-COVID pulmonary fibrosis.","Rumende, C.

Yet, we perceive vivid illusory motion in stationary, periodic luminance gradients that contain no true motion. This illusion is shared by diverse vertebrate species, but theories proposed to explain this illusion have remained difficult to test. Here, we demonstrate that in the fruit fly Drosophila, the illusory motion percept is generated by unbalanced contributions of direction-selective neurons' responses to stationary edges. First, we found that flies, like humans, perceive sustained motion in the stationary gradients. The percept was abolished when the elementary motion detector neurons T4 and T5 were silenced. In vivo calcium imaging revealed that T4 and T5 neurons encode the location and polarity of stationary edges. Furthermore, our proposed mechanistic model allowed us to predictably manipulate both the magnitude and direction of the fly's illusory percept by selectively silencing either T4 or T5 neurons. Interestingly, human brains possess the same mechanistic ingredients that drive our model in flies. When we adapted human observers to moving light edges or dark edges, we could manipulate the magnitude and direction of their percepts as well, suggesting that mechanisms similar to the fly's may also underlie this illusion in humans. By taking a comparative approach that exploits Drosophila neurogenetics, our results provide a causal, mechanistic account for a long-known visual illusion. These results argue that this illusion arises from architectures for motion detection that are shared across phyla.","Agrochao, Margarida; Tanaka, Ryosuke; Salazar-Gatzimas, Emilio; Clark, Damon A",Proc.

Currently, most efforts on supporting the uptake of digital mental health tools remain fragmented across organizations and geography. There is a critical need to synthesize these efforts in order to provide a coordinated strategy of supporting the adoption of digital mental health tools. OBJECTIVE: The specific aim of this project is to develop a web-based resource document to support the engagement of mental health providers and patients in the use of digital mental health tools. METHODS: The web-based resource was developed using a multimethod approach. A grey literature review was conducted in 2019 to identify relevant toolkits that are available in the public domain. This was supplemented with an environmental scan where individuals with expertise in the development, acquisition, implementation, and evaluation of digital mental health tools were invited to contribute additional tools or documents not identified in the grey literature search. An engagement workshop was held with stakeholders to explore how the resource document should be developed and delivered. These findings were collectively used to develop the final iteration of the resource document. RESULTS: Based on a gray literature review and environmental scan with 27 experts, 25 resources were identified and included in the resource guide. These resources were developed for patients and providers by organizations from 5 countries. An engagement workshop was held with 14 stakeholders, and barriers related to cultural sensitivity, sustainability, and accessibility of the toolkit were identified. The final iteration of the resource document was developed by the research team using findings from the gray literature review, environmental scan, and engagement workshop. The contents of the 45-page resource guide are directed at mental health care providers, administrators, and patients (inclusive of families and caregivers). CONCLUSIONS: The use of a multimethod approach led to the development of a resource guide that builds on existing evidence on digital mental health tools and was co-designed with stakeholders and end-users. The resource guide is now publicly available online for free and is being promoted through digital health and mental health websites. Future work should explore how this document can be integrated into clinical care delivery and pathways.","Strudwick, Gillian; McLay, David; Lo, Brian; Shin, Hwayeon Danielle; Currie, Leanne; Thomson, Nicole; Maillet, Éric; Strong, Vanessa; Miller, Alanna; Shen, Nelson; Campbell, Janis",J Med Internet Res,874,11
