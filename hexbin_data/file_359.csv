2518,The utility of margin-reflex distance in determining the type of surgical intervention for congenital blepharoptosis,2016-10-11,"AIMS: To evaluate the utility of margin-reflex distance (MRD) as an alternative to levator function (LF) in choosing the appropriate surgical procedure for congenital blepharoptosis. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a retrospective, observational study. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Records of patients with simple (dystrophic) congenital ptosis who were operated and followed for ≥6 months postoperatively and whose outcomes were deemed as successful were evaluated in the study. Success was defined as a MRD at the last postoperative visit of ≥3 mm. In all cases, levator resection was performed when LF was >4 mm and frontalis suspension when LF was ≤4 mm. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: For statistical evaluations, LF was accepted as the gold standard parameter for deciding on the surgical intervention, and the optimum cutoff point for initial MRD was determined as the point at which sensitivity and specificity was highest at the receiving operating curve for the selection of surgical procedure. RESULTS: Of one hundred and three eyes of ninety patients (44 female/46 male), levator resection was used in 44.7% and frontalis suspension in 55.3%. When the optimum cutoff point for MRD was determined as 0.5 mm, the sensitivity was 71%, specificity was 86%, and the area under the curve that represented the discriminative power of this parameter was found to be 0.826. CONCLUSION: The MRD at the cutoff point of 0.5 mm may be used as an alternative to LF to determine the type of surgical intervention in patients with congenital blepharoptosis whose LF cannot be reliably obtained in clinical evaluations.","Ural, Ozlem; Mocan, Mehmet Cem; Dolgun, Anıl; Erdener, Ugur",Indian J Ophthalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5168917/,359
2618,"A systematic review of the clinical presentation, treatment and relapse characteristics of human Plasmodium ovale malaria",2017-03-11,"BACKGROUND: Despite increased efforts to control and ultimately eradicate human malaria, Plasmodium ovale malaria is for the most part outside the focus of research or public health programmes. Importantly, the understanding of P. ovale—nowadays regarded as the two distinct species P. ovale wallikeri and P. ovale curtisi—largely stems from case reports and case series lacking study designs providing high quality evidence. Consecutively, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of the clinical presentation, appropriate treatment and relapse characteristics of P. ovale malaria. The aim of this systematic review is to provide a systematic appraisal of the current evidence for severe manifestations, relapse characteristics and treatment options for human P. ovale malaria. METHODS AND RESULTS: This systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA guidelines and registered in the international prospective register for systematic reviews (PROSPERO 2016:CRD42016039214). P. ovale mono-infection was a strict inclusion criterion. Of 3454 articles identified by the literature search, 33 articles published between 1922 and 2015 met the inclusion criteria. These articles did not include randomized controlled trials. Five prospective uncontrolled clinical trials were performed on a total of 58 participants. P. ovale was sensitive to all tested drugs within the follow-up periods and on interpretable in vitro assays. Since its first description in 1922, only 18 relapsing cases of P. ovale with a total of 28 relapse events were identified in the scientific literature. There was however no molecular evidence for a causal relationship between dormant liver stages and subsequent relapses. A total of 22 severe cases of P. ovale malaria were published out of which five were fatal. Additionally, two cases of congenital P. ovale malaria were reported. CONCLUSIONS: Current knowledge of P. ovale malaria is based on small trials with minor impact, case reports and clinical observations. This systematic review highlights that P. ovale is capable of causing severe disease, severe congenital malaria and may even lead to death. Evidence for relapses in patients with P. ovale malaria adds up to only a handful of cases. Nearly 100 years after P. ovale’s first description by Stephens the evidence for the clinical characteristics, relapse potential and optimal treatments for P. ovale malaria is still scarce.

10653,Survey-based Work System Assessment to Facilitate Large-scale Dissemination of Healthcare Quality Improvement Programs,2020-04-09,"INTRODUCTION: Pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrests and emergent transfers to the pediatric intensive care unit (ICU) represent a serious patient safety concern with associated increased morbidity and mortality. Some institutions have turned to the electronic health record and predictive analytics in search of earlier and more accurate detection of patients at risk for decompensation. METHODS: Objective electronic health record data from 2011 to 2017 was utilized to develop an automated early warning system score aimed at identifying hospitalized children at risk of clinical deterioration. Five vital sign measurements and supplemental oxygen requirement data were used to build the Vitals Risk Index (VRI) model, using multivariate logistic regression. We compared the VRI to the hospital’s existing early warning system, an adaptation of Monaghan’s Pediatric Early Warning Score system (PEWS). The patient population included hospitalized children 18 years of age and younger while being cared for outside of the ICU. This dataset included 158 case hospitalizations (102 emergent transfers to the ICU and 56 “code blue” events) and 135,597 control hospitalizations. RESULTS: When identifying deteriorating patients 2 hours before an event, there was no significant difference between Pediatric Early Warning Score and VRI’s areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve at false-positive rates ≤ 10% (pAUC(10) of 0.065 and 0.064, respectively; P = 0.74), a threshold chosen to compare the 2 approaches under clinically tolerable false-positive rates. CONCLUSIONS: The VRI represents an objective, simple, and automated predictive analytics tool for identifying hospitalized pediatric patients at risk of deteriorating outside of the ICU setting.","Gorham, Tyler J.; Rust, Steve; Rust, Laura; Kuehn, Stacy; Yang, Jing; Lin, James Shuhan; Hoffman, Jeffrey; Huang, Yungui; Lin, Simon; McClead, Richard; Brilli, Richard; Bode, Ryan; Maa, Tensing",Pediatr Qual Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7190256/,359

13078,Commentary: Telemedicine: The unsung corona warrior,2020-06-11,"The complexity of current nucleic acid isolation methods limits their use outside of the modern laboratory environment. Here, we describe a fast and affordable method to purify nucleic acids from animal, plant, viral and microbial samples using a cellulose-based dipstick. Nucleic acids can be purified by dipping in-house-made dipsticks into just three solutions: the extract (to bind the nucleic acids), a wash buffer (to remove impurities) and the amplification reaction (to elute the nucleic acids). The speed and simplicity of this method make it ideally suited for molecular applications, both within and outside the laboratory, including limited-resource settings such as remote field sites and teaching institutions. Detailed instructions for how to easily manufacture large numbers of dipsticks in house are provided. Using the instructions, readers can create more than 200 dipsticks in <30 min and perform dipstick-based nucleic acid purifications in 30 s.","Mason, Michael G.; Botella, José R.",Nat Protoc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7528719/,359
13656,Trends in licence approvals for ophthalmic medicines in the United Kingdom,2020-01-03,"BACKGROUND: The Royal College of Physicians (RCP) and Thyroid Eye Disease Amsterdam Declaration Implementation Group (TEAMeD-5) have the common goal of improving access to high quality care for thyroid eye disease (TED). The TEAMeD-5 programme recommends all patients with moderate-to-severe TED should have access to multidisciplinary clinics (MDT) with combined Ophthalmology and Endocrinology expertise. METHODS: The British Oculoplastic Surgery Society represents oculoplastic surgeons who usually lead TED care in the UK. A two-stage survey of the membership was conducted to ascertain current practice of existing resources. RESULTS: Seventy percent (45/65) of respondents in Survey 1 were aware of current RCP guidance, but only 49% (22/45) rated it as a good means of improving access to comprehensive TED service. Sixty percent (39/65) of respondents are working in a multidisciplinary TED clinic with co-location of ophthalmologists and endocrinologists. Care for TED appears not to be provided in a multidisciplinary context in up to 31% (20/65). Thirty five (54%) of the respondents rated their relationship with endocrinology colleagues as good. Best practice guidelines recommend routine quality of life assessments but only 6/28 (21%) of respondents use this modality in current practice. Six percent (4/65) of areas appear not to be using intravenous steroids. In many areas (25%, 16/65), second-line immunosuppression is provided in a different trust and in 8% (5/65), it appears not to be used at all. CONCLUSION: This survey is a ‘snapshot’ of current TED management in the UK and findings suggest scope for improvement. We recommend a framework for more robust collaboration across specialties and propose standards endorsed by multidisciplinary stakeholder societies.","Lee, Vickie; Avari, Parizad; Williams, Ben; Perros, Petros; Dayan, Colin",Eye (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7608203/,359
14565,Disruption of Nrxn1α within excitatory forebrain circuits drives value-based dysfunction,2020-12-04,"Malaria occurrence in the Chittagong Hill Tracts in Bangladesh varies by season and year, but this pattern is not well characterized. The role of environmental conditions on the occurrence of this vector-borne parasitic disease in the region is not fully understood. We extracted information on malaria patients recorded in the Upazila (sub-district) Health Complex patient registers of Rajasthali in Rangamati district of Bangladesh from February 2000 to November 2009. Weather data for the study area and period were obtained from the Bangladesh Meteorological Department. Non-linear and delayed effects of meteorological drivers, including temperature, relative humidity, and rainfall on the incidence of malaria, were investigated. We observed significant positive association between temperature and rainfall and malaria occurrence, revealing two peaks at 19 °C (logarithms of relative risks (logRR) = 4.3, 95% CI: 1.1–7.5) and 24.5 °C (logRR = 4.7, 95% CI: 1.8–7.6) for temperature and at 86 mm (logRR = 19.5, 95% CI: 11.7–27.3) and 284 mm (logRR = 17.6, 95% CI: 9.9–25.2) for rainfall. In sub-group analysis, women were at a much higher risk of developing malaria at increased temperatures. People over 50 years and children under 15 years were more susceptible to malaria at increased rainfall. The observed associations have policy implications. Further research is needed to expand these findings and direct resources to the vulnerable populations for malaria prevention and control in the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh and the region with similar settings.","Emeto, Theophilus I.; Adegboye, Oyelola A.; Rumi, Reza A.; Khan, Mahboob-Ul I.; Adegboye, Majeed; Khan, Wasif A.; Rahman, Mahmudur; Streatfield, Peter K.; Rahman, Kazi M.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7766360/,359

A hallmark of herpesviruses is their biphasic life cycle consisting of latent and lytic infection. In this study, we identified that cellular nonsense-mediated decay (NMD), an evolutionarily conserved RNA degradation pathway, critically regulates the latent-to-lytic switch of EBV and KSHV infection. The NMD machinery suppresses EBV and KSHV Rta transactivator expression and promotes maintenance of viral latency by targeting the viral polycistronic transactivator transcripts for degradation through the recognition of features in their 3′ UTRs. Treatment with a small-molecule NMD inhibitor potently induced reactivation in a variety of EBV- and KSHV-infected cell types. In conclusion, our results identify NMD as an important host process that controls oncogenic herpesvirus reactivation, which may be targeted for the therapeutic induction of lytic reactivation and the eradication of tumor cells.","van Gent, Michiel; Reich, Adrian; Velu, Sadanandan E.; Gack, Michaela U.",PLoS Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7888593/,359

20239,Commentary: Nearwork-induced transient myopia – Is this the game changer?,2021-07-11,"Metal-catalyzed reactions play a vital part to construct a variety of pharmaceutically important scaffolds from past few decades. To carry out these reactions under mild conditions with low-cost easily available precursors, various new methodologies have been reported day by day. Sandmeyer reaction is one of these, first discovered by Sandmeyer in 1884. It is a well-known reaction mainly used for the conversion of an aryl amine to an aryl halide in the presence of Cu(I) halide via formation of diazonium salt intermediate. This reaction can be processed with or without copper catalysts for the formation of C–X (X = Cl, Br, I, etc.), C-CF(3)/CF(2), C–CN, C–S, etc., linkages. As a result, corresponding aryl halides, trifluoromethylated compounds, aryl nitriles and aryl thioethers can be obtained which are effectively used for the construction of biologically active compounds. This review article discloses various literature reports about Sandmeyer-related transformations developed during 2000–2021 which give different ideas to synthetic chemists about further development of new and efficient protocols for Sandmeyer reaction. An updated compilation of new approaches for Sandmeyer reaction is described in this review to construct a variety of carbon-halogen, carbon-phosphorous, carbon-sulfur, carbon-boron etc. linkages.

For this purpose, platelets have a complex set of receptors allowing the recognition, binding, and manipulation of extracellular structures and the detection of pathogens and tissue damage. Intracellular vesicles contain a huge set of mediators that can be released to the extracellular space to coordinate the action of platelets as other cell types for tissue repair. Therapeutically, the most frequent use of platelets is the intravenous application of platelet concentrates in case of thrombocytopenia or thrombocytopathy. However, there is increasing evidence that the local application of platelet-rich concentrates and platelet-rich fibrin can improve wound healing and tissue repair in various settings in medicine and dentistry. For the therapeutic use of platelets in wound healing, several preparations are available in clinical practice.

21126,The Importance of Shared Decision-Making for Patients with Glioblastoma,2021-09-10,"Escherichia coli infections can result in lung injury, which may be closely linked to the induction of interferon secretion. The Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway is one of most important pathways that regulate interferon production. Thus, the present study aimed to dissect whether E. coli infections can regulate interferon production and the underlying mechanisms. For this aim, two lung cell lines, a human bronchial epithelial cell line transformed with Ad12-SV40 2B (BEAS-2b) and a human fetal lung fibroblast (HFL1) cell line, were used. The effects of E. coli infections on interferon production were studied using qRT-PCR, Western blot, and siRNA knockdown assays. E. coli infections remarkably promoted the expression levels of IFN-α, IFN-β, and ISGs. Major components of the JAK/STAT pathway, including JAK1, STAT1, and STAT2, were demonstrated to be regulated by E. coli infections. Importantly, knockdown of JAK1, STAT1, and STAT2 abolished the induction of IFN-α, IFN-β, and ISGs by E. coli. Therefore, experiments in the present study demonstrated that E. coli infections remarkably promoted interferon production in lung cells, which was closely regulated by the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. The findings in the present study are useful for further understanding the pathogenesis of E. coli infections in the lung and finding novel therapies to treat E. coli-induced lung injury.","Jin, Yan; Jia, Ziyi; Cai, Quan; Sun, Yanfei; Liu, Zhi",Amino Acids,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8441250/,359
22156,COVID-19 Testing and a Path out of the Pandemic,2021-10-06,"Ebola virus (EBOV) belongs to the Filoviridae family and causes severe illnesses such as hemorrhagic fever with a high mortality rate up to 90%. Now two antibody drugs termed Inmazeb and Ebanga have been approved for treating EBOV infection. However, clinical studies have demonstrated that the mortality rate of the patients who received these two antibody drugs remains above 30%. Therefore, novel therapeutics with better efficacy is still desired. The isolated human IgG1 constant domain 2 (CH2 domain) has been proposed as a scaffold for the development of C-based single domain antibodies (C-sdAbs) as therapeutic candidates against viral infections and other diseases. Here, we screened and identified a novel C-sdAb termed M24 that targets EBOV glycoprotein (GP) from a C-sdAb phage display library. M24 neutralizes the pseudotype EBOV with IC(50) of 0.8 nmol/L (12 ng/mL) and has modest neutralizing activity against authentic EBOV. Epitope determination, including molecular docking and site mutation analysis, discloses that M24 binds to the internal fusion loop (IFL) within GP2, a transmembrane subunit of GP. Interestingly, we found that the binding of M24 to GP at pH 5.5 has dramatically decreased compared to the binding at pH 7.5, which may lead to weak efficacy in the neutralization of authentic EBOV. Since no sdAb against EBOV infection has been reported to date, our results not only give a proof of concept that sdAbs could be utilized for the development of potential therapeutic candidates against EBOV infection, but also provide useful information for the discovery and improvement of anti-EBOV agents.","Wang, Rui; Zhang, Haiwei; Peng, Cheng; Shi, Jian; Zhang, Huajun; Gong, Rui",Virol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8502631/,359

35370,Striking a balance between principle and pragmatism in COVID-19-related enforcement in Hong Kong,2020-06-09,"BACKGROUND: Reverse genetics is used in many laboratories around the world and enables the creation of tailor-made influenza viruses with a desired genotype or phenotype. However, the process is not flawless, and difficulties remain during cloning of influenza gene segments into reverse genetics vectors (pHW2000, pHH21, pCAGGS). Reverse genetics begins with making cDNA copies of influenza gene segments and cloning them into bi-directional (pHW2000) or uni-directional plasmids (pHH21, pCAGGS) followed by transfection of the recombinant plasmid(s) to HEK-293 T or any other suitable cells which are permissive to transfection. However, the presence of internal restriction sites in the gene segments of many field isolates of avian influenza viruses makes the cloning process difficult, if employing conventional methods. Further, the genetic instability of influenza gene-containing plasmids in bacteria (especially Polymerase Basic 2 and Polymerase Basic 1 genes; PB2 and PB1) also leads to erroneous incorporation of bacterial genomic sequences into the influenza gene of interest. METHODS: Herein, we report an easy and efficient ligation and restriction enzyme independent (LREI) cloning method for cloning influenza gene segments into pHW2000 vector. The method involves amplification of megaprimers followed by PCR amplification of megaprimers using a bait plasmid, DpnI digestion and transformation. RESULTS: Hard-to-clone genes: PB2 of A/chicken/Bangladesh/23527/2014 (H9N2) and PB1 of A/chicken/Bangladesh/23527/2014 (H9N2), A/chicken/Jiangxi/02.05YGYXG023-P/2015 (H5N6) and A/Chicken/Vietnam/H7F-14-BN4–315/2014 (H9N2) were cloned into pHW2000 using our LREI method and recombinant viruses were subsequently rescued. CONCLUSION: The LREI cloning procedure represents an alternative strategy for cloning influenza gene segments which have internal restriction sites for the enzymes used in reverse genetics. Further, the problem of genetic instability in bacteria can be alleviated by growing recombinant bacterial cultures at a lower temperature. This technique can be applied to clone any influenza gene segment using universal primers, which would help in rapid generation of influenza viruses and facilitate influenza research and vaccine development.","Bhat, Sushant; Bialy, Dagmara; Sealy, Joshua E.; Sadeyen, Jean-Remy; Chang, Pengxiang; Iqbal, Munir",Virol J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7309217/,359

This came on the heels of the popular protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019, and the February 2020 violence in Delhi. The interview situates the present moment, tying together history, socio-legal assessments of sectarian violence, evaluation of legal reform, and the ethics of anti-hate activism. First, Mander draws from his extensive experience — as a former bureaucrat, anti-hate advocate, and legal activist — to offer the larger historical trajectory of sectarian violence in India. His account highlights the role of the rising majoritarian state ideology in facilitating and celebrating sectarian hostilities. He also develops an account of how we should understand the social and personal harms of mass violence and the phenomenon of lynching. Second, he discusses the contentious question of legal reform for ending impunity in hate crime cases. Specifically, he notes the problem of state complicity in violence and the failed attempts to legislate an anti-communal violence law. Third, he elaborates on the protracted challenges of building viable strategies of litigation in the aftermath of sectarian violence. He evaluates Nyayagraha (literally meaning struggle for justice), his unique experiment after the 2002 Gujarat pogrom based on an ethical practice for legal justice.","Bhat, M Mohsin Alam",Jindal Global Law Review,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7438403/,359

Motivated by case studies provided by our industry partner, we study a relational extension of dL, aiming to formally prove statements such as “an earlier engagement of the emergency brake yields a smaller collision speed.” A main technical challenge is to combine two dynamics, so that the powerful inference rules of dL (such as the differential invariant rules) can be applied to such relational reasoning, yet in such a way that we relate two different time points. Our contributions are a semantical theory of time stretching, and the resulting synchronization rule that expresses time stretching by the syntactic operation of Lie derivative. We implemented this rule as an extension of KeYmaera X, by which we successfully verified relational properties of a few models taken from the automotive domain.","Kolčák, Juraj; Dubut, Jérémy; Hasuo, Ichiro; Katsumata, Shin-ya; Sprunger, David; Yamada, Akihisa",Tools and Algorithms for the Construction and Analysis of Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7439732/,359
39767,Editor's Choices,2020-09-23,"BACKGROUND: From early 2009, the Dutch region of South Limburg experienced a massive outbreak of Q fever, overlapping with the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic during the second half of the year and affecting approximately 2.9% of a 300,000 population. Acute Q fever shares clinical features with other respiratory conditions. Most symptomatic acute infections are characterized by mild symptoms, or an isolated febrile syndrome. Pneumonia was present in a majority of hospitalized patients during the Dutch 2007–2010 Q fever epidemic. Early empiric doxycycline, guided by signs and symptoms and patient history, should not be delayed awaiting laboratory confirmation, as it may shorten disease and prevent progression to focalized persistent Q fever. We assessed signs’ and symptoms’ association with acute Q fever to guide early empiric treatment in primary care patients. METHODS: In response to the outbreak, regional primary care physicians and hospital-based medical specialists tested a total of 1218 subjects for Q fever. Testing activity was bimodal, a first “wave” lasting from March to December 2009, followed by a second “wave” which lasted into 2010 and coincided with peak pandemic influenza activity. We approached all 253 notified acute Q fever cases and a random sample of 457 Q fever negative individuals for signs and symptoms of disease. Using data from 140/229(61.1%) Q fever positive and 194/391(49.6%) Q fever negative respondents from wave 1, we built symptom-based models predictive of Q-fever outcome, validated against subsets of data from wave 1 and wave 2. RESULTS: Our models had poor to moderate AUC scores (0.68 to 0.72%), with low positive (4.6–8.3%), but high negative predictive values (91.7–99.5%). Male sex, fever, and pneumonia were strong positive predictors, while cough was a strong negative predictor of acute Q fever in these models. CONCLUSION: Whereas signs and symptoms of disease do not appear to predict acute Q fever, they may help rule it out in favour of other respiratory conditions, prompting a delayed or non-prescribing approach instead of early empiric doxycycline in primary care patients with non-severe presentations. Signs and symptoms thus may help reduce the overuse of antibiotics in primary care during and following outbreaks of Q fever.","Hackert, Volker H.; Dukers-Muijrers, Nicole H. T.

40039,COVID-19: A 2020 update,2020-08-21,"Background: Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) is a neurological autoimmune disease that can lead to respiratory failure and death. Whether COVID-19 patients are at high risk of GBS is unknown. Through a systematic review of case reports, we aimed to summarize the main features of patients with GBS and COVID-19. Methods: Without any restrictions, we searched MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, Scopus, Web of Science and MedXriv (April 23 rd, 2020). Two reviewers screened and studied titles, abstracts and reports. We extracted information to characterize sociodemographic variables, clinical presentation, laboratory results, treatments and outcomes. Results: Eight reports (n=12 patients) of GBS and COVID-19 were identified; one was a Miller Fisher case. The age ranged between 23 and 77 years, and there were more men (9/102). GBS symptoms started between 5 and 24 days after those of COVID-19. The protein levels in cerebrospinal fluid samples ranged between 40 and 193 mg/dl. None of the cerebrospinal fluid samples tested positive for COVID-19. Six patients debuted with ascendant weakness and three with facial weakness. Five patients had favourable evolution, four remained with relevant symptoms or required critical care and one died; the Miller Fisher case had successful resolution. Conclusions: GBS is emerging as a disease that may appear in COVID-19 patients. Although limited, preliminary evidence appears to suggest that GBS occurs after COVID-19 onset. Practitioners and investigators should have GBS in mind as they look after COVID-19 patients and conduct research on novel aspects of COVID-19. Comparison with GBS patients in the context of another viral outbreak (Zika), revealed similarities and differences that deserves further scrutiny and epidemiological studies.","Carrillo-Larco, Rodrigo M.; Altez-Fernandez, Carlos; Ravaglia, Sabrina; Vizcarra, Joaquín A.",Wellcome Open Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7509591/,359

Azodicarbonamide (ADA), a compound used in the baking and plastics industries, has been reported to cause pulmonary sensiti-zation and dermatitis in people. Two-week repeated and 13-week subchronic inhalation exposures of F344/N rats and B6C3F, mice to ADA were conducted to determine the toxicity of inhaled ADA. The mean air concentrations of ADA in the 2-week studies were 207, 102, 52, 9.4, or 2.0 mg/m3. No exposure-related mortality nor abnormal clinical signs were observed in rats or mice during or after exposure. The terminal body weights were slightly depressed in the highest exposure group. Liver weights were lower in male rats exposed to 200 mg ADA/m3. No significant lesions were noted on either gross or histologic evaluation of rats or mice. In the 13-week subchronic study, the mean air concentrations of ADA were 204, 100, or 50 mg/m3. No mortality or clinical signs related to exposure were observed. The terminal body weights of exposed rats were not significantly different from those of control rats but were significantly depressed in mice exposed to 100 or 200 mg ADA/m3. No histopathological lesions were noted in mice. Lung weights were increased and enlarged mediastinal and/or tracheobronchial lymph nodes were noted in rats exposed to 50 mg ADA/m3. No exposure-related lesions were observed microscopically in rats exposed to 100 or 200 mg ADA/m3. All rats in the 50 mg ADA/m3 exposure group only had lung lesions that consisted of perivascular cuffing with lymphocytes and a multifocal type II cell hyperplasia, suggesting a possible immune reaction to an antigen in the lung. Viral titers for rats exposed to 50 mg ADA/m3 were negative for Sendai virus and pneumonia virus of mice, which produce similar lesions. The possibility of an unknown viral antigen causing this lesion cannot be eliminated. Lung tissue from male rats was analyzed for ADA and biurea, the major metabolite of ADA. No ADA was detected. The amount of biurea in the lungs increased nonlinearly with increasing exposure concentration, suggesting that clearance was somewhat impaired with repeated exposures. However, even at the highest exposure concentration, this amount of biurea was less than 1 % of the estimated total ADA deposited over the exposure period. In summary, ADA is rapidly cleared from the lungs, even when inhaled at concentrations up to 200 mg/m3. Exposure to ADA for up to 13 weeks did not appear to be toxic to rodents","MEDINSKY, M.

Efficient, eco-friendly, and cost-effective methods of disinfection for pathogens are vital to the health of human beings. The photocatalysis route has attracted worldwide attention due to its highly efficient oxidative capabilities and sustainable recycling, which can be used to realize the disinfection purposes without secondary pollution. Though many studies have comprehensively reviewed the work about photocatalytic disinfection, including design and fabrication of photocatalytic coatings, inactivation mechanisms, or practical applications, systematic reviews about the disinfection photocatalysis coatings from fabrication to effort for practical use are still rare. Among different ways of fabricating photocatalytic materials, thermal spray is a versatile surface coating technique and competitive in constructing large-scale functional coatings, which is a most promising way for the future environmental purification, biomedical and life health applications. In this review, we briefly introduced various photocatalytic materials and corresponding inactivation mechanisms for virus, bacteria and fungus. We summarized the thermal-sprayed photocatalysts and their antimicrobial performances. Finally, we discussed the future perspectives of the photocatalytic disinfection coatings for potential applications. This review would shed light on the development and implementation of sustainable disinfection strategies that is applicable for extensive use for controlling pathogens in the near future.","Liu, Yi; Huang, Jing; Feng, Xiaohua; Li, Hua",J Therm Spray Tech,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7640575/,359

Against this backdrop, the article identifies the SDRM interests of key players, including the European Commission, the European Parliament, the European Central Bank and national governments. The empirical section takes advantage of the recently established EMU Positions Database. The findings confirm political economy expectations: Low-debt countries support an EMU constitution that includes an insolvency procedure whereas a coalition of high-debt countries and European institutions oppose it. The analysis points towards a possible political-economic equilibrium for coping with sovereign insolvencies: an institutional set-up without an SDRM and with hidden transfers.

In the current work, a copolymer of phenylene and thiophene is designed, where the phenylene ring lowers the highest occupied molecular orbital level of the polymer of visible‐light‐harvesting thiophene entities and works as a robust catalytic site for the O(2) reduction to H(2)O(2) production. The very high onset potential of the copolymer for O(2) reduction (+1.53 V vs RHE, pH 12) allows a H(2)O(2) production setup with a traditional water‐oxidation catalyst, manganese oxide (MnO(x)), as the anode. MnO(x) is deposited on one face of a conducting plate, and visible‐light illumination of the copolymer layer formed on the other face aids steady O(2) reduction to H(2)O(2) with no bias assistance and a complete photocatalytic conversion rate of 14 000 mg (H(2)O(2)) g(photocat) (−1) h(−1) or ≈0.2 mg (H(2)O(2)) cm(−2) h(−1).","Oka, Kouki; Nishide, Hiroyuki; Winther‐Jensen, Bjorn",Adv Sci (Weinh),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7927612/,359

The digitalization also affects the size and complexity of the infrastructure and therefore makes it more difficult to gain an overview in order to secure the entire power system from attackers. One method of how to gain an overview of possible vulnerabilities and security threats is to use threat modeling. In threat modeling, information regarding the vulnerabilities and possible attacks of power systems is required to create an accurate and useful model. There are several different sources for this information. In this paper we conduct a systematic literature review to find which information sources that have been used in power system threat modeling research.

In this framework, counteracting actions at the urban scale, such as regeneration programmes, need to be targeted primarily at areas of significant risk, occurring with a combination of vulnerability factors, in three dimensions: social, building and urban. Furthermore, in order to be effective, such programmes must be geared to maximizing risk mitigation. This is possible when the planning of interventions takes into account the evaluation results of the better design alternative in order to reduce pre-existing vulnerability. Such an approach constitutes the novelty of the study. So, the aim of the work is to provide an innovative model for the mitigation of peripheralization risk at urban scale.

50895,96 Impact of COVID19 Restrictions on Older Patients Attending An Outpatient Service,2021-03-16,"The consumption of phenol-rich foods is limited by their prominent bitterness and astringency. This issue has been addressed by adding sweet tastes, which suppress bitterness, but this is not a complete solution since individuals also differ in their preference for sweetness. In this study, we aimed at identifying groups of consumers differing in sweetness optima and sensory-liking patterns. To this end, increasing concentrations of sucrose were added to a chocolate pudding base. This allowed us to (1) investigate if individual differences in sensory responses are associated with different sweet liking optima in a product context, (2) define the psychological and oro-sensory profile of sweet liker phenotypes derived using a product context, and (3) assess if individuals differing in sweet liking optima differ also in consumption and liking of phenol-rich foods and beverages as a function of their sensory properties (e.g., sweeter vs. more bitter and astringent products). Individuals (1208; 58.4% women, 18–69 years) were characterised for demographics, responsiveness to 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP), personality traits and attitudes toward foods. Three clusters were identified based on correlations between sensory responses (sweetness, bitterness and astringency) and liking of the samples: liking was positively related to sweetness and negatively to bitterness and astringency in High and Moderate Sweet Likers, and the opposite in Inverted U-Shaped. Differences between clusters were found in age, gender and personality. Furthermore, the Inverted-U Shaped cluster was found to have overall healthier food behaviours and preferences, with higher liking and consumption of phenol-rich vegetables and beverages without added sugar. These findings point out the importance of identifying the individual sensory-liking patterns in order to develop more effective strategies to promote the acceptability of healthy phenol-rich foods.","Spinelli, Sara; Prescott, John; Pierguidi, Lapo; Dinnella, Caterina; Arena, Elena; Braghieri, Ada; Di Monaco, Rossella; Gallina Toschi, Tullia; Endrizzi, Isabella; Proserpio, Cristina; Torri, Luisa; Monteleone, Erminio",Nutrients,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7998421/,359

Sooner or later the limitations to their mobility enforce them to bed and to more frequent hospitalizations. We include among these patients at risk those who are negative for the SARS-COV-2 infection, but suffering with COVID-19 pandemic syndrome. Beside managements of psychological symptoms, it is mandatory to offer to the last group physical rehabilitation approaches easy to learn and self-managed at home. Inspired by the proven capability to recover skeletal muscle contractility and strength by home-based volitional exercises and functional electrical stimulation, we suggest also for chronic COVID-19 pandemic syndrome a 10–20 min long daily routine of easy and safe physical exercises that can activate, and recover from weakness, the main 400 skeletal muscles used for every-day mobility activities. Persons can do many of them in bed (Full-Body in-Bed Gym), and hospitalized patients can learn this light training before leaving the hospital. It is, indeed, an extension of well-established cardiovascular-respiratory rehabilitation training performed after heavy surgical interventions. Blood pressure readings, monitored before and after daily routine, demonstrate a transient decrease in peripheral resistance due to increased blood flow of many muscles.

52400,Using Technology to Treat a Diabetic Emergency at Home in the Time of COVID19 Pandemic,2021-05-03,"INTRODUCTION: Frailty is a heightened state of vulnerability due to an accumulation of age-related defects in separate physiological systems (1). Frailty is becoming increasingly common, with up to 50% of older adults being diagnosed with mild, moderate or severe frailty (35%, 12% and 3% respectively) (2). Community pharmacists may often be the primary healthcare professional with whom frail older people have most frequent contact due to their convenience and accessibility. Therefore, it is hypothesised that community pharmacists could play a wider role in frailty identification and medicines optimisation for frail older people. AIM: To explore community pharmacists’ knowledge of frailty and its assessment, their experiences and contact with frail older patients in the community pharmacy setting, and their perceptions of their role in optimising medicines for frail older people. METHODS: Two strategies were used to recruit community pharmacists registered in Northern Ireland (NI). Community pharmacists were recruited through the Pharmacy Forum NI bi-monthly newsletter and the School of Pharmacy Undergraduate Placement Network, followed by snowballing. The interview topic guide was developed based on the published literature, current frailty guidelines and through discussion within the research team; it was piloted with four pharmacists. Semi-structured interviews commenced in March 2020. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, face-to-face interviews were logistically not possible, therefore telephone interviews were conducted at a time convenient to participants. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using inductive thematic analysis. RESULTS: To date, 14 interviews have been conducted, lasting between 24 and 72 minutes. Apart from one interview, all were conducted over the telephone. Participant characteristics are summarised in Table 1. Analysis of interview transcripts is ongoing. Findings to date have highlighted the key role community pharmacists feel they play in assisting frail older patients with their medicines (especially during the current pandemic). Many saw themselves as a ‘point of contact’ for frail older people and highlighted the holistic approaches they used to care of such patients: “It’s easier to get in contact with us than other healthcare professionals and we tend to be the first port of call really” [CP2]. Interviews highlighted a lack of pharmacist knowledge surrounding frailty as a condition and its assessment, with participants primarily focusing on the physical aspects of frailty (e.g. weight loss, weakness) when observing or ‘informally assessing’ patients. None of the participants reported formally assessing their patients using validated frailty tools or checklists: “It’s not something that I’ve ever thought about. We don’t have any tools readily available to us that I know of and certainly nothing that would be standardised” [CP1]. CONCLUSION: This study has highlighted that community pharmacists felt they could contribute to optimising medicines for frail older people. However, the findings emphasise the need for more formal training for community pharmacists about the clinical aspects of frailty, frailty assessment and future interventions to address the medicines-related issues they have encountered with this patient population.

Objectives: This study aimed to measure the effect of children’s emotional ability on resilience and to provide an in-depth analysis based on age and gender differences. Methodology: A total of 300 preschool children aged 3–6 years old in kindergartens of China were randomly selected as the research subjects. Through a combination of experiments and questionnaires, the emotional ability and resilience of children were measured, and differences were analyzed according to the actual situation, using age and gender. Results: Children of different ages have significant differences in the dimensions and total scores of emotional ability and resilience, but only some of the resilience dimensions have significant gender differences. Moreover, the emotional ability has a significant positive effect on resilience. Discussions: The results confirm the influence of children’s emotional ability on resilience, but the research hypothesis has not been fully verified.

However, there are not enough studies on middle-aged residents in Japan or other Eastern countries to currently achieve this. Thus, the aim of this study was to comprehensively identify factors related to depression in middle-aged residents in Japan, an Eastern country. The study design was cross-sectional. A questionnaire survey was conducted among all community residents aged 40 to 59 in a rural municipality in Western Japan. The questionnaire contained items on demographic characteristics, psychological factors, health-related behaviors, and socioeconomic factors. A Chi-Squared test or Fisher exact test was used to analyze the relationships between depression and each assessed factor. Next, a logistic regression analysis was performed to identify comprehensive relationships between depression and its related factors. Data from 362 participants were analyzed. The average age was 51.5 years; 148 were male. A Chi-Squared test or Fisher exact test demonstrated that many psychological factors, health-related behaviors, and socioeconomic factors ware significantly related to depression. A logistic regression analysis showed that depression was significantly associated with male gender, low sense of coherence, high cognitive stress levels, low help-seeking behavior, poor quality sleep, and a lack of hobbies. Nagelkerke R(2) was 51%. This study revealed through multivariate analysis that depression was primarily associated with personal behavioral and psychological factors in Japan, an Eastern country with a holistic cultural background. This result is consistent with findings from Western countries. This study can contribute the promotion and evaluation of preventive measures for depression in Eastern culture that focus on individual behavioral and psychological factors.","Fukita, Susumu; Kawasaki, Hiromi; Yamasaki, Satoko",Medicine (Baltimore),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8133093/,359
53232,62 Is Weight Loss Alone an Appropriate Indication for Urgent Gastroscopy?,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims In March 2020, the WHO characterised COVID-19 as a pandemic. Whilst many people with COVID-19 infection appeared to have mild or no symptoms, a significant proportion became seriously ill. At the time, little was known about how patients with rheumatic or autoimmune conditions, many of whom use immunosuppressive medications, are affected by the virus. The aim of the patient-led longitudinal survey (the COVID-19 European Patient Registry, EPR) is to better understand the impact of COVID-19 on these patients. This specific analysis aims to understand how the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases affects the self-reported level of worry experienced by participants. Methods The EPR comprises an online health questionnaire. Each week participants are sent a short follow-up survey concerning exposure to COVID-19, symptoms, diagnosis, how worried they feel (scale, 0-10), and a range of behaviours. The weekly mean worry score from participants was calculated by country, and compared to the weekly total number of cases of COVID-19 reported within each country. The association between worry score and a range of behaviours was also calculated. Results To 27 September 2020, a total of 3,619 adults and 639 children were included in the EPR. There is a correlation between the total number of weekly cases and the mean worry score amongst UK-based adult participants in the EPR (linear regression, R(2)=0.779,P<0.001). Interestingly, there is no such correlation in any other country with participants in the EPR, nor amongst parents of children with rheumatic conditions. Additionally, the level of worry is associated with specific behaviours that affect exposure to the coronavirus for all adult participants. Conclusion The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 is associated with the level of worry, and consequent behaviour change, amongst UK adults with rheumatic conditions. This suggests that the number of cases, government response, and media portrayal affect how worried participants feel. This in turn drives behavioural change towards COVID-avoiding behaviours. This phenomenon appears exclusive to UK-based adults, suggesting differences in the perception of the threat posed by COVID varies between countries. Disclosure R.P. Beesley: None. W. Costello: None.

53249,509 Nasal SCC in a Young Caucasian Male,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims Anti-synthetase syndrome is an idiopathic inflammatory muscle disease, characterised by anti-Jo1 antibodies. Clinical presentation varies between individuals. The diagnosis requires the detection of one or more anti-synthetase antibodies and one or more of the following clinical features: interstitial lung disease, myositis, and inflammatory polyarthritis. Other supporting features include fever, Raynaud’s phenomenon, and 'mechanic’s hands'. The severity and extent of pulmonary involvement typically determines prognosis. It is a rare disease, with estimated prevalence of 1.5 cases per 100,000. Our aim is to report an increase in the local prevalence, which coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods We retrospectively reviewed all new diagnoses of anti-synthetase syndrome made between March and July 2020 at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital. Results 3 new diagnoses of anti-synthetase syndrome were made during the study period. Based on the reported prevalence, we expect to see around 2 cases every 6-months in our hospital (which serves a population of around 300,000.) Anecdotally, the incidence has been much lower than this previously, and in the experience of three rheumatology consultants working at this hospital, only 6 diagnoses have been made over the last 15 years. This represents a 15-fold increase in the annual diagnosis rate. This anecdotal rise in the number of patients with anti-synthetase syndrome coincides with the COVID-19 pandemic. The incidence of COVID-19 in our health-board during this time period was 666 per 100,000. This is higher than the national incidence (486 per 100,000.) All three patients diagnosed with anti-synthetase syndrome had prominent symptoms of shortness of breath, hypoxia and presented on multiple occasions before the final diagnosis was made. Notably, all patients presented acutely unwell with severe symptoms, where ordinarily this diagnosis would be made in the outpatient setting. One case presented with a typical constellation of signs and symptoms. Specifically, progressive shortness of breath with evidence of bilateral interstitial pulmonary disease on imaging, myositis and anti-Jo1 positivity. The remaining two cases presented with primarily lung involvement. In both cases, chest imaging demonstrated extensive bilateral lower lobe pulmonary infiltrates, reported as being in-keeping with COVID-19. Despite repeated negative COVID-19 PCR results, the clinical impression was of probable COVID-19 infection. Following repeated presentations with worsening respiratory symptoms, specialist review was arranged, and ultimately anti-synthetase syndrome was diagnosed. With hindsight, one patient demonstrated extrapulmonary features of Raynaud’s phenomenon and 'mechanic’s hands'. All cases received methylprednisolone and mycophenolate. Conclusion We report an anecdotal local increase in the incidence of anti-synthetase syndrome, coinciding with the COVID-19 pandemic. The cases described demonstrate an overlap between the presenting clinical features of COVID-19 and anti-synthetase syndrome, and that due to high clinical suspicion of COVID-19 in the context of a global pandemic, some diagnoses of anti-synthetase syndrome may be being missed or delayed.

53257,11 A Sequential Simulation Experience for Interim Foundation Doctors and Analysis of Preparedness to Practice Early,2021-05-04,"Background/Aims The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a number of changes in practice in the UK, including the reduction in routine day-case attendances for intravenous rheumatology treatments. Due to redeployment and resultant staff shortages, we required alternatives to day case attendance. The usual face-to-face education that normally supports this was not possible. Methods In March 2020, we identified patients receiving monthly intravenous tocilizumab on our day-unit and planned a supported transition to weekly subcutaneous self-injection. We designed, planned, storyboarded, video-recorded, and piloted a 15-minute tocilizumab self-injection interactive video resource, using evidence-based educational methodology. This included: an introduction; explanation of the change and context; a one-minute video of our nurse specialist self-administering a sample injection; a close-up injection video; local logistical information and contact details, and a voluntary anonymous web-based evaluation. The interactive resource was searchable and contained links to supporting information, including a link to manufacturer patient education material. The intervention received rapid institution and pharmacy approval for distribution. We sent it via SMS message to our cohort of patients using a commercial partner (HealthComm UK) from 8.4.20, using an established method we have recently described. Simultaneously, we made it publicly available on our departmental website. We collated feedback and usage metrics over an eight-week period (8.4.20 - 3.6.20). Results We identified 69 patients eligible to switch to self-injection; all were sent the SMS link. Our resource was viewed by 39/69 patients (57%) via the unique SMS link, a total of 97 times (mean 2.5 views/patient). Others watched it on our website, 534 views, by 283 unique visitors (1.9 views/visitor). In total, 24/69 patients (35%) returned a complete evaluation of the video, 16/24 (67%) felt more confident injecting after watching the resource. Age ranges in deciles (number) was: 40-49, (5); 50-59, (6); 60-69, (8); >70, (5). Likert scores for satisfaction with the resource (1=strongly disagree; 5=strongly agree) were as follows: video ease and playback (4.1); improved confidence of self-injection (4.0), usefulness of SMS methodology (4.3), usefulness of interactive resource over video (3.7). A number (9/24, 38%) had never self-injected any medicine. Most completing the evaluation (18/24, 75%) viewed the resource on mobile phones. Written feedback, where given, was positive in 18/19 (95%) cases, one patient identified they could not watch the video. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the use of telerheumatology resources. We have demonstrated that interactive video resources are a rapid, acceptable, and useful method of delivering rheumatology education. This intervention is low cost (£0.01 per SMS) and we used existing e-learning technology already licensed to our hospital at no additional cost to the department, other than staff time. Our findings have implications for other aspects of rheumatology self-care and we call for further research in this area. Disclosure P. Mistry: None. J. Bateman: None. K.

To better understand the needs of transgender and gender nonconforming young people accessing Foundry—this study compares rates of mental health distress between transgender and gender nonconforming young people and cisgender young people accessing services and examines the extent to which race may have amplified the association between transgender and gender nonconforming identity and mental health distress. We analyzed the difference using a two-sample t-test. We used stratified simple linear regression to test the association of race with transgender and gender nonconforming identity and mental health distress. Participants were recruited from a network of community health centers in British Columbia, Canada. The quantitative sample (n = 727) had a mean age of 21 years (SD = 2), 48% were non-white, 51% were white, and 77% were from Metro Vancouver. Compared to cisgender young people, transgender and gender nonconforming young people reported significantly higher levels of mental health distress. Transgender and gender nonconforming youth were more distressed than cisgender youth across both race strata but non-white transgender and gender nonconforming young people were not more distressed than white transgender and gender nonconforming young people. The findings from this study emphasize the need for increased education and understanding of transgender and gender nonconforming concepts and health concerns as well as on promoting intersectoral collaboration of social services organizations beyond simply health care.","Pattison, Rachal; Puyat, Joseph H.; Giesbrecht, Allison; Zenone, Marco; Mathias, Steve; Barbic, Skye",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8511444/,359

However, the potential bioaccumulation of microplastics by plants and their effects on plants' physiology remains unexplored. Here, we evaluated the adsorption, potential uptake, and physiological effects of polyethylene (PE) microbeads in an experimental hydroponic culture of maize. Using isotope analysis, taking advantage of the different carbon isotope composition (δ13C) of fossil-derived PE and C4 plants (e.g., maize), we estimated that about 30% of the carbon in the rhizosphere of microplastic-exposed plants was derived from PE. Still, we did not find evidence of PE translocation to the shoots. Plastic bioaccumulation in the rhizosphere caused a significant decline in transpiration, nitrogen content, and growth. Our results indicate that plastic particles may accumulate in the rhizosphere, impairing water and nutrient uptake, and eventually reaching root eaters. Due to the implications for food production and livestock feeding, our findings encourage further research on the mechanism leading to the bioaccumulation of microplastics on the surface of belowground tissues.","Urbina, Mauricio A; Correa, Francisco; Aburto, Felipe; Ferrio, Juan Pedro",The Science of the total environment,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.140216; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32886998/,359

61927,Cost-effectiveness of Hypertension Treatment by Pharmacists in Black Barbershops.,2021-04-15,"BACKGROUND Vascular endothelial activation is pivotal for the pathological development of various infectious and inflammatory diseases. Therapeutic interventions to prevent endothelial activation are of great clinical significance to achieve anti-inflammatory strategy. Previous studies indicate that the total flavonoids from the endemic herbal medicine Nervilia fordii (Hance) Schltr exerts potent anti-inflammatory effect and protective effect against endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury, and shows clinical benefit in severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS). However, the exact effective component of Nervilia fordii and its potential mechanism remain unknown. PURPOSE The aim of this study was to investigate the effect and mechanism of rhamnocitrin (RH), a flavonoid extracted from Nervilia fordii, on LPS-induced endothelial activation. METHODS The in vitro endothelial cell activation model was induced by LPS in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Cell viability was measured to determine the cytotoxicity of RH. RT-PCR, Western blot, fluorescent probe and immunofluorescence were conducted to evaluate the effect and mechanism of RH against endothelial activation. RESULTS RH was extracted and isolated from Nervilia fordii. RH at the concentration from 10-7 M-10-5 M inhibited the expressions of interlukin-6 (IL-6) and -8 (IL-8), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell-adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in response to LPS challenge. Mechanistically, RH repressed calcium store-operated Ca2+ entry (SOCE) induced by LPS, which is due to downregulation of stromal interaction molecule-1 (STIM-1) following upregulating microRNA-185 (miR-185). Ultimately, RH abrogated LPS-induced activation of SOCE-mediated calcineurin/NFATc3 (nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 3) signaling pathway. CONCLUSION The present study identifies RH as a potent inhibitor of endothelial activation. Since vascular endothelial activation is a pivotal cause of excessive cytokine production, leading to cytokine storm and severe pathology in infectious diseases such as SARS and the ongoing COVID-19 pneumonia disease, RH might suggest promising therapeutic potential in the management of cytokine storm in these diseases.","Lin, Tong; Luo, Wenwei; Li, Ziqing; Zhang, Lili; Zheng, Xinghan; Mai, Liting; Yang, Wanqi; Guan, Guimei; Su, Ziren; Liu, Peiqing; Li, Zhuoming; Xie, Youliang",Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2020.153350; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33002827/,359

To assess whether emergency general surgeons (EGS) could provide a 'Hot Gall Bladder Service' (HGS) with an acceptable outcome. Patients and Methods This was a prospective HGS observational study that was protocol driven with strict inclusion/exclusion criteria and secure online data collection in a district general hospital between July 2018 and June 2019. A weekly dedicated theatre slot was allocated for this list. Results Of the 143 referred for HGS, 86 (60%) underwent ELC which included 60 (70%) women. Age, ASA and body mass index was 54* (18-85) years, II* (I-III) and 27* (20-54), respectively. 86 included 46 (53%), 19 (22%), 19 (22%) and 2 (3%) patients presenting with acute calculus cholecystitis, gallstone pancreatitis, biliary colic, and acalculus cholecystitis, respectively. 85 (99%) underwent LC with a single conversion. Grade of surgical difficulty, duration of surgery and post-operative stay was 2* (1-4) 68* (30-240) min and 0* (0-13) day, respectively. Eight (9%) required senior surgical input with no intra-operative complications and 2 (2%) 30-day readmissions. One was post-operative subhepatic collection that recovered uneventfully and the second was pancreatitis, imaging was clear requiring no further intervention.

PATIENTS AND METHODS All groin hernia patients requiring TAPP repair were included in the study: Inguinal 142, Femoral 14, Spigelian 4, and Inguinal disruption 40. A retrospective review of the data was performed. There were 161 males and 39 females, mean age 55 years (range 20-89 years). Mesh fixation was successful in all 247 TAPP repairs, and 90% of patients had a successful peritoneal closure using the device (20 patients required the use of conventional tacks to complete closure). FOLLOW-UP Patients were followed up with an out-patient visit at 6 weeks post-op, followed by a Patient Initiated Follow Up programme, and a final Telephone follow-up. To date all patients have completed 1 year of follow-up, and 70% of patients 2 years of follow-up (median 29 months, range 14 to 40 months). RESULTS There were very few procedure-related adverse events: groin seromas 6 (2.4%), port site bleeding 2 (0.3%), port site hernia 2 (0.3%), and only 1 groin hernia recurrence (0.4%). Prospective surgeon scoring of satisfaction for mesh fixation, peritoneal closure, and device clogging was favourable and increased following the initial learning phase. Changes in the device design during the study period improved the efficacy of the device significantly.

There is no approved therapy in this indication. Reliable, reproducible lung deposition is a prerequisite for inhaled drugs. METHODS In this phase I study, six patients with NCFB, six with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and 12 healthy volunteers (HVs), received one dose of 99mTc-Ciprofloxacin DPI 32.5 mg to assess pulmonary drug deposition by quantitative scintigraphy. 81mKrypton ventilation scans were performed to map lung contours. Systemic exposure as mediated by absorption in the lung was measured using the charcoal block method. HVs ingested activated charcoal orally (20 g before and 2 × 10 g after inhalation) to block gastrointestinal absorption of drug swallowed during inhalation. Indirect determination of pulmonary drug deposition was based on plasma and urine pharmacokinetic (PK) data. RESULTS Scintigraphic data revealed high, reproducible lung deposition in all participants (intrapulmonary deposition relative to nominal dose, mean [standard deviation; range]: NCFB, 53% [11%; 38%-64%]; COPD, 51% [10%; 34%-61%]; HVs, 51% [7%; 40%-64%] to 53% [8%; 44%-70%]). Similar ratios of central-to-peripheral airway deposition were seen across groups. Systemic exposure to ciprofloxacin was low. Relative bioavailability of Ciprofloxacin DPI was reduced by ∼60% after charcoal block, suggesting that systemic exposure was mainly caused by uptake via the lung. Lung deposition of 30% was estimated from PK data, but this may be an underestimation due to drug clearance from the lung and transintestinal secretion.

METHODS Fifty-three patients with active disease from an ongoing prospective TAK cohort in China were included in this study. Twenty-seven patients were treated with glucocorticoids (GCs) and TOF, and 26 patients were treated with GCs with MTX. The observation period was 12 months. Complete remission (CR), inflammatory parameter changes, GCs tapering and safety were assessed at the 6th, 9th and 12th month. Vascular lesions were evaluated at the 6th and 12th month, and relapse was analysed during 12 months. RESULTS The CR rate was higher in the TOF group than in the MTX group (6 months: 85.19% vs 61.54%, p=0.07; 12 months: 88.46% vs 56.52%, p=0.02). During 12 months' treatment, patients in the TOF group achieved a relatively lower relapse rate (11.54% vs 34.78%, p=0.052) and a longer median relapse-free duration (11.65±0.98 vs 10.48±2.31 months, p=0.03). Average GCs dose at the 3rd, 6th and 12th month was lower in the TOF group than that in the MTX group (p<0.05). A difference was not observed in disease improvement or disease progression on imaging between the two groups (p>0.05). Prevalence of side effects was low in both groups (3.70% vs 15.38%, p=0.19). CONCLUSION TOF was superior to MTX for CR induction, a tendency to prevent relapse and tapering of the GCs dose in TAK treatment. A good safety profile for TOF was also documented in patients with TAK.","Kong, Xiufang; Sun, Ying; Dai, Xiaojuan; Wang, Li; Ji, Zongfei; Chen, Huiyong; Jin, Xuejuan; Ma, Lili; Jiang, Lindi",Annals of the rheumatic diseases,https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2021-220832; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34362744/,359
65394,Unveiling Long COVID-19 Disease.,2020-12-23,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic paraesophageal hernia repair (LPEHR) has been shown to be both safe and efficacious. Compulsory operative steps include reduction of the stomach from the mediastinum, resection of the mediastinal hernia sac, ensuring an appropriate intraabdominal esophageal length, and crural closure. The use of mesh materials in the repair of hiatal hernias remains controversial. Synthetic mesh may reduce hernia recurrences, but may increase postoperative dysphagia and result in esophageal erosion. Human acellular dermal matrix (HADM) may reduce the incidence of hernia recurrence with reduced complications compared with synthetic mesh. METHODS A retrospective review of all cases of laparoscopic hiatal hernia repair using HADM from December 2008 through March 2010 at a single institution was performed evaluating demographic information, BMI, operative times, length of stay, and complications. DISCUSSION Forty-six LPEHRs with HADM were identified. The mean age of patients was 60.3 years (± 13.9); BMI 30.3 (± 5.3); operative time 182 minutes (± 56); and length of stay 2.6 days (± 1.9). Nine of 46 (19.6%) patients experienced perioperative complications, including subcutaneous emphysema without pneumothorax (n=2), urinary retention (n=1), COPD exacerbation (n=2), early dysphagia resolving before discharge (n=1), esophageal perforation (n=1), delayed gastric perforation occurring 30 days postoperatively associated with gas bloat syndrome (n=1), and PEG site abscess (n=1). There were 2 clinically recurrent hernias (4.3%). Radiographic recurrences occurred in 2 of 26 patients (7.7%). Six of 46 (13%) patients reported persistent dysphagia. CONCLUSION LPEHR with HADM crural reinforcement is an effective method of repairing symptomatic paraesophageal hernias with low perioperative morbidity. Recurrences occur infrequently with this technique. No meshrelated complications were seen in this series.","Diaz, Dennis F; Roth, J Scott",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/108680811x13125733356594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21985724/,359
65784,Author's Response to Ferreira: Can Transdermal Photobiomodulation Help Us at the Time of COVID-19? An Update.,2020-06-01,"Ssr4 is a yeast protein from Schizosaccharomyces pombe and is an essential part of the chromatin-remodelling [SWI/SNF and RSC (remodelling the structure of chromatin)] complexes found in S. pombe. These complexes (or their homologues) regulate gene expression in eukaryotic organisms, affecting a large number of genes both positively and negatively. The downstream effects are seen in development, and in humans have implications for disease such as cancer. The chromatin structure is altered by modifying the DNA-histone contacts, thus opening up or closing down sections of DNA to specific transcription factors that regulate the transcription of genes. The Ssr4 sequence has little homology to other sequences in the Protein Data Bank, so the structure was solved using an iodine derivative with SAD phasing. The structure of the N-terminal domain is an antiparallel β-sheet of seven strands with α-helices on one side and random coil on the other. The structure is significantly different to deposited structures and was used as a target in the most recent Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP; https://predictioncenter.org/) competition.","Newman, Janet; Nebl, Tom; Van, Huy; Peat, Thomas S","Acta crystallographica.

To diminish the effect of this widespread pandemic, it is essential to detect COVID-19 cases as quickly as possible. Chest radiographs are less expensive and are a widely available imaging modality for detecting chest pathology compared with CT images. They play a vital role in early prediction and developing treatment plans for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 chest infection patients. In this paper, a novel shape-dependent Fibonacci-p patterns-based feature descriptor using a machine learning approach is proposed. Computer simulations show that the presented system (1) increases the effectiveness of differentiating COVID-19, viral pneumonia, and normal conditions, (2) is effective on small datasets, and (3) has faster inference time compared to deep learning methods with comparable performance. Computer simulations are performed on two publicly available datasets; (a) the Kaggle dataset, and (b) the COVIDGR dataset. To assess the performance of the presented system, various evaluation parameters, such as accuracy, recall, specificity, precision, and f1-score are used. Nearly 100% differentiation between normal and COVID-19 radiographs is observed for the three-class classification scheme using the cropped Kaggle radiographs.

66263,A Chinese version of the Patient Continuity of Care Questionnaire: reliability and validity assessment.,2017,"BACKGROUND Essential hypertension is an important risk factor for cerebrovascular diseases and a major cause of premature death in industrialized societies. A predisposing factor for essential hypertension is prehypertension: blood pressure (BP) values at rest that are at the higher end of the normal range. Abnormally enhanced cardiovascular responses to motor and emotional tasks have been found as predictors of essential hypertension. Yet, knowledge regarding the BP reaction to aversive stimuli and motor reaction in prehypertension is limited. METHODS We compared the reaction to aversive and neutral stimuli inducing an emotional response (experiment 1) and to the isometric handgrip exercise (IHE) inducing a motor response (experiment 2), between prehypertensive and normotensive controls. BP reactions were measured and analyzed in a continuous fashion, in contrast to previous studies that averaged BP responses across blocks. We applied a multilevel B-spline model, a continuous analysis that enabled a better understanding of the BP time course and the detection of subtle differences between groups. RESULTS In both tasks, we found that prehypertensive individuals showed enhanced DBP reactions compared with normotensive controls; prehypertensive individuals exhibited lower BP responses to aversive pictures and higher BP responses to the IHE. These results are in line with previous studies with healthy or hypertensive participants and suggest abnormalities already in the prehypertensive stage. CONCLUSION Considering the high frequency and health risks related to prehypertension, understanding the autonomic reactions to emotional and motor stimuli in this population is of clinical and theoretical importance and could serve as a behavioural marker to identify at-risk groups.","Wiener, Avigail; Goldstein, Pavel; Doenyas, Keren; Okon-Singer, Hadas",Journal of hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1097/hjh.0000000000002892; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973958/,359
66345,Initial Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Pediatric Asthma Emergency Department Utilization.,2020-06-06,"The Ebola virus (EBOV) genome encodes a partly conserved 40-residue nonstructural polypeptide, called the delta peptide, that is produced in abundance during Ebola virus disease (EVD). The function of the delta peptide is unknown, but sequence analysis has suggested that delta peptide could be a viroporin, belonging to a diverse family of membrane-permeabilizing small polypeptides involved in replication and pathogenesis of numerous viruses. Full-length and conserved C-terminal delta peptide fragments permeabilize the plasma membranes of nucleated cells of rodent, dog, monkey, and human origin; increase ion permeability across confluent cell monolayers; and permeabilize synthetic lipid bilayers. Permeabilization activity is completely dependent on the disulfide bond between the two conserved cysteines. The conserved C-terminal portion of the peptide is biochemically stable in human serum, and most serum-stable fragments have full activity. Taken together, the evidence strongly suggests that Ebola virus delta peptide is a viroporin and that it may be a novel, targetable aspect of Ebola virus disease pathology.IMPORTANCE During the unparalleled West African outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) that began in late 2013, the lack of effective countermeasures resulted in chains of serial infection and a high mortality rate among infected patients. A better understanding of disease pathology is desperately needed to develop better countermeasures. We show here that the Ebola virus delta peptide, a conserved nonstructural protein produced in large quantities by infected cells, has the characteristics of a viroporin. This information suggests a critical role for the delta peptide in Ebola virus disease pathology and as a possible target for novel countermeasures.","He, Jing; Melnik, Lilia I; Komin, Alexander; Wiedman, Gregory; Fuselier, Taylor; Morris, Cameron F; Starr, Charles G; Searson, Peter C; Gallaher, William R; Hristova, Kalina; Garry, Robert F; Wimley, William C",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00438-17; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28539454/,359

Kidney disease occurs when the kidneys are damaged and fail to function properly. Single-cell analysis is a powerful technology that provides unprecedented insights into normal and abnormal kidney cell types and will transform our understanding of the mechanism underlying common kidney diseases. Summary Our understanding of kidney disease pathogenesis is limited by the incomplete molecular characterization of cell types responsible for kidney functions. Application of single-cell technologies for the study of the kidney has revealed cellular heterogeneity, gene expression signatures, and molecular dynamics during the onset and development of kidney diseases. Single-cell analyses of kidney organoids and allograft tissues offer new insights into kidney organogenesis, disease mechanisms, and therapeutic outcomes. Collectively, a better understanding of kidney cell heterogeneity and the molecular dynamics of kidney diseases will improve diagnostic accuracy and facilitate the identification of novel treatment strategies in nephrology.

66999,Emerging treatments for COVID-19: déjà vu all over again?,2020-12-01,"INTRODUCTION In recent years, there has been increasing interest in the use of spirometry for the assessment of small airways obstruction (SAO) driven by the idea that these changes occur prior to development of established obstructive lung disease. Maximal mid-expiratory and distal flow rates have been widely used despite a lack of agreement regarding parameter selection or definition of an abnormal result. We aim to provide evidence from population-based studies, describing the different parameters, definitions of normal range and the resulting impact on prevalence estimates for SAO. Summarising this evidence is important to inform development of future studies in this area. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic review of population-based studies will be conducted. MEDLINE, Web of Science and Google Scholar will be searched from database inception to May 2021. Primary outcomes will include the spirometry parameter used to define SAO, and the definition of an abnormal result. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines will be followed for study selection. Study methods will be assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation working group methodology. Narrative synthesis will be conducted for all included studies. Meta-analysis will also be conducted for prevalence estimates and associated risk factors where data quality and availability allow. Random effects models will be used to conduct the meta-analysis and I2 statistics will be used to assess heterogeneity across studies.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 120 adult participants, with BMI 30.0-39.9 kg/m(2) and HbA1c ≥8.0%, were randomized 1:1 to two treatment arms at three clinical sites in the U.S. and one in Taiwan. All patients received the lifestyle-medical management intervention for 24 months; half were randomized to also receive gastric bypass. RESULTS At 36 months, the triple end point goal was met in 9% of lifestyle-medical management patients and 28% of gastric bypass patients (P = 0.01): 10% and 19% lower than at 12 months. Mean (SD) HbA1c values at 3 years were 8.6% (3.5) and 6.7% (2.0) (P < 0.001). No lifestyle-medical management patient had remission of diabetes at 36 months, whereas 17% of gastric bypass patients had full remission and 19% had partial remission. Lifestyle-medical management patients used more medications than gastric bypass patients: mean (SD) 3.8 (3.3) vs. 1.8 (2.4). Percent weight loss was mean (SD) 6.3% (16.1) in lifestyle-medical management vs. 21.0% (14.5) in gastric bypass (P < 0.001). Over 3 years, 24 serious or clinically significant adverse events were observed in lifestyle-medical management vs. 51 with gastric bypass. CONCLUSIONS Gastric bypass is more effective than lifestyle-medical management intervention in achieving diabetes treatment goals, mainly by improved glycemic control. However, the effect of surgery diminishes with time and is associated with more adverse events.","Ikramuddin, Sayeed; Korner, Judith; Lee, Wei-Jei; Bantle, John P; Thomas, Avis J; Connett, John E; Leslie, Daniel B; Inabnet, William B; Wang, Qi; Jeffery, Robert W; Chong, Keong; Chuang, Lee-Ming; Jensen, Michael D; Vella, Adrian; Ahmed, Leaque; Belani, Kumar; Olofson, Amy E; Bainbridge, Heather A; Billington, Charles J",Diabetes care,https://doi.org/10.2337/dc15-2481; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27311493/,359
67889,Asthma and COVID-19: What do we know?,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) places multiple instruments in close, parallel proximity, an orientation that may have implications in the production of stray current from the monopolar ""Bovie"" instrument. The purpose of this study was to compare the energy transferred during SILS compared to traditional four-port laparoscopic surgery (TRD). METHOD In a laparoscopic simulator, instruments were inserted via SILS or TRD setup. The monopolar generator delivered energy to a laparoscopic L-hook instrument for 5-s activations on 30-Watts coag mode. The primary outcome (stray current) was quantified by measuring the heat of liver tissue held adjacent to the non-electrically active 10-mm telescope tip and Maryland grasper in both the SILS and TRD setups. To control for the potential confounder of stray energy coupling via wires outside the surgical field, the camera cord and active electrode wires were oriented parallel or completely separated. RESULTS SILS and TRD setups create similar amounts of stray current as measured by increased tissue temperature at the non-electrically active telescope tip (41 ± 12 vs. 39 ± 10 °C; p = 0.71). Stray current was greater in SILS compared to TRD at the tip of the non-electrically active Maryland forceps (38 ± 9 vs. 20 ± 10 °C; p < 0.01). Separation of the active electrode and camera cords did not change the amount of stray energy in the SILS orientation for either telescope (39 ± 10 °C bundled vs. 36 ± 10 °C separated; p = 0.40) or grasper (38 ± 9 °C bundled vs. 34 ± 11 °C separated; p = 0.19) but did in the TRD orientation (41 ± 12 bundled vs. 24 ± 10 separated; p < 0.01). When SILS was compared to TRD with the cords separated, SILS increased stray energy at both the telescope tip and grasper tip (36 ± 10 vs. 24 ± 10 °C; p < 0.01 and 34 ± 11 vs. 17 ± 8 °C; p < 0.01). CONCLUSION SILS increases stray energy transfer nearly twice as much as TRD with the use of the monopolar instrument. Strategies to mitigate the amount of stray energy in the TRD setup such as separation of the active electrode and camera cords are not effective in the SILS setup. These practical findings should enhance surgeons using the SILS approach of increased stray energy that could result in injury.","Townsend, Nicole T; Jones, Edward L; Overbey, Doug; Dunne, Bruce; McHenry, Jennifer; Robinson, Thomas N",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-5339-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27864716/,359

The Pub and the People is a classic text for its distinctly sociological approach, seeing patterns of drinking and socialising in context rather than focusing primarily on pathological consequences. The main conclusions were that the pub is a living social organism and that the traditional approach of British sociology, which, MO argued, focused on 'the drink problem' and the links between alcohol, crime and delinquency, failed to take account of the full social context. Mass Observation's focus on the pub as a place anticipates themes taken up in work on alcohol in cultural geography. Later alcohol researchers and epidemiologists have continued this orientation, recognising the importance of physical and social environments in relation to alcohol consumption. Other studies have built on the MO initiative by looking at how drug and alcohol consumption links to identity, friendship and sociality or at the connections between intoxication and pleasure. The value of this classic text is that it reminds us that paying attention to the social context is not just a useful supplement but absolutely central to understanding the use of alcohol or drugs.","MacGregor, Susanne",Addiction,https://doi.org/10.1111/add.15220; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32770849/,359

However, they do not provide trainees with meaningful information about how to improve their skills. The objective of this study was to provide preliminary validity evidence for the creation a formative feedback tool (FFT) for advanced laparoscopic suturing skills. METHODS Videotapes of senior surgical residents (PGY3-5; SRs) and minimally invasive surgeons (MIS) performing 3 advanced laparoscopic suturing tasks were analyzed: needle handling (NH), suturing under tension (UT), and continuous suturing (CS). A FFT was created based on a grounded theory analysis of interviews with MIS surgeons about the key technical aspects of each task. The FFT was used to assess the videotaped performances of SRs and MIS surgeons by two blinded independent raters. RESULTS The FFT is composed of three parts: NH contains 10 items, UT 18, and CS 20. Each item was classified according to seven key surgical principles: depth perception, safety, bimanual dexterity, exposure, tissue handling, instrument manipulation, and forward planning. The videotaped performance of SR and MIS surgeons was graded on a 3-point Likert scale (""does well,"" ""needs some improvement,"" and ""does poorly"") and scores were calculated as a sum of the points. ICCs for all three tasks were high (NH 0.90, UT 0.87, and CS 0.90). FFT score correlated strongly with combined time and accuracy measurements for UT (0.82, p < 0.01) and CS (0.81, p < 0.01), and moderately for NH (0.65, p < 0.01). MIS surgeons performed significantly better than SRs on UT (p = 0.02) and CS (p = 0.05), while scores on NH were similar (p = 0.57). CONCLUSIONS A comprehensive tool for providing feedback about advanced laparoscopic suturing skills was developed. The FFT demonstrates evidence for validity as a measure of suturing skills and experience, and provides meaningful information to trainees about how to improve their skills and engage in more deliberate and efficient practice.","McKendy, Katherine M; Watanabe, Yusuke; Bilgic, Elif; Enani, Ghada; Munshi, Amani; Lee, Lawrence; Feldman, Liane S; Fried, Gerald M; Vassiliou, Melina C",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5569-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28444495/,359

71695,Covid-19: Anti-TNF drug adalimumab to be trialled for patients in the community.,2020-10-01,"BACKGROUND The rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 in the United States led to a variety of mandates intended to decrease population movement and ""flatten the curve."" However, there is evidence some are not able to stay-at-home due to certain disadvantages, thus remaining exposed to both coronavirus disease 2019 and trauma. We therefore sought to identify any unequal effects of the California stay-at-home orders between races and insurance statuses in a multicenter study utilizing trauma volume data. METHODS A posthoc multicenter retrospective analysis of trauma patients presenting to 11 centers in Southern California between the dates of January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020, and January 1, 2019, and June 30, 2019, was performed. The number of trauma patients of each race/insurance status was tabulated per day. We then calculated the changes in trauma volume related to stay-at-home orders for each race/insurance status and compared the magnitude of these changes using statistical resampling. RESULTS Compared to baseline, there was a 40.1% drop in total trauma volume, which occurred 20 days after stay-at-home orders. During stay-at-home orders, the average daily trauma volume of patients with Medicaid increased by 13.7 ± 5.3%, whereas the volume of those with Medicare, private insurance, and no insurance decreased. The average daily trauma volume decreased for White, Black, Asian, and Latino patients with the volume of Black and Latino patients dropping to a similar degree compared to White patients. CONCLUSION This retrospective multicenter study demonstrated that patients with Medicaid had a paradoxical increase in trauma volume during stay-at-home orders, suggesting that the most impoverished groups remain disproportionately exposed to trauma during a pandemic, further exacerbating existing health disparities.","Yeates, Eric O; Juillard, Catherine; Grigorian, Areg; Schellenberg, Morgan; Owattanapanich, Natthida; Barmparas, Galinos; Margulies, Daniel; Garber, Kent; Cryer, Henry; Tillou, Areti; Burruss, Sigrid; Penaloza-Villalobos, Liz; Lin, Ann; Figueras, Ryan Arthur; Brenner, Megan; Firek, Christopher; Costantini, Todd; Santorelli, Jarrett; Curry, Terry; Wintz, Diane; Biffl, Walter L; Schaffer, Kathryn B; Duncan, Thomas K; Barbaro, Casey; Diaz, Graal; Johnson, Arianne; Chinn, Justine; Naaseh, Ariana; Leung, Amanda; Grabar, Christina; Yeates, Todd O; Nahmias, Jeffry",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2021.02.060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33849732/,359

Method: Cross-sectional survey conducted online on registered practising ophthalmologists of India, post lockdown at the start of elective surgeries (20th to 25th May, 2020). The degree of symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress was assessed by DASS -21 questionnaire. DASS -Subscales: DASS- D (depression), DASS- A (anxiety) and DASS-S (stress) and grading of severity (mild, moderate, severe) were analysed. Results: A total of 144 ophthalmologists aged 29-72 years responded to online survey. Of all participants, 94 (64.2%) of ophthalmologists suffered from mental health problems. Seventy six (52.7%) ophthalmologists had depression and anxiety whereas 20 (14%) reported stress. Women ophthalmologists scored highest total DASS mean score and DASS-stress mean score (p = .04 and p = .03). Results of DASS-D and DASS-A showed female preponderance (men vs women 42.5% vs 61.5%, p = .02; 42.5% vs 60%, p = .04). Severity of symptoms revealed that ophthalmologists above 40 years of age with more than 10 years' experienced severe stress (p = .005). Comprehensive ophthalmologists presented with severe stress and ophthalmologists practicing speciality with severe anxiety. Pearson's correlation analysis showed positive correlation between total DASS-21 score with each of the three subscales scores (DASS D, r-0.88: p < .001; DASS-A, r = 0.96: p = <0.001; DASS-S, r = 0.95: p < .001). Conclusion: Screening by Dass-21 scale has brought noticeable transient mental health issue among ophthalmologist to the fore.

Current first-line treatments include psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. Despite significant success, a number of patients do not benefit sufficiently. Progress is limited by an incomplete understanding of the -neurobiology of insomnia and hypersomnia. This work summarizes current concepts of the regulation of arousal and sleep and its modulation through noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS), including transcranial magnetic, current, and auditory stimulation. Particularly, we suggest: (1) characterization of patients with sleep problems - across diagnostic entities of mental disorders - based on specific alterations of sleep, including alterations of sleep slow waves, sleep spindles, cross-frequency coupling of brain oscillations, local sleep-wake regulation, and REM sleep and (2) targeting these with specific NIBS techniques. While evidence is accumulating that the modulation of specific alterations of sleep through NIBS is feasible, it remains to be tested whether this translates to clinically relevant effects and new treatment developments.","Geiser, Tim; Hertenstein, Elisabeth; Fehér, Kristoffer; Maier, Jonathan G; Schneider, Carlotta L; Züst, Marc A; Wunderlin, Marina; Mikutta, Christian; Klöppel, Stefan; Nissen, Christoph",Neuropsychobiology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000507372; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408296/,359

In other studies histological parameters including pleomorphic features and growth patterns were also shown to exert prognostic impact. The primary aims of our study are (1) externally validate the prognostic role of pleomorphic features in E-MPM and (2) investigate if evaluating growth pattern in addition to 2-tier nuclear grade improves prognostication. METHODS AND RESULTS 614 consecutive cases of E-MPM from our institution over a period of 15 years were retrospectively reviewed, of which 51 showed pleomorphic features. E-MPM with pleomorphic features showed significantly worse overall survival compared those without (5.4 months vs 14.7 months). Tumours with predominantly micropapillary pattern showed the worst survival (6.2 months) followed by solid (10.5 months), microcystic (15.3 months), discohesive (16.1 months), trabecular (17.6 months) and tubulo-papillary (18.6 months). Sub-classification of growth patterns into high grade (solid, micropapillary) and low grade (all others) led to good separation of overall survival (10.5 months vs. 18.0 months) but did not predict survival independent of 2-tier nuclear grade. A composite score comprised of growth pattern and 2-tier nuclear grade did not improve prognostication compared with nuclear grade alone. Intra-tumoural heterogeneity in growth patterns is ubiquitous. CONCLUSIONS Our findings support the incorporation of E-MPM with pleomorphic features in the epithelioid subtype as a highly aggressive variant distinct from 2-tier nuclear grade. E-MPM demonstrates extensive heterogeneity in growth pattern but its evaluation does not offer additional prognostic utility to 2-tier nuclear grade.","Zhang, Yu Zhi; Brambilla, Cecilia; Molyneaux, Philip L; Rice, Alexandra; Robertus, Jan Lukas; Jordan, Simon; Lim, Eric; Lang-Lazdunski, Loic; Begum, Sofina; Dusmet, Michael; Anikin, Vladimir; Beddow, Emma; Finch, Jonathan; Asadi, Nizar; Popat, Sanjay; Le Quesne, John; Husain, Aliya N; Cookson, William Ocm; Moffatt, Miriam F; Nicholson, Andrew G",Histopathology,https://doi.org/10.1111/his.14127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32333813/,359
74749,"Covid-19: Pregnant women should be offered Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, says UK advisory committee.",2021-04-19,"Mitochondria share extensive evolutionary conservation across nearly all living species. This homology allows robust insights to be gained into pathophysiologic mechanisms and therapeutic targets for the heterogeneous class of primary mitochondrial diseases through the study of diverse in vitro cellular and in vivo animal models. Dramatic advances in genetic technologies, ranging from RNA interference to achieve graded knock-down of gene expression to CRISPR/Cas-based gene editing that yields a stable gene knock-out or targeted mutation knock-in, have enabled the ready establishment of mitochondrial disease models for a plethora of individual nuclear gene disorders. These models are complemented and extended by the use of pharmacologic inhibitor-based stressors to characterize variable degrees, onset, duration, and combinations of acute on chronic mitochondrial dysfunction in individual respiratory chain enzyme complexes or distinct biochemical pathways in mitochondria. Herein is described the rationale for, and progress made in, ""therapeutic cross-training"", a novel approach meant to improve the validity and rigor of experimental conclusions when testing therapies by studying treatment effects in multiple, evolutionarily-distinct species, including C. elegans (invertebrate, worm), D. rerio (vertebrate, zebrafish), M. musculus (mammal, mouse), and/or human patient primary fibroblast cell line models of primary mitochondrial disease. The goal of these pre-clinical studies is to identify lead therapies from candidate molecules or library screens that consistently demonstrate efficacy, with minimal toxicity, in specific subtypes of mitochondrial disease. Conservation of in vitro and in vivo therapeutic effects of lead molecules across species has proven extensive, where molar concentrations found to be toxic or efficacious in one species are often consistent with therapeutic effects at similar doses seen in other mitochondrial disease models. Phenotypic outcome studies in all models are prioritized at the level of survival and function, to reflect the ultimate goal of developing highly potent therapies for human mitochondrial disease. Lead compounds that demonstrate significant benefit on gross phenotypes may be further scrutinized in these same models to decipher their cellular targets, mechanism(s), and detailed biochemical effects. High-throughput, automated technologic advances will be discussed that enable efficient, parallel screening in a diverse mitochondrial disease disorders and overarching subclasses of compounds, concentrations, libraries, and combinations. Overall, this therapeutic cross-training approach has proven valuable to identify compounds with optimal potency and safety profiles among major biochemical subtypes or specific genetic etiologies of mitochondrial disease. This approach further supports rational prioritization of lead compounds, target concentrations, and specific disease phenotypes, outcomes, and subgroups to optimally inform the design of clinical trials that test their efficacy in human mitochondrial disease subjects.

BACKGROUND In evidence-based practice, nursing decision-making is based on scientific evidence, evidence of best practice and individual patient preferences. Little is known about how nurses in hospitals take into account patient preferences in nursing decision-making. DESIGN Qualitative grounded theory. METHODS Data collection entailed 27 semi-structured interviews with nurses designated by their colleagues as excellent caregivers, followed by 57 hours of participant observation. Data analysis was conducted using three-level coding with constant comparison and theoretical sampling. The COREQ checklist for qualitative research was followed. RESULTS A main finding was that participants used three implicit tools to discover patient preferences: establishing a connection, using antennae and asking empathic questions, thus instantly reassuring patients from the very first contact. Their starting point in care was the patient's perception of quality of life wherein they shifted towards their patient's perspective: ""Teach me to provide the best care for you in this situation."" During the observations, it was confirmed that the excellent nurses behaved as they had described before. CONCLUSION Excellent nurses actively turn towards patients' expectations and experienced quality of life by carefully blending individual sensitive and situation specific patient preferences with scientific evidence and evidence of best practice. In doing so, they are able to balancing more equally patient preferences in to the equation called evidence-based practice, thus leading to wise decision-making in personalised nursing care.

This obstacle often is compounded by the tight clustering of homologous genes, which precludes the generation of multi-gene-deficient animals through standard interbreeding of single-deficient animals. Here, we describe an iterative, multiplexed CRISPR-based approach for simultaneous gene editing in the complex seven-member HAT/DESC cluster of membrane-anchored serine proteases. Through four cycles of targeting, we generated a library of 18 unique congenic mouse strains lacking combinations of HAT/DESC proteases, including a mouse strain deficient in all seven proteases. Using this library, we demonstrate that HAT/DESC proteases are dispensable for term development, postnatal health, and fertility, and that the recently described function of the HAT-like 4 protease in epidermal barrier formation is unique among all HAT/DESC proteases. The study demonstrates the potential of iterative, multiplexed CRISPR-mediated gene editing for functional analysis of multi-gene clusters, and it provides a large array of new congenic mouse strains for the study of HAT/DESC proteases in physiological and in pathophysiological processes.","Callies, LuLu K; Tadeo, Daniel; Simper, Jan; Bugge, Thomas H; Szabo, Roman",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra119.009773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31501243/,359

Patients diagnosed as severe or critical cases are prone to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome and even death. Proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 has been reported to be associated with the severity of disease and mortality in patients with COVID-19. OBJECTIVE This systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out to evaluate the association between IL-6 and severe disease and mortality in COVID-19 disease. METHODS A systematic literature search using China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang databases, China Science and Technology Journal Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature, Embase, PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was performed from inception until 16 January 2021. RESULTS 12 studies reported the value of IL-6 for predicting the severe disease in patients with COVID-19. The pooled area under the curve (AUC) was 0.85 (95% CI 0.821 to 0.931). 5 studies elaborated the predictive value of IL-6 on mortality. The pooled sensitivity, specificity and AUC were 0.15 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.17, I2=98.9%), 0.73 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.79, I2=91.8%) and 0.531 (95% CI 0.451 to 0.612), respectively. Meta-regression analysis showed that country, technique used, cut-off, sample, study design and detection time did not contribute to the heterogeneity of mortality. CONCLUSION IL-6 is an adequate predictor of severe disease in patients infected with the COVID-19. The finding of current study may guide clinicians and healthcare providers in identifying potentially severe or critical patients with COVID-19 at the initial stage of the disease. Moreover, we found that only monitoring IL-6 levels does not seem to predict mortality and was not associated with COVID-19's mortality.

79629,Inequities During COVID-19.,2020-08-01,"Microbubble contrast agents hold great promise for drug delivery applications with ultrasound. Encapsulating drugs in nanoparticles reduces systemic toxicity and increases circulation time of the drugs. In a novel approach to microbubble-assisted drug delivery, nanoparticles are incorporated in or on microbubble shells, enabling local and triggered release of the nanoparticle payload with ultrasound. A thorough understanding of the release mechanisms within the vast ultrasound parameter space is crucial for efficient and controlled release. This set of presented protocols is applicable to microbubbles with a shell containing a fluorescent label. Here, the focus is on microbubbles loaded with poly(2-ethyl-butyl cyanoacrylate) polymeric nanoparticles, doped with a modified Nile Red dye. The particles are fixed within a denatured casein shell. The microbubbles are produced by vigorous stirring, forming a dispersion of perfluoropropane gas in the liquid phase containing casein and nanoparticles, after which the microbubble shell self-assembles. A variety of microscopy techniques are needed to characterize the nanoparticle-stabilized microbubbles at all relevant timescales of the nanoparticle release process. Fluorescence of the nanoparticles enables confocal imaging of single microbubbles, revealing the particle distribution within the shell. In vitro ultra-high-speed imaging using bright-field microscopy at 10 million frames per second provides insight into the bubble dynamics in response to ultrasound insonation. Finally, nanoparticle release from the bubble shell is best visualized by means of fluorescence microscopy, performed at 500,000 frames per second. To characterize drug delivery in vivo, the triggered release of nanoparticles within the vasculature and their extravasation beyond the endothelial layer is studied using intravital microscopy in tumors implanted in dorsal skinfold window chambers, over a timescale of several minutes. The combination of these complementary characterization techniques provides unique insight into the behavior of microbubbles and their payload release at a range of time and length scales, both in vitro and in vivo.","Nawijn, Charlotte; Segers, Tim; Lajoinie, Guillaume; Mørch, Ýrr; Berg, Sigrid; Snipstad, Sofie; de Lange Davies, Catharina; Versluis, Michel",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,https://doi.org/10.3791/62251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180885/,359

Numerous hospital-based investigations have revealed the RSV prevalence between 0.2-54% in the paediatric population with ARI/ALRI from Saudi Arabia during 1991-2015. Maximum RSV infections occurred in children less than 1 year of age (51-97%) and male children (51-69%) were more commonly affected than females (31-49%). RSV infections are reported mostly during winter season suggesting seasonal distribution of the virus. Other respiratory viruses reported from this region are adenovirus, influenza, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus and rhinovirus including many mixed infections. A few studies have reported the phylogenetic analysis of the circulating strains of RSV. These studies have revealed that circulating group A-RSV Saudi strains belonged to NA1 and ON1 genotypes and group B-RSV viruses clustered in the BA genotype. Molecular characterization of the Saudi strains was further carried out by mutational, selection pressure and glycosylation site analyses. We have compiled all the eighteen studies of RSV infection from Saudi Arabia in the form of this review and concluded that detailed comprehensive surveillance of RSV and other viruses in community and hospital settings is required. Information on the molecular characterization of currently circulating strains of RSV will contribute towards better understanding of the epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics of this viral pathogen.

Building evidence during the COVID-19 emergency reported that around 50% of patients in Italy treated with NIV-CPAP avoided the need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Standard NIV-CPAP systems operate at high gas flow rates responsible for noise generation and inadequate humidification. Furthermore, open configuration systems require a high concentration of oxygen to deliver the desired FiO2 . Concerns outlined the risk for aerosolization in the ambient and the possible pressure drop in hospital supply pipes. A new NIV-CPAP system is proposed that includes automatic control of patient respiratory parameters. The system operates as a closed-loop breathing circuit that can be assembled, combining a sleep apnea machine with existing commercially available components. Analytical simulation of breathing patient and simulation with a healthy volunteer at different FiO2 were performed. Inspired and expired oxygen fraction, inspired and expired carbon dioxide pressure were recorded at different CPAP levels with different oxygen delivery. Among the main findings, we report (1) a significant (up to 30-fold) reduction in oxygen feeding compared to standard open high flow NIV-CPAP systems, to assure the same FiO2 levels, and (2) a negligible production of the noise generated in ventilatory systems, and consequent minimization of patients' discomfort. The proposed NIV-CPAP circuit, reshaped in closed-loop configuration with the blower outside of the circuit, has the advantages of minimizing aerosol generation, environmental contamination, oxygen consumption, and noise to the patient. The system is easily adaptable and can be implemented using standard CPAP components.","Cavaglià, Marco; Olivieri, Carlo; Morbiducci, Umberto; Raparelli, Terenziano; Jacazio, Giovanni; Ivanov, Alexandre; Chiesa, Alessandro; Savino, Dario; Chiarenza, Sebastiano M; Romiti, Armando; Romiti, Andrea; Ferrara, Marino; Musso, Giuseppe; Audenino, Alberto",Artificial organs,https://doi.org/10.1111/aor.13888; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33326636/,359

We aimed to determine the societal burden (incidence, health-care consumption and productivity loss) and correlates of ILI in households with preschool children. METHODS A survey was performed in the Netherlands during October 2012 to October 2014. Monthly, 2000 households with children younger than 4 years were invited to report their symptoms and related medical care, productivity loss and putative risk exposures for 1 preschool child and 1 parent. RESULTS Eight thousand seven hundred and sixty-eight child-parent pairs were enrolled. ILI incidence was 2.81 episodes/child-year and 1.72 episodes/parent-year. Amongst those with ILI, health-care utilization was 35.7% (children) and 17.7% (parents). Work absenteeism was 45.7% (median 2 workdays lost) and day-care absenteeism was 22.8% (median 1 day missed). Chronic respiratory conditions, developmental disabilities, parental occupation in health care/child care, having a sibling and attending day care for ≤12 months increased childhood ILI risk. Parental ILI risk increased with having chronic respiratory conditions, developmentally disabled day-care-attending children and female gender in interaction with unemployment and multiple day-care-attending children. Breastfeeding infants 6-month-old or younger and attending day care for >24 months decreased childhood ILI risk. Pregnancy, occupation in health care and having ≥3 children decreased parental ILI risk. Parents of ILI-affected children had a concurrent 4-fold higher ILI risk. CONCLUSION ILI in households with preschool children has a considerable societal impact. Risk-mitigating initiatives seem justified for day-care attendees, mothers, people with chronic respiratory conditions, and children with developmental disabilities. Children attending day care for >2 years acquire some protection to ILI.","Mughini-Gras, Lapo; Pijnacker, Roan; Enserink, Remko; Heusinkveld, Moniek; van der Hoek, Wim; van Pelt, Wilfrid",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000000988; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26646550/,359

The aim of this study was to develop a measuring system for different instruments and manipulations in LESS using a single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) port. METHODS The loads on the SILS port were applied and recorded by the universal material testing machine by the following method. The handle of the forceps inserted in the SILS port was connected with the machine by a fishing wire and pulled at a constant rate. The surface deformations (displacements and strains) of the SILS port were recorded with digital image correlation (DIC) simultaneously. The correlation between deformation measurements and loads were analyzed. This experiment was repeated 8 times. RESULTS Strong correlations existed between deformation measurements calculated by DIC and objective criteria ""loads"" applied and recorded by the universal material testing machine (r>0.98). The correlation coefficients were statistically significant (P<.001). A high repeatability of the results appeared in all repetitions of the experiment. CONCLUSIONS A DIC measurement system has been developed for LESS, and comprehensive mechanical parameters of a SILS port can be obtained precisely by using this system. It is reliable and repeatable for evaluation of instruments and manipulations in LESS.","Xu, An An; Zhu, Jiang Fan; Zhang, Dongsheng",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.4293/jsls.2014.00267; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25392628/,359

85364,Is there a role for cough suppression techniques in the COVID-19 era?,2020-11-10,"BACKGROUND Telemedicine and telemonitoring have become invaluable tools in managing chronic diseases, such as heart failure (HF). With the recent pandemic, telemedicine has become the preferred method of providing consultative care. LOCAL PROBLEM This rapid paradigm shift from face-to-face (F2F) consultations to telemedicine required a collaborative approach for successful implementation while maintaining quality of care. The processes for conducting a telemedicine visit for HF patient are not well defined or outlined. METHOD Using a collaborative practice model and nurse practitioner led program, technology was leveraged to manage the high-risk HF population using virtual care (consultation via phone or video-to-home) with two aims: first to provide ongoing HF care using available telemedicine technologies or F2F care when necessary and, second, to evaluate and direct those needing urgent/emergent level of care to emergency department (ED). INTERVENTION The process was converted into an intuitive algorithm that describes essential elements and team roles necessary for execution of a successful HF consultation. RESULTS Following the algorithm, nurse practitioners conducted 132 visits, yielding 100% success in the conversion of F2F appointments to telemedicine, with 3 patients referred to ED for care. The information obtained through telemedicine consultation accurately informed decision for ED evaluation with resultant admission. CONCLUSION Collaborative team-based approach delineated in the algorithm facilitated successful virtual consultations for HF patients and accurately informed decisions for higher level of care.","de Peralta, Shelly S; Ziaeian, Boback; Chang, Donald S; Goldberg, Sarah; Vetrivel, Reeta; Fang, Yichun M",Journal of the American Association of Nurse Practitioners,https://doi.org/10.1097/jxx.0000000000000573; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33625164/,359

Dyspnea and tachypnea developed 1-2 days postoperatively in each patient, and chylous effusion was detected on thoracocentesis. For each case, a diagnosis of chylothorax was based on cytology and triglyceride concentrations of the aspirated pleural fluid. Similar protocols for monitoring were used in the treatment of each patient's chylothorax. The duration and volume of chylous effusion production were closely monitored via routine thoracostomy tube aspiration. Both dogs rapidly progressed to recovery with no additional complications.

85828,Presidential Address: Perseverance through the pandemic and beyond.,2020-11-17,"Accurate estimates of virus mutation rates are important to understand the evolution of the viruses and to combat them. However, methods of estimation are varied and often complex. Here, we critically review over 40 original studies and establish criteria to facilitate comparative analyses. The mutation rates of 23 viruses are presented as substitutions per nucleotide per cell infection (s/n/c) and corrected for selection bias where necessary, using a new statistical method. The resulting rates range from 10(-8) to 10(-6) s/n/c for DNA viruses and from 10(-6) to 10(-4) s/n/c for RNA viruses. Similar to what has been shown previously for DNA viruses, there appears to be a negative correlation between mutation rate and genome size among RNA viruses, but this result requires further experimental testing. Contrary to some suggestions, the mutation rate of retroviruses is not lower than that of other RNA viruses. We also show that nucleotide substitutions are on average four times more common than insertions/deletions (indels). Finally, we provide estimates of the mutation rate per nucleotide per strand copying, which tends to be lower than that per cell infection because some viruses undergo several rounds of copying per cell, particularly double-stranded DNA viruses. A regularly updated virus mutation rate data set will be available at www.uv.es/rsanjuan/virmut.","Sanjuán, Rafael; Nebot, Miguel R; Chirico, Nicola; Mansky, Louis M; Belshaw, Robert",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00694-10; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20660197/,359
85936,Investigating Whether Blood Type Is Linked to COVID-19 Risk.,2020-09-16,"In Europe, the mean incidence of urinary tract infections in intensive care units is 1.1 per 1000 patient-days. Of these cases, catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) account for 98%. In total, CAUTI in hospitals is estimated to give additional health-care costs of £1-2.5 billion in the United Kingdom alone. This is in sharp contrast to the low cost of urinary catheters and emphasizes the need for innovative products that reduce the incidence rate of CAUTI. Ureteral stents and other urinary-tract devices suffer similar problems. Antimicrobial strategies are being developed, however, the evaluation of their efficacy is very challenging. This review aims to provide considerations and recommendations covering all relevant aspects of antimicrobial material testing, including surface characterization, biocompatibility, cytotoxicity, in vitro and in vivo tests, microbial strain selection, and hydrodynamic conditions, all in the perspective of complying to the complex pathology of device-associated urinary tract infection. The recommendations should be on the basis of standard assays to be developed which would enable comparisons of results obtained in different research labs both in industry and in academia, as well as provide industry and academia with tools to assess the antimicrobial properties for urinary tract devices in a reliable way.","Ramstedt, Madeleine; Ribeiro, Isabel A C; Bujdakova, Helena; Mergulhão, Filipe J M; Jordao, Luisa; Thomsen, Peter; Alm, Martin; Burmølle, Mette; Vladkova, Todorka; Can, Fusun; Reches, Meital; Riool, Martijn; Barros, Alexandre; Reis, Rui L; Meaurio, Emilio; Kikhney, Judith; Moter, Annette; Zaat, Sebastian A J; Sjollema, Jelmer",Macromolecular bioscience,https://doi.org/10.1002/mabi.201800384; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30884146/,359
86197,Isolation through rubber dam to prevent COVID-19 exposure during flapless trans-crestal sinus lift procedures.,2020-08-11,"INTRODUCTION Limited cutaneous systemic sclerosis (lcSSc) is the most frequent subset of systemic sclerosis. Despite this, lcSSc is not the major focus of clinical studies. The lack of interventional studies in lcSSc is due, in part, to a paucity of relevant outcome measures to effectively evaluate this subset. A combined response index dedicated to lcSSc would facilitate development of well-designed trials and approval of new drugs. The objective of this scoping review is to perform a broad and comprehensive identification of the outcome measures (core set items) within relevant domains, which have been used so far to assess lcSSc. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The planned scoping review will be based on the approach proposed by Arksey et al and further developed by Levac et al. Development and reporting will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses-Extension for Scoping Reviews checklist and guidelines. The development of the search strategy was guided by the concepts of domains and outcomes based on the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology approach and by the different names and definitions of SSc, with a specific emphasis on their occurrence in clinical trial studies. Two databases will be searched: MEDLINE and Embase. Studies in English, published from the year 1988 onwards, will be included, since 1988 corresponds to the publication of LeRoy's first consensus definition of lcSSc. Data will be extracted and analysed using a standardised charting tool. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION No ethical approval is required for this study. The results will be submitted to an international peer-reviewed journal and scientific conferences, informing the discussion on which items should be included in a combined response index dedicated to lcSSc (the CRISTAL project: Combined Response Index for Scleroderma Trial Assessing lcSSc).","Lescoat, Alain; Roofeh, David; Townsend, Whitney; Hughes, Michael; Sandler, Robert D; Zimmermann, François; Pauling, John D; Buch, Maya H; Khanna, Dinesh",BMJ open,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-044765; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33707273/,359

86800,Changes in Thyroid fine needle aspiration practice during the Covid-19 pandemic.,2021-06-16,"Background: During the first two waves of COVID-19, several physical restriction measurements were imposed in Belgium. Our aim was to explore the impact of these restriction measures on the number of tests and positivity rate of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT)/Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) before, during, and after the two lockdowns in Belgium. Methods: Chlamydia trachomatis/Neisseria gonorrhoeae molecular data of a Belgian STI clinic were extracted for 2019 and 2020, and both years were divided into four periods (pre-lockdown 1, lockdown 1, after lockdown 1, and lockdown 2). Weekly testing rates and positivity rate for both STIs were estimated, and mixed-effects logistic regression was used to explore statistical significant changes between both years, and the different periods were compared with the corresponding time period in 2019. The same analysis was done for pre-exposure prophylaxis(PrEP) users only. Results: No overall significant changes in positivity rate were found for either CT (8.0% in 2019 and 7.8% in 2020) or NG (4.5% in 2019 and 5.5% in 2020). Besides a significant drop in the number of CT/NG tests during lockdown 1 (decrease of 87%) and a subsequent increase in NG positivity rate (p > 0.05), no changes in CT/NG positivity rate were found in the other periods. The highest positivity rate for either CT or NG was found in lockdown 2 (15.1% vs 12.4% in 2019). The number of CT/NG tests in lockdown 2 was still 25% lower than 2019 levels. Subanalysis of only PrEP users revealed the same trend; however, the number of CT/NG tests in lockdown 2 was exactly the same as in 2019. Conclusion: Despite a significant decline in absolute CT or NG cases in lockdown 1, which was most likely a consequence of both physical distancing and reduced testing, CT/NG testing and positivity rates returned to pre-corona levels in lockdown 2, which may depict physical distancing fatigue.","De Baetselier, Irith; Apers, Ludwig; Platteau, Tom; Buyze, Jozefien; Florence, Eric; Kenyon, Chris; Van den Bossche, Dorien",International journal of STD & AIDS,https://doi.org/10.1177/09564624211013289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34096386/,359
87224,Researchers Home in on COVID-19 Severity Biomarkers.,2020-07-14,"Proinflammatory cytokines play a central role in depression-like behaviour and apoptosis in the limbic system after myocardial infarction (MI). A PUFA n-3 diet or the combination of Lactobacillus helveticus R0052 and Bifidobacterium longum R0175 probiotics, when given before the ischaemic period, reduce circulating proinflammatory cytokines as well as apoptosis in the limbic system. The present study was designed to determine if the same nutritional interventions maintain their beneficial effects when started after the onset of the reperfusion period and attenuate depression-like behaviour observed after MI. MI was induced by the occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 40 min in rats. After the onset of reperfusion, animals were fed with a high- or low-PUFA n-3 diet, combined or not with one billion live bacteria of L. helveticus and B. longum. At 3 d post-MI, caspase-3 enzymatic activities and terminal 2'-deoxyuridine, 5'-triphosphate (dUTP) nick-end labelling (TUNEL)-positive cells were decreased in the CA1, dentate gyrus (DG) and amygdala with the high-PUFA n-3 diet, as compared to the three other diets. Probiotics attenuated caspase-3 activity and TUNEL-positive cells in the DG and the medial amygdala. At 2 weeks post-MI, depression-like behaviour was observed in the low-PUFA n-3 diet without probiotics-group, and this behaviour was attenuated with the high-PUFA n-3 diet or/and probiotics. These results indicate that a high-PUFA n-3 diet or the administration of probiotics, starting after the onset of reperfusion, are beneficial to attenuate apoptosis in the limbic system and post-MI depression in the rat.","Gilbert, Kim; Arseneault-Bréard, Jessica; Flores Monaco, Fabio; Beaudoin, Alexanne; Bah, Thierno Madjou; Tompkins, Thomas A; Godbout, Roger; Rousseau, Guy",The British journal of nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0007114512003807; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23068715/,359

Objective To explore the practices of management of spinal induced hypotension with respect to fluid and vasopressor administration among anesthesiologists from a developing country. Methods After approval from institutional ethics committee, an online questionnaire was sent to anesthesiologists registered with Pakistan Society of Anesthesiologists between July and August 2018 to determine management strategies for prevention and treatment of spinal-induced hypotension. Results The response rate was 36% (156/433), majority from academic institution (62.8%) with equal representation from attending and trainee anesthesiologist. For prophylaxis 39.1% respondents did not use vasopressors, 32.7% used fluid preloading with crystalloids (54.7%) as fluid of choice followed by combination of co-loading and vasopressor(22.4%). Phenylephrine was the vasopressor of choice for both prophylaxis (33.1%) and treatment (57%). Attending anesthesiologist used a combination of fluid co-loading and vasopressors for prophylaxis as compared to trainee anesthesiologists (37.2% vs. 17.9%; P=0.035) and selected vasopressors according to patient's heart rate (33.3% vs. 19.5%; p=0.05). Prophylactic phenylephrine was used more by respondents from the academic institution (p=0.023). Fluid co-loading was used more by respondents with <30 % compared to those with > 30% of clinical responsibility to obstetric anesthesia (P<0.05). Conclusion Phenylephrine as the vasopressor of choice indicates growing awareness of management strategies among anesthesiologists from developing countries but there is a need to increase its use for prophylaxis. Some variation in practice according to the level of anesthesiologist, practice type and responsibilities to obstetric anesthesia are evident.","Ismail, Samina; Sohaib, Muhammad; Farrukh, Fatima",African health sciences,https://doi.org/10.4314/ahs.v20i4.50; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394258/,359
88819,CHECK UP: A student-designed model for creating innovative patient education materials that your patients will actually use.,2021-07-27,"AIMS Reflux symptoms are highly prevalent and non-specific; hence, in the absence of alarm symptoms, endoscopy referral decisions are challenging. This study evaluated whether a non-endoscopic Cytosponge could detect benign oesophageal pathologies and thus have future potential in triaging patients with persistent symptoms. METHODS AND RESULTS Two complementary cohorts were recruited: (i) patients with reflux symptoms and no prior endoscopy (n = 409), and (ii) patients with reflux symptoms referred for endoscopy (n = 411). All patients were investigated using the Cytosponge and endoscopy. Significant epithelial inflammation was present in 130 (16%) Cytosponge samples, 32 of which had ulcer slough. Candida and significant inflammation was detected in a further 22 (2.3%) cases; epithelial infiltration with >15 eosinophils/high-power field reflecting possible eosinophilic oesophagitis (EOE) in five (0.6%); and viral inclusions suggestive of herpes oesophagitis in one (0.1%). No significant pathology was detected in the majority, 662 (81%), of Cytosponge samples. Cytosponge and endoscopy findings were in agreement in 574 (70%) cases, in 165 (67%) of the discordant cases one investigation showed mild inflammation while the other was negative, with an additional 22 (8.9%) differing on the extent of inflammation. Eighteen cases with severe inflammation, six with candida and two with EOE were detected only at endoscopy, while 18 with candida and significant inflammation, 13 with ulcer slough, one probable EOE and one viral oesophagitis were identified on the Cytosponge only. CONCLUSIONS The Cytosponge detects a range of benign oesophageal pathologies, and therefore has potential clinical utility in the triaging of patients with troublesome reflux symptoms. This warrants further investigation.","Paterson, Anna L; Lao-Sirieix, Pierre; O'Donovan, Maria; Debiram-Beecham, Irene; di Pietro, Massimiliano; Miremadi, Ahmad; Attwood, Stephen E; Walter, Fiona M; Sasieni, Peter D; Fitzgerald, Rebecca C",Histopathology,https://doi.org/10.1111/his.13039; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27417524/,359

METHODS Individuals with PBC were identified through ICD-9-CM code 571.6 and/or medical exemption code 008.571.6, from the Banca Dati Assistito of Lombardy. Only health services (outpatient, inpatient activities and drugs) related to PBC were considered to estimate direct medical costs in 2017. RESULTS We identified 970 adult patients (83.5% females) with a mean age of 61 years. Global annual costs were equal to € 913,763 (€ 942 per patient), with € 459,506 (50.3%, € 474 per patient) deriving from hospitalizations (mostly due to liver transplantation, 30.5%, and cirrhosis complications, 20.6%). Costs from outpatient activities were € 109,090 (11.9%, € 112 per patient). CONCLUSIONS This study provides an overview of the costs attributed to PBC care and management, mainly related to hospitalizations for cirrhosis complications, which is necessary for assuring cost-effective introduction of novel therapies.

In an effort to understand how early action to find and control the virus is associated with cumulative outcomes, we explored how country-level testing capacity affects later COVID-19 mortality. METHODS We used the Our World in Data database to explore testing and mortality records in 27 countries from December 31, 2019, to September 30, 2020; we applied Cox proportional hazards regression to determine the relationship between early COVID-19 testing capacity (cumulative tests per case) and later COVID-19 mortality (time to specified mortality thresholds), adjusting for country-level confounders, including median age, GDP, hospital bed capacity, population density, and nonpharmaceutical interventions. RESULTS Higher early testing implementation, as indicated by more cumulative tests per case when mortality was still low, was associated with a lower risk for higher per capita deaths. A sample finding indicated that a higher cumulative number of tests administered per case at the time of six deaths per million persons was associated with a lower risk of reaching 15 deaths per million persons, after adjustment for all confounders (HR = 0.909; P = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Countries that developed stronger COVID-19 testing capacity at early timepoints, as measured by tests administered per case identified, experienced a slower increase of deaths per capita. Thus, this study operationalizes the value of testing and provides empirical evidence that stronger testing capacity at early timepoints is associated with reduced mortality and improved pandemic control.","Kannoth, Sneha; Kandula, Sasikiran; Shaman, Jeffrey",Influenza and other respiratory viruses,https://doi.org/10.1111/irv.12906; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34647421/,359

The elderly, patients with comorbidities and solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients are particularly at risk. We observed a low incidence of severe disease in our population and aimed to determine the outcomes of COVID-19 (disease severity/Intensive care unit [ICU] admissions/mortality) in SOT recipients. METHODS All SOT recipients diagnosed with COVID-19 were included. Their demographic and clinical data were recorded from the hospital electronic system. Patients were assigned to 1 of 4 stages of disease severity: A= asymptomatic, B=mild, C=moderate, and D=severe. RESULTS Of the 3052 SOT recipients, 67 were diagnosed with COVID-19. The mean age was 52 years and 69% were male. There were approximately 25% patients in stage A, 28% in stage B, 34% in stage C and 12% in stage D. Patients in stage C and D were older than those in A (p=0.04) or B (P=0.03). Lactic dehydrogenase (p <0.01) and D-dimer (p <0.01) levels were higher across the stages.Approximately 70% of patients were admitted for a median duration of 9 days and the median follow-up was 35 days. Acute kidney injury occurred in 19% of patients, and 45% required supplementary oxygen. The symptomatic patients were treated with Hydroxychloroquine (83%), Azithromycin (89%) and Tocilizumab (23%).

90929,An Ethical Framework for Allocating Scarce Inpatient Medications for COVID-19 in the US.,2020-05-15,"OBJECTIVE While there is an increasing number of women entering the dental profession, they are still underrepresented in leadership roles in major dental organizations, academia, and journal boards. Keynote and invited speaking roles in professional and scientific conferences recognize expertise and leadership and are key factors in career advancement and academic promotions. The aim of this study was to investigate gender differences in representation at dental continuing professional development (CPD) events and conferences in Australia. METHODS An analysis of the gender of speakers was conducted with CPD and conference programs that are publicly available online from the federal and Victorian branches of the Australian Dental Association, the peak national body for dentists. RESULTS The planned 2020 Victorian Branch CPD program featured 30 events, with a mean 2.5 speakers per event. There were 58 scientific presentations in the schedule, 22 (38%) of which were allocated to female speakers. Seven CPD events in 2020 included only female speakers, and 13 included only male speakers.The 37th and 38th Australian Dental Congresses featured 25% and 36% of female speakers, respectively. All keynote speakers were male for both events, and men accounted for 86% and 93% of international speakers. CONCLUSIONS While women are approaching parity in local and state-level CPD events, there is a large discrepancy in the male-to-female speaker ratio for major national conferences. Suggestions to improve gender imbalance include having women on the convening committee and developing and implementing policies to address the imbalance. There has been significant progress in addressing gender inequity in dentistry, but gender-balanced leadership in major conferences still needs to be addressed. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT The findings of this study show that while women may be approaching parity with small continuing professional development events, they are still underrepresented as speakers in major conferences. It is recommended that active policies be implemented to reduce the imbalance to ensure gender-balanced leadership in one aspect of the dental profession in Australia.","Silva, M; Teoh, L",JDR clinical and translational research,https://doi.org/10.1177/2380084420942163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32689857/,359
91044,Myth Busters: Dietary Supplements and COVID-19.,2020-05-12,"OBJECTIVE The purpose of this secondary analysis is to analyze whether both of the processes of the reinforcer pathology model (delay discounting and demand) are predictors of relapse up to 12-month follow-up in a sample of abstinent smokers who received a smoking cessation treatment. METHOD Participants were 202 abstinent smokers who completed the delay discounting task and the cigarette purchase task. In order to analyze the smoking relapse predictors and the impact of time to relapse, Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis were carried out. RESULTS Fewer years of regular smoking (HR = .79, p = .014), as well as higher delay discounting (HR AUClogd = .80, p = .019) and intensity of demand (HR = 1.26, p = .019) were associated with a higher likelihood of smoking relapse. These variables were associated with a faster relapse. CONCLUSIONS High delay discounting and intensity of demand were associated with a higher risk of relapse after quitting smoking. These findings highlight the importance of adapting treatment strategies for these two variables (delay discounting and cigarette demand), which might confer protective risk against smoking relapse.

Stent-assisted coil embolization helps stabilize the coils within the aneurysm. Permanent placement of a stent in an intracranial vessel, however, requires long-term platelet inhibition. Temporary stent-assisted coiling is an alternative technique for the treatment of wide-neck aneurysms. To date, only case reports and small case series have been published. Our purpose was to retrospectively analyze the effectiveness and safety of temporary stent-assisted coiling in a larger cohort. MATERIALS AND METHODS Research was performed for all patients who had undergone endovascular aneurysm treatment in our institution (University Hospital Aachen) between January 2010 and December 2015. During this period, 355 consecutive patients had undergone endovascular aneurysm treatment. We intended to treat 33 (9.2%) of them with temporary stent-assisted coiling, and they were included in this study. Incidental and acutely ruptured aneurysms were included. RESULTS Sufficient occlusion was achieved in 97.1% of the cases. In 94%, the stent could be fully recovered. Complications occurred in 5 patients (14.7%), whereas in only 1 case was the complication seen as specific to stent-assisted coiling. CONCLUSIONS Temporary stent-assisted coiling is an effective technique for the treatment of wide-neck aneurysms. Safety is comparable with that of stent-assisted coiling and coiling with balloon remodeling.","Müller, M; Brockmann, C; Afat, S; Nikoubashman, O; Schubert, G A; Reich, A; Othman, A E; Wiesmann, M",AJNR.

92863,Strategy for the Practice of Spine Oncological Surgery During the Covid-19 Pandemic.,2020-08-01,"The COVID-19 pandemic, originating in Wuhan, China, has become a major public health and economic challenge for countries around the world. As of May 08, 2020, there are over 3 million COVID-19 cases, and 250,000 COVID-19- associated deaths in 215 countries. As more data is collected, updated infection control measures are continuously released and published by government, public health authorities, and physician specialty associations. Across the globe, dermatological practices have had to limit their operations to varying degrees to facilitate disease control, but as the pandemic subsides, they will broaden their operations. In light of the uncertainty surrounding safe and effective practice of medical and aesthetic dermatology in the era of COVID-19, fourteen international experts in the field contributed to recommendations for effective infection control protocols and practice management modifications. While guidance from the World Health Organization and local public health officials comes first, these recommendations are crafted as a starting point for dermatologists worldwide to commence either reopening their doors to patients or expanding available service offerings. This can help ensure that patients receive needed care in the short term and improve long term practice viability.

92924,"HIV Prevention and Treatment in the Context of the COVID-19 in the Bronx, New York: Implications for Practice and Research.",2020,"SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, uses the viral Spike (S) protein for host cell attachment and entry. The host protease furin cleaves the full-length precursor S glycoprotein into two associated polypeptides: S1 and S2. Cleavage of S generates a polybasic Arg-Arg-Ala-Arg C-terminal sequence on S1, which conforms to a C-end rule (CendR) motif that binds to cell surface Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and Neuropilin-2 (NRP2) receptors. Here, we used X-ray crystallography and biochemical approaches to show that the S1 CendR motif directly bound NRP1. Blocking this interaction using RNAi or selective inhibitors reduced SARS-CoV-2 entry and infectivity in cell culture. NRP1 thus serves as a host factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and may potentially provide a therapeutic target for COVID-19.","Daly, James L; Simonetti, Boris; Klein, Katja; Chen, Kai-En; Williamson, Maia Kavanagh; Antón-Plágaro, Carlos; Shoemark, Deborah K; Simón-Gracia, Lorena; Bauer, Michael; Hollandi, Reka; Greber, Urs F; Horvath, Peter; Sessions, Richard B; Helenius, Ari; Hiscox, Julian A; Teesalu, Tambet; Matthews, David A; Davidson, Andrew D; Collins, Brett M; Cullen, Peter J; Yamauchi, Yohei",Science,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abd3072; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33082294/,359

Our study aims to investigate the 30-day mortality rate of hip fracture patients during the first 30 days of the pandemic in the United Kingdom. METHODS A single-center, observational, prospective study of patients presenting with hip fractures. Data collection started from ""day 0"" of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom and continued for 30 days. We collected data on time to surgery, Clinical Frailty Scale score, Nottingham Hip Fracture Score, COVID-19 infection status, 30-day mortality, and cause of death. For comparison, we collected retrospective data during the same 30-day period in 2018, 2019, and the previous 6 months (Control groups A, B, and C, respectively). RESULTS Forty-three patients were included in the study. There was no difference in age or gender between the Study and Control groups. The 30-day mortality rate of the Study group was 16.3%, which was higher than Control groups A (P = 0.022), B (P = 0.003) and C (P = 0.001). The prevalence of COVID-19 infection in our Study group was 26%. Of the 7 mortalities recorded, 4 patients tested positive for COVID-19 infection. In our Study group, COVID-19 infection correlated significantly with 30-day mortality (P = 0.002, odds ratio 2.4). CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated a significant increase in 30-day mortality among hip fracture patients during the first 30 days of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. A positive COVID-19 test result in patients with hip fractures is associated with a 2.4-fold increase in risk of 30-day mortality. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE Prognostic Level II.

94395,Effectiveness of Integrative Medicine in COVID-19?,2020-06-01,"Recent work has found that an individual's beliefs and personal characteristics can impact perceptions of and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain individuals-such as those who are politically conservative or who endorse conspiracy theories-are less likely to engage in preventative behaviors like social distancing. The current research aims to address whether these individual differences not only affect people's reactions to the pandemic, but also their actual likelihood of contracting COVID-19. In the early months of the pandemic, U.S. participants responded to a variety of individual difference measures as well as questions specific to the pandemic itself. Four months later, 2120 of these participants responded with whether they had contracted COVID-19. Nearly all of our included individual difference measures significantly predicted whether a person reported testing positive for the virus in this four-month period. Additional analyses revealed that all of these relationships were primarily mediated by whether participants held accurate knowledge about COVID-19. These findings offer useful insights for developing more effective interventions aimed at slowing the spread of both COVID-19 and future diseases. Moreover, some findings offer critical tests of the validity of such theoretical frameworks as those concerning conspiratorial ideation and disgust sensitivity within a real-world context.","Moore, Courtney A; Ruisch, Benjamin C; Granados Samayoa, Javier A; Boggs, Shelby T; Ladanyi, Jesse T; Fazio, Russell H",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-99981-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34650222/,359

Prior to intervention activities, we recruited students to complete a survey about their MenB knowledge and attitudes. For survey participants who provided contact information, we sent two follow-up surveys and assessed MenB vaccine records. We used chi-square tests, adjusted for nonindependence, to compare preintervention to postintervention (three-month and one-year) vaccination and attitudes.Results: Among the 686 students with accessible vaccine records, MenB vaccine initiation increased 9% (from 24% to 33%) and completion increased 8% (from 13% to 21%) from before the intervention to one year after the intervention. When restricting to students who completed the relevant follow-up surveys, the percentage of students who heard of the MenB vaccine increased by 15% (p > .001) from before the intervention to three months after (n = 188 students) and maintained a 10% increase (p > .001) one year after the intervention (n = 261 students). Among students that heard of the MenB vaccine, the percentage of students who thought they needed the MenB vaccine even though they received the MenACWY increased 14% (p = .03) by the three-month postintervention survey and up to 18% by the one-year follow-up (p = .002).Conclusions: A university-wide, on-campus vaccination and educational campaign increased college students' MenB vaccine initiation, completion, and knowledge.Clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT02975596.","Richardson, Eric; Ryan, Kathleen A; Lawrence, Robert M; Harle, Christopher A; Desai, Shivani M; Livingston, Melvin D; Rawal, Amit; Staras, Stephanie A S",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1923347; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34076556/,359

We sought to investigate whether there might be an interaction between white blood cell (WBC) count and bivalirudin for the risk of mortality, and whether this interaction is independent of major bleeding. METHODS AND RESULTS Among the 3602 patients enrolled in the HORIZONS-AMI trial, WBC count was available in 3433 (95.3%) patients. Patients were stratified according to WBC tertiles. At 1-year follow-up, bivalirudin was associated with significantly lower rates of mortality and cardiac mortality compared with unfractionated heparin plus glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors in patients in the upper WBC tertile (all-cause death: 4.1% versus 9.3%, respectively; P=0.0004; cardiac death: 2.0% versus 6.9%; respectively; P<0.0001) but not in patients in the mid-WBC or lower WBC tertiles. The reduction of mortality with bivalirudin across WBC tertiles was independent of major bleeding, and a significant interaction was apparent for 1-year all-cause mortality and cardiac mortality between WBC and bivalirudin therapy. Similar findings were apparent at 3 years. CONCLUSIONS In patients with ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction, a significant interaction between bivalirudin therapy and admission WBC count was apparent for 1-year mortality. The reduction in mortality was independent of major bleeding, suggesting that other mechanisms may be implicated in the survival benefit observed with bivalirudin.

Among the enzymes that are involved in the ubiquitin (Ub) signaling cascade, tremendous efforts have been focused on elucidating the roles of E3 Ub ligases as they determine the complexity and specificity of ubiquitination. Not surprisingly, the malfunction of E3 ligases is directly implicated in many human diseases, including cancer. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop potent and specific molecules to modulate E3 ligase activity as intracellular probes for target validation and as pharmacological agents in pre-clinical research. Unfortunately, the progress has been hampered by the dynamic regulation mechanisms for different types of E3 ligases. Here, we summarize the progress of using protein engineering to develop Ub variant (UbV) inhibitors for all major families of E3 ligases and UbV activators for HECT E3s and homodimeric RING E3s. We believe that this provides a general strategy and a valuable toolkit for the research community to inhibit or activate E3 ligases and these synthetic molecules have important implications in exploring protein degradation for drug discovery.","LeBlanc, Nicole; Mallette, Evan; Zhang, Wei",The FEBS journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.15536; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32867007/,359

Patients and methods Between September 2015 and June 2017, a total of 21 male athletes (mean age 22.6 years; range, 20 to 30 years) were included in this study. All participants were randomly divided into two groups as dynamic stretching group (n=11) and control group (n=10). The participants in the dynamic stretching group performed stretching exercises for the ankle evertor and dorsiflexor muscles five days a week for six weeks. Peroneal and tibial muscle reaction properties were evaluated at baseline (two times for acute effect) and at the end of the intervention. Electromyographic activity parameters including reaction time, reaction duration, and reaction magnitude of the muscles were measured using an ankle supination tilting platform. There were four different supination conditions: (i) ankle neutral, 15° inversion (0015), (ii) ankle neutral, 30° inversion (0030), (iii) ankle 20° plantarflexion, 15° inversion (2015), and (iv) ankle 20° plantarflexion, 30° inversion (2030). Results There were no significant differences in acute and chronic effects of dynamic stretching exercises for peroneal and tibial muscle reaction time, reaction duration, and muscle activity in four positions on the ankle inversion simulation platform (p>0.05). Conclusion Our study results suggest that dynamic stretching exercises have no positive or negative effects on muscle reaction properties and on the possible risk of ankle sprain during sudden ankle inversion.

Given the important role the risk perception has in influencing both the behaviors and psychological well-being, it appears useful exploring this factor in this segment of the population. Despite different studies already described the factors influencing the risk perception, few focused on older adults. For this reason, we investigated risk perception in 514 people over 60 years during the lockdown. We administered a structured interview collecting socio-demographic information, sources of information used, actions undertaken to avoid contagion, and risk perception. Risk perception related to COVID-19 was significantly lower than the perceived risk associated with other threats, and it was correlated to the number of sources of information used but not to the actions undertaken. Furthermore, we found higher risk perception in who knew infected persons, and a negative correlation between the risk perception and age, with the over 75 perceiving a lower risk of getting infected compared to the younger participants. Our results should be taken as informative for future studies. Indeed, further studies on the older adults and the risk perception during emergencies are needed to better orient both communication and supporting strategies.","Guastafierro, Erika; Toppo, Claudia; Magnani, Francesca G; Romano, Rosa; Facchini, Carla; Campioni, Rino; Brambilla, Ersilia; Leonardi, Matilde",Journal of gerontological social work,https://doi.org/10.1080/01634372.2020.1870606; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33393447/,359
102487,Recommended Management of Temporomandibular Joint Dislocation During the COVID-19 Outbreak.,2020,"BACKGROUND Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) is currently of major research interest as it may offer significant clinical potential for endoscopic procedures in the future. Nevertheless, many issues are still unresolved. The aim of this study is a systematic review of the literature to evaluate techniques and technologies to address the issue of achieving a secure gastric wall defect closure. METHODS Studies were identified by searching MEDLINE, EMBASE, Current Contents, Cochrane Library, Entrez PubMed and Clinical Trials Database until December 2008. We divided the different technologies into four groups: clipping, stitching, stapling and occluding systems. We analysed the different technologies in terms of (1) simplicity of manoeuvring for port closure, (2) security of introduction, (3) permanent implantation of the device into the organ, (4) effectiveness of port closure and (5) availability on the market. RESULTS Twenty-eight published studies were identified, while nine clinical trials are ongoing. Among proposed technologies, staplers and occluders have greater effectiveness but lack of security, and in the case of staplers also lack of simplicity of use. None of the stitching technologies can really be considered effective except for the Flexible Endostitch, which on the other side is difficult to handle in the current fashion. Standard clips, although easy to handle, have never been proved to be reliable, as only mucosal layer closure has been demonstrated to date. On the other side, the over-the-scope clip is likely to be effective, secure to introduce and simple to handle within the hollow organ. CONCLUSIONS Achieving reliable closure of the hollow organ defect represents the first step towards implementation of clinical NOTES. The current data do not yet allow definitive and clear advantages or disadvantages of the different options to be determined. The introduction of the EURONOTES registry will help us to understand in which direction to proceed.","Arezzo, Alberto; Morino, Mario",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-009-0593-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19565295/,359

It starts with the premise that the precursors of catastrophes of this magnitude provide a valid basis for planning corrective measures, improved preparedness, and ultimately serious health reform. Such reform should include standardized protocols for proper deployment of telemedicine to triage patients to the appropriate level and source of care at the point of need, proper use of relevant technological innovations to deliver precision medicine, and the development of regional networks to coordinate and improve access to care while streamlining the care process. The other essential element is a universal payment system that puts the United States at par with the rest of the industrialized countries, regardless of variation among them. The ultimate goal is creating an efficient, effective, accessible, and equitable system of care. Although timing is uncertain, the pandemic will be brought under control.

The neurovascular replicator (Vascular Simulations, Stony Brook, New York, USA) creates a physical environment that replicates patient-specific neurovascular anatomy and hemodynamic physiology, and allows devices to be implanted under fluoroscopic guidance. OBJECTIVE To report the results of a unique neurovascular replicator-based training program, which was incorporated into the WEB-IT study to optimize technical performance and patient safety. METHODS US investigators participated in a new training program that incorporated full surgical rehearsals on a neurovascular replicator. No roll-in cases were permitted within the trial. Custom replicas of patient-specific neurovascular anatomy were created for the initial cases treated at each center, as well as for cases expected to be challenging. On-site surgical rehearsals were performed before these procedures. RESULTS A total of 48 participating investigators at 25 US centers trained using the replicator. Sessions included centralized introductory training, on-site training, and patient-specific full surgical rehearsal. Fluoroscopy and procedure times in the WEB-IT study were not significantly different from those seen in two European trials where participating physicians had significant WEB procedure experience before study initiation. CONCLUSIONS A new program of neurovascular-replicator-based physician training was employed within the WEB-IT study. This represents a new methodology for education and training that may be an effective means to optimize technical success and patient safety during the introduction of a new technology.","Arthur, Adam; Hoit, Daniel; Coon, Alexander; Delgado Almandoz, Josser E; Elijovich, Lucas; Cekirge, Saruhan; Fiorella, David",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2017-013310; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28814528/,359

103858,The patient's perspective of remote respiratory assessments during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-06-07,"BACKGROUND The management of unruptured brain arteriovenous malformation (AVM) patients remains controversial. Furthermore, curative attempts to treat ruptured AVM patients have not been questioned so far, and there is a lack of prospective data on clinical results according to treatment modality. Endovascular treatment is often used aiming to improve the safety or efficacy of surgery or radiation therapy, but benefits have never been documented in a trial. A care trial context is needed to evaluate interventions at the same time they are practised. METHODS/TRIAL DESIGN TOBAS is a pragmatic, prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial and registry which offers a care trial context for brain AVM patients, including surgical resection, radiosurgery or endovascular embolization, alone or combined. The study includes two RCTs and a multimodality prospective registry. The objectives of the proposed study are to assess whether preventive interventions (surgery, embolization, radiation therapy, alone or combined), selected by the local treatment team and performed as locally practiced, randomly allocated and compared with conservative management, in unruptured brain AVM patients eligible for active or conservative management, can improve the proportion of patients having an independent outcome (modified Rankin Scale (mRS) < 3, as assessed by a standardized questionnaire administered by non-masked care personnel) at 10 years. All patients judged ineligible for randomized allocation are to be entered in a multimodal registry. The objective of a nested trial in patients with ruptured or unruptured AVMs to be treated by surgery or radiation therapy, is to assess whether pre-surgical or pre-radiation embolization, randomly allocated and compared with no embolization, can improve the proportion of patients with complete eradication of the AVM, as locally adjudicated, combined with a good clinical outcome (mRS < 3). The study will require up to 2000 patients in approximately 30 centers or more, followed for 10 years. TOBAS is registered at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT02098252 as of 25 March 2014.","Darsaut, Tim E; Magro, Elsa; Gentric, Jean-Christophe; Batista, André Lima; Chaalala, Chiraz; Roberge, David; Bojanowski, Michel W; Weill, Alain; Roy, Daniel; Raymond, Jean",Trials,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13063-015-1019-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26530856/,359
104293,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical trials with drugs.,2020-09-24,"Pneumonia remains a major cause of childhood mortality and morbidity globally. Accurate diagnosis and attribution of the causes of pneumonia are important for measuring the burden of disease, implementing appropriate preventive or treatment strategies, and developing more effective interventions. This review summarizes recent diagnostic advances in radiological techniques, specimen collection, and laboratory methods. Although chest ultrasound and chest magnetic resonance imaging are promising modalities for radiological diagnosis, their role in clinical management and their impact on outcomes need further study. Rapid, highly sensitive, multiplex laboratory tests performed on upper respiratory tract samples or induced sputum can detect nucleic acid from potential pathogens in most children with pneumonia. However, it may be difficult to attribute causality because it is often impossible to distinguish between organisms colonizing or infecting the upper respiratory tract and those causing pneumonia. Currently available host biomarkers lack accuracy for distinguishing bacterial or mixed bacterial-viral infections from viral infections. New biomarkers derived from host transcriptional profile analysis may be more accurate but require validation. Prospective studies with appropriate control populations, including studies of clinical impact, are needed to improve our understanding of the role of tests. Although progress has been made in radiological techniques and laboratory testing, current methods for diagnosing and attributing the causes of pneumonia are suboptimal.","Zar, Heather J; Andronikou, Savvas; Nicol, Mark P",BMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.j2739; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28747379/,359

COVID-19 accelerated the adoption of telehealth across many medical specialties. The purpose of this study was to examine telehealth utilization and satisfaction among pediatric physiatrists. METHODS Using Google Forms, a voluntary survey was created and administered to pediatric physiatrists. The survey collected information on practice setting, telehealth utilization, provider satisfaction, perceived satisfaction of patients and families, and the anticipated role of telehealth in pediatric rehabilitation going forward. RESULTS Seventy-eight respondents completed the survey. There was a significant reported increase in telehealth utilization since COVID-19 from 14.5% to 97.4%. Eighty-two percent of participants reported feeling comfortable utilizing telehealth, 77% felt confident in the quality of the care provided, and 91% believed patients were satisfied with telehealth visits. Responses indicate that telehealth is expected to play a role in future pediatric physiatry and interest in telehealth continuing medical education is prevalent. Most pediatric physiatrists plan to continue or expand telehealth offerings after COVID-19. CONCLUSION Telehealth adoption has been expedited by COVID-19. Physician interest in and satisfaction with telehealth is high.

105080,Neuropsychological and Functional Impact of COVID-19 on Mild Cognitive Impairment.,2020,"Maternal immune activation increases the risk of neurodevelopmental disorders. Elevated cytokines, such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ), in offspring's brains play a central role. IFN-γ activates an antiviral cellular state, limiting viral entry and replication. Moreover, IFN-γ is implicated in brain development. We tested the hypothesis that IFN-γ signaling contributes to molecular and cellular phenotypes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders. Transient IFN-γ treatment of neural progenitors derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells increased neurite outgrowth. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that major histocompatibility complex class I (MHCI) genes were persistently up-regulated through neuronal differentiation-an effect that was mediated by IFN-γ-induced promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML) nuclear bodies. Critically, IFN-γ-induced neurite outgrowth required both PML and MHCI. We also found evidence that IFN-γ disproportionately altered the expression of genes associated with schizophrenia and autism, suggesting convergence between genetic and environmental risk factors. Together, these data implicate IFN-γ signaling in neurodevelopmental disorder etiology.","Warre-Cornish, Katherine; Perfect, Leo; Nagy, Roland; Duarte, Rodrigo R R; Reid, Matthew J; Raval, Pooja; Mueller, Annett; Evans, Amanda L; Couch, Amalie; Ghevaert, Cédric; McAlonan, Grainne; Loth, Eva; Murphy, Declan; Powell, Timothy R; Vernon, Anthony C; Srivastava, Deepak P; Price, Jack",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aay9506; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32875100/,359
106093,Urticaria and COVID-19: a review.,2020-09-09,"AIMS We describe the first-in-human experience with a novel cerebral embolic protection device used during transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). One current challenge of TAVI is the reduction of procedural stroke. Procedural mobilisation of debris is a known source of cerebral embolisation. Mechanical protection by transient filtration of cerebral blood flow might reduce the embolic burden during TAVI. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of the Claret CE Pro™ cerebral protection device in patients undergoing TAVI. METHODS AND RESULTS Patients scheduled for TAVI were prospectively enrolled at three centres. The Claret CE Pro™ (Claret Medical, Inc. Santa Rosa, CA, USA) cerebral protection device was placed via the right radial/brachial artery prior to TAVI and was removed after the procedure. The primary endpoint was technical success rate. Secondary endpoints encompassed procedural and 30-day stroke rates, as well as device-related complications. Deployment of the Claret CE Pro™ cerebral protection device was intended for use in 40 patients, 35 devices were implanted into the aortic arch. Technical success rate with delivery of the proximal and distal filter was 60% for the first generation device and 87% for the second-generation device. Delivery times for the first-generation device were 12.4±12.1 minutes and 4.4 ± 2.5 minutes for the second-generation device (p<0.05). The quantity of contrast used related to the Claret CE Pro System was 19.6 ± 3.8 ml. Captured debris was documented in at least 19 of 35 implanted devices (54.3%). No procedural transient ischaemic attacks, minor strokes or major strokes occurred. Thirty-day follow-up showed one minor stroke occurring 30 days after the procedure, and two major strokes both occurring well after the patient had completed TAVI. CONCLUSIONS The use of the Claret CE Pro™ system is feasible and safe. Capture of debris in more than half of the patients provides evidence for the potential to reduce the procedural cerebral embolic burden utilising this dedicated filter system during TAVI.","Naber, Christoph K; Ghanem, Alexander; Abizaid, Alexander A; Wolf, Alexander; Sinning, Jan-Malte; Werner, Nikos; Nickenig, Georg; Schmitz, Thomas; Grube, Eberhard",EuroIntervention : journal of EuroPCR in collaboration with the Working Group on Interventional Cardiology of the European Society of Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.4244/eijv8i1a8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22403768/,359
106692,Feeding Low-Income Children during the Covid-19 Pandemic.,2020-03-30,"Intraoperative manipulation causes circulating tumor cell (CTC) shedding into the blood and accelerates metastasis in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The present study was conducted to assess the degree of dissemination resulting from surgery and to explore the biological features of CTCs. In patients with NSCLC who underwent complete resection, the pulmonary vein (PV) was isolated and stapled following thoracotomy. The number of CTCs retained per 7.5 ml PV blood (CTC-PV) and peripheral blood were detected. Following hematopoietic cell depletion, a xenograft assay was performed using the CTC-PV. A total of 32 consecutive patients were enrolled in the study, the majority of whom had CTCs in their PV blood (n=29, 90.6%). Circulating tumor microemboli (CTM) were identified in 12 patients (37.5%). The CTC-PV and CTM-PV counts were positively correlated with tumor size (P=0.012 and P=0.028, respectively). Patients with small tumors (<3.0 cm) also had considerable CTC-PV and CTM-PV. A total of 8 patients received platinum-based chemotherapy prior to surgery. The CTC-PV and CTM-PV counts in patients with partial response were significantly lower than those in patients with stable disease or who did not receive induction therapy (P=0.025 and P=0.044, respectively). The enriched CTC-PV from 3 patients were injected into 3 immunodeficient mice, and 1 mouse developed a xenograft tumor. To conclude, the present study indicates that intraoperative manipulation contributes to the hematogenous dissemination of tumorigenic CTCs and CTM. Lobectomy is recommended for lung cancer of any tumor size and stage according to oncological principles, in addition to ligating the PV, if possible, prior to any other treatment.","Lv, Chao; Zhao, Bingtian; Wang, Limin; Zhang, Panpan; Ma, Yuanyuan; Wang, Yuzhao; Wu, Nan; Wu, Ying; Yang, Yue",Oncology letters,https://doi.org/10.3892/ol.2017.7405; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29422972/,359
107259,Microcystic corneal oedema associated with over-wear of decentred orthokeratology lenses during COVID-19 lockdown.,2021-03-16,"BACKGROUND Pupillometry monitoring under general anesthesia is based on the assumption that pupillary diameter variations reflect the adequacy of the provided analgesia to the intensity of the nociceptive surgical stimulus. The accurate interpretation of pupillometric data requires establishing clearly what the expected baseline unstimulated pupillary diameter at each specific level of hypnosis is. Opioids decrease pupillary diameter in a dose-dependent fashion. In contrast, the effects of hypnotic drugs on pupillary diameter are not well known. Our aim was to describe the potential relationship between propofol predicted effect-site concentrations (Cets) ranging from 1 to 3 µg/mL and pupillary diameter. METHODS Patients were randomized to receive propofol by target-controlled infusion at a predicted Cet of 1, 2, or 3 µg/mL (groups P1, P2, and P3, respectively). Pupillary diameter measurements were performed after 10 minutes of steady-state propofol infusion at the randomized Cet. No stimulation was performed during the study. Heart rate and bispectral index (BIS) were continuously recorded. RESULTS Forty patients were included: (13, 14, and 13 in groups P1, P2, and P3, respectively). Mean pupillary diameter was 5.7 mm (1 mm) in group P1, 4.8 mm (1.3 mm) in group P2, and 3.3 mm (0.8 mm) in group P3. Propofol had a dose-dependent effect on pupillary diameter (linear regression R = 0.45, P < .001). Pupillary diameter was positively correlated with the BIS (Spearman r = 0.75 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.54 to -0.87] P < .001). CONCLUSIONS From 1 to 3 µg/mL of predicted Cet, propofol has a dose-dependent effect on pupillary diameter. Within this concentrations range, there is a positive correlation between BIS and pupillary diameter. The subcortical effect of propofol on pupillary diameter is correlated to its effect on the cortex. Studies assessing pupillary diameter as a marker of the nociception-antinociception balance should be performed in patients with a standardized depth of hypnosis.","Sabourdin, Nada; Meniolle, Fleur; Chemam, Sarah; Rigouzzo, Agnes; Hamza, Jamil; Louvet, Nicolas; Constant, Isabelle",Anesthesia and analgesia,https://doi.org/10.1213/ane.0000000000004362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31490817/,359

Our aim was to study cortical venous filling (CVF) in a time-resolved manner with dynamic computed tomographic angiography and to assess the relationship with clinical outcome. METHODS Patients with a proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion underwent noncontrast CT and whole-brain CT perfusion/dynamic CT angiography within 9 hours after stroke-onset. We defined poor outcome as a modified Rankin Scale score of ≥3. Association between the extent and velocity of CVF and poor outcome at 3 months was analyzed with Poisson-regression. Prognostic value of optimal CVF (maximum opacification of cortical veins) in addition to age, stroke severity, treatment, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score, cerebral blood flow, and collateral status was assessed with logistic regression and summarized with the area under the curve. RESULTS Eighty-eight patients were included, with a mean age of 67 years. By combining the extent and velocity of optimal CVF, we observed a decreased risk of poor outcome in patients with good and fast optimal CVF, risk ratio of 0.5 (95% confidence interval, 0.3-0.7). Extent and velocity of optimal CVF had additional prognostic value (area under the curve, 0.88; 95% confidence interval, 0.77-0.98; P<0.02) compared with a model without CVF information. CONCLUSIONS The combination of extent and velocity of optimal CVF, as assessed with dynamic CT angiography, is useful to identify patients with acute middle cerebral artery stroke at higher risk of poor clinical outcome at 3-month follow-up.

This study assessed outcomes in patients who underwent robotic MRND through BABA using the da Vinci Xi system. Methods The medical records of 40 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy, bilateral central neck dissection and MRND from September 2018 to March 2020 were reviewed retrospectively, including 12 who underwent robotic surgery and 28 who underwent open surgery. All operations were performed by a single endocrine surgeon. Results Operation time was significantly longer in the robotic than in the open group (277.08 ± 32.64 versus 191.43 ± 60.43 minutes, respectively, p < 0.01), but the number of retrieved lymph nodes did not differ (32.58 ±9.31 versus 34.54 ±10.90, respectively, p = 0.569). The incidence of transient hypoparathyroidism was significantly lower in the robotic group (16.7% [2/12] versus 53.6% [15/28], p = 0.041). Hospital stay was shorter (3.92 ±0.90 versus 4.71 ±1.63 days) and pain score on the first postoperative day was lower (2.92 ±0.29 versus 3.18 ±0.67) in the robotic group. Six (50%) of the 12 patients in the robotic group had stimulated thyroglobulin levels <1.0 ng/mL. Conclusions Robotic MRND through BABA has several advantages, including excellent cosmetic outcomes and a lower incidence of transient hypoparathyroidism than open MRND.

108255,[COVID-19 and vaccination: a global disruption].,2020-11-01,"BACKGROUND Vitamin D deficiency compromises muscle function and is related to the etiology of several clinical conditions that can contribute to the development of disability. However, there are few epidemiological studies investigating the association between vitamin D deficiency and the incidence of disability. OBJECTIVES We aimed to assess whether vitamin D deficiency is associated with the incidence of disability in basic activities of daily living (BADL) and to verify whether there are sex differences in this association. METHODS A 4-y follow-up study was conducted involving individuals aged 50 y or older who participated in ELSA (English Longitudinal Study of Ageing). The sample consisted of 4814 participants free of disability at baseline according to the modified Katz Index. Vitamin D was assessed by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations and the participants were classified as sufficient (>50 nmol/L), insufficient (>30 to ≤50 nmol/L), or deficient (≤30 nmol/L). Sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics were also investigated. BADL were re-evaluated after 2 and 4 y of follow-up. The report of any difficulty to perform ≥1 BADL was considered as an incident case of disability. Poisson models stratified by sex and controlled for sociodemographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics were carried out. RESULTS After 4-y follow-up, deficient serum 25(OH)D was a risk factor for the incidence of BADL disability in both women (IRR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.16, 2.03) and men (IRR: 1.44; 95% CI: 1.02, 2.02). However, insufficient serum 25(OH)D was not a risk factor for the incidence of BADL disability in either men or women. CONCLUSIONS Independently of sex, deficient serum 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with increased risk of incidence of BADL disability in adults >50 y old and should be an additional target of clinical strategies to prevent disability in these populations.","Luiz, Mariane M; Máximo, Roberta; Oliveira, Dayane C; Ramírez, Paula C; de Souza, Aline F; Delinocente, Maicon L B; Steptoe, Andrew; de Oliveira, Cesar; Alexandre, Tiago",The Journal of nutrition,https://doi.org/10.1093/jn/nxaa258; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937653/,359

Ironically, despite the fact that a majority of adults in developed nations are overweight or obese, society stigmatizes the obese severely. Still, obese people have more than just social motivations for losing weight; obesity commonly goes hand in hand with life-threatening comorbidities like cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes and some forms of cancer. It severely threatens quality of life, limiting the ability to move and work, navigate public places, and provide care for others and is a factor in musculoskeletal disorders like osteoarthritis. Both obesity and its comorbidities lead obese patients to hospitals at greater rates than patients of normal weight, and these factors, along with social pressures, motivate patients and their physicians to pursue solutions for obesity, its comorbidities, or both.","Rutherford, Jesse Jayne",IEEE engineering in medicine and biology magazine : the quarterly magazine of the Engineering in Medicine & Biology Society,https://doi.org/10.1109/memb.2009.935469; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20176518/,359
109213,Obesity and COVID-19: The Two Sides of the Coin.,2020-07-13,"BACKGROUND Nebulised antibiotics are frequently used for the prevention or treatment of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Many factors may influence pulmonary drug concentrations with inaccurate dosing schedules potentially leading to therapeutic failure and/or the emergence of antibiotic resistance. We describe a research pathway for studying the pharmacokinetics of a nebulised antibiotic during mechanical ventilation using in vitro methods and ovine models, using tobramycin as the study antibiotic. METHODS In vitro studies using a laser diffractometer and a bacterial-viral filter were used to measure the effect of the type and size of tracheal tubes and antibiotic concentration on the particle size distribution of the tobramycin 400 mg (4 ml; 100 mg/ml) and 160 mg (4 ml, 40 mg/ml) aerosol and nebulised mass delivered. To compare the regional drug distribution in the lung of two routes (intravenous and nebulised) of drug administration of tobramycin 400 mg, technetium-99m-labelled tobramycin 400 mg with planar nuclear medicine imaging was used in a mechanically ventilated ovine model. To measure tobramycin concentrations by intravenous and nebulised tobramycin 400 mg (4 ml, 100 mg/ml) administration in the lung interstitial space (ISF) fluid and blood of mechanically ventilated sheep, the microdialysis technique was used over an 8-h duration. RESULTS Tobramycin 100 mg/ml achieved a higher lung dose (121.3 mg) compared to 40 mg/ml (41.3 mg) solution. The imaging study with labelled tobramycin indicated that nebulised tobramycin distributed more extensively into each lung zone of the mechanically ventilated sheep than intravenous administration. A higher lung ISF peak concentration of tobramycin was observed with nebulised tobramycin (40.8 mg/l) compared to intravenous route (19.0 mg/l). CONCLUSIONS The research methods appear promising to describe lung pharmacokinetics for formulations intended for nebulisation during mechanical ventilation. These methods need further validation in an experimental pneumonia model to be able to contribute toward optimising dosing regimens to inform clinical trials and/or clinical use.","Dhanani, Jayesh A; Cohen, Jeremy; Parker, Suzanne L; Chan, Hak-Kim; Tang, Patricia; Ahern, Benjamin J; Khan, Adeel; Bhatt, Manoj; Goodman, Steven; Diab, Sara; Chaudhary, Jivesh; Lipman, Jeffrey; Wallis, Steven C; Barnett, Adrian; Chew, Michelle; Fraser, John F; Roberts, Jason A",Intensive care medicine experimental,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40635-018-0180-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29998357/,359

110059,T Cell Phenotyping in Individuals Hospitalized with COVID-19.,2021-02-08,"UNLABELLED Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is a major global health issue. The role of rare genetic variants in CHB has not been elucidated. We aimed to identify rare allelic variants predisposing to CHB. We performed exome sequencing in 50 CHB patients who had no identifiable risk factors for CHB and 40 controls who were healthy and hepatitis B surface antibody-positive, but had never received hepatitis B vaccination. We selected six rare variant alleles and followed up their association with disease status by Sanger sequencing in a case-control study comprising 1,728 CHB patients and 1,636 healthy controls. The latter had either not been immunized with hepatitis B vaccine or had uncertain vaccination status. Our results showed that transmembrane protein 2 p.Ser1254Asn, interferon alpha 2 p.Ala120Thr, its regulator NLR family member X1 p.Arg707Cys, and complement component 2 p.Glu318Asp were associated with CHB, with P values of <1.0 × 10(-7) , 2.76 × 10(-5) , 5.08 × 10(-5) , 2.78 × 10(-4) and odds ratios (ORs) of 2.45, 4.08, 2.34, and 1.97, respectively. The combined P value was <2.0 × 10(-16) . As there has been no indication of immunological functions for the associated gene, transmembrane protein 2, we further studied its expression by immunohistochemistry, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and western blotting. Our results showed that it was strongly expressed by healthy hepatocytes, but its expression was reduced in liver tissues with CHB, hepatitis B viral (HBV) genome-containing HepG2.2.15 cells, as compared with healthy liver tissues and non-HBV genome-containing HepG2 cells (P = 0.022 and 0.0036, respectively). CONCLUSION We identified four missense mutations associated with CHB, our results providing evidence for rare inborn genetic defects that contribute to increased host susceptibility to CHB.","Zhao, Qiang; Peng, Liang; Huang, Weijun; Li, Qibin; Pei, Yuanyuan; Yuan, Ping; Zheng, Lingyan; Zhang, Yongling; Deng, Jia; Zhong, Cheng; Hu, Bin; Ding, Hongke; Fang, Wei; Li, Ru; Liao, Qijun; Lin, Chaoshuang; Deng, Weiping; Yan, Huijun; Hou, Jinghui; Wu, Qiuliang; Xu, Tingting; Liu, Jinsong; Hu, Longbo; Peng, Tao; Chen, Suqing; Lai, Kar N; Yuen, Man-Fung; Wang, Yue; Maini, Mala K; Li, Caixia; Li, Miaoxin; Wang, Jian; Zhang, Xiuqing; Sham, Pak-Chung; Wang, Jun; Gao, Zhi-Liang; Wang, Yiming",Hepatology,https://doi.org/10.1002/hep.25850; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22610944/,359

However, prospective assessment of substance use disorders (SUD) after bariatric surgery is limited. OBJECTIVE To report SUD-related outcomes after RYGB and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). To identify factors associated with incident SUD-related outcomes. SETTING 10 U.S. hospitals METHODS: The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 is a prospective cohort study. Participants self-reported past-year AUD symptoms (determined by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test), illicit drug use (cocaine, hallucinogens, inhalants, phencyclidine, amphetamines, or marijuana), and SUD treatment (counseling or hospitalization for alcohol or drugs) presurgery and annually postsurgery for up to 7 years through January 2015. RESULTS Of 2348 participants who underwent RYGB or LAGB, 2003 completed baseline and follow-up assessments (79.2% women, baseline median age: 47 years, median body mass index 45.6). The year-5 cumulative incidence of postsurgery onset AUD symptoms, illicit drug use, and SUD treatment were 20.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 18.5-23.3), 7.5% (95% CI: 6.1-9.1), and 3.5% (95% CI: 2.6-4.8), respectively, post-RYGB, and 11.3% (95% CI: 8.5-14.9), 4.9% (95% CI: 3.1-7.6), and .9% (95% CI: .4-2.5) post-LAGB. Undergoing RYGB versus LAGB was associated with higher risk of incident AUD symptoms (adjusted hazard ratio or AHR = 2.08 [95% CI: 1.51-2.85]), illicit drug use (AHR = 1.76 [95% CI: 1.07-2.90]) and SUD treatment (AHR = 3.56 [95% CI: 1.26-10.07]). CONCLUSIONS Undergoing RYGB versus LAGB was associated with twice the risk of incident AUD symptoms. One-fifth of participants reported incident AUD symptoms within 5 years post-RYGB. AUD education, screening, evaluation, and treatment referral should be incorporated in pre- and postoperative care.","King, Wendy C; Chen, Jia-Yuh; Courcoulas, Anita P; Dakin, Gregory F; Engel, Scott G; Flum, David R; Hinojosa, Marcelo W; Kalarchian, Melissa A; Mattar, Samer G; Mitchell, James E; Pomp, Alfons; Pories, Walter J; Steffen, Kristine J; White, Gretchen E; Wolfe, Bruce M; Yanovski, Susan Z",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2017.03.021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28528115/,359

Here we clarify the safe handling of an aberrant artery using a clinical review and an experimental model. METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who underwent lobectomy for pulmonary sequestration with aberrant arteries at the Nippon Medical School between January 2008 and December 2010. This was supplemented by an experimental pressure test using vessels obtained from pigs. RESULTS We identified four patients with aberrant arteries that were successfully occluded via either stapling. In the experimental model, we divided pig vessels into small-diameter (S) and large-diameter (L) groups. The 1.0-mm-high staples were stronger in the S group than in the L group (p = 0.028). In the L group, the 2.0-mm-high staples were stronger than the 1.0-mm staples (p = 0.015). Leakage from the staple line was associated with a poorer B-shape of inserted staples. CONCLUSIONS The techniques described in this report are useful in successful minimally invasive transection of an aberrant artery (other than very thin vessels) when resecting a pulmonary sequestration by stapler only. A detailed investigation should be performed to determine the most appropriate stapler or cartridge.","Okamoto, Junichi; Kubokura, Hirotoshi; Usuda, Jitsuo",BMC surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12893-015-0009-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25880643/,359
111571,Post-COVID-19 heart syndrome.,2021-03-01,"BACKGROUND Randomized controlled trials are considered the gold standard in evidence-based medicine. The authors conducted a systematic review to evaluate the quantity, quality, and trends of randomized controlled trials that assess surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome. METHODS The authors identified randomized controlled trials comparing two or more surgical interventions for carpal tunnel syndrome in PubMed, Cochrane, Scopus, Google Scholar, and Clinicaltrials.gov. Two independent reviewers evaluated articles for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed randomized controlled trial quality using the Jadad score. RESULTS Of 2253 identified studies, 58 met full inclusion criteria. They were published between 1985 and 2015, with a significant increase over time (p = 0.003). They were most frequently published in Journal of Hand Surgery (European Volume) [n = 15 (25.9 percent)]. Most randomized controlled trials were single-center studies [n = 54 (93.1 percent)] conducted in the United Kingdom [n = 13 (22.4 percent)] or the United States [n = 10 (17.2 percent)], with a mean study size of 80.1 ± 55.5 patients. Funding source was unknown in 62.1 percent (n = 36). Three-quarters [n = 44 (75.9 percent)] of randomized controlled trials did not define the primary outcome measure(s). Less than 30 percent (n = 17) of randomized controlled trials conducted a power analysis. Only four studies with patients reported lost to follow-up provided an explanation for each patient. Six randomized controlled trials (10.3 percent) conducted intention-to-treat analysis. The mean Jadad score was 2.14 ± 1.26, with no significant improvement over time (p = 0.245). CONCLUSIONS Despite the significant increase in the number of randomized controlled trials published studying surgical treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome over time, a mean Jadad score of 2.14 with no change over time indicates a need for improvement in quality. Proper study design is key to avoiding introduction of bias and ensuring the validity of conclusions drawn.","Long, Chao; Azad, Amee D; desJardins-Park, Heather E; Fox, Paige M",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/prs.0000000000005366; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30822284/,359

We review multiple hypotheses, including water activity, surface inactivation, and salt toxicity, that may account for the association between humidity and viability of viruses in aerosols. We assess the evidence and limitations for each hypothesis based on findings from virology, aerosol science, chemistry, and physics. In addition, we hypothesize that changes in pH within the aerosol that are induced by evaporation may trigger conformational changes of the surface glycoproteins of enveloped viruses and subsequently compromise their infectivity. This hypothesis may explain the differing responses of enveloped viruses to humidity. The precise mechanisms underlying the relationship remain largely unverified, and attaining a complete understanding of them will require an interdisciplinary approach.","Yang, Wan; Marr, Linsey C",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01658-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22820337/,359

However, little is known about the interrelationships between major respiratory viruses (and their species), host systemic metabolism, and disease pathobiology. METHODS In an ongoing multicenter prospective cohort study, we profiled the serum metabolome in 113 infants (63 RSV-only, 21 RV-A, and 29 RV-C) hospitalized with bronchiolitis. We identified serum metabolites that are most discriminatory in the RSV-RV-A and RSV-RV-C comparisons using sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis. We then investigated the association between discriminatory metabolites with acute and chronic outcomes. RESULTS In 113 infants with bronchiolitis, we measured 639 metabolites. Serum metabolome profiles differed in both comparisons (Ppermutation <0.05). In the RSV-RV-A comparison, we identified 30 discriminatory metabolites, predominantly in lipid metabolism pathways (e.g., sphingolipids and carnitines). In multivariable models, these metabolites were significantly associated with the risk of clinical outcomes (e.g., tricosanoyl sphingomyelin, OR for recurrent wheezing at age 3 years = 1.50; 95%CI 1.05-2.15). In the RSV-RV-C comparison, the discriminatory metabolites were also primarily involved in lipid metabolism (e.g., glycerophosphocholines [GPCs], 12,13-DiHome). These metabolites were also significantly associated with the risk of outcomes (e.g., 1-stearoyl-2-linoleoyl-GPC, OR for positive pressure ventilation use during hospitalization=0.47; 95%CI 0.28-0.78).

This is realized by regulating the length of polyadenine (polyA) linked to the DNA sequence and/or the hybridization of this sequence with the target DNA, and can be monitored by the Raman signal owing to the excellent performance of multibranched AuNPs (AuNSs) as a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrate and the distance change between the Raman reporter and the substrate. The probable mechanism, which depends on the repulsion of polyA from the sequence and the tip assembly, has also been probed through theoretical simulation using the finite difference time domain method. By virtue of this strategy, a conformation-transformation-based DNA@AuNS sensor is constructed for the identification of a specific oligonucleotide, which has been used for the detection of DNA sequences associated with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). This strategy leads to a novel sensing platform with good extendibility for DNA analysis, and provides a powerful protocol for facilitating the cognition of DNA conformation on metal surfaces.","Guo, Jingxing; Chen, Yunlong; Jiang, Yongjia; Ju, Huangxian",Chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.201700883; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28504862/,359

METHODS The ABC score from 2-hourly measurements of FEV1 was compared between workers with confirmed OA and asthmatics without occupational exposure to identify the optimum separation using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. Separate analyses were made for plots using clock time and time from waking to allow for use in shift workers. Minimum record criteria were ≥6 readings per day, >4 day shifts and >4 rest days (or >9 days for controls). RESULTS A retrospective analysis identified 22 workers with OA and 30 control asthmatics whose records reached the quality standards. Median FEV1 diurnal variation was 20.3% (IQR 16.1-32.6) for OA and 19.5% (IQR 14.5-26.1) for asthmatic controls. ROC curve analysis identified that a difference of 0.056 L/hour gave a ROC score of 0.821 for clock time and 0.768 for time from waking with a sensitivity of 73% and a specificity of 93% for the diagnosis of OA. CONCLUSIONS The diagnosis of OA requires objective confirmation. Unsupervised serial FEV1 measurements are more difficult to obtain reliably than measurements of peak expiratory flow, which are likely to remain the standard for general use. A FEV1 ABC score >0.056 L/hour provides a valid cut-off for those who wish to use FEV1 rather than peak expiratory flow.","Parkes, Edward D; Moore, Vicky C; Walters, Gareth I; Burge, Peter Sherwood",Occupational and environmental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1136/oemed-2019-106351; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764105/,359
115221,[Olfactory dysfunction and COVID-19 - current state of the problem].,2020,"UNLABELLED Rotaviruses and orbiviruses are nonturreted Reoviridae members. The rotavirus VP3 protein is a multifunctional capping enzyme and antagonist of the interferon-induced cellular oligoadenylate synthetase-RNase L pathway. Despite mediating important processes, VP3 is the sole protein component of the rotavirus virion whose structure remains unknown. In the current study, we used sequence alignment and homology modeling to identify features common to nonturreted Reoviridae capping enzymes and to predict the domain organization, structure, and active sites of rotavirus VP3. Our results suggest that orbivirus and rotavirus capping enzymes share a domain arrangement similar to that of the bluetongue virus capping enzyme. Sequence alignments revealed conserved motifs and suggested that rotavirus and orbivirus capping enzymes contain a variable N-terminal domain, a central guanine-N7-methyltransferase domain that contains an additional inserted domain, and a C-terminal guanylyltransferase and RNA 5'-triphosphatase domain. Sequence conservation and homology modeling suggested that the insertion in the guanine-N7-methyltransferase domain is a ribose-2'-O-methyltransferase domain for most rotavirus species. Our analyses permitted putative identification of rotavirus VP3 active-site residues, including those that form the ribose-2'-O-methyltransferase catalytic tetrad, interact with S-adenosyl-l-methionine, and contribute to autoguanylation. Previous reports have indicated that group A rotavirus VP3 contains a C-terminal 2H-phosphodiesterase domain that can cleave 2'-5' oligoadenylates, thereby preventing RNase L activation. Our results suggest that a C-terminal phosphodiesterase domain is present in the capping enzymes from two additional rotavirus species. Together, these findings provide insight into a poorly understood area of rotavirus biology and are a springboard for future biochemical and structural studies of VP3. IMPORTANCE Rotaviruses are an important cause of severe diarrheal disease. The rotavirus VP3 protein caps viral mRNAs and helps combat cellular innate antiviral defenses, but little is known about its structure or enzymatic mechanisms.

116929,COVID-19: A Strong Call for Remote Medicine In IBD.,2020-09-04,"BACKGROUND Embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS) has traditionally discounted the significance of internal carotid artery stenosis of <50%; however, recent studies have examined the role of carotid artery intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH) as an etiology in nonstenotic carotid arteries. We performed a systemic review of the literature to determine the prevalence of carotid artery IPH on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the vessel wall in patients with ESUS. METHODS We used PubMed, Epub ahead of print, Ovid MEDLINE in-process and other non-indexed citations, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Ovid Cochrane central register of controlled trials, Ovid Cochrane database of systematic reviews and Scopus. Our study consisted of all case series with >10 patients with IPH and ESUS published through October 2018. Additionally, we included 123 patients from an institutional database from 2015-2019. Random effects meta-analysis was used for pooling across studies. Meta-analysis results were expressed as odds ratio (OR) with respective 95% confidence intervals (CI). RESULTS A total of 7 studies with 354 patients were included. The mean age was 67.5 years old. The overall prevalence estimate for prevalence of IPH ipsilateral to the ischemic lesion was 25.8% (95% CI 13.1-38.5). The odds of having IPH on the ipsilateral side versus the contralateral side was 6.92 (95% CI 3.04-15.79). CONCLUSION Patients with ESUS have IPH in the carotid artery ipsilateral to the ischemic stroke in 25.8% of cases. Carotid artery vessel wall MRI should be considered as part of the standard work-up in patients with ESUS.","Mark, Ian T; Nasr, Deena M; Huston, John; de Maria, Lucio; de Sanctis, Paolo; Lehman, Vance T; Rabinstein, Alejandro A; Saba, Luca; Brinjikji, Waleed",Clinical neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00062-020-00921-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647922/,359

While evidence-based treatments for PTSD in young people already exist, there remains ongoing clinical and academic debate about the suitability of these approaches, particularly cognitive-behavioral approaches, for young people who have been exposed to more complex traumatic experiences, such as maltreatment. We conducted an updated systematic review of the evidence-base for psychological treatments for PTSD, specifically for maltreated young people. Fifteen randomized controlled trials and five non-randomized controlled clinical trials satisfied the inclusion criteria. Trials included treatments ranging from trauma-focused CBT to creative-based therapies. Trauma-focused CBT remained the best supported treatment for children and adolescents following child maltreatment, with new evidence that symptom improvements are maintained at longer-term follow up. The evidence for other therapies remained limited, and there were concerns regarding methodological quality. Implications for treatment decision-making are discussed.","Bennett, Rhiannon S; Denne, Megan; McGuire, Rosie; Hiller, Rachel M",Child maltreatment,https://doi.org/10.1177/1077559520961176; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33016112/,359

Faecal samples from 18 out of 20 Brown Norway (BN) rats, housed in the same barrier as the H. pullorum-infected mice, were positive for H. pullorum using species-specific PCR. In addition, we determined whether H. pullorum was able to persistently colonize the gastrointestinal tract and/or biliary tree and elicit tissue inflammation as well as a serum IgG response in BN rats. Six (four male, two female) 6-week-old, H. pullorum-negative BN rats were orally dosed with 4×10(8) c.f.u. of H. pullorum every other day for a total of three doses. At 2 weeks post-infection, all rats were H. pullorum-positive by faecal PCR. Five out of the six BN rats remained H. pullorum-positive for the entire 30 week study. PCR analysis of tissue collected at necropsy confirmed that the colon and caecum were the primary sites of H. pullorum colonization. Rats that were persistently colonized by H. pullorum had a sustained H. pullorum-specific IgG response measured by ELISA. Intestinal or hepatic pathology associated with H. pullorum infection was not noted. To our knowledge, this is the first report documenting that rats can be persistently colonized with an EHS that also infects humans.","Cacioppo, Laura D; Turk, Michelle L; Shen, Zeli; Ge, Zhongming; Parry, Nicola; Whary, Mark T; Boutin, Samuel R; Klein, Hilton J; Fox, James G",Journal of medical microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jmm.0.042374-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22580914/,359

This study aimed to provide population-level information on racial/ethnic disparities in HIT use and associated trends among those living with chronic diseases. The study sample consisted of adult respondents (≥18 years) of the 2011-2018 National Health Interview Survey living with at least 1 chronic condition. Binomial regression was used to analyze the association between race/ethnicity, year, and 4 measures of HIT use for patient-provider interaction. Regression parameter estimates were used to predict the trends in probability of the outcome variables across race/ethnicity. About 73% of the study sample were non-Hispanic Whites, 15% were non-Hispanic Blacks, and 13% were Hispanics. Compared to non-Hispanic Whites, there were decreased adjusted odds of any HIT use among non-Hispanic Blacks (OR = 0.72; 95% CI = 0.67, 0.76) and Hispanics (OR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.72, 0.84). The likelihood of any HIT use increased with increasing year (OR: 1.16; 95% CI = 1.15, 1.18). Trends in racial/ethnic disparities were wider for email communication with provider and online prescription refill compared to online scheduling of appointment. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to accelerated adoption or expansion of HIT for patient care. Limited HIT use among non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics could worsen the disproportionate chronic disease burden, suboptimal clinical outcomes, and preventable health care costs experienced by this subpopulation. In conclusion, there is a need for intentional and strategic population-level interventions to increase HIT adoption and use among non-Hispanic Blacks and Hispanics living with chronic diseases.","Ojinnaka, Chinedum O; Adepoju, Omolola E",Population health management,https://doi.org/10.1089/pop.2021.0055; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33989085/,359

The objective of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of quantitative assessment, using a nonrigid CT-CT coregistration algorithm. Materials and Methods 25 patients treated with RFA for HCC between 2009 and 2014 were retrospectively included. Semiautomated coregistration of pre- and posttreatment CECT was performed independently by two radiologists. In scans with a reliable registration, the tumor and ablation area were delineated to identify the side and size of narrowest RFA margin. In addition, qualitative assessment was performed independently by two other radiologists to determine technical success and the anatomical side and size of narrowest margin. Interobserver agreement rates were determined for both methods, and the outcomes were compared with occurrence of local tumor progression (LTP). Results CT-CT coregistration was technically feasible in 18/25 patients with almost perfect interobserver agreement for quantitative analysis (κ = 0.88). The interobserver agreement for qualitative RFA margin analysis was κ = 0.64. Using quantitative assessment, negative ablative margins were found in 12/18 patients, with LTP occurring in 8 of these patients. In the remaining 6 patients, quantitative analysis demonstrated complete tumor ablation and no LTP occurred. Conclusion Feasibility of quantitative RFA margin assessment using nonrigid coregistration of pre- and postablation CT is limited, but appears to be a valuable tool in predicting LTP in HCC patients (p=0.013).","Hendriks, P; Noortman, W A; Baetens, T R; van Erkel, A R; van Rijswijk, C S P; van der Meer, R W; Coenraad, M J; de Geus-Oei, L F; Slump, C H; Burgmans, M C",Journal of oncology,https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/4049287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641353/,359

While the knowledge generated by many research activities has been directly incorporated into the current generation of pandemic plans, scientists and policymakers are yet to capitalise fully on the potential for near real-time analytics to formally contribute to epidemic decision-making. Theoretical studies demonstrate that it is now possible to make robust estimates of pandemic impact in the earliest stages of a pandemic using first few hundred household cohort (FFX) studies and algorithms designed specifically for analysing FFX data. Pandemic plans already recognise the importance of both situational awareness i.e., knowing pandemic impact and its key drivers, and the need for pandemic special studies and related analytic methods for estimating these drivers. An important next step is considering how information from these situational assessment activities can be integrated into the decision-making processes articulated in pandemic planning documents. Here we introduce a decision support tool that directly uses outputs from FFX algorithms to present recommendations on response options, including a quantification of uncertainty, to decision makers. We illustrate this approach using response information from within the Australian influenza pandemic plan.","Shearer, Freya M; Moss, Robert; Price, David J; Zarebski, Alexander E; Ballard, Peter G; McVernon, Jodie; Ross, Joshua V; McCaw, James M",Epidemics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epidem.2021.100478; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34174521/,359

Moreover, some particular features related to COVID-19 are also discussed. SUMMARY Apart from a thorough preoperative assessment, preventive strategies and well-chosen monitoring should be implemented to preclude inadvertent events in sometimes high-risk patients. Timely preventive measures and early recognition of complications could only be achieved by a multidisciplinary cooperating team. In addition, the implementation of safety measurements due to the infectious transmission to both the patients and care givers is crucial.","Bockstael, Brecht; Najafi, Nadia; Poelaert, Jan",Current opinion in anaesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aco.0000000000000888; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32628405/,359

METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted using databases of Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library from the times of their inception to April 2020. Studies were selected based on inclusion and exclusion criteria after assessing the risk of bias in comparative studies with Cochrane and rating quality of evidence with the GRADE methodology. The meta-analysis was carried out using the Review Manager 5.4 program to conduct homogeneity tests. RESULTS One cohort study and three randomized controlled trials (RCT), including a total of 1457 participants were included in the meta-analysis. ETA included endovenous laser ablation (ELVA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) in the selected studies. Comparison between CA and a combination of EVLA and RFA or RFA alone were carried out in two of RCTs, while comparison between CA with EVLA was conducted in one RCT and the cohort study. There was no statistical difference in closure rates between CA and ETA after pooled analysis. Similar symptom alleviation observed between different groups. However, the CA group showed a lower ecchymosis rate than RFA and a significantly lower incidence of adverse events, such as ecchymosis, phlebitis and paresthesia, than EVLA. Compared with ETA, the patients received CA treatment exhibited lower pain scores in a shorter procedure duration without needing compression stocking, returned to normal life sooner, and had significantly better quality of care. There was no significant difference in the number needed to treat for additional therapy after three months of follow-up between groups. CONCLUSIONS This meta-analysis indicates that CA has better overall outcomes than ETA and offers superior clinical benefits in the treatment of incompetent saphenous veins.","Guo, Julong; Zhang, Fan; Guo, Jianming; Guo, Lianrui; Gu, Yongquan; Huang, Ying",Phlebology,https://doi.org/10.1177/02683555211008762; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33870789/,359

Not surprisingly then, emotional awareness is often a target of cognitive and behavioral therapies. However, little is known about what emotional awareness is related to in daily life, which would inform how and for whom emotional awareness training should be conducted in therapeutic settings. The goal of the current studies was to examine associations among facets of emotional awareness and repetitive thinking (i.e., rumination, worry, and reflection), emotion regulation, and coping in daily life. We conducted two 7-day daily diary studies (n = 172 in Study 1, n = 211 in Study 2) measuring daily experiences of repetitive negative thinking, emotion regulation efforts, and coping. Multilevel models showed that trait levels of emotional clarity were negatively associated, at the between-person level, with daily levels of repetitive negative thinking and positively associated with active coping. Additionally, daily levels of emotional clarity were associated, at the within-person level, with worrying and active coping, whereas daily levels of attention to emotions were associated, at the within-person level, with reflection.

125869,Depression during pregnancy amidst COVID-19.,2021-02-04,"N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) has been proposed and used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). By reviewing the existing pathological studies of COVID-19, it was found that abundant mucus secretion, formation of a hyaline membrane (supportive of acute respiratory distress syndrome), and interstitial fibrous exudation may be important characteristics of COVID-19 and may be pathological targets of drug therapy. In addition, multiple extrapulmonary organ injuries in COVID-19 may be associated with cytokine storm. NAC is an important antioxidant and anti-inflammatory drug. NAC has been demonstrated to have mucolytic effects in bronchitis, relieve respiratory failure in acute respiratory distress syndrome, and inhibit fibrous exudation in interstitial lung disease in clinical studies. These findings suggest that NAC may have a therapeutic effect on the pathological targets of COVID-19. Furthermore, NAC decreases TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-17 serum levels in patients with sepsis, severe burns, acute liver failure, or peritoneal dialysis and may also reduce cytokine storm in COVID-19. The antiviral effect of NAC on other respiratory viruses may also benefit COVID-19 patients. Summarizing the potential mechanisms of NAC in treating COVID-19 suggests that the role of NAC in COVID-19 treatment is worthy of further research.","Zhou, Nan; Yang, Xiaofan; Huang, Aie; Chen, Zhenbing",Current pharmaceutical biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.2174/1389201021999201228212043; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33371832/,359

We hypothesize that the degree of cervical fibrosis is associated with swallowing dysfunction. This study evaluated the association between cervical fibrosis and swallowing dysfunction in patients after radiation therapy for HNCA. STUDY DESIGN Cross sectional study METHODOLOGY: A convenience sample of patients with dysphagia who were at least 1 year post radiation therapy for HNCA underwent simultaneous cervical ultrasound (US) and video-fluroscopic swallow study (VFSS). US determinants of fibrosis were measurements of sternocleidomastoid fascia (SCMF) thickness bilaterally at the level of the cricoid. Primary and secondary outcome variables on VFSS were pharyngeal constriction ratio, a validated measure of pharyngeal contractility, and penetration aspiration scale (PAS). A qualitative assessment of lateral neck rotation was performed as a functional measure of neck fibrosis. RESULTS Simultaneous cervical US and VFSS examinations were performed on 18 patients with a history of radiotherapy for HNCA and on eight controls. The mean (±SD) age of the entire cohort (N = 26) was 66 (±10) years. Individuals with a history of radiation had significantly thinner mean SCMF (0.26 [±0.04 mm]) compared to controls (0.48 [±0.06 mm]; P < .05). Individuals with thinner SCMF were more likely to have moderate to severe restriction in lateral neck rotation, a higher PCR, and a higher PAS (P < .05). CONCLUSION Thinner sternocleidomastoid fascia on ultrasound in patients having undergone radiotherapy for head and neck cancer was associated with reduced lateral neck movement, poorer pharyngeal constriction and greater penetration/aspiration scale. The data suggest that cervical fibrosis is associated with swallowing dysfunction in head and neck cancer survivors and support the notion that, ""As the neck goes, so does the swallow.""

COVID-19 is caused by the novel corona virus SARS-CoV-2, which belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus (β-CoVs) which is of greatest clinical importance since it contains many other viruses that cause respiratory disease in humans including OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV and MERS. The spike (S) glycoprotein of β-CoVs is a key virulence factor determining disease pathogenesis and host tropism, and it also mediates virus binding to host's receptors to allow viral entry into host cells, i.e., the first step in virus lifecycle. This, viral entry inhibitors are considered promising putative drugs for COVID-19. Herein, we mined the biomedical literature for viral entry inhibitors of other corona viruses, with special emphasis on β-CoVs entry inhibitors. We also outlined the structural features of SARS-CoV-2 S protein and how it differs from other β-CoVs to better understand the structural determinants of S protein binding to its human receptor (ACE2).

The disease progresses over time, and clinical management guidelines should reflect its dynamic nature. There is limited evidence supporting UC management in specific clinical situations, thus precluding an evidence-based approach. AIM To use a formal consensus method - the nominal group technique (NGT) - to develop a clinical practice expert opinion to outline simple algorithms and practices, optimize UC management, and assist clinicians in making treatment decisions. METHODS The consensus was developed by an expert panel of 37 gastroenterologists from various professional organizations with experience in UC management using the qualitative and iterative NGT, incorporating deliberations based on the European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation recommendations, recent reviews of scientific literature, and pertinent discussion topics developed by a steering committee. Examples of clinical cases for which there are limited evidence-based data from clinical trials were used. Two working groups proposed and voted on treatment algorithms that were then discussed and voted for by the nominal group as a whole, in order to reach a consensus. RESULTS A clinical practice guideline covering management of the following clinical situations was developed: (i) moderate and severe UC; (ii) acute severe UC; (iii) pouchitis; (iv) refractory proctitis, in the form of treatment algorithms.

128955,"Dermatology before, during and after COVID 19.",2020-06-09,"OBJECTIVE To test the hypothesis that selection by initial imaging modality (MRI vs CT) is associated with rate of futile recanalizations (FR) after mechanical thrombectomy (MT), we assessed this association in a multicenter, retrospective observational registry (BEYOND-SWIFT, NCT03496064). METHODS In 2011 patients (49.7% female, median age 73 [61-81]) included between 2009 and 2017, we performed univariate and multivariate analyses regarding the occurrence of FR. FR were defined as 90 days modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 4-6 despite successful recanalization in patients selected by MRI (N = 690) and CT (N = 1,321) with a sensitivity analysis considering only patients with mRS 5-6 as futile. RESULTS MRI as compared to CT resulted in similar rates of subsequent MT (aOR 1.048, 95% CI 0.677-1.624). Rates of FR were as follows: 571/1,489 (38%) FR mRS 4-6 including 393/1,489 (26%) FR mRS 5-6. CT based selection was associated with increased rates of futile recanalizations compared to MRI (44% [41%-47%] vs 29% [25%-32%], p < 0.001; aOR 1.77 [95%-CI: 1.25-2.51]). These findings were robust in sensitivity analysis. MRI-selected patients had a delay of approximately 30 minutes in workflow metrics in real-world university comprehensive stroke centers. However, functional outcome and mortality were more favorable in patients selected by MRI compared to patients selected with CT. CONCLUSIONS CT-selection for MT was associated with an increased risk of futile recanalizations as compared to MR-selection. Efforts are still needed to shorten workflow delays in MRI patients. Further research is needed to clarify the role of the initial imaging modality on FR occurrence and to develop a reliable FR prediction algorithm.","Meinel, Thomas Raphael; Kaesmacher, Johannes; Mosimann, Pascal John; Seiffge, David; Jung, Simon; Mordasini, Pasquale; Arnold, Marcel; Goeldlin, Martina; Hajdu, Steven D; Olivé-Gadea, Marta; Maegerlein, Christian; Costalat, Vincent; Pierot, Laurent; Schaafsma, Joanna D; Fischer, Urs; Gralla, Jan",Neurology,https://doi.org/10.1212/wnl.0000000000010614; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32847948/,359

To become polymerase substrates, a nucleotide analogue must be phosphorylated by cellular kinases which is rate-limiting. The goal of this study is to develop dNTP/NTP analogues directly from nucleotides. Tenofovir (TFV) analogues were synthesized by conjugating with amino acids. We demonstrate that some conjugates act as dNTP analogues and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) catalytically incorporates the TFV part as the chain terminator. X-ray structures in complex with HIV-1 RT/dsDNA showed binding of the conjugates at the polymerase active site, however, in different modes in the presence of Mg2+ versus Mn2+ ions. The adaptability of the compounds is seemingly essential for catalytic incorporation of TFV by RT. 4d with a carboxyl sidechain demonstrated the highest incorporation. 4e showed weak incorporation and rather behaved as a dNTP-competitive inhibitor. This result advocates the feasibility of designing NTP/dNTP analogues by chemical substitutions to nucleotide analogues.","Gu, Weijie; Martinez, Sergio; Nguyen, Hoai; Xu, Hongtao; Herdewijn, Piet; De Jonghe, Steven; Das, Kalyan",Journal of medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.0c01747; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33356231/,359

Three of the four HFRS hantaviruses, HTNV, SEOV, and PUUV are found in China. Currently, there is no effective strategy available to reduce infection risk. In this study, we constructed a multi-epitope chimeric DNA vaccine that encodes expressing 25 glycoprotein epitopes from SEOV, HTNV and PUUV (designated as SHP chimeric gene). Vaccination of BALb/c mice with SHP multi-epitope chimeric DNA vaccine led to a dramatic augmentation of humoral and cellular responses. The SHP vaccine DNA was detected in many organs but not for more than 60 d. There was no risk of mutation due to integration. Thus, the SHP multi-epitope chimeric DNA vaccine is a potential effective and safe DNA vaccine against infection by SEOV, HTNV, and PUUV.","Zhao, Chen; Sun, Ying; Zhao, Yujie; Wang, Si; Yu, Tongtong; Du, Feng; Yang, X Frank; Luo, Enjie",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.4161/hv.18389; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22426376/,359

We identified patients with ICH from the overall trial population enrolled in the Apixaban for Reduction in Stroke and Other Thromboembolic Events in Atrial Fibrillation trial who received ≥1 dose of the study drug (n = 18 140). ICH was adjudicated by a central committee. Cox regression models were used to identify factors associated with ICH. ICH occurred in 174 patients; most ICH events were spontaneous (71.7%) versus traumatic (28.3%). Apixaban resulted in significantly less ICH (0.33% per year), regardless of type and location, than warfarin (0.80% per year). Independent factors associated with increased risk of ICH were enrollment in Asia or Latin America, older age, prior stroke/transient ischemic attack, and aspirin use at baseline. Among warfarin-treated patients, the median (25th, 75th percentiles) time from most recent international normalized ratio (INR) to ICH was 13 days (6, 21 days). Median INR prior to ICH was 2.6 (2.1, 3.0); 78.5% of patients had a pre-ICH INR <3.0. After ICH, the modified Rankin scale score at discharge was ≥4 in 55.7% of patients, and the overall mortality rate at 30 days was 43.3% with no difference between apixaban- and warfarin-treated patients. ICH occurred at a rate of 0.80% per year with warfarin regardless of INR control and at a rate of 0.33% per year with apixaban and was associated with high short-term morbidity and mortality. This highlights the clinical relevance of reducing ICH by using apixaban rather than warfarin and avoiding concomitant aspirin, especially in patients of older age.

131175,Psychological aspects of COVID-19.,2020-09-01,"Family history is a major risk factor for breast cancer; approximately 5-10% cases of breast cancer are associated with a family history. Herein, we investigated the link between family history and breast cancer features to elucidate the importance of family history in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Data from 10,549 patients with breast cancer were collected from 2014 to 2017. Detailed information about the family history of the patients including the degree and number of relatives affected and the types of cancer was recorded. The tumors were pathologically and clinically classified based on the stage, grade, ER, PR, HER2, Ki-67 status, and subtypes, according to standard guidelines. Data were analyzed using χ2 test and multiple logistic regression. Patients with a family history of other cancer types were significantly older at diagnosis than patients with a family history of breast/ovarian cancer (p = 0.002) and those without a family history of cancer (p < 0.001). Patients without a family history of cancer were typically diagnosed at a later stage, including high frequency in N2 (p = 0.035) and TNM stage III (p = 0.015). Compared with patients with second-/third-degree relatives, those with first-degree relatives having breast/ovarian cancer had a higher median age (54.1, p < 0.001) at diagnosis and showed more advanced disease. No significant difference was found between ER, PR, and HER2 status in patients with and without a family history of cancer. Family history of breast cancer can influence the cancer characteristics of the patients at diagnosis, especially patient age, tumor stage, and grade.","Liu, Lei; Hao, Xiaomeng; Song, Zian; Zhi, Xiangcheng; Zhang, Sheng; Zhang, Jin",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-85899-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33737705/,359

METHODS Medical records of cats presented at our institution with intussusception between 2001 and 2016 were reviewed. The following data were retrieved: signalment; history; physical examination; diagnostic imaging, surgical and histological findings; and outcomes. Animals were grouped as with or without enteroplication. Duration of surgery, survival, complication and recurrence rates, duration of hospitalisation, and short- and long-term outcomes were compared. RESULTS Cats with intussusception presented with unspecific type and duration of clinical signs. Male or male castrated cats and Maine Coons were over-represented in both groups. Enteroplication was performed in 48% (10/21) of the cats. Cats in the enteroplication group were significantly younger than those in the non-enteroplication group ( P = 0.023). Duration of surgery, time of hospitalisation, complication rate and outcomes did not differ between the two groups. Two complications in the short term and one complication in the long term were possibly associated with enteroplication. A recurrence of intussusception was seen in 2/17 cats approximately 12 months after initial surgery, both previously treated with enteroplication. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Although the number of cases was limited, our results suggest that enteroplication should be cautiously performed in cats with intussusception as it may be associated with major complications in the short and long term, and its efficacy remains unclear. Based on this study, the need for enteroplication in cats following a correction of intussusception could be questioned.","Haider, Georg; Leschnik, Katharina; Katic, Nikola; Dupré, Gilles",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1098612x18786599; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30056771/,359

133233,Bereavement via Zoom during COVID-19.,2021-03-27,"Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) poses a major threat to the global pork production and has been notorious for its rapid genetic evolution in the field. The nonstructural protein 2 (nsp2) replicase protein represents the fastest evolving region of PRRSV, but the underlying biological significance has remained poorly understood. By deletion mutagenesis, we discovered that the nsp2 hypervariable region played an important role in controlling the balance of genomic RNA and a subset of subgenomic mRNAs. More significantly, we revealed a unexpected link of nsp2 hypervariable region to viral tropism. Specifically, a mutant of the Chinese highly pathogenic PRRSV strain JXwn06 carrying a deletion spanning nsp2 amino acids 323 to 521 (nsp2Δ323-521) in its hypervariable region was found to lose the infectivity in primary porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs), despite that it could replicate relatively efficiently in supporting cell line MARC-145 cells. Consequently, this mutant failed to establish an infection in piglets. Further dissection of the viral life cycle revealed that the mutant had defect(s) lying in the steps between virus penetration and negative-stranded RNA synthesis. Taken together our results reveal novel functions of nsp2 in PRRSV life cycle and provide important insight into the mechanisms of PRRSV RNA synthesis and cellular tropism.IMPORTANCE The PRRSV nsp2 replicase protein undergoes rapid and broad genetic variations in its middle region in the field, but the underlying significance has remained enigmatic. Here we demonstrate that the nsp2 hypervariable region not only plays an important regulatory role in maintaining the balance of different viral mRNA species but also regulates PRRSV tropism to primary PAMs. Our results reveal novel functions for PRRSV nsp2 and have important implications in understanding the mechanisms of PRRSV RNA synthesis and cellular tropism.","Song, Jiangwei; Gao, Peng; Kong, Can; Zhou, Lei; Ge, Xinna; Guo, Xin; Han, Jun; Yang, Hanchun",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01436-19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554681/,359
133487,[The cure: a question of merit?],2020-04-01,"PURPOSE Acute stroke patients presenting with a distal internal carotid artery occlusion and patent carotid terminus, allowing for collateral flow via the circle of Willis, may have a more favorable natural history. Therefore, benefit of endovascular treatment (EVT) is less evident. We performed an exploratory analysis of EVT results compared to conservative treatment in patients with 'carotid-I' occlusions. METHODS We report on EVT-treated and non-EVT-treated patients with carotid-I occlusions from the MR CLEAN Registry, MR CLEAN trial, and our comprehensive stroke center. CT-angiography was reviewed on primary collateral patency and choroid plexus enhancement. Perfusion deficits were assessed on CT-perfusion (CTP). Clot migration was assessed by comparing clot location on baseline CTA to its location on periprocedural digital subtraction angiography. Outcomes included 90-day functional independence (mRS 0-2), successful reperfusion and mortality. RESULTS We included 51 patients. Forty-one patients received EVT, ten patients did not. Intravenous thrombolysis was administered in 32 (78%) EVT-treated patients and 6 (60%) non-EVT-treated patients. CTP, available for 17 patients, showed hypoperfusion on cerebral blood flow maps in 13 (76%) patients. Successful reperfusion after EVT occurred in 23 (56%), and clot migration in 8 patients (20%). Functional independence was achieved in 54% (21/39) of EVT-treated and in 10% (1/10) of non-EVT-treated patients. Mortality was 26% (10/39) and 30% (3/10), respectively. Anterior choroidal artery patency and choroid plexus enhancement were positively associated with functional independence.

METHODS This multicenter, randomized, non-inferiority trial randomly assigned the patients in a 2:1 ratio to laparoscopic CLGES versus LAGB and followed them for 1 year. We enrolled 210 patients, of whom 50 were withdrawn preoperatively. Among 160 remaining patients (mean age=39±11 years; 75% women; mean body mass index=43±6 kg m-2) 106 received CLGES and 54 received LAGB. The first primary end point was non-inferiority of CLGES versus LAGB, ascertained by the proportion of patients who, at 1 year, fulfilled: (a) a ⩾20% excess weight loss (EWL); (b) no major device- or procedure-related adverse event (AE); and (c) no major, adverse change in QOL. Furthermore, ⩾50% of patients had to reach ⩾25% EWL. The incidence and seriousness of all AE were analyzed and compared using Mann-Whitney's U-test. RESULTS At 1 year, the proportions of patients who reached all components of the primary study end point were 66.7 and 73.0% for the LAGB and CLGES group, respectively, with a difference of -6.3% and an upper 95% CI of 7.2%, less than the predetermined 10% margin for confirming the non-inferiority of CLGES. The second primary end point was also met, as 61.3% of patients in the CLGES group reached ⩾25% EWL (lower 95% CI=52.0%; P<0.01). QOL improved significantly and similarly in both groups. AE were significantly fewer and less severe in the CLGES than in the LAGB group (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This randomized study confirmed the non-inferiority of CLGES compared with LAGB based on the predetermined composite end point. CLGES was associated with significantly fewer major AE.","Horbach, T; Meyer, G; Morales-Conde, S; Alarcón, I; Favretti, F; Anselmino, M; Rovera, G M; Dargent, J; Stroh, C; Susewind, M; Torres, A J",International journal of obesity,https://doi.org/10.1038/ijo.2016.159; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27633147/,359

The aim of the present review is to analyse the current available techniques and evidence about the impact of an endoscopic approach on conduit quality and clinical outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS At present, the available techniques for endoscopic vessel harvesting can be based on a sealed or non-sealed concept, for both saphenous vein and radial artery procurement. Despite the proven advantages of a minimally invasive approach in terms of reduced incidence of wound complications, pain reduction and improved cosmetic results, some studies questioned the impact of this technique in terms of potential graft damage, thus impairing the longevity of the graft itself. SUMMARY Endoscopic conduit harvesting can be performed safely and effectively with the currently available techniques, albeit a careful knowledge of the pitfalls of each technique is mandatory. Since there is ample evidence in literature that a minimally invasive approach for saphenous vein and radial artery procurement is not associated with an increased risk of graft damage and related failure in the mid-long term, the endoscopic technique should be adopted as the approach of choice for saphenous vein and radial artery harvesting in coronary artery bypass graft surgery.","Bisleri, Gianluigi; Muneretto, Claudio",Current opinion in cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/hco.0000000000000231; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26398415/,359
135210,Remote Lactation Support in the COVID-19 Era.,2021-06-01,"Programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) is a widely used translational mechanism facilitating the expression of two polypeptides from a single mRNA. Commonly, the ribosome interacts with an mRNA secondary structure that promotes -1 frameshifting on a homopolymeric slippery sequence. Recently, we described an unusual -2 frameshifting (-2 PRF) signal directing efficient expression of a transframe protein [nonstructural protein 2TF (nsp2TF)] of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) from an alternative reading frame overlapping the viral replicase gene. Unusually, this arterivirus PRF signal lacks an obvious stimulatory RNA secondary structure, but as confirmed here, can also direct the occurrence of -1 PRF, yielding a third, truncated nsp2 variant named ""nsp2N."" Remarkably, we now show that both -2 and -1 PRF are transactivated by a protein factor, specifically a PRRSV replicase subunit (nsp1β). Embedded in nsp1β's papain-like autoproteinase domain, we identified a highly conserved, putative RNA-binding motif that is critical for PRF transactivation. The minimal RNA sequence required for PRF was mapped within a 34-nt region that includes the slippery sequence and a downstream conserved CCCANCUCC motif. Interaction of nsp1β with the PRF signal was demonstrated in pull-down assays. These studies demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that a protein can function as a transactivator of ribosomal frameshifting. The newly identified frameshifting determinants provide potential antiviral targets for arterivirus disease control and prevention. Moreover, protein-induced transactivation of frameshifting may be a widely used mechanism, potentially including previously undiscovered viral strategies to regulate viral gene expression and/or modulate host cell translation upon infection.","Li, Yanhua; Treffers, Emmely E; Napthine, Sawsan; Tas, Ali; Zhu, Longchao; Sun, Zhi; Bell, Susanne; Mark, Brian L; van Veelen, Peter A; van Hemert, Martijn J; Firth, Andrew E; Brierley, Ian; Snijder, Eric J; Fang, Ying",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1321930111; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24825891/,359

These inhibitors render FVIII replacement therapy ineffective and increase the morbidity and mortality risk. The currently accepted method to eradicate inhibitors is immune tolerance induction (ITI), and frequent intensive administration of FVIII until inhibitor titers drop. Current ITI protocols are extremely costly and not effective in all patients. During the last decade, many types of research have been accomplished to clarify the mechanisms that mediate immune tolerance induction.

Emphasis was placed on the classification of the main signs and symptoms for each organ and system, which will serve as warning signs, to guide the pediatrician in the investigation of the main IEI. In addition, the main secondary changes in the immune system triggered by infections (with emphasis on COVID-19), drugs, chronic diseases, metabolic and nutritional disorders were identified. SOURCES OF DATA This review included articles published in the last five years and that were identified in the MEDLINE platform (PubMed). SUMMARY OF FINDINGS The recurrence of infectious processes, associated with the severity of the condition and/or unusual profile of the infectious agent, always related to the age range of symptom onset, are the most important findings for suspected diagnosis. CONCLUSIONS Considering this scenario, immunity disorders should be part of the investigation carried out by the general pediatrician, whether they are the innate errors of immunity (primary immunodeficiencies) or secondary immunodeficiencies, so that the diagnosis is attained as early as possible and therapeutic measures are implemented, reducing the morbidity and mortality of these patients.","Barreto, Irma Cecília Douglas Paes; Barreto, Bruno Acatauassú Paes; Cavalcante, Erica Gomes do Nascimento; Condino Neto, Antonio",Jornal de pediatria,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jped.2020.10.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33238140/,359

135890,COVID-19 and 'basal' exacerbation frequency in COPD.,2020-12-22,"BACKGROUND This study aimed at comparing air-sealing characteristics of the new tapered-shaped tracheal tube cuffs with cylindrical tube cuffs. METHODS Tracheal tubes with tapered-shaped polyurethane (PU) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) cuffs as well as standard cylindrical-shaped cuffs made of PU and PVC (Covidien, Athlone, Ireland) were investigated. A tracheal model attached to a test lung was intubated, and cuffs were inflated to 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30 cm H(2)O. The test lung was ventilated with intermittent positive pressure ventilation at peak inspiratory pressures (PIPs) of 20 and 25 cm H(2)O. Air leakage was assessed by spirometry and measurement of sevoflurane concentration passing the cuff at the upper cuff border using an anaesthetic gas analyser. Experiments were repeated four times with new tracheal tubes for each run. Statistical comparisons were done using Mann-Whitney U-test with level of significance at P < 0.05. RESULTS The tapered-shaped PVC tube cuff demonstrated a significantly lower air leakage determined by spirometry than the cylindrical-shaped cuff at both PIPs (20 and 25 cm H(2)O). Similarly, sevoflurane leakage was less with the tapered PVC cuff particularly at higher cuff pressures. With the PU cuff, reduction in air leakage by a tapered-shaped compared with a cylindrical-shaped tube cuff was not significant. CONCLUSIONS A tapered-shaped tube cuff considerably improves air-sealing characteristics of PVC tube cuffs and allows thereby reducing cuff pressure required for sufficient ventilation. In tube cuffs made of PU that exhibits superior sealing characteristics compared with PVC, a tapered shape failed to result in a further reduction of air leakage.","Madjdpour, C; Mauch, J; Dave, M H; Spielmann, N; Weiss, M",Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-6576.2011.02542.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22091784/,359
135918,Leveraging Virtual Boot Camp to Alleviate First Year Dermatology Resident Anxiety.,2021-01-01,"UNLABELLED Infected macrophages in spinal cords of mice persistently infected with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) undergo apoptosis, resulting in restricted virus yields, as do infected macrophages in culture. Apoptosis of murine macrophages in culture occurs via the intrinsic pathway later in infection (>10 h postinfection [p.i.]) after maximal virus titers (150 to 200 PFU/cell) have been reached, with loss of most infectious virus (<5 PFU/cell) by 20 to 24 h p.i. Here, we show that BeAn virus RNA replication, translation, polyprotein processing into final protein products, and assembly of protomers and pentamers in infected M1-D macrophages did not differ from those processes in TMEV-infected BHK-21 cells, which undergo necroptosis. However, the initial difference from BHK-21 cell infection was seen at 10 to 12 h p.i., where virions from the 160S peak in sucrose gradients had incompletely processed VP0 (compared to that in infected BHK-21 cells). Thereafter, there was a gradual loss of the 160S virion peak in sucrose gradients, with replacement by a 216S peak that was observed to contain pentamers among lipid debris in negatively stained grids by electron microscopy. After infection or incubation of purified virions with activated caspase-3 in vitro, 13- and 17-kDa capsid peptide fragments were observed and were predicted by algorithms to contain cleavage sites within proteins by cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases. These findings suggest that caspase cleavage of sites in exposed capsid loops of assembled virions occurs contemporaneously with the onset and progression of apoptosis later in the infection. IMPORTANCE Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) infection in mice results in establishment of virus persistence in the central nervous system and chronic inflammatory demyelinating disease, providing an experimental animal model for multiple sclerosis. Virus persistence takes place primarily in macrophages recruited into the spinal cord that undergo apoptosis and in turn may facilitate viral spread via infected apoptotic blebs. Infection of murine macrophages in culture results in restricted virus yields late in infection. Here it is shown that the early steps of the virus life cycle in infected macrophages in vitro do not differ from these processes in TMEV-infected BHK-21 cells, which undergo necroptosis. However, the findings late in infection suggest that caspases cleave sites in exposed capsid loops and possibly internal sites of assembled virions occurring contemporaneously with onset and progression of apoptosis. Mechanistically, this would explain the dramatic loss in virus yields during TMEV-induced apoptosis and attenuate the virus, enabling persistence.","Arslan, Sevim Yildiz; Son, Kyung-No; Lipton, Howard L",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.03035-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26792734/,359

The present investigation determined predictors of perceived H1N1 contraction risk and vaccination intentions among Canadian adults (N = 1,027) responding to an online questionnaire. The relatively low rate of vaccination intent (30.12%, and 34.99% being unsure of their intent) was related to a sense of invulnerability regarding illness contraction and symptom severity. Most individuals were skeptical that H1N1 would be widespread, believing that less than 10% of the population would contract H1N1. Yet, they also indicated that their attitudes would change once a single person they knew contracted the illness. Also, worry regarding H1N1 was related to self-contraction risk and odds of individuals seeking vaccination. Moreover, vaccination intent was related to the perception that the threat was not particularly great, mistrust of the media to provide accurate information regarding H1N1, and whether individuals endorsed problem-focused versus avoidant coping strategies. Given the role media plays in public perceptions related to a health crisis, trust in this outlet and credibility regarding the threat are necessary for adherence to recommended measures to minimize health risk.","Taha, Sheena Aislinn; Matheson, Kimberly; Anisman, Hymie",Journal of health communication,https://doi.org/10.1080/10810730.2012.727960; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23301849/,359

The etiological diagnosis presupposes the isolation of virus genetic material in the patient's biological sample but laboratory diagnostics also make use of searching possibility for IgG, IgM classes antibodies. The characteristics of the antibody response are not yet completely clear. Methods This study describes a serological monitoring of subjects, elderly nursing care residence guests, interested by a very large infection outbreak. After first nasopharyngeal swab, all the positive subjects (43) were monitored for the persistence of the virus infection through nasopharyngeal swab after 20 days (16-24), 32 days (28-36) and after 49 days (47-50). At the same time, during the second (day 32) and third (day 49) follow up, all the guests were investigated for IgM and IgG anti SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, by using a quantitative chemiluminescence method. Results Thirty two days after performing the first diagnostic swab, 39 of 43 patients (90%) had IgG higher than the cut off value. After 49 days the four patients with negative IgG were still negative. The comparison of the levels of IgG-Ab between the controls shows a significant decrease in concentrations (-10%). Conclusions Our study confirms that in most patients affected by COVID-19 there is a typical antibody response with IgG-Ab present in 90% of nursing care COVID-19 positive residence guests. For IgM-Ab only 23% of tested subjects were positive on the 32nd and 49th day of illness, always in parallel with the IgG-Ab positivity.","Carta, Mariarosa; Bragagnolo, Luciana; Tramarin, Andrea; Barzon, Elena; Cappelletti, Anna; Pascarella, Michela; Forner, Lauretta; Meneghini, Maria Grazia; Tripodi, Chiara; Rassu, Mario; Giavarina, Davide",Diagnosis,https://doi.org/10.1515/dx-2020-0094; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32827394/,359

METHODS A total of 25 Gy of radiation was delivered in 5 daily fractions over 1 week to the entire ipsilateral hemithorax with concomitant boost of 5 Gy to volumes at high risk based on computed tomography and positron emission tomography scan findings. EPP was performed at 6 ± 2 days after the end of radiation therapy. Adjuvant chemotherapy was offered to patients with ypN2 disease. RESULTS A total of 62 patients were included between November 2008 and October 2014. One patient died in the hospital 2 months after EPP, for an operative mortality of 1.6%, and 2 died after discharged from the hospital for an overall treatment-related mortality (grade 5 toxicity) of 4.8%. Twenty-four patients (39%) developed grade 3 to 5 (grade 3+) complications. On final pathology, 94% of the patients were stage III or IV, and 52% had ypN2 disease. The median survival for all patients as an intention-to-treat analysis was 36 months. The median overall survival and disease-free survival was 51 and 47 months, respectively, in epithelial subtypes, compared with 10 and 8 months in biphasic subtypes (P = .001). Ipsilateral chest recurrence occurred in 8 patients. CONCLUSIONS Accelerated hemithoracic IMRT followed by EPP has become our preferred approach for resectable MPM. The results have been encouraging in patients with epithelial subtype.","de Perrot, Marc; Feld, Ronald; Leighl, Natasha B; Hope, Andrew; Waddell, Thomas K; Keshavjee, Shaf; Cho, B C John",The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtcvs.2015.09.129; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26614413/,359
137116,Short-term outcomes after Ivor Lewis oesophagectomy for cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic.,2020-11-12,"BACKGROUND Disheveled-associated activator of morphogenesis (DAAM) family, including DAAM1 and DAAM2, is key regulators in Wnt signaling pathway. Although the oncogenic role of Wnt signaling pathway in colorectal cancer (CRC) was investigated in several lines, the expression and function of DAAM in CRC are still obscure. OBJECTIVE To investigate the expression and function of DAAM in CRC. METHODS DAAM1 and DAAM2 expression in high grade dysplasia (HGD), CRCs and corresponding adjacent tissues were detected with qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry (IHC). The prognostic significance of DAAM1/2 were estimated with univariate and multivariate analyses. Moreover, the correlations between clinicopathological factors and DAAM were evaluated with the χ2 test. With experiments in vitro, we investigated the function of DAAM2 in CRC cell proliferation and invasion, and investigated the underlying mechanism of how DAAM2 facilitated CRC invasion. RESULTS DAAM2, instead of DAAM1, was substantially up-regulated in CRCs compared with paired adjacent normal tissues and HGDs. The ratio of high DAAM1 and DAAM2 expression accounted for 44.83% and 46.31%, respectively. High DAAM2, instead of DAAM1, was a risk factor indicating an unfavorable prognosis of CRC. In multivariate analysis, high DAAM2 was identified as an independent prognostic biomarker of CRC predicting poor prognosis. With experiments in vitro, DAAM2 promoted invasion of CRC cells via activating PAK1 and promoting the expression of MMP7, suggesting an essential role of DAAM2 in CRC invasion. CONCLUSIONS High expression of DAAM2, instead of DAAM1, indicated an unfavorable prognosis of CRC independently, which suggested that detecting DAAM2 can help define the high-risk patients. DAAM2 activated PAK1 and promoted MMP7 expression and facilitated the invasion of CRC cells, indicating that DAAM2 may be a potential drug target of CRC.","Chen, Aimei; Liu, Zhiqiang; Wu, Quanyan; Li, Hailin",Genes & genomics,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13258-021-01111-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33974241/,359

Data on the safety of inducing transient further anemia and the benefits of IHD-RCE is limited and occasionally contradictory. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS In this retrospective crossover analysis of six patients with SCD who underwent chronic exchange with standard RCE (Cobe Spectra) followed by IHD-RCE (Spectra Optia), we compared safety and benefit outcomes with IHD-RCE vs standard RCE. RESULTS There were statistically but not clinically significant drops in blood pressure in the post-IHD phase. With IHD-RCE, there were significant reductions in red blood cell (RBC) usage and/or lower fraction of cells and significant increases in postprocedure hematocrit (Hct) associated with increased preprocedure Hct. There were no differences achieved in the time interval between procedures or in the net RBC gain with IHD-RCE. Overall, there were also no significant differences in pre- and postprocedure percentage of hemoglobin S, reticulocyte count, interval daily hemoglobin A decrement, or postprocedure white blood cell, neutrophil, or platelet counts. CONCLUSIONS Our study supports that IHD-RCE can be safely used in patients with stroke risk and compared to standard RCE, results in benefits of lower RBC usage and/or fraction of cells remaining and higher postprocedure Hct associated with higher preprocedure Hct. These findings support wider use of IHD-RCE, especially in the current environment with reduced availability of minority units.","Ziemba, Yonah; Xu, Cindy; Fomani, Katayoun M; Nandi, Vijay; Yuan, Tiejun; Rehmani, Shiraz; Sachais, Bruce S; Appiah-Kubi, Abena O; Aygun, Banu; Louie, James E; Shi, Patricia A",Transfusion,https://doi.org/10.1111/trf.16225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33368343/,359
137641,The Role of COVID-19 in Transitioning to a Better Pediatric Payment Model.,2020-10-23,"CONTEXT Medical students are faced with the challenge of synthesizing large volumes of information quickly. With the increasing accessibility of technology, a ""flipped classroom"" allows students to learn foundational material independently. Class time is instead devoted to in-depth skill building with instructors, promoting an active learning environment. This method of content delivery is also relevant given the current COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES To comprehensively evaluate the benefit of adopting a flipped classroom approach in teaching physical exam skills (PES) to first-year osteopathic medical students. METHODS A cohort study was conducted comparing first-year osteopathic students in the class of 2022 (n=201), who had taken the PES course traditionally, with the class of 2023 (n=203), who experienced the flipped classroom approach. Objective metrics such as cumulative grades, objective structural clinical examination performance (OSCE), and practical exam performance were compared using nonparametric Mann-Whitney U rank sum tests. Subjective measures such as student course evaluations were used to analyze course perceptions using independent sample t-tests assuming unequal variances. A faculty survey was administered to faculty who taught both cohorts to assess instructor attitudes toward the flipped classroom approach. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Spring 2020 quarter data was not included, given the transition of all classes to an online learning environment. RESULTS The flipped classroom approach significantly improved objective student performance for the Fall (p=0.009) and Winter (p<0.001) student cumulative grades and the History-Taking OSCE (p=0.010). Performance on Fall and Winter practical exam scores had no significant association with the flipped classroom. General student perceptions of the course remained unchanged between both cohorts. Faculty survey results from 10 faculty members showed that six (60%) faculty members preferred the traditional classroom, while four (40%) preferred the flipped classroom. CONCLUSIONS The flipped classroom approach showed some statistically significant improvement in student PES. Further studies are needed to evaluate the benefits of a flipped classroom approach using skills-based assessments styles to measure student performance, with a focus on standardization of in-classroom groupwork.","Bhai, Sahar Amin; Poustinchian, Brian",Journal of osteopathic medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/jom-2020-0198; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33694343/,359

The use of a mobile workstation was implemented as the central hub for rounding at the bedside by the attending physicians, while other members of the multidisciplinary and multispecialty team joined rounds from other locations with maintaining appropriate social distance. Fifty-eight staff members who participated in videoconferencing rounds completed the postimplementation survey. Eighty-eight per cent of staff agreed that the use of videoconferencing to facilitate rounds was an effective strategy to maintain social distancing between team members during the pandemic. Sixty-four percent of staff agreed that the use of videoconferencing improved participation of the PICU team and consultants by increasing access to rounds. Over 50% of staff agreed that the use of videoconferencing improved the efficiency of rounds and team productivity. Only 4% of staff responded that videoconferencing increased the duration of rounds and 37% responded that it decreased resident and team education. Fifty-five percent of staff agreed that videoconferencing was used to promote parental participation during this pandemic month. Videoconferencing was found to be a feasible solution to safely conduct multidisciplinary rounds while maintaining social distancing, and participants found it effective without interfering with normal workflow. Incorporating videoconferencing into traditional rounding practices may be advantageous following the pandemic to improve team and family access to rounds and workflow efficiency and rounding structure.","Custer, Jason W; Simone, Shari; Bhutta, Adnan T",Journal of pediatric intensive care,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-0040-1716578; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34395039/,359

139788,Regional disaster planning for neonatology.,2010,"INTRODUCTION The German Lung Cancer Screening Intervention Trial (LUSI) is one of the European randomized trials investigating the efficacy of low-dose multislice computed tomography (MSCT) as a screening tool for lung cancer. In the evaluation of the first (prevalence) screening round, we observed exceptionally high early recall rates, which made the routine application of MSCT screening questionable. Because screening may behave differently in subsequent (incidence) screening rounds, we analyzed (a) basic characteristics for the annual rounds 2 to 4, which have now also been completed, and (b) the first 3 years with complete follow-up since time of randomization. METHODS Data material was the data record of LUSI after the fourth screening round and the 3-year follow-up had been completed. Basic characteristics of screening, e.g., early recall rate, detection rate, and interval cancers as well of proportion of advanced cancers, were descriptively evaluated and, if informative, group differences were tested for statistical significance. RESULTS Early recall rates were significantly lower in the subsequent screening rounds than in the first one if the MSCT information from the previous screening rounds was available. Detection and biopsy rates were approximately 1% or lower, ratio of benign:malignant biopsies: 1:1.6 to 1:3. CONCLUSION Our recent data may not only settle one concern regarding high recall rates in routine MSCT screening but also indicate that screening must be strictly organized to be effective. Performance indicators are similar to those in mammography screening. Nevertheless, possible consequences for the participants (diagnostic workup of suspicious findings, biopsies) are more invasive than in mammography screening.","Becker, N; Motsch, E; Gross, M-L; Eigentopf, A; Heussel, C P; Dienemann, H; Schnabel, P A; Eichinger, M; Optazaite, D-E; Puderbach, M; Wielpütz, M; Kauczor, H-U; Tremper, J; Delorme, S",Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer,https://doi.org/10.1097/jto.0000000000000530; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25783198/,359

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of PM on intraoperative blood loss, morbidity, and posthepatectomy hemorrhage (PHH). A series of 209 consecutive patients underwent extended hepatectomy (EH) (≥5 segment resection). The association of PM with perioperative outcomes was evaluated using multivariate analysis with a propensity score method to control for confounding. Fifty patients underwent PM with a median duration of 19 minutes. Multivariate analysis revealed that risk of excessive intraoperative bleeding (≥1500 ml; odds ratio [OR] 0.27, 95%-confidence interval [CI] 0.10-0.70, p = 0.007), major morbidity (OR 0.41, 95%-CI 0.18-0.97, p = 0.041), and PHH (OR 0.22, 95%-CI 0.06-0.79, p = 0.021) were significantly lower in PM group after EH. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in 3-year recurrence-free-survival between groups. PM is associated with lower intraoperative bleeding, PHH, and major morbidity risk after EH. Performing PM does not increase posthepatectomy liver failure and does not affect recurrence rate.

The COVID-19 pandemic represents a major public health problem. A fraction of the population is at increased risk of developing complications of this disease, in particular older subjects as well as diabetic, obese and hypertensive patients. With regard to patients with high blood pressure, the existence of an increased risk remains to be confirmed in large controlled trials.

A major rate-limiting step in PPI research is the expression and purification of full-length proteins. The use of peptides to study PPIs significantly facilitates the structural and biophysical characterization of PPIs as well as the effort to develop drugs to control PPIs. Here we describe examples for the use of peptides to study PPI and some of the important experimental methods that are used in the field.

METHOD Case note review of all infants in whom laparoscopy was performed during 2016-2020 to investigate for possible malrotation. RESULTS Eight infants were identified. All presented with acute clinical features of malrotation (bilious vomit) without evidence of an alternate explanatory diagnosis. All underwent upper gastrointestinal contrast study, with three also undergoing abdominal ultrasound. The radiological examinations could not exclude malrotation and all proceeded to laparoscopy. At laparoscopy, the small intestine was run to exclude the presence of midgut volvulus. In six cases, normal rotation was confirmed and no abnormal pathology was found. Two proceeded to laparotomy and underwent correction of malrotation. All infants recovered without complication. CONCLUSION Laparoscopy is an excellent modality for further investigation of infants presenting acutely in whom intestinal malrotation cannot be formally excluded radiologically. The positive identification of the DJ flexure and cecum in correct anatomical sites, both fixed to the posterior abdominal wall, provides adequate reassurance of low risk of volvulus and avoids a full laparotomy. We recommend diagnostic laparoscopy in cases of inconclusive upper gastrointestinal contrast study.","Sloan, K; Alzamrooni, A; Stedman, F E; Ron, O; Hall, N J",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-020-04729-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803428/,359

Superantigen specificity for different Vβ-chains results in Vβ-skewing, whereby T cells with specific Vβ-chains and diverse antigen specificity are overrepresented in the TCR repertoire. Here, we characterized the TCR repertoire of MIS-C patients and found a profound expansion of TCR Βeta Variable gene (TRBV)11-2, with up to 24% of clonal T cell space occupied by TRBV11-2 T cells, which correlated with MIS-C severity and serum cytokine levels. Analysis of TRBJ gene usage and CDR3 length distribution of MIS-C expanded TRBV11-2 clones revealed extensive junctional diversity. Patients with TRBV11-2 expansion showed HLA class I allele restriction to HLA-I A02, C35 and C04, indicating a novel mechanism for CDR3-independent T cell expansion. In silico modelling indicated that polyacidic residues in the Vβ chain encoded by TRBV11-2 strongly interact with the superantigen-like motif of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, suggesting that unprocessed SARS-CoV-2 spike may directly mediate TRBV11-2 expansion. Overall, our data indicate that a CDR3-independent interaction between SARS-CoV-2 spike and TCR leads to T cell expansion and possibly activation, which may account for the clinical presentation of MIS-C.","Porritt, Rebecca A; Paschold, Lisa; Noval Rivas, Magali; Cheng, Mary Hongying; Yonker, Lael M; Chandnani, Harsha; Lopez, Merrick; Simnica, Donjete; Schultheiß, Christoph; Santiskulvong, Chintda; van Eyk, Jennifer; McCormick, John K; Fasano, Alessio; Bahar, Ivet; Binder, Mascha; Arditi, Moshe",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci146614; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33705359/,359
145241,Reflection on lower rates of COVID-19 in children: Does childhood immunizations offer unexpected protection?,2020-05-15,"BACKGROUND Typhoid fever prevention and control efforts are critical in an era of rising antimicrobial resistance among typhoid pathogens. India remains one of the highest typhoid disease burden countries, although a highly efficacious typhoid conjugate vaccine (TCV), prequalified by the World Health Organization in 2017, has been available since 2013. In 2018, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) introduced TCV into its immunization program, targeting children aged 9 months to 14 years in 11 of 22 areas (Phase 1 campaign). We describe the decision making, implementation, and delivery costing to inform TCV use in other settings. METHODS We collected information on the decision making and campaign implementation in addition to administrative coverage from NMMC and partners. We then used a microcosting approach from the local government (NMMC) perspective, using a new Microsoft Excel-based tool to estimate the financial and economic vaccination campaign costs. RESULTS The planning and implementation of the campaign were led by NMMC with support from multiple partners. A fixed-post campaign was conducted during weekends and public holidays in July-August 2018 which achieved an administrative vaccination coverage of 71% (ranging from 46% in high-income to 92% in low-income areas). Not including vaccine and vaccination supplies, the average financial cost and economic cost per dose of TCV delivery were $0.45 and $1.42, respectively. CONCLUSION The first public sector TCV campaign was successfully implemented by NMMC, with high administrative coverage in slums and low-income areas. Delivery cost estimates provide important inputs to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and affordability of TCV vaccination through public sector preventive campaigns.","Date, Kashmira; Shimpi, Rahul; Luby, Stephen; N, Ramaswami; Haldar, Pradeep; Katkar, Arun; Wannemuehler, Kathleen; Mogasale, Vittal; Pallas, Sarah; Song, Dayoung; Kunwar, Abhishek; Loharikar, Anagha; Yewale, Vijay; Ahmed, Danish; Horng, Lily; Wilhelm, Elisabeth; Bahl, Sunil; Harvey, Pauline; Dutta, Shanta; Bhatnagar, Pankaj",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa597; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32725235/,359
145384,Quercetin Phytosome® as a potential drug for Covid-19.,2020-10-05,"We describe the discovery and isolation of a paramyxovirus, feline morbillivirus (FmoPV), from domestic cat (Felis catus). FmoPV RNA was detected in 56 (12.3%) of 457 stray cats (53 urine, four rectal swabs, and one blood sample) by RT-PCR. Complete genome sequencing of three FmoPV strains showed genome sizes of 16,050 bases, the largest among morbilliviruses, because of unusually long 5' trailer sequences of 400 nt. FmoPV possesses identical gene contents (3'-N-P/V/C-M-F-H-L-5') and is phylogenetically clustered with other morbilliviruses. IgG against FmoPV N protein was positive in 49 sera (76.7%) of 56 RT-PCR-positive cats, but 78 (19.4%) of 401 RT-PCR-negative cats (P < 0.0001) by Western blot. FmoPV was isolated from CRFK feline kidney cells, causing cytopathic effects with cell rounding, detachment, lysis, and syncytia formation. FmoPV could also replicate in subsequent passages in primate Vero E6 cells. Infected cell lines exhibited finely granular and diffuse cytoplasmic fluorescence on immunostaining for FmoPV N protein. Electron microscopy showed enveloped virus with typical ""herringbone"" appearance of helical N in paramyxoviruses. Histological examination of necropsy tissues in two FmoPV-positive cats revealed interstitial inflammatory infiltrate and tubular degeneration/necrosis in kidneys, with decreased cauxin expression in degenerated tubular epithelial cells, compatible with tubulointerstitial nephritis (TIN). Immunohistochemical staining revealed FmoPV N protein-positive renal tubular cells and mononuclear cells in lymph nodes. A case-control study showed the presence of TIN in seven of 12 cats with FmoPV infection, but only two of 15 cats without FmoPV infection (P < 0.05), suggesting an association between FmoPV and TIN.","Woo, Patrick C Y; Lau, Susanna K P; Wong, Beatrice H L; Fan, Rachel Y Y; Wong, Annette Y P; Zhang, Anna J X; Wu, Ying; Choi, Garnet K Y; Li, Kenneth S M; Hui, Janet; Wang, Ming; Zheng, Bo-Jian; Chan, K H; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1119972109; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22431644/,359

Planning of diagnostics and treatment of a dental patient with the use of modern digital technologies was proposed to be divided into stages. A complex of digital planning of dental orthopedic treatment was formed, which is illustrated by clinical case analysis. The first stage is the planning of the rehabilitation stage, which includes the diagnosis of the patient's dental status and preparation for orthopedic treatment. The second stage is 2D virtual planning of dental rows in the smile area-includes 2D visualization in the form of mandatory use of dental digital photography protocols and 2D creation of a virtual image of a smile using digital two-dimensional planning programs. The third stage includes 3D-virtual planning (mock-up) of teeth in an aesthetically significant area-included digitalization of clinical data of patients, namely, CBCT, scanning of the dentition separately and in the bite, face scanning. The fourth stage is the computer production of prototype dentures, according to the 3D virtual functional and aesthetic layout, which includes the production of prototypes of dentures by the additive method of 3D printing. At this stage, recommendations are given for the production of prototypes of dentures by 3D printing directly-in a direct way and using a silicone key-not in a direct way, obtained from a printed model of the prototype of the patient's dentition.","Apresyan, S V; Stepanov, A G; Vardanyan, B A",Stomatologiia,https://doi.org/10.17116/stomat202110003165; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34180628/,359

146831,Considerations for Young Children and Those With Special Needs as COVID-19 Continues.,2020-08-31,"BACKGROUND Many studies have investigated the role of the microbiome in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but few have focused on surgery specifically or its consequences on the metabolome that may differ by surgery type and require longitudinal sampling. Our objective was to characterize and contrast microbiome and metabolome changes after different surgeries for IBD, including ileocolonic resection and colectomy. METHODS The UC San Diego IBD Biobank was used to prospectively collect 332 stool samples from 129 subjects (50 ulcerative colitis; 79 Crohn's disease). Of these, 21 with Crohn's disease had ileocolonic resections, and 17 had colectomies. We used shotgun metagenomics and untargeted liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry metabolomics to characterize the microbiomes and metabolomes of these patients up to 24 months after the initial sampling. RESULTS The species diversity and metabolite diversity both differed significantly among groups (species diversity: Mann-Whitney U test P value = 7.8e-17; metabolomics, P-value = 0.0043). Escherichia coli in particular expanded dramatically in relative abundance in subjects undergoing surgery. The species profile was better able to classify subjects according to surgery status than the metabolite profile (average precision 0.80 vs 0.68). CONCLUSIONS Intestinal surgeries seem to reduce the diversity of the gut microbiome and metabolome in IBD patients, and these changes may persist. Surgery also further destabilizes the microbiome (but not the metabolome) over time, even relative to the previously established instability in the microbiome of IBD patients. These long-term effects and their consequences for health outcomes need to be studied in prospective longitudinal trials linked to microbiome-involved phenotypes.","Fang, Xin; Vázquez-Baeza, Yoshiki; Elijah, Emmanuel; Vargas, Fernando; Ackermann, Gail; Humphrey, Gregory; Lau, Rebecca; Weldon, Kelly C; Sanders, Jon G; Panitchpakdi, Morgan; Carpenter, Carolina; Jarmusch, Alan K; Neill, Jennifer; Miralles, Ara; Dulai, Parambir; Singh, Siddharth; Tsai, Matthew; Swafford, Austin D; Smarr, Larry; Boyle, David L; Palsson, Bernhard O; Chang, John T; Dorrestein, Pieter C; Sandborn, William J; Knight, Rob; Boland, Brigid S",Inflammatory bowel diseases,https://doi.org/10.1093/ibd/izaa262; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33026068/,359

While these anomalies are often asymptomatic, they assume clinical importance during interventions such as central venous catheterisations and pacemaker implantations and during cardiothoracic surgeries while instituting cardiopulmonary bypass and for creation of cavo-pulmonary connections. Role of imaging in identifying these anomalies is indispensable. Cross-sectional imaging techniques like CT venography and magnetic resonance (MR) venography allow direct visualisation and consequently increased detection of anomalies. CT venography plays an important role in detection of SVC anomalies as it is readily available, has excellent spatial resolution, short acquisition times and potential for reconstruction of images in multiple planes. This pictorial review focuses on the developmental anomalies of the SVC and its tributaries highlighting their embryological basis, imaging appearances on CT venography and potential clinical implications, where relevant.","Verma, Mansi; Pandey, Niraj Nirmal; Ojha, Vineeta; Kumar, Sanjeev; Ramakrishnan, Sivasubramaniam",The British journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20200856; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197326/,359

PATIENTS AND METHODS Data from an open-label, long-term multicenter study designed to assess the safety of MS-sNT for managing chronic (≥ 3 m), moderate-to-severe pain were analyzed post hoc. Initial MS-sNT dose was 20 mg twice daily (BID) for opioid-naïve patients and 50% to 75% of current daily opioid dose for opioid-experienced patients. Dose adjustments upward/downward were allowed throughout the study with ≥ 3 days between increases; opioid-experienced patients could increase ≥ 24 hours after initial drug dispensing. Nonopioid analgesics were permitted as rescue medication. Stable dose was defined post hoc as one maintained for 2 consecutive study visits. RESULTS Overall, 69% of patients (n = 319/465) achieved a stable dose; 85% (n = 272) achieved a stable dose in ≤ 2 titration dose adjustments or ""steps,"" and 96% (n = 305) achieved a stable dose in ≤ 4 steps. The mean time to stable dose was 28.9 days (standard deviation [SD], 34.1 days); the median was 12 days. A stable dose was achieved in 70% (118/168) of opioid-naïve patients (mean, 24.2 days [SD, 33.4 days]; median, 8 days) and 68% (201/297) of opioid-experienced patients (mean, 31.7 days [SD, 34.3 days]; median, 25 days). A stable dose was achieved by 79% (19/24) of patients who previously used morphine, 64% (27/42) who used oxycodone, 59% (47/79) who used hydrocodone, and 71% (83/117) who used multiple opioids. Baseline pain scores were similar between patients who did and did not achieve a stable dose. At the time of stable dose achievement, average, least, worst, and current pain were all decreased from baseline. CONCLUSIONS The study provides information about anticipated rates of achieving stable opioid dose in patients who received MS-sNT for up to 1 year to manage chronic, moderate-to-severe pain. Both opioid-naïve and opioid-experienced patients achieved a stable dose of MS-sNT, generally in ≤ 2 steps. Opioid experience and previous opioid use may influence ability to achieve a stable dose and number of steps required. More studies are needed on the anticipated experience of opioid titration/conversion to help physicians and patients set expectations for initiation of and conversion between opioid therapies.","Webster, Lynn R; Brewer, Randall; Morris, David; Cleveland, Jody M; Setnik, Beatrice",Postgraduate medicine,https://doi.org/10.3810/pgm.2011.09.2471; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21904098/,359

However, the relationship between these 2 test results and their relationship to defecography is poorly characterized. We aimed to describe this relationship and create a predictive model for pelvic floor dyssynergia on defecography. METHODS From March 2008 to April 2010 consecutive patients with symptoms suggestive of functional constipation were evaluated at our Pelvic Floor Disorders Center 125 and the results of their workups were collected prospectively. Sixty-three patients with pelvic floor dyssynergia on defecography were compared with 60 patients without dyssynergia in terms of manometry pressures, electromyographic text results, and balloon expulsion testing results (χ, t tests). RESULTS Of 125 patients meeting Rome II symptom criteria for constipation, 123 patients underwent defecography and, of these, 63 (51.2%) had evidence of pelvic floor dyssynergia. Patients with and without dyssynergia had a slight difference in mean resting pressures (62.8 mmHg vs 49.5 mmHg, P = .02) and no discernable differences in rectal sensitivity and compliance: first sensation (56.5 vs 62.5, P = .34) and maximum tolerated volume (164.2 vs 191.2, P = .09). It appeared that abnormalities in electromyographic relaxation and balloon expulsion occurred in the same patients: 84.1% of patients with abnormal electromyographic results also did not expel the balloon. However, the presence of these abnormalities, in isolation or together, did not predict the presence of dyssynergia on defecography. CONCLUSION Normal electromyographic results or the ability to expel a 60-mL balloon does not exclude the presence of pelvic floor dyssynergia on defecography. It is unclear which of these 3 tests should be used to guide the recommendation for (and to then measure response to) biofeedback.","Bordeianou, Liliana; Savitt, Lieba; Dursun, Abdulmetin",Diseases of the colon and rectum,https://doi.org/10.1007/dcr.0b013e3181fd2373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21160315/,359

While selflessly rescuing patients from death, many doctors were exposed to unacceptable risk, with little protection for themselves, and, by extension, for their families and patients. This essay examines the basis and limits of duty to treat in a time of crisis and explores how these experiences could leave doctors morally stressed and even compromised. We question whether a physician-patient relationship that treats patients' safety and well-being as separate from their doctors' personal and professional values, needs, and dignity is the best way to deliver care. Such questions predated coronavirus but were brought to the forefront because of the epidemic. As physicians process their experiences, we hope to begin a deeper moral and social conversation that might help us be better prepared for future crises.","Mangione, Salvatore; Post, Stephen G",The American journal of the medical sciences,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amjms.2020.11.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33349440/,359

METHODS We enrolled a consecutive cohort of recently diagnosed (<18 months) PD patients with unilateral manifestations using age and gender-matched controls. The most affected body region was determined using various clinical standard metrics and objective quantitative kinematic measurements. Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative data were used for external validation of the results. RESULTS Twenty-five drug-naive patients and 21 controls were studied. Upper limbs were (92%) the most affected body region at onset as ascertained by patients' self-assessment, neurologists' impression, and Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score. The upper limb (ie, hand) was the site of onset in 80% of patients. Motor features progressed to involve the lower limb but remained limited to the initially affected body side over a 2-year follow-up. Agreement among the different metrics (96%) confirmed focal upper limb predominant motor impairment at onset. The findings were confirmed by quantitative kinematic analyses and from a cohort of 34 similar patients from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative database. CONCLUSIONS Motor manifestations in PD start distally in one upper limb. The complexity of the motor repertoire and, consequently, the presumed larger dopaminergic striatal demand for maintaining skillful motor function in the upper limb, may contribute to greater vulnerability of dopaminergic striatal terminals. Recognition of this motor pattern could be used to monitor the evolution of nigrostriatal degeneration and the putative impact of therapies. © 2021 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.","Monje, Mariana H G; Sánchez-Ferro, Álvaro; Pineda-Pardo, José A; Vela-Desojo, Lydia; Alonso-Frech, Fernando; Obeso, José A",Movement disorders : official journal of the Movement Disorder Society,https://doi.org/10.1002/mds.28462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33471950/,359
153542,[Analysis of the causes of repeat stenosis of the coronary arteries after elective stenting in patients with stable angina pectoris].,2021-01-10,"BACKGROUND The influence of biofilm on the complexity of fungal diseases has been reported in recent years, especially in non-invasive mycoses such as keratitis and onychomycosis. The difficulty in treating cases of fusariosis in the human medical clinic exemplifies this situation, because when Fusarium spp. are present in the form of biofilm, the permeation of antifungal agents is compromised. OBJECTIVES This study proposes an association of clioquinol, an inhibitor of fungal cells with antifungal drugs prescribed to combat fusariosis in humans. METHODS Susceptibility was assessed by microdilution in broth. Formation of biofilm by staining with violet crystal. Inhibition and removal of biofilm using the MTT colorimetric reagent. Time-kill combination, hypoallergenicity test, cytotoxicity test, and toxicity prediction by computer analysis were also performed. RESULTS Clioquinol associated with voriconazole and with ciclopirox inhibited biofilm formation. Possibly, clioquinol acts in the germination and elongation of hyphae, while voriconazole prevents cell adhesion and ciclopirox the formation of the extracellular polymeric matrix. The CLIO-VRC association reduced the biofilm formation by more than 90%, while the CLIO-CPX association prevented over 95%. None association was irritating, and over 90% of the leukocytes remained viable. Computational analysis does not reveal toxicity relevant to CLIO, whereas VRC and CPX showed some risks for systemic use, but suitable for topical formulations. CONCLUSIONS The combination of CLIO-VRC or CLIO-CPX proved to be a promising association strategy in the medical clinic, both in combating fungal keratitis and onychomycosis, since they prevent the initial process of establishing an infection, the formation of biofilm.","de Chaves, Magda Antunes; do Amaral, Thaís Ferreira; Coutinho, Natália Monteiro da Silva Rodrigues; Andrzejewski Kaminski, Taís Fernanda; Teixeira, Mário Lettieri; de Oliveira, Luís Flavio Souza; de Andrade, Saulo Fernandes; Fuentefria, Alexandre Meneghello",Mycoses,https://doi.org/10.1111/myc.13142; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32662568/,359

The aim of this study was to evaluate the suitability of our criteria for SILC. METHODS During the study period, SILC was performed at our institution under the following criteria. The inclusion criteria were elective surgery, age of < 60 years, and body mass index of < 30 kg/m2. The exclusion criteria were a thick gallbladder wall, history of choledocholithiasis, previous abdominal surgery, and serious concomitant disease. We reviewed data regarding consecutive patients who underwent LC at our institution from November 2009 to March 2016. The data were assessed with respect to patient characteristics, operative data, and postoperative outcomes. RESULTS A total of 1093 patients underwent elective LC, and 232 (21.2%) of these patients underwent SILC using our criteria. Fourteen patients (6.0%) who underwent SILC required extra ports. Among the patients aged < 60 years, 50.2% (232/462) underwent SILC. There were few adverse events, including intra- and postoperative complications, among the patients who underwent SILC.

154194,Lung transplantation during COVID-19 outbreak in mainland China.,2020-10-01,"The impact of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) on morbidity and mortality is significant in that it causes bronchiolitis in infants, exacerbations in patients with obstructive lung disease, and pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts. RSV activates protein kinase R (PKR), a cellular kinase relevant to limiting viral replication (Groskreutz, D. J., Monick, M. M., Powers, L. S., Yarovinsky, T. O., Look, D. C., and Hunninghake, G. W. (2006) J. Immunol. 176, 1733-1740). It is activated by autophosphorylation, likely triggered by a double-stranded RNA intermediate during replication of the virus. In most instances, ph-PKR targets the alpha subunit of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2alpha) protein via phosphorylation, leading to an inhibition of translation of cellular and viral protein. However, we found that although ph-PKR increases in RSV infection, significant eIF2alpha phosphorylation is not observed, and inhibition of protein translation does not occur. RSV infection attenuates eIF2alpha phosphorylation by favoring phosphatase rather than kinase activity. Although PKR is activated, RSV sequesters PKR away from eIF2alpha by binding of the kinase to the RSV N protein. This occurs in conjunction with an increase in the association of the phosphatase, PP2A, with eIF2alpha following PKR activation. The result is limited phosphorylation of eIF2alpha and continued translation of cellular and viral proteins.","Groskreutz, Dayna J; Babor, Ellen C; Monick, Martha M; Varga, Steven M; Hunninghake, Gary W",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m109.077321; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20519500/,359

156558,COVID-19 Forecasts for Cuba Using Logistic Regression and Gompertz Curves.,2020-07-01,"BACKGROUND The role of multiple respiratory viruses in bronchiolitis treated with high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) has not been thoroughly investigated. We evaluated the contribution of coinfection on clinical course of bronchiolitis treated with HFNC and on response to this treatment. METHODS We selected 120 children with bronchiolitis, younger than 12 months, admitted to Emergency Department between 2016 and 2018 and treated with HFNC. We compared single and multiple virus infections in relation to specific outcomes such as the clinical response to HFNC and the HFNC failure. The multiple virus infection was defined by the detection of 2 or more viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates. The HFNC failure was defined as escalation to higher level of care, including Helmet-Continuous Positive Airway Pressure, invasive ventilation or transfer to pediatric intensive care unit within 48 hours from the time of HFNC initiation. We also performed a comparison between HFNC failure and HFNC not-failure groups according to the number of virus and the type of virus. RESULTS The severity score post-HFNC initiation was significantly associated with coinfection [odds ratio (OR): 1.361; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.036-1.786; P = 0.027]. The likelihood of coinfection decreased by 23.1% for each increase of saturation O2 after HFNC initiation (OR: 0.769; 95% CI: 0.609-0.972; P = 0.028). Atelectasis was more likely to occur in coinfection (OR: 2.923; 95% CI: 1.049-8.148; P = 0.04). The duration of HFNC treatment increased significantly in coinfection (OR: 1.018; 95% CI: 1.006-1.029; P = 0.002). No significant differences were described between HFNC failure and the number and the type of detected viruses. CONCLUSIONS The detection of multiple viruses and the type of virus did not influence the HFNC failure, although the coinfection was associated with a deterioration of severity score, a longer HFNC treatment and a major presence of atelectasis. The role of coinfection on HFNC treatment might subtend a complex interplay between multiple viruses and host susceptibility.","Ferro, Valentina; Boccuzzi, Elena; Battaglia, Massimo; Rossi, Francesco Paolo; Olita, Carla; Giglioni, Emanuele; Concato, Carlo; Piccioni, Livia; Perrotta, Daniela; Reale, Antonino; Raucci, Umberto",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002512; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31725117/,359

OBJECTIVES The authors compare two commercially-available knotless, barbed suture devices against a conventional monofilament suture in a porcine model for biomechanical wound strength and histological quality of healing. METHODS This prospective randomized trial included 18 animals randomly assigned among three groups, with six in each. A total of 192 incisions were closed in a porcine in vivo model and assessed for biomechanical strength and histology at postoperative Days 0, 3, 10, and 21. Each animal received all three test devices in a randomized, three-way matched design. Immediately following euthanasia, the skin incisions were excised for ex vivo biomechanical testing. RESULTS In the ex vivo analysis, Biosyn proved significantly stronger than the V-Loc 90 device at Day 0 and Quill Monoderm at Day 3. At no time point was there any difference in biomechanical strength between the two barbed suture devices. Differences in barb geometry, barb number, and helicity between the two barbed suture devices resulted in failure modes that were significantly different. All three test articles resulted in mild tissue reaction scores on histology. The V-Loc 90 device consistently had the lowest tissue reaction scores at all time periods, with the difference between the V-Loc 90 device and Quill being significant at postoperative Day 10. CONCLUSIONS Knotless, absorbable barbed suture devices are a safe and efficacious alternative for cosmetic skin closures and yield wound strength and tissue reaction scores that are comparable to those from closures performed with absorbable monofilament sutures and secured with knots.","Zaruby, Jeffrey; Gingras, Kristen; Taylor, Jack; Maul, Don",Aesthetic surgery journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/1090820x10395010; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21317121/,359

However, differences in outcomes between centers have not been evaluated. Our aim was to evaluate outcomes for robotic colorectal procedures by surgeon and hospital volume. STUDY DESIGN A national inpatient database was reviewed for robotic colorectal resections performed during an 18-month period. Hospitals and surgeons were stratified into high, average, and low case volumes based on a normal distribution scale. High, average, and low volume was defined as ≤ 10, 11 to 20, and >20, respectively, for hospitals, and ≤ 5, 6 to 15, and >15, respectively, for surgeons. Short-term outcomes and hospital cost were evaluated. RESULTS There were 1,428 robotic colorectal cases across 123 hospitals and 411 surgeons evaluated. Only 13% (n = 16) of hospitals and 4.4% (n = 18) of surgeons performed a high volume of robotic colorectal cases. Lower volume was associated with significantly more overall complications (p < 0.001; p < 0.001), longer length of stay (p = 0.005; p < 0.001), and higher cost (p < 0.001; p < 0.001) at the hospital and surgeon level, respectively. High-volume hospitals and surgeons had significantly lower rates of postoperative bleeding (p < 0.001; p < 0.001) and ileus (p = 0.003; p = 0.0014). CONCLUSIONS Lower-volume providers, who are performing the majority of procedures, are generating more complications, longer hospital lengths of stay, and higher costs of care. These results have a negative impact on quality outcomes measures for those facilities. Although surgeons and hospitals continue to selectively explore robotics, this should be limited to high volume and interested surgeons and hospitals to offer high-quality outcomes to patients.","Keller, Deborah S; Hashemi, Lobat; Lu, Minyi; Delaney, Conor P",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2013.07.390; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24041555/,359
157205,Supraclavicular or interscalene brachial plexus block for rotator cuff repair?,2016,"OBJECTIVES Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a viral illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. With the increasing number of improved and discharged patients with COVID-19, the definition of an adequate follow-up strategy is needed. The purpose of this study was to assess whether lung ultrasound (LUS) is an effective indicator of subclinical residual lung damage in patients with COVID-19 who meet discharge criteria. METHODS We prospectively enrolled 70 consecutive patients with COVID-19 who had a prolonged hospitalization with inpatient rehabilitation between April 6 and May 22, 2020. All of the patients underwent an LUS evaluation at discharge. Data of patients with more severe disease during the acute phase (ie, required ventilatory support) were compared to those of patients with milder disease. RESULTS Among the 70 patients with COVID-19 (22 women and 48 men; mean age ± SD, 68 ± 13 years), the LUS score before discharge was still frankly pathologic and higher in patients who had more severe disease during the acute phase compared to patients with milder disease (median [interquartile range], 8.0 [5.5-13.5] versus 2.0 [1.0-7.0]; P < .001), even when both categories met internationally defined discharge criteria. CONCLUSIONS Lung ultrasound can identify the persistence of subclinical residual lung damage in patients with severe COVID-19 even if they meet discharge criteria. Considering the low cost, easy application, and lack of radiation exposure, LUS seems the ideal tool to be adopted in outpatient and primary care settings for the follow-up of patients with COVID-19.","Gaspardone, Carlo; Meloni, Carlo; Preda, Alberto; Romagnolo, Davide; Brugliera, Luigia; Castellazzi, Paola; Tettamanti, Andrea; Conte, Caterina; Secchi, Antonio; Maranta, Francesco; Iannaccone, Sandro; Cianflone, Domenico",Journal of ultrasound in medicine : official journal of the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/jum.15425; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32770687/,359
157732,Is COVID-19 spreading and curing silently: an observation of three family clusters in Bangladesh.,2020-09-09,"OBJECTIVE To assess the safety and efficacy of retrograde arterial recanalization of infrainguinal CTOs in the OBL setting. METHODS Consecutive patients who underwent interventions for lower extremity CTOs in the OBL setting by a single vascular surgeon were evaluated (January 2013-November 2017). If antegrade crossing was not possible, then a retrograde distal approach was used. Patient characteristics, CTO location, procedural time, contrast, anticoagulation and radiation doses and costs were recorded. Post-procedural complications were documented on post-procedure day 1 and 10-14 days post procedure. Three groups were compared: group 1-antegrade approach for femoropopliteal CTOs; group 2-antegrade approach for tibial CTOs, and; group 3-retrograde approach for femoropopliteal and tibial CTOs. RESULTS Two hundred and thirty-seven patients were studied. In 39 (16.5%), the lesions could not be crossed. A successful antegrade approach was used in 185 of them, of which 69% (group 1, n = 128) patients had femoropopliteal CTOs and 31% (group 2, n = 57) had tibial CTOs. Fourteen patients (5.9%, group 3) were treated by retrograde distal approach. Group 3 patients received higher contrast doses than groups 1 and 2 (p = 0.01). However, patients in groups 1 and 2 received similar contrast doses. Group 3 patients had the highest operative time and treatment costs followed by group 1 and then group 2 (p = 0.01). Three femoral pseudoaneurysms were noted in group 1, and 2 in group 2. No complications were seen in group 3. CONCLUSIONS Although the operative times, costs, radiation and contrast dose are higher with retrograde arterial access, it represents a safe and effective method for the crossing of CTO infrainguinal lesions in an ambulatory venue.","Leon, Luis R; Green, Courtney; Labropoulos, Nicos; Pacanowski, John P; Jhajj, Sandeep; Pandit, Viraj",Vascular and endovascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/1538574420968670; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33131462/,359

PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 100 cases of infants diagnosed with CHD combined with chronic heart failure in our hospital from July 2015 to July 2018 were selected as the experimental group, and 80 cases of healthy subjects underwent health examination in our hospital during the same period were selected as the control group. The levels of serum GDF-15 and β2-MG and LVEF index of the two groups were compared. The correlation analysis of GDF-15 and β2-MG levels and cardiac function classification was conducted. The diagnostic value of GDF-15 and β2-MG was analyzed by ROC curve. RESULTS The levels of GDF-15 and β2-MG were significantly higher in severe and moderate heart failure groups than those in mild heart failure group, and the levels were significantly higher in severe heart failure group than those in moderate heart failure group (p<0.001). Levels of GDF-15 and β2-MG in the experimental group were significantly higher than those in the control group (p<0.001) and the LVEF index in the experimental group was significantly lower than that in the control group (p<0.001). There was a positive correlation between levels of GDF-15 and β2-MG and the severity of heart failure. The sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of GDF-15 alone in diagnosis of CHD combined with chronic heart failure were respectively 91.25%, 74.00% and 0.821, those of β2-MG alone were 82.50%, 62.00% and 0.819, and those of GDF-15 combined with β2-MG were 82.50%, 82.00% and 0.888. In the prognosis, the sensitivity of GDF-15 and β2-MG was respectively 91.30%, 56.52%, specificity was 62.96%, 94.44%, and AUC was 0.806, 0.817. CONCLUSIONS Levels of GDF-15 and β2-MG are positively correlated with the severity of cardiac function, which can be used as an ideal indicator for early diagnosis of CHD combined with chronic heart failure, as well as a clinical indicator to judge the condition.","Zhou, X-J; Zhang, X; Zhang, J; Zhou, L; Zhou, T-T; Zhang, J-W",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202008_22494; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767337/,359

However, the injury rates vary among these structures in elbow screening of adolescent baseball players, despite being adjacent medial structures of the elbow. This study aimed to retrospectively determine the actual injury site and rate, and investigate the underlying reason for discrepancies anatomically and biomechanically. MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty-four male adolescent baseball players were scanned using MRI. Two interpreters independently and retrospectively assessed the ME, UCL-p, and UCL-d injuries using the gradient echo axial, sagittal, and coronal planes. RESULTS The injury prevalence was significantly higher in the ME and UCL-p (> 50% of the participants) than in the UCL-d (22.7%), P < 0.01 and P < 0.01, respectively. Additionally, there was a tendency toward a high-frequency injury rate of the ME or UCL-p. CONCLUSION The injury site of the medial structures tended to be proximal. The ME and UCL-p were observed to be more frequently injured compared to the UCL-d in adolescent baseball players according to the dedicated MRI findings in this study.","Yoshizawa, Tomohiro; Okamoto, Yoshikazu; Makihara, Takeshi; Tanaka, Kenta; Ogawa, Takeshi; Yamazaki, Masashi",Japanese journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11604-020-01048-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079316/,359
158716,Impact of COVID-19 on Clinical Research and Inclusion of Diverse Populations.,2020,"Importance Mind-body therapies (MBTs) are emerging as potential tools for addressing the opioid crisis. Knowing whether mind-body therapies may benefit patients treated with opioids for acute, procedural, and chronic pain conditions may be useful for prescribers, payers, policy makers, and patients. Objective To evaluate the association of MBTs with pain and opioid dose reduction in a diverse adult population with clinical pain. Data Sources For this systematic review and meta-analysis, the MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for English-language randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews from date of inception to March 2018. Search logic included (pain OR analgesia OR opioids) AND mind-body therapies. The gray literature, ClinicalTrials.gov, and relevant bibliographies were also searched. Study Selection Randomized clinical trials that evaluated the use of MBTs for symptom management in adults also prescribed opioids for clinical pain. Data Extraction and Synthesis Independent reviewers screened citations, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Meta-analyses were conducted using standardized mean differences in pain and opioid dose to obtain aggregate estimates of effect size with 95% CIs. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was pain intensity. The secondary outcomes were opioid dose, opioid misuse, opioid craving, disability, or function. Results Of 4212 citations reviewed, 60 reports with 6404 participants were included in the meta-analysis. Overall, MBTs were associated with pain reduction (Cohen d = -0.51; 95% CI, -0.76 to -0.26) and reduced opioid dose (Cohen d = -0.26; 95% CI, -0.44 to -0.08). Studies tested meditation (n = 5), hypnosis (n = 25), relaxation (n = 14), guided imagery (n = 7), therapeutic suggestion (n = 6), and cognitive behavioral therapy (n = 7) interventions. Moderate to large effect size improvements in pain outcomes were found for meditation (Cohen d = -0.70), hypnosis (Cohen d = -0.54), suggestion (Cohen d = -0.68), and cognitive behavioral therapy (Cohen d = -0.43) but not for other MBTs. Although most meditation (n = 4 [80%]), cognitive-behavioral therapy (n = 4 [57%]), and hypnosis (n = 12 [63%]) studies found improved opioid-related outcomes, fewer studies of suggestion, guided imagery, and relaxation reported such improvements. Most MBT studies used active or placebo controls and were judged to be at low risk of bias. Conclusions and Relevance The findings suggest that MBTs are associated with moderate improvements in pain and small reductions in opioid dose and may be associated with therapeutic benefits for opioid-related problems, such as opioid craving and misuse. Future studies should carefully quantify opioid dosing variables to determine the association of mind-body therapies with opioid-related outcomes.","Garland, Eric L; Brintz, Carrie E; Hanley, Adam W; Roseen, Eric J; Atchley, Rachel M; Gaylord, Susan A; Faurot, Keturah R; Yaffe, Joanne; Fiander, Michelle; Keefe, Francis J",JAMA internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2019.4917; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682676/,359
159019,Enhancing Kangaroo Mother Care Uptake Through Implementation of an Education Protocol.,2020-10-20,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE COPD exacerbation is characterized by worsening of symptoms, warranting change in treatment. Systemic and airway inflammation play roles in the pathogenesis of COPD exacerbation. We hypothesized whether increased serum inflammatory biomarkers are associated with the clinical outcomes of COPD exacerbation caused by different infectious pathogens. METHODS COPD patients with exacerbation were recruited from a hospital emergency department during 2014-2015. Serum procalcitonin (PCT) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured. Dyspnea, eosinopenia, consolidation, acidemia, and atrial fibrillation (DECAF) score was calculated for predicting mortality. Multiplex polymerase chain reaction was carried out for respiratory viral assay from nasopharyngeal swabs, and sputum bacterial culture was also performed. Hospital mortality, invasive mechanical ventilation requirement, and length of hospital stay (LOS) were evaluated, and their associations with clinical characteristics, DECAF score, and serum biomarkers were examined. RESULTS A total of 62 COPD patients were enrolled. These patients were classified as Global Initiative for Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 2, 3, and 4 in 12.9%, 6.4%, and 80.7% of cases, respectively. Isolated bacterial exacerbation was recovered in 30.6% of exacerbation episodes: Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most commonly identified bacteria. Viral pathogens and coinfections were noted in 9.6% and 16.1% of exacerbated patients, respectively. Influenza was the most commonly detected viral pathogen. Serum biomarkers and DECAF score for viruses, bacteria, coinfection, and noninfectious causes of exacerbations were similar. Neither DECAF score nor serum biomarkers were able to differentiate patients with and without mortality or requiring mechanical ventilation. Increased serum PCT was noted in patients with LOS ≥7 days when compared with those with LOS <7 days (0.38 ng/mL vs 0.1 ng/mL; P=0.035). CONCLUSION Increased serum PCT is associated with longer LOS in COPD exacerbation. However, CRP and DECAF score play limited roles in predicting clinical outcome and lack an association with causes of exacerbation.","Kawamatawong, Theerasuk; Apiwattanaporn, Apitch; Siricharoonwong, Warisara",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,https://doi.org/10.2147/copd.s132132; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28615935/,359

Nidus-type FTAVSs have rarely been reported, and the best treatment strategy is unclear. This is a report of 1 exceptional case of a nidus-type FTAVS and surgical treatment of the lesion. CASE DESCRIPTION The patient suffered from cauda equina syndrome for 9 months. Magnetic resonance imaging and spinal angiography revealed a nidus-type FTAVF at the L2 level. Surgical resection was performed in the hybrid operating room, and the nidus was completely resected with the assistance of intraoperative methylene blue angiography and neurophysiological monitoring. The postoperative neurological function was stable. CONCLUSIONS A nidus-type AVS could originate from the FT, and in such cases, complete surgical resection with intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring in a hybrid operating room should be suggested.","Xu, Jian-Kun; Ye, Ming; Yu, Jia-Xing; Zhang, Hong-Qi",The International journal of neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1080/00207454.2021.1924708; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33931000/,359

Practical training and development will further enhance the team ability to react to a series of low-frequency occurring adverse events during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). One of our specialized educational programs focuses on training the whole team. This training is based on an original animal simulation model. The objective of this pilot study was to assess our method of training and learning in an attempt to optimize and improve team management and functioning. METHODS Four members of the same cardiac surgery team joined our program. They performed a common procedure, with a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit set up to produce several adverse incidents. Events management was analyzed and debriefed in technical and non-technical perspectives. RESULTS Management of the adverse events was significantly improved. Discussion and debriefing time was fundamental in identifying the most appropriate management for each event. Rescue procedures were assimilated and team training was found to be effective, with the time reduced by up to 50% for 3 events and by up to 70% for air embolism. CONCLUSION Our pilot program is an innovative, low-cost tool for the improvement of the management of adverse events occurring during CPB. It includes the different components of surgical education and training. Such an educational tool might be relevant for training. To confirm those encouraging results, it should be assessed in a larger surgical team panel. Further investigations are required for assessing efficiency in real conditions.","Fouilloux, V; Gsell, T; Lebel, S; Kreitmann, B; Berdah, S",Perfusion,https://doi.org/10.1177/0267659113498922; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23863491/,359

We aimed to 1) implement a pilot of routine adolescent HIV screening in a pediatric ED and 2) determine the unique barriers to CDC recommended screening in this region of high HIV prevalence. METHODS This was a prospective four-month implementation of a routine HIV screening pilot in a convenience sample of adolescents 13-18 years at a single pediatric ED, based on study personnel availability. Serum-based 4th generation HIV testing was run through a central laboratory. Parents were allowed to remain in the room for HIV counseling and testing. Data were collected regarding patient characteristics and HIV testing quality metrics. Comparisons were made using chi square and Fisher's exact tests. Regression analysis was performed to assess for an association between parent presence at the time of enrollment and adolescent decision to participate in HIV screening. RESULTS Over four months, 344 of 806 adolescents approached consented to HIV screening (57% female, mean 15.1 years). Adolescents with HIV screening were more likely to be older than those who declined (p = 0.025). Other blood tests were collected with the sample for 21% of adolescents; mean time to result was 105 minutes (interquartile range 69, 123) and 79% were discharged before the result was available. Having a parent present for enrollment was not associated with adolescent participation (adjusted odds ratio 1.07, 95% CI 0.67-1.70). Barriers to testing included: fear of needlestick, time to results, cost, and staff availability. One of 344 tests was positive in a young adolescent with Stage 1 HIV. CONCLUSIONS Routine HIV screening in adolescents was able to be implemented in this pediatric ED and led to the identification of early infection in a young adolescent who would have otherwise been undetected at this stage of disease. Addressing the unique barriers to adolescent HIV screening is critical in high prevalence regions and may lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment in this vulnerable population.","Gutman, Colleen K; Duda, Elizabeth; Newton, Naomi; Alevy, Ryan; Palmer, Katherine; Wetzel, Martha; Figeroa, Janet; Griffiths, Mark; Koyama, Atsuko; Middlebrooks, Lauren; Simon, Harold K; Camacho-Gonzalez, Andres; Morris, Claudia R",Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/acem.14095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32717124/,359

The analysis established that vitamin D deficiency contributes both to higher risk of susceptibility to infectious agent and to negative impact to course and outcome of disease. The significant role of vitamin D in prevention and treatment of viral diseases is established. The international research studies confirm that at infectious diseases and early stages of COVID-19 protective immune response is responsible for elimination of the virus. Therefore, using vitamin D in treatment of COVID-19 is the strategy of immune protection. The authors consider that in case of infectious risks, preventive application of vitamin D is necessary. In case of initial manifestations of COVID-19, it is appropriate to promptly achieve levels of optimal status of micro-nutrient supply.","Mingazova, E N; Gureev, S A; Sidorov, V V","Problemy sotsial'noi gigieny, zdravookhraneniia i istorii meditsiny",https://doi.org/10.32687/0869-866x-2021-29-1-32-36; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33591652/,359

Spatiotemporal linear mixed models were used on city-day data from 22 US cities to estimate the associations between SDPs, traffic congestion and mobility. Autoregressive integrated moving average models with Fourier terms were then used on historical data to forecast expected 2020 NO2. Time series models were subsequently employed to measure how much reductions in local traffic congestion were associated with lower-than-forecasted 2020 NO2. Finally, the equity of NO2 pollution was assessed with community-level sociodemographics. When cities’ most stringent SDPs were implemented, they observed a 23.47 (95% CI: 18.82–28.12) percent reduction in average daily congestion and a 13.48 (95% CI: 10.36–16.59) percent decrease in average daily mobility compared to unrestricted days. For each standard deviation (8.38%) reduction in local daily congestion, average daily NO2 decreased by 1.37 (95% CI: 1.24–1.51) parts per billion relative to its forecasted value. Citizenship, education, and race were associated with elevated absolute NO2 pollution levels but were not detectibly associated with reductions in 2020 NO2 relative to its forecasted value. This illustrates the immediate behavioral and environmental impacts of local SDPs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Winchester, Alyse K.; Peterson, Ryan A.; Carter, Ellison Sammel Mary D.",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13137275,359

Telemedicine, fewer visits for lower acuity complaints, and decreased transmission of infectious illnesses have contributed. These factors however may have less impact on ED usage by very young children. Study Objective: To characterize the early impact of COVID-19 mitigation efforts on the volume, presenting complaints and clinical course of newborns presenting to a tertiary care PED. Methods: We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study of all visits by newborns, defined as children < 30 days of age, to a tertiary care PED in the U.S. during the onset of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. A state-wide shelter-at-home order was announced on 3/16/2020. Data abstracted from the electronic medical record during the 60-days following the order (3/16/2020-4/28/2020;study period) was compared to the same date range during 3 prior years (2017-2019;baseline period). Results: Of the 406 total newborn ED visits, 315 were in 2017-2019 (1.1% total ED volume for the baseline period) and 91 were in 2020 (2.3% total ED volume for the study period;P <.001). Mean age, insurance status and race distribution were unchanged;however, the study period proportion of Hispanic patients was significantly lower (27% vs 15.4%;P =.02).

167153,Happy hypoxia in COVID-19: pathophysiology and pulse oximetry accuracy,2021,"Extensive glycosylation of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus not only shields the major part of it from host immune responses, but glycans at specific sites also act on its conformation dynamics and contribute to efficient host receptor binding, and hence infectivity. As variants of concern arise during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is unclear if mutations accumulated within the spike protein would affect its site-specific glycosylation pattern. The Alpha variant derived from the D614G lineage is distinguished from others by having deletion mutations located right within an immunogenic supersite of the spike N-terminal domain that make it refractory to most neutralizing antibodies directed against this domain. Despite maintaining an overall similar structural conformation, our mass spectrometry-based site-specific glycosylation analyses of similarly produced spike proteins with and without the D614G and Alpha variant mutations reveal a significant shift in the processing state of N-glycans on one specific N-terminal domain site. Its conversion to a higher proportion of complex type structures is indicative of altered spatial accessibility attributable to mutations specific to the Alpha variant that may impact its transmissibility. This and other more subtle changes in glycosylation features detected at other sites provide crucial missing information otherwise not apparent in the available cryogenic electron microscopy-derived structures of the spike protein variants.","Kuo, Chu-Wei; Yang, Tzu-Jing; Chien, Yu-Chun; Yu, Pei-Yu; Hsu, Shang-Te Danny; Khoo, Kay-Hooi",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.21.453140,359

Incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity suggest a contribution of additional genetic lesions to clinical manifestations and outcome. Some monogenic disorders may therefore actually be digenic. However, only a few digenic disorders have been reported, all discovered by candidate gene approaches applied to at least one locus. We propose here a novel two-locus genome-wide test for detecting digenic inheritance in WES data. This approach uses the gene as the unit of analysis and tests all pairs of genes to detect pairwise gene x gene interactions underlying disease. It is a case-only method, which has several advantages over classic case-control tests, in particular by avoiding recruitment and bias of controls. Our simulation studies based on real WES data identified two major sources of type I error inflation in this case-only test: linkage disequilibrium and population stratification. Both were corrected by specific procedures. Moreover, our case-only approach is more powerful than the corresponding case-control test for detecting digenic interactions in various population stratification scenarios. Finally, we validated our unbiased, genome-wide approach by successfully identifying a previously reported digenic lesion in patients with craniosynostosis. Our case-only test is a powerful and timely tool for detecting digenic inheritance in WES data from patients. Significance statement Despite a growing number of reports of rare disorders not fully explained by monogenic lesions, digenic inheritance has been reported for only 54 diseases to date. The very few existing methods for detecting gene x gene interactions from next-generation sequencing data were generally studied in rare-variant association studies with limited simulation analyses for short genomic regions, under a case-control design. We describe the first case-only approach designed specifically to search for digenic inheritance, which avoids recruitment and bias related to controls. We show, through both extensive simulation studies on real WES datasets and application to a real example of craniosynostosis, that our method is robust and powerful for the genome-wide identification of digenic lesions.","Kerner, Gaspard; Bouaziz, Matthieu; Cobat, Aurélie; Bigio, Benedetta; Timberlake, Andrew T; Bustamante, Jacinta; Lifton, Richard P; Casanova, Jean-Laurent; Abel, Laurent",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.06.936922,359

The NM shape in the conformal circuit is tuned by mixing nanowires (NW) with nanoflakes (NF) or nanospheres (NS) at different mixing ratios. The change in line resistance post-forming and post-sintering for any given mixing ratio is studied in greater depth using SEM characterization, UV-Vis spectrophotometry and thermal measurements.

Many data analysis methods for cytometry data focus solely on identifying subpopulations via clustering and testing for differential cell abundance.

Here, we systematically evaluated existing and novel approaches for differential expression analysis on real and simulated CyTOF data. We found that methods using median marker expressions compute fast and reliable results when the data is not strongly zero-inflated. Methods using all data detect changes in strongly zero-inflated markers, but partially suffer from overprediction or cannot handle big datasets. We present a new method, CyEMD, based on calculating the Earth Mover’s Distance between expression distributions that can handle strong zero-inflation without being too sensitive.

The Auto industry was an ideal crucible in which to explore the interface of public health with business given the confluence of the different domains in this sector. The substantial benefits of mobility, especially for the under-resourced, sit alongside negative impacts from emissions, accidents, products and services. Through interviews with 65 senior executives from seven major automakers, corporate actions reflecting health as a strategic agenda were mapped to the Culture of Health model. While most of the companies did not use the language of health explicitly in their strategy, key examples were present across all four pillars. Given the future of mobility relies on the interface of human experience with technology, it is a population-level challenge demanding system-level changes. Ostensibly, a framework for sustainability, the Culture of Health model could help the Auto industry navigate the disruption caused by the global megatrends and changing societal expectations of business in society and transition successfully to a new mobility economy.","Purcell, Wendy M.; Feldman, Brian S.; Finn, Molly Spengler John D.",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13073924,359

This study examined whether individual differences in students' capacity to adjust to situational uncertainty and novelty (i.e., adaptability) explained differences in their achievement-related emotions and learning outcomes in the digital learning context. We assessed 89 university students' trait-level adaptability at the beginning of the 2020 spring semester, mid-semester achievement emotions (joy, hope, anxiety, hopelessness), and end-of-semester perceived learning and knowledge test scores. Controlling for prior digital learning experience, structural equation modeling revealed adaptability to be positively related to hope, and negatively related to anxiety and hopelessness. Anxiety was also negatively related to end-of-semester test scores, and indirectly linked adaptability and test scores. Hopelessness indirectly linked adaptability and perceived learning.

Most of the global population live in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), which have historically received a small fraction of global resources for mental health. The COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly in many of these countries. This Review examines the mental health implications of the COVID-19 pandemic in LMICs in four parts. First, we review the emerging literature on the impact of the pandemic on mental health, which shows high rates of psychological distress and early warning signs of an increase in mental health disorders. Second, we assess the responses in different countries, noting the swift and diverse responses to address mental health in some countries, particularly through the development of national COVID-19 response plans for mental health services, implementation of WHO guidance, and deployment of digital platforms, signifying a welcome recognition of the salience of mental health. Third, we consider the opportunity that the pandemic presents to reimagine global mental health, especially through shifting the balance of power from high-income countries to LMICs and from narrow biomedical approaches to community-oriented psychosocial perspectives, in setting priorities for interventions and research. Finally, we present a vision for the concept of building back better the mental health systems in LMICs with a focus on key strategies;notably, fully integrating mental health in plans for universal health coverage, enhancing access to psychosocial interventions through task sharing, leveraging digital technologies for various mental health tasks, eliminating coercion in mental health care, and addressing the needs of neglected populations, such as children and people with substance use disorders. Our recommendations are relevant for the mental health of populations and functioning of health systems in not only LMICs but also high-income countries impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with wide disparities in quality of and access to mental health care.

173266,Hepatic Encephalopathy Linked to COVID-19 in a Pediatric Case: A Rare Presentation of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Doctors must be able to quickly and accurately assess clinical condition of patients, especially in the emergency rooms. An easy scoring system but producing meaningful clinical conclusions is the reason for creating various scoring systems. It includes a scoring system for predicting the admission status of patients. AIM: The aim of the study was to determine the diagnostic value of pediatric observational priority score (POPS) and early warning scoring system (EWSS) to predicting admission status of pediatric patients in the emergency department. METHODS: Diagnostic tests for POPS and EWSS were done to predict the admission status of pediatric patients in the emergency department of Haji Adam Malik general hospital from May to October 2020. Subjects aged 1 month–18 years were excluded if they left the emergency department before assessment, had trauma cases, died, inpatients due to social indications, and patients who came only to continue therapy were also excluded from the study. POPS and EWSS assessments were carried out by the researcher and the admission status of the patients was determined by the doctor in charge in the emergency department. RESULTS: There were 119 children meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria. POPS score ≥3 had sensitivity 82.65%, specificity 85.71%, and area under curve (AUC) 0.88 (p < 0.001). EWSS score ≥2 had sensitivity 83.67%, specificity 71.43%, and AUC 0.83 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: POPS and EWSS had good diagnostic values in predicting the admission status of pediatric patients in the emergency department. POPS has a slightly higher diagnostic value than EWSS.","Wati, L.; Malisie, R. F.; Harahap, J.",Open Access Macedonian Journal of Medical Sciences,https://doi.org/10.3889/oamjms.2021.6311,359

A search for stellar streams with Gaia DR2 and EDR3 with follow-up from ESPaDOnS and UVES,2020-12-09,"On March 16th 2020, the Croatian government mandated a nationwide closure of schools and introduced remote teaching and learning in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study explores the perspectives of pupils in the 7th grade of elementary education regarding this period of remote teaching and learning. The study aims to examine the level and determinants of pupils' satisfaction with newly implemented practices and to explore their perception of remote teaching and learning in comparison to classroom practices. An online survey was conducted with 920 pupils from 23 elementary schools in Zagreb between May 25th and June 6th 2020. The results indicate average satisfaction levels and a weak ability of the model to predict pupils' satisfaction based on a set of individual pupil characteristics. Pupils' interest in using digital devices and fathers' educational status were the only significant predictors of satisfaction. On average, pupils perceived remote teaching and learning as unfavourable in terms of quality, task load and effort in comparison to classroom practices. There was, however, a small cluster of pupils (15%) who associated remote teaching and learning with higher-quality practices. © 2021, Institute of Social Sciences Ivo Pilar.

This problem is exacerbated further when using unsupervised clustering approaches where differences are not observed in clear cluster structure and therefore many important differences between two biological states go entirely unseen. Here, we develop DA-seq, a powerful unbiased, multi-scale algorithm that uniquely detects and decodes novel DA subpopulations not restricted to well separated clusters or known cell types. We apply DA-seq to several publicly available scRNA-seq datasets on various biological systems to detect differences between distinct phenotype in COVID-19 cases, melanomas subjected to immune checkpoint therapy, embryonic development and aging brain, as well as simulated data. Importantly, we find that DA-seq not only recovers the DA cell types as discovered in the original studies, but also reveals new DA subpopulations that were not described before. Analysis of these novel subpopulations yields new biological insights that would otherwise be neglected.","Zhao, Jun; Jaffe, Ariel; Li, Henry; Lindenbaum, Ofir; Sefik, Esen; Jackson, Ruaidhrí; Cheng, Xiuyuan; Flavell, Richard; Kluger, Yuval",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/711929,359
175334,"Rotavirus and adenovirus infections in children during COVID-19 outbreak in Hangzhou, China",2021,"The leukotriene receptor antagonist Montelukast (MTK) is an approved medication for the treatment of asthma and allergic rhinitis. The existing marketed tablet forms of MTK exhibit inconsistent uptake and bioavailability, which partially explains the presence of a significant proportion of MTK low- and non-responders in the population. Besides that, tablets are suboptimal formulations for patients suffering of dysphagia, for example seen in COVID-19 patients or in patients with neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s Disease. The increasing interest in repurposing of MTK for the treatment of such patients and the need for an improved bioavailability triggered us to reformulate MTK. The aim was to develop a mucoadhesive MTK film with a good safety and improved pharmacological, i.e. improved bioavailability, profile in humans as well as in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s Disease. We tested dissolution of the mucoadhesive film containing MTK in saliva buffer and assessed pharmacoexposure and −kinetics after acute and chronic oral application in mice. Furthermore, we performed a Phase I safety / bioavailability / pharmacokinetic analysis in healthy volunteers. The latter included a comparison with the marketed tablet form as well as a quantitative analysis of the MTK levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. The novel MTK film demonstrated significantly improved bioavailability compared to the marketed tablet in the clinical phase 1a study in healthy humans. Furthermore, there were measurable amounts of MTK present in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at the 3.0 and 7.0 hour time points post drug administration in humans. In mice, MTK was detected in serum and CSF after acute and chronic exposure in a dose-dependent manner. The developed mucoadhesive film of MTK represents a promising alternative for the tablet delivery. The oral film might lower the non-responder rate in patients with asthma and might be an interesting product for repurposing of MTK in other diseases. As we demonstrate BBB penetrance in a preclinical model as well as in a clinical study, the oral film of MTK might find its use as a therapeutic for acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as dementias and stroke.","Michael, Johanna; de Sousa, Diana Bessa; Conway, Justin; Gonzales-Labrada, Erick; Obeid, Rodolphe; Tevini, Julia; Felder, Thomas; Hutter-Paier, Birgit; Zerbe, Horst; Paiement, Nadine; Aigner, Ludwig",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.11.06.371500,359

175657,Do estrogen antagonists and anti-androgens prevent the COVID-19's pulmonary involvement?,2020,"The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is arranged as a trimer on the virus surface, composed of three S1 and three S2 subunits. Infected and vaccinated individuals generate antibodies against spike, which can neutralize the virus. Most antibodies target the receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD) of S1; however, antibodies against other regions of spike have also been isolated. The variation between infected individuals in domain specificity of the antibodies and in their relative neutralization efficacy is still poorly characterized. To this end, we tested serum and plasma samples from 85 COVID-19 convalescent subjects using 7 immunoassays that employ different domains, subunits and oligomeric forms of spike to capture the antibodies. Samples were also tested for their neutralization of pseudovirus containing SARS-CoV-2 spike and of replication-competent SARS-CoV-2. We observed strong correlations between the levels of NTD- and RBD-specific antibodies, with a fixed ratio of each type to all anti-spike antibodies. The relative potency of the response (defined as the measured neutralization efficacy relative to the total level of spike-targeting antibodies) also exhibited limited variation between subjects, and was not associated with the overall amount of anti-spike antibodies produced. Accordingly, the ability of immunoassays that use RBD, NTD and different forms of S1 or S1/S2 as capture antigens to estimate the neutralizing efficacy of convalescent samples was largely similar. These studies suggest that host-to-host variation in the polyclonal response elicited against SARS-CoV-2 spike is primarily limited to the quantity of antibodies generated rather than their domain specificity or relative neutralization potency. IMPORTANCE Infection by SARS-CoV-2 elicits antibodies against various domains of the spike protein, including the RBD, NTD and S2. Different infected individuals generate vastly different amounts of anti-spike antibodies. By contrast, as we show here, there is a remarkable similarity in the properties of the antibodies produced. Different individuals generate the same proportions of antibodies against each domain of the spike protein. Furthermore, the relationship between the amount of anti-spike antibodies produced and their neutralization efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 is highly conserved. Therefore, the observed variation in the neutralizing activity of the antibody response in COVID-19 convalescent subjects is caused by differences in the amounts of antibodies rather than their recognition properties or relative antiviral activity. These findings suggest that COVID-19 vaccine strategies that focus on enhancing the overall level of the antibodies will likely elicit a more uniformly efficacious protective response.","Van Ert, Hanora A.; Bohan, Dana W.; Rogers, Kai; Fili, Mohammad; Rojas Chávez, Roberth A.; Qing, Enya; Han, Changze; Dempewolf, Spencer; Hu, Guiping; Schwery, Nathan; Sevcik, Kristina; Ruggio, Natalie; Boyt, Devlin; Pentella, Michael A.; Gallagher, Tom; Jackson, J.

The objective is to bring together potential proinflammatory mechanisms of COVID-19 pathogenesis and address mitigation strategies using naturally occurring compounds and FDA-approved drugs. Outstanding questions addressed include the following: What is the mechanistic basis for linking enhanced vulnerability in COVID-19 to increased oxidative damage and proinflammatory mediators (e.g., cytokines), especially in high-risk people? Can we repurpose anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory agents to mitigate inflammation in COVID-19 patients? How does 2-deoxy-d-glucose function as an anti-COVID drug? COVID-19, cancer biology, and immunotherapy share many mechanistic similarities. Repurposing drugs that already have been FDA-approved for mitigating inflammation and immunosuppression in cancer may be a way to counteract disease severity, progression, and chronic inflammation in COVID-19. What are the long-term effects of reactive oxygen species-inducing immune cells and sustained inflammation in so-called long-haulers (long COVID) after recovery from COVID-19? Can we use mitochondria-targeted agents prophylactically to prevent inflammation and boost immunity in long-haulers? Addressing the oxidative chemical biology of COVID-19 and the mechanistic commonalities with cancer may provide new insights potentially leading to appropriate clinical trials and new treatments.","Kalyanaraman, B.",Rsc Chemical Biology,https://doi.org/10.1039/d1cb00042j,359

This study aims to show the performance of the global crude oil market amid Covid-19 and spillover relations with other asset classes. Design/methodology/approach: The authors employ various pandemic outbreak indicators to show the overreaction of the crude oil market due to Covid-19 infection. The analysis also presents market connectedness and spillover relations between the crude oil market and other asset classes. Findings: One of the essential findings the authors report is that the crude oil market remains more responsive to pandemic fake news. The shock of the global pandemic panic index and pandemic sentiment index appears to be more promising. It has also been noticed that the energy trader's sentiment (OVX and OIV) was measured at a too high level within the Covid-19 outbreak. Volatility spillover analysis shows that crude oil and other market are closely connected, and the total connectedness index directs on average 35% contribution from spillover. During the initial growth of the infection, other macroeconomic and political events remained to favor the market. The second phase amidst the pandemic outbreak harms the global crude oil market. The authors find that infectious diseases increase investor panic and anxiety. Practical implications: The crude oil investors' sentiment index OVX indicates fear and panic due to infectious diseases and lack of hedge funds to protect energy investments. The unparalleled overreaction of the investors gauged in OVX indicates market participants have paid an excessive put option (protection) premium over the contagious outbreak of the infectious disease.

Design and setting UK wide longitudinal qualitative study comprising online interviews and focus groups with email follow-up. Method 50 participants were recruited from a previous qualitative study of the lived experience of long Covid (n = 23) and online support groups for people with persistent neurological problems following Covid-19 (n = 27). In remotely held focus groups, participants were invited to describe their cognitive symptoms and comment on others accounts. Individuals were followed up by email 4-6 months later. Data were audiotaped, transcribed, anonymised and coded in NVIVO. They were analysed by an interdisciplinary team with expertise in general practice, clinical neuroscience, the sociology of chronic illness and service delivery, and checked by three people with lived experience of brain fog. Results 84% of participants were female and 60% were White British ethnicity. Most had never been hospitalised for Covid-19. Qualitative analysis revealed the following themes: mixed views on the appropriateness of the term brain fog; rich descriptions of the experience of neurocognitive impairments (especially executive function, attention, memory and language), accounts of how the illness fluctuated, and in some but not all cases, resolved, over time; the profound psychosocial impact of the condition on relationships, personal and professional identity; self-perceptions of guilt, shame and stigma; strategies used for self-management; challenges accessing and navigating the healthcare system; and participants search for physical mechanisms to explain their symptoms.

It is observed that there is a rampant rise in the rate of infection in spite of best possible precautionary measures taken into consideration against Corona. As there is no scientifically validated full proofed medicine against COVID-19 till date, the only possible way is prevention against this infection by improving self-immunity, mass immunisation and controlling non-communicable diseases, if suffered from. Another possible way from the prevention from this deadly virus is development of herd immunity, but the process takes time and can be fatal for people with higher age groups and with co-morbidities. Yoga, an Indian way of mind-body purification, has been reported to improve functionality of human physiological systems and to prevent diseases. It is also observed that yoga, being a low to moderate intensity physical activity, breathing maneuvers and meditation, can also be performed by any person irrespective of age, with maximum benefit and having less stress in the vital organs during the practice. Therefore, a yoga package for improving immunity and other physical and physiological capacities and mental function to prevent Corona like disease has been formulated on the basis of knowledge from traditional yogic literature and evidence from available research publications on yoga.

This study aims to overview the cycling phenomenon during the Covid-19 Pandemic and the factors causing the cycling trend during a pandemic. In addition, the main highlight is to determine the emergence background of the cycling trend;whether it is an increase in people's awareness of sports or is it merely a lifestyle trend? The research method uses a systematic literature review by conducting literature reviews in reputable journals and scientific publications that discuss cycling in the pre-pandemic and pandemic times. Data analysis uses descriptive analysis and phenomenological approach as a theoretical framework. The results showed that four factors caused the cycling trend during the pandemic. Those factors are health, environment, media and lifestyle factors. Health reasons are due to the desire to maintain health and body immunity, and cycling is a sport recommended by health experts and according to the principle of physical distancing. Environmental factors are caused by being economical and environmentally friendly, supporting the ""go green"" program, and cyclist could get fresh and clean air. The media factor is driven by the significant influence of social media content and hashtags about cycling. While lifestyle factors arise due to following the latest trends, cycling can relieve stress and increase social status indicated by the price of bicycles and reasons for conformity in social groups. The increasing trend of cycling is mainly motivated by the desire to accompany the social demands of the current lifestyle, while the motivation related to health factors to increase body immunity in dealing with pandemic situations is secondary motivation.

179318,The drop in reported invasive pneumococcal disease among adults during the first COVID-19 wave in the Netherlands explained.,2021-07-03,"The COVID-19 situation has created an exceptional challenge in the power management system (PMS). This work mainly focuses on the load management through load forecasting. Power generation and distribution is the most important part of PMS. Accurate load forecasting can help to secure electricity scheduling, supply, and reduce the wastage of power. Right now, social distancing has created a great challenge to the administrators to run the power system efficiently and uninterruptedly with minimum involvement of human. In the sector of load management, it can be done through a proper and faster load forecasting approach. Electrical Load Forecasting through deep learning algorithm can perform an effective role in Power Management System (PMS). In this research real data is collected from West Zone Power Distribution Company Limited (WZPDCL) and meteorological data like temperature and humidity are collected from the website of Bangladesh Meteorological Department to train and forecast electrical load using MATLAB. Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Feed Forward Back Propagation (FFBP) and ELMAN Neural Network (NN) are used to forecast electrical load. As exogenous data, the load factor (L.F.), power factor (P.F.), current and temperature were used to train algorithms in forecasting the electrical load. A comparative analysis is shown to indicate which is the best suitable method for load forecasting of WZPDCL. Electrical load forecasting results are evaluated through Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). In this research for short-term electrical load forecasting, Feed Forward Back Propagation has shown a minimum RMSE value. © 2021 IEEE.","Saha, B.; Ahmed, K. F.; Saha, S.; Islam, M.

Being least organised and lacking institutional support, domestic workers are extremely vulnerable to exploitation and human rights violations, and the pandemic has aggravated the situation. Telephonic interviews were conducted with 260 domestic workers from three cities, namely Delhi, Mumbai and Kochi with focus on working conditions, livelihood and household dynamics, health scenario and state support during the pandemic. The data was substantiated with qualitative inputs from in-depth interviews conducted with 12 domestic workers across the cities. In the results, widespread job loss is reported among domestic workers during March?June 2020 along with drastically reduced income and increased workload. About 57% domestic workers reported stigma and discrimination at workplace, and 40% worked without any safety measures. Incidence of domestic violence at home, increased work burden at home, issues in access to health care, etc., were reported. The study findings point out the urgent need to have a national-level policy and state support specifically targeting women domestic workers, without which the situation of poverty, health hazards and social exclusion will continue to exist.JEL Code: J4, J46","Sumalatha, B.

179681,"Searching for vitamin C, vitamin D and COVID-19: a Google Trends study",2021,"Background: In COVID-19, the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Acute infections are accompanied by a sickness symptom complex (SSC) which is a highly conserved symptom complex that protects against infections and hyperinflammation. Aims: To examine the associations of COVID-19, SSC and the NLPR3 rs10157379 T>C and NLPR3 rs10754558 C>G SNV variants; and the protective role of SSC in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 infection. Methods: We recruited COVID-19 patients, 308 with critical, 63 with moderate and 157 with mild disease. Results: Increased SSC protects against SARS, critical disease, and death due to COVID-19. Increasing age, male sex and rs10754558 CG significantly predict reduced SSC protection. The rs10157379 CT and rs10754558 GG genotypes are positively associated with SARS. Partial Least Squares analysis shows a) that 41.8% of the variance in critical COVID-19 symptoms could be explained by SSC and oxygen saturation (inversely associated), and inflammation, chest computed tomography abnormalities, increased body mass index, SARS and age (positively associated); and b) the effects of the NLRP3 rs10157379 and rs10754558 variants on critical COVID-19 are mediated via SSC (protective) and SARS (detrimental). SSC includes anosmia, dysgeusia and gastrointestinal symptoms. Conclusions: Intersections among the rs10754558 variant, age, and sex increase risk towards critical COVID-19 by attenuating SSC. NLRP3 variants play an important role in SARS, and severe and critical COVID-19 especially in individuals with reduced SSC, elderly people, and those with increased BMI, hypertension, and diabetes type 2. SSC is a new drug target to combat acute COVID-19.","Maes, M.; Del Tedesco Junior, W. L.; Lozovoy, M.; Mori, M.; Danelli, T.; de Almeida, E.; Tejo, A.; Tano, Z.; Reiche, E. M.; Simao, A.

This resulted, as a consequence, in a remodelling of the lifestyle;in this scenario the correct nutrition combined with regular physical activity becomes fundamental for health. Although the sedentary lifestyle of a few weeks involves risks such as lowering the immune system, it favours overweight and obesity, high blood pressure, metabolic disorders, depression and anxiety, and in some subjects they react to the risk of onset of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other diseases. The importance of healthy lifestyle is crucial to prevent also viral infection. Indeed, as reported by many data literature, during lung infections, IL-6 and TNF-a create the pathway between adipose tissue and lung system demonstrating the important involvement of adipose tissue in lung diseases. In obese condition, adipose tissue endocrine function is altered. There is an imbalance in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-a and anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10. In the light of these evidences, the immune response is influenced by nutritional status and by physical activity which are able to reduce pro-inflammatory mediators and increase anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10. In addition, the power of viral infection is influenced by host predisposition.

(a 14-year-old girl with newly diagnosed gpa after covid-19 infection),2021,"Food addiction (FA) has a long-term impact on the health of individuals. This study analyses the changes in FA and related behaviour in India in the wake of lockdown which started on 25th March 2020 as a response to the COVID-19 outbreak. This paper provides insight into the food consumption behavior of various segments of the population during this lockdown. It offers some new insights in this regard by establishing the relationship between a temporary pause in the consumption of palatable food and FA. This study was conducted between March and May 2020 in two stages. First, a quantitative study used the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) to identify food addicts from a sample of 150 respondents. In the second stage, in-depth telephone interviews were conducted with the food addicts;the responses were recorded, transcribed, and analysed to ascertain the changes in their overall consumption and addiction behavior towards palatable foods. This was done by conducting a thematic analysis with the help of the NVivo software where various tools like word cloud and cluster analysis were used. This study found that COVID-19 restrictions had significantly brought down the addiction to palatable food in India as the regular consumption chain had got broken during the lockdown. The consumption of palatable food is expected to remain low for a brief period after the lockdown due to hygiene issues like improper or lack of sanitization and cleanliness. However, in the long-run, the consumption of palatable food is expected to rise in India owing to its growing population, modernisation, increasing disposable income and changes in customer preferences. These findings have significant implications for the food, packaging and health industries as the changes in customer behavior will certainly impact them, and they need to duly change their strategy to adapt to the changes promptly.","Das, A.; Bharti, N.; Malik, S.","African Journal of Food, Agriculture, Nutrition and Development",https://doi.org/10.18697/ajfand.101.20615,359

Such unexpected or catastrophic events have rendered households vulnerable and resulted in poor health outcomes. Given this background, we intend to analyze the nutritional profile of households for a period spanning almost a decade using the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES). We construct a composite nutrition deficiency index (NDI), capturing intake of 14 different macro- and micronutrients (which we refer to as dimensions) - namely, calories, protein, calcium, zinc, folate, thiamine, niacin, iron, vitamin A, vitamin B12, vitamin D, vitamin B6, vitamin C, and vitamin E - using the popular Alkire-Foster methodology. This methodology, usually used to construct multidimensional poverty indexes, in this case helps measure the incidence, intensity, and combined extent of multinutrient deprivation. DRC's values on the multidimensional NDI vary regionally from 0.13 to 0.73. Urban DRC performs worse than rural DRC. Regions subject to the conflict and Ebola crises are the worst-affected of the nutritionally deprived regions. Deficiency in calorie and protein intake contributes to the highest values of the NDI, but we also find evidence of a double burden of malnutrition, with households lacking consumption of both macro- and micronutrients. South Kivu is the worst-performing of all regions and Mongala the best. The northern parts of DRC have fewer nutritionally deprived households, as compared with the central and southwestern parts. Our main policy recommendation is to help improve market access in urban areas so that people consume a more diverse diet. In rural areas, the government should support improving nutrition-sensitive agricultural production. Although the World Food Programme has a sustained presence in the country, uplifting households from severe hunger, active participation by the government and collaboration with multiple stakeholders is called for.","Mirindi, P.

These events affected not only the way education is delivered but also the overall school community's wellbeing and cohesion. In this paper, we present a playful education platform originally designed to promote sustainable mobility in schools that has been adapted to support distance learning and community engagement during the health emergency. In the original version of the platform, the home-school distances traveled by students with sustainable means contributed to the advancement of the whole class in a collective virtual trip associated with playful learning material. Conversely, in a revised version of the platform adapted to the new context, students could advance in the virtual trip by reporting the good deeds performed at home. Findings from 161 questionnaires completed by teachers, families, and students, as well as results from online workshops with students, and the analysis of log files at the end of the school year revealed the opportunities and limitations of converting a playful activity conceived for being experienced in class into an online activity to be completed at home. The results show that the adapted version contributed to the school community cohesion and provided a positive experience to all its members, even though it was not able to completely overcome the generalized feeling of isolation.

Methods: We identified 26,117 COVID-19 positive patients from the Mass General Brigham's electronic health records (EHR) and extracted 328,879 clinical notes from their post-acute infection period (day 51-110 from first positive COVID-19 test). The PASC symptom lexicon incorporated Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Metathesaurus concepts and synonyms based on selected semantic types. The MTERMS natural language processing (NLP) tool was used to automatically extract symptoms from a development dataset. The lexicon was iteratively revised with manual chart review, keyword search, concept consolidation, and evaluation of NLP output. We assessed the comprehensiveness of the lexicon and the NLP performance using a validation dataset and reported the symptom prevalence across the entire corpus. Results: The PASC symptom lexicon included 355 symptoms consolidated from 1,520 UMLS concepts. NLP achieved an averaged precision of 0.94 and an estimated recall of 0.84. Symptoms with the highest frequency included pain (43.1%), anxiety (25.8%), depression (24.0%), fatigue (23.4%), joint pain (21.0%), shortness of breath (20.8%), headache (20.0%), nausea and/or vomiting (19.9%), myalgia (19.0%), and gastroesophageal reflux (18.6%). Discussion and Conclusion: PASC symptoms are diverse. A comprehensive PASC symptom lexicon can be derived using a data-driven, ontology-driven and NLP-assisted approach. By using unstructured data, this approach may improve identification and analysis of patient symptoms in the EHR, and inform prospective study design, preventative care strategies, and therapeutic interventions for patient care.","Wang, L.; Foer, D.; MacPhaul, E.; Lo, Y.-C.; Bates, D.

ICT based learning methods have been widely applicable to this date. The study has been conducted to investigate the level of technologies used by instructors, assessment criteria for teachers in distance learning environment, challenges faced by instructors in terms of the integration of teaching technology and lastly challenges faced by students in distance learning programs in Lebanon. In order to investigate these specific objectives, a study has been conducted where primary data has been gathered using questionnaires distributed electronically amongst a sample of 90 students and 90 teachers, using random sampling methods with an adequate ethical consent. Data gathered from questionnaires has been analyzed using descriptive statistics and frequency distribution using Ms Excel. Findings of the study suggest that students in Lebanon are facing numerous issues during their transition from conventional learning to e-learning including accessibility to Internet, Computer, Learning Resources (e.g. Books and Curriculum), Electricity (e.g. Load shedding), Seating Arrangements at Home (e.g. chair, desk, table) and noise distraction at home (e.g. dog barking, child crying). Furthermore, findings suggest that challenges faced by teachers include communicating with school management, electricity disruption, noise distraction challenge, children's participation in online classes, confusion when assessing students' performance, difficulties using ICT based technology, frequent communication with parents, attention distraction and lack of personalized attention. Findings of this study pose significant recommendations for the ministry of education and for school authorities to overcome these issues. Copyright © 2021. Chirine Khalil NASSAR.

The study employed the exploratory mixed-method triangulation design and analyzed the data gathered from 3, 989 respondents composed of students and faculty members. It was found out that during school lockdowns, the teachers made adjustments in teaching and learning designs guided by the policies implemented by the institution. Most of the students had difficulty complying with the learning activities and requirements due to limited or no internet connectivity. Emerging themes were identified from the qualitative responses to include the trajectory for flexible learning delivery, the role of technology, the teaching and learning environment, and the prioritization of safety and security. Scenario analysis provided the contextual basis for strategic actions amid and beyond the pandemic. To ensure teaching and learning continuity, it is concluded that higher education institutions have to migrate to flexible teaching and learning modality recalibrate the curriculum, capacitate the faculty, upgrade the infrastructure, implement a strategic plan and assess all aspects of the plan. © Copyright © 2021 Dayagbil, Palompon, Garcia and Olvido.","Dayagbil, F.

185037,Outpatient Management of COVID-19: Rapid Evidence Review.,2020-10-15,"This paper presents an efficient coronavirus optimization algorithm (CVOA) to find the optimal values of the PID controller to track a preselected reference speed of a brushless DC (BLDC) motor under several types of disturbances. This work simulates how the coronavirus (COVID-19) spreads and infects healthy people. The initial values of PID controller parameters consider the zero patient, who infects new patients (other values of PID controller parameters). The model aims to simulate as accurately as possible the coronavirus activity. The CVOA has two major advantages compared to other similar strategies. First, the CVOA parameters are already adjusted according to disease statistics to prevent designers from initializing them with arbitrary values. Second, the approach has the ability to finish after several iterations where the infected population initially grows at an exponential rate. The proposed CVOA was investigated with well-known optimization techniques such as the genetic algorithm (GA) and Harmony Search (HS) optimization. A multi-objective function was used to allow the designer to select the desired rise time, the desired settling time, the desired overshoot, and the desired steady-state error. Several tests were performed to investigate the obtained proper values of PID controller parameters. In the first test, the BLDC motor was exposed to sudden load at a steady speed. In the second test, the continuous sinusoidal load was applied to the rotor of the BLDC motor. In the third test, different operating points of reference speed were selected to the rotor of the BLDC motor. The results proved that the CVOA-based PID controller has the best performance among the techniques. In the first test, the CVOA-based PID controller has a minimum rise time (0.0042 s), minimum settling time (0.0079 s), and acceptable overshoot (0.0511%). In the second test, the CVOA-based PID controller has the minimum deviation about the reference speed (±4 RPM). In the third test, the CVOA-based PID controller can accurately track the reference speed among other techniques.","Shamseldin, Mohamed A.",Algorithms,https://doi.org/10.3390/a14070193,359

Telementorship, mentorship through video conferencing software, presents a unique approach to overcome these challenges. AIMS: This study evaluated whether telementorship through video conference increased access to mentorship encounters and decreased perceived barriers to access, factors that determine likelihood to maintain mentor relationships, and quality of mentorship. METHODS: A year-long randomized, prospective cohort study was conducted in 2016–2017 with pairs of resident mentors from seven different training programs and medical student mentees, randomized to telementorship or in-person mentorship. The number of quarterly encounters was monitored and demographic predictors of meeting were determined. Likert scale survey responses were analyzed with linear regression. RESULTS: Forty-three of 46 (93.5%) volunteer mentor-mentee pairs participated. Telementorship did not alter likelihood of meeting or attitudes toward mentorship barriers (time and distance). Mentee satisfaction increased from 42.5% to 65.4% (P<0.05) throughout the year. Operating room-based practice (P<0.05) and higher postgraduate level (P=0.02) decreased the likelihood of meeting. CONCLUSION: Telementorship provided an equal number of encounters compared to the pairs who were asked to meet in-person. Telementorship may serve as an adjunct modality for flexible communication.

In most cases, the signs and symptoms of thyroid deficiency generally resolve, which is particularly gratifying for the treating physician and mainly, for patients. However, there may be coexisting special situations that can potentially hinder or interfere with a successful treatment, as in the case of the elderly, patients suffering from heart disease, hematological diseases or dyslipidemia, hypothyroid patients who will undergo an emergency surgery, those with chronic kidney failure, or adrenal insufficiency, among others. Besides management of hypothyroidism in time of COVID-19 is also included. Some patients may experience intolerance to treatment and others persistent symptoms of hypothyroidism even under adequate replacement therapy, requiring a special approach.

It was found that the prescription I possessed obvious inhibitory effects on the UV induction of lambda-lysogen, the inhibitory rate reaching 83.87%. Among five medicinal herbs prescribed in that formula, Herba Patriniae, Radix Astragali and Radix Glycyrrhizae played important roles. When these three herbs were eliminated from the recipe separately, the inhibitory effects were prominently decreased. If only one of these five medicinal herbs was added into the medium of lambda-lysogen, the inhibitory rates ranged from 27.0% approximately 45.0%. By electron spin resonance (ESR) detection, we found that the prescription I, Herba Patriniae and other main herbs in that recipe, could quench effectively the free radicals generated in the process of lambda-lysogenic cells by UV. These results provide a novel idea for further studying the pharmacology of TCM and exploring the mechanism of SARS virus infection.","Li, Yaqiong; Li, Jing; Fang, Chengxiang",The American journal of Chinese medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16437747/,359

Most studies suggest that though mild derangements of liver function may be experienced by most COVID-19 patients but significant liver injury is not common. The aim of this study was to describe clinical characteristics of COVID-19 patients admitted to this level 4 COVID hospital and find out their relation to the liver parameters. Materials and Methods COVID-19 patients admitted in this level -4 COVID hospital during the study period were classified as mild (Group 1,n=42), moderate (Group 2,n=40) and severe (Group 3,n=35) cases as per national guidelines. Serum samples were analyzed using biochemistry autoanalyzer. Serum levels of total and direct bilirubin, Alanine Transaminase (ALT) and Aspartate Transaminase (AST), Alkaline Phosphatase (ALKP), total protein and albumin were assayed. Results Patients with higher BMI (Body mass index) had developed greater COVID-19 related complications and hence had to be admitted either in HDU (Group 2) or in ICU (Group 3) set up. Total and direct serum bilirubin levels were normal and almost similar in the various study groups. The primary liver enzymes ALT and AST were raised in the entire study population. However differences between the study groups were statistically insignificant. ALKP was within normal reference range for all the cases. Serum total Protein levels were within normal physiological limits in all the three groups. However serum albumin levels were reduced significantly in Groups 3 and 2 in comparison to Group 1. Conclusion Derangements of LFT in COVID-19 Patients are common especially in patients with severe disease but its long term impact is unknown. Hence, further investigation and long term follow up of recovered COVID-19 cases is warranted to understand the pathophysiology and implication of liver injury that occurs both in overt and covert forms during infection.","Mukherjee, Kheya; Banerjee, Abhra; Bhattacharjee, Debojyoti; De, Suparna; Biswas, Ajay; Garai, Debanjan; Chakraborty, Roopsa; Manna, Asis",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33527805/,359

Moreover, very few studies have examined the effect of blood type on severity of COVID-19 infection. METHODS This was a retrospective, single-center analysis of adult patients with COVID-19 infection who were hospitalized between March 8th to July 31st, 2020 at a regional tertiary care hospital. All patients who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) infection and had a documented ABO blood type were enrolled in this analysis. Aims of this study were to examine the prevalence of ABO blood types in patients with COVID-19 infection and to determine the frequency of severe COVID-19 infection among ABO blood types. RESULTS A total of 227 cases were identified. Our cohort had a mean age of 63.3 years and 60% were males. The most common blood type was O (49%) followed by A (36%), which was similar to the prevalence of ABO blood types in our regional population. Moreover, there was no significant difference in the frequency of severe COVID-19 infection between ABO blood types (O: 50%, A: 53%, B: 56%, AB: 57%; P=0.93), or any additional outcomes including in-hospital mortality rate (P=0.72), need for ICU admission (P=0.66), ICU free days at day 28 (P=0.51), hospital free days at day 28 (P=0.43), or need for acute renal replacement therapy (P=0.09). CONCLUSION We did not find an increased susceptibility of any blood type to COVID-19 infection, nor was there an increased risk of severe COVID-19 infection in any ABO blood types.","Mullins, Jeannette; Al-Tarbsheh, Ali Hani; Chieng, Hau; Chaukiyal, Pooja; Ghalib, Sana; Jain, Esha; Dawani, Om; Santelises Robledo, Fabiana Maria; Chong, Woon H; Feustel, Paul J; Subik, Kristina; Chopra, Amit",American journal of blood research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33796389/,359
191054,Micro and Macro Ethical Considerations of COVID-19.,2020,"OBJECTIVE The aim of the research is to identify specific of AI in healthcare, its nature, and specifics and to establish complexities of AI implementation in healthcare and to propose ways to eliminate them. PATIENTS AND METHODS Materials and methods: This study was conducted during June-October of 2020. Through a broad literature review, analysis of EU, USA regulation acts, scientific researches and opinions of progressive-minded people in this sphere this paper provide a guide to understanding the essence of AI in healthcare and specifics of its regulation. It is based on dialectical, comparative, analytic, synthetic and comprehensive methods. RESULTS Results: One of the first broad definitions of AI sounded like ""Artificial Intelligence is the study of ideas which enable computers to do the things that make people seem intelligent ... The central goals of Artificial Intelligence are to make computers more useful and to understand the principles which make intelligence possible."" There are two approaches to name this technology - ""Artificial intelligence"" and ""Augmented Intelligence."" We prefer to use a more common category of ""Artificial intelligence"" rather than ""Augmented Intelligence"" because the last one, from our point of view, leaves much space for ""human supervision"" meaning, and that will limit the sense of AI while it will undoubtedly develop in future. AI in current practice is interpreted in three forms, they are: AI as a simple electronic tool without any level of autonomy (like electronic assistant, ""calculator""), AI as an entity with some level of autonomy, but under human control, and AI as an entity with broad autonomy, substituting human's activity wholly or partly, and we have to admit that the first one cannot be considered as AI at all in current conditions of science development. Description of AI often tends to operate with big technological products like DeepMind (by Google), Watson Health (by IBM), Healthcare's Edison (by General Electric), but in fact, a lot of smaller technologies also use AI in the healthcare field - smartphone applications, wearable health devices and other examples of the Internet of Things. At the current stage of development AI in medical practice is existing in three technical forms: software, hardware, and mixed forms using three main scientific-statistical approaches - flowchart method, database method, and decision-making method. All of them are useable, but they are differently suiting for AI implementation. The main issues of AI implementation in healthcare are connected with the nature of technology in itself, complexities of legal support in terms of safety and efficiency, privacy, ethical and liability concerns. CONCLUSION Conclusion: The conducted analysis makes it possible to admit a number of pros and cons in the field of AI using in healthcare. Undoubtedly this is a promising area with a lot of gaps and grey zones to fill in. Furthermore, the main challenge is not on technology itself, which is rapidly growing, evolving, and uncovering new areas of its use, but rather on the legal framework that is clearly lacking appropriate regulations and some political, ethical, and financial transformations. Thus, the core questions regarding is this technology by its nature is suitable for healthcare at all? Is the current legislative framework looking appropriate to regulate AI in terms of safety, efficiency, premarket, and postmarked monitoring? How the model of liability with connection to AI technology using in healthcare should be constructed? How to ensure privacy without the restriction of AI technology use? Should intellectual privacy rights prevail over public health concerns? Many questions to address in order to move in line with technology development and to get the benefits of its practical implementation.","Pashkov, Vitalii M; Harkusha, Andrii O; Harkusha, Yevheniia O",Wiadomosci lekarskie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33611272/,359

Even so, many hospitals have been offering vaccination for their HCWs for some years. Nonetheless, uptake has remained low. We conducted a survey to determine predictors for vaccine uptake and to clarify the attitude of Danish HCWs towards employer-sponsored influenza vaccination. METHODS An online questionnaire covering demographics, uptake of and thoughts about the influenza vaccine was distributed by e-mail to hospital staff. Analyses identifying factors associated with vaccine uptake were conducted. RESULTS The response rate was 28% with 3,130 HCWs participating. Overall, 51% had received influenza vaccination. Formerly vaccinated participants were more likely to be vaccinated again. Perception of own gain, patient gain and a workplace recommendation were key incentives for vaccine uptake. The main reported reasons for rejecting vaccination were perceiving immunisation as a private matter, not feeling vulnerable to influenza and fear of vaccine side effects. Women, participants ≤ 49 years and participants with children living at home were less likely to be vaccinated. CONCLUSIONS To improve influenza vaccine uptake among HCWs, campaigns targeting newly employed staff should be conducted thereby establishing the basis for future vaccination behaviour. Efforts should be made to increase vaccine acceptance among women, younger employees and nursing staff. FUNDING none.

Today, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people are staying home for longer periods of times, thus being exposed to a poor indoor air quality. Due to elevated numerical concentration and large surface area, the health effect of sub-10 nm particles can go beyond what expected from their low mass concentration in the atmosphere. The objective of this study is to find, based on analysis of recent in vitro studies, a dose-effect correlation based on particle size/surface more than on particle mass. Such a correlation cold be useful to assess the health effects of people exposed to very low mass doses of nanoparticles either indoor or outdoor.","Pedata, Paola",Giornale italiano di medicina del lavoro ed ergonomia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33600643/,359

This article documents disparities in access to health services in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), using a framework incorporating quality, geographic accessibility, availability, financial accessibility, and acceptability of services. Whereas the poor in LMICs are consistently at a disadvantage in each of the dimensions of access and their determinants, this need not be the case. Many different approaches are shown to improve access to the poor, using targeted or universal approaches, engaging government, nongovernmental, or commercial organizations, and pursuing a wide variety of strategies to finance and organize services. Key ingredients of success include concerted efforts to reach the poor, engaging communities and disadvantaged people, encouraging local adaptation, and careful monitoring of effects on the poor. Yet governments in LMICs rarely focus on the poor in their policies or the implementation or monitoring of health service strategies. There are also new innovations in financing, delivery, and regulation of health services that hold promise for improving access to the poor, such as the use of health equity funds, conditional cash transfers, and coproduction and regulation of health services. The challenge remains to find ways to ensure that vulnerable populations have a say in how strategies are developed, implemented, and accounted for in ways that demonstrate improvements in access by the poor.","Peters, David H; Garg, Anu; Bloom, Gerry; Walker, Damian G; Brieger, William R; Rahman, M Hafizur",Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17954679/,359

Newer dietary approaches combining cholesterol-lowering foods may offer another option, but these approaches have not been compared directly with statins in the same persons. OBJECTIVE The objective was to compare, in the same subjects, the cholesterol-lowering potential of a dietary portfolio with that of a statin. DESIGN Thirty-four hyperlipidemic participants underwent all three 1-mo treatments in random order as outpatients: a very-low-saturated-fat diet (control diet), the same diet plus 20 mg lovastatin (statin diet), and a diet high in plant sterols (1.0 g/1000 kcal), soy-protein foods (including soy milks and soy burgers, 21.4 g/1000 kcal), almonds (14 g/1000 kcal), and viscous fibers from oats, barley, psyllium, and the vegetables okra and eggplant (10 g/1000 kcal) (portfolio diets). Fasting blood samples were obtained at 0, 2, and 4 wk. RESULTS LDL-cholesterol concentrations decreased by 8.5+/-1.9%, 33.3+/-1.9%, and 29.6+/-1.3% after 4 wk of the control, statin, and portfolio diets, respectively. Although the absolute difference between the statin and the portfolio treatments was significant at 4 wk (P=0.013), 9 participants (26%) achieved their lowest LDL-cholesterol concentrations with the portfolio diet. Moreover, the statin (n=27) and the portfolio (n=24) diets did not differ significantly (P=0.288) in their ability to reduce LDL cholesterol below the 3.4-mmol/L primary prevention cutoff. CONCLUSIONS Dietary combinations may not differ in potency from first-generation statins in achieving current lipid goals for primary prevention. They may, therefore, bridge the treatment gap between current therapeutic diets and newer statins.","Jenkins, David J A; Kendall, Cyril W C; Marchie, Augustine; Faulkner, Dorothea A; Wong, Julia M W; de Souza, Russell; Emam, Azadeh; Parker, Tina L; Vidgen, Edward; Trautwein, Elke A; Lapsley, Karen G; Josse, Robert G; Leiter, Lawrence A; Singer, William; Connelly, Philip W",The American journal of clinical nutrition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15699225/,359

Public health control measures are the cornerstones in the fight against COVID-19 in the absence of an effective vaccine or proven treatment. The aim of this review was to explore the historical use case of various public health measures adopted today to tackle COVID-19 spread. Although our knowledge about this novel coronavirus transmission is evolving over time, the fundamental non-pharmaceutical interventions e.g., handwashing, wearing a mask, physical distancing, isolation, quarantine and border control which are adopted globally at present are not new. This review highlighted that historically and religiously similar approaches were practised in the medieval past for controlling disease outbreaks. The successful implementation of the public health control measures largely depends on health systems resilience, community engagement and changes in population behaviour. Combined global efforts are essential to strengthen health systems, improve the capability of research and transparent information sharing with both public and international bodies to combat the pandemic.","Das, M C; Islam, N; Hasan, M; Khanam, F; Alam, A; Akter, A; Khan, M H; Rahman, K S; Khan, A; Das, D",Mymensingh medical journal : MMJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33830144/,359

Insomnia is often related to exposure to stressful situations, such as the current health crisis, as well as other mental disorders, physical conditions and work-related problems. The objectives of this systematic review were: 1) to examine the impact of the current health pandemic produced by COVID-19 on insomnia and sleep quality of health professionals, and 2) to identify risk factors associated with insomnia. After a literature search in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO, 18 relevant studies were identified. The prevalence of insomnia estimated by random effects meta-analysis was 38% (95%CI= 37 to 39%), being slightly higher in women (29%, 95%CI= 27% to 30%) than in men (24%, 95%CI= 21 to 27%). The main risk factor associated with insomnia was working in a high-risk environment, followed by female sex and having a lower educational level. The high figures of self-reported insomnia and poor sleep quality observed indicate the need to develop interventions aimed at mitigating and caring for the mental health of healthcare workers fighting against this pandemic.","Serrano-Ripoll, María J; Zamanillo-Campos, Rocío; Castro, Adoración; Fiol-de Roque, María A; Ricci-Cabello, Ignacio",Actas espanolas de psiquiatria,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34195971/,359

The results of these analyses combined with earlier data on the orientation and protease sensitivity of E1 assembled in microsomal membranes lead to a topological model. According to this model, the protein is anchored in the lipid bilayer by three successive membrane-spanning helices present in its N-terminal half whereas the C-terminal part is thought to be associated with the membrane surface; these interactions with the membrane protect almost the complete polypeptide against protease digestion. In addition, it is predicted that the insertion of E1 into the membrane occurs by the recognition of the internal transmembrane region(s) as a signal sequence.","Rottier, P J; Welling, G W; Welling-Wester, S; Niesters, H G; Lenstra, J A; Van der Zeijst, B A",Biochemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3008826/,359

201829,COVID-19: An unforgettable challenge for the neurology community,2021,"BACKGROUND Humans have faced 3 major influenza pandemics in the 20th century. In recent years, it has become evident that domestic poultry play an important role in the generation of novel influenza strains with the capacity to cross the species barrier and infect and kill humans at an alarming rate. There is particular concern that avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype could cause a pandemic. METHODS A better understanding of the genetic factors that lead to interspecies transmission is essential to prevent the emergence of influenza pandemics. In addition, the stockpiling of antiviral drugs and development of vaccines against potentially pandemic viruses must be considered under the umbrella of pandemic plans. RESULTS The world is ill-prepared to face an influenza pandemic. Only a handful of countries have developed influenza pandemic plans, and even fewer are developing vaccines or stockpiling antiinfluenza drugs to ameliorate the impact of a potential pandemic. Currently the major undertaking in several at risk nations is to implement effective control measures to stop the spread of the virus at its source, that is, avian species. These measures include the culling of domestic poultry to contain the virus, a practice that could eventually bring these countries to a financial and social breaking point. CONCLUSIONS Avian influenza disease is preventable in humans and birds with the concerted effort of governments and poultry producers, large and small, to improve biosecurity and education programs. Pandemic plans can reduce the impact of the pandemic; however, preventing avian influenza in poultry can avert a pandemic altogether.","Perez, Daniel R; Sorrell, Erin M; Donis, Ruben O",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16378048/,359
202076,Detection of Bacterial Coinfection in COVID-19 Patients Is a Missing Piece of the Puzzle in the COVID-19 Management in Indonesia,2021,"Nasal and small intestinal mucosae are the first sites of contact with infectious agents and the sites of T-cell-mediated and secreted immunoglobulin A (IgA)-mediated defences against pathogens. We investigated the factors controlling the infiltration of CD3(+) T lymphocytes and surface IgA(+) (sIgA(+)) B lymphocytes into swine epithelium and lamina propria (LP) within and between these two mucosal effector sites. Vascular addressins, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 were reciprocally expressed in both mucosae. Strong expression of alpha(4)beta(1) relative to alpha(4)beta(7) was characteristic of CD3(+) T cells in nasal mucosa LP and epithelium and of sIgA(+) cells in nasal mucosa epithelium. The same profile was observed on corresponding blood cells. Conversely, higher levels of integrins beta(7) and alpha(4)beta(7) than alpha(4)beta(1) were characteristic of CD3(+) T cells and sIgA(+) cells in the small intestine. However, about 40% of the LP-activated sIgA(+) cells displayed sIgA(high), integrin alpha(4) and integrin alpha(4) expression. Whereas CCL19, CXCL12, CCL21 and CCL28 messenger RNAs were similarly expressed in both mucosae, CCL25 messenger RNA was only expressed in the small intestine. Thus, the nasal and small intestine mucosae represent separate compartments for infiltration by CD3(+) T cells and sIgA(+) effector cells, with the exception of a population of small intestine activated sIgA(+) cells, which may gain access to both mucosae.","Bourges, Dorothée; Chevaleyre, Claire; Wang, CaiHong; Berri, Mustapha; Zhang, XiaoMei; Nicaise, Laetitia; Meurens, François; Salmon, Henri",Immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17635614/,359

The Polish-language International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) was used to assess physical activity and the level of Internet addiction was tested using the Kimberly Young Questionnaire. Results: The respondents mostly suffered from pain originating in the cervical spine. In the study group, only every fifth person had a high level of physical activity. Sex differentiates the level of the measures considered. Sitting in front of the computer affects the pain in the spine. Conclusions: Research results suggest that the pandemic is negatively affecting students. Frequent occurrence of back pain is observed with a simultaneous low level of physical activity. Maintaining regular activity during a pandemic, at least at home, is an indispensable preventive measure for physical health.","Galczyk, Monika; Zalewska, Anna; Bialokoz-Kalinowska, Irena; Sobolewski, Marek",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,359

205404,"A commentary on ""A comparative overview of COVID-19, MERS and SARS: Review article""",2021,"The approval of two mRNA vaccines as urgent prophylactic treatments against Covid-19 made them a realistic alternative to conventional vaccination methods. However, naked mRNA is rapidly degraded by the body and cannot effectively penetrate cells. Vectors capable of addressing these issues while allowing endosomal escape are therefore needed. To date, the most widely used vectors for this purpose have been lipid-based vectors. Thus, we have designed an innovative vector called LipoParticles (LP) consisting of poly(lactic) acid (PLA) nanoparticles coated with a 15/85 mol/mol DSPC/DOTAP lipid membrane. An in vitro investigation was carried out to examine whether the incorporation of a solid core offered added value compared to liposomes alone. To that end, a formulation strategy that we have named particulate layer-by-layer (pLbL) was used. This method permitted the adsorption of nucleic acids on the surface of LP (mainly by means of electrostatic interactions through the addition of LAH4-L1 peptide), allowing both cellular penetration and endosomal escape. After a thorough characterization of size, size distribution, and surface charge- and a complexation assessment of each vector-their transfection capacity and cytotoxicity (on antigenic presenting cells, namely DC2.4, and epithelial HeLa cells) were compared. LP have been shown to be significantly better transfecting agents than liposomes through pLbL formulation on both HeLa and DC 2.4 cells. These data illustrate the added value of a solid particulate core inside a lipid membrane, which is expected to rigidify the final assemblies and makes them less prone to early loss of mRNA. In addition, this assembly promoted not only efficient delivery of mRNA, but also of plasmid DNA, making it a versatile nucleic acid carrier that could be used for various vaccine applications. Finally, if the addition of the LAH4-L1 peptide systematically leads to toxicity of the pLbL formulation on DC 2.4 cells, the optimization of the nucleic acid/LAH4-L1 peptide mass ratio becomes an interesting strategy-essentially reducing the peptide intake to limit its cytotoxicity while maintaining a relevant transfection efficiency.","Ayad, Camille; Libeau, Pierre; Lacroix-Gimon, Céline; Ladavière, Catherine; Verrier, Bernard",,,359
205482,Should we tackle the oral cavity to stop the spread of COVID-19?,2020,"Within the Dutch hegemonic discourse, the ""migrant other"" is portrayed as almost incompatible with ""national culture"" while it is simultaneously pressured to assimilate. This creates paradoxes for the queer refugee participants in this study. When these refugees assimilate, they risk reinforcing the dominant discourse considering their group as the ""backward other"". When they do not assimilate, they are considered not ""properly"" Dutch. This paper explores how queer refugee artists can unsettle such dominant exclusionary discourses through exilic (art) narratives. Their experiences of exilic positioning (being neither there nor here) and queer liminality (e.g., nonbinary gender identifications) and their intersectional positionalities situate these artists in various ""states of in-betweenness"". Although these states may be challenging, this paper shows how they can also stimulate agency. Inspired by a feminist approach, this study aimed to co-create knowledge with rather than about participants, focusing on creativity and resilience. Methods included biographical interviews and an arts-informed component in which participants were invited to create artistic works concerning their experiences during COVID-19 for an online platform. This study shows how the research participants challenge hegemonic discourses at various levels, using multiple modes of reflection and creation while engaging with their in-between situatedness. At the individual level, they challenge discourses by exploring (or performing) their non-conforming queer positioning through their art practices. At the communal level, plural reflexivity is triggered via art shared within and outside the community. At the societal level, queer refugees exercise activism creatively through images, songs or performances.","Holle, F.; Rast, M. C.; Ghorashi, H.",Frontiers in Sociology,,359

The scientific community strongly responded to this emergency situation with massive research efforts, mostly focused on diagnosis and clinical investigation of therapeutic solutions. In this scenario, drug repurposing played a crucial role in accelerating advanced clinical testing and shortening the time to access the regulatory review. Areas covered : This review covers the main and most successful drug repurposing approaches from a design, clinical, and regulatory standpoint. Available patents on repurposed drugs are also discussed. Expert opinion : Drug repurposing proved highly successful in response to the current pandemic, with remdesivir becoming the first specific antiviral drug approved for the treatment of COVID-19. In parallel, a number of drugs such as corticosteroids and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are used to treat hospitalized COVID-19 patients, while clinical testing of additional therapeutic options is ongoing. It is reasonably expected that these research efforts will deliver optimized and specific therapeutic tools that will increase the preparedness of health systems to possible future epidemics.","Cusinato, Jacopo; Cau, Ylenia; Calvani, Anna Maria; Mori, Mattia",,,359

The patient presented to the Department of Dermatology for a 3âweek duration of an extremely pruritic erythematous-squamous lesion, initially on the trunk and upper limbs, with extension to the lower limbs in the last week and the lesion respected the cephalic extremity, palms, and soles. One week before the rash, respiratory tract infection symptomatology was observed by the patient. At home, she underwent systemic treatment with antihistamines and topical medication with dermatocorticosteroids. The evolution was unfavorable, with the spread of the lesions and the accentuation of the pruritus. DIAGNOSES: Considering the actual epidemiological context, we performed a real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay from nasal and pharyngeal swabs for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to investigate the PR etiology. The patient had a positive RT-PCR result, and was confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment was initiated with systemic corticosteroid therapy - hydrocortisone hemisuccinate 200âmg/day for 7âdays, and loratadine 10âmg 2 times a day. Also, topical medication with dermatocorticosteroids and emollients was associated. OUTCOME: Under the treatment that was initiated a partial remission of the lesions after 7âdays was observed. LESSONS: Our reported case adds to the other findings regarding the association of PR with SARS-CoV-2 infection, in the context of the pandemic, suggesting the need to test patients with PR skin lesions for SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Birlutiu, Victoria; Birlutiu, Rares Mircea; Iancu, Gabriela Mariana",Medicine (Baltimore),,359

207956,Status of the Current COVID-19 Vaccine Candidates: Implications in the Saudi Population,2020,"Abstract Introduction Frontline COVID-19 healthcare workers (FLHCWs) are at a high-risk of suffering occupational stress- and trauma-related mental health problems, including burnout and compassion fatigue (B&CF). Given the time limitations (due to their heavy workloads) and need to minimize face-to-face interventions (in order to avoid contagions), psychological interventions for FHCWs should be as brief and remote as possible. Objective To evaluate the usability and clarity of evidence-based psycho-educational videos to prevent B&CF, to deal with uncooperative, hostile, and anxious patients and relatives, and to use personal protective equipment (PPE), from the perspective of Mexican FLHCWs. Method Based on a convenience sampling by intensity approach, videos were distributed requesting feedback based on specific questions through WhatsApp to FLHCWs. Field notes were used to triangulate the information. Results Content analysis of feedback from a final sample of 24 participants &#8210;75% women, 42 ± 8.4 years old&#8210; yielded three general thematic categories and seven subthemes: 1. content evaluation, which included three subthemes: utility, pertinence, and practicality; 2. dissemination and other needs, with two subcategories: willingness to share and receive more videos (other needs); and 3. format aspects, also comprising two subthemes: attractiveness and duration. All participants found the videos content very beneficial, relevant, and applicable to the workplace and even in their everyday personal and family life, and were willing to share them and to receive more videos on other issues, including strategies to manage problems related to isolation. Discussion and conclusion Escalation of this remote preventive intervention to other COVID-19 centers and future similar epidemics is recommended.","Robles, Rebeca; Palacios, Marcela; Rangel, Nancy; Real, Tania; Becerra, Benjamín; Fresán, Ana; Vega, Hamid; Rodríguez, Evelyn; Durand, Sol; Madrigal, Eduardo",Salud ment,,359

208225,Evidence for systematic autopsies in COVID-19 positive deceased: Case report of the first German investigated COVID-19 death,2020,"BACKGROUND: We previously reported that lymphocytopenia and T cell exhaustion is notable in acute COVID19 patients, especially in aged and severe cases. Thymosin alpha 1 (T&#945;1) had been used in the treatment of viral infections as an immune response modifier for many years. However, clinical benefits and mechanism of T&#945;1 supplement to COVID-19 are still unclear. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes of 76 severe cases with COVID-19 admitted into two hospitals in Wuhan from December 2019 to March 2020. The thymus output in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from COVID-19 patients was measured by T cell receptor excision circles (TREC). The levels of T cell exhaustion markers PD-1 and Tim-3 on CD8+ T cells were detected by flow cytometry. RESULTS: Compared with untreated group, T&#945;1 treatment significantly reduces mortality of severe COVID-19 patients (11.11% vs. 30.00%, p=0.044). T&#945;1 timely enhances blood T cell numbers in COVID-19 patients with severe lymphocytopenia (the counts of CD8+ T cells or CD4+ T cells in circulation lower than 400/µL or 650/µL, respectively). Under such conditions, T&#945;1 also successfully restores CD8+ and CD4+ T cell numbers in aged patients. Meanwhile, T&#945;1 reduces PD-1 and Tim-3 expression on CD8+ T cells from severe COVID-19 patients in comparison with untreated cases. It is of note that restoration of lymphocytopenia and acute exhaustion of T cells are roughly parallel to the rise of TRECs. CONCLUSIONS: T&#945;1 supplement significantly reduce mortality of severe COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 patients with the counts of CD8+ T cells or CD4+ T cells in circulation lower than 400/µL or 650/µL, respectively, gain more benefits from T&#945;1. T&#945;1 reverses T cell exhaustion and recovers immune reconstitution through promoting thymus output during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Liu, Yueping; Pang, Yue; Hu, Zhenhong; Wu, Ming; Wang, Chenhui; Feng, Zeqing; Mao, Congzheng; Tan, Yingjun; Liu, Ying; Chen, Li; Li, Min; Wang, Gang; Yuan, Zilin; Diao, Bo; Wu, Yuzhang; Chen, Yongwen",Clin. infect. dis,,359

Data regarding multidrug resistant (MDR) Candida species in COVID-19 patients is scarce, and nonexistent regarding Candida duobushaemulonii superinfections. CASE DESCRIPTION: A 34-year-old male presented to our institution with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) due to COVID-19 infection and developed Candida duobushaemulonii fungemia after multiple courses of antibiotics and prolonged mechanical ventilation. He died after recurrent pneumothorax led to respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. DISCUSSION: Bacterial and fungal infections are common complications of viral pneumonia in critically ill patients. Data regarding these infections in COVID-19 patients has been poorly studied with only a few cases reporting secondary infection, mostly without identifying specific pathogens. Prolonged hospital stays, invasive interventions (central venous catheter, mechanical ventilation), and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics in COVID-19 infections could carry a high risk of bacterial and/or fungal superinfections. CONCLUSION: Strategies to improve outcome in COVID-19 ICU patients should include early recognition of candidemia and appropriate antifungal therapy.","Awada, Bassem; Alam, Walid; Chalfoun, Maria; Araj, George; Bizri, Abdul Rahman",J Mycol Med,,359

Recently OTT service providers are extending their service to video broadcasting. As a one type of video broadcasting, this paper covers multimedia streaming with multiple sources. Multimedia streaming with multiple sources has multiple sources, and receivers can select one specific source to watch the video from the source. Sources include cameras capturing different angles of same event or location, cameras in geographical locations, etc. For delivering video to rapidly increasing number of users, multimedia streaming with multiple sources system needs efficient and scalable delivery method. Tree-based Peer-to-peer (P2P) networking has been investigated as the delivery solution of multimedia streaming with multiple sources, and set-top boxes or mobile apps of OTT service can be used as peers connecting the subscriber of OTT service. However, the scalability of the tree-based P2P networking is limited by the out-degree of a tree that branches linearly with the number of users. Hence, this study proposes clustering peers based on the location proximity of the peers to enhance the scalability of the P2P multimedia streaming with multiple sources. By clustering peers, one or more peers can be grouped into a virtual peer with an aggregated uplink/downlink capacity. This paper describes P2P multimedia streaming with multiple sources and algorithms for the proposed clustering method. Two applications which are one-view multiparty video conferencing and multi-view video streaming are introduced, and considerations for applying the proposed method to the applications are also discussed. The experimental results show that location-proximity-based clustering is effective in achieving a scalable P2P multimedia streaming with multiple sources by reducing the out-degree of a tree for the introduced applications. The proposed clustering leads improvement in the maximum achievable video bit rate, the average viewing video bit rate, and perceived delay.","Lee, Changkyu; Kang, Shin-Gak; Nayyar, Anand",Multimed Tools Appl,,359

Seven hundred eighteen female pre-school teachers with children who worked online at home participated in the study. Female pre-school teachers reported that the COVID-19 has increased work overload and parenting stress. Moreover, work overload was negatively associated with job satisfaction via its positive association with work-to-family conflict. Parenting stress was negatively associated with job satisfaction via both family-to-work conflict and work-to-family conflict. The study contributes to a better understanding of the association among female pre-school teachers' work overload, parenting stress, work-family conflict, and job satisfaction. Our findings highlighted potential avenues for interventions aimed at balancing female pre-school teachers' work and family and improving their job satisfaction during the COVID-19.","Hong, X.; Liu, Q.; Zhang, M.",Frontiers in Psychology,,359
212639,The optimal medical therapy for glycemic control in covid-19,2021,"Vaccines are being rapidly developed with the goal of ending the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. However, the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 vaccination induces serum responses that cross-react with other coronaviruses remains poorly studied. Here we define serum profiles in rhesus macaques after vaccination with DNA or Ad26 based vaccines expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein followed by SARS-CoV-2 challenge, or SARS-CoV-2 infection alone. Analysis of serum responses showed robust reactivity to the SARS-CoV-2 full-length Spike protein and receptor binding domain (RBD), both included in the vaccine. However, serum cross-reactivity to the closely related sarbecovirus SARS-CoV-1 Spike and RBD, was reduced. Reactivity was also measured to the distantly related common cold alpha-coronavirus, 229E and NL63, and beta-coronavirus, OC43 and HKU1, Spike proteins. Using SARS-COV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 lentivirus based pseudoviruses, we show that neutralizing antibody responses were predominantly SARS-CoV-2 specific. These data define patterns of cross-reactive binding and neutralizing serum responses induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination in rhesus macaques. Our observations have important implications for understanding polyclonal responses to SARS-CoV-2 Spike, which will facilitate future CoV vaccine assessment and development.ImportanceThe rapid development and deployment of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines has been unprecedented. In this study, we explore the cross-reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody responses to other coronaviruses. By analyzing responses from NHPs both before and after immunization with DNA or Ad26 vectored vaccines, we find patterns of cross reactivity that mirror those induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection. These data highlight the similarities between infection and vaccine induced humoral immunity for SARS-CoV-2 and cross-reactivity of these responses to other CoVs.","Jacob-Dolan, Catherine; Feldman, Jared; McMahan, Katherine; Yu, Jingyou; Zahn, Roland; Wegmann, Frank; Schuitemaker, Hanneke; Schmidt, Aaron G; Barouch, Dan H",J. virol,,359

This paper presents the findings from a study that was conducted to evaluate whether air quality index (AQI), three primary pollutants (PM2.5, PM10 and CO), Ground level ozone (O3) and three meteorological variables (temperature, relative humidity, wind speed) have promoted the COVID-19 transmission in five megacities of India. The results show significant correlation of PM2.5, PM10, CO, O3 concentrations, AQI and meteorological parameters with the confirmed cases and deaths during the lockdown period. Among the meteorological variables considered, temperature strongly correlated with the COVID-19 cases and deaths during the lockdown (r=0.54;0.25) and unlock period (r=0.66;0.25). Among the pollutants, ozone, and among the meteorological variables, temperature, explained the highest variability, up to 34% and 30% respectively, for COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. AQI was not a significant parameter for explaining the variations in confirmed and death cases. WS and RH could explain 10-11% and 4-6% variations of COVID-19 cases. A GLM model could explain 74% and 35% variability for confirmed cases and deaths during the lockdown and 66% and 19% variability during the unlock period. The results suggest that meteorological parameters may have promoted the COVID-19 incidences, especially the confirmed cases. Our findings may encourage future studies to explore more about the role of ambient air pollutants and meteorology on transmission of COVID-19 and similar infectious diseases.","Kolluru, Soma Sekhara Rao; Patra, Aditya Kumar; Shiva Nagendra, S M",Environ Res,,359

Depending on the extent of the outbreak, there may be insufficient capacity to provide ventilator support to all of those in need. As part of a larger conceptual framework for determining need for and allocation of ventilators during a public health emergency, this article focuses on the strategies to assist state and local planners to allocate stockpiled ventilators to healthcare facilities during a pandemic, accounting for critical factors in facilities' ability to make use of additional ventilators. These strategies include actions both in the pre-pandemic and intra-pandemic stages. As a part of pandemic preparedness, public health officials should identify and query healthcare facilities in their jurisdiction that currently care for critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation to determine existing inventory of these devices and facilities' ability to absorb additional ventilators. Facilities must have sufficient staff, space, equipment, and supplies to utilize allocated ventilators adequately. At the time of an event, jurisdictions will need to verify and update information on facilities' capacity prior to making allocation decisions. Allocation of scarce life-saving resources during a pandemic should consider ethical principles to inform state and local plans for allocation of ventilators. In addition to ethical principles, decisions should be informed by assessment of need, determination of facilities' ability to use additional ventilators, and facilities' capacity to ensure access to ventilators for vulnerable populations (eg, rural, inner city, and uninsured and underinsured individuals) or high-risk populations that may be more susceptible to illness.","Koonin, Lisa M; Pillai, Satish; Kahn, Emily B; Moulia, Danielle; Patel, Anita",Health Secur,,359

High rates of implementation of most recommended measures were noted with the exception of requiring 2 m distance for students, fitting hand sanitizers in classrooms and introducing one-way systems in school corridors. Measures such as regular handwashing and stopping assemblies were considered easy to implement. Majorly challenging measures included distancing between individuals (for students: 51%, N = 99; for staff: 34%; N = 98; for parents: 26%, N = 100), spacing out desks (34%, N = 99), keeping same staff assigned to each student group (33%, N = 97) and staggering break times (25%, N = 99). Rapid implementation was facilitated by staff commitment and communication among stakeholders, but hampered by limitations with guidance received, physical environments, resources, parental adherence and balancing preventive measures with learning. Difficulties with distancing for younger children suggest that smaller bubbles with fewer distancing requirements within these may be a policy option.

Biodegradable customized scaffolds could meet safety and effectiveness to regenerate a new autologous disc, rather than using non-biodegradable materials. However, it is still technically challenging to mimic the biomechanical properties of the native disc with biodegradable polymers. In this study, new 3D tailored TMJ disc implants were developed: (1) Poly(glycerol sebacate)-PGS scaffold reinforced with electrospun Poly(Îµcaprolactone)-PCL fibers on the outer surface (PGS+PCL); (2) PCL and polyethylene glycol diacrylate-PEGDA (PCL+PEGDA) and (3) PCL. The TMJ implants were tested in a randomized preclinical trial, conducted in 24 black Merino sheep TMJ, perfoming bilateral interventions. Histologic, imaging, and kinematics analysis was performed. No statistical changes were observed between the PGS+PCL disc and the control group. PCL+PEGDA and PCL groups were associated with statistical changes in histology (p=0.004 for articular cartilage mid-layer; p=0.019 for structure changes and p=0.017 for cell shape changes), imaging (p=0.027 for global appreciation) and dangerous material fragmentation was observed. No biomaterial particles were observed in the multi-organ analysis in the different groups. The sheep confirmed to be a relevant animal model for TMJ disc surgery and regenerative approaches. PCL and PCL+PEGDA discs presented a higher risk to increase degenerative changes, due to material fragmentation.

Our purpose was to determine if the administration of both allergen and protective vaccines during one visit is safe and if such a procedure does not deteriorate the tolerance of both vaccines. As current guidelines are based on theoretical assumptions, our aim was to establish the safety and tolerance of shortening the recommended interval between vaccinations. During two influenza seasons, 44 adult patients, with a history of systemic allergic reactions after a Hymenoptera sting, underwent 58 simultaneous allergen and seasonal influenza vaccinations (study group) while in the maintenance phase of venom immunotherapy (VIT). The control group consisted of 57 healthy adults who were vaccinated against influenza only. The conditions of the patients were monitored during hospital visits, and via telecommunication methods to evaluate the safety and tolerance of the procedure. Within the study group, there were no immediate or delayed allergic reactions after vaccinations. The presence of common, adverse influenza vaccine reactions among study group patients (29%) and control group patients (32%) did not differ significantly (p = 0.841). We did not observe a difference in the frequency of various adverse reactions in either group or a dependence of previous vaccinations against influenza on the occurrence of adverse reactions. The most frequent occurrences were local adverse reactions. All adverse reactions were resolved without treatment.

The objectives of this study were to identify the clinical features and chest computed tomography (CT) findings of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients and to compare the characteristics of patients diagnosed inWuhan and in other areas of China by integrating the findings reported in previous studies. Methods. We conducted a proportion meta-analysis to integrate the results of previous studies identified in online databases, and subsequently compared the overlapping of 95% confidence intervals (CIs) between locations of diagnosis. The heterogeneity of the results of the included studies was also demonstrated. Results. Nine studies with level IV evidence were considered to be eligible for the meta-analysis, and a comparative analysis was only possible between patients diagnosed in Wuhan and outside of Wuhan in China. Fever (84.8%; 95% CI, 78.5% to 90.1%) was identified as the most common clinical manifestation in all COVID-19 patients, and signs of respiratory infection were also frequently present in these patients.When comparing the clinical features according to the location of diagnosis, fever and dyspnea were less frequent in patients diagnosed outside ofWuhan (fever: 78.1%; 95% CI, 73.2% to 82.7%; dyspnea: 3.80%; 95% CI, 0.13% to 12.22%) than in patients diagnosed inWuhan (fever: 91.7%; 95% CI, 88.0% to 94.8%; dyspnea: 21.1%; 95% CI, 13.2% to 30.3%). The chest CT findings exhibited no significant differences between the groups. Conclusion. Fever was found to be the most common symptom in COVID-19, and respiratory infection signs were also commonly present. Fever and dyspnea were less frequently observed in the patients diagnosed outside of Wuhan, which should be considered in COVID-19 screening programs. These results may be attributable to the earlier diagnosis of the disease and the younger age of patients outside ofWuhan although further analysis is needed.The role of chest CT in COVID-19 diagnosis is inconclusive based on this study.","Park, Joo-Hyun; Jang, Wook; Kim, Sang-Woo; Lee, Jeongjun; Lim, Yun-Sung; Cho, Chang-Gun; Park, Seok-Won; Kim, Bo Hae",Clin.

Development of hyperkalemia after the administration of RAAS inhibitors is of particular concern because patients at highest risk for this complication are often the same patients who derive the greatest cardiovascular or renoprotective benefit. Based on an overview of the incidence of hyperkalemia during treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers alone and in combination, this review suggests approaches for monitoring, detecting, and managing hyperkalemia in patients treated with RAAS inhibitors. Although the incidence of hyperkalemia with RAAS inhibitors is generally low, hyperkalemia can be associated with increased mortality. When using RAAS inhibitors, it is important to monitor on-treatment electrolyte levels and renal function parameters in patients with a high risk for hyperkalemia.","CHUNG, Sungjin; PARK, Cheol-Whee",Korean Journal of Medicine,,359

There is a wide consensus that this pandemic has negative psychosocial consequences as well as unforeseeable provision of mental health care services and just not on physical health alone. The aim of this research study is to determine the prevalence of psychological distress and to identify the sociodemographic variables with the main attributable factors associated with the psychological distress among healthcare workers and suggestions on how to reduce the impact on the mental health of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in different regions of the world.MethodWe performed a cross-sectional study from September-November 2020. We used a self-administered survey tool which was distributed electronically to healthcare workers across the globe. The data were stored on an online database with password protected devices where survey responses were restricted to investigators exclusively.Data collected were: 1) Socio-demographic data (age, gender, marital status, ethnicity, religion, role in the healthcare, region of practice);2) Psychological General Well-Being Index (PGWBI) questionnaire which contains 22 standardized items. This is a subjective assessment to score the degree of psychological well-being by focusing on 6 domains: depression;anxiety;positive-well-being;self-control;vitality and general health;3) Subjective assessment from respondents of the main attributable factors causing psychological distress and suggested methods to help reduce the impact on mental health on health care workers.ResultMajority out of the 217 respondents were from a younger age group;females and married/domestic partnership, mainly from Western Pacific Region, South East Asian and the African Region. More than half the respondents were moderate-severely psychologically distressed and the three main attributable factors causing psychological distress were: fear of family/friends contracting COVID-19 followed by lack of PPE and discomfort caused by wearing PPE for long hours. Respondents suggested that the distress would be reduced if: more resources were provided in hospital;protocols and guidelines were implemented and counselling facilities with recreational activities were available to frontline workers.ConclusionThis study showed that the COVID-19 pandemic has affected the mental health of healthcare workers and more support or strategies need to come in place to protect frontline workers at the time of crises.","Islam, Mahfuja George Philip Sankaran Sindhu Janet Leu Su Hui Tzun Kit",BJPsych Open,,359
219987,COVID-19 and neurodegeneration: what can we learn from the past?,2020,"This paper offers the Eastern Mediterranean Region (EMR) viewpoint with Qatar as a case for lasting transformation of health systems. The Qatar case study illustrates the importance of research in the development of health policy. It provides description of a series of projects that have been undertaken in relevant national areas such as autism, dementia, genomics, palliative care and patient safety. The paper discourse draws attention to investment requirement in health research systems to respond to country national health priorities and to strengthen public health policies for improving health and social outcomes by narrowing the gap between research and politics. In short, the discussion highlights the following: i) health is a human right marching towards universal health care, with research underpinning every advance in health care and quality medical services; ii) evidence-based research is emerging as a critical tool to aid policy- and decision-makers; iii) investment necessity in healthcare research/systems to enable responding to a country's national health priorities and to strengthen public health policies; and iv) need for multi-sectoral involvement of stakeholders to bridge the gap between research and politics. Finally, atypical stakeholders' engagement and bond to politics is a prerequisite to achieve healthcare objectives and policy success so as to reap the benefits of public health results.","Qoronfleh, M Walid",Life Sci Soc Policy,,359

COVID-19 is associated with higher surgical morbidity and mortality. An array of guidelines on the management of cancer during this pandemic have been published since the first reports of the outbreak. This narrative review brings all the relevant information from the guidelines together into one document, to support patient care. We present a detailed review of published guidelines, statements, comments from peer-reviewed journals, and nationally/internationally recognized professional bodies and societies' web pages (in English or with English translation available) between December 1, 2019 and May 27, 2020. Search terms included combinations of COVID, SARS-COV-2, guideline, gynecology, oncology, gynecological, cancer. Recommendations for surgical and oncological prioritization of gynecological cancers are discussed and summarized. The role of minimally invasive surgery, patient perspectives, medico-legal aspects, and clinical trials during the pandemic are also discussed. The consensus is that elective benign surgery should cease and cancer surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy should continue based on prioritization. Patient and staff face-to-face interactions should be limited, and health resources used efficiently using prioritization strategies. This review and the guidelines on which it is based support the difficult decisions currently facing us in gynecological cancer. It is a balancing act: limited resources and a hostile environment pitted against the time-sensitive nature of cancer treatment. We can only hope to do our best for our patients with the resources available to us.","Uwins, Christina; Bhandoria, Geetu Prakash; Shylasree, T S; Butler-Manuel, Simon; Ellis, Patricia; Chatterjee, Jayanta; Tailor, Anil; Stewart, Alexandra; Michael, Agnieszka",Int J Gynecol Cancer,,359

Chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) is a persistent, debilitating, and unexplained fatigue disorder. We investigated psychological morbidities such as CFS and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among survivors of COVID-19 over 6 months. All COVID-19 survivors from the university-affiliated hospital of Tehran, Iran, were assessed 6 months after infection onset by a previously validated questionnaire based on the Fukuda guidelines for CFS/EM and DSM-5 Checklist for PTSD (The Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for DSM-5 or PCL-5) to determine the presence of stress disorder and chronic fatigue problems. A total of 120 patients were enrolled. The prevalence rate of fatigue symptoms was 17.5%. Twelve (10%) screened positive for chronic idiopathic fatigue (CIF), 6 (5%) for CFS-like with insufficient fatigue syndrome (CFSWIFS), and 3 (2.5%) for CFS. The mean total scores in PCL-5 were 9.27 ± 10.76 (range:0-44), and the prevalence rate of PTSD was 5.8%. There was no significant association after adjusting between CFS and PTSD, gender, comorbidities, and chloroquine phosphate administration. The obtained data revealed the prevalence of CFS among patients with COVID-19, which is almost similar to CFS prevalence in the general population. Moreover, PTSD in patients with COVID-19 is not associated with the increased risk of CFS. Our study suggested that medical institutions should pay attention to the psychological consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak.","Simani, Leila; Ramezani, Mahtab; Darazam, Ilad Alavi; Sagharichi, Mastooreh; Aalipour, Mohammad Amin; Ghorbani, Fatemeh; Pakdaman, Hossein",J Neurovirol,,359

A Chinese patent medicine Toujiequwen granules has been promoted in the treatment of COVID-19. The present study was designed to reveal the molecular mechanism of Toujiequwen granules against COVID-19. A network pharmacological method was applied to screen the main active ingredients of Toujiequwen granules. Network analysis of 149 active ingredients and 330 drug targets showed the most active ingredient interacting with many drug targets is quercetin. Drug targets most affected by the active ingredients were PTGS2, PTGS1, and DPP4. Drug target disease enrichment analysis showed drug targets were significantly enriched in cardiovascular diseases and digestive tract diseases. An ""active ingredient-target-disease"" network showed that 57 active ingredients from Toujiequwen granules interacted with 15 key targets of COVID-19. There were 53 ingredients that could act on DPP4, suggesting that DPP4 may become a potential new key target for the treatment of COVID-19. GO analysis results showed that key targets were mainly enriched in the cellular response to lipopolysaccharide, cytokine activity and other functions. KEGG analysis showed they were mainly concentrated in viral protein interaction with cytokine and cytokine receptors and endocrine resistance pathway. The evidence suggests that Toujiequwen granules might play an effective role by improving the symptoms of underlying diseases in patients with COVID-19 and multi-target interventions against multiple signaling pathways related to the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Yang, Bao-Yu; Wang, Hao-Zhen; Ma, Zhen-Zhong; Lu, Chen; Li, Yang; Lu, Zi-Yin; Lu, Xiu-Li; Gao, Bing",Curr Med Sci,,359

At the clinical level, the issues are the fulfillment of medical care demand with adequate health care teams, infrastructure, and supplies, and to cover critical care demands that surpass the available resources. Therefore, ethically correct approaches are required for the allocation of life sustaining resources. There are recommendations for the allocating life support during disasters based on multiple considerations, including ethical ones. However, the ethical criteria of existing guidelines are variable. Ethical principles usually considered are saving the greatest number of lives, saving the greatest number of years of life and the principle of the life cycle or the goal to give each individual equal opportunity to live through the various phases of life. However, the centrality of the human being and the search for the common good should be considered. Knowledge of public perspectives and moral benchmarks on these issues is essential.

Few data are available on the duration and prognostic factors of the disease. We aimed to study the recovery time among a Tunisian cohort of COVID-19 confirmed patients and identify the prognostic factors. METHODS: A retrospective, nationwide study was conducted from March 2 to May 8, 2020, recruiting all patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19, by RT-PCR methods, in Tunisia. Data were collected via phone call interview. Kaplan-Meir Methods and Cox proportional hazards regression models were, respectively, used to study the recovery time and estimate its prognostic factors. RESULTS: One thousand and thirty patients with COVID-19 (aged 43.2 ± 18.2 years, 526 female (51.1%)) were enrolled. Among them 141 (14.8%) were healthcare professionals. Out of 173 patients (17.8%) admitted to the hospital, 47 were admitted in an intensive care unit. Among 827 patients who didn't require specialized care, 55.5% were self-isolated at home, while the rest were in specialized centers. Six hundred and two patients were symptomatic. A total of 634 (61.6%) patients have recovered and 45 (4.4%) patients died. The median duration of illness was estimated to be 31 days (95% CI: [29-32]). Older age (HR = 0.66, CI:[0.46-0.96], P = 0.031) and symptoms (HR = 0.61, CI:[0.43-0.81], P = 0.021) were independently associated with a delay in recovery time. Being a healthcare professional (HR = 1.52, CI: [1.10-2.08], P = 0.011) and patients in home isolation compared to isolation centers (HR = 2.99, CI: [1.85-4.83], P < 10¯3) were independently associated with faster recovery time. CONCLUSION: The duration of illness was estimated to be 1 month. However, this long estimated duration of illness may not equate to infectiousness. A particular attention must to be paid to elderly and symptomatic patients with closer monitoring.","Harizi, Chahida; Cherif, Ines; Najar, Nourhene; Osman, Molka; Mallekh, Rym; Ayed, Oumaima Ben; Ayedi, Yosr; Dhaouadi, Sonia; Hchaichi, Aicha; Safer, Mouna; Letaief, Hejer; Bouaziz, Ilhem; Derouiche, Sondes; Gharbi, Donia; Bouabid, Leila; Bougatef, Souha; Ben Salah, Hamida; Fakhfakh, Radhouane; Abid, Salma; Ben Boubaker, Ilhem Boutiba; Chahed, Mohamed Kouni; Ben-Alaya, Nissaf Bouafif",BMC Infect Dis,,359

It is therefore not surprising that the social distancing and movement restrictions associated with the Covid-19 pandemic had severe consequences for the well-being of large sections of the population, leading to increased loneliness and related mental diseases. Many people found emotional shelter in online multiplayer games, which have already proven to be great social incubators. While the positive effect games had on individuals has become evident, we are still unaware of how and if games fostered the fundamental need for connectedness that people sought. In other words: how have the social bonds and interaction patterns of players changed with the advent of the pandemic? For this purpose, we analyzed one year of data from an online multiplayer game (League of Legends) to observe the impact of Covid-19 on player assiduity and sociality in three different geographical regions (i.e., Europe, North America, and South Korea). Our results show a strong relationship between the development of Covid-19 restrictions and player activity, together with more robust and recurrent social bonds, especially for players committed to the game. Additionally, players with reinforced social bonds-i.e., people played with similar teammates-were more likely to stay in the game even once the restrictions were lifted.","Petrosino, Simone; Loria, Enrica; Pirker, Johanna",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12277v2.pdf,359

These issues are even more felt and evident in fragile patients, as those affected by neuromuscular disease. An important help came from new digital technologies that allow clinicians to remotely monitor health status and any deterioration of chronically ill patients. METHODS: In this mini-review, an initiative of the ""Digital Technologies, Web and Social Media Study Group"" of the Italian Society of Neurology, we propose to analyze the approach to neuromuscular patients by looking over raising evidence on the main cornerstones of Telemedicine (TM): clinician-patient interaction, remote clinical assessment, remote monitoring, and digital therapeutics. In particular, we explored the strategies developed by researchers and their impact on the physical and emotional status of the patients, with particular focusing on their adherence to the program of virtual monitoring. RESULTS: TM plays an important role in each of four stages of approach to neuromuscular disease, having demonstrated validity in keep close clinical patient interaction, clinical assessment, remote monitoring, and telerehabilitation. Nevertheless, there is no remote alternative to electrophysiological testing neither validate tools to assess disability. CONCLUSION: The role of TM in neuromuscular care is yet underestimated but is crucial, beyond the pandemic era. Further development of TM is advisable, through making specific apps, remotely controlled by clinicians, and making more engaging clinicians-patients interaction. Last, it is necessary to ensure adequate internet access to everyone.","Spina, Emanuele; Trojsi, Francesca; Tozza, Stefano; Iovino, Aniello; Iodice, Rosa; Passaniti, Carla; Abbadessa, Gianmarco; Bonavita, Simona; Leocani, Letizia; Tedeschi, Gioacchino; Manganelli, Fiore; Lavorgna, Luigi",Neurol. sci,,359

Despite the huge advances and progress made in recent decades, clinical reasoning to achieve an accurate diagnosis still seems to be the most appropriate and distinctive feature of clinical medicine. This is particularly evident in internal medicine where diagnostic boundaries are often blurred. Making a diagnosis is a multi-stage process which requires proper data collection, the formulation of an illness script and testing of the diagnostic hypothesis. To make sense of a number of variables, physicians may follow an analytical or an intuitive approach to clinical reasoning, depending on their personal experience and level of professionalism. Intuitive thinking is more typical of experienced physicians, but is not devoid of shortcomings. Particularly, the high risk of biases must be counteracted by de-biasing techniques, which require constant critical thinking.

The frequency of lymphocyte subsets, including T-CD4+ , T-CD8+ , NK, B cells, and monocytes, was measured in all patients and 31 controls by flow cytometry. Our findings demonstrated that the percentage of lymphocytes, CD4+ , and CD8+ T cells were decreased in COVID-19 patients compared with the control group. Regarding the clinical severity, the number of lymphocytes, CD4+ , CD8+ T cells, and NK cells were also decreased in severe cases when compared with mild cases. Finally, our data have also indicated the increase in apoptosis of mononuclear cells from COVID-19 patients which was more remarkable in severe clinical cases. The frequency of immune cells is a useful indicator for prediction of severity and prognosis of COVID-19 patients. These results could help to explain the immunopathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and introducing novel biomarkers, therapeutic strategies, and vaccine candidates.","Taghiloo, Saeid; Aliyali, Masoud; Abedi, Siavash; Mehravaran, Hossein; Sharifpour, Ali; Zaboli, Ehsan; Eslami-Jouybari, Mohammad; Ghasemian, Roya; Vahedi-Larijani, Laleh; Hossein-Nattaj, Hadi; Amjadi, Omolbanin; Rezazadeh, Hadiseh; Ajami, Abolghasem; Asgarian-Omran, Hossein",J. med. virol,,359

Various stochastic frameworks have been developed to model mortality patterns taking into account the main stylized facts driving these patterns. However, relying on the prediction of one specific model can be too restrictive and lead to some well documented drawbacks including model misspecification, parameter uncertainty and overfitting. To address these issues we first consider mortality modelling in a Bayesian Negative-Binomial framework to account for overdispersion and the uncertainty about the parameter estimates in a natural and coherent way. Model averaging techniques, which consists in combining the predictions of several models, are then considered as a response to model misspecifications. In this paper, we propose two methods based on leave-future-out validation which are compared to the standard Bayesian model averaging (BMA) based on marginal likelihood. Using out-of-sample errors is a well-known workaround for overfitting issues. We show that it also produces better forecasts. An intensive numerical study is carried out over a large range of simulation setups to compare the performances of the proposed methodologies. An illustration is then proposed on real-life mortality datasets which includes a sensitivity analysis to a Covid-type scenario. Overall, we found that both methods based on out-of-sample criterion outperform the standard BMA approach in terms of prediction performance and robustness.","Barigou, Karim; Goffard, Pierre-Olivier; Loisel, St'ephane; Salhi, Yahia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15434v1.pdf,359

We aim to investigate the clinical characteristic and allergy status of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: Electronic medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, and radiological materials of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, were extracted and analyzed. RESULTS: An approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7%) and female COVID-19 patients was found, with an overall median age of 57.0 years. All patients were community-acquired cases. Fever (91.7%), cough (75.0%), fatigue (75.0%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (39.6%) were the most common clinical manifestations, whereas hypertension (30.0%) and diabetes mellitus (12.1%) were the most common comorbidities. Drug hypersensitivity (11.4%) and urticaria (1.4%) were self-reported by several patients. Asthma or other allergic diseases were not reported by any of the patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 1.4%) patients and current smokers (1.4%) were rare. Bilateral ground-glass or patchy opacity (89.6%) was the most common sign of radiological finding. Lymphopenia (75.4%) and eosinopenia (52.9%) were observed in most patients. Blood eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe (r = .486, P < .001) and nonsevere (r = .469, P < .001) patients after hospital admission. Significantly higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were associated with severe patients compared to nonsevere patients (all P < .001). CONCLUSION: Detailed clinical investigation of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 cases suggests eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a potential indicator for diagnosis. Allergic diseases, asthma, and COPD are not risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Older age, high number of comorbidities, and more prominent laboratory abnormalities were associated with severe patients.","Zhang, Jin-Jin; Dong, Xiang; Cao, Yi-Yuan; Yuan, Ya-Dong; Yang, Yi-Bin; Yan, You-Qin; Akdis, Cezmi A; Gao, Ya-Dong",Allergy,,359

Renin-angiotensin aldosterone inhibitors (RAASi) are often indicated for these patients but may increase the risk for recurrent AKI. Here, we examined whether RAASi associates with a higher risk for recurrent AKI and mortality among survivors of moderate to severe AKI in a retrospective cohort of Veterans who survived Stage II or III AKI. The primary exposure was RAASi at hospital discharge and the primary endpoint was recurrent AKI within 12 months. Cox proportional hazards models were fit on a propensity score-weighted cohort to compare time to recurrent AKI and mortality by RAASi exposure. Among 96,983 patients, 40% were on RAASi at discharge. Compared to patients who continued RAASi use, those discontinuing use experienced no difference in risk for recurrent AKI but had a significantly higher risk of mortality [hazard ratio 1.33 (95% confidence interval1.26-1.41)]. No differences in recurrent AKI risk was observed for non-users started or not on RAASi compared to prevalent users who continued RAASi. Subgroup analyses among those with diabetes, chronic kidney disease, heart failure, and malignancy were similar with exception of a modest reduction in recurrent AKI risk among RAASi discontinuers with chronic kidney disease. Thus, RAASi use among survivors of moderate to severe AKI was associated with little to no difference in risk for recurrent AKI but was associated with improved survival. Reinitiating or starting RAASi among patients with strong indications is warranted but should be balanced with individual overall risk for recurrent AKI and with adequate monitoring.","Siew, Edward D; Parr, Sharidan K; Abdel-Kader, Khaled; Perkins, Amy M; Greevy, Robert A; Vincz, Andrew J; Denton, Jason; Wilson, Otis D; Hung, Adriana M; Ikizler, T Alp; Robinson-Cohen, Cassianne; Matheny, Michael E",Kidney int,,359

Here we show that nanoscale phosphopeptide assemblies cluster ALP to enable caveolae-mediated endocytosis (CME) and endosomal escape. Specifically, fluorescent phosphopeptides undergo enzyme-catalyzed self-assembly to form nanofibers. Live cell imaging unveils that phosphopeptides nanoparticles, coincubated with HEK293 cells overexpressing red fluorescent protein-tagged tissue-nonspecific ALP (TNAP-RFP), cluster TNAP-RFP in lipid rafts to enable CME. Further dephosphorylation of the phosphopeptides produces peptidic nanofibers for endosomal escape. Inhibiting TNAP, cleaving the membrane anchored TNAP, or disrupting lipid rafts abolishes the endocytosis. Decreasing the transformation to nanofibers prevents the endosomal escape. As the first study establishing a dynamic continuum of nanoscale assemblies for cellular uptake, this work illustrates an effective design for enzyme-responsive supramolecular therapeutics and provides mechanism insights for understanding the dynamics of cellular uptake of proteins or exogenous peptide aggregates.","He, Hongjian; Guo, Jiaqi; Xu, Jiashu; Wang, Jiaqing; Liu, Shuang; Xu, Bing",Nano Lett,,359

Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 have been reported, but the relationships between laboratory features and viral load has not been comprehensively described. METHODS: Adult inpatients (&#8805;18 years old) with COVID-19 who underwent multiple (&#8805;5 times) nucleic acid tests with nasal and pharyngeal swabs were recruited from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, including general patients (n = 70), severe patients (n = 195), and critical patients (n = 43). Laboratory data, demographic data, and clinical data were extracted from electronic medical records. The fitted polynomial curve was used to explore the association between serial viral loads and illness severity. RESULTS: Viral load of SARS-CoV-2 peaked within the first few days (2-4 days) after admission, then decreased rapidly along with virus rebound under treatment. Critical patients had the highest viral loads, in contrast to the general patients showing the lowest viral loads. The viral loads were higher in sputum compared with nasal and pharyngeal swab (P = .026). The positive rate of respiratory tract samples was significantly higher than that of gastrointestinal tract samples (P < .001). The SARS-CoV-2 viral load was negatively correlated with portion parameters of blood routine and lymphocyte subsets and was positively associated with laboratory features of cardiovascular system. CONCLUSIONS: The serial viral loads of patients revealed whole viral shedding during hospitalization and the resurgence of virus during the treatment, which could be used for early warning of illness severity, thus improve antiviral interventions.","Huang, Jing-Tao; Ran, Ruo-Xi; Lv, Zhi-Hua; Feng, Li-Na; Ran, Chen-Yang; Tong, Yong-Qing; Li, Dong; Su, Han-Wen; Zhu, Cheng-Liang; Qiu, Shi-Li; Yang, Jie; Xiao, Meng-Yao; Liu, Ming-Jun; Yang, Yu-Ting; Liu, Song-Mei; Li, Yan",Clin Infect Dis,,359

Serological assays, in particular immunoglobulin (Ig)M and IgG anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), have today several applications but the interpretation of their results remains an open challenge. Given the emerging role of the IgA isotype in the COVID-19 diagnostics, we aimed to identify the SARS-CoV-2 IgA antibodies in a COVID-19 population seronegative for IgM. A total of 30 patients hospitalized in San Giovanni di Dio Hospital (Florence, Italy) for COVID-19, seronegative for IgM antibodies, have been studied for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. They all had a positive oro/nasopharyngeal swab reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction result. Assays used were a chemiluminescent assay measuring SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM and IgG (S + N) and an ELISA, measuring specific IgG (S1) and IgA antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Among the 30 patients, eight were positive for IgA, seven were positive for IgG (N + S), and two for IgG (S1), at the first point (5-7 days from the onset of symptoms). The IgA antibodies mean values at the second (9-13 days) and third (21-25 days) time points were even more than twice as high as IgG assays. The agreement between the two IgG assays was moderate (Cohen's K = 0.59; SE = 0.13). The inclusion of the IgA antibodies determination among serological tests of the COVID-19 diagnostic is recommended. IgA antibodies may help to close the serological gap of the COVID-19.

233333,The Impact of COVID-19 on US Radiation Oncology Residents,2021,"Type III interferon (IFN-&#955;) is currently considered to be largely nonredundant to type I interferon (IFN-&#945;) in antivirus infection, especially in epithelial cells. Previous studies reported that, compared with IFN-&#945;, IFN-&#955; exhibited stronger induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) at the transcriptional level in intestinal epithelial cells and stronger inhibition of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV). In this study, the different mechanisms of ISG upregulation induced by IFN-&#945; and IFN-&#955;1 were compared at the mRNA and protein levels in the porcine intestinal epithelial cell model (IPEC-J2). It was proved that IFN-&#955;1 consistently exhibited stronger stimulation effects at both levels. At the mRNA level, 132 genes were significantly upregulated upon IFN-&#955;1 stimulation, while 42 genes upon IFN-&#945; stimulation. At the protein level, 47 proteins were significantly upregulated upon IFN-&#955;1 stimulation, but only 8 proteins were upregulated upon IFN-&#945; stimulation. The shared upregulated genes/proteins by IFN-&#955;1 in both transcriptional and translational omics, especially the regulation factors of ISG15, were involved in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Compared to IFN-&#945;, IFN-&#955;1 could induce more consistent upregulation of the key ISGs (ISG15, USP18, OASL, and RSAD2) at 3-24 h postinduction as measured by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) validation. It was further confirmed through functional analysis that ISG15 and RSAD2 could inhibit PEDV infection in dose-dependent manners. This study provided solid evidence that IFN-&#955;1 could induce a more unique and higher ISG expression level, which exhibited anti-PEDV effects on porcine intestinal epithelial cells.","Zhao, Mingzhi; Li, Liang; Zhai, Linhui; Yue, Qi; Liu, Hongyu; Ren, Suping; Jiang, Xingwei; Gao, Fenghua; Bai, Shanshan; Li, Honghao; Zhang, Ying; Xu, Hongwei; Zhang, Liying; Liu, Pinghuang; Tan, Minjia; Yu, Qun",J Proteome Res,,359

Despite these continuous advancements for COVID-19 screening, many concerns remain about model reliability when used in a clinical setting. Much has been published, but with limited transparency in expected model performance. We set out to address this limitation through a set of experiments to quantify baseline performance metrics and variability for COVID-19 detection in chest x-ray for 12 common deep learning architectures. Specifically, we adopted an experimental paradigm controlling for train-validation-test split and model architecture where the source of prediction variability originates from model weight initialization, random data augmentation transformations, and batch shuffling. Each model architecture was trained 5 separate times on identical train-validation-test splits of a publicly available x-ray image dataset provided by Cohen et al. (2020). Results indicate that even within model architectures, model behavior varies in a meaningful way between trained models. Best performing models achieve a false negative rate of 3 out of 20 for detecting COVID-19 in a hold-out set. While these results show promise in using AI for COVID-19 screening, they further support the urgent need for diverse medical imaging datasets for model training in a way that yields consistent prediction outcomes. It is our hope that these modeling results accelerate work in building a more robust dataset and a viable screening tool for COVID-19.","Goodwin, Brian D; Jaskolski, Corey; Zhong, Can; Asmani, Herick",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.02167v1.pdf,359

The model is based upon ensemble or population dynamics that generate outcomes, like new cases and deaths over time. The purpose of this model is to quantify the uncertainty that attends predictions of relevant outcomes. By assuming suitable conditional dependencies, one can model the effects of interventions (e.g., social distancing) and differences among populations (e.g., herd immunity) to predict what might happen in different circumstances. Technically, this model leverages state-of-the-art variational (Bayesian) model inversion and comparison procedures, originally developed to characterise the responses of neuronal ensembles to perturbations. Here, this modelling is applied to epidemiological populations-to illustrate the kind of inferences that are supported and how the model per se can be optimised given timeseries data. Although the purpose of this paper is to describe a modelling protocol, the results illustrate some interesting perspectives on the current pandemic; for example, the nonlinear effects of herd immunity that speak to a self-organised mitigation process.","Friston, Karl J; Parr, Thomas; Zeidman, Peter; Razi, Adeel; Flandin, Guillaume; Daunizeau, Jean; Hulme, Ollie J; Billig, Alexander J; Litvak, Vladimir; Moran, Rosalyn J; Price, Cathy J; Lambert, Christian",Wellcome Open Res,,359

The temporal pattern of opioid prescribing in the context of the opioid epidemic remains unknown. Objective: To examine the temporal pattern of opioid prescribing within an ED for varying pain conditions between 2009 and 2018. Design, Setting, and Participants: A population-based, cross-sectional study was conducted at the ED of an urban academic medical center. All patients treated within that ED between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2018, were included. Main Outcomes and Measures: The proportion of patients prescribed an opioid for treatment of pain in the ED temporally by condition, condition type, patient demographics, and physician prescriber. Results: Between 2009 and 2018, 556â¯176 patient encounters took place in the ED, with 70â¯218 unique opioid prescriptions ordered. A total of 316 632 patients (55.9%) were female, 45 070 (42.6%) were of white race, and 43 412 (40.6%) were privately insured; the median age group was 41 to 45 years. Yearly opioid prescriptions decreased by 66.3% (from 16.3 to 5.5 opioids per 100 encounters) between 2013 and 2018, with a yearly adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 0.808 (95% CI, 0.802-0.814) compared with the prior year. In patients with musculoskeletal pain (back, joint, limb, and neck pain), opioid prescribing decreased by 71.1% (from 36.7 to 10.6 opioids per 100 encounters between 2013 and 2018; aOR, 0.758; 95% CI, 0.744-0.773). In patients with musculoskeletal trauma (fracture, sprain, contusion, and injury), opioid prescribing decreased by 58.0% (from 34.2 to 14.8 opioids per 100 encounters; aOR, 0.811; 95% CI, 0.797-0.824). In patients with nonmusculoskeletal pain (abdominal pain, kidney stone, respiratory distress, and pharyngitis) opioid prescribing decreased by 53.7% (from 20.1 to 9.3 opioids per 100 encounters; aOR, 0.850; 95% CI, 0.834-0.868). Between 2009 and 2018, patients who were black (aOR, 0.760; 95% CI, 0.741-0.779) and those who were Asian (aOR, 0.714; 95% CI, 0.665-0.764) had the lowest odds of receiving an opioid compared with other racial/ethnic groups. Conclusions and Relevance: There was a substantial temporal decrease in the number of opioid prescriptions within this ED during the study period. This decrease was associated with substantial relative reductions in opioid prescribing for treatment of musculoskeletal pain compared with fractures and kidney stones.","Smith, Ben C; Vigotsky, Andrew D; Apkarian, A Vania; Schnitzer, Thomas J",JAMA Netw Open,,359

A multidisciplinary point of view from first year residents (PGY-1),2020,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Acute stroke patients may have undiagnosed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection, transmissible to medical professionals involved in their care. Our aim was to determine the value of incorporating a chest computed tomography (CT) scan during acute stroke imaging, and the factors that influence this decision. METHODS: We constructed a probabilistic decision tree of the value of acquiring a chest CT scan or not, expressed in quality-adjusted life months (QALM) of patients and medical professionals. The model was based on the chance of detecting infection by chest CT scan, the case fatality rates of COVID-19 infection, the risk of COVID-19 infection after exposure, the expected proportion of medical professionals exposed, and the exposure reduction derived from early disease detection. RESULTS: The decision to incorporate the chest CT scan was superior to not doing so (12.00 QALM vs 11.99 QALM, respectively), when the probability of patients having undetected COVID-19 infection is 3.5%, potentially exposing 100% of medical professionals, and if early detection reduces exposure by 50%. The risk of developing symptomatic COVID-19 infection following exposure casts uncertainty on the results, but this is offset by the potential for reducing exposure. CONCLUSIONS: We identified a measurable benefit of incorporating a chest CT into the urgent imaging protocol of acute stroke patients in reducing exposure of medical professionals without appropriate precautions. The clinical impact of this benefit, however, may not be materially significant.","Qureshi, Adnan I; French, Brandi R; Siddiq, Farhan; Arora, Niraj A; Nattanmai, Premkumar; Gomez, Camilo R",j. neuroimaging,,359

Both cash transfers and food security may have important contributions to child cognitive development. This study examines the potential impact of combinations of cash transfers and food security status on child cognitive development and educational outcomes. Cross-sectional data for 796 HIV-affected children in the Child Community Care study were utilised for this analysis. Children and caregivers completed interview schedules comprised of standardised items on socio-demographics, household data, cash grant receipt and food security status, school achievement, and cognition. A series of logistic and linear regression models and marginal effects analyses were undertaken to explore the impacts of differing levels of social protection (none; either cash grant receipt or food secure status or, both in combination) on child educational and cognitive outcomes. Although all children lived in poverty-stricken households, 20% (157/796) of children did not live in a household in receipt of a cash grant and did not report food security; 32.4% (258/796) reported either component of social protection and, 47.9% (381/796) received both measures of social protection in combination. Compared to no social protection, being in receipt of either component of social protection was found to be significantly associated with being in the correct class for age, higher scores of non-verbal cognition, and higher working memory scores. Receiving both social protection measures in combination was found to be significantly associated with reduced educational risk scores, improved odds of being in the correct class for age, regular school attendance, missing less than a week of school in the previous two weeks, higher scores on measures of nonverbal cognition, higher working memory scores, and learning new things more easily. Educational and cognitive outcomes for children can be bolstered by social protection measures (cash grant receipt or food security). Benefits are enhanced when social protection is received in combination. Such findings support the notion of synergistic social protection responses for children living in environments impacted by high levels of HIV burden and deprivation.","Sherr, Lorraine; Roberts, Kathryn J; Tomlinson, Mark; Skeen, Sarah; Mebrahtu, Helen; Gordon, Sarah; du Toit, Stefani; Haag, Katharina; Cluver, Lucie D",AIDS behav,,359

This study aimed to describe the impact of the early phase of the pandemic on physician decision-making, practice patterns, and mental health. METHODS: An anonymous survey was distributed to physician members of the Spine Intervention Society (SIS) on March 24 and April 7, 2020. Respondents provided information regarding changes in clinical volume, treatment, and mental health (Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-4]) before April 10, 2020. RESULTS: Of the 1,430 individuals who opened the survey, 260 completed it (18.2%). Overall clinical and procedural volume decreased to 69.6% and 13.0% of prepandemic volume, respectively. Mean in-person clinic visits were reduced to 17.7% of total prepandemic clinic volume. Ongoing clinical visits were predominantly completed via telemedicine (video) or telephone (74.5%), rather than in-person (25.5%). Telemedicine and telephone visits represented 24.6% and 27.3% of prepandemic clinical volume, respectively. Respondents decreased in-person visits of select groups of high-risk patients by 85.8-94.6%. Significantly more providers reported increasing rather than decreasing prescriptions of the following medications: opioids (28.8% vs 6.2% of providers, P < 0.001), muscle relaxants (22.3% vs 5.4%, P < 0.001), neuropathic pain medications (29.6% vs 3.8%, P < 0.001), and acetaminophen (26.2% vs 4.2%, P < 0.001).

241979,Update on COVID-19 Myocarditis,2020,"BACKGROUND: The mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantining on children and young people (CYP) living in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has yet to be fully comprehended. CYP in LMICs are at utmost risk, given the COVID-19-related restrictions and social distancing measures, resulting in reduced access to school-based services for nutritional and mental health needs. This study examined mental health of CYP during the first COVID-19 lockdown in Zambia and Sierra Leone. METHOD: A total of 468 disabled and disadvantaged CYP aged 12 to 25 completed a planning tool that comprised the short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS), as well as open-ended questions covering social connectedness, physical distancing and educational challenges during the lockdown. The community coaches screened individuals and families who could be eligible to receive emergency aid, and based on a convenience sample following distribution of aid, recipients were invited to complete the planning tool. RESULTS: The data showed that participants in the global south have increasing anxieties and fears centred on accessing offline educational resources and income loss in the family effecting food security and their ability to return to education. Mean (SD) SWEMWBS scores for all participants in Zambia and Sierra Leone, were 19.61 (3.45) and 21.65 (2.84), respectively. Mental well-being scores were lower in females, children aged 12-14 and participants with two or more disabilities. Factors significantly associated with poor mental wellbeing in the sample were: type of disability, nationality, peer relationships, connection to others during the pandemic, knowledge about COVID-19, worry about the long-term impact of COVID-19, and the types of self-isolating. CONCLUSION: The study shows that participants who self-reported low levels of COVID-19 health literacy also scored low on the mental wellbeing self-assessment. Yet, despite undoubted limited resources, these CYP are doing well in identifying their needs and maintaining hope in the face of the problems associated with COVID-19 in countries where stigma persists around mental ill-health.","Sharpe, Darren; Rajabi, Mohsen; Chileshe, Clement; Joseph, Sitali Mayamba; Sesay, Ibrahim; Williams, James; Sait, Siraj",BMC Psychol,,359

242830,Ophthalmic manifestations of COVID-19; a less-appreciated yet significant challenge,2021,"Cloud computing is a technology that has become increasingly popular over the past decade within several enterprises. This popularity can be attributed to its benefits, including lower operating costs, improved computational capabilities, increased flexibility and on-demand storage space. As a result, many enterprises are already in various Cloud Computing (CC) adoption and implementation stages. This study investigates the decision criteria used by large enterprises in South Africa (SA) for the adoption of cloud technology. The majority of large enterprises have comprehensive resources, resulting in established Information Technology (IT) systems and infrastructure set up within their organizations. Though this is the case, the adoption of CC by large enterprises has been on the rise. This may not be a surprise as CC literature points out to benefits and influencers of CC adoption. However, the decision criteria used by large enterprises in SA in adopting CC are lacking in the literature reviewed. The study followed an inductive approach making use of qualitative methods. Findings revealed that large enterprises do not make use of a formalized or standardized decision criteria. However, operational cost, enterprise strategic intent and product efficiency formed key criteria for adopting CC. In addition, security, cloud service provider adoption frameworks and data sovereignty were the key criteria used to select a CC service provider. The research will contribute towards CC technology adoption literature, particularly for developing countries.","Bakasa, Tseriwa; Pekane, Ayanda",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.09757v1.pdf,359

The number of infections has continued to rise and had reached 30,000 worldwide at the time this paper was written. Because of the high risk of nosocomial transmission, medical health care workers may be experiencing substantial psychological stress. This descriptive study aimed to identify psychosocial effects on hospital staff associated with working in a hospital environment during the COVID-19 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: Our survey participants included 57 frontline clinicians working at Wuhan First Hospital and 157 medical students working at Jiangsu Provincial People's Hospital during the COVID-19 outbreak. The questionnaire we adopted included questions regarding the participants' personal well-being, sociodemographic characteristics, and psychological status. METHODS: 57 frontline clinicians working in Wuhan First Hospital and 157 medical training students working in Jiangsu Provincial Peoples Hospital during this outbreak participated in our survey. The questionnaire we adopted included questions regarding the participants' personal well-being, sociodemographic characteristics and the psychological status. RESULTS: The COVID-19 outbreak had psychological impacts both on formal workers and medical students. The psychological effects included sleep disorders, anxiety, and depression. There was no significant difference between the group of formal workers and medical students (P=.85), and more than 50% (30/54, 56%, vs. 83/157, 52.9%) of the respondents reported pandemic-related mental disorders. CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates that the high risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure caused substantial psychological stress among health care workers.

243076,How Canada can better embed randomized trials into clinical care,2020,"BACKGROUND: The vast majority of people worldwide have been impacted by coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In addition to the millions of individuals who have been infected with the disease, billions of individuals have been asked or required by local and national governments to change their behavioral patterns. Previous research on epidemics or traumatic events suggests that this can lead to profound behavioral and mental health changes; however, researchers are rarely able to track these changes with frequent, near-real-time sampling or compare their findings to previous years of data for the same individuals. OBJECTIVE: By combining mobile phone sensing and self-reported mental health data among college students who have been participating in a longitudinal study for the past 2 years, we sought to answer two overarching questions. First, have the behaviors and mental health of the participants changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic compared to previous time periods? Second, are these behavior and mental health changes associated with the relative news coverage of COVID-19 in the US media? METHODS: Behaviors such as the number of locations visited, distance traveled, duration of phone usage, number of phone unlocks, sleep duration, and sedentary time were measured using the StudentLife smartphone sensing app. Depression and anxiety were assessed using weekly self-reported ecological momentary assessments of the Patient Health Questionnaire-4. The participants were 217 undergraduate students, with 178 (82.0%) students providing data during the Winter 2020 term. Differences in behaviors and self-reported mental health collected during the Winter 2020 term compared to previous terms in the same cohort were modeled using mixed linear models. RESULTS: During the first academic term impacted by COVID-19 (Winter 2020), individuals were more sedentary and reported increased anxiety and depression symptoms (P<.001) relative to previous academic terms and subsequent academic breaks. Interactions between the Winter 2020 term and the week of the academic term (linear and quadratic) were significant. In a mixed linear model, phone usage, number of locations visited, and week of the term were strongly associated with increased amount of COVID-19-related news. When mental health metrics (eg, depression and anxiety) were added to the previous measures (week of term, number of locations visited, and phone usage), both anxiety (P<.001) and depression (P=.03) were significantly associated with COVID-19-related news. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with prior academic terms, individuals in the Winter 2020 term were more sedentary, anxious, and depressed. A wide variety of behaviors, including increased phone usage, decreased physical activity, and fewer locations visited, were associated with fluctuations in COVID-19 news reporting. While this large-scale shift in mental health and behavior is unsurprising, its characterization is particularly important to help guide the development of methods to reduce the impact of future catastrophic events on the mental health of the population.","Huckins, Jeremy F; daSilva, Alex W; Wang, Weichen; Hedlund, Elin; Rogers, Courtney; Nepal, Subigya K; Wu, Jialing; Obuchi, Mikio; Murphy, Eilis I; Meyer, Meghan L; Wagner, Dylan D; Holtzheimer, Paul E; Campbell, Andrew T",J Med Internet Res,,359

To better understand what social policies would best promote population health, economic recovery, and preparedness for future pandemics, one must look both upstream and abroad for inspiration. In this article, the author argues for a suite of near-term and longer-term interventions, including universal health insurance and paid sick leave; upgraded wage insurance policies; tax reform; investments in parental leave, childcare, and education; and upgraded government record systems. Policies that equalize the distribution of the social determinants of health and promote social solidarity also will improve population health and economic performance and allow everyone to confront future pandemics more successfully.","Lynch, Julia",J Health Polit Policy Law,,359

Point of care tests (POCTs), mainly using Lateral Flow Devices (LFDs), have been deployed hurriedly without much consideration of their usability or impact on care workflow. Even after the pandemic POCTs, particularly multiplex tests, may be an important control against spread of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory infections in care homes by enabling identification of cases. They should not, however, replace other infection control measures such as barrier methods and quarantine. Adherence to LFDs as implemented among care home staff is suboptimal. Other tests-such as point of care polymerase chain reaction and automated antigen tests-would also need to be accommodated into care home workflows to improve adherence. The up-front costs of POCTs are straightforward but additional costs, including staffing preparation and reporting processes and the impacts of false positive and negative tests on absence rates and infection days, are more complex and as yet unquantified. A detailed appraisal is needed as the future of testing in care homes is considered.","Buckle, Peter; Micocci, Massimo; Tulloch, John; Kierkegaard, Patrick; Parvulescu, Paula; Thompson, Carl; Spilsbury, Karen; Allen, A Joy; Body, Richard; Hayward, Gail; Buchan, Iain; Gordon, Adam L",Age ageing,,359

246854,30-Day postoperative COVID-19 outcomes in 398 patients from regional hospitals utilising a designated COVID-19 minimal surgical site pathway,2021,"This paper investigates investment and output dynamics in a simple continuous time setting, showing that financing constraints substantially alter the relationship between net worth and the decisions of an optimizing firm. In the absence of financing constraints, net worth is irrelevant (the 1958 Modigliani-Miller irrelevance proposition applies). When incorporating financing constraints, a decline in net worth leads to the firm reducing investment and also output (when this reduces risk exposure). This negative relationship between net worth and investment has already been examined in the literature. The contribution here is providing new intuitive insights: (i) showing how large and long lasting the resulting non-linearity of firm behaviour can be, even with linear production and preferences; and (ii) highlighting the economic mechanisms involved-the emergence of shadow prices creating both corporate prudential saving and induced risk aversion. The emergence of such pronounced non-linearity, even with linear production and preference functions, suggests that financing constraints can have a major impact on investment and output; and this should be allowed for in empirical modelling of economic and financial crises (for example, the great depression of the 1930s, the global financial crisis of 2007-2008 and the crash following the Covid-19 pandemic of 2020).","Isohätälä, Jukka; Milne, Alistair; Robertson, Donald",Mathematics,,359

METHODS: Data from COVID-19 cases were collected from daily notifications given to the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China and Tianjin Health Committee. All of the data were analyzed with SPSS, version 24.0 software (IBM Corp, Armonk, NY). RESULTS: As of February 24, 2020, there have been 135 confirmed cases, 3 deaths, and 87 recoveries in Tianjin, China. The incidence of COVID-19 was 8.65/1 000 000 with a 2.22% case fatality rate. Regarding geographic distribution, the incidence was 8.82 per 1 000 000 in urban areas and 8.00 per 1 000 000 in suburbs. During the early stage of the epidemic, most cases came from urban areas and in patients with a history of sojourning in Hubei Province. The majority of patients were 31-70 years old (75.97%). A familial clustering was the most important characteristic of COVID-19 (accounting for 74.81%).

Herein we present a simple, reproducible, and highly-customizable manual-entry tool to track ICU patients using new HIPAA-compliant Google Big Query technology for parsing large datasets. This innovative flow chart is useful and could be modified to serve the particular needs of different sub-specialists, particularly those that either rely heavily on hand-written notes or experience poor electronic medical record (EMR) penetration. METHODS: The tool was developed using a combination of three Google Enterprise features: Google Forms for data input, Google Sheets for data output, and Google Big Query for data parsing. Code was written in SQL. Sheets functions were used to transpose and filter parsed data. White and black box tests were performed to examine functionality. RESULTS: Our tool was successfully able to collect and output fictional patient data across all 57 data points specified by the intensivists and surgeons of Cardiovascular Department of Mt. Sinai Morningside Hospital. CONCLUSION: The functional tests performed demonstrate use of the tool. Though originally conceived to simplify patient data collection for newly relocated physicians to the ICU, our tool also overcomes financial and technological barriers previously described in low-income countries that could dramatically improve patient care and provide data to power future studies in these regions. With the original code provided, implementers may adapt our tool to best meet the requirements of their clinical setting and protocols during this very challenging time.","Newman, Noah; Gilman, Sam; Burdumy, Matt; Yimen, Mekeleya; Lattouf, Omar",Int J Med Inform,,359
248753,Fatal Retroperitoneal Hematoma Associated with Covid-19 Prophylactic Anticoagulation Protocol,2021,"By means of their pivotal role in the outbreak of a variety of diseases, such as, recently, COVID-19, the molecular aspects of cell membrane function have gained considerable attention from researchers in recent decades. The resulting information explosion and the growing interdisciplinary character of cell biology seems, however, to not be represented in science classrooms. Hence, there appears to be a gap between what is scientifically known and what is actually taught in classrooms. Framed by the model of educational reconstruction (MER), the aim of our study is therefore to identify scientific core ideas of cell membrane biology from an educational point of view. This is achieved by conducting qualitative content analysis of relevant cell biology literature. By using Conceptual Metaphor as a theory of understanding, we additionally illuminate the experiential grounding of scientific conceptions. Our results propose that cell membrane biology can be structured into three core ideas, comprising compartmentalisation, physical and chemical properties, and multicellular coordination interrelated by evolution as a key aspect. Our results show that scientists conceive these ideas metaphorically. Embodied part-whole relations seem, for example, to lay the grounds for their understanding of biological function. The outcomes of the study may inform future cell membrane teaching.","Johann, Leonie; Groß, Jorge; Messig, Denis; Rusk, Fredrik",Educ. Sci.,,359

Iran is one of the top 10 most affected countries. Search engines provide useful data from populations, and these data might be useful to analyze epidemics. Utilizing data mining methods on electronic resources' data might provide a better insight into the COVID-19 outbreak to manage the health crisis in each country and worldwide. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to predict the incidence of COVID-19 in Iran. METHODS: Data were obtained from the Google Trends website. Linear regression and long short-term memory (LSTM) models were used to estimate the number of positive COVID-19 cases. All models were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation, and root mean square error (RMSE) was used as the performance metric. RESULTS: The linear regression model predicted the incidence with an RMSE of 7.562 (SD 6.492). The most effective factors besides previous day incidence included the search frequency of handwashing, hand sanitizer, and antiseptic topics. The RMSE of the LSTM model was 27.187 (SD 20.705). CONCLUSIONS: Data mining algorithms can be employed to predict trends of outbreaks. This prediction might support policymakers and health care managers to plan and allocate health care resources accordingly.","Ayyoubzadeh, Seyed Mohammad; Ayyoubzadeh, Seyed Mehdi; Zahedi, Hoda; Ahmadi, Mahnaz; R Niakan Kalhori, Sharareh",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,359

The purpose of this editorial is to discuss the potential role of cryoablation for reducing the psychosocial burden of surgical delay during the COVID-19 pandemic by expediting the management of breast cancer while also lessening demand on limited healthcare resources. METHODS: This editorial critiques current expert opinion recommendations that aim to reduce viral transmission and preserve healthcare resources during the COVID-19 pandemic by advocating delay of elective breast cancer surgery. RESULTS: The editorial summarizes the current state of the evidence that supports the selective use of cryoablation as a definite or stopgap measure in the management of breast cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic or when healthcare resources are limited. CONCLUSIONS: As an office-based procedure performed under local anesthesia, cryoablation eliminates the need for operating room personnel and equipment while also reducing the psychosocial impact of delayed breast cancer surgery. By reducing the number of patient and healthcare provider interactions, cryoablation not only decreases the risk of viral transmission but also the need for personal protective devices during resource-limited times.","Holmes, Dennis R",Breast Cancer Res Treat,,359

Two out of fifteen dogs from households with confirmed human cases of COVID-19 in Hong Kong SAR were found to be infected using quantitative RT-PCR, serology, sequencing the viral genome, and in one dog, virus isolation. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in a 17-year-old neutered male Pomeranian from five nasal swabs collected over a 13-day period. A 2.5-year-old male German Shepherd dog had SARS CoV-2 RNA on two occasions and virus was isolated from nasal and oral swabs. Both dogs had antibody responses detected using plaque reduction neutralization assays. Viral genetic sequences of viruses from the two dogs were identical to the virus detected in the respective human cases. The animals remained asymptomatic during quarantine. The evidence suggests that these are instances of human-to-animal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

252184,Cytopathology Practice in the COVID-19 Era: Focus on Sample Workload,2021,"A cross sectional study was conducted to demonstrate the value of Computed Tomographic (CT) scan in clinically suspected 114 COVID-19 patients with emphasis on identifying and characterizing the most common findings of chest CT. The CT findings were compared and correlated with the results of Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction for corona virus disease. This study was conducted in the Department of Radiology and Imaging, Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Dhaka with clinically COVID-19 suspected patients. This cross sectional study was performed from July 7 to August 7, 2020 where both chest HRCT and RT-PCR test were included, keeping RT-PCR as the reference standard. Of the 114 patients 104(91.22%) patients had ground glass opacities (with no consolidation), 50(43.85%) patients had ground glass opacity and consolidation. Along with ground glass opacities 60(52.63%) patients had associated crazy paving appearance, 44(39.59%) patients had reverse halo sign, 76(66.66%) patients had vascular thickening and 60(52.63%) patients had fibrotic shadows. Most patients (94%) (98/104) had bilateral chest CT findings. Out of 114 patients, 96 (84%) patients had positive RT-PCR results and 18(15.7%) patients had negative RT-PCR results. Out of 96 RT-PCR positive patients, 90 patients had positive chest CT findings, where was 06 patients had negative CT findings. On the other hand, out of 18 RT-PCR negative patients, 14 patients had positive chest CT findings while 4 patients had negative chest CT findings. To conclude, chest CT imaging has high sensitivity for diagnosis of COVID-19, Data and analysis from our study suggests that chest CT ought to be considered for the COVID-19 as a primary diagnostic tool for early detection of COVID-19 patients where awaited RT-PCR results.","Datta, A; Dipi, R M; Mostafa, S N; Islam, M N; Das, P P",Mymensingh Med J,,359

253000,The Points of Action of Drugs for Treating COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 was declared a global health emergency. Since children are less than 1% of reported cases, there is limited information to develop evidence-based practice recommendations. The objective of this study was to rapidly gather expert knowledge and experience to guide the care of children with chronic kidney disease during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A four-round multi-center Delphi exercise was conducted among 13 centers in 11 European countries of the European Pediatric Dialysis Working Group (EPDWG) between March, 16th and 20th 2020. Results were analyzed using a mixed methods qualitative approach and descriptive statistics. RESULTS: Thirteen COVID-19 specific topics of particular need for guidance were identified. Main themes encompassed testing strategies and results (n = 4), changes in use of current therapeutics (n = 3), preventive measurements of transmission and management of COVID-19 (n = 3), and changes in standard clinical care (n = 3). Patterns of center-specific responses varied according to regulations and to availability of guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: As limited quantitative evidence is available in real time during the rapid spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, qualitative expert knowledge and experience represent the best evidence available. This Delphi exercise demonstrates that use of mixed methodologies embedded in an established network of experts allowed prompt analysis of pediatric nephrologists' response to COVID-19 during this fast-emerging public health crisis. Such rapid sharing of knowledge and local practices is essential to timely and optimal guidance for medical management of specific patient groups in multi-country health care systems such as those of Europe and the US.","Eibensteiner, Fabian; Ritschl, Valentin; Ariceta, Gema; Jankauskiene, Augustina; Klaus, Günter; Paglialonga, Fabio; Edefonti, Alberto; Ranchin, Bruno; Schmitt, Claus Peter; Shroff, Rukshana; Stefanidis, Constantinos J; Walle, Johan Vande; Verrina, Enrico; Vondrak, Karel; Zurowska, Aleksandra; Stamm, Tanja; Aufricht, Christoph",Pediatr Nephrol,,359
253082,"Demographic, multi-morbidity and genetic impact on myocardial involvement and its recovery from COVID-19: protocol design of COVID-HEART-a UK, multicentre, observational study",2021,"Green bonds have increasingly been utilized around the world as a source of financing for renewable energy development, designed with compliance requirements and measurable economic returns to investors, while mitigating climate change. However, the efficacy of green bond arranged in the emerging economies for financing renewable energy assets and how the underlying risks are managed have remained to be explored. The paper aims to examine the evolving green financial system sponsored by both public and private institutions in managing such risks within China’s emerging economy. A case study of green financing for a bundle of wind power assets led by a state-owned enterprise (SOE) reveals an alternative approach by structuring public–private collaboration while stipulating market-based financial incentives to institutional stakeholders under a political economy. This institutional consortium is composed of a state development bank, a commercial bank, credit rating agencies, institutional and private investors, regional power purchasers, and carbon trading entities. Financial stakeholders’ risk in such emerging sustainable investment is moderated by these participating institutions and structured “upsides” from carbon trading aligned with the framework of green finance and standards for green bond development. The results reveal the potentials of scaling up the development of renewable energy by adequately managing and sharing key risks, while allocating substantial funding into renewable energy projects under such a green financial system that is to be complementary with a scalable post COVID-19 economic recovery.","Fu, Jingyan Ng Artie W.",Energies,,359

253279,Relation between hematological derangements and disease outcomes in children with COVID-19 are likely indirect,2021,"Synthetic antigens based on consensus sequences that represent circulating viral isolates are sensitive, time saving and cost-effective tools for in vitro immune monitoring and to guide immunogen design. When based on a representative sequence database, such consensus sequences can effectively be used to test immune responses in exposed and infected individuals at the population level. To accelerate immune studies in SARS-CoV-2 infection, we here describe a SARS-CoV-2 2020 consensus sequence (CoV-2-cons) which is based on more than 1700 viral genome entries in NCBI and encompasses all described SARS-CoV-2 open reading frames (ORF), including recently described frame-shifted and length variant ORF. Based on these sequences, we created curated overlapping peptide (OLP) lists containing between 1500 to 3000 peptides of 15 and 18 amino acids in length, overlapping by 10 or 11 residues, as ideal tools for the assessment of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell immunity. In addition, CoV-2-cons sequence entropy values are presented along with variant sequences to provide increased coverage of the most variable sections of the viral genome. The identification of conserved protein fragments across the coronavirus family and the corresponding OLP facilitate the identification of T cells potentially cross-reactive with related viruses. This new CoV-2-cons sequence, together with the peptides sets, should provide the basis for SARS-CoV-2 antigen synthesis to facilitate comparability between ex-vivo immune analyses and help to accelerate research on SARS-CoV-2 immunity and vaccine development.","Olvera, Alex; Noguera-Julian, Marc; Kilpelainen, Athina; Romero-Martín, Luis; Prado, Julia G.; Brander, Christian",Vaccines,,359

Globally, the demands for new drugs have increased due to multidrug-resistant pathogens and emerging viruses. Keeping these facts in view, drug repurposing started for utilization of a drug in a different way from a preexisting drug, which reduces the time and cost of development of a new drug. Repurposing increases the potency of a drug and reduces its toxicity level, as it is required in lower amounts, supporting the utilization of the drug as a new therapeutic option. This will be further explored to highlight the application in AMR.","Dubey, Kashyap K; Sharma, Manisha",Arch Pharm (Weinheim),,359

Patients with underlying comorbidities have a high risk of contracting COVID-19. Therefore, serological assays are urgently needed to diagnose asymptomatic carriers of SARS-CoV-2, to estimate the prevalence of infection, and for disease prevention and control. This study aimed to develop an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in humans. Methods: An ELISA test was designed and established to detect antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein in serum samples from 41 quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) - positive hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Forty-two convalescent patients' sera served as positive controls, while 117 pre-pandemic serum samples were used as negative controls. Results: A comparison between different SARS-CoV-2 proteins was performed, which included the full-length spike (S) protein and the S1 and S2 subunits. The full-length S protein showed the strongest reactivity for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies in patients' serum samples. Additionally, since antibodies could be detected at very low concentrations, the assay was found to be sensitive. Conclusion: The current assay was specific, since cross-reactions with other SARS coronaviruses and respiratory viruses such as influenza were not found. Additionally, it was highly sensitive, since the test was able to identify antibodies even at very low concentrations. Therefore, this assay has promise as a screening method at the population level and may be used for in future seroepidemiological studies.","Mahallawi, Waleed H",,,359

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread over all 31 provinces of Iran, leading to the most cases and death among the Eastern Mediterranean countries. At the same time, Iran is under the United States political and economic sanctions that compromised Iran's health system. Although medicines and basic medical equipment exempted from the economic sanctions, direct and indirect effects of sanctions have restricted Iran's banking system, and consequently has led to a wide range of limitation on trade, manufacturing sector, insurance and ventures. All these circumstances have meant that Iran is restricted to provide the essential basic medical equipment for diagnosis, treatment and prevention of the COVID-19. Although sanctions are not the sole reason for this high rate of mortality and morbidity in a short time period, the chronic and long-term effects of sanctions may be more tangible than their acute impact. In conclusion, providing health services is one of the major problems of Iran's health system during this pandemic that potentially influence on morbidity and mortality of the COVID-19. Iran needs to be free from sanctions for battling against this crisis. Key messages: Iran is one of the countries that significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Iran is under political and economic sanctions that consequently influence on their health system during the COVID-19 crisis. The chronic and long-term effects of sanctions may be more tangible than their acute impact.","Abdoli, Amir",J Med Econ,,359

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A multicentre retrospective observational study included 59 consecutive patients. The main goals were to evaluate the number, characteristics and practical conditions of tracheostomies, and the COVID-19 status of the otorhinolaryngologists. Secondary goals were to analyse tracheostomy time, decannulation rate, immediate postoperative complications and laryngotracheal axis status. RESULTS: Tracheostomy indications were for ventilatory weaning and extubation failure in 86% and 14% of cases, respectively. The technique was surgical, percutaneous or hybrid in 91.5%, 3.4% and 5.1% of cases, respectively. None of the operators developed symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Postoperative complications occurred in 15% of cases, with no significant difference between surgical and percutaneous/hybrid techniques (P=0.33), although no complications occurred after percutaneous or hybrid tracheostomies. No procedures or complications resulted in death. The decannulation rate was 74.5% with a mean tracheostomy time of 20±12 days. In 55% of the patients evaluated by flexible endoscopy after decannulation, a laryngeal abnormality was found. On univariate analysis, no clinical features had a significant influence on tracheostomy time, decannulation rate or occurrence of laryngeal lesions.

257495,COVID-19 vaccination and antirheumatic therapy,2021,"As a consequence of the Spring 2020 lockdown that occurred in Spain due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many people lost their jobs or had to be furloughed. The objective of this study is to analyse the influence of the latter changes in labour market status on psychological well-being. For this purpose, an ad-hoc questionnaire featuring socio-demographic and mental health criteria was created. Granted that the pandemic can be viewed as an exogenous shock, the bias caused by the bidirectional problems between the work situation and mental well-being can be tackled. Results indicate that the lockdown exerted a greater negative effect on the self-perceived well-being of unemployed and furloughed persons than on those in employment. Moreover, among those in continuous employment, teleworkers experienced a lesser degree of self-perceived well-being post lockdown as compared to those people remaining in the same work location throughout the COVID-19 crisis. Finally, the lockdown provoked worse effects on the self-perceived well-being of women as compared to men, a result that appears to be related to gender differences in household production. In conclusion, these results could be especially relevant given that the evolution of the pandemic is having ongoing effects on employment and, therefore, on the mental health of workers.","Escudero-Castillo, Israel; Mato-Díaz, Fco Javier; Rodriguez-Alvarez, Ana",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,359

There is an urgent need for the development of rapid and massive detection tools as well as the identification and isolation of infected individuals. we sought to evaluate different RT-qPCR kits and protocols to evaluate the best approach to be used omitting an RNA extraction step. We have investigated the sensitivity and performance of different commercially available RT-qPCR kits in detecting SARS-CoV-2 using 80 extracted RNA and NSS from COVID-19 diagnosed patients. We evaluated the ability of each kit to detect viral RNA from both kit-extracted or directly from a pre-boiled NSS observing that direct RNA detection is possible when Ct values are lower than 30 with the three kits tested. Since SARS-CoV-2 testing in most locations occurs once COVID-19 symptoms are evident and, therefore, viral loads are expected to be high, our protocol will be useful in supporting SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis, especially in America where COVID-19 cases have exploded in the recent weeks as well as in low- and middle-income countries, which would not have massive access to kit-based diagnosis. The information provided in this work paves the way for the development of more efficient SARS-CoV-2 detection approaches avoiding an RNA extraction step.","Beltrán-Pavez, Carolina; Alonso-Palomares, Luis A; Valiente-Echeverría, Fernando; Gaggero, Aldo; Soto-Rifo, Ricardo; Barriga, Gonzalo P",J Virol Methods,,359

We synthesize current results and propose the new Rhizo-Engine framework consisting of two linked components: microbial turnover and the soil physicochemical matrix. The Rhizo-Engine is driven by rhizodeposition, root turnover, and plant uptake of nutrients and water, thereby accelerating SOC turnover through both stabilization and destabilization mechanisms. This Rhizo-Engine framework emphasizes the need for a more holistic approach to study root-driven SOC dynamics. This framework would provide better understanding of plant root effects on soil C sequestration and the sensitivity of SOC stocks to climate and land-use changes.","Dijkstra, Feike A; Zhu, Biao; Cheng, Weixin",,,359

Early and quick identification of the potential risk zones of COVID-19 infection is increasingly vital for the megacities implementing targeted infection prevention and control measures. In this study, the communities with confirmed cases during January 21-February 27 were collected and considered as the specific epidemic data for Beijing, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. We evaluated the spatiotemporal variations of the epidemics before utilizing the ecological niche models (ENM) to assemble the epidemic data and nine socioeconomic variables for identifying the potential risk zones of this infection in these megacities. Three megacities were differentiated by the spatial patterns and quantities of infected communities, average cases per community, the percentages of imported cases, as well as the potential risks, although their COVID-19 infection situations have been preliminarily contained to date. With higher risks that were predominated by various influencing factors in each megacity, the potential risk zones coverd about 75% to 100% of currently infected communities. Our results demonstrate that the ENM method was capable of being employed as an early forecasting tool for identifying the potential COVID-19 infection risk zones on a fine scale. We suggest that local hygienic authorities should keep their eyes on the epidemic in each megacity for sufficiently implementing and adjusting their interventions in the zones with more residents or probably crowded places. This study would provide useful clues for relevant hygienic departments making quick responses to increasingly severe epidemics in similar megacities in the world.","Ren, Hongyan; Zhao, Lu; Zhang, An; Song, Liuyi; Liao, Yilan; Lu, Weili; Cui, Cheng",Sci Total Environ,,359

It is usually investigated in simple scenarios, such as the removal of the system's units in random order, or sequentially ordered by specific topological descriptors. However, in the vast majority of empirical applications, it is required to dismantle the network following more sophisticated protocols, for instance, by combining topological properties and non-topological node metadata. We propose a novel mathematical framework to fill this gap: networks are enriched with features and their nodes are removed according to the importance in the feature space. We consider features of different nature, from ones related to the network construction to ones related to dynamical processes such as epidemic spreading. Our framework not only provides a natural generalization of percolation but, more importantly, offers an accurate way to test the robustness of networks in realistic scenarios.","Artime, Oriol; De Domenico, Manlio",Nat Commun,,359

We find that quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) fluctuations have a negative impact on the annual IDM, indicating that the mortality of infectious diseases varies counter-cyclically with the business cycle in China. Specifically, IDM usually increases with deterioration in economic conditions, and vice versa. The empirical results are consistent with the hypothesis I derived from the theoretical analysis, which highlights that economic fluctuations can negatively affect the mortality of infectious diseases. The findings can offer revelations for the government to consider the role of economic conditions in controlling the epidemic of infectious diseases. Policymakers should adopt appropriate and effective strategies to mitigate the potential negative effects of macroeconomic downturns on the mortality of infectious diseases. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, these analyses further emphasize the importance of promoting economic growth, increasing public health expenditure, and preventing and controlling foreign infectious diseases.","Sun, Ting-Ting; Tao, Ran; Su, Chi-Wei; Umar, Muhammad",Front Public Health,,359

Then, appropriate distances between normalized time series are used to further analyze the relationships between case trajectories on a month-by-month basis. Our algorithm shows that 31 states are experiencing second surges, while four of the 10 largest states are still in their first surge, with case counts that have never decreased.

We confirmed that mucosally-vaccinated hamsters had robust antibody responses. We then induced a post-vaccination infection by inoculating vaccinated index hamsters with SARS-CoV-2. Oral and IN-vaccinated hamsters had decreased viral RNA and infectious virus in the nose and lungs and experienced less lung pathology compared to mock-vaccinated hamsters post challenge. Naive hamsters exposed in a unidirectional air flow chamber to mucosally-vaccinated, SARS-CoV-2-infected hamsters had lower nasal swab viral RNA and exhibited less clinical symptoms of disease than control animals.

Vaccines represent a key answer to control these viruses. However, in the case of a public health emergency, vaccine development, safety, and partial efficacy concerns may hinder their prompt deployment. Thus, developing broad-spectrum antiviral molecules for a fast response is essential to face an outbreak crisis as well as for bioweapon countermeasures. So far, broad-spectrum antivirals include two main categories: the family of drugs targeting the host-cell machinery essential for virus infection and replication, and the family of drugs directly targeting viruses. Among the molecules directly targeting viruses, nucleoside analogues form an essential class of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs. In this review, we will discuss the interest for broad-spectrum antiviral strategies and their limitations, with an emphasis on virus-targeted, broad-spectrum, antiviral nucleoside analogues and their mechanisms of action.","Geraghty, Robert J; Aliota, Matthew T; Bonnac, Laurent F",Viruses,,359

Although asymptomatic cases are not unique to COVID-19, the high asymptomatic case rate raised many problems for developing effective public health interventions. The current modeling effort explored how asymptomatic transmission might impact pandemic responses in four key areas: isolation procedures, changes in reproduction rate, the potential for reduced transmission from asymptomatic cases, and social adherence to public health measures. A high rate of asymptomatic cases effectively requires large-scale public health suppression and mitigation procedures given that quarantine procedures alone could not prevent an outbreak for a virus such as SARS-CoV-2. This problem only becomes worse without lowering the effective reproduction rate, and even assuming the potential for reduced transmission, any virus with a high degree of asymptomatic transmission will likely produce a pandemic. Finally, there is a concern that asymptomatic individuals will also refuse to adhere to public health guidance. Analyses indicate that, given certain assumptions, even half of the population adhering to public health guidance could reduce the peak and flatten the curve by over 90%. Taken together, these analyses highlight the importance of taking asymptomatic cases into account when modeling viral spread and developing public health intervention strategies.","Biggs, Adam T; Littlejohn, Lanny F",Risk anal,,359

Our secondary objectives were to determine the types of medications that the older adults are more likely to restrict and to determine the factors that influence these decisions. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey experiment in which participants read 6 scenarios, each stating that they had a 3-day supply of a particular medication remaining. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: National Web-based survey distributed to 1457 U.S. adults aged 65 years and older by Dynata from March 25, 2020, to April 1, 2020. OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants reported whether they would go to a pharmacy, have a medication delivered, or restrict the use of each medication. They reported their perceptions and experiences with COVID-19, health risk factors, preferences for more or less care (medical maximizer-minimizer), medication attitudes (beliefs about medicines questionnaire), health literacy, prescription insurance status, and demographics. RESULTS: Most participants (84%) were told to shelter in place, but only 12% reported attempting to obtain extra medications. Participants most often reported that they would go to the pharmacy to obtain each medication (ranging from tramadol 48.9% to insulin 64.9%) except for zolpidem, which they were most likely to restrict (45.4%). Participants who reported comorbidities that increased their risk of COVID-19 were just as likely to go to the pharmacy as those without. In multinomial logistic regression analyses, women and the oldest participants were more likely to seek delivery of medications. Restricting medications was most common for 2 symptom-focused medications (tramadol and zolpidem), and both demographic factors (e.g., gender) and beliefs (e.g., medical maximizing-minimizing preferences) were associated with such decisions. CONCLUSION: Many older adults intend to continue to go to the pharmacy to obtain their medications during a pandemic, even those who have health conditions that further increase their risk for COVID-19.","Vordenberg, Sarah E; Zikmund-Fisher, Brian J",J Am Pharm Assoc (2003),,359

Older adults in particular, living in isolated rural areas or so-called 'medical deserts', are facing major difficulties in getting access to diagnosis and care. Telemedical approaches to assessments are promising and seem well accepted, reducing the burden of bringing patients to specialized clinics. However, many older adults are not yet adequately equipped to allow for proper implementation of this technology. A potential solution could be a mobile unit in the form of a van, equipped with the telemedical system which comes to the patients' home. The aim of this proof-of-concept study is to evaluate the feasibility and reliability of such mobile unit settings for remote cognitive testing. Methods and analysis: eight participants (aged between 69 and 86 years old) from the city of Digne-Les-Bains volunteered for this study. A basic neuropsychological assessment, including a short clinical interview, is administered in two conditions, by telemedicine in a mobile clinic (equipped van) at a participants' home and face to face in a specialized clinic. The administration procedure order is randomized, and the results are compared with each other. Acceptability and user experience are assessed among participants and clinicians in a qualitative and quantitative manner. Measurements of stress indicators were collected for comparison. RESULTS: The analysis revealed no significant differences in test results between the two administration procedures. Participants were, overall, very satisfied with the mobile clinic experience and found the use of the telemedical system relatively easy.

Treatment access and self-management for these conditions can be supported through eHealth approaches. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of the mobile app Tät II for self-management of UUI and MUI in women. Methods: This randomized controlled trial included women ≥18 years old with UUI or MUI and ≥2 leakages per week. Those with red-flag symptoms were excluded. Participants were recruited via analog and digital advertisements and screened for initial selection through a web-based questionnaire. Data were collected using another questionnaire and a 2-day bladder diary. A telephone interview confirmed the symptom diagnosis. Participants were randomized (1:1) to receive access to a treatment app (including pelvic floor muscle training, bladder training, psychoeducation, lifestyle advice, tailored advice, exercise log, reinforcement messages, and reminders) or an information app (control group), with no external treatment guidance provided. The primary outcome was incontinence symptoms at the 15-week follow-up, measured using the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ)−Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF). Urgency symptoms were assessed using the ICIQ−Overactive Bladder Module (ICIQ-OAB) and quality of life using the ICIQ−Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Quality of Life Module (ICIQ-LUTSqol). Incontinence episode frequency (IEF) was calculated per bladder diary entries. Improvement was measured using the Patient’s Global Impression of Improvement. All outcomes were self-reported. Cure was defined as no leakages per the bladder diary. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed. Results: Between April 2017 and March 2018, 123 women (mean age 58.3, SD 9.6 years) were randomized to the treatment (n=60, 2 lost to follow-up) or information (n=63) group. Of these, 35 (28%) women had UUI, and 88 (72%) had MUI. Mean ICIQ-UI SF score at follow-up was lower in the treatment group than in the information group (estimated difference −3.1, 95% CI −4.8 to −1.3). The estimated between-group difference was −1.8 (95% CI −2.8 to −0.99) for mean ICIQ-OAB score and −6.3 (95% CI −10.5 to −2.1) for the mean ICIQ-LUTSqol score at follow-up. IEF reduction from baseline to follow-up was greater in the treatment group (−10.5, IQR −17.5 to −3.5) than in the information group (P&lt;.001). Improvement was reported by 87% (52/60) of treatment group participants and by 30% (19/63) of information group participants. The cure rate was 32% in the treatment group, and 6% in the information group (odds ratio 5.4, 95% CI 1.9-15.6;P=.002). About 67% (40/60) of the treatment group participants used the app more than thrice a week. Conclusions: The treatment app was effective for improving urgency and mixed incontinence in women. When self-management is appropriate, this app may be a good alternative to pharmacological treatment or other conservative management, thus increasing access to care.

264104,Registry of neurological manifestations due to coronavirus-19 (COVID-19),2021,"Detecting COVID-19 early may help in devising an appropriate treatment plan and disease containment decisions. In this study, we demonstrate how transfer learning from deep learning models can be used to perform COVID-19 detection using images from three most commonly used medical imaging modes X-Ray, Ultrasound, and CT scan. The aim is to provide over-stressed medical professionals a second pair of eyes through intelligent deep learning image classification models. We identify a suitable Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model through initial comparative study of several popular CNN models. We then optimize the selected VGG19 model for the image modalities to show how the models can be used for the highly scarce and challenging COVID-19 datasets. We highlight the challenges (including dataset size and quality) in utilizing current publicly available COVID-19 datasets for developing useful deep learning models and how it adversely impacts the trainability of complex models. We also propose an image pre-processing stage to create a trustworthy image dataset for developing and testing the deep learning models. The new approach is aimed to reduce unwanted noise from the images so that deep learning models can focus on detecting diseases with specific features from them. Our results indicate that Ultrasound images provide superior detection accuracy compared to X-Ray and CT scans. The experimental results highlight that with limited data, most of the deeper networks struggle to train well and provides less consistency over the three imaging modes we are using. The selected VGG19 model, which is then extensively tuned with appropriate parameters, performs in considerable levels of COVID-19 detection against pneumonia or normal for all three lung image modes with the precision of up to 86% for X-Ray, 100% for Ultrasound and 84% for CT scans.","Horry, Michael J.; Chakraborty, Subrata; Paul, Manoranjan; Ulhaq, Anwaar; Pradhan, Biswajeet; Saha, Manas; Shukla, Nagesh",IEEE Access,,359

However, no specific antiviral drugs or vaccines can be used. Phillyrin (KD-1), a representative ingredient of Forsythia suspensa, possesses anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, and antiviral activities. However, little is known about the antiviral abilities and mechanism of KD-1 against SARS-CoV-2 and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). PURPOSE: The study was designed to investigate the antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities of KD-1 against the novel SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E and its potential effect in regulating host immune response in vitro. METHODS: The antiviral activities of KD-1 against SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E were assessed in Vero E6 cells using cytopathic effect and plaque-reduction assay. Proinflammatory cytokine expression levels upon infection with SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E infection in Huh-7 cells were measured by real-time quantitative PCR assays. Western blot assay was used to determine the protein expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-&#954;B) p65, p-NF-&#954;B p65, I&#954;B&#945;, and p-I&#954;B&#945; in Huh-7 cells, which are the key targets of the NF-&#954;B pathway. RESULTS: KD-1 could significantly inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E replication in vitro. KD-1 could also markedly reduce the production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-&#945;, IL-6, IL-1ß, MCP-1, and IP-10) at the mRNA levels. Moreover, KD-1 could significantly reduce the protein expression of p-NF-&#954;B p65, NF-&#954;B p65, and p-I&#954;B&#945;, while increasing the expression of I&#954;B&#945; in Huh-7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: KD-1 could significantly inhibit virus proliferation in vitro, the up-regulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines induced by SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E by regulating the activity of the NF-ÐºB signaling pathway. Our findings indicated that KD-1 protected against virus attack and can thus be used as a novel strategy for controlling the coronavirus disease 2019.","Ma, Qinhai; Li, Runfeng; Pan, Weiqi; Huang, Wenbo; Liu, Bin; Xie, Yuqi; Wang, Zhoulang; Li, Chufang; Jiang, Haiming; Huang, Jicheng; Shi, Yongxia; Dai, Jun; Zheng, Kui; Li, Xiaobo; Hui, Min; Fu, Li; Yang, Zifeng",Phytomedicine,,359

266131,Manipulated bio antimicrobial peptides from probiotic bacteria as proposed drugs for COVID-19 disease,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic. Many studies have shown that several laboratory parameters are related to disease severity and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 cases. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the relationship of a prognostic factor, D-dimer, with disease severity, need for intensive care unit (ICU) care, and mortality in SARS-CoV-2 patients. METHODS: A systematic search for all observational studies and trials involving adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 that had any data related to D-dimer on admission was conducted using PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, ProQuest, and MedRxiv databases. We performed random-effects inverse-variance weighting analysis using mean difference (MD) of D-dimer values for outcomes such as disease severity, mortality, and need for ICU care. RESULTS: A total of 29 studies (4,328 patients) were included in this meta-analysis, which revealed a higher mean of D-dimer levels on admission in severe patients than in nonsevere patients (MD = 0.95, [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.61-1.28], P < .05; I2 = 90%). The nonsurvivor group had a higher pooled MD of D-dimer values on admission (MD = 5.54 [95% CI: 3.40-7.67], P < .05; I2 = 90%). Patients who needed ICU admission had insignificantly higher D-dimer values than patients who did not need ICU admission (MD = 0.29, [95% CI: -0.05 to 0.63], P = .10; I2 = 71%). CONCLUSION: Elevated D-dimer levels on admission were associated with an increased risk of disease severity and mortality in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Nugroho, Johanes; Wardhana, Ardyan; Maghfirah, Irma; Mulia, Eka Prasetya Budi; Rachmi, Dita Aulia; A039,; yun, Maya Qurota; Septianda, Imanita",Int. j. lab. hematol,,359

These advances have been driven in part by the pediatric neurology physician-scientist workforce and its efforts. However, pediatric neurology research faces significant challenges from internal and external forces including work-life balance demands, COVID-19 pandemic effects, and research funding. Understanding the impact of these challenges on the perceptions, planning, and careers of pediatric neurology physician-scientists is needed to guide the research mission. METHODS: Our objective was to survey the research challenges, goals, and priorities of pediatric neurologists. In 2020 we conducted a cross-sectional, 28-question survey emailed to 1,775 members of the Child Neurology Society. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-one individuals responded to the survey. Most respondents were grant investigators (52%) and conducted clinical research (69%). Research areas included epilepsy (23%), neurodevelopmental and autism (16%), neurocritical care and stroke (11%), neurogenetics and neurometabolics (9%), neonatal neurology (8%), and others. The most common funding source was the National Institutes of Health (37%). Shared major research concerns were funding, utilization of remote technology, overcoming disparities, natural history and multicenter studies, global neurology, and diversification of the research portfolio. Commitment to continuing and increasing research efforts was evident. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey demonstrates obstacles for physician-scientist researchers in pediatric neurology, but it also shows optimism about continued opportunity. Creative approaches to address challenges will benefit the research mission, maximize the current and future pool of researchers, and help improve the lives of children with neurological disorders.","Bonkowsky, Joshua L; Felling, Ryan J; Grinspan, Zachary M; Guerriero, Réjean M; Kosofsky, Barry E; Lyons-Warren, Ariel M; deVeber, Gabrielle A",Pediatr Neurol,,359

Moreover, epidemics caused by viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the newly emerging SARS-CoV-2 occur during the winter months. The mechanisms underlying the seasonal nature of respiratory viral infections have been examined and debated for many years. The two major contributing factors are the changes in environmental parameters and human behavior. Studies have revealed the effect of temperature and humidity on respiratory virus stability and transmission rates. More recent research highlights the importance of the environmental factors, especially temperature and humidity, in modulating host intrinsic, innate, and adaptive immune responses to viral infections in the respiratory tract. Here we review evidence of how outdoor and indoor climates are linked to the seasonality of viral respiratory infections. We further discuss determinants of host response in the seasonality of respiratory viruses by highlighting recent studies in the field.

This is because the mortality of infectious diseases determines the basic policy stance of measures to prevent infectious diseases. Early screening of high-risk groups and taking action are the basics of disease management. This study examined the correlation of comorbidities on the mortality of patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We constructed epidemiologic characteristics and medical history database based on the Korean National Health Insurance Service Big Data and linked COVID-19 registry data of Korea Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (KCDC) for this emergent observational cohort study. A total of 9,148 patients with confirmed COVID-19 were included. Mortalities by sex, age, district, income level and all range of comorbidities classified by International Classification of Diseases-10 based 298 categories were estimated. RESULTS: There were 3,556 male confirmed cases, 67 deaths, and crude death rate (CDR) of 1.88%. There were 5,592 females, 63 deaths, and CDR of 1.13%. The most confirmed cases were 1,352 patients between the ages of 20 to 24, followed by 25 to 29. As a result of multivariate logistic regression analysis that adjusted epidemiologic factors to view the risk of death, the odds ratio of death would be hemorrhagic conditions and other diseases of blood and blood-forming organs 3.88-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.52-9.88), heart failure 3.17-fold (95% CI, 1.88-5.34), renal failure 3.07-fold (95% CI, 1.43-6.61), prostate malignant neoplasm 2.88-fold (95% CI, 1.01-8.22), acute myocardial infarction 2.38-fold (95% CI, 1.03-5.49), diabetes was 1.82-fold (95% CI, 1.25-2.67), and other ischemic heart disease 1.71-fold (95% CI, 1.09-2.66). CONCLUSION: We hope that this study could provide information on high risk groups for preemptive interventions. In the future, if a vaccine for COVID-19 is developed, it is expected that this study will be the basic data for recommending immunization by selecting those with chronic disease that had high risk of death, as recommended target diseases for vaccination.","Kim, Dong Wook; Byeon, Kyeong Hyang; Kim, Jaiyong; Cho, Kyu Dong; Lee, Nakyoung",J Korean Med Sci,,359

CIGB-258 is a therapeutic option for the latter group of patients. This drug is an altered peptide ligand (APL) derived from the cellular stress protein 60 (HSP60). In preclinical models, this peptide developed anti-inflammatory effects and increased regulatory T cell (Treg) activity. Results from a phase I clinical trial with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients indicated that CIGB-258 was safe and reduced inflammation. The aim of this study was to examine specific biomarkers associated with hyperinflammation, some cytokines linked to the cytokine storm granzyme B and perforin in a cohort of COVID-19 patients treated with this peptide. All critically ill patients were under invasive mechanical ventilation and received the intravenous administration of 1 or 2 mg of CIGB-258 every 12 h. Seriously ill patients were treated with oxygen therapy receiving 1 mg of CIGB-258 every 12 h and all patients recovered from their severe condition. Biomarker levels associated with hyperinflammation, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-&#945;), granzyme B, and perforin, significantly decreased during treatment. Furthermore, we studied the ability of CIGB-258 to induce Tregs in COVID-19 patients and found that Tregs were induced in all patients studied.

Ideally, the style transfer manipulation should also preserve the semantic content of the source image. A commonly used approach to assist in transferring styles is based on Gram matrix optimization. One problem of Gram matrix-based optimization is that it does not consider the correlation between colors and their styles. Specifically, certain textures or structures should be associated with specific colors. This is particularly challenging when the target style image exhibits multiple style types. In this work, we propose a color-aware multi-style transfer method that generates aesthetically pleasing results while preserving the style-color correlation between style and generated images. We achieve this desired outcome by introducing a simple but efficient modification to classic Gram matrix-based style transfer optimization. A nice feature of our method is that it enables the users to manually select the color associations between the target style and content image for more transfer flexibility. We validated our method with several qualitative comparisons, including a user study conducted with 30 participants. In comparison with prior work, our method is simple, easy to implement, and achieves visually appealing results when targeting images that have multiple styles.

PURPOSE: To examine the vaccine-related beliefs and behaviors associated with likely hesitancy toward vaccination against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among nonelderly adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in June 2020. Responses were sought from Tennessee adults 18 to 64 years of age who were not healthcare providers. The survey instrument focused on vaccine-related beliefs, prior and planned influenza and pneumococcal vaccine use, and attitudes toward receiving a COVID-19 vaccination. Inferential statistics assessed survey responses, and logistic regression determined predictors of the likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: A total of 1,000 completed responses were analyzed (a 62.9% response rate), and respondents were mostly White (80.1%), insured (79.6%), and/or actively working (64.2%); the sample was well balanced by gender, age, income, and political leaning. Approximately one-third (34.4%) of respondents indicated some historical vaccine hesitancy, and only 21.4% indicated always getting a seasonal influenza vaccination. More than half (54.1%) indicated at least some hesitancy toward vaccination against COVID-19, with 32.1% citing lack of evidence of vaccine effectiveness as the leading reason. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was more likely among those with more moderate (odds ratio [OR], 2.51; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.749-3.607) or conservative (OR, 3.01; 95% CI, 2.048-4.421) political leanings, Black Americans (OR, 1.80; 95% CI, 1.182-2.742), and residents of nonmetropolitan areas (OR, 1.99; 95% CI, 1.386-2.865). CONCLUSION: Subgroups of the population may prove more challenging to vaccinate against COVID-19, requiring targeted approaches to addressing hesitancy to ensure more-vulnerable populations are adequately covered.","Gatwood, Justin; McKnight, Madison; Fiscus, Michelle; Hohmeier, Kenneth C; Chisholm-Burns, Marie",Am. j. health system pharm,,359

Their robust antiviral activity is due to the strong reliance of many different viruses, including RNA viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), dengue (DENV), and Zika (ZIKV), on the IMP&#945;/ß1-virus interface. High-throughput compound screens have identified many agents that specifically target this interface. Of these, agents targeting IMP&#945;/ß1 directly include the FDA-approved macrocyclic lactone ivermectin, which has documented broad-spectrum activity against a whole range of viruses, including HIV-1, DENV1-4, ZIKV, West Nile virus (WNV), Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, chikungunya, and most recently, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Ivermectin has thus far been tested in Phase III human clinical trials for DENV, while there are currently close to 80 trials in progress worldwide for SARS-CoV-2; preliminary results for randomised clinical trials (RCTs) as well as observational/retrospective studies are consistent with ivermectin affording clinical benefit.

271758,Standard Dose Ivermectin for COVID-19,2021,"The ambient conditions surrounding liquid droplets determine their growth or shrinkage. However, the precise fate of a liquid droplet expelled from a respiratory puff as dictated by its surroundings and the puff itself has not yet been fully quantified. From the view of airborne disease transmission, such as SARS-CoV-2, knowledge of such dependencies is critical. Here, we employ direct numerical simulations (DNS) of a turbulent respiratory vapor puff and account for the mass and temperature exchange with respiratory droplets and aerosols. In particular, we investigate how droplets respond to different ambient temperatures and relative humidity (RH) by tracking their Lagrangian statistics. We reveal and quantify that in cold and humid environments, as there the respiratory puff is supersaturated, expelled droplets can first experience significant growth, and only later followed by shrinkage, in contrast to the monotonic shrinkage of droplets as expected from the classical view by Wells in 1934. Indeed, cold and humid environments diminish the ability of air to hold water vapor, thus causing the respiratory vapor puff to supersaturate. Consequently, the supersaturated vapor field drives the growth of droplets that are caught and transported within the humid puff. To analytically predict the likelihood for droplet growth, we propose a model for the axial RH based on the assumption of a quasistationary jet. Our model correctly predicts supersaturated RH conditions and is in good quantitative agreement with our DNS. Our results culminate in a temperature-RH map that can be employed as an indicator for droplet growth or shrinkage.","Ng, C. S.; Chong, K. L.; Yang, R.; Li, M.

271855,A Case of Vertical Transmission of COVID-19,2021,"Background: Throughout history, the world has witnessed natural disasters affecting businesses and societies with varying degrees of disruption. COVID-19 (henceforth C19) constituted a significant system shock and a stark reminder of the fragility and sensitive nature of supply chains. The pandemic has exerted considerable societal and economic pressure and has had an adverse impact on food supply chains in particular. Many food processing operations were forced to alter activities or close temporarily due to outbreaks. Societal lockdowns, travel restrictions, business closures and quarantine have led to structural changes in the productivity of economies and impacted the mental health and financial wellbeing of citizens. Methods: We present a critical review of the literature to explore the impact of C19 on the food supply chain. We collected data from journal articles retrieved from a leading scientific database (i.e., Scopus), books, chapters, conference proceedings, reports, and a variety of Internet websites. For the literature search, we used the following words;""COVID-19"" and ""food"". Results and conclusions: The findings of the review suggest that the C19 pandemic poses unprecedented challenges for food supply chains. We reveal that C19 has raised food insecurity and food safety concerns, increased supply chain and logistics costs and radically changed consumer behavior. On the positive side, the pandemic has improved awareness of food waste and the importance of self-grown foods. We generated nine research propositions to foster future academic research. Our study also highlighted the need to advance this literature and calls for increased attention from the supply chain management and logistics community to further analyse and quantify the impact of C19 on the food chain.Alternate abstract: Streszczenie: Wstęp: W ujęciu historycznym, świat już nieraz doświadczał naturalnych katastrof, które miały wpływ w różnym nasileniu na biznes oraz społeczeństwo.

Pandemia wywarła istotny wpływ w szczególności na tą część ogólnego łańcucha dostaw. Wiele przedsiębiorstw produkujących żywność musiało zmienił sposób swojej działalności lub czasowo ją przerwać. Lockdown, ograniczenia w podróżowaniu, zamknięcie części działalności gospodarczej i kwarantanna doprowadziły do strukturalnych zmian w produktywności ekonomii i wpłynęły na zarówno psychiczne zdrowie jak i poziom zamożności obywateli. Metody: W pracy zaprezentowany jest krytyczny przegląd literatury dotyczącej wpływu C19 na łańcuch dostaw żywności. Dane zostały zebrane na podstawie przeglądu artykułów prasowych z wiodących baz naukowych (np. Scopus), książek, rozdziałów, materiałów konferencyjnych, raportów oraz różnych stron internetowych. Przy wyszukiwaniu tych prac, słowami kluczowymi były słowa: „COVIS-19” oraz „żywność”. Wyniki i wnioski: Uzyskane wyniki badań sugerują, że pandemia C19 jest niespotykanym wyzwaniem dla łańcuchów dostaw żywności. C19 spowodował obniżenie bezpieczeństwa łańcucha dostaw żywności, zwiększył koszty logistyki i radykalnie zmienił upodobania konsumentów. Jak pozytywny efekt, pandemia zwiększyła świadomość marnotrawstwa żywności i istotność niezależności produkcji żywności. Zostały opracowane propozycje dalszych kierunków badań naukowych w tym obszarze.

We show that the stalk domain of S contains three hinges, giving the head unexpected orientational freedom. We propose that the hinges allow S to scan the host cell surface, shielded from antibodies by an extensive glycan coat. The structure of native S contributes to our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection and potentially to the development of safe vaccines.","Turonová, Beata; Sikora, Mateusz; Schürmann, Christoph; Hagen, Wim J H; Welsch, Sonja; Blanc, Florian E C; von Bülow, Sören; Gecht, Michael; Bagola, Katrin; Hörner, Cindy; van Zandbergen, Ger; Landry, Jonathan; de Azevedo, Nayara Trevisan Doimo; Mosalaganti, Shyamal; Schwarz, Andre; Covino, Roberto; Mühlebach, Michael D; Hummer, Gerhard; Krijnse Locker, Jacomine; Beck, Martin",Science,,359

However, the association of individuals' beliefs in conspiracy theories about COVID-19 with mental health and well-being issues has not been investigated. This association creates an assessable channel to identify and provide assistance to people with mental health and well-being issues during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to provide the first evidence that belief in conspiracy theories regarding the COVID-19 pandemic is a predictor of the mental health and well-being of health care workers. METHODS: We conducted a survey of 252 health care workers in Ecuador from April 10 to May 2, 2020. We analyzed the data regarding distress and anxiety caseness with logistic regression and the data regarding life and job satisfaction with linear regression. RESULTS: Among the 252 sampled health care workers in Ecuador, 61 (24.2%) believed that the virus was developed intentionally in a lab; 82 (32.5%) experienced psychological distress, and 71 (28.2%) had anxiety disorder. Compared to health care workers who were not sure where the virus originated, those who believed the virus was developed intentionally in a lab were more likely to report psychological distress and anxiety disorder and to have lower levels of job satisfaction and life satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: This paper identifies belief in COVID-19 conspiracy theories as an important predictor of distress, anxiety, and job and life satisfaction among health care workers. This finding will enable mental health services to better target and provide help to mentally vulnerable health care workers during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Xi; Zhang, Stephen X; Jahanshahi, Asghar Afshar; Alvarez-Risco, Aldo; Dai, Huiyang; Li, Jizhen; Ibarra, Verónica García",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,359

BCG vaccine appears to be one of the candidate immunostimulants in this regard. At the same time, other microbe-derived preparations capable of inducing a state of trained immunity deserve attention. BCG and other bacterial immunostimulatory agents containing a large number of biologically active subunits have long been considered as objects of search for promising pharmacological substances. The review analyzes the linkages between BCG, mycobacterial adjuvants, bacterial lysates, trained immunity, muramylpeptides (MPs) and NOD2 receptors in light of the choice of a low molecular weight alternative to multicomponent bacterial immunostimulants for ARI prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic. The search for key molecules by which bacteria stimulate innate and adaptive immune responses proceeds in a spiral. On different loops of this spiral, MPs have repeatedly reproduced the nonspecific effects of multicomponent bacterial adjuvants, vaccines and immunostimulants. MPs and peptidoglycans containing MPs determine the adjuvant properties of the cell walls of mycobacteria and their peptide-glycolipid fraction (wax D). MPs were able to replace Mycobacterium tuberculosis in complete Freunds adjuvant. MPs determine the NOD2-dependent ability of BCG to induce trained immunity. Probably, MPs provide NOD2-mediated long-term prophylactic action of bacterial lysates. All of the above has prompted revisiting the previously obtained evidence of the efficacy of glucosaminylmuramyl dipeptide (GMDP) as a NOD2 agonist in treatment/prevention of respiratory infections. We speculate here that MPs, in particular GMDP, at rational dosing regimens will be able to reproduce many aspects of the nonspecific effects of BCG and multicomponent bacterial immunostimulants in preventing ARI during the COVID-19 pandemic and in the post-pandemic period.","Kalyuzhin, O V; Andronova, T M; Karaulov, A V",Ter Arkh,,359

A comparison of the analyses with other coronavirus genomes has been performed, wherever possible. Our analysis confirms unique features in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes absent in other evolutionarily related coronavirus family genomes, which presumably confer unique infection, transmission and virulence capabilities to the virus. For understanding the crucial factors involved in host-virus interactions, we have performed Bioinformatics aided analysis integrated with experimental data related to other corona viruses. We have identified 42 conserved miRNAs that can potentially target SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Interestingly, out of these, 3 are previously reported to exhibit antiviral activity against other respiratory viruses. Gene expression analysis of known host antiviral factors reveals significant over-expression of IFITM3 and down regulation of cathepsins during SARS-CoV-2 infection, suggesting its active role in pathogenesis and delayed immune response. We also predicted antiviral peptides which can be used in designing peptide based drugs against SARS-CoV-2.

A cross-sectional study was conducted, involving 128 outbreaks (29 dairy, 58 dairy-mixed, and 41 beef) in Belgium (2016-2018). A semiquantitative PCR for 7 respiratory pathogens was done on a pooled nonendoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage sample for each herd. Potential risk factors were collected by questionnaire and derived from the national cattle registration databank. Most outbreaks occurred between October and March, and single and multiple viral infections were detected in 58.6% (75/128) and 13.3% (17/128), respectively. Bovine coronavirus (BCV) was the most frequently isolated virus (38.4%), followed by bovine respiratory syncytial virus (bRSV; 29.4%) and parainfluenzavirus type 3 (PI-3; 8.1%). Mycoplasma bovis, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Histophilus somni were detected in 33.3, 41.2, 89.1, and 36.4% of the herds, respectively. Specific risk factors for BCV detection were detection of M. haemolytica [odds ratio (OR) = 2.8 (95% confidence interval = 1.1-7.5)], increasing herd size [OR = 1.3 (1.0-1.8) for each increase with 100 animals] and detection of BCV by antigen ELISA on feces in calves in the last year [OR = 3.6 (1.2-11.1)]. A seasonal effect was shown for bRSV only {more in winter compared with autumn [OR = 10.3 (2.8-37.5)]}. Other factors associated with bRSV were PI-3 detection [OR = 13.4 (2.1-86.0)], prevalence of calves with respiratory disease [OR = 1.02 (1.00-1.04) per 1% increase], and number of days with respiratory signs before sampling [OR = 0.99 (0.98-0.99) per day increase]. Next to its association with BCV, M. haemolytica was more frequently detected in herds with 5 to 10 animals per pen [OR = 8.0 (1.4-46.9)] compared with <5 animals, and in herds with sawdust as bedding [OR = 18.3 (1.8-191.6)]. Also, for H. somni, housing on sawdust was a risk factor [OR = 5.2 (1.2-23.0)]. Purchase of cattle [OR = 2.9 (1.0-8.0)] and housing of recently purchased animals in the same airspace [OR = 5.0 (1.5-16.5)] were risk factors for M. bovis. This study identified pathogen-specific risk factors that might be useful for the development of customized control and prevention and for the design of decision support tools to justify antimicrobial use by predicting the most likely pathogen before sampling results are available.","Pardon, B; Callens, J; Maris, J; Allais, L; Van Praet, W; Deprez, P; Ribbens, S",J Dairy Sci,,359

At once it is a crisis of the pandemic, at another an information framing crisis. This article argues that public health messaging about the pandemic is complicated by a competing mix of framings by a number of actors including the state, the Church, civil society and the public, all fighting for legitimacy. The article explores some of these divergences in the interpretation of the disease and how they have given rise to multiple narratives about the pandemic, particularly online. It concludes that while different perspectives and or interpretations of a crisis is not necessarily wrong, where these detract from the crisis itself and become a contestation of individual and or sector interests, they birth a new crisis. This is the new crisis facing the continent in relation to the pandemic.","Ogola, George",Media Commun.,,359

Additionally, to analyze how external threats can contribute to spread the disease in Indigenous Lands (IL). Methods: The Brazilian Amazon is home to nearly half a million Indigenous persons, representing more than 170 ethnic groups. As a pioneer in heading Indigenous community-based surveillance (I-CBS) in Brazil, the Coordination of the Indigenous Organizations of the Brazilian Amazon (COIAB) started to monitor Indigenous COVID-19 cases in March of 2020. Brazil's Ministry of Health (MOH) was the main source of data regarding non-Indigenous cases and deaths;to contrast the government's tally, we used the information collected by I-CBS covering 25 Special Indigenous Sanitary Districts (DSEI) in the Brazilian Amazon. The incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 were calculated using the total number of new cases and deaths accumulated between the 9th and 40th epidemiological weeks. We studied (a) the availability of health care facilities to attend to Indigenous Peoples;(b) illegal mines, land grabbing, and deforestation to perform a geospatial analysis to assess how external threats affect Indigenous incidence and mortality rates.

The aims of this study were to investigate antibody levels in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, to examine the relationship between antibody levels and virus load, and to evaluate the performance of 2 different commercial kits. A total of 103 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were included in the study. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in serum samples taken from patients were investigated simultaneously with anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA ELISAs (Euroimmun) and COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) IgG/IgM (Deep Blue) kits. No positivity was detected with any of the test kits in 18 (17.4%) of the 103 samples. In symptomatic patients, 100% of IgM and IgA tests were found to be positive in the group sampled after 10 days, while 100% of IgG tests were found positive after 20 days. The sensitivity of the Deep Blue COVID-19 IgG antibody kit was calculated as 81.48% and the specificity was 97.96%. While there was no statistically significant difference between the PCR CT and ELISA OD values, a positive correlation was found between the ELISA OD values and the days since the date of symptom initiation. The sensitivity and specificity of the rapid antibody test used in this study were found to be quite high. In conditions where ELISA tests cannot be applied, it is thought that it can give an idea in terms of the presence of antibodies as a simple and fast test. Although ELISA tests are valuable in the diagnosis of COVID-19 during the acute period, they are tests that can be used safely in the diagnosis of previous infections and seroepidemiological studies.","Cosgun, Yasemin; Altas, Ayse Basak; Kuzucu, Esra Akkan; Guner, Rahmet; Erdinc, Sebnem; Eser, Fatma; Kilic, Esra Kaya; Korukluoglu, Gulay",Folia microbiol,,359

However, recent research suggests that this accessibility of (often negative) information can induce adverse psychological effects, including anxiety, panic-based hoarding, and other unhealthy behaviors. Some of these consequences have been explained with the idea of an information overload. Considering these current developments, it may become harder to effectively communicate COVID-19-related information in smaller, local contexts, such as universities. By analyzing the page views and searches on the website of a university of education in Germany, we derive recommendations for the delivery of information of local organizations. One conclusion is that the need for information during the pandemic decreases as time passes (at least at the local level of institutions such as universities), and even new emergencies such as the beginning of the second wave of COVID-19 only affect this behavioral pattern to a minor extent. As a result of this COVID-19 information fatigue, strategies to keep members of institutions informed are discussed. In addition, we suggest developing a mobile app for delivering individualized information right on hand using machine learning and natural language processing strategies. In sum, individual organizations interested in keeping their members informed concerning COVID-19 should consider the use of personalized information strategies that avoid inducing negative emotional states.

Their communications have served to educate the public on risks and initiate the widespread adoption of public health measures to 'flatten the curve'. We conducted a content analysis of COVID-19 Tweets by Canadian public health accounts during the first 6 months of the pandemic to explore differences in Tweeting practices by geography and identify opportunities to improve risk communication. We found that Canadian public health accounts in particular geographic settings did not always apply best practices for health communication. Tweeting practices differed considerably between jurisdictions with varying burdens of COVID-19. Going forward, Tweets authored by public health accounts that promote behaviour change and community-building ought to be utilized whenever risks to health are high to reflect an increase in disease transmission requiring intervention. Our study highlights the need for public health communicators to deliver messaging that is relevant for the levels of risk that their audiences are encountering in a given geographic context.","Slavik, Catherine E; Darlington, J Connor; Buttle, Charlotte; Sturrock, Shelby L; Yiannakoulias, Niko",Health Place,,359

This paper aims to conceptualize, develop, and validate a measurement scale for SCV. SCV is first defined and operationalized as a construct, followed by content validation and item measure development. Data have been collected through three independent samplings comprising a total of 558 respondents. Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses are used in a step-wise manner for scale development. Reliability and validity are evaluated. A nomological model is theorized and tested to evaluate nomological validity. For the first time, our study frames SCV as a novel and distinct construct. The findings show that SCV is a hierarchical and multidimensional construct, reflected in organizational structures, organizational resources, dynamic design capabilities, and operational aspects. The findings reveal that a central characteristic of SCV is the dynamic reconfiguration of SC structures in an adaptive manner to ensure survival in the long-term perspective. This research conceptualizes and provides specific, validated dimensions and item measures for SCV. Practitioner directed guidance and suggestions are offered for improving SCV during the COVID-19 pandemic and future severe disruptions.","Ruel, Salomée; El Baz, Jamal; Ivanov, Dmitry; Das, Ajay",Ann Oper Res,,359

Twitter is the most popular form of social media used for ID communication. We will review the power of Twitter in ID. Recent Findings: Twitter allows for real-time sharing of educational resources at ID scientific conferences, enabling individuals that are not able to attend conferences to follow conferences anytime anywhere and stimulate discussion around topics of interest with experts from across the globe. Further, Twitter chats are a valuable tool for stewardship, with different accounts periodically hosting chats on various stewardship topics. Several studies have also demonstrated the strong relationship between dissemination and citation impact of publications with the help of Twitter. There is great value in engaging with non-ID people on Twitter via dissemination of ID knowledge to other disciplines. Lastly, when used appropriately, Twitter is a useful site for distributing vaccine information, whether informally (by advocates and physicians) or formally (by government entities) and allows one to keep up with ongoing ID outbreaks in real time. Summary: Twitter has transformed how we communicate in healthcare. Particularly in ID, where bacteria and viruses can enter/exit borders anytime anywhere, global real-time information about outbreaks and antimicrobial resistance for clinicians and the public is critical. Twitter has no hierarchy or barriers, is a conduit for global collaboration, and is a way for HCPs and the public to “social”ize on healthcare topics, if used appropriately.","Kullar, Ravina; Goff, Debra A.; Gauthier, Timothy P.; Smith, Tara C.",Curr.

METHODS: Data were provided by adults with RA participating in FORWARD, The National Databank for Rheumatic Diseases, observational registry who answered COVID-19 web-based surveys in May 2020 and previously provided baseline (pre-COVID) characteristics and medication use. We compared medication changes by DMARD exposure in logistic models adjusting for age, sex, comorbidities including pulmonary and cardiovascular diseases, education, health insurance, RA activity, fatigue, and polysymptomatic distress. RESULTS: Of 734 respondents, 221 (30%) reported medication changes. Changers more commonly used glucocorticoids (GCs) (33% vs 18%) and less commonly used non-hydroxychloroquine conventional DMARDs (49% vs 62%) pre-COVID and reported more economic hardship during COVID (23% vs 15%). While JAK inhibitor use was associated (OR 1.9 [95%CI 1.0, 3.4]) with change, only pre-COVID GCs remained a strong predictor (OR 3.0 [1.9, 4.9]) in multivariable models. Change in care was significantly associated with pulmonary disease (OR 2.9 [1.3, 6.5]), worse RA activity (OR 1.1 [1.0, 1.1]), and GC use (OR 1.6 [1.0, 2.5]). While the incidence of medication change before and after ACR guidelines were published was the same, self-imposed changes were approximately twice as likely before, and physician guided changes were more likely after. CONCLUSION: Persons with RA in the US made substantial medication changes during the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes after publication of ACR recommendations were made with increased physician guidance.","Michaud, Kaleb; Pedro, Sofia; Wipfler, Kristin; Agarwal, Ekta; Katz, Patricia",Arthritis care &amp; research (2010 : Online),,359

The epidemiological data, from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, are statistics of newly confirmed cases, newly suspected cases, new deaths, and currently suspected cases at a given time. The study identified three strategies in the coinage of neologisms: categorization, avoidance, and synthesis. In addition, a strong correlation between emergent neologisms and pandemic developments was discovered with a binomial model, and the emerging neologisms demonstrated a skewed S-curve life cycle, which is different from the established S-curve model of replacement changes. In sum, by leveraging internet usage data, this first study of the life cycle of emergent neologisms has several contributions: A theory of how new words emerge, the correlation between emergent neologisms and emerging events, and the potential of modeling language use for epidemiological predictions.","Lei, Siyu Yang Ruiying Huang Chu-Ren",Lingua,,359

278400,Deficiencies in Planning Interventional Trial Registration of COVID-19 in China,2021,"Given the social and economic upheavals caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, political leaders, health officials, and members of the public are eager for solutions. One of the most promising, if they can be successfully developed, is vaccines. While the technological development of such countermeasures is currently underway, a key social gap remains. Past experience in routine and crisis contexts demonstrates that uptake of vaccines is more complicated than simply making the technology available. Vaccine uptake, and especially the widespread acceptance of vaccines, is a social endeavor that requires consideration of human factors. To provide a starting place for this critical component of a future COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the United States, the 23-person Working Group on Readying Populations for COVID-19 Vaccines was formed. One outcome of this group is a synthesis of the major challenges and opportunities associated with a future COVID-19 vaccination campaign and empirically-informed recommendations to advance public understanding of, access to, and acceptance of vaccines that protect against SARS-CoV-2. While not inclusive of all possible steps than could or should be done to facilitate COVID-19 vaccination, the working group believes that the recommendations provided are essential for a successful vaccination program.","Schoch-Spana, Monica; Brunson, Emily K; Long, Rex; Ruth, Alexandra; Ravi, Sanjana J; Trotochaud, Marc; Borio, Luciana; Brewer, Janesse; Buccina, Joseph; Connell, Nancy; Hall, Laura Lee; Kass, Nancy; Kirkland, Anna; Koonin, Lisa; Larson, Heidi; Lu, Brooke Fisher; Omer, Saad B; Orenstein, Walter A; Poland, Gregory A; Privor-Dumm, Lois; Quinn, Sandra Crouse; Salmon, Daniel; White, Alexandre",Vaccine,,359

Affordable novel drugs with less severe side effects are urgently required. We investigated the effect of withanone (WN) from Withania somnifera on the serotonin system of wild-type and knockout Caenorhabditis elegans strains using in silico, in vitro, and in vivo methods. METHODS: WN or fluoxetine (as positive control drug) was administered to wild-type (N2) and knockout C. elegans strains (AQ866, DA1814, DA2100, DA2109, and MT9772) to determine their effect on oxidative stress (Trolox, H2DCFDA, and juglone assays) on osmotic stress and heat stress and lifespan. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was applied to investigate the effect of WN or fluoxetine on the expression of serotonin receptors (ser-1, ser-4, ser-7) and serotonin transporter (mod-5). The binding affinity of WN to serotonin receptors and transporter was analyzed in silico using AutoDock 4.2.6. RESULTS: WN scavenged ROS in wild-type and knockout C. elegans and prolonged their lifespan. WN upregulated the expression of serotonin receptor and transporter genes. In silico analyses revealed high binding affinities of WN to Ser-1, Ser-4, Ser-7, and Mod-5. LIMITATIONS: Further studies are needed to prove whether the results from C. elegans are transferrable to mammals and human beings. CONCLUSION: WN ameliorated depressive-associated stress symptoms by activating the serotonin system. WN may serve as potential candidate in developing new drugs to treat depression.","Naß, Janine; Efferth, Thomas",Pharmacopsychiatry,,359

279532,Ards Related to Covid-19,2020,"To analyze the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 in pregnancy and the drugs that can be used to treat pregnancy with COVID-19, so as to provide evidence for drug selection in clinic. By reviewing the existing literature, this paper analyzes the susceptibility of pregnant women to virus, especially to SARS-CoV-2, from the aspects of anatomical, reproductive endocrine and immune changes during pregnancy and screens effective and fetal-safe treatments from the existing drugs. The anatomical structure of the respiratory system is changed during pregnancy, and the virus transmitted by droplets and aerosols is more easily inhaled by pregnant women and is difficult to remove. Furthermore, the prognosis is worse after infection when compared with non-pregnancy women. And changes in reproductive hormones and immune systems during pregnancy collectively make them more susceptible to certain infections. More importantly, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-2, the SARS-CoV-2 receptor, has been proven highly increased during pregnancy, which may contribute to the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2. When it comes to treatment, specific drugs for COVID-19 have not been found at present, and taking old drugs for new use in treating COVID-19 has become an emergency method for the pandemic. Particularly, drugs that show superior maternal and fetal safety are worthy of consideration for pregnant women with COVID-19, such as chloroquine, metformin, statins, lobinavir/ritonavir, glycyrrhizic acid, and nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery (NMDD), etc. Pregnant women are susceptible to COVID-19, and special attention should be paid to the selection of drugs that are both effective for maternal diseases and friendly to the fetus. However, there are still many deficiencies in the study of drug safety during pregnancy, and broad-spectrum, effective and fetal-safe drugs for pregnant women need to be developed so as to cope with more infectious diseases in the future.","Zhao, Xiaoxuan; Jiang, Yuepeng; Zhao, Yang; Xi, Hongyan; Liu, Chang; Qu, Fan; Feng, Xiaoling",Eur J Clin Microbiol Infect Dis,,359

A Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQCs) in the hybrid quantum-classical framework is introduced as a universal function approximator to perform optimization with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). We employ a statistical and differential geometric approach to study the learning theory of QNN. The evolution of parametrized unitary operators is correlated with the trajectory of parameters in the Diffusion metric. We establish the parametrized version of Quantum Complexity and Quantum Chaos in terms of physically relevant quantities, which are not only essential in determining the stability, but also essential in providing a very significant lower bound to the generalization capability of QNN. We explicitly prove that when the system executes limit cycles or oscillations in the phase space, the generalization capability of QNN is maximized. Moreover, a lower bound on the optimization rate is determined using the well known Maldacena Shenker Stanford (MSS) bound on the Quantum Lyapunov exponent.","Choudhury, Sayantan; Dutta, Ankan; Ray, Debisree",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.07145v1.pdf,359

This report highlights potential risks faced by their agri-food sectors due to the COVID-19 pandemic and outlines the responses and policy actions each member is taking to address threats to food security and prevent hunger. Research Method: Publicly available information was synthesized, and insights from 19 individuals working in agriculture or agri-food-related areas in the public or private sectors or academia in APO member countries were obtained. Findings: Imminent, medium-and long-term food security challenges due to COVID-19 vary among APO member countries. However, through the implementation of key policies, many stress the need for critical agricultural inputs, such as fertilizers and safe, quality seeds, to meet seasonal crop calendars. The longer COVID-19 containment measures stay in place, the more challenging the recovery process will be for ensuring smooth food production, accessibility to staple food and nutrition and trade among countries.

280364,COVID-19 and/with dengue infection: A curse in an overburdened healthcare system,2020,"In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, people over 65 or suffering from certain conditions were deemed at high risk and asked to isolate themselves. This led to the simulated patient (SP) program at the University of Bern being depleted of middle-aged and elderly SP. Meanwhile, an OSCE had to be delivered using adapted cases that minimized physical contact between candidates and SP. Short of suitable cases at such short notice, the case of an elderly patient with postural instability had to be added to the exam blueprint. With elderly SP off the roster, it was decided to use makeup effects to achieve visual authenticity. A combination of wigs (grey hair, hairdo), 3D Probondo transfers (forehead wrinkles), old age stipple (crow's feet), and colouring (age spots) were used to achieve the old-age effects, while SPs wore scarves to cover their neckline. The lower face was covered with protective face masks in accordance with the exam's Covid-19 hygiene protocol. Case-related feedback from candidates and examiners was analysed for any direct or indirect remark attributable to the ageing effects. As no comment touched upon the subject of the appearance of age, this was interpreted as success, as any distracting effect from the SPs' appearance in this regard would surely have prompted remarks or even complaints. The SPs' feedback revealed how applying the ageing effects helped them adopt the octogenarian's role. This report explains how SP in their fifties were made fit for an octogenarian's case in an OSCE using makeup effects. The effort required for the ageing simulation was considerable, but it is hoped that in future, with more planning time, the amount of effort required can be reduced. The feedback obtained from the candidates suggest the appearance of SPs was not experienced as a distraction, which was the primary objective of this exercise. Adapting our approach to their own contexts allows educators to include cases with elderly patients in their OSCE that cannot be re-written for younger SP, so long as Covid-19 prevents elderly SP from participating.","Bauer, Daniel; Germano, Miria; Stierlin, Johanna; Brem, Beate; Stöckli, Yvette; Schnabel, Kai P",GMS J Med Educ,,359

METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of 622 youth aged 14 to 28 was conducted. Analyses were conducted to understand the changes in mental and physical health among youth in four groups: (a) participants with a friend or family member diagnosed with COVID-19, (b) participants with symptoms associated with COVID-19, (c) participants with atopic conditions (asthma and allergies), and (d) participants with other preexisting physical health conditions. RESULTS: Many participants with physical health concerns met screening criteria for an internalizing disorder, which was significantly higher than the rate found among participants without physical health conditions. Significantly greater declines in self-reported mental health were observed during the COVID-19 period compared to 3 months earlier among youth reporting physical health concerns compared to those without physical health concerns. Substance use does not appear to have been affected. CONCLUSIONS: Mental health concerns are highly prevalent among youth with physical health concerns, and also appear to be exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Physical health concerns appear to constitute risk factors for heightened mental health responses to the pandemic situation.

Initially thought to be restricted to the respiratory system, we now understand that coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) also involves multiple other organs, including the central and peripheral nervous system. The number of recognized neurologic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection is rapidly accumulating. These may result from a variety of mechanisms, including virus-induced hyperinflammatory and hypercoagulable states, direct virus infection of the central nervous system (CNS), and postinfectious immune mediated processes. Example of COVID-19 CNS disease include encephalopathy, encephalitis, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, meningitis, ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, venous sinus thrombosis, and endothelialitis. In the peripheral nervous system, COVID-19 is associated with dysfunction of smell and taste, muscle injury, the Guillain-Barre syndrome, and its variants. Due to its worldwide distribution and multifactorial pathogenic mechanisms, COVID-19 poses a global threat to the entire nervous system.

These require states to (i) help ensure that people have affordable access to the internet, as well as opportunities for learning how to use this medium so as that they can digitally connect to others; (ii) help people to have harmonious and rewarding intimate relationships; and try to make (iii) non-human companionship as well as (iv) various non-social solutions to loneliness widely available.","de Vries, Bouke",Kennedy Inst Ethics J,,359

The immunopathological characteristics of patients with COVID-19, either systemic or local, have not been thoroughly studied. In the present study, we analysed both the changes in the number of various immune cell types as well as cytokines important for immune reactions and inflammation. Our data indicate that patients with severe COVID-19 exhibited an overall decline of lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells and natural killer cells. The number of immunosuppressive regulatory T cells was moderately increased in patients with mild COVID-19. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10 and C-reactive protein were remarkably up-regulated in patients with severe COVID-19. In conclusion, our study shows that the comprehensive decrease of lymphocytes, and the elevation of IL-6, IL-10 and C-reactive protein are reliable indicators of severe COVID-19.","Tan, Mingkai; Liu, Yanxia; Zhou, Ruiping; Deng, Xilong; Li, Fang; Liang, Kaiyan; Shi, Yaling",Immunology,,359

Among the health targets, SDG 3.2 is to end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age by 2030. These 2 targets aim to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1000 live births. Ethiopia is demonstrating a great reduction in child mortality since 2000. In the 2019 child mortality estimation which is nearly 5 years after SDGs adoption, Ethiopia's progress toward reducing the newborns and under-5 mortality lie at 27 and 50.7 per 1000 live births, respectively. The generous financial and technical support from the global partners have helped to achieve such a significant reduction. Nevertheless, the SDG targets for newborns and under-5 mortality reduction are neither attained yet nor met the national plan to achieve by the end of 2019/2020. The partnership dynamics during COVID-19 crisis and the pandemic itself may also be taken as an opportunity to draw lessons and spur efforts to achieve SDG targets. This urges the need to reaffirm a comprehensive partnership and realignment with other interconnected development goals. Therefore, collective efforts with strong partnerships are required to improve the determinants of child health and achieving SDG target reduction until 2030.","Tefera, Yonas Getaye; Ayele, Asnakew Achaw",J Prim Care Community Health,,359

Though complete lockdown is epidemiologically effective, because it eliminates infectious contacts, it comes with significant costs. Several recent studies have suggested that a plausible compromise strategy for minimizing epidemic risk is periodic closure, in which populations oscillate between wide-spread social restrictions and relaxation. However, no underlying theory has been proposed to predict and explain optimal closure periods as a function of epidemiological and social parameters. In this work we develop such an analytical theory for SEIR-like model diseases, showing how characteristic closure periods emerge that minimize the total outbreak, and increase predictably with the reproductive number and incubation periods of a disease- as long as both are within predictable limits. Using our approach we demonstrate a sweet-spot effect in which optimal periodic closure is maximally effective for diseases with similar incubation and recovery periods. Our results compare well to numerical simulations, including in COVID-19 models where infectivity and recovery show significant variation.","Hindes, Jason; Bianco, Simone; Schwartz, Ira B",PLoS One,,359

BAL fluid collected 19 days after symptoms onset was positive for SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSION: This case highlights importance of clinical suspicion of SARS-CoV-2 infection in diagnosis and infectivity assessment. We suggest collection of BAL fluid when consecutive nasopharyngeal swabs are negative, to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of COVID-19-associated pneumonia.

285534,Surveillance for COVID-19 in Cardiac Inpatients: Containing COVID-19 in a Specialized Cardiac Centre,2020,"BACKGROUND: In the early months of 2020, a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread rapidly from China across multiple countries worldwide. As of March 17, 2020, COVID-19 was officially declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. We collected data on COVID-19 cases outside China during the early phase of the pandemic and used them to predict trends in importations and quantify the proportion of undetected imported cases. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Two hundred and eighty-eight cases have been confirmed out of China from January 3 to February 13, 2020. We collected and synthesized all available information on these cases from official sources and media. We analyzed importations that were successfully isolated and those leading to onward transmission. We modeled their number over time, in relation to the origin of travel (Hubei province, other Chinese provinces, other countries) and interventions. We characterized the importation timeline to assess the rapidity of isolation and epidemiologically linked clusters to estimate the rate of detection. We found a rapid exponential growth of importations from Hubei, corresponding to a doubling time of 2.8 days, combined with a slower growth from the other areas. We predicted a rebound of importations from South East Asia in the successive weeks. Time from travel to detection has considerably decreased since first importation, from 14.5 ± 5.5 days on January 5, 2020, to 6 ± 3.5 days on February 1, 2020. However, we estimated 36% of detection of imported cases. This study is restricted to the early phase of the pandemic, when China was the only large epicenter and foreign countries had not discovered extensive local transmission yet. Missing information in case history was accounted for through modeling and imputation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that travel bans and containment strategies adopted in China were effective in reducing the exportation growth rate. However, the risk of importation was estimated to increase again from other sources in South East Asia. Surveillance and management of traveling cases represented a priority in the early phase of the epidemic. With the majority of imported cases going undetected (6 out of 10), countries experienced several undetected clusters of chains of local transmissions, fueling silent epidemics in the community. These findings become again critical to prevent second waves, now that countries have reduced their epidemic activity and progressively phase out lockdown.","Pinotti, Francesco; Di Domenico, Laura; Ortega, Ernesto; Mancastroppa, Marco; Pullano, Giulia; Valdano, Eugenio; Boëlle, Pierre-Yves; Poletto, Chiara; Colizza, Vittoria",PLoS Med,,359

Three phases of the pandemic were identified based on the epidemiological situation and the public measures adopted from the Italian Government (1st phase: from 9th March to 3rd May 2020; 2nd phase: from 4th May to 14th June; 3rd phase: from 15th June to 31st). The patients operated upon during these phases were compared to those who underwent surgery during the same period of the previous year. Overall, 3892 patients from 28 Italian endocrine surgical units were included in the study, 1478 (38%) operated upon during COVID-19 pandemic, and 2414 (62%) during the corresponding period of 2019. The decrease in the number of operations was by 64.8%, 44.7% and 5.1% during the three phases of COVID-19 pandemic, compared to 2019, respectively. During the first and the second phases, the surgical activity was dedicated mainly to oncological patients. No differences in post-operative complications were noted between the two periods.

SETTING: Between May and June 2020 clinicians from 70 countries were surveyed; majority from Europe (n=196; 39%) with 1846 COVID-19 cases per million people, Australia (AUS)/New Zealand (NZ) (n=188; 38%) with 267/236 per million and Asia (n=75; 15%) with 121 per million at time of survey distribution. PARTICIPANTS: Medical oncologists (n=372; 74%), radiation oncologists (n=91; 18%) and surgical oncologists (n=38; 8%). RESULTS: Eighty-nine per cent of clinicians reported altering clinical practices; more commonly among those with versus without patients diagnosed with COVID-19 (n=142; 93% vs n=225; 86%, p=0.03) but regardless of community transmission levels (p=0.26).

The reported proportion of consultations using telehealth increased by 7.7-fold, with 25.1% (n=108) of clinicians concerned that patient survival would be worse due to this increase. Clinicians reviewed a median of 10 fewer outpatients/week (including non-face to face) compared with prior to the pandemic, translating to 5010 fewer specialist oncology visits per week among the surveyed group. Mental health was negatively impacted for 52.6% (n=190) of clinicians. CONCLUSION: Clinicians reported widespread changes to oncology services, in regions of both high and low COVID-19 case numbers.

286606,Considerations and Strategies for Restarting Elective Spine Surgery in the Midst of a Pandemic of COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: COVID-19-related social isolation and stress may have significant mental health effects, including post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression. These factors are thought to disproportionately affect populations at risk of psychopathology, such as adolescents with a history of childhood adversity (CA). Therefore, examining which factors may buffer the impact of COVID-19-related stress and isolation in vulnerable adolescents is critical. The Resilience After the COVID-19 Threat (REACT) study assesses whether emotion regulation capacity, inflammation and neuroimmune responses to stress induced in the laboratory prior to the pandemic predict responses to COVID-19-related social isolation and stress in adolescents with CA. We aim to elucidate the mechanisms that enable vulnerable adolescents to maintain or regain good mental health when confronted with COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We recruited 79 adolescents aged 16-26 with CA experiences from the Resilience After Individual Stress Exposure study in which we assessed emotion regulation, neural and immune stress responses to an acute stress task. Our sample completed questionnaires at the start of the UK lockdown ('baseline'; April 2020) and three (July 2020) and 6 months later (October 2020) providing crucial longitudinal information across phases of the pandemic progression and government response. The questionnaires assess (1) mental health, (2) number and severity of life events, (3) physical health, (4) stress perception and (5) loneliness and friendship support. We will use multilevel modelling to examine whether individual differences at baseline are associated with responses to COVID-19-related social isolation and stress. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the Cambridge Psychology Research Ethics Committee (PRE.2020.037). Results of the REACT study will be disseminated in publications in scientific peer-reviewed journals, presentations at scientific conferences and meetings, publications and presentations for the general public, and through social media.","Smith, Alicia Joanne; Moreno-López, Laura; Davidson, Eugenia; Dauvermann, Maria; Orellana, Sofia; Soneson, Emma; Ioannidis, Konstantinos; Kaser, Muzaffer; van Harmelen, Anne-Laura",BMJ Open,,359

METHOD: This study was conducted between August and October 2020, we performed COVID-19 testing by RT-PCR on the samples from varying prevalence of rural population (non-hot spot) referred to COVID laboratory, in the first step, the samples were collated into pools of 5 or 10. These pools were tested by RT-PCR. Negative pools were reported as negative whereas positive pools of 5 and 10 were then de-convoluted and each sample was tested individually. RESULTS: In the present study, we tested 1580 samples in 158 pools of 10 and 17,515 samples in 3503 pools of 5. Among 10 samples pool, 11 (13%) pools flagged positive in the first step. In the second step, among 11 pools (110 samples) de-convoluted strategy was followed in which 10 individual samples came positive. Among 5 samples pool, 164 (13%) pools flagged positive in the first step. In the second step, among 164 pools (820 samples) de-convoluted strategy was followed in which 171 individual samples came positive. The pooled sample testing strategy saves substantial resources and time during surge testing and enhanced pandemic surveillance. This approach requires around 76%-93% fewer tests in low to moderate prevalence settings and group sizes up to 5-10 in a population, compared to individual testing. CONCLUSION: Pooled sample RT- PCR analysis strategies can save substantial resources and time for COVID-19 mass testing in comparison with individual testing without compromising the quality of outcome of the test. In particular, the pooled sample approach can facilitate mass screening in the early asymptomatic stages of COVID-19 infections.","Shukla, Surabhi; Upadhyay, Vandana; Maurya, Vinod Kumar",Indian J Med Microbiol,,359

288684,Focused Review: Potential Rare and Atypical Symptoms as Indicator for Targeted COVID-19 Screening,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases (CCVDs) are the leading cause of maternal mortality in the first year after delivery. Women whose pregnancies were complicated by pre-eclampsia are at particularly high risk for adverse events. In addition, women with a history of pre-eclampsia have higher risk of CCVD later in life. The physiological mechanisms that contribute to increased CCVD risk in these women are not well understood, and the optimal clinical pathways for postpartum CCVD risk reduction are not yet defined. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The Motherhealth Study (MHS) is a prospective cohort study at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC), a quaternary care academic medical centre serving a multiethnic population in New York City. MHS began recruitment on 28 September 2018 and will enrol 60 women diagnosed with pre-eclampsia with severe features in the antepartum or postpartum period, and 40 normotensive pregnant women as a comparison cohort. Clinical data, biospecimens and measures of vascular function will be collected from all participants at the time of enrolment. Women in the pre-eclampsia group will complete an additional three postpartum study visits over 12-24 months. Visits will include additional detailed cardiovascular and cerebrovascular phenotyping. As this is an exploratory, observational pilot study, only descriptive statistics are planned. Data will be used to inform power calculations for future planned interventional studies. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The CUIMC Institutional Review Board approved this study prior to initiation of recruitment. All participants signed informed consent prior to enrolment.

289461,Isolation through rubber dam to prevent COVID-19 exposure during flapless trans-crestal sinus lift procedures,2020,"BACKGROUND: Effective endoscopic management is fundamental for the treatment of extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC). However, current biliary stents that are widely used in clinical practice showed no antitumor effect. Drug-eluting stents (DESs) may achieve a combination of local chemotherapy and biliary drainage to prolong stent patency and improve prognosis. AIM: To develop novel DESs coated with gemcitabine (GEM) and cisplatin (CIS)-coloaded nanofilms that can maintain the continuous and long-term release of antitumor agents in the bile duct to inhibit tumor growth and reduce systemic toxicity. METHODS: Stents coated with different drug-eluting components were prepared by the mixed electrospinning method, with poly-L-lactide-caprolactone (PLCL) as the drug-loaded nanofiber membrane and GEM and/or CIS as the antitumor agents. Four different DESs were manufactured with four drug-loading ratios (5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%), including bare-loaded (PLCL-0), single-drug-loaded (PLCL-GEM and PLCL-CIS), and dual-drug-loaded (PLCL-GC) stents. The drug release property, antitumor activity, and biocompatibility were evaluated in vitro and in vivo to confirm the feasibility and efficacy of this novel DES for ECC. RESULTS: The in vitro drug release study showed the stable, continuous release of both GEM and CIS, which was sustained for over 30 d without an obvious initial burst, and a higher drug-loaded content induced a lower release rate. The drug-loading ratio of 10% was used for further experiments due to its ideal inhibitory efficiency and relatively low toxicity. All drug-loaded nanofilms effectively inhibited the growth of EGI-1 cells in vitro and the tumor xenografts of nude mice in vivo; in addition, the dual-loaded nanofilm (PLCL-GC) had a significantly better effect than the single-drug-loaded nanofilms (P < 0.05). No significant differences in the serological analysis (P > 0.05) or histopathological changes were observed between the single-loaded and drug-loaded nanofilms after stent placement in the normal porcine biliary tract. CONCLUSION: This novel PLCL-GEM and CIS-eluting stent maintains continuous, stable drug release locally and inhibits tumor growth effectively in vitro and in vivo. It can also be used safely in normal porcine bile ducts. We anticipate that it might be considered an alternative strategy for the palliative therapy of ECC patients.","Xiao, Jing-Bo; Weng, Jun-Yong; Hu, Yang-Yang; Deng, Gui-Long; Wan, Xin-Jian",World J Gastroenterol,,359

290352,COVID-19 in Neonates: A Call for Standardized Testing,2020,"Many patients with olfactory disorders were referred during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The aim of this study was to detect outpatient cases with olfactory and taste disorders suspected to mild form of COVID-19 disease in Gorgan city in the north of Iran retrospectively. This study was performed on patients who had the complaints of olfactory disorders during 03/01/2020 to 04/01/2020. They also had the mild symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. The control group included patients who had similar symptoms during this period but did not report olfactory or taste disturbances. Due to the limitations of serologic kits, this study was performed 2-3 months after the onset of symptoms. The number of patients and controls was 72 and 36 respectively. The range and the mean ± SD of patient's age were 21-63 and 39.82 ± 9.82 years. In both groups, 44.44% were male and 55.56% were female. The time interval between the onset of symptoms and the serologic tests in both groups was 91.11 ± 16.20 days. In the cases and controls, the IgG titer was positive in 44.4% and 22.2% and the IgM titer was positive in 5.6% and 8.3% respectively. IgG antibody titers were higher in cases than in the control group (P = 0.024). There was no correlation among antibody titers and the severity of olfactory disturbances, the gender, and the age. The high COVID-19 IgG antibody titer in patients with olfactory disorder during the pandemic can probably be considered as a warning complaint of COVID-19 and may be used for isolation plans.","Taziki Balajelini, Mohammad Hosein; Vakili, Mohammad Ali; Saeidi, Mohsen; Tabarraei, Alijan; Hosseini, Seyed Mehran",SN Compr Clin Med,,359

Due to global travel, the new coronavirus has rapidly spread worldwide. This article aims to provide an overview of the challenges in implementing measures in the air and maritime transport sector from the perspective of the German Public Health Service (Öffentlicher Gesundheitsdienst, ÖGD). Significant events and measures for air and maritime transport between January and August 2020 were selected. Lessons learned are discussed.During the COVID-19 pandemic, the ÖGD has been operating in a field of tension between the dynamics of scientific knowledge, political decision-making, social acceptance and consent.There are specific challenges at points of entry such as airports and seaports. These include staff shortages and the need to implement measures with a high organisational effort at very short notice such as health authority passenger checks carried out on aircraft, the establishment of test centres at points of entry and control of compliance with quarantine measures. Aggravating the situation, passenger lists, which are necessary for effective contact tracing, are often not available or incomplete. There is also a lack of digital tools for contact tracing but also, for example, the exchange of personal data within the ÖGD. Further difficulties in outbreak management arise from the cramped conditions on board ships and from the potential psychological stress on crew members and passengers, which have not yet been sufficiently considered.In view of all these challenges, it is paramount to strengthen the German Public Health Service in general and at points of entry and to intensify the exchange between the national, federal state and local levels.","Kleine-Kampmann, Scarlett; Schöll, Meike; Ehlers, Lena; Hewelt, Elisabeth; Götsch, Udo; Göbels, Klaus; Ippisch, Siegfried; Seidel, Juliane; Thanheiser, Marc; Schindler, Bert; Kalkowski, Mathias; Boldt, Matthias; Dirksen-Fischer, Martin; von Münster, Thomas; Jeglitza, Matthias; Chmielewska, Justyna; Sangs, André; Mouchtouri, Barbara; Rexroth, Ute; An der Heiden, Maria",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,,359

It is a strong irritant and considered a weak sensitizer. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the temporal trend of BAK sensitization and the demographics of sensitized patients. METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective study of 7390 patients who were patch tested with BAK between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2019. RESULTS: Of the 7390 patients who were patch tested to BAK, 108 (1.5%) had a positive reaction, with 21 reactions deemed clinically relevant (0.3% of total patch tested) and a further 5 doubtful reactions deemed clinically relevant, resulting in a total of 26 relevant reactions (0.4% of total patch tested). Common sources of exposure were ophthalmic drops (30.8%), topical antiseptic preparations (26.9%), cosmetics (15.4%), disinfectant solutions (11.5%), hand sanitizers (11.5%), and hand washes (7.7%). One fifth of patients with relevant reactions were health care workers. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of positive reactions since 2017, for reasons not totally clear. CONCLUSION: Contact allergy (CA) and allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) in response to BAK are now increasing at our center. Awareness of this trend is important, given that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is likely to further expose people to BAK.","Dear, Kate; Palmer, Amanda; Nixon, Rosemary",Contact dermat,,359

292094,Clinical trials of psychological interventions cancelled due to the COVID-19 outbreak: how should we respond?,2020,"The clinical effects of the Covid-19 pandemic are now the subject of numerous studies worldwide. But what are the effects of the quarantine imposed by the states that implemented the measures of lockdown? The present research aims to explore, in a preliminary way, the major stress-related symptoms during the lockdown, due to Covid-19, in the Italian population. Subjects were asked to fill out a survey, that traced a line identifying the most relevant psychophysiological symptoms that took into account factors such as perceived stress, body perception, perceived pain, quality of sleep, perceptive variations (i.e., olfactory, gustatory, visual, acoustic, and haptic perception). A network approach formulating a hypothesis-generating exploratory analysis was adopted. Main results of the network analysis showed that the beliefs of having had the Covid-19 was related to individual variables (i.e., gender, working in presence, sleep quality, anxiety symptoms), while the familiarity of Covid-19 disease was related to contextual factors (e.g., number of recorded cases in the Region, working in presence). The self-perception of olfactory and perceptive alterations highlighted a great sensorial cross-modality, additionally, the olfactory impairment was related to the belief of having had the Covid-19. Compared to general network data, BAI, perceived stress, anxiety and chronic pain were in relation to daily sleep disturbance. Main study's results show how the management of the Covid-19 stressful representation, in its cognitive aspects, can modulate the psychophysiological responses.","Invitto, Sara; Romano, Daniele; Garbarini, Francesca; Bruno, Valentina; Urgesi, Cosimo; Curcio, Giuseppe; Grasso, Alberto; Pellicciari, Maria Concetta; Kock, Giacomo; Betti, Viviana; Fiorio, Mirta; Ricciardi, Emiliano; de Tommaso, Marina; Valeriani, Massimiliano",Front Public Health,,359

BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 (Covid-19) transmission via microdroplet and aerosol-generating procedures presents risk to medical professionals. As the most common elective surgical procedure performed globally; determining contamination risk from phacoemulsification cataract surgery may guide personal protection equipment use. DESIGN: Pilot study involving phacoemulsification cataract surgery on enucleated porcine eyes by experienced ophthalmologists in an ophthalmic operating theatre. PARTICIPANTS: Two ophthalmic surgical teams. METHODS: Standardized phacoemulsification of porcine eyes by two ophthalmologists accompanied by an assistant. Fluorescein incorporated into phacoemulsification irrigation fluid identifying microdroplets and spatter. Contamination documented using a single-lens reflex camera with a 532 nm narrow bandpass (fluorescein) filter, in-conjunction with a wide-field blue light and flat horizontal laser beam (wavelength 532 nm). Quantitative image analysis using Image-J software. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Microdroplet and spatter contamination from cataract phacoemulsification. RESULTS: With phacoemulsification instruments fully within the eye, spatter contamination was limited to <10 cm. Insertion and removal of the phacoemulsification needle and bimanual irrigation/aspiration, with irrigation active generated spatter on the surgeons' gloves and gown extending to >16 cm below the neckline in surgeon 1 and > 5.5 cm below the neckline of surgeon 2. A small tear in the phacoemulsification irrigation sleeve, presented a worse-case scenario the greatest spatter. No contamination above the surgeons' neckline nor contamination of assistant occurred. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Cataract phacoemulsification generates microdroplets and spatter. Until further studies on SARS-CoV-2 transmission via microdroplets or aerosolisation of ocular fluid are reported, this pilot study only supports standard personal protective equipment.","McGhee, Charles N J; Dean, Simon; Freundlich, Simone E N; Gokul, Akilesh; Ziaei, Mohammed; Patel, Dipika V; Niederer, Rachael L; Danesh-Meyer, Helen V",,,359

292845,Implications for forensic death investigations from first Swiss post-mortem CT in a case of non-hospital treatment with COVID-19,2020,"PURPOSE: To investigate whether TGF-ß2 had a different effect on the expression levels of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) in the subconjunctival fibroblasts from glaucoma patients who underwent a reoperation (RGSFs) compared with those from glaucoma patients who underwent first filtering surgery (GSFs) and control patients with cataracts (HSFs). METHODS: Human subconjunctival fibroblasts were obtained from the three groups of patients. Different concentrations of TGF-ß2 were added to the fibroblasts for 1, 3, and 5 days. The proliferation of the fibroblasts was determined by CCK-8 assays. Real-time PCR and western blotting were performed to analyze the mRNA and protein levels of LDLr. The uptake of DiI-labeled LDL was determined by confocal microscopy. RESULTS: The results revealed that under TGF-ß2 exposure, fibroblast proliferation was positively correlated with LDLr expression (all p<0.001). The LDLr mRNA and protein levels were affected by TGF-ß2 in a concentration-dependent and time-dependent manner in the RGSFs, GSFs and HSFs. The maximal expression of LDLr after TGF-ß2 stimulation was consistent with the peak uptake of DiI-LDL, which was obviously highest in the RGSFs, followed by the GSFs, and then the HSFs (all p<0.05). All 3 groups took up DiI-LDL in a similar time-dependent manner, with maximal uptake at 6 h following DiI-LDL incubation (all p<0.05). In addition, there were significant differences in the LDLr protein levels in the subconjunctival tissues isolated from the glaucoma patients during reoperation, the glaucoma patients during first filtering surgery and the control patients at day 3 (p<0.05). The highest protein expression of LDLr was observed in the RG group. CONCLUSION: These data suggested that the RGSFs had the highest LDLr expression and the highest peak uptake of LDL among three groups. The LDLr-drug-LDL delivery system could potentially be used for targeted delivery of antimetabolite agents in anti-scarring therapy for glaucoma patients after filtering surgery.","Wang, Jiajian; Jiang, Chao; Jing, Qinghe; Jiang, Yongxiang; Shao, Tingting",Curr. eye res,,359

The effects of COVID-19-induced inflammation on cancer cells and their microenvironment are yet to be elucidated. Here, we formulate the hypothesis that COVID-19-associated inflammation may generate a microenvironment favorable to tumor cell proliferation and particularly to the reawakening of dormant cancer cells (DCCs). DCCs often survive treatment of primary tumors and populate premetastatic niches in the lungs and other organs, retaining the potential for metastatic outgrowth. DCCs reawakening may be promoted by several events associated to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, including activation of neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages, lymphopenia and an uncontrolled production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Among pro-inflammatory factors produced during COVID-19, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) released by activated neutrophils have been specifically shown to activate premetastatic cancer cells disseminated in the lungs, suggesting they may be involved in DCCs reawakening in COVID-19 patients. If confirmed by further studies, the links between COVID-19, DCCs reactivation and tumor relapse may support the use of specific anti-inflammatory and anti-metastatic therapies in patients with COVID-19 and an active or previous cancer.","Francescangeli, Federica; De Angelis, Maria Laura; Baiocchi, Marta; Rossi, Rachele; Biffoni, Mauro; Zeuner, Ann",Front Oncol,,359

In this paper, we leverage reinforcement learning and optimization to improve upon the allocation strategies for various resources. In particular, we consider a problem where a central controller must decide where to send testing kits to learn about the uncertain states of the world (active learning); then, use the new information to construct beliefs about the states and decide where to allocate resources. We propose a general model coupled with a tunable lookahead policy for making vaccine allocation decisions without perfect knowledge about the state of the world. The lookahead policy is compared to a population-based myopic policy which is more likely to be similar to the present strategies in practice. Each vaccine allocation policy works in conjunction with a testing kit allocation policy to perform active learning. Our simulation results demonstrate that an optimization-based lookahead decision making strategy will outperform the presented myopic policy.","Thul, Lawrence; Powell, Warren",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.01204v1.pdf,359

However, data describing cleaning and disinfection practices within household settings in the United States are limited, particularly concerning those practices intended to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. To provide contextual and behavioral insight into the reported increase in poison center calls and to inform timely and relevant prevention strategies, an opt-in Internet panel survey of 502 U.S. adults was conducted in May 2020 to characterize knowledge and practices regarding household cleaning and disinfection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Knowledge gaps were identified in several areas, including safe preparation of cleaning and disinfectant solutions, use of recommended personal protective equipment when using cleaners and disinfectants, and safe storage of hand sanitizers, cleaners, and disinfectants. Thirty-nine percent of respondents reported engaging in nonrecommended high-risk practices with the intent of preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, such as washing food products with bleach, applying household cleaning or disinfectant products to bare skin, and intentionally inhaling or ingesting these products. Respondents who engaged in high-risk practices more frequently reported an adverse health effect that they believed was a result of using cleaners or disinfectants than did those who did not report engaging in these practices. Public messaging should continue to emphasize evidence-based, safe practices such as hand hygiene and recommended cleaning and disinfection of high-touch surfaces to prevent transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in household settings (2). Messaging should also emphasize avoidance of high-risk practices such as unsafe preparation of cleaning and disinfectant solutions, use of bleach on food products, application of household cleaning and disinfectant products to skin, and inhalation or ingestion of cleaners and disinfectants.","Gharpure, Radhika; Hunter, Candis M; Schnall, Amy H; Barrett, Catherine E; Kirby, Amy E; Kunz, Jasen; Berling, Kirsten; Mercante, Jeffrey W; Murphy, Jennifer L; Garcia-Williams, Amanda G",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,359

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty-seven patients, who already were confirmed with COVID-19 using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), were admitted to our hospital due to chest pain with STEMI. The median patient age was 66 years (range: 27-84 years). Female/male ratio was 22/15. We performed a second RT-PCR test in all patients. We investigated myocardial enzymes (creatine kinase myocardial band (CK-MB), cardiac troponin-I (c-TnI), and C-reactive protein (CRP), and liver enzymes (alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate amino transferase (AST) also were measured. Blood d-dimer, thromboplastin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and fibrinogen were investigated. Transcutaneous oxygen saturation was monitored for each patient in the emergency department (ED). To evaluate myocardial wall abnormalities, transthoracic echocardiography was performed. RESULTS: Coronary artery disorders requiring revascularization were detected in 25 patients (67.5%). There was no evidence of coronary artery disease in the remaining 12 patients. Out of 25, nine coronary artery disease patients had a history of coronary intervention (24.3%). All patients had high levels of myocardial enzyme release. Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) were performed in patients with culprit lesion(s). Success rate of PCI was 87.5% (N = 21). The median number of stent use was 2.9±0.7 (range: 1-4). Because PCI failed in four patients, we suggested elective coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery after medical treatment. Six patients required re-intervention owing to early stent thrombosis (30%). Seven patients died after PCI (33.3%). For patients with negative or positive RT-PCR test results, we performed thoracic computed tomography (CT), which is a sensitive diagnostic method for COVID-19. Interlobular septal and pleural thickening with patchy bronchiectasis in the bilateral or unilaterally lower and/or middle lobe(s) were the main pathologies in 24 patients. D-dimer, fibrinogen, and CRP levels were high in 11 PCI patients with bilaterally pulmonary involvement by COVID-19 (52.3%), while fibrin degradation products did not significantly change. For three patients with normal coronary arteries with a transient hypokinesia or hypokinesia as result of myocarditis, we decided to perform atypical Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. We medically treated using inodilator (levosimendan), diuretic, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers. To prevent the risk of thromboembolism, we also administered a heparin drip. The myocardial contractility of the apex did improve, and patients were discharged from the hospital, with the exception of one young female patient. She is following in the ICU with stabil hemodynamics. CONCLUSION: Chest pain with STEMI can develop in patients with confirmed COVID-19. Nearly one-third of patients had COVID-19 with chest pain and concomitant STEMI and normal coronary angiography (32.4%). Urgent PCI may be performed in hemodynamically unstable patients with high mortality. Complications, including sudden cardiac arrest, severe ventricular arrhythmia, and Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, related to COVID-19 patients with normal coronary arteries.","Keskin, Gökhan; Uysal, Ayhan; Erturk, Esra; Hafiz, Erhan; Dogan, Omer Faruk",Heart Surg Forum,,359
295415,"Resuming endoscopy during COVID-19 pandemic: ESGE, WEO and WGO Joint Cascade Guideline for Resource Limited Settings",2021,"BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: The main aim of this study was to compare coping strategies in obsessive-compulsive patients and a healthy control group during COVID-19 lockdown and to analyze the relationship with some variables which may influence results (depression, anxiety, comorbidity, subtype of obsession-compulsion). Method: There were 237 participants, 122 OCD and 115 healthy controls, aged 17-61 years old (M = 33.48, SD = 11.13). Results: Groups showed differences in the use of some adaptive strategies (positive reinterpretation, acceptance, humor) and maladaptive (denial, self-blame). Within obsessive-compulsive group, comorbidity affected the greater use of inappropriate strategies (denial, substance abuse and self-blame) while type of obsession-compulsion did not influence use. Anxiety and depression levels were related to the use of less adaptive strategies. Conclusions: These findings strengthen the need for training in the use of effective and adaptive coping strategies, making it necessary to improve clinical follow-up of these patients. It is relevant to be in contact with healthcare professionals, review medication and observe the anxiety and depression levels.","Rosa-Alcázar, Ángel; García-Hernández, María Dolores; Parada-Navas, José Luis; Olivares-Olivares, Pablo J; Martínez-Murillo, Sergio; Rosa-Alcázar, Ana I",Int J Clin Health Psychol,,359

This is a narrative review to gather information on all aspects of COVID-19 in elderly patients with cognitive impairment. First, the following three mechanisms have been proposed to underlie the neurological complications associated with COVID-19: 1) direct invasion, 2) immune and inflammatory reaction, and 3) hypoxic brain damage by COVID-19. Next, because the elderly dementia patient population is particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, we discussed risk factors and difficulties associated with cognitive disorders in this vulnerable population. We also reviewed the effects of the patient living environment in COVID-19 cases that required intensive care unit (ICU) care. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of stringent social restrictions and COVID-19 pandemic-mediated policies on dementia patients and care providers. Finally, we provided the following strategies for working with elderly dementia patients: general preventive methods; dementia care at home and nursing facilities according to the activities of daily living and dementia characteristics; ICU care after COVID-19 infection; and public health care system and government response. We propose that longitudinal follow-up studies are needed to fully examine COVID-19 associated neurological complications, such as dementia, and the efficacy of telemedicine/telehealth care programs.","Ryoo, Nayoung; Pyun, Jung Min; Baek, Min Jae; Suh, Jeewon; Kang, Min Ju; Wang, Min Jeong; Youn, Young Chul; Yang, Dong Won; Kim, Seong Yoon; Park, Young Ho; Kim, SangYun",J Korean Med Sci,,359

298488,COVID-19 in the radiology department: What radiographers need to know,2020,"COVID-19 poses an extraordinary threat to global public health and an effective vaccine could provide a key means of overcoming this crisis. Human challenge studies involve the intentional infection of research participants and can accelerate or improve vaccine development by rapidly providing estimates of vaccine safety and efficacy. Human challenge studies of low virulence coronaviruses have been done in the past and human challenge studies with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 have been proposed. These studies of coronaviruses could provide considerable benefits to public health; for instance, by improving and accelerating vaccine development. However, human challenge studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in particular might be controversial, in part, for ethical reasons. The ethical issues raised by such studies thus warrant early consideration involving, for example, broad consultation with the community. This Personal View provides preliminary analyses of relevant ethical considerations regarding human challenge studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, including the potential benefits to public health and to participants, the risks and uncertainty for participants, and the third-party risks (ie, to research staff and the wider community). We argue that these human challenge studies can reasonably be considered ethically acceptable insofar as such studies are accepted internationally and by the communities in which they are done, can realistically be expected to accelerate or improve vaccine development, have considerable potential to directly benefit participants, are designed to limit and minimise risks to participants, and are done with strict infection control measures to limit and reduce third-party risks.","Jamrozik, Euzebiusz; Selgelid, Michael J",Lancet Infect Dis,,359
298528,Emerging COVID-19 Neurological Manifestations: Present Outlook and Potential Neurological Challenges in COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"The non-synonymous mutations of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from across the world have been identified during the last few months. The surface glycoprotein spike of SARS-CoV-2 forms the most important hotspot for amino acid alterations followed by the ORF1a/ORF1ab poly-proteins. It is evident that the D614G mutation in spike glycoprotein and P4715L in RdRp is the important determinant of SARS-CoV-2 evolution since its emergence. P4715L in RdRp, G251V in ORF3a and S1498F of Nsp3 is associated with the epitope loss that may influence pathogenesis caused by antibody escape variants. The phylogenomics distinguished the ancestral viral samples from China and most part of Asia, isolated since the initial outbreak and the later evolved variants isolated from Europe and Americas. The evolved variants have been found to predominant globally with the loss of epitopes from its proteins. These have implications for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, pathogenesis and immune interventions.","Gupta, Aayatti Mallick; Chakrabarti, Jaydeb; Mandal, Sukhendu",Microbes Infect,,359

METHODS: We performed a prospective, multicenter, observational study of adults admitted with ILI during three influenza seasons (2012-2015). Patients were screened for picornavirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, bocavirus, parainfluenza virus, and influenza, by PCR on nasopharyngeal samples. We excluded patients coinfected with NIRV and influenza. RESULTS: Among 1421 patients enrolled, influenza virus was detected in 535 (38%), and NIRV in 215 (15%), mostly picornavirus (n = 61), RSV (n = 53), coronavirus 229E (n = 48), and human metapneumovirus (n = 40). In-hospital mortality was 5% (NIRV), 4% (influenza), and 5% (no respiratory virus). As compared to influenza, NIRV were associated with age (median, 73 years vs. 68, P = 0.026), chronic respiratory diseases (53% vs. 45%, P = 0.034), cancer (14% vs. 9%, P = 0.029), and immunosuppressive drugs (21% vs. 14%, P = 0.028), and inversely associated with diabetes (18% vs. 25%, P = 0.038). On multivariable analysis, only chronic respiratory diseases (OR 1.5 [1.1-2.0], P = 0.008), and diabetes (OR 0.5 [0.4-0.8], P = 0.01) were associated with NIRV detection. CONCLUSIONS: NIRV are common in adults admitted with ILI during influenza seasons.

However, current immunoassays such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) typically involve several complicated steps, and they are not readily adaptable by nonexpert users. Herein, we present a rapid (∼30 min) one-pot, solid-phase immunosensor, based on nanomaterials, by combining a nanometer-thick Au/TiO2 photocatalytic film and Cy5/capture antibody/gold nanorod (GNR) conjugates immobilized on a membrane (the fluorescence of Cy5 was enhanced by the GNR). The one-pot immunoassay is started by adding a drop of a mixture containing 4-chloro-1-naphthol (CN), a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled detection antibody, and an antigen onto the one-pot immunosensor and illuminating UV light. The UV illumination on the Au/TiO2 film results in the production of H2O2, which promotes a CN precipitation reaction. 4-Chloro-1-naphthol precipitates produced by the HRP, which was bound to the conjugates via the antibodies and antigens, could preliminarily quench Cy5 fluorescence via Förster resonance energy transfer, because of their proximity to Cy5. The sensitivity of the developed one-pot immunosensor was similar to that of a commercially available ELISA kit. Given the increasing interest in the early diagnosis of various diseases, including cancers, dementia, and coronavirus disease 2019, the application of nanomaterials such as a porous thin-film photocatalyst and GNR-based fluorescent probes could pave way for the development of next-generation POC biosensors. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","Kim, K.; Jo, E.

The shock to the economy could lead to a deterioration of physical health outcomes, including dental health. The present study investigated the association between worsened socioeconomic conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic and dental pain in Japan. The mediating effects of psychological distress and oral health-related behaviors were also evaluated. Cross-sectional data from the Japan COVID-19 and Society Internet Survey conducted from August to September 2020 (n = 25,482; age range, 15-79 y) were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to evaluate the independent associations of household income reduction, work reduction, and job loss due to the COVID-19 pandemic with dental pain within a month. Dental pain was reported by 9.8%. Household income reduction, work reduction, and job loss were independently associated with dental pain after adjusting for confounders (odds ratios: 1.42 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.28-1.57], 1.58 [95% CI, 1.41-1.76], 2.17 [95% CI, 1.64-2.88], respectively).

However, while there is evidence documenting the growth in discrimination and xenophobia, little is known about how the COVID-19 outbreak is activating the expression of such negative attitudes. The goal of the current paper therefore was to investigate what aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic may be contributing to this rise in expressions of prejudice and xenophobia. More specifically, this study used an experimental design to assess the effects of using stigmatized language to describe the virus as well as the threat to physical health and economic wellbeing posed by the virus on COVID-19 prejudice. Data were collected from a national sample of 1451 adults residing within the United States. Results from 2 × 2 x 2 between-subjects analyses of covariance demonstrated that emphasizing the connection between China and COVID-19, rather than framing the virus neutrally, increased negative attitudes toward Asian Americans, beliefs that resources should be prioritized for Americans rather than immigrants, and general xenophobia. Emphasizing the severity of the economic impact of the virus also increased beliefs that Asian Americans are a threat to resources and general xenophobia. In contrast, messages which emphasized the serious health risks of COVID-19 did not increase bias toward Asian Americans or xenophobia. Our findings suggest that specific types of public health messaging related to infectious diseases, especially framing the virus in terms of its country of origin or its likely economic impact, may elicit prejudice and xenophobia. Public health campaigns that emphasize the severity of the virus, however, are not likely to trigger the same negative attitudes. Implications for public health responses to health crises are discussed.","Dhanani, Lindsay Y; Franz, Berkeley",Soc Sci Med,,359

There is currently a lack of nonspecific laboratory indicators as a quantitative standard to distinguish between the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and an influenza A or B virus infection. Thus, the aim of this study was to establish a nomogram to detect COVID-19. Methods. A nomogram was established using data collected from 457 patients (181 with COVID-19 and 276 with influenza A or B infection) in China. The nomogram used age, lymphocyte percentage, and monocyte count to differentiate COVID-19 from influenza. Results. Our nomogram predicted probabilities of COVID-19 with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.913 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.883-0.937), greater than that of the lymphocyte:monocyte ratio (0.849; 95% CI, 0.812-0.880; P = .0007), lymphocyte percentage (0.808; 95% CI, 0.768-0.843; P &lt; .0001), monocyte count (0.780; 95% CI, 0.739-0.817; P &lt; .0001), or age (0.656; 95% CI, 0.610-0.699; P &lt; .0001). The predicted probability conformed to the real observation outcomes of COVID-19, according to the calibration curves. Conclusions. We found that age, lymphocyte percentage, and monocyte count are risk factors for the early-stage prediction of patients infected with the 2019 novel coronavirus.

303851,Major Complex and Minimally Invasive Cancer Surgery Can Be Delivered Safely During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"Vaccines represent one of the major advances of modern medicine. Despite the many successes of vaccination, continuous efforts to design new vaccines are needed to fight “old” pandemics, such as tuberculosis and malaria, as well as emerging pathogens, such as Zika virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Vaccination aims at reaching sterilizing immunity, however assessing vaccine efficacy is still challenging and underscores the need for a better understanding of immune protective responses. Identifying reliable predictive markers of immunogenicity can help to select and develop promising vaccine candidates during early preclinical studies and can lead to improved, personalized, vaccination strategies. A systems biology approach is increasingly being adopted to address these major challenges using multiple high-dimensional technologies combined with in silico models. Although the goal is to develop predictive models of vaccine efficacy in humans, applying this approach to animal models empowers basic and translational vaccine research. In this review, we provide an overview of vaccine immune signatures in preclinical models, as well as in target human populations. We also discuss high-throughput technologies used to probe vaccine-induced responses, along with data analysis and computational methodologies applied to the predictive modeling of vaccine efficacy.","Van Tilbeurgh, Matthieu Lemdani Katia Beignon Anne-Sophie Chapon Catherine Tchitchek Nicolas Cheraitia Lina Marcos Lopez Ernesto Pascal Quentin Le Grand Roger Maisonnasse Pauline Manet Caroline",Vaccines,,359
304140,COVID-19 severity in relation to sociodemographics and vitamin D use,2021,"Over years, the voting system has been a democratic way to make a collective decision to express an opinion or selecting a leader. In organizations, voting can occur to elect members of the committee or to choose the roles of candidates. At present, in this era of technological advancement, the voting process became a major issue in order to avoid vulnerabilities like missing votes, multiple voting, and miscount in an election. The manual or semi-automated systems of voting are quite a time consuming, inefficient and unfortunately lack security. Moreover, for COVID-19, physical manual vote taking has become colossal. In this paper, a secure android based mobile voting system named 'mVote' is developed for conducting vote at different institutes and organizations during and post-pandemic situation. The usability and usefulness of the 'mVote' mobile application were evaluated through the System Usability Scale (SUS) which was replicated with 75 participants. The findings of the evaluation study showed that the developed 'mVote' application is usable and will help different organizations and institutes to improve the voting experience during and post-pandemic situation. © 2020 IEEE.","Khan, S.

304757,Precautions in neonatal care in the delivery room with a mother suspected or positive for COVID 19,2020,"BACKGROUND Kidney transplant services all over the world were severely impacted by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. The optimum management of kidney transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 remains uncertain. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a multicenter cohort study of kidney transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 infection in Saudi Arabia. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to study predictors of graft and patient outcomes at 28 days after coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis. RESULTS We included 130 kidney transplant recipients, with a mean age of 48.7(±14.4) years. Fifty-nine patients were managed at home with daily follow-up utilizing a dedicated clinic, while 71 (54.6%) required hospital admission. Acute kidney injury occurred in 35 (26.9%) patients. Secondary infections occurred in 38 (29.2%) patients. SARS-CoV-2 antibodies testing was carried out in 84 patients, of whom 70 tested positive for IgG and/or IgM. Fourteen patients died (10.8%). A multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that age, creatinine at presentation, acute kidney injury, and use of azithromycin were significantly associated with worse patient survival. Graft loss was associated with requiring renal replacement therapy and development of secondary infections. CONCLUSIONS Despite kidney transplant recipients with coronavirus disease 2019 infection having higher rate of hospital admission and mortality compared to the general population, a significant number of them can be managed using a telemedicine clinic. Most kidney transplant patients seem to mount an antibody response following coronavirus disease 2019 infection, and it remains to be seen if they will have a similar response to the incoming vaccines.","Alshaqaq, Ali; Al Abadi, Abdulnaser; Altheaby, Abdulrahman; Bukhari, Mohammed A; Alnasrallah, Basil; Alamoudi, Alaa; Arabi, Ziad; Alhejaili, Fayez; Bin Saad, Khalid; Busbaih, Ahmed; Idris, Mohammed Abdelrahim; Askandarani, Sumayah; AlBugami, Meteb M; Alotaibe, Fahad E; Hamawi, Khaled; Akkari, Khalid Bel039; eed,",Ann Transplant,,359

305395,[Editorial] Possibility of transmission through dogs being a contributing factor to the extreme Covid­19 outbreak in North Italy,2020,"OBJECTIVE: During the Covid-19 pandemic, many governments promoted the adoption and development of telework to reduce some of the consequences of the current health crisis on the economy and favor social distancing. The aim of this web-based cross-sectional study was to assess the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic on job organization, exploring the effects of lockdown measures on the psychological distress and perceived well-being of workers experiencing telework. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional survey has been used to collect data. The participants answered the questionnaire from April 1 to April 30, 2020. The questionnaire consisted of three sections, which investigated: 1) demographic and occupational variables, 2) lifestyle and habits variables, 3) psychological distress and perceived well-being. The General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) has been used to evaluate psychological distress and the 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5) to explore subjective well-being. RESULTS: Psychological distress was associated with educational level, with habits, and with reporting poor well-being. Poor well-being was associated with a higher job demand during pandemic, lifestyle and habits variables, and psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies exploring the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown measures on the perceived well-being and psychological distress of workers experiencing telework. It is mandatory to pay more and more attention to the mental health of teleworkers, considering the increasing diffusion and adoption of this type of work organization.","De Sio, S; Cedrone, F; Nieto, H A; Lapteva, E; Perri, R; Greco, E; Mucci, N; Pacella, E; Buomprisco, G",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,359

Evidences suggest that COVID-19 could trigger cardiovascular complications in apparently healthy patients. Coronaviruses are enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses acting as a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP)/ danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMP). Interestingly, Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 recognize both PAMPs DAMPs and is activated by viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) leading to activation of TIR receptor domain-containing adaptor inducing IFN-ß (TRIF) dependent pathway. New evidence has shown a link between virus dsRNA and increased BP. Hence, we hypothesize that COVID-19 infection may be over activating the TLR3 through dsRNA, evoking further damage to the patients, leading to vascular inflammation and increased blood pressure, favoring the development of several cardiovascular complications, including hypertension.","Dela Justina, Vanessa; Giachini, Fernanda R; Priviero, Fernanda; Webb, R Clinton",Vascul Pharmacol,,359
307864,"A Master Autoantigen-ome Links Alternative Splicing, Female Predilection, and COVID-19 to Autoimmune Diseases",2021,"BACKGROUND: Polyethylene glycols (PEGs) are widely used as excipients in drugs, cosmetics and household products. Immediate-type allergy to PEGs including anaphylaxis is rare. The recent introduction of the mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines has led to an increased focus on PEG as a possible culprit of allergic reactions to the vaccines. A low awareness of the allergenic potential of PEG among consumers, manufacturers and doctors leads to under-diagnosis and under-reporting of allergy to PEGs, putting patients at risk of repeated severe reactions. OBJECTIVES: To investigate clinical manifestations, time to diagnosis and impact of a PEG allergy diagnosis on the daily life of patients diagnosed with allergy to PEG from 2010 to 2019. METHOD: Ten patients diagnosed with allergy to PEG were included. Detailed clinical history was obtained, and allergy investigations had been performed at the time of diagnosis. All patients were contacted and asked to retrospectively complete a questionnaire about causes and impact on daily life of an allergy to PEG, scored on a likert scale (0-10) before and after diagnosis. RESULTS: Eight patients had experienced at least one anaphylactic reaction requiring adrenaline treatment. Anaphylaxis was primarily caused by antibiotic/analgesic tablets, depot-steroids, antacids and laxatives. Seven patients reported repeated reactions before diagnosis (median 3, range 2-6). Median time from first reaction to diagnosis was 20 months (range 2-120). None of the patients experienced severe allergic reactions after the diagnosis. Median likert score of the impact on daily life before diagnosis was 7 compared with 4 after diagnosis. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The clinical manifestations of PEG allergy are often dramatic. Improved awareness about the clinical presentation and common culprits, clear product labelling and a standardized nomenclature is needed to ensure the timely diagnosis of PEG allergy to prevent repeated anaphylactic reactions with severe impact on patients' lives.","Bruusgaard-Mouritsen, Maria A; Johansen, Jeanne D; Garvey, Lene H",Clin. exp. allergy,,359

308310,Evidence Supporting a Phased Immuno-physiological Approach to COVID-19 From Prevention Through Recovery,2020,"BACKGROUND: Recently, three randomized clinical trials on COVID-19 treatments were completed, one for lopinavir-ritonavir and two for remdesivir. One trial reported that remdesivir was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery, while the other two showed no benefit of the treatment under investigation. OBJECTIVE: From statistical perspectives, we identify several key issues in the design and analysis of three COVID-19 trials and reanalyze the data from the cumulative incidence curves in the three trials using more appropriate statistical methods. METHODS: The lopinavir-ritonavir trial enrolled 39 additional patients due to insignificant results after the sample size reached the planned number, which led to inflation of the type I error rate. The remdesivir trial of Wang et al. failed to reach the planned sample size due to a lack of eligible patients, while the bootstrap method was used to predict the quantity of clinical interest conditionally and unconditionally if the trial had continued to reach the originally planned sample size. Moreover, we used a terminal (or cure) rate model and a model-free metric known as the restricted mean survival time or the restricted mean time to improvement (RMTI) to analyze the reconstructed data. The remdesivir trial of Beigel et al. reported the median recovery time of the remdesivir and placebo groups and the rate ratio for recovery, while both quantities depend on a particular time point representing local information. We use the restricted mean time to recovery (RMTR) as a global and robust measure for efficacy. RESULTS: For the lopinavir-ritonavir trial, with the increase of sample size from 160 to 199, the type I error rate was inflated from 0.05 to 0.071. The difference of RMTIs between the two groups evaluated at day 28 was -1.67 days (95% CI [-3.62, 0.28]; P=.09) in favor of lopinavir-ritonavir but not statistically significant. For the remdesivir trial of Wang et al., the difference of RMTIs at day 28 was -0.89 day (95% CI [-2.84, 1.06]; P=.37). The planned sample size was 453, yet only 236 patients were enrolled. The conditional prediction shows that the HR estimates would reach statistical significance if the target sample size had been maintained. For the remdesivir trial of Beigel et al., the difference of RMTRs between the remdesivir and placebo groups at day 30 was -2.7 days (95% CI [-4.0, -1.2]; P<.001), confirming the superiority of remdesivir. The difference in the recovery time at the 25th percentile (95% CI [-3, 0]; P=.65) was insignificant, while the differences manifested to be statistically significant at larger percentiles.

Our preliminary deep sequencing analysis showed altered expression of CTBP1-AS2 in osteoarthritis (OA). In addition, CTBP1-AS2 was inversely correlated with miR-130a. This study was therefore carried out to investigate the interactions between CTBP1-AS2 and miR-130a in OA. METHODS: Synovial fluid was collected from 62 OA patients and 62 healthy controls. RT-qPCR was performed to determine the expression levels of CTBP1-AS2 and miR-130a in synovial fluid. Cell transfections were performed to investigate the interactions between CTBP1-AS2 and miR-130a. Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was performed to assess the effects of CTBP1-AS2 on the methylation of miR-130a. Cell counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was performed to evaluate the roles of CTBP1-AS2 and miR-130a in regulating proliferation of chondrocytes. RESULTS: The results showed that CTBP1-AS2 was upregulated in OA and inversely correlated with miR-130a. In chondrocytes of OA patients, overexpression of CTBP1-AS2 led to increased methylation of miR-130a gene and downregulated expression of miR-130a, while overexpression of miR-130a did not affect the expression of CTBP1-AS2. In contrast, no interaction between CTBP1-AS2 and miR-130a was observed in chondrocytes from healthy adults. Analysis of chondrocyte proliferation showed that overexpression of miR-130a led to increased proliferation rate of chondrocytes extracted from OA patients. Overexpression of CTBP1-AS2 led to decreased proliferation rate of chondrocytes and reversed the effects of overexpressing miR-130a. CONCLUSION: Therefore, CTBP1-AS2 is upregulated in OA and may increase the methylation of miR-130a gene to inhibit chondrocyte proliferation.Key Pointsâ¢ CTBP1-AS2 is overexpressed in OA and may downregulate miR-130a through methylation to suppress the proliferation of chondrocytes.â¢ The interaction between CTBP1-AS2 and miR-130a is indirect and mediated by certain pathological mediators.","Zhang, Hongfei; Li, Jinglian; Shao, Weiguang; Shen, Naipeng",Clin. rheumatol,,359
308320,Between Intestinal Hydrogen and COVID-19: A Blessing in Disguise for Asians and Blood Type O?,2020,"BACKGROUND: The uncertainty about COVID-19 outcomes in angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) users continues with contradictory findings. This study aimed to determine the effect of ACEI/ARB use in patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was done in two Saudi public specialty hospitals designated as COVID-19 referral facilities. We included 354 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 between April and June 2020, of which 146 were ACEI/ARB users and 208 were non-ACEI/ARB users. Controlling for confounders, we conducted multivariate logistic regression and sensitivity analyses using propensity score matching (PSM) and Inverse propensity score weighting (IPSW) for high-risk patient subsets. RESULTS: Compared to non-ACEI/ARB users, ACEI/ARB users had an eight-fold higher risk of developing critical or severe COVID-19 (OR = 8.25, 95%CI = 3.32-20.53); a nearly 7-fold higher risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission (OR = 6.76, 95%CI = 2.88-15.89) and a nearly 5-fold higher risk of requiring noninvasive ventilation (OR = 4.77,95%CI = 2.15-10.55). Patients with diabetes, hypertension, and/or renal disease had a five-fold higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease (OR = 5.40,95%CI = 2.0-14.54]. These results were confirmed in the PSM and IPSW analyses. CONCLUSION: In general, but especially among patients with hypertension, diabetes, and/or renal disease, ACEI/ARB use is associated with a significantly higher risk of severe or critical COVID-19 disease, and ICU care.","Alrashed, Ahmed A; Khan, Tahir M; Alhusseini, Noara K; Asdaq, Syed Mohammed Basheeruddin; Enani, Mushira; Alosaimi, Bandar; Alkhani, Nada M; Mohzari, Yahya; Alghalbi, Maram M; Alfahad, Wafa; Alanazi, Mona A; Albujaidya, Asma S; Ben-Akresh, Amal; Almutairi, Malak; Abraham, Ivo; Alamer, Ahmad",J Infect Public Health,,359

The city of São Paulo is particularly vulnerable because it is the most populated city in Brazil. Thus, this study aimed to analyse COVID-19 mortality in a spatiotemporal context in São Paulo, with respect to socio-economic levels. METHOD: We modelled the deaths using spatiotemporal architectures and Poisson probability distributions using a latent Gaussian Bayesian model approach. RESULTS: Both total deaths and confirmed deaths showed similar spatial patterns. Mortality was higher in men and increased with age. The most critical period regarding mortality occurred between the 20th and 23rd epidemiological weeks, followed by an apparent stabilisation of the epidemiological trend. The risk of death was greater in areas with the worst social conditions during the study period. However, this pattern was not uniform over time, since we identified a shift of high risk from the areas with the best socio-economic conditions to those with the worst conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our study corroborated the relationship between COVID-19 mortality and socio-economic conditions, revealing the importance of geographic screening in the integration of better actions to face the pandemic.","Bermudi, Patricia Marques Moralejo; Lorenz, Camila; Aguiar, Breno Souza de; Failla, Marcelo Antunes; Barrozo, Ligia Vizeu; Neto, Francisco Chiaravalloti",Travel Med Infect Dis,,359

309520,Lifestyle at Time of COVID-19: How Could Quarantine Affect Cardiovascular Risk,2020,"This article discusses central bank forward guidance as a performative (Austin) and conative (Jakobson) practice–hence, as a form of audience-centred communication that intends to transform their behaviour when deployed by a narrator who is simultaneously also a character in the story. Taking the European Central Bank (ECB) as its primary example, the article conveys how the double role of narrator and character assumed by this institution renders it more permeable to reactions from the markets and the public. As such, ECB forward guidance is frequently misguided, with its communicative imperatives indeed being ‘corrected’ and ‘reoriented’ by market actors and publics wishing to perceive the European Central Bank as behaving like an impartial and just frontline hero. While acknowledging the presence of conversational features within these reflexive communication practices, the article approaches forward guidance as an unfolding story, not only due to the relevance of the characterisation processes through which the European Central Bank is repositioned as hero or villain by its publics, but also because exemplary episodes exhibit a reminiscent quality that isolates them from their original context and opens them up to the possibility of re-activation–as indeed happened during the recent Covid-19 pandemic crisis. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Abreu, A.; Lopes, D.

An online Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) survey on consecutive congenital heart disease (CHD) patients, was carried out to determine depression during the Spanish coronavirus disease (COVID-19) quarantine. Two-hundred forty-two out of 407 (59%) CHD patients answered the survey, 123 (51%) had mild defects, 88 (36%) moderate and 31 (13%) great defects, most of them between 18 and 24 years old and 51% were male. Patients were dichotomized to no or mild (PHQ-9 < 10) and moderate to severe (≥ 10) depressive symptoms. Thirty-four (14%) patients showed a PHQ-9 ≥ 10 and 10 of them (29%) were under anxiolytic or antidepressant treatment during the quarantine. During the study period, 9 (4%) patients had COVID-19 symptoms. Patients with a NYHA above 2 (P=0.025), living in houses without garden or balcony (P=0.014), needing psychological/psychiatric evaluation/medication in the previous 12 months or being under anxiolytic/antidepres-sant treatment during the confinement had, significantly, a PHQ-9 score ≥ 10 (P < 0.001). Being under anxiolytic/ antidepressant treatment during the coronavirus pandemic [OR 3.92 (95% CI 1.05-14.66), P=0.043] and having previous psychological/psychiatric evaluation in the previous 12 months to the quarantine [OR 3.82 (95% CI 1.16-12.54), P=0.027] were the only variables that reached statistical significance, in the multivariable analysis, as predictors of a pathological PHQ-9 questionnaire (score ≥ 10). In conclusion depression was frequent during the COVID-19 quarantine among CHD patients, with only a third of them being under anxiolytic or antidepressant treat-ment. Needing psychological/psychiatric evaluation/treatment during the previous 12 months to the lockdown was a predictive factor for an abnormal PHQ-9 score.","Martínez-Quintana, E.; Santana-Herrera, D.; Vega-Acedo, L.

309977,Unethical not to Investigate Radiotherapy for COVID-19,2020,"Purpose: Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is required for diagnosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Sensitivity of RT-PCR nasopharyngeal (NP) testing is presumed to be high, but there is no gold standard against which this has been determined. The objective was to determine whether lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), occurs in the absence of upper respiratory tract infection with clinical testing of both specimen types. Methods: Between March 26, 2020 and April 17, 2020 at the University of Washington Medical Center all patients with BALF specimens clinically tested for SARS-CoV-2 were identified. We assessed the proportion of patients with positive RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in BALF after negative NP testing. We describe 3 cases with positive testing in BALF. Results: Among 16 patients with BALF samples, 3 cases (19%) had SARS-CoV-2 detected in BALF. In Case 1, negative NP testing occurred early in the infection and respiratory symptoms may have been missed due to neurologic injury. In Case 2, outpatient diagnosis was aspiration pneumonia, but clinical suspicion remained high for COVID-19 at hospitalization based on epidemiological and clinical features. All 3 cases involved older adults (age &gt;65 years), one of whom was immunosuppressed in the setting of lung transplantation (Case 3). Conclusions: These data demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 LRTI occurs in the presence of negative NP testing. NP testing may underestimate the prevalence of COVID-19 and has implications for spread of SARS-CoV2 in the community and healthcare setting.","Ramos, Kathleen J.; Kapnadak, Siddhartha G.; Collins, Bridget F.; Pottinger, Paul S.; Wall, Richard; Mays, James A.; Perchetti, Garrett A.; Jerome, Keith R.; Khot, Sandeep; Limaye, Ajit P.; Mathias, Patrick C.; Greninger, Alexander",Respir.

A cross-sectional study was conducted between 18 and 31 March 2020. COVID-19 suspected cases admitted to pandemic policlinic, who had nasopharyngeal swab specimens tested for both SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viral pathogens, were included. Among 112 patients, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 34 patients (30%). Among the non-SARS-CoV-2 viruses (n = 25, 22%), metapneumovirus (n = 10) was the most frequent agent. There were two coinfections with SARS-CoV-2. Sputum was less in the SARS-CoV-2 group (P = .003). The leukocyte, lymphocyte, and thrombocyte count and C-reactive protein levels were the lowest in the SARS-CoV-2 group (P < .001, P = .04, P < .001, P = .007, respectively). Peripheral involvement (80% vs 20%; P &#8804; .001), pure ground-glass opacity (65% vs 33%; P = .04), apicobasal gradient (60% vs 40%; P = .08), involvement of greater than or equal to three lobes (80% vs 40%; odds ratio: 6.0; 95% confidence interval: 1.33-27.05; P = .02), and consolidation with accompanying ground-glass opacity (4% vs 33%; P = .031) were more common in SARS-CoV-2 group.

311221,Role of Proteolytic Enzymes In the Covid-19 Infection And Promising Therapeutic Approaches,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic posed unique challenges to medical teams in general and in the field of obstetrics in particular, where the provision of medical services could not be postponed. Optimal care during the COVID-19 outburst required rapid adjustment to changes, ensuring staff and patients' safety while maintaining close and direct contact with patients. OBJECTIVES: To explore obstetricians' experiences during the first outburst, focusing on their challenges, needs and ways of coping. METHODS: Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted online with 13 senior physicians and residents (7 women, 6 men) from four hospitals, who worked in obstetrics. The interviews were analyzed using the Immersion/Crystallization method developed in medicine focused on their experiences. RESULTS: The findings revealed that alongside the impressive mobilization of the teams during this period, physicians encountered various challenges. These included being overwhelmed with the ever-changing and often conflicting guidelines;a feeling of lack of transparency and loss of trust in the system that did not always protect them nor provided their basic needs;difficulty in maintaining daily needed routines, such as communication within the team;dealing with patients' and their families anxiety;and striving to maintain a positive childbirth atmosphere along with having to set boundaries and keep distance. The teams felt the need for training in dealing with patients' and staff's emotional needs as well as finding ways to maintain a professional-friendly relationship among team members. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 period forced obstetricians to change procedures and conduct themselves differently. They demonstrated a great commitment to assuring that women have a positive childbirth experience, even within the limitations of COVID. They experienced great difficulty as they themselves were dealing with fears of the virus, distancing from others, and addressing new emerging needs. DISCUSSION: Reports from around the world and the findings of the current study indicate the importance of developing processes that will enhance physicians' and patients' trust, to allow physicians to feel safe and cared for and to be able to provide high-quality care Identifying the challenges, needs and strengths of the medical teams can help in dealing with this and future pandemics. This requires caring for physicians, as individuals, as family members, as team members, along with provision of training that can help them communicate well to provide high-quality safe care.","Karnieli-Miller, O.; Maymon, R.; Benyamini, Y.",Harefuah,,359

The aim is to evaluate the rate of AKI, defined according to Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome guidelines, in a series of critical COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of a single tertiary teaching hospital. METHODS: From April to May 2020, all consecutive critically ill COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU who did not meet exclusion criteria (length of ICU stay <48 h, ESRD requiring dialysis, and patients still hospitalized in ICU at the time of data analysis) were enrolled in this study. Patients were stratified according to the highest AKI stage attained during ICU stay. RESULTS: Sixty-one patients were included in the analysis. AKI was observed in 35/61 patients (57.4%): 25/35 episodes (71.4%) were observed within the first 7 days. AKI was classified as follows: 17.1% stage 1, 25.7% stage 2, and 57.2% stage 3. Fourteen out of 20 stage-3 patients required continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT), mostly related to persistent oliguria. The overall ICU mortality was 68.9%, and it was higher in patients developing AKI if compared to no-AKI patients (p = 0.006). Renal function recovery of any grade was observed in 14 out of 35 AKI patients (40%). Among patients undergoing CRRT, 13 patients were still dialysis dependent at the time of death. CONCLUSION: In critical COVID-19 patients, ICU mortality is particularly high, especially in patients developing AKI. An accurate monitoring of renal function in early phases of respiratory failure should be ensured in order to timely apply any strategy aimed at limiting renal complications during ICU stay.","Alessandri, Francesco; Pistolesi, Valentina; Manganelli, Chiara; Ruberto, Franco; Ceccarelli, Giancarlo; Morabito, Santo; Pugliese, Francesco",Blood Purif,,359

The authors discuss the structure and efficacy of the U.S. Navy's response to COVID-19 and evaluate the utility of this endeavor, with the objective of providing future recommendations for managing worldwide healthcare and medical operational demands from the perspective of Navy Neurosurgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors present an extensive review of topics and objectively highlight the efforts of U.S. Navy Neurosurgery as it pertains to the humanitarian mission during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: During the humanitarian mission (March 27, 2020-April 14, 2020), the response of active duty and reserve neurosurgeons in the U.S. Navy was robust. Neurosurgical coverage was present on board the U.S. Navy Ships Mercy and Comfort, with additional neurosurgical deployment to New York City for intensive care unit management and coverage. CONCLUSIONS: The U.S. Navy neurosurgical response to the COVID-19 pandemic was swift and altruistic. Although neurosurgical pathologies were limited among the presenting patients, readiness and manpower continue to be strong influences within the Armed Forces. The COVID-19 response demonstrates that neurosurgical assets can be rapidly mobilized and deployed in support of wartime, domestic, and global humanitarian crises to augment both trauma and critical care capabilities.","Ravindra, Vijay M; Dunn, Gavin P; Belverud, Shawn; Carroll, Christopher P; Zuckerman, Scott L; Menger, Richard; Malone, David; Cooke, Jonathon; Porenksy, Paul; Klugh Iii, Arnett; Gilhooly, Jonathan; Tomlin, Jeffrey; Bell, Randy; Ikeda, Daniel S",Mil Med,,359
313115,Suspected COVID-19-related reticulated purpura of the soles in an infant,2020,"BACKGROUND: Adoption and evaluation of contact tracing tools based on information and communications technology may expand the reach and efficacy of traditional contact tracing methods in fighting COVID-19. The Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports initiated and developed CoronaMelder, a COVID-19 contact tracing app. This app is based on a Google/Apple Exposure Notification approach and aims to combat the spread of the coronavirus among individuals by notifying those who are at increased risk of infection due to proximity to someone who later tests positive for COVID-19. The app should support traditional contact tracing by faster tracing and greater reach compared to regular contact tracing procedures. OBJECTIVE: The main goal of this study is to investigate whether the CoronaMelder is able to support traditional contact tracing employed by public health authorities. To achieve this, usability tests were conducted to answer the following question: is the CoronaMelder user-friendly, understandable, reliable and credible, and inclusive? METHODS: Participants (N=44) of different backgrounds were recruited: youth with varying educational levels, youth with an intellectual disability, migrants, adults (aged 40-64 years), and older adults (aged >65 years) via convenience sampling in the region of Twente in the Netherlands. The app was evaluated with scenario-based, think-aloud usability tests and additional interviews. Findings were recorded via voice recordings, observation notes, and the Dutch User Experience Questionnaire, and some participants wore eye trackers to measure gaze behavior. RESULTS: Our results showed that the app is easy to use, although problems occurred with understandability and accessibility. Older adults and youth with a lower education level did not understand why or under what circumstances they would receive notifications, why they must share their key (ie, their assigned identifier), and what happens after sharing. In particular, youth in the lower-education category did not trust or understand Bluetooth signals, or comprehend timing and follow-up activities after a risk exposure notification. Older adults had difficulties multitasking (speaking with a public health worker and simultaneously sharing the key in the app). Public health authorities appeared to be unprepared to receive support from the app during traditional contact tracing because their telephone conversation protocol lacks guidance, explanation, and empathy. CONCLUSIONS: The study indicated that the CoronaMelder app is easy to use, but participants experienced misunderstandings about its functioning. The perceived lack of clarity led to misconceptions about the app, mostly regarding its usefulness and privacy-preserving mechanisms. Tailored and targeted communication through, for example, public campaigns or social media, is necessary to provide correct information about the app to residents in the Netherlands. Additionally, the app should be presented as part of the national coronavirus measures instead of as a stand-alone app offered to the public. Public health workers should be trained to effectively and empathetically instruct users on how to use the CoronaMelder app.","Bente, Britt Elise; 039, van; t Klooster, Jan Willem Jaap Roderick; Schreijer, Maud Annemarie; Berkemeier, Lea; van Gend, Joris Elmar; Slijkhuis, Peter Jan Hendrik; Kelders, Saskia Marion; van Gemert-Pijnen, Julia Elisabeth Wilhelmina Cornelia",JMIR Form Res,,359

The goal of this article is to pre-empt some of the potential implications of these developments, and propose a set of guidelines for evaluating the (moral and) ethical consequences of affectively-aware AI, in order to guide researchers, industry professionals, and policy-makers. We propose a multi-stakeholder analysis framework that separates the ethical responsibilities of AI Developers vis-\`a-vis the entities that deploy such AI -- which we term Operators. Our analysis produces two pillars that clarify the responsibilities of each of these stakeholders: Provable Beneficence, which rests on proving the effectiveness of the AI, and Responsible Stewardship, which governs responsible collection, use, and storage of data and the decisions made from such data. We end with recommendations for researchers, developers, operators, as well as regulators and law-makers.","Ong, Desmond C.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13734v1.pdf,359

This kind of selectivity in electrocyclic reactions is mostly due to strong orbital interactions, particularly when they involve powerful electron donors and acceptors, which also combine with usually milder steric effects. Orbital interactions are established between the cleaving C-C bond and the HOMO/LUMO of the EDG/EWG substituent. This implies that the larger torquoselectivity-featuring substrates may also suffer stronger solvation effects due to the higher polarity imposed by the substituent. This premise is tested and the source of solvation effects as a consequence of substitution analyzed.","Saadat, Kayvan; Villar López, Roberto; Shiri, Ali; Nieto Faza, Olalla; Silva López, Carlos",Org. biomol. chem,,359

315387,The seXY side of COVID-19: what is behind female protection?,2020,"The exposure and consumption of information during epidemic outbreaks may alter risk perception, trigger behavioural changes, and ultimately affect the evolution of the disease. It is thus of the uttermost importance to map information dissemination by mainstream media outlets and public response. However, our understanding of this exposure-response dynamic during COVID-19 pandemic is still limited. In this paper, we provide a characterization of media coverage and online collective attention to COVID-19 pandemic in four countries: Italy, United Kingdom, United States, and Canada. For this purpose, we collect an heterogeneous dataset including 227,768 online news articles and 13,448 Youtube videos published by mainstream media, 107,898 users posts and 3,829,309 comments on the social media platform Reddit, and 278,456,892 views to COVID-19 related Wikipedia pages. Our results show that public attention, quantified as users activity on Reddit and active searches on Wikipedia pages, is mainly driven by media coverage and declines rapidly, while news exposure and COVID-19 incidence remain high. Furthermore, by using an unsupervised, dynamical topic modeling approach, we show that while the attention dedicated to different topics by media and online users are in good accordance, interesting deviations emerge in their temporal patterns. Overall, our findings offer an additional key to interpret public perception/response to the current global health emergency and raise questions about the effects of attention saturation on collective awareness, risk perception and thus on tendencies towards behavioural changes.","Gozzi, Nicolo; Tizzani, Michele; Starnini, Michele; Ciulla, Fabio; Paolotti, Daniela; Panisson, Andr'e; Perra, Nicola",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.06446v1.pdf,359

315758,"COVID-19 restrictions and recreational fisheries in Ontario, Canada: Preliminary insights from an online angler survey",2021,"Microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi play essential roles in many application fields, like biotechnique, medical technique and industrial domain. Microorganism counting techniques are crucial in microorganism analysis, helping biologists and related researchers quantitatively analyze the microorganisms and calculate their characteristics, such as biomass concentration and biological activity. However, traditional microorganism manual counting methods, such as plate counting method, hemocytometry and turbidimetry, are time-consuming, subjective and need complex operations, which are difficult to be applied in large-scale applications. In order to improve this situation, image analysis is applied for microorganism counting since the 1980s, which consists of digital image processing, image segmentation, image classification and suchlike. Image analysis-based microorganism counting methods are efficient comparing with traditional plate counting methods. In this article, we have studied the development of microorganism counting methods using digital image analysis. Firstly, the microorganisms are grouped as bacteria and other microorganisms. Then, the related articles are summarized based on image segmentation methods. Each part of the article is reviewed by methodologies. Moreover, commonly used image processing methods for microorganism counting are summarized and analyzed to find common technological points. More than 144 papers are outlined in this article. In conclusion, this paper provides new ideas for the future development trend of microorganism counting, and provides systematic suggestions for implementing integrated microorganism counting systems in the future. Researchers in other fields can refer to the techniques analyzed in this paper.","Zhang, Jiawei; Li, Chen; Rahaman, Md Mamunur; Yao, Yudong; Ma, Pingli; Zhang, Jinghua; Zhao, Xin; Jiang, Tao; Grzegorzek, Marcin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13625v4.pdf,359

To unleash its full potential, end-devices are expected to work in a plug and play fashion, with zero or minimal parameters configuration, still exhibiting excellent energy efficiency. Conversely, our empirical measurements with commercial IoT devices and different operators revealed that parameters setting does impact energy consumption, so proper configuration is necessary. We shed light on this aspect by first illustrating how the nominal standard operational modes map into real current consumption patterns of NB-IoT devices. Further, we investigate which device reported metadata metrics better reflect performance and implement an algorithm to automatically identify device state in current time series logs. Then, we provide a measurement-driven analysis of the energy consumption and network performance of two popular NB-IoT boards under different parameter configurations and with two major western European operators. We observed that energy consumption is mostly affected by the paging interval in Connected state, set by the base station. However, not all operators correctly implement such settings. Furthermore, under the default configuration, energy consumption in not strongly affected by packet size nor by signal quality, unless it is extremely bad. Our observations indicate that simple modifications to the default parameters settings can yield great energy savings.","Michelinakis, Foivos; Al-selwi, Anas Saeed; Capuzzo, Martina; Zanella, Andrea; Mahmood, Kashif; Elmukashfi, Ahmed",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07127v1.pdf,359

No data have been so far reported on the prognostic impact of RASI in patients suffering from ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) during COVID-19 pandemic, which was the aim of the present study. METHODS: STEMI patients treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) and enrolled in the ISACS-STEMI COVID-19 registry were included in the present sub-analysis and divided according to RASI therapy at admission. RESULTS: Our population is represented by 6095 patients, of whom 3654 admitted in 2019 and 2441 in 2020. No difference in the prevalence of SARSCoV2 infection was observed according to RASI therapy at admission (2.5% vs 2.1%, p = 0.5), which was associated with a significantly lower mortality (adjusted OR [95% CI]=0.68 [0.51-0.90], P = 0.006), confirmed in the analysis restricted to 2020 (adjusted OR [95% CI]=0.5[0.33-0.74], P = 0.001). Among the 5388 patients in whom data on in-hospital medication were available, in-hospital RASI therapy was associated with a significantly lower mortality (2.1% vs 16.7%, OR [95% CI]=0.11 [0.084-0.14], p < 0.0001), confirmed after adjustment in both periods. Among the 62 SARSCoV-2 positive patients, RASI therapy, both at admission or in-hospital, showed no prognostic effect. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to investigate the impact of RASI therapy on the prognosis and SARSCoV2 infection of STEMI patients undergoing PPCI during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both pre-admission and in-hospital RASI were associated with lower mortality. Among SARSCoV2-positive patients, both chronic and in-hospital RASI therapy showed no impact on survival.","De Luca, Giuseppe; Cercek, Miha; Okkels Jensen, Lisette; Bushljetikj, Oliver; Calmac, Lucian; Johnson, Tom; Gracida Blancas, Montserrat; Ganyukov, Vladimir; Wojakowski, Wojtek; von Birgelen, Clemens; IJsselmuiden, Alexander; Tuccillo, Bernardo; Versaci, Francesco; Ten Berg, Jurrien; Laine, Mika; Berkout, Tim; Casella, Gianni; Kala, Petr; López Ledesma, Bernabé; Becerra, Victor; Padalino, Roberto; Santucci, Andrea; Carrillo, Xavier; Scoccia, Alessandra; Amoroso, Giovanni; Lux, Arpad; Kovarnik, Tomas; Davlouros, Periklis; Gabrielli, Gabriele; Flores Rios, Xacobe; Bakraceski, Nikola; Levesque, Sébastien; Guiducci, Vincenzo; Kidawa, Michal; Marinucci, Lucia; Zilio, Filippo; Galasso, Gennaro; Fabris, Enrico; Menichelli, Maurizio; Manzo, Stephane; Caiazzo, Gianluca; Moreu, Jose; Sanchis Forés, Juan; Donazzan, Luca; Vignali, Luigi; Teles, Rui; Agostoni, Pierfrancesco; Bosa Ojeda, Francisco; Lehtola, Heidi; Camacho-Freiere, Santiago",Biomed Pharmacother,,359

A present COVID-19 has high transmission rates worldwide, including in small Brazilian cities such as Ijuí. Located in the northwest part of the state of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) and with a population of 83,475, Ijuí was selected as the site of a population-based survey involving 2,222 subjects, from April to June 2020. Subjects were tested for the presence of antibodies against coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and answered questions regarding social distance adherence (SDA), daily preventive routines (DPR), comorbidities, and sociodemographic characteristics. In parallel, the local government registered the official COVID-19 cases in Ijuí, as well as the mobile social distancing index (MSDI). In this study, we demonstrate that there was a decrease in the levels of SDA, DPR and MSDI before the beginning of COVID-19 community transmission in Ijuí. Furthermore, we provide predictions for the number of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths in the city. We conclude that insufficient social distancing, as evidenced by different methods, may be related to the rapid increase of COVID-19 cases in Ijuí. Our study predicts an approaching outbreak of COVID-19 in Ijuí through community spread, which could be avoided or attenuated with increased levels of social distancing among the population.","Heck, Thiago Gomes; Frantz, Rafael Z; Frizzo, Matias Nunes; François, Carlos Henrique Ramires; Ludwig, Mirna Stela; Mesenburg, Marilia Arndt; Buratti, Giovano Pereira; Franz, Lígia Beatriz Bento; Berlezi, Evelise Moraes",PLoS One,,359

This study aimed to systematically review the current situation and public health burden associated with children infected with SARS-CoV2. METHODS: We searched four electronic databases without language limitations. The pooled proportion or odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each analysis to explore the prevalence of asymptomatic infection and coinfection, as well as to assess the sex of SARS-CoV-2-infected children. RESULTS: We obtained data from 14 eligible studies with 410 patients for the meta-analysis. The pooled proportion of asymptomatic infection was 40.45% (95% CI, 24.04-56.85), while coinfection was 10.14% (95% CI, 3.97-16.30), of which Mycoplasma pneumonia (50%; 95% CI, 28.24-71.76) and influenza virus or parainfluenza virus (22.76%; 95% CI, 4.76-40.77) were the most common pathogens. Both male and female children were susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection. And the pooled proportion of family clustering infection was 83.63% (95% CI, 77.54-89.72). CONCLUSION: A high proportion of asymptomatic infections occurs in children infected with SARS-CoV2, who are also susceptible to coinfection regardless of sex. These data affirm the increasing public health burden arising from infected children regarding the causation of asymptomatic infection or misdiagnosis and as a significant contributor to virus spread. The public should pay more attention to children during epidemics and conduct multimethod detection to further effectively identify infected children and control the source of infection.","Zheng, Baojia; Wang, Hui; Yu, Cuixiang",Pediatr Pulmonol,,359

In this paper, we use the CIPP model (Context, Input, Process and Product evaluations) to further investigate interrelations among the context, input and process elements of ERL during the first wave of COVID-19, as the second wave presses towards reconfining. A correlation analysis of 46 variables, based students’ responses (N = 360) to a closed-ended questionnaire shows the crucial importance of motivation and engagement in online classes, as learning enablers or constrainers. These also shape the students’ perception of the role that online classes play in helping them to stay more positive during ERL. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Oliveira, L.; Mesquita, A.; Sequeira, A.; Oliveira, A.; Silva, P.","World Conference on Information Systems and Technologies, WorldCIST 2021",,359
320403,Therapeutic Potentials of Antiviral Plants Used in Traditional African Medicine With COVID-19 in Focus: A Nigerian Perspective,2021,"A new series of ten multifunctional Cinnamoyl-N-acylhydrazone-donepezil hybrids was synthesized and evaluated as multifunctional ligands against neurodegenerative diseases. The molecular hybridization approach was based on the combination of 1-benzyl-4-piperidine fragment from the anti-Alzheimer AChE inhibitor donepezil (1) and the cinnamoyl subunit from curcumin (2), a natural product with remarkable antioxidant, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties, using a N-acylhydrazone fragment as a spacer subunit. Compounds 4a and 4d showed moderate inhibitory activity towards AChE with IC50 values of 13.04 and 9.1 µM, respectively. In addition, compound 4a and 4d showed a similar predicted binding mode to that observed for donepezil in the molecular docking studies. On the other hand, compounds 4a and 4c exhibited significant radical scavenging activity, showing the best effects on the DPPH test and also exhibited a significant protective neuronal cell viability exposed to t-BuOOH and against 6-OHDA insult to prevent the oxidative stress in Parkinson's disease. Similarly, compound 4c was capable to prevent the ROS formation, with indirect antioxidant activity increasing intracellular GSH levels and the ability to counteract the neurotoxicity induced by both OAß1-42 and 3-NP. In addition, ADMET in silico prediction indicated that both compounds 4a and 4c did not show relevant toxic effects. Due to their above-mentioned biological properties, compounds 4a and 4c could be explored as lead compounds in search of more effective and low toxic small molecules with multiple neuroprotective effects for neurodegenerative diseases.","Ortiz, Cindy Juliet Cristancho; Damasio, Caio Miranda; Pruccoli, Letizia; Nadur, Nathália Fonseca; de Azevedo, Luciana Luiza; Guedes, Isabella Alvim; Dardenne, Laurent Emmanuel; Kümmerle, Arthur Eugen; Tarozzi, Andrea; Viegas, Claudio",Neurochem. res,,359

BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has infected thousands of people and placed enormous stress on healthcare system. Apart from being an infectious disease, it may affect human behavior and healthcare resource allocation which potentially cause treatment delay in MI. METHODS: This was a single center cross-sectional observational study. From November 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020, we compared outcome of patients admitted for acute ST-elevation MI (STEMI) and non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) before (group 1) and after (group 2) January 25, 2020 which was the date when Hong Kong hospitals launched emergency response measures to combat COVID-19. RESULTS: There was a reduction in daily emergency room attendance since January 25, 2020 (group 1,327/day vs. group 2,231/day) and 149 patients with diagnosis of MI were included into analysis (group 1 N = 85 vs. group 2 N = 64). For STEMI, patients in group 2 tended to have longer symptom-to-first medical contact time and more presented out of revascularization window (group 1 27.8 vs. group 2 33%). The primary composite outcome of in-hospital death, cardiogenic shock, sustained ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VT/VF) and use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) was significantly worse in group 2 (14.1 vs. 29.7%, p = .02). CONCLUSIONS: More MI patients during COVID-19 outbreak had complicated in-hospital course and worse outcomes. Besides direct infectious complications, cardiology community has to acknowledge the indirect effect of communicable disease on our patients and system of care.","Tam, Chor-Cheung Frankie; Cheung, Kent-Shek; Lam, Simon; Wong, Anthony; Yung, Arthur; Sze, Michael; Fang, Jonathan; Tse, Hung-Fat; Siu, Chung-Wah",Catheter. cardiovasc. interv,,359

To provide reference for the training of emergency surgical nurses during the outbreak of COVID-19. Design: Guided by Kirkpatrick's model, 35 nurses in the emergency surgery department were trained according to a program that resulted from the clinical demand during the pandemic. The trainees were observed in terms of their performance at reaction level and learning level. Results: At reaction level, the degree of satisfaction scored by nurses was relatively high, with its total score achieving (18.77 ± 3.09). At learning level, the differences between theoretical and operational scores of tested nurses before and after training proved to be statistically significant (p < 0.001). Conclusion: The application of Kirkpatrick's model based on clinical demand during the COVID-19 confirms to be effective for the training program of nurses in the emergency surgery department. It is also beneficial to improve nurses' knowledge and skills during the pandemic, which serves as a positive influence for clinical reference.","Li, Zheying; Cheng, Jing; Zhou, Ting; Wang, Sa; Huang, Sufang; Wang, Hui",Telemed. j. e. health,,359
320872,Measurement of oxidized albumin: An opportunity for diagnoses or treatment of COVID-19,2020,"Today, the world is facing the challenge of a major pandemic due to COVID-19, which has caused more than 6.1 million cases of infection and nearly 370,000 deaths so far. Most of the deaths from the disease are clustered in the older population, but the young and children are not spared. In this context, there is a critical need to revisit the formula for calculating potential years of life lost (PYLL). Data on age-specific deaths due to COVID-19 in three countries, including the United States (US), Italy, and Germany, were evaluated. New York State, as a significant outlier within the US, was also included. PYLLs in the US were five times as high as those of Italy. Compared with Germany, PYLLs in Italy were 4 times higher, and the rates in the US were 23, 25, and 18 times higher when using upper age limits of 70, 75, and 80, respectively. Standardized PYLLs in New York were 2 times as high as the rates in Italy, and 7 to 9 times as high as PYLLs in Germany. The revised formula of PYLL, using an upper limit of age 80, is recommended to accurately measure premature deaths due to a major disastrous disease such as COVID-19.","Mitra, Amal K; Payton, Marinelle; Kabir, Nusrat; Whitehead, April; Ragland, Kimberly N; Brown, Alexis",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,359

The numerical model takes into account the drug diffusion through the therapeutic lens along with heat transfer and aqueous humor flow in different orientations of the human eye (supine (two-dimensional) as well as standing (three-dimensional)). Results illustrate that the drug diffuses through the therapeutic lens to the cornea and is convected into the anterior chamber of the eye due to the temperature gradient across the eye. In addition, eye orientation significantly affects drug delivery with supine orientation providing better and uniform drug exposure in different target regions of the eye as compared to standing in the case of the therapeutic lens. Furthermore, a comparison of the therapeutic efficacy of the therapeutic lens has been done with topical administration and the drug uptake results from both the drug delivery modes have been validated with the experimental data reported in the literature. The developed model may help ophthalmologists to comprehend the transport and retention of different drugs in different domains and orientations of the human eye when administered through a therapeutic lens.","Bhandari, Ajay; Bansal, Ankit; Sinha, Niraj",Proc Inst Mech Eng H,,359

Herein, we report an eco-friendly and efficient electrochemical strategy for inactivating the SARS-CoV-2 using in-situ formed nickel oxide hydroxide as anode catalyst and sodium carbonate as electrolyte. At a voltage of 5 V, the SARS-CoV-2 viruses can be rapidly inactivated with disinfection efficiency reaching 95% in only 30 s and 99.99% in 5 min. Mass spectrometry analysis and theoretical calculations indicate that the reactive oxygen species generated on the anode can oxidize the peptide chains and induce cleavage of the peptide backbone of the receptor binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, and thereby disables the virus. This strategy provides a sustainable and highly efficient approach for the disinfection of the SARS-CoV-2 viruliferous aerosols and wastewater.","Tu, Yunchuan; Tang, Wei; Yu, Liang; Liu, Zheyi; Liu, Yanting; Xia, Huicong; Zhang, Haiwei; Chen, Shiyun; Wu, Jia; Cui, Xiaoju; Zhang, Jianan; Wang, Fangjun; Hu, Yangbo; Deng, Dehui",,,359

322596,Impact of Routine Infant BCG Vaccination on COVID-19,2020,"Abstract Background Chest radiography (CXR) and computerized tomography (CT) are the standard methods for lung imaging in diagnosing COVID-19 pneumonia in the intensive care unit (ICU), despite their limitations. This study aimed to assess the performance of bedside lung ultrasound examination by a critical care physician for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia during acute admission to the ICU. Method This was an observational, prospective, single-center study conducted in the intensive care unit of Adan General Hospital from April 10, 2020, to May 26, 2020. The study included adults with suspicion of COVID-19 Infection who were transferred to the ICU. Patients were admitted to the ICU directly from the ED after reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) swabs were sent to the central virology laboratory in Kuwait, and the results were released 16 to 24?hours after the time of admission. A certified intensivist in critical care ultrasound performed the lung ultrasound within 12?hours of the patient's admission to the ICU. The treating physician confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia based on a set of clinical features, inflammatory markers, biochemical profile studies, RT-PCR test results, and CXR. Results Of 77 patients with suspected COVID-19 pneumonia, 65 (84.4%) were confirmed. The median age of the patients was 48 (31-68) years, and 51 (71%) were men. In the group of patients with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia, LUS revealed four signs suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia in 63 patients (96.9%) (sensitivity 96.9%, CI 85%-99.5%). Two patients presented with unilateral lobar pneumonia without other ultrasonic signs of COVID-19 pneumonia but with positive RT-PCR results. Among patients in the group without COVID-19 pneumonia who had negative RT-PCR results, 11 (91.7%) were LUS negative for COVID-19 pneumonia (specificity 91.7%, 95% CI 58.72%-99.77%). Conclusions During the COVID-19 outbreak, LUS allows the identification of early signs of interstitial pneumonia. LUS patterns that show a combination of the four major signs offer high sensitivity and specificity compared to nasopharyngeal RT-PCR.","Bitar, Zouheir Ibrahim Shamsah Mohammed Maadarani Ossama Sajeh Bamasood Omar Mohammed Al-foudari Huda",Health Science Reports,,359

324116,An Integrated Model to Accelerate Patient Satisfaction Improvement,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic. Although much has been learned about the novel coronavirus since its emergence, there are many open questions related to tracking its spread, describing symptomology, predicting the severity of infection, and forecasting healthcare utilization. Free-text clinical notes contain critical information for resolving these questions. Data-driven, automatic information extraction models are needed to use this text-encoded information in large-scale studies. This work presents a new clinical corpus, referred to as the COVID-19 Annotated Clinical Text (CACT) Corpus, which comprises 1,472 notes with detailed annotations characterizing COVID-19 diagnoses, testing, and clinical presentation. We introduce a span-based event extraction model that jointly extracts all annotated phenomena, achieving high performance in identifying COVID-19 and symptom events with associated assertion values (0.83-0.97 F1 for events and 0.73-0.79 F1 for assertions). Our span-based event extraction model outperforms an extractor built on MetaMapLite for the identification of symptoms with assertion values. In a secondary use application, we predicted COVID-19 test results using structured patient data (e.g. vital signs and laboratory results) and automatically extracted symptom information, to explore the clinical presentation of COVID-19. Automatically extracted symptoms improve COVID-19 prediction performance, beyond structured data alone.","Lybarger, Kevin; Ostendorf, Mari; Thompson, Matthew; Yetisgen, Meliha",J Biomed Inform,,359

AIMS: To report the clinical characteristics, including gastrointestinal symptoms, of COVID-19 in IBD patients, and to assess the risk of COVID-19 in IBD. METHODS: This case series included consecutive IBD patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Age-adjusted cumulative incidences were compared with the general population in the Madrid region. RESULTS: Through April 8, 12 of 1918 IBD patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. The average age was 52 years, 75% of the patients were female and 58.3% had Crohn's disease. Seven patients (58%) were on maintenance treatment with immunomodulators/biologics, of these four with combined therapy (33%). Eight patients (66%) required hospitalisation (one intensive care unit admission, and two deaths), and four patients were isolated at home. Nine patients had diarrhoea ranging between 4 and 10 loose stools per day (mean 5.4, SD 1.6). In five patients (42%) diarrhoea was a presenting symptom. In two patients, diarrhoea was the only symptom at debut. Cumulative incidence of COVID-19 was 6.2 per 1000 IBD patients. IBD patients had a lower adjusted incidence ratio of COVID-19 (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.70-0.77; P < 0.001), and a similar associated mortality ratio (OR 0.95, 95% CI: 0.84-1.06; P = 0.36), compared with the general population. CONCLUSIONS: IBD patients do not have an increased risk of COVID-19 and associated mortality compared with the general population.

The recent elucidation of the experimental structure of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp enzyme complexed with triphosphate form of Remdesivir (RTP) has opened an avenue for structure-based identification of potent inhibitors. Given the high mortality rate of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and lack of effective therapeutics against it, an alternative for safe and speedy drug discovery needs to be sought after. One promising strategy could be to explore the possibility for repurposing the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved antiviral drugs and antiviral phytocompounds. In the present study, a set of FDA approved antiviral drugs and antiviral phytocompounds were screened for their ability to bind within the RdRp enzyme active pocket. The top 3 hits among the FDA approved drugs were Paritaprevir (D33), Rilpivirine (D19) and Simeprevir (D31) which scored binding energies between -8.08 kcal/mol and -10.46 kcal/mol. Emetine (P5), 7,4-di-O-galloyltricetifavan (P28) and Oleanolic acid (P17) were the top three phytocompounds hits and exhibited binding energies ranging from -7.81 kcal/mol to -8.17 kcal/mol. These drugs and phytocompounds were able to establish hydrogen bonds with the catalytic residues-Asp760 and Asp761 and hydrophobic interactions with neighbouring residues. Further, the physicochemical properties of the molecules were evaluated. These identified potential inhibitors warrant further experimental investigations before their acceptance as drug candidates for the treatment of the disease.","Bahadur Gurung, Arun; Ajmal Ali, Mohammad; Lee, Joongku; Abul Farah, Mohammad; Mashay Al-Anazi, Khalid",,,359

The vulnerability index was developed in five steps as follows: (1) determining the principles and components of employees' susceptibility and resilience, (2) weighting the principles and components, (3) converting the levels of components to the sub-index values, (4) introducing the aggregation functions, and (5) characterizing the vulnerability index values in five categories as very high (80-100), high (65-79), medium (50-64), low (30-49), and very low (0-29). The average values of susceptibility, resilience, and vulnerability index of the employees were determined to be 35.2 ± 15.0, 73.9 ± 17.0, and 32.9 ± 12.7, respectively. The average resilience of the employees was more desirable than their average susceptibility. The distribution of the employees into the vulnerability index categories was 46.3% for very low, 41.9% for low, 3.6% for medium, and 8.2% for high. The worst cases of susceptibility and resilience principles were exposure to contaminated surfaces (59.1 ± 22.8) and top management commitment (66.6 ± 23.1). The elderly staff (especially over 50 years old), employees with low education levels, and employees in private and self-employment sectors were significantly more vulnerable (p value < 0.01) from the COVID-19 pandemic. The principles with significant incremental effects on the vulnerability index (p value < 0.05) were respectively top management commitment (+1.78), exposure to COVID-19 patients at work (+1.36), exposure to contaminated surfaces (+0.82), installing clear shields and wearing PPE (+0.59), observance of social distancing (+0.48), and just culture (+0.22).

The stochastic dynamics of the protein is diffusive in denature phase at low c, it slows down on increasing c and stops moving beyond a threshold (cth = 0.10). In native phase, the protein moves extremely slow at low c but speeds up on further increasing c in a characteristic range (c = 0.10 - 0.20) before getting trapped at high c (cth = 0.30). The radius of gyration (Rg) of CoVE shows different non-monotonic dependence on c (increase followed by decay) in native and denature phase with a higher and sharper rate of change in farmer. Effective dimension (D) of CoVE is estimated from the scaling of structure factor: in denatured phase, D = 2 (a random coil conformation) at low c (= 0.01 - 0.10) with appearance of some globularization i.e. D ? 2.3, 2.5 at higher c (= 0.2, 0.3). Increasing c seems to reduce the globularity (D = 3) of CoVE in native phase.","Pandey, R. B.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07912v1.pdf,359

The purpose of this study was to examine the creativity and strategies of physical education teachers in improving the quality of student learning outcomes to maintain the continuity of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. Researchers used a descriptive qualitative approach with research subjects, namely Physical Education teachers and students of Wonosobo Public Senior High School 1. The data collection techniques used were in-depth interviews and documentation. The results showed that the form of physical education teacher strategies in improving the quality of online learning during the COVID-19 outbreak was by using the method of publishing the work of students. This method is proven effective and can increase students’ interest, motivation to learn, stimulate student discipline, and can make it easier for teachers to make assessments.

This disease is caused by an RNA virus, Severe Acquired Respiratory Syndrome -Corona Virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). This class of viruses have a high rate of mutation than DNA viruses that enables them to adapt and also evade host immune system. Here, we compared the first known Nucleocapsid Phosphoprotein (N protein) sequence of SARS-CoV-2 from China with the sequences from Indian COVID-19 patients to understand, if this virus is also mutating, as it is spreading to new locations. Our data revealed twenty mutations present among Indian isolates. Out of these, mutation at six positions led to changes in the secondary structure of N protein. Further, we also show that these mutations are primarily destabilising the protein structure. The candidate mutations identified in this study may help to speed up the understanding of variations occurring in SARS-CoV-2.","Azad, G. K.",Heliyon,,359

At the first step, we embed the time series into a reduced low-dimensional space using a nonlinear manifold learning algorithm such as Locally Linear Embedding and Diffusion Maps. At the second step, we construct reduced-order regression models on the manifold, in particular Multivariate Autoregressive (MVAR) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models, to forecast the embedded dynamics. At the final step, we lift the embedded time series back to the original high-dimensional space using Radial Basis Functions interpolation and Geometric Harmonics. For our illustrations, we test the forecasting performance of the proposed numerical scheme with four sets of time series: three synthetic stochastic ones resembling EEG signals produced from linear and nonlinear stochastic models with different model orders, and one real-world data set containing daily time series of 10 key foreign exchange rates (FOREX) spanning the time period 03/09/2001-29/10/2020. The forecasting performance of the proposed numerical scheme is assessed using the combinations of manifold learning, modelling and lifting approaches.

However, immunoassays do not provide information about contaminating antigens or cross-reactions and might exhibit inaccurately high sensitivity and low specificity. We aimed to gain insight into the serological immune response of SARS-CoV-2 patients by immunoblot analysis. We analyzed serum immunoglobulins IgM, -A, and -G directed against SARS-CoV-2 proteins by immunoblot analysis from 12 infected patients. We determined IgG isotype antibodies by commercially available ELISA and assessed the clinical parameters of inflammation status and kidney and liver injury. Unexpectedly, we found no correlation between the presence of antibodies and the future course of the disease. However, attention should be paid to the parameters CRP, IL-6, and LDH. We found evidence of antibody cross-reactivity, which questions the reliability of results for serum samples that tested negative for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies when assessed by immunoassays. Nevertheless, for the detection of IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, our data suggest that the use of the spike glycoprotein in immunoassays should be sufficient to identify positive patients. Using a combination of the spike glycoprotein and the open reading frame 8 protein could prove to be the best way of detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM antibodies.","Meinberger, Denise; Koch, Manuel; Roth, Annika; Hermes, Gabriele; Stemler, Jannik; Cornely, Oliver A; Streichert, Thomas; Klatt, Andreas R",Sci Rep,,359

329762,Discordance Between Clinical Status and Chest X-Ray (CXR) in COVID-19 Patient with Asymptomatic Transmission in Jakarta,2020,"BACKGROUND: Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is an arthropod-borne virus mainly transmitted in tropical areas by Aedes spp. mosquitoes. It has been responsible for small-to-large outbreaks in temperate areas including southern Europe and North America. Past outbreaks in 2006 on the islands of Maldives, as well as on other islands in the Indian Ocean and in Southeast Asia, demonstrated for the first time the capacity of CHIKV to disseminate through travel and transcontinental commerce, and revealed the major socio-economic impact of CHIKV epidemics. Recently, CHIKV has been circulating in highly touristic areas including the Maldives, where 1736 cases were notified by the Health Protection Agency during 2019. CASE SERIES: Among EuroTravNet/GeoSentinel patient records, eight CHIKV-confirmed cases imported the Maldives to France, Germany, Denmark, Italy and Spain were identified between February 2019 and February 2020; exceeding the total number of CHIKV infections travel-acquired in Maldives reported to this surveillance network during the previous 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: The prevention and control of CHIKV introduction into naïve areas colonised by competent vectors is crucial. CHIKV outbreaks must be detected and reported in a timely manner. This must lead to adapted health information for international travellers and to prompt management of suspected imported cases. Conversely, travellers make for excellent sentinels and increased reports of imported cases might reflect a change in the level of endemicity or even herald an outbreak. Feedback to the local health authorities and matching this with local epidemiological surveillance data may lead to health benefits for the local population.","Dudouet, Pierre; Gautret, Philippe; Larsen, Carsten Schade; Díaz-Menéndez, Marta; Trigo, Elena; von Sonnenburg, Frank; Gobbi, Federico; Grobusch, Martin P; Malvy, Denis; Field, Vanessa; Asgeirsson, Hilmir; Souto, Inés Oliveira; Hamer, Davidson H; Parola, Philippe; Javelle, Emilie",Travel Med Infect Dis,,359

School closures occurred on March 16, 2020, in 10 out of 32 Mexican states, and one week later in the remaining states. Because the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the influenza virus have similar transmission mechanisms, we aimed to evaluate the impact of physical distancing on the incidence of influenza as a proxy of the impact on SARS-CoV-2 contagion. METHODOLOGY: A national flu surveillance system was cross-sectionally analyzed and daily average percent changes (APCs) of incidence rates were calculated throught Poisson regression models. RESULTS: Greater decreasing trends (APCs -8.8, 95% CI: -12.5, -4.5; vs. -6.0, 95% CI: -9.9, -2.0; p = 0.026) were documented in the states with earlier school closures and across age groups, suggesting that earlier implementation of physical distance results in reduced SARS-CoV-2 spread. CONCLUSIONS: Physical distancing policies decrease the incidence of influenza infections in Mexico; its favorable impact on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is commendable.","Murillo-Zamora, Efrén; Guzmán-Esquivel, José; Sánchez-Piña, Ramón Alberto; Cedeño-Laurent, Guillermo; Delgado-Enciso, Iván; Mendoza-Cano, Oliver",J Infect Dev Ctries,,359

As such, proper symptom identification, including gastrointestinal manifestations, and relationship to health outcomes remains key. We aimed to assess the prevalence and impact of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with COVID-19 in a large quaternary referral center in South America. METHODS: This was a single-center cohort study in a COVID-19 specific hospital in São Paulo, Brazil. Consecutive adult patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 were included. Baseline patient history, presenting symptoms, laboratory results, and clinically relevant outcomes were recorded. Regression analyses were performed to determine significant predictors of the gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 and hospitalization outcomes. RESULTS: Four-hundred patients with COVID-19 were included. Of these, 33.25% of patients reported &#8805;1 gastrointestinal symptom. Diarrhea was the most common gastrointestinal symptom (17.25%). Patients with gastrointestinal symptoms had higher rates of concomitant constitutional symptoms, notably fatigue and myalgia (p<0.05). Gastrointestinal symptoms were also more prevalent among patients on chronic immunosuppressants, ACE/ARB medications, and patient with chronic kidney disease (p<0.05). Laboratory results, length of hospitalization, ICU admission, ICU length of stay, need for mechanical ventilation, vasopressor support, and in-hospital mortality did not differ based upon gastrointestinal symptoms (p>0.05). Regression analyses showed older age [OR 1.04 (95% CI, 1.02-1.06)], male gender [OR 1.94 (95% CI, 1.12-3.36)], and immunosuppression [OR 2.60 (95% CI, 1.20-5.63)], were associated with increased mortality. CONCLUSION: Based upon this Brazilian study, gastrointestinal manifestations of COVID-19 are common but do not appear to impact clinically relevant hospitalization outcomes including the need for ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, or mortality.","Moura, Diogo Turiani Hourneaux de; Proença, Igor Mendonça; McCarty, Thomas R; Sagae, Vitor Massaro Takamatsu; Ribeiro, Igor Braga; Oliveira, Guilherme Henrique Peixoto de; Souza, Gabriel Mayo Vieira de; Hirsch, Bruno Salomão; Scatimburgo, Maria Vitória Cury Vieira; Thompson, Christopher C; Carrilho, Flair José; Cecconello, Ivan; Moura, Eduardo Guimarães Hourneaux de",Clinics (Sao Paulo),,359
332103,Immune suppression in the early stage of COVID-19 disease,2020,"BACKGROUND: TSST-1 is a secretory and pyrogenic superantigen that is being responsible for staphylococcal mediated food poisoning and associated clinical manifestations. It is one of the main targets for the construction of vaccine candidates against Staphylococcus aureus. Most of the vaccines have met failure due to adverse reactions and toxicity reported during late clinical studies. To overcome this, an immunoinformatics approach is being used in the present study for the design of a multi-epitope vaccine to circumvent the problems related to toxicity and allergenicity. RESULTS: In this study, a multi-epitope vaccine against Staphylococcus aureus targeting TSST-1 was designed through an immunoinformatics approach. B cell and T cell epitopes were predicted in silico and mapped with linkers to avoid junctional immunogenicity and to ensure the efficient presentation of exposed epitopes through HLA. ß-defensin and PADRE were adjusted at the N-terminal end of the final vaccine as adjuvants. Physiochemical parameters, antigenicity, and allergenicity of the vaccine construct were determined with the help of online servers. The three-dimensional structure of the vaccine protein was predicted and validated with various tools. The affinity of the vaccine with TLR-3 was studied through molecular docking studies and the interactions of two proteins were visualized using LigPlot+. The vaccine was successfully cloned in silico into pET-28a (+) for efficient expression in E. coli K12 system. Population coverage analysis had shown that the vaccine construct can cover 83.15% of the global population. Immune simulation studies showed an increase in the antibody levels, IL-2, IFN-Î³, TGF-ß, B cell, and T cell populations and induced primary, secondary, and tertiary immune responses. CONCLUSION: Multi-epitope vaccine designed through a computational approach is a non-allergic and non-toxic antigen.

Food security in Sarawak was affected by the implementation of the Movement Control Order (MCO) that was introduced to curb the spread of the Covid-19 disease. The MCO, and the subsequent phases that followed, imposed a varying degree of restrictions on movements in the country. This measure had serious repercussions on food security as it affects the distribution of food as well as how people access food. This raises questions of how secure households are in terms of food security, how do they ensure food security for their households and what are their greatest challenge in ensuring food security. This paper seeks to address those questions by examining the experiences and perceptions on food security during the pandemic based on the responses of 235 respondents. Findings indicated that most households are food secure i.e. having similar access to food as prior to MCO and have not skipped any meals. In order to achieve this, households had to resort to various measures including switching their food sources, shopping online, and going without their preferred food. Significantly, the finding shows that food security means more than just having enough food but should also incorporate elements of variety, types and quantity of food. It also shows that the greatest challenge in achieving and maintaining household food security lies in the way household cope with the changes brought, both directly and indirectly, by the pandemic. © 2021, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak.

333064,The inadequate reporting of sex in research,2020,"INTRODUCTION: We aimed to give a global overview of trends in access to sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and what is being done to mitigate its impact. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a descriptive analysis and content analysis based on an online survey among clinicians, researchers, and organizations. Our data were extracted from multiple-choice questions on access to SRHR services and risk of SRHR violations, and written responses to open-ended questions on threats to access and required response. RESULTS: The survey was answered by 51 people representing 29 countries. Eighty-six percent reported that access to contraceptive services was less or much less because of COVID-19, corresponding figures for surgical and medical abortion were 62% and 46%. The increased risk of gender-based and sexual violence was assessed as moderate or severe by 79%. Among countries with mildly restrictive abortion policies, 69% had implemented changes to facilitate access to abortion during the pandemic, compared with none among countries with severe restrictions (P < .001), 87.5% compared with 46% had implemented changes to facilitate access to contraception (P = .023). The content analysis showed that (a) prioritizations in health service delivery at the expense of SRHR, (b) lack of political will, (c) the detrimental effect of lockdown, and (d) the suspension of sexual education, were threats to SRHR access (theme 1). Requirements to mitigate these threats (theme 2) were (a) political will and support of universal access to SRH services, (b) the sensitization of providers, (c) free public transport, and (d) physical protective equipment. A contrasting third theme was the state of exception of the COVID-19 pandemic as a window of opportunity to push forward women's health and rights. CONCLUSIONS: Many countries have seen decreased access to and increased violations of SRHR during the COVID-19 pandemic. Countries with severe restrictions on abortion seem less likely to have implemented changes to SRHR delivery to mitigate this impact. Political will to support the advancement of SRHR is often lacking, which is fundamental to ensuring both continued access and, in a minority of cases, the solidification of gains made to SRHR during the pandemic.","Endler, Margit; Al-Haidari, Taghreed; Benedetto, Chiara; Chowdhury, Sameena; Christilaw, Jan; El Kak, Faysal; Galimberti, Diana; Garcia-Moreno, Claudia; Gutierrez, Miguel; Ibrahim, Shaimaa; Kumari, Shantha; McNicholas, Colleen; Mostajo Flores, Desirée; Muganda, John; Ramirez-Negrin, Atziri; Senanayake, Hemantha; Sohail, Rubina; Temmerman, Marleen; Gemzell-Danielsson, Kristina",Acta obstet. gynecol. scand,,359

333234,COVID-19 - Treatment Approaches from a palliative medical Perspective,2020,"COVID-19 also known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona virus-2 is a contagious disease that is released from tiny droplets containing saliva or mucus from respiratory system of a diseased person who talks, sneeze, or cough. It spreads rapidly through close contact with somebody who is infected or tapping or holding a virus contaminated objects and surfaces. Another infectious illness known as Pneumonia is often caused by infection due to a bacterium in the alveoli of lungs. When an infected tissue of the lungs has inflammation, it builds-up pus in it. To find out if the patient has these diseases, experts conduct physical exams and diagnose their patients through Chest X-ray, ultrasound, or biopsy of lungs. Misdiagnosis, inaccurate treatment, and if the disease is ignored will lead to the patient's loss of life. The progression of Deep Learning contributes to aid in the decisionmaking process of experts to diagnose patients with these diseases. The study employs a flexible and efficient approach of deep learning applying the model of CNN in predicting and detecting a patient unaffected and affected with the disease employing a chest X-ray image. The study utilized a collected dataset of 20,000 images using a 224x224 image resolution with 32 batch size is applied to prove the performance of the CNN model being trained. The trained-model produced an accuracy rate of 95% during the performance training. Based on the result of testing conducted, the research study can detect and predict COVID-19, bacterial, and viral-pneumonia diseases based on chest X-ray images.","Militante, S. V.; Dionisio, N.

333700,The use of imaging in COVID-19-results of a global survey by the International Society of Radiology,2020,"Orthodontic science has progressed tremendously in the last two decades, from traditional stainless wires and brackets to sophisticated contemporary materials, types of brackets and bonding agents, anchorage devices and the use of nanotechnology. The development has extended to all domains of diagnosis, treatment planning, treatment alternatives, storage of data, patient education and marketing. This chapter comprehensively lists all spheres of advancements, highlighting the advantages and limitations of each of the enumerated processes. Digitization in orthodontics has completely revolutionized diagnosis, employing three-dimensional (3D) analysis by intraoral scans, 3D-Cone Beam Computed Tomography (3D-CBCT) radiographs and stereophotogrammetry, for greater accuracy and possibility of virtual setting. In addition, aligner technology has also seen a boom using this virtual data for computer aided design(CAD) and creation of appliances by 3D printing. Varied softwares have found their way into orthodontic office for analysis, superimpositions and predictions, thus allowing the patients to make informed decisions. Few softwares also allow remote patient monitoring, tele-orthodontics, patient education and reminder applications. Social media has become a powerful tool for product awareness, discussions with patients, orthodontic teaching, though the accuracy of information is questionable. Acceleration of orthodontic treatment has been targeted with various surgical (micro-osteoperforation, corticotomy, Wilckodontics etc.), non-surgical (vibration, lasers etc.) and biological (prostaglandins etc.) agents. This chapter also touches upon upcoming areas like machine learning, artificial intelligence and big data in orthodontics which can aid in evidence-based practice from large clinical repositories in cost effective ways. Current COVID-19 times brings forth the importance of virtual patient data and minimal patient contact, thus emphasizing the role of modified orthodontic triage, a significant mention of which has been made in the current chapter. © 2021 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Kapoor, P.; Aziz, S.

333995,The Social Brain and Emotional Contagion: COVID-19 Effects,2020,"Background: The effective treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains unclear. We reported successful use of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in cases of severe COVID-19, but evidence from larger case series is still lacking. Methods: A multi-center retrospective study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of IVIg administered within two weeks of disease onset at a total dose of 2 g/kg body weight, in addition to standard care. The primary endpoint was 28-day mortality. Efficacy of high-dose IVIg was assessed by using the Cox proportional hazards regression model and the Kaplan-Meier curve adjusted by inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) analysis, and IPTW after multiple imputation (MI) analysis. Results: Overall, 26 patients who received high-dose IVIg with standard therapy and 89 patients who received standard therapy only were enrolled in this study. The IVIg group was associated with a lower 28-day mortality rate and less time to normalization of inflammatory markers including IL-6, IL-10, and ferritin compared with the control. The adjusted HR of 28-day mortality in high-dose IVIg group was 0.24 (95% CI 0.06-0.99, p<0.001) in IPTW model, and 0.27 (95% CI 0.10-0.57, p=0.031) in IPTW-MI model. In subgroup analysis, patients with no comorbidities or treated in the first week of disease were associated with more benefit from high-dose IVIg. Conclusions: High-dose IVIg administered in severe COVID-19 patients within 14 days of onset was linked to reduced 28-day mortality, more prominent with those having no comorbidities or treated at earlier stage.","Cao, Wei; Liu, Xiaosheng; Hong, Ke; Ma, Zhiyong; Zhang, Yuelun; Lin, Ling; Han, Yang; Xiong, Yong; Liu, Zhengyin; Ruan, Lianguo; Li, Taisheng",Front Immunol,,359
334006,An Overview of the Ongoing Clinical Issues of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: A country's health system faces pressure when hit by an unexpected shock, such as what we observe in the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The concept of resilience is highly relevant in this context and is a prerequisite for a health system capable of withstanding future shocks. By exploring how the key dimensions of the resilient health system framework are applied, the present systematic review synthesizes the vital features of resilient health systems in low- and middle-income countries. The aim of this review is to ascertain the relevance of health system resilience in the context of a major shock, through better understanding its dimensions, uses and implications. METHODS: The review uses the best-fit framework synthesis approach. An a priori conceptual framework was selected and a coding framework created. A systematic search identified 4284 unique citations from electronic databases and reports by non-governmental organisations, 12 of which met the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted and coded against the pre-existing themes. Themes outside of the a priori framework were collated to form a refined list of themes. Then, all twelve studies were revisited using the new list of themes in the context of each study. RESULTS: Ten themes were generated from the analysis. Five confirmed the a priori conceptual framework that capture the dynamic attributes of a resilient system. Five new themes were identified as foundational for achieving resilience: realigned relationships, foresight and motivation as drivers, and emergency preparedness and change management as organisational mechanisms. CONCLUSION: The refined conceptual model shows how the themes inter-connect. The foundations of resilience appear to be critical especially in resource-constrained settings to unlock the dynamic attributes of resilience. This review prompts countries to consider building the foundations of resilience described here as a priority to better prepare for future shocks.","Grimm, Pauline Yongeun; Oliver, Sandy; Merten, Sonja; Han, Wai Wai; Wyss, Kaspar",Int. j. health policy manag,,359

Though current diagnostic methods including real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) provide sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2, they require relatively long processing time, equipped laboratory facilities, and highly skilled personnel. Laser-scribed graphene (LSG)-based biosensing platforms have gained enormous attention as miniaturized electrochemical systems, holding an enormous potential as point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tools. We describe here a miniaturized LSG-based electrochemical sensing scheme for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis combined with three-dimensional (3D) gold nanostructures. This electrode was modified with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody following the proper surface modifications proved by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) characterizations as well as electrochemical techniques. The system was integrated into a handheld POC detection system operated using a custom smartphone application, providing a user-friendly diagnostic platform due to its ease of operation, accessibility, and systematic data management. The analytical features of the electrochemical immunoassay were evaluated using the standard solution of S-protein in the range of 5.0-500 ng/mL with a detection limit of 2.9 ng/mL. A clinical study was carried out on 23 patient blood serum samples with successful COVID-19 diagnosis, compared to the commercial RT-PCR, antibody blood test, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) IgG and IgA test results. Our test provides faster results compared to commercial diagnostic tools and offers a promising alternative solution for next-generation POC applications.","Beduk, Tutku; Beduk, Duygu; de Oliveira Filho, José Ilton; Zihnioglu, Figen; Cicek, Candan; Sertoz, Ruchan; Arda, Bilgin; Goksel, Tuncay; Turhan, Kutsal; Salama, Khaled N; Timur, Suna",Anal Chem,,359

We conducted an ecological momentary assessment study in which female undergraduate students (N = 146) completed a brief online survey at five random times every day for five days. In this survey, participants were asked if they had made an appearance comparison. If so, they were asked who they compared themselves to (i.e., close peer, acquaintance, stranger, celebrity/model), how they rated compared to that person (i.e., more attractive, just as attractive, less attractive), and how attainable that person's appearance is to them. All participants then completed state measures of mood, appearance satisfaction, and intention to diet and exercise. Upward comparisons (i.e., to more attractive others) to all targets were associated with less appearance satisfaction, lower positive mood, and more thoughts of dieting and exercising than when no comparisons were made. There were indirect relationships between comparisons to celebrities/models versus all other targets and appearance satisfaction via perceived attainability of the target's appearance. These findings suggest that celebrities may be particularly harmful appearance comparison targets in women's everyday lives because their attractive appearance is perceived to be less personally attainable than other targets.","Fardouly, Jasmine; Pinkus, Rebecca T; Vartanian, Lenny R",Body Image,,359

336468,Vitamin K metabolism as the potential missing link between lung damage and thromboembolism in Covid-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Head of bed (HOB) elevation to 30° after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) has become standard positioning across all age groups. This maneuver is thought to minimize the risk of elevated ICP in the hopes of decreasing cerebral blood and fluid volume and increasing cerebral venous outflow with improvement in jugular venous drainage. However, HOB elevation is based on adult population data due to a current paucity of pediatric TBI studies regarding HOB management. In this prospective study of pediatric patients with severe TBI, the authors investigated the role of different head positions on intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and cerebral venous outflow through the internal jugular veins (IJVs) on postinjury days 2 and 3 because these time periods are considered the peak risk for intracranial hypertension. METHODS: Patients younger than 18 years with a Glasgow Coma Scale score &#8804; 8 after severe TBI were prospectively recruited at a single quaternary pediatric intensive care unit. All patients had an ICP monitor placed, and no other neurosurgical procedure was performed. On the 2nd and 3rd days postinjury, the degree of HOB elevation was varied between 0° (head-flat or horizontal), 10°, 20°, 30°, 40°, and 50° while ICP, CPP, and bilateral IJV blood flows were recorded. RESULTS: Eighteen pediatric patients with severe TBI were analyzed. On each postinjury day, 13 of the 18 patients had at least 1 optimal HOB position (the position that simultaneously demonstrated the lowest ICP and the highest CPP). Six patients on each postinjury day had 30° as the optimal HOB position, with only 2 being the same patient on both postinjury days. On postinjury day 2, 3 patients had more than 1 optimal HOB position, while 5 patients did not have an optimal position. On postinjury day 3, 2 patients had more than 1 optimal HOB position while 5 patients did not have an optimal position. Interestingly, 0° (head-flat or horizontal) was the optimal HOB position in 2 patients on postinjury day 2 and 3 patients on postinjury day 3. The optimal HOB position demonstrated lower right IJV blood flow than a nonoptimal position on both postinjury days 2 (p = 0.0023) and 3 (p = 0.0033). There was no significant difference between optimal and nonoptimal HOB positions in the left IJV blood flow. CONCLUSIONS: In pediatric patients with severe TBI, the authors demonstrated that the optimal HOB position (which decreases ICP and improves CPP) is not always at 30°. Instead, the optimal HOB should be individualized for each pediatric TBI patient on a daily basis.","Lang, Shih-Shan; Valeri, Amber; Zhang, Bingqing; Storm, Phillip B; Heuer, Gregory G; Leavesley, Lauren; Bellah, Richard; Kim, Chong Tae; Griffis, Heather; Kilbaugh, Todd J; Huh, Jimmy W",J Neurosurg Pediatr,,359

Moreover, we have defined retinal ganglion cell (RGC)-specific identifiers to demonstrate the ability for ABI to reprogram induced RGCs (iRGCs) from fibroblasts. Unlike iSG neurons, iRGCs maintain a scattering distribution pattern characteristic of endogenous RGCs. iSG organoids may serve as a model to decipher the pathogenesis of sensorineural diseases and screen effective drugs and a source for cell replacement therapy.","Xiao, Dongchang; Deng, Qinqin; Guo, Yanan; Huang, Xiuting; Zou, Min; Zhong, Jiawei; Rao, Pinhong; Xu, Zihui; Liu, Yifan; Hu, Youjin; Shen, Yin; Jin, Kangxin; Xiang, Mengqing",Sci.

337803,COVID-19 in endoscopy: Time to do more?,2020,"Multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) represent a prominent and growing form of elder abuse intervention in communities across the U.S. and around the world. Despite the proliferation and promise of MDTs as a model of elder abuse intervention, the field lacks infrastructure, including a standardized data collection strategy, to facilitate a coordinated and informed MDT effort. This commentary presents an exploratory study, which sought to examine existing strategies of case-level electronic data collection implemented by MDTs across the U.S. Using a snowball sampling strategy, we identified 11 MDTs using an electronic data collection strategy. Our analysis found a tremendous range in both the extent and nature of data collection across MDTs, yet it identified common domains of data. A standardized MDT data collection strategy would benefit several MDT stakeholders, including coordinators tracking everyday operations, funders requiring reporting, and researchers conducting large-scale comparative research to identify best MDT practices.","Burnes, David; Kirchin, Darin; Elman, Alyssa; Breckman, Risa; Lachs, Mark S; Rosen, Tony",J Elder Abuse Negl,,359
337811,COVID-19 Attacks the Kidney: Ultrastructural Evidence for the Presence of Virus in the Glomerular Epithelium,2020,"Objective: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is very common in the elderly, so it is particularly important to find appropriate prevention or treatment. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of dexmedetomidine (DEX) on the degeneration of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and its mechanism. Methods: We established a mouse model of IVDD and cultured mouse NP cells and treated them with IL-1ß and DEX. The effect of DEX on NP cells was determined by detecting the extracellular matrix of NP cells, changes in ROS levels and inflammatory mediators. LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, is used to inhibit the activity of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. The effect of DEX on the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway was determined by studying the effects of DEX on PI3K/ Akt signaling pathway-related molecules and the effect of LY294002 on NP cells degeneration. DEX significantly increased the disc height index and attenuated IVDD in mice. Results: DEX significantly inhibited the expression of MMP3/9 in NP cells, effectively inhibiting the degradation of extracellular matrix. In addition, oxidative stress levels and inflammatory levels in NP cells are also attenuated by DEX. The expression of PI3K, Akt and p-Akt was significantly increased in DEX-stimulated NP cells, indicating that DEX increased the activity of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. DEX promotes PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, inhibits oxidative stress and inflammatory of NP cells, thereby slowing the degeneration of NP cells. Conclusion: DEX promotes PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, inhibits oxidative stress and inflammatory of NP cells, thereby slowing the degeneration of NP cells.","Qi, Shanhong; Li, Chao; Kong, Xiangdong; Zheng, Qiang",Pharmazie,,359

The current gold standard for growth of epithelial cells for research utilises growth arrested murine 3T3 J2 feeder layers, which are not available for use as a GMP compliant raw material. Using porcine mucosal tissue, we demonstrate a new method for obtaining and growing non-keratinised squamous epithelial cells and fibroblast cells from a single biopsy, replacing the 3T3 J2 with a growth arrested primary fibroblast feeder layer and using pooled Human Platelet lysate (HPL) as the media serum supplement to replace foetal bovine serum (FBS). The initial isolation of the cells was semi-automated using an Octodissociator and the resultant cell suspension cryopreservation for future use. When compared to the gold standard of 3T3 J2 and FBS containing medium there was no reduction in growth, viability, stem cell population or ability to differentiate to mature epithelial cells. Furthermore, this method was replicated with Human buccal tissue, providing cells of sufficient quality and number to create a tissue engineered sheet.","Tait, Angela; Proctor, Toby; Hamilton, Nick J I; Birchall, Martin A; Lowdell, Mark W",Sci Rep,,359
338293,Evidence-Based Medicine: What Neurologists Need to Remember During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Given the uncertainty of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, implementing telerehabilitation that enables the remote delivery of rehabilitation services is needed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. We studied the implementation and the effectiveness of the virtual Graded Repetitive Arm Supplementary Program (GRASP) delivered and evaluated via videoconferencing in individuals with stroke. METHODS: The Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework with mixed methods was used to evaluate the implementation of the 2 iterations of the program delivered by a nonprofit organization during the pandemic. RESULTS: Reach: Seventeen people were screened, 13 people were eligible, and 11 consented to participate in the study. Effectiveness: Between baseline and posttest, participants with stroke demonstrated significant improvement in upper extremity function (Arm Capacity and Movement Test) and self-perceived upper extremity (UE) function (Stroke Impact Scale). Adoption: Factors that facilitate program uptake by the staff were well-planned implementation, appropriate screening procedure, and helpful feedback from the audits. All staff felt comfortable using videoconferencing technology to deliver the program despite some technical difficulties. Factors contributing to ongoing participation included that the participants liked the group, they perceived improvements, and the instructor was encouraging. Only one participant with stroke was not comfortable using the videoconferencing technology. Implementation: The program was implemented as intended as evaluated by a fidelity checklist. Participants' adherence was high, as verified by the average attendance and practice time. Maintenance: The organization continued to offer the program. CONCLUSION: The virtual GRASP program was successfully implemented. Although the program was effective in improving both measured and perceived UE function in a small sample of individuals with stroke, caution should be taken in generalizing the results. IMPACT: Implementing telerehabilitation is crucial to optimize patient outcomes and reduce the spread of COVID-19. Our findings provide guidance on the process of delivering a UE rehabilitation program remotely via videoconferencing for stroke. Moreover, insights that arise from this study also inform the implementation of other telerehabilitation services.","Yang, Chieh-Ling; Waterson, Seonaid; Eng, Janice J",Phys. ther,,359

There are still limited studies related to the cases of COVID'19. Thus, this study's objective was to provide an overview of the characteristics of 4359 COVID'19 death cases in Central Java. Methods This research used a cross-sectional descriptive design with univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis involving secondary data acquired from a report by the Provincial Health Office of Central Java, recorded up to 13 December 2020. Results The results showed that the highest frequencies of death cases were contributed from >60 years group (n=1897 patients;43.52%) and the male (n=2497 patients;57.28%) group. The case fatality rate (CFR) rose with age, and the highest CFR was recorded in the elderly (17.95%), males (7.60%), in Pati District (17.45%), while entrepreneur (14.64%) was the highest reported job. Furthermore, the eldest group (>60 years) and males were more susceptible to die, with ORs 5.49 (95%CI: 5.15-5.86) and 1.61 (95%CI: 1.51-1.71), sequentially. The majority of death cases had comorbidities (65.79%), while the most prevalent reported comorbidities were diabetes (n=1387, 31.82%) and hypertension (n=817, 18.74%). Meanwhile, patients of old age were more likely to associate comorbidity, p<0.001, OR 1.664 (95%CI: 1.425-1.944). Conclusions This study concludes that patients of older age and males may become more vulnerable than younger and females to experience death. Further study is required to measure the relationship between other characteristics of demographics, underlying medical conditions, and fatality.","Sutiningsih, Dwi Azzahra Nur Azizah Prabowo Yulianto Sugiharto Aris Wibowo Mufti Agung Lestari Endah Sri Aurorina Estri",Germs,,359

These measures included the closure of schools and universities, the closure of borders and airports, cancellation of public and religious gatherings, and mandatory quarantine for persons returning from traveling abroad. Such measures have played a major role in the control of COVID-19 spread. However, due to social and economic pressures, the government relaxed the lockdown. After relaxing the measures, a sharp increase in the number of patients was noticed. Besides, there was a significant increase in the number of symptomatic patients and the case fatality rate was doubled. In addition, the outbreak and outbreak response led to the loss of trust and a breakdown in relations between the society and local authority. To minimize the consequences for population health, local authority should have a plan that balances between health imperatives and socioeconomic imperatives. Finally, to be successful in controlling the infection, the government must rebuild public trust in the handling of COVID-19 outbreak and compensate people for lost earnings.","Hussein, Nawfal R.; Naqid, Ibrahim A.; Saleem, Zana Sidiq M.; Almizori, Lokman A.; Musa, Dildar H.; Ibrahim, Nashwan",Ann.

341229,Impact of COVID-19 on Pediatric Gastroenterology Fellow Training in North America,2020,"We derive and validate a novel and analytic method for estimating the probability that an epidemic has been eliminated (i.e. that no future local cases will emerge) in real time. When this probability crosses 0.95 an outbreak can be declared over with 95% confidence. Our method is easy to compute, only requires knowledge of the incidence curve and the serial interval distribution, and evaluates the statistical lifetime of the outbreak of interest. Using this approach, we show how the time-varying under-reporting of infected cases will artificially inflate the inferred probability of elimination, leading to premature (false-positive) end-of-epidemic declarations. Contrastingly, we prove that incorrectly identifying imported cases as local will deceptively decrease this probability, resulting in delayed (false-negative) declarations. Failing to sustain intensive surveillance during the later phases of an epidemic can therefore substantially mislead policymakers on when it is safe to remove travel bans or relax quarantine and social distancing advisories. World Health Organisation guidelines recommend fixed (though disease-specific) waiting times for end-of-epidemic declarations that cannot accommodate these variations. Consequently, there is an unequivocal need for more active and specialised metrics for reliably identifying the conclusion of an epidemic.","Parag, Kris V; Donnelly, Christl A; Jha, Rahul; Thompson, Robin N",PLoS Comput Biol,,359

STUDY DESIGN: This is a statistical study, evaluating variables associated with COVID-19 mortality in the EU. METHODS: The association of these variables is analysed by means of multiple regression. Three groups of countries are distinguished according to the percentage of population over 65 years of age (terciles), to determine whether the variables affect the mortality rate according to the concentration of the adult population. RESULTS: In the first tercile, a higher number of physicians will contribute to lower mortality rates. In countries in the second tercile, the number of physicians is not relevant, but healthcare expenditure or the number of beds is. In the older age group, neither variable is significant.

Hospital stays after HF have shortened along time. We investigated the association between length of hospital stay after HF and mortality after discharge among persons with AD. METHODS: The MEDALZ cohort includes all Finnish community dwellers who received clinically verified AD diagnosis in 2005-2011 (n=70,718). Patients who experienced first HF after AD diagnosis in 2005â2015 (n=6999) were selected. Length of hospital stay for HF was measured as a sum of the consecutive days spent in hospital after HF until discharge. Outcome was defined as death within 30-days after hospital discharge. RESULTS: Mean of overall length of hospital stay after a HF decreased from 52.6 (SD 62.9) days in 2005 to 19.6 (SD 23.1) days in 2015. Shortest treatment decile (1â4 days) had the highest risk of death within 30 days after discharge (adjusted hazard ratio, aHR, 2.76; 95% confidence interval, CI, 1.66-4.60) in addition to second (5â6 days; aHR 2.52; 95% CI 1.50-4.23), and third (7â10 days; aHR 2.22; 95% CI 1.34-3.69) deciles when compared to the sixth decile of length of stays (21â26 days). CONCLUSIONS: Among persons with AD, shorter length of hospital stay after HF was associated with an increased risk of death after discharge. After acute hip fracture treatment, inpatient rehabilitation or proper care and services in home need to be organized to older persons with AD.","Lavikainen, Piia; Koponen, Marjaana; Taipale, Heidi; Tanskanen, Antti; Tiihonen, Jari; Hartikainen, Sirpa; Tolppanen, Anna-Maija","J. gerontol.

This cross-sectional, multi-methods study examined differences in language used to describe personal experiences, and mental health, based on sleep quality during the early stages of the pandemic. N = 1745 participants (mean age 42.97 ± 14.46 years) from 63 countries responded to the survey. Sleep quality was assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and mental health was examined using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Perceived Stress Scale and the UCLA-Loneliness Scale. Quantitative analysis of qualitative, language content of personal experiences was conducted using free-text responses and comments to a question on the survey. Almost 50% of the participants reported poor sleep quality, which was linked to a more negative emotional tone and greater mentions of money or finance related words. Good sleepers reported more positive emotional tone in their experiences. Greater reports of clinical state anxiety, moderate depression and moderate stress were observed in poor sleepers, even after accounting for demographics and pandemic-related factors such as loneliness, financial concerns and risk of contracting COVID-19 disease. Results from this study highlight an urgent need for sleep-related public health interventions. Practitioner education, sleep screening for those with mental health conditions, and encouraging people to adopt digital tools may help to reduce the burden of poor sleep on mental health. While the pandemic itself is a stressful and uncertain time, improving sleep can support positive emotion regulation, improving mood and consequential action.","Varma, Prerna; Burge, Malisa; Meaklim, Hailey; Junge, Moira; Jackson, Melinda L",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,359

Participants were divided into four groups based on their degree of threat from COVID-19: Group 1 was most closely associated with COVID-19, including inpatients diagnosed with COVID-19, first-line hospital workers and first-line management staff; Group 2 included outpatients diagnosed with COVID-19 and patients who developed a fever and visited the hospital; Group 3 included people related to Group 1 or 2, such as their colleagues, relatives, friends and rescuers; and Group 4 was the farthest removed from contact with COVID-19, covering the general public affected by COVID-19 prevention strategies. The Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) and Acute Stress Disorder Scale (ASDS) were used. RESULTS: Threat degree of COVID-19 (groups) had significant correlations with insomnia, depression, anxiety, and stress (p < 0.05, p < 0.01). Age, gender, and area (Hubei province or other provinces) had significant correlations with insomnia (p < 0.01). A total of 1380 (24.46%) participants were suspected of having major depression based on the PHQ-9. Additionally, 1042 (18.47%) participants were suspected of having generalized anxiety disorder based on the GAD-7. A total of 892 (15.8%) of the participants had Acute Stress Disorder (ASD) according to the ASDS. The prevalence of clinical insomnia during the outbreak was 20.05% (1131) according to the ISI. The factors of satisfaction with the current sleep pattern and how perceptible the symptoms of the current sleep pattern are to other people (p < 0.05) and the middle (difficulty staying asleep) and terminal (waking up too early) (p < 0.01) factors of the ISI were significantly different across groups. A total of 1129 (20.01%) participants spent more than one hour awake in bed. CONCLUSION: The results indicated that insomnia is more severe in people who are female, young, living in the epicenter and experiencing a high degree of threat from COVID-19. As prevention and treatment efforts continue with regard to COVID-19, the general public has developed poor sleep hygiene habits, which deserve attention.","Lin, Li-Yu; Wang, Jie; Ou-Yang, Xiao-Yong; Miao, Qing; Chen, Rui; Liang, Feng-Xia; Zhang, Yang-Pu; Tang, Qing; Wang, Ting",Sleep medicine,,359
343572,CoviD-19: Testing the limits of human rights,2020,"One important aspect of learning is through verbal interactions with teachers or teaching assistants (TAs), which requires significant effort and puts a heavy burden on teachers Artificial intelligence has the potential to reduce their burden by automatically addressing the routine part of this interaction, which will free them up to focus on more important aspects of learning We explore the use of automated question answering methods to power virtual TAs in online course discussion forums, which are heavily relied on during the COVID-19 pandemic as classes transition online First, we focus on answering frequent and repetitive logistical questions and adopt a question answering framework that consists of two steps: retrieving relevant documents from a repository and extracting answers from retrieved documents The document repository consists of course materials that contain information on course logistics, e g , the syllabus, lecture slides, course emails, and prior discussion forum posts This question answering framework can help virtual TAs decide whether a question is answerable and how to answer it Second, we analyze the timing of student posts in discussion threads and develop a classifier to predict the timing of follow-up posts This classifier can help virtual TAs decide whether to respond to a question and when to do so We conduct experiments on data collected from an introductory physics course and discuss both the utility and limitations of our approach © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020","Zylich, B.; Viola, A.; Toggerson, B.; Al-Hariri, L.; Lan, A.","21st International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education, AIED 2020",,359
343611,Using a design thinking approach for an asynchronous learning platform during COVID-19,2021,"Objectives: The need for remote delivery of mental health interventions including instruction in meditation has become paramount in the wake of the current global pandemic. However, the support one may usually feel within the physical presence of an instructor may be weakened when interventions are delivered remotely, potentially impacting one's meditative experiences. Use of head-mounted displays (HMD) to display video-recorded instruction may increase one's sense of psychological presence with the instructor as compared to presentation via regular flatscreen (e.g., laptop) monitor. This research therefore evaluated a didactic, trauma-informed care approach to instruction in mindfulness meditation by comparing meditative responses to an instructor-guided meditation when delivered face-to-face vs. by pre-recorded 360° videos viewed either on a standard flatscreen monitor (2D format) or via HMD (i.e., virtual reality [VR] headset; 3D format). Methods: Young adults (n = 82) were recruited from a university introductory course and experienced a 360° video-guided meditation via HMD (VR condition, 3D format). They were also randomly assigned to practice the same meditation either via scripted face-to-face instruction (in vivo [IV] format) or when viewed on a standard laptop display (non-VR condition, 2D format). Positive and negative affect and meditative experience ratings were self-reported and participants' maintenance of focused attention to breathing (i.e., meditation breath attention scores [MBAS]) were recorded during each meditation. Results: Meditating in VR (3D format) was associated with a heightened experience of awe overall. When compared to face-to-face instruction (IV format), VR meditation was rated as less embarrassing but also less enjoyable and more tiring. When compared to 2D format, VR meditations were associated with greater experiences of relaxation, less distractibility from the process of breathing, and less fatigue. No differences were found between VR and non-VR meditation in concentration (MBAS). Baseline posttraumatic stress symptoms were risk factors for experiencing distress while meditating in either (VR and non-VR) instructional format. Of those who reported a preference for one format, approximately half preferred the VR format and approximately half preferred the IV format. Conclusions: Recorded 360° video instruction in meditation viewed with a HMD (i.e., VR/3D format) appears to offer some experiential advantage over instructions given in 2D format and may offer a safe-and for some even preferred-alternative to teaching meditation face-to-face.

343619,COVID-19 and gastrointestinal endoscopy in Belgium : uncertainty and ambiguity,2020,"The ongoing pandemic due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) caused COVID-19 has emerged as a severe threat to the life of human kind. The identification and designing of appropriate and reliable drug molecule for the treatment of COVID-19 patients is the pressing need of the present time. Among different drug targets, the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 is being considered as most effective target. In addition to the drug repurposing, different compounds of natural as well as synthetic origins are being investigated for their efficacy against different drug targets of SARS-CoV-2 virus. In that context, the chromone based natural flavonols have also exhibited significant antiviral properties against different targets of SARS-CoV-2. The in silico studies presented here discloses the efficacy of triarylchromones (TAC) as potential inhibitor against main protease of SARS-CoV-2. The molecular docking and ADMET study performed using 14 arylchromones which could easily be accessed through simple synthetic protocols, revealed best binding affinities in case of TAC-3 (-11.2 kcal/mol), TAC-4 (-10.5 kcal/mol), TAC-6 (-11.2 kcal/mol), TAC-7 (-10.0 kcal/mol). Additional validation studies including molecular dynamics simulation and binding energy calculation using MMGBSA for protein ligand complex for 100 ns revealed the best binding interaction of TAC-3, TAC-4, TAC-6, TAC-7 against main protease of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the in vitro and preclinical validation of identified compounds will help us to understand the molecular mechanisms of regulation of TACs against SARS-CoV-2.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

343751,Effectiveness of COVID-19 diagnosis and management tools: A review,2020,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 is rapidly transmitted and has aroused enormous concern globally. This study aimed to investigate the effect of hydrocolloid dressing combined with 3M Cavilon No-Sting Barrier Film on the prevention of facial pressure injury in medical staff tasked with preventing and controlling COVID-19. METHODS: This was a self-controlled study. Medical staff who treated patients with COVID-19 infection in isolation wards from 6 January to 2 February, 2020, were selected to participate. Phase I was defined as the first 2 weeks of medical personnel entering the isolation ward, with phase II being the following 2 weeks. In phase I, medical workers only used hydrocolloid dressing on their faces, and in phase II, they used both hydrocolloid dressing and 3M Cavilon No-Sting Barrier Film. RESULTS: A total of 116 medical workers were selected as research subjects. The average facial local temperature in phase I was higher than that in phase II from the baseline (day 1) to the end of the study (day 14); however, there was no statistically significant difference (P>0.05). The incidence of facial pressure injury in phase II was lower than that in phase I (P<0.05); the facial skin comfort level among medical staff in phase II was higher than that in phase I (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Hydrocolloid dressing combined with 3M Cavilon No-Sting Barrier Film for facial skin care can effectively reduce the incidence of facial pressure injury and can improve skin comfort level while ensuring isolation and a protective effect.","Zhang, Shuanghong; Hu, Shidong; Chen, Hezhen; Jia, Xiaohui",Ann Palliat Med,,359

Case of COVID-19 Virus Outbreak,2020,"BACKGROUND: In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there is an urgent need for comprehensive performance evaluation and clinical utility assessment of serological assays to understand the immune response to SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: IgM/IgG and total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were measured by a cyclic enhanced fluorescence assay (CEFA) and a microsphere immunoassay (MIA), respectively. Independent performance evaluation included imprecision, reproducibility, specificity and cross-reactivity (CEFA n = 320, MIA n = 364). Clinical utility was evaluated by both methods in 87 patients at initial emergency department visit, 28 during subsequent hospitalizations (106 serial samples), and 145 convalescent patients. Totally 916 patients and 994 samples were evaluated. RESULTS: Agreement of CEFA and MIA was 90.4%-94.5% (Kappa: 0.81-0.89) in 302 samples. CEFA and MIA detected SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 26.2% and 26.3%, respectively, of ED patients. Detection rates increased over time reaching 100% after 21 days post-symptom onset. Longitudinal antibody kinetic changes by CEFA and MIA measurements correlated well and exhibited three types of seroconversion. Convalescent sera showed a wide range of antibody levels. CONCLUSION: Rigorously validated CEFA and MIA assays are reliable for detecting antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and show promising clinical utility when evaluating immune response in hospitalized and convalescent patients, but are not useful for early screening at patient's initial ED visit.","Yang, He S; Racine-Brzostek, Sabrina E; Lee, William T; Hunt, Danielle; Yee, Jim; Chen, Zhengming; Kubiak, Jeffrey; Cantu, Miguel; Hatem, Layla; Zhong, Elaine; D039,; Ambrosio, Danielle; Chadburn, Amy; Westblade, Lars; Glesby, Marshall; Loda, Massimo; Cushing, Melissa M; Zhao, Zhen",Clin Chim Acta,,359
345242,Covid-19: US gives emergency approval to hydroxychloroquine despite lack of evidence,2020,"Introduction La vaccination contre la COVID-19 est devenue le nouvel espoir pour enrayer la pandémie. Le but de cette étude était d’évaluer les freins et déterminants de cette vaccination parmi le personnel hospitalier, juste avant que ne débute la campagne officielle de vaccination. Matériels et méthodes Une étude transversale multicentrique a été menée auprès de l’ensemble des personnels hospitaliers de 11 hôpitaux et cliniques d’une région française en décembre 2020, afin d’évaluer les freins et les déterminants à la vaccination contre la COVID-19. Des analyses uni- et multivariées ont été effectuées pour identifier les facteurs associés à l’hésitation à la vaccination. Résultats Au total, 1964 réponses ont été analysées : 78 % de femme, âge moyen 42 ans, 21,5 % de profession médicale, 41 % travaillaient en établissement privé. Au total, 1048 (53 %) travailleurs hospitaliers étaient en faveur de la vaccination contre la COVID-19. Le genre féminin, le jeune âge, les professions paramédicales, techniques et administratives (c.-à-d. non médicales), ainsi que le secteur privé étaient associées de façon indépendante à une plus grande défiance envers le vaccin (p&lt;0,05). La méfiance envers les autorités de santé et les lobbies pharmaceutiques étaient les principaux freins à la vaccination. À l’inverse, créer une immunité de groupe, protéger ses proches et ses patients étaient les principales motivations à la vaccination. Plus de 70 % des participants trouvaient que la période de recherche avait été trop courte. La plupart des participants étaient intéressés par une information écrite sur les vaccins disponibles, mais les catégories socioprofessionnelles les plus réticentes préféraient une information orale. Seuls 35 % étaient favorables à une obligation vaccinale. Conclusion Il existe une surprenante importante défiance vis-à-vis de la vaccination COVID-19 chez les travailleurs en établissements de santé. Sur la base des informations recueillies sur les freins à la vaccination, des campagnes d’information écrites, orales et surtout ciblées (selon la profession, l’âge, le type d’établissement…) seront nécessaires pour améliorer la couverture vaccinale des personnels hospitaliers. Rendre obligatoire la vaccination pourrait être contre-productif.","Navarre, C.; Fabre, M.; Esparcieux, A.; Issartel, B.; Dutertre, M.; Blanc-Gruyelle, A.; Suy, F.; Adelaide, L.; Champagne, H.; Saison, J.",Infectious Diseases Now,,359

345463,"Impact of COVID-19 vaccination program on seroprevalence in blood donors in England, 2021",2021,"This article briefly describes Egypt's acute respiratory infection (ARI) epidemic preparedness and containment plan and illustrates the impact of implementation of the plan on combating the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic in Egypt. Pillars of the plan include crisis management, enhancing surveillance systems and contact tracing, case and hospital management, raising community awareness, and quarantine and entry points. To identify the impact of the implementation of the plan on epidemic mitigation, a literature review was performed of studies published from Egypt in the early stage of the pandemic. In addition, data for patients with COVID-19 from February to July 2020 were obtained from the National Egyptian Surveillance system and studied to describe the situation in the early stage of the epidemic in Egypt. The lessons learned indicated that the single most important key to success in early-stage epidemic containment is the commitment of all partners to a predeveloped and agreed-upon preparedness plan. This information could be useful for other countries in the region and worldwide in mitigating future anticipated ARI epidemics and pandemics. Postepidemic evaluation is needed to better assess Egypt's national response to the COVID-19 epidemic.","Abu El Sood, Hanaa; Abu Kamer, Shimaa Ali; Kamel, Reham; Magdy, Hesham; Osman, Fatma S; Fahim, Manal; Mohsen, Amira; AbdelFatah, Mohamad; Hassany, Mohamed; Afifi, Salma; Eid, Alaa",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,359

The aim of this retrospective single-center study was to investigate the impact of hypovitaminosis D and secondary hyperparathyroidism on respiratory outcomes of COVID-19. METHODS: Three-hundred-forty-eight consecutive patients hospitalized for COVID-19 at the IRCCS Humanitas Research Hospital, Rozzano, Milan (Italy) were evaluated for arterial partial pressure oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) ratio, serum 25hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D], parathyroid hormone (PTH) and inflammatory parameters at study entry and need of ventilation during the hospital stay. RESULTS: In the entire population, vitamin D deficiency (i.e., 25(OH)D values < 12 ng/mL) was significantly associated with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure at the study entry [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.48, 95% confidence interval 1.29-4.74; P = 0.006], independently of age and sex of subjects, serum calcium and inflammatory parameters. In patients evaluated for serum PTH (97 cases), secondary hyperparathyroidism combined with vitamin D deficiency was significantly associated with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure at study entry (P = 0.001) and need of ventilation during the hospital stay (P = 0.031). CONCLUSION: This study provides evidence that vitamin D deficiency, when associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism, may negatively impact the clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2-related pneumonia.","Mazziotti, G; Lavezzi, E; Brunetti, A; Mirani, M; Favacchio, G; Pizzocaro, A; Sandri, M T; Di Pasquale, A; Voza, A; Ciccarelli, M; Lania, A G",J. endocrinol. invest,,359
347200,First case of COVID-19 in Ireland,2020,"Twenty years ago, an enzyme homologous to the previously known angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was identified, and subsequently named ACE2. In the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), ACE2 has counter-regulatory functions against the classical effector peptide angiotensin II, for example in blood pressure regulation and cardiovascular remodeling. However, ACE2 provides an initially unexpected interesting link between virology and cardiovascular medicine. That is, ACE2 represents the binding receptor for the cellular uptake of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viruses. Thus, ACE2 is relevant for COVID-19. In this context, it was suspected that therapy with RAS blockers might promote transmission and complications of COVID-19 by upregulation of ACE2 expression. The aim of this short review is, to describe the link between the RAS, particularly ACE2, and COVID-19. Based on our analysis and evaluation of the available findings, we justify our conclusion: important drugs such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers should continue to be prescribed according to guidelines to stable patients in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Kreutz, Reinhold; Abd El-Hady Algharably, Engi; Ganten, Detlev; Messerli, Franz",Dtsch Med Wochenschr,,359

Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been identified as the cause of COVID-19, which spread throughout China and subsequently, across the world. As COVID-19 causes serious public health concerns across the world, investigating the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and its interaction with the host immune responses may provide a clearer picture of how the pathogen causes disease in some individuals. Interestingly, SARS-CoV-2 has 80% sequence homology with SARS-CoV-1 and 96-98% homology with CoVs isolated from bats. Therefore, the experience acquired in SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) epidemics may improve our understanding of the immune response and immunopathological changes in COVID-19 patients. In the present paper, we have reviewed the immune responses (including the innate and adaptive immunities) to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, so as to improve our understanding of the concept of the COVID-19 disease, which will be helpful in developing vaccines and medications for treating the COVID-19 patients.","Vafaeinezhad, Arefe; Atashzar, Mohammad Reza; Baharlou, Rasoul",Int Arch Allergy Immunol,,359

347971,Modern opportunities of interferons in treatment of children with COVID-19,2021,"Containing the global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has been an unprecedented challenge due to high horizontal transmissivity and asymptomatic carriage rates. Lateral flow device (LFD) immunoassays were introduced in late 2020 to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic or presymptomatic individuals rapidly. While LFD technologies have been used for over 60 years, their widespread use as a public health tool during a pandemic is unprecedented. By the end of 2020, data from studies into the efficacy of the LFDs emerged and showed these point-of-care devices to have very high specificity (ability to identify true negatives) but inadequate sensitivity with high false-negative rates. The low sensitivity (<50%) shown in several studies is a critical public health concern, as asymptomatic or presymptomatic carriers may wrongly be assumed to be noninfectious, posing a significant risk of further spread in the community. Here, we show that the direct visual readout of SARS-CoV-2 LFDs is an inadequate approach to discriminate a potentially infective viral concentration in a biosample. We quantified significant immobilized antigen-antibody-labeled conjugate complexes within the LFDs visually scored as negative using high-sensitivity synchrotron X-ray fluorescence imaging. Correlating quantitative X-ray fluorescence measurements and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) determined numbers of viral copies, we identified that negatively scored samples could contain up to 100 PFU (equivalent here to â¼10â¯000 RNA copies/test). The study demonstrates where the shortcomings arise in many of the current direct-readout SARS-CoV-2 LFDs, namely, being a deficiency in the readout as opposed to the potential level of detection of the test, which is orders of magnitude higher. The present findings are of importance both to public health monitoring during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to the rapid refinement of these tools for immediate and future applications.","Koller, Garrit; Morrell, Alexander P; Galão, Rui Pedro; Pickering, Suzanne; MacMahon, Eithne; Johnson, Joanna; Ignatyev, Konstantin; Neil, Stuart J D; Elsharkawy, Sherif; Fleck, Roland; Machado, Pedro Miguel Pereira; Addison, Owen",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),,359

Drawing on existing and planned uses of these systems, we focus on the sports stadium as a site for considering how biometric surveillance is introduced, implemented, and normalized. The themes of convergence, preemption, and spatiality are central to the messages presented in the industry's promotional materials, framing facial recognition technology as an essential component of the contemporary media-stadium. The immense popularity of mega-events and the pleasures of live sports erode the contestability of this framing, drawing attention away from the biases, inaccuracies, privacy concerns, and inequalities perpetuated by highly invasive systems that exercise social control in and beyond the stadium.","Hutchins, B.; Andrejevic, M.",International Journal of Communication,,359

In this review, we discuss recent findings pertaining to the biological mechanisms underlying infectious diseases, including etiology, pathogenesis, and the cellular interactions with infectious agents. We present advances in modeling techniques that have led to fundamental disease discoveries and impacted clinical translation. Recent Findings: Combining mechanistic models and machine learning algorithms has led to improvements in the treatment of Shigella and tuberculosis through the development of novel compounds. Modeling of the epidemic dynamics of malaria at the within-host and between-host level has afforded the development of more effective vaccination and antimalarial therapies. Similarly, in-host and host-host models have supported the development of new HIV treatment modalities and an improved understanding of the immune involvement in influenza. In addition, large-scale transmission models of SARS-CoV-2 have furthered the understanding of coronavirus disease and allowed for rapid policy implementations on travel restrictions and contract tracing apps. Summary: Computational modeling is now more than ever at the forefront of infectious disease research due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This review highlights how infectious diseases can be better understood by connecting scientists from medicine and molecular biology with those in computer science and applied mathematics.","Jenner, Adrianne L; Aogo, Rosemary A; Davis, Courtney L; Smith, Amber M; Craig, Morgan",Curr Pathobiol Rep,,359

352377,Converting the maybes: Crucial for a successful COVID-19 vaccination strategy,2021,"In recent years, the necessity of providing online interventions for adolescents, as an alternative to face-to-face interventions, has become apparent due to several barriers some adolescents face in accessing treatment. This need has become more critical with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic impacting the delivery of psychotherapy and limiting accessibility of face-to-face therapy. Whilst it has been established that face-to-face psychotherapy for adolescents with personality disorder can be effective in reducing the impact these complex mental illnesses have on functioning, online interventions for adolescents are rare, and to our knowledge there are no empirically validated online interventions for personality disorder. The development of novel online interventions are therefore necessary. To inform the development of online interventions for adolescents with personality disorder or symptoms of emerging personality disorder, a two-phase rapid review was conducted. Phase one consisted of a search and examination of existing online mental health programs for adolescents with symptoms of personality disorder, to understand how to best use online platforms. Phase two consisted of a rapid review of empirical literature examining online interventions for adolescents experiencing symptoms of personality disorder to identify characteristics that promote efficacy. There were no online programs specific to personality disorder in adolescence. However, 32 online mental health programs and 41 published empirical studies were included for analysis. Common intervention characteristics included timeframes of one to two months, regular confidential therapist contact, simple interactive online components and modules, and the inclusion of homework or workbook activities to practice new skills. There is an urgent need for online interventions targeting personality dysfunction in adolescence. Several characteristics of effective online interventions for adolescents were identified. These characteristics can help inform the development and implementation of novel online treatments to prevent and reduce the burden and impact of personality disorder, or symptoms of emerging personality disorder, in adolescents. This has implications for the COVID-19 pandemic when access to effective on- line interventions has become more urgent.

We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to get the optimum cutoff value of D-dimer levels on admission and after 5 days. We used these cutoffs to divide patients into two groups and compare the in-hospital mortality between them to assess the prognosis value of D-dimer levels. Results: the data of COVID-19 patients from March 21, 2020 to April 24, 2020 were retrieved from the Cheick Khalifa Hospital database. We used the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to get the optimum cutoff value of D-dimer levels on admission and after 5 days. We used these cutoffs to divide patients into two groups and compare the in-hospital mortality between them to assess the prognosis value of D-dimer levels. 89 patients were included in this study, of whom 79 were discharged and 10 died in hospital. The optimum cutoff value to predict mortality in patient using D-dimer levels on admission was 668 ng/ml (sensitivity 90%, specificity 63.3%, Areas under the ROC curve 0,775). As for D-dimer levels on day 5, it was 1360 ng/ml (sensitivity 100%, specificity 88,6%, Areas under the ROC curve 0.946). The group with D-dimer levels on day 5 > 1360 ng/ml (19 patients) had a worst evolution and a higher incidence of mortality compared to the group with D-dimer < 1360 ng/ml (69 patients) (10/19 vs 0/69, P = 0,0002). Conclusion: D-dimer greater than 1360 ng/ml on day 5 could help clinicians identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage of COVID-19.","Oualim, Sara; Abdeladim, Salma; Ouarradi, Amal El; Bensahi, Ilham; Hafid, Sara; Naitlho, Abdelhamid; Bouaiti, Elarbi; Sabry, Mohamed",Pan Afr Med J,,359

We have developed procedures for the standard PRNT, microneutralization assay (MNA) and pseudotyped virus neutralization assay (PNA) for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The MNA offers advantages over the PRNT by reducing assay time, allowing increased throughput and reducing operator workload while remaining dependent upon the use of wild-type virus. This ensures that all severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 antigens are present, but Biosafety Level 3 facilities are required. In addition to the advantages of MNA, PNA can be performed with lower biocontainment (Biosafety Level 2 facilities) and allows for further increases in throughput. For each new vaccine, it is critical to ensure good correlation of the neutralizing activity measured using PNA against the PRNT or MNA. These assays have been used in the development and licensure of the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca; Oxford University) and Ad26.COV2.S (Janssen) coronavirus disease 2019 vaccines and are critical for demonstrating bioequivalence of future vaccines.","Bewley, Kevin R; Coombes, Naomi S; Gagnon, Luc; McInroy, Lorna; Baker, Natalie; Shaik, Imam; St-Jean, Julien R; St-Amant, Natalie; Buttigieg, Karen R; Humphries, Holly E; Godwin, Kerry J; Brunt, Emily; Allen, Lauren; Leung, Stephanie; Brown, Phillip J; Penn, Elizabeth J; Thomas, Kelly; Kulnis, Greg; Hallis, Bassam; Carroll, Miles; Funnell, Simon; Charlton, Sue",Nat Protoc,,359

One common issue among these applications is that they are generally based on project-specific solutions and developed from scratch. Such application development fashion results in large amounts of repetitive effort, for example, in building study specific websites and mobile frontends, deploying customised infrastructures, and collecting data that may have already been collected in other studies and projects. What is worse, the data collected, and functions built cannot be easily reused by other applications. In this paper, we present an event-driven microservice platform, namely DHLink, to address this issue. DHLink securely links existing digital health applications of different projects, facilitates real-time data sharing, and supports rapid application development by reusing data and functions of existing digital health applications. In addition, comes with DHLink, a set of highly generic and reusable microservices is provided, which allows developers to rapidly create a typical above-mentioned digital health application by only developing the core algorithms. Two use cases outlined in this paper have shown the use of DHLink and the set of microservices for application collaboration and new application development to be efficient and practical.","Li, Wenhao; Bidargaddi, Niranjan; Fouyaxis, John",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.05191v1.pdf,359

Currently, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the infection as a global pandemic and there is a health and social emergency for the management of this new infection. While most people with COVID-19 develop only mild or uncomplicated illness, approximately 14% develop severe disease that requires hospitalization and oxygen support, and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit. In severe cases, COVID-19 can be complicated by the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, and multiorgan failure. This consensus document has been prepared on evidence-informed guidelines developed by a multidisciplinary panel of health care providers from four Spanish scientific societies (Spanish Society of Intensive Care Medicine [SEMICYUC], Spanish Society of Pulmonologists [SEPAR], Spanish Society of Emergency [SEMES], Spanish Society of Anesthesiology, Reanimation, and Pain [SEDAR]) with experience in the clinical management of patients with COVID-19 and other viral infections, including SARS, as well as sepsis and ARDS. The document provides clinical recommendations for the noninvasive respiratory support (noninvasive ventilation, high flow oxygen therapy with nasal cannula) in any patient with suspected or confirmed presentation of COVID-19 with acute respiratory failure. This consensus guidance should serve as a foundation for optimized supportive care to ensure the best possible chance for survival and to allow for reliable comparison of investigational therapeutic interventions as part of randomized controlled trials.","Cinesi Gómez, C; Peñuelas Rodríguez, Ó; Luján Torné, M L; Egea Santaolalla, C; Masa Jiménez, J F; García Fernández, J; Carratalá Perales, J M; Heili-Frades, S B; Ferrer Monreal, M; de Andrés Nilsson, J M; Lista Arias, E; Sánchez Rocamora, J L; Garrote, J I; Zamorano Serrano, M J; González Martínez, M; Farrero Muñoz, E; Mediano San Andrés, O; Rialp Cervera, G; Mas Serra, A; Hernández Martínez, G; de Haro López, C; Roca Gas, O; Ferrer Roca, R; Romero Berrocal, A; Ferrando Ortola, C",Rev Esp Anestesiol Reanim,,359

Similarly, despite the recognition of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2), and the role of ACE2 in lung injury; there are conflicting results with the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) in these patients.

This investigation presents molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and free energy calculation studies of saikosaponins as adjuvant therapy in the treatment for COVID19. Molecular docking studies for 23 saikosaponins on the crystal structures of the extracellular domains of human lnterleukin-6 receptor (IL6), human Janus Kinase-3 (JAK3), and dehydrogenase domain of Cylindrospermum stagnale NADPH-oxidase 5 (NOX5) were performed, and selected protein-ligand complexes were subjected to 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations. The molecular dynamics trajectories were subjected to free energy calculation by the MM-GBSA method. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation studies revealed that IL6 in complex with Saikosaponin_U and Saikosaponin_V, JAK3 in complex with Saikosaponin_B4 and Saikosaponin_I, and NOX5 in complex with Saikosaponin_BK1 and Saikosaponin_C have good docking and molecular dynamics profiles. However, the Janus Kinase-3 is the best interacting partner for the saikosaponin compounds. The network pharmacology analysis suggests saikosaponins interact with the proteins CAT Gene CAT (Catalase) and Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHEK1); both of these enzymes play a major role in cell homeostasis and DNA damage during infection, suggesting a possible improvement in immune response toward COVID-19.","Chikhale, Rupesh; Sinha, Saurabh K; Wanjari, Manish; Gurav, Nilambari S; Ayyanar, Muniappan; Prasad, Satyendra; Khanal, Pukar; Dey, Yadu Nandan; Patil, Rajesh B; Gurav, Shailendra S",Mol. divers,,359

METHODS: In a retrospective cohort study conducted in 347 patients hospitalized for COVID-19 (Bichat Hospital, Paris, France, 23 January-29 April 2020), RAAS blocker exposure, as well as timing and reason for treatment modifications, were collected. The association between exposure and mortality within 30 days of hospital admission was analysed using logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, sex, and comorbidities. RESULTS: Median age was 61 [interquartile range, 51-72] years, 209 (60%) were male, 169 (49%) had a history of treated hypertension, and 117 (34%) received a RAAS blocker prior to hospitalization. RAAS blockers were discontinued within the first 7 days of hospital admission in 33% of previously treated patients (mostly driven by severity of the disease), with a corresponding mortality rate of 33%. Mortality was 8% when treatment was maintained or introduced, and 12% in patients never exposed. Adjusted odds ratios for association between exposure and mortality were 0.62 (95% confidence interval 0.25-1.48) based on chronic exposure and 0.25 (0.09-0.65) based on in-hospital exposure. CONCLUSION: A 'healthy user-sick stopper' bias influences RAAS blocker prescription after hospital admission for COVID-19, and explains the seemingly favourable outcome associated with in-hospital treatment.","Lahens, Alexandre; Mullaert, Jimmy; Gressens, Simon; Gault, Nathalie; Flamant, Martin; Deconinck, Laurène; Joly, Véronique; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Lescure, François-Xavier; Vidal-Petiot, Emmanuelle",J. hypertens,,359
365763,COVID-19 and stroke: A review,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly affected health care organizations globally. Many aspects of this disease, as well as the risks for patients treated with multiple drug regimens to control severe COVID-19, are unclear. During emergency surgery for SARS-CoV-2-positive patients, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 exposure and transmission to the surgical staff has yet to be determined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this report, we describe a SARS-CoV-2-positive patient with severe respiratory syndrome treated with multiple doses of IL-6 inhibitors who presented with a perforated duodenal ulcer and underwent emergency surgery. During and after surgery, we tested for SARS-CoV-2 at the ulcer site and in the peritoneal fluid. RESULTS: The history of the patient allows for two possible interpretations of the pathogenesis of the duodenal ulcer, which could have been a stress ulcer, or a gastrointestinal ulcer associated to the use of IL-6 inhibitors. We also noticed that the ulcer site and peritoneal fluid repeatedly tested negative for SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we reviewed the pertinent literature on gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with COVID-19 and on SARS-CoV-2 detection in the peritoneal fluid of surgical patients and discussed possible prevention strategies for bleeding and the actual risk of infection for the surgical staff. CONCLUSIONS: The first implication of this case is that the relation between repeated administration of IL-6 inhibitors and upper gastrointestinal bleeding and perforation must be investigated, and that the threshold for administering prophylactic proton pump inhibitors therapy should be carefully considered for patients with severe COVID-19. The second implication is that further testing should be performed on the peritoneal fluid of COVID-19 patients undergoing emergency surgical procedures to clarify the discordant results for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the peritoneal cavity and the possible risk of transmission to the surgical staff.","Agnes, A; La Greca, A; Tirelli, F; Papa, V",Eur Rev Med Pharmacol Sci,,359

366668,Hydroxychloroquine can potentially interfere with immune function in COVID-19 patients: Mechanisms and insights,2021,"BACKGROUND: Infection with SARS-CoV-2 is responsible for the COVID-19 crisis affecting the whole world. This virus can provoke acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leading to overcrowed the intensive care unit (ICU). Over the last months, worldwide experience demonstrated that the ARDS in COVID-19 patients are in many ways ""atypical"". The mortality rate in ventilated patients is high despite the application of the gold standard treatment (protective ventilation, curare, prone position, inhaled NO). Several studies suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 could interact negatively on red blood cell homeostasis. Furthermore, SarsCov2 creates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which are toxic and generate endothelial dysfunction. Hypothesis/objective(s) We hypothesis that HEMO2Life® administrated intravenously is safe and could help symptomatically the patient condition. It would increase arterial oxygen content despite lung failure and allow better tissue oxygenation control. The use of HEMO2Life® is also interesting due to its anti-oxidative effect preventing cytokine storm induced by the SARS-CoV-2. Evaluation of the hypothesis: Hemarina is based on the properties of the hemoglobin of the Arenicola marina sea-worm (HEMO2Life®). This extracellular hemoglobin has an oxygen capacity 40 times greater than the hemoglobin of vertebrates. Furthermore, the size of this molecule is 250 times smaller than a human red blood cell, allowing it to diffuse in all areas of the microcirculation, without diffusing outside the vascular sector. It possesses an antioxidative property du a Superoxide Dismutase Activity. This technology has been the subject of numerous publications and HEMO2Life® was found to be well-tolerated and did not induce toxicity. It was administered intravenously to hamsters and rats, and showed no acute effect on heart rate and blood pressure and did not cause microvascular vasoconstriction. In preclinical in vivo models (mice, rats, and dogs), HEMO2Life® has enabled better tissue oxygenation, especially in the brain. This molecule has already been used in humans in organ preservation solutions and the patients showed no abnormal clinical signs. CONSEQUENCES OF THE HYPOTHESIS: The expected benefits of HEMO2Life® for COVID-19 patients are improved survival, avoidance of tracheal intubation, shorter oxygen supplementation, and the possibility of treating a larger number of patients as molecular respirator without to use an invasive machine.","Lupon, Elise; Lellouch, Alexandre G; Zal, Franck; Cetrulo, Curtis L; Lantieri, Laurent A",Med Hypotheses,,359

366767,What underlies the benefit of famotidine formulations used during COVID-19?,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Psychological research suggests that Black-White individuals are often conceptualized as Black and White, and that essentialist beliefs about race are negatively associated with conceptualizing Black-White individuals as such. The present research examined what people think it means to be Black and White (e.g., a mixture of Black and White vs. completely Black and completely White) and whether essentialism is indeed negatively associated with such concepts. METHOD: We used multiple methodologies (e.g., surveys, open-ended explanations, experimental manipulations) to examine how Black, White, and Black-White perceivers conceptualized Black-White individuals (Studies 1-3) and the extent to which essentialist beliefs, both dispositional (Studies 2-3) and experimentally induced (Study 4), predicted those concepts. RESULTS: We find that U.S. Black-White individuals most often conceptualized ""Black and White"" to mean a mixture of Black and White (Study 1), as did U.S. White individuals and U.S. Black individuals (Studies 2 and 3), and that racial essentialism-both dispositional (Studies 2 and 3) and experimentally manipulated (Study 4)-was positively associated with this conception. CONCLUSION: Our data shed new light on the complexity of race concepts and essentialism and advance the psychological understanding of Black-White identity.

Methods: A total of 21,865 patients were included in the analysis, 2,518 had obstructive lung disease and COVID-19. There were 1,370 [HA1] patients who had asthma and COVID-19, and 847 patients had COPD and COVID-19. There were 301 patients who had overlapping asthma and COPD diagnoses. There were 19,347 patients who had a diagnosis of COVID-19 without asthma or COPD. Logistic regression analysis of the data was performed. Results: Analysis of our data showed COPD patients with COVID-19 were more likely to be intubated as compared to the control group (OR 1.346 95% CI 1.061-1.707 p=0.0095). Additionally, there was no association between COPD and mortality in patients with COVID-19 (OR 0.845, 95% CI: 0.685-1.042 p=0.1436). There was no association between asthma and COVID-19 and intubation (OR 1.175 95% CI 0.936-1.475 p=0.2193). There was no statistical association between asthma and mortality in patients with COVID-19 (OR 0.849 95% CI 0.669-1.079 p=0.2455). However, patients with asthma were at a decreased risk of dying from COVID-19 compared to COPD patients with COVID-19 even after controlling for comorbid conditions (OR 0.718, 95% CI 0.526-0.979 p=0.0329). Patients presenting with asthma exacerbation or COPD exacerbation in the setting of COVID-19 infection were not at increased risk of death as compared to COPD or asthma patients with COVID-19 (Asthma exacerbation OR 1.042, 95% CI 0.62-1.73 p=0.8796), (COPD exacerbation OR 0.95 95% CI 0.67-1.36 p=0.762). Conclusion: Our finding with regards to intubation may be explained by an aggressive approach early on in the pandemic towards intubation especially in patients that may have been perceived as high-risk patients' due to underlying lung disease. Our data also showed no association between COPD and death in COVID-19 and asthma and mortality in COVID-19-meaning COPD and Asthma were not risk factors for death in our patient population. As to why asthma patients were at decreased odds of dying compared to COPD patients may be related to the different pathophysiological mechanisms of asthma as compared to COPD or a small protective effect of inhaled corticosteroids. Lastly, presenting with an asthma exacerbation or COPD exacerbation in the setting of COVID-19 infection did not increase your odds of mortality.","Schwartz, J.; Birnbaum, B. R.; Ballenberger, M.

TRIAL DESIGN: A phase 3 prospective, multi-center, interventional, open label, 6-arm 2x2 factorial design study. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects will be recruited at the specialized COVID-19 wards and/or ICUs at 16 Belgian participating hospitals. Only adult (&#8805;18y old) patients will be recruited with recent (&#8804;16 days) COVID-19 infection and acute hypoxia (defined as PaO2/FiO2 below 350mmHg or PaO2/FiO2 below 280 on supplemental oxygen and immediately requiring high flow oxygen device or mechanical ventilation) and signs of systemic cytokine release syndrome characterized by high serum ferritin, or high D-dimers, or high LDH or deep lymphopenia or a combination of those, who have not been on mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours before randomisation. Patients should have had a chest X-ray and/or CT scan showing bilateral infiltrates within the last 2 days before randomisation. Patients with active bacterial or fungal infection will be excluded. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients will be randomized to 1 of 5 experimental arms versus usual care. The experimental arms consist of Anakinra alone (anti-IL-1 binding the IL-1 receptor), Siltuximab alone (anti-IL-6 chimeric antibody), a combination of Siltuximab and Anakinra, Tocilizumab alone (humanised anti-IL-6 receptor antibody) or a combination of Anakinra with Tocilizumab in addition to standard care. Patients treated with Anakinra will receive a daily subcutaneous injection of 100mg for a maximum of 28 days or until hospital discharge, whichever comes first. Siltuximab (11mg/kg) or Tocilizumab (8mg/kg, with a maximum dose of 800mg) are administered as a single intravenous injection immediately after randomization. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary end point is the time to clinical improvement defined as the time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a six-category ordinal scale measured daily till day 28 or discharge from the hospital or death. This ordinal scale is composed of (1) Death; (2) Hospitalized, on invasive mechanical ventilation or ECMO; (3) Hospitalized, on non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen devices; (4) Hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; (5) Hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen; (6) Not hospitalized. RANDOMISATION: Patients will be randomized using an Interactive Web Response System (REDCap). A 2x2 factorial design was selected with a 2:1 randomization regarding the IL-1 blockade (Anakinra) and a 1:2 randomization regarding the IL-6 blockade (Siltuximab and Tocilizumab). BLINDING (MASKING): In this open-label trial neither participants, caregivers, nor those assessing the outcomes are blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): A total of 342 participants will be enrolled: 76 patients will receive usual care, 76 patients will receive Siltuximab alone, 76 patients will receive Tocilizumab alone, 38 will receive Anakinra alone, 38 patients will receive Anakinra and Siltuximab and 38 patients will receive Anakinra and Tocilizumab. TRIAL STATUS: COV-AID protocol version 3.0 (15 Apr 2020). Participant recruitment is ongoing and started on April 4th 2020. Given the current decline of the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium, it is difficult to anticipate the rate of participant recruitment.

However, a general and quantitative justification of this statement stays lacking. Here we establish an observable-based error bound for such constrained dynamics in generic gapped quantum systems. This universal bound is a linear function of time that only involves the energy gap and coupling strength, provided that the latter is much smaller than the former. We demonstrate that both the intercept and the slope in the bound can asymptotically be saturated by simple models. We generalize the result to quantum many-body systems with local interactions, for which the coupling strength diverges in the thermodynamic limit while the error is found to grow no faster than a power law $t^{d+1}$ in $d$ dimensions. Our work establishes a universal and rigorous result concerning nonequilibrium quantum dynamics.","Gong, Zongping; Yoshioka, Nobuyuki; Shibata, Naoyuki; Hamazaki, Ryusuke",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.03419v2.pdf,359

Furthermore, it is hard to compare current COVID-19 CT segmentation methods as they are developed on different datasets, trained in different settings, and evaluated with different metrics. METHODS: To promote the development of data-efficient deep learning methods, in this paper, we built three benchmarks for lung and infection segmentation based on 70 annotated COVID-19 cases, which contain current active research areas, for example, few-shot learning, domain generalization, and knowledge transfer. For a fair comparison among different segmentation methods, we also provide standard training, validation and testing splits, evaluation metrics and, the corresponding code. RESULTS: Based on the state-of-the-art network, we provide more than 40 pretrained baseline models, which not only serve as out-of-the-box segmentation tools but also save computational time for researchers who are interested in COVID-19 lung and infection segmentation. We achieve average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) scores of 97.3%, 97.7%, and 67.3% and average normalized surface dice (NSD) scores of 90.6%, 91.4%, and 70.0% for left lung, right lung, and infection, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first data-efficient learning benchmark for medical image segmentation, and the largest number of pretrained models up to now. All these resources are publicly available, and our work lays the foundation for promoting the development of deep learning methods for efficient COVID-19 CT segmentation with limited data.","Ma, Jun; Wang, Yixin; An, Xingle; Ge, Cheng; Yu, Ziqi; Chen, Jianan; Zhu, Qiongjie; Dong, Guoqiang; He, Jian; He, Zhiqiang; Cao, Tianjia; Zhu, Yuntao; Nie, Ziwei; Yang, Xiaoping",Med. phys,,359

372454,Dual-Antigen System Allows Elimination of False Positive Results in COVID-19 Serological Testing,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Information on the prevalence of face mask use to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is needed to model disease spread and to assess the effectiveness of policies that encourage face mask use. We sought to (1) estimate the prevalence of face mask use in northern Vermont and (2) assess the effect of age and sex on the likelihood of face mask use. METHODS: We monitored the entrances to public businesses and visually assessed age, sex, and face mask use. We collected 1004 observations during May 16-30, 2020. We calculated estimates of overall face mask use and odds ratios (ORs) for effects by age and sex. RESULTS: Of 1004 observations, 758 (75.5%) sampled people used a face mask. Our census-weighted estimate was 74.1%. A higher percentage of females than males wore face masks (83.8% vs 67.6%). The odds of face mask use were lower among males than among females (OR = 0.52; 95% CI, 0.37-0.73). Face mask use generally decreased with decreasing age: 91.4% among adults aged >60, 70.7% among adults aged 26-60, 74.8% among people aged 15-25, and 53.3% among people aged &#8804;14. The OR of an adult aged >60 wearing a face mask was 14.70 times higher, for young people aged 15-25 was 2.72 times higher, and for adults aged 26-60 was 2.99 times higher than for people aged &#8804;14. Females aged >60 had the highest percentage of face mask use (96.3%) and males aged &#8804;14 had the lowest (43.8%). CONCLUSIONS: Educational efforts promoting the use of face masks should be targeted at males and younger age groups to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2.","Beckage, Brian; Buckley, Thomas E; Beckage, Maegan E",Public Health Rep,,359

An abnormal electrocardiogram is associated with poor outcome, and QT prolongation during the illness has been linked to pharmacological effects. This study sought to investigate the effects of the COVID-19 illness on the corrected QT interval (QTc). METHOD: For 293 consecutive patients admitted to our hospital via the emergency department for COVID-19 between 01/03/20 -18/05/20, demographic data, laboratory findings, admission electrocardiograph and clinical observations were compared in those who survived and those who died within 6 weeks. Hospital records were reviewed for prior electrocardiograms for comparison with those recorded on presentation with COVID-19. RESULTS: Patients who died were older than survivors (82 vs 69.8 years, p < 0.001), more likely to have cancer (22.3% vs 13.1%, p = 0.034), dementia (25.6% vs 10.7%, p = 0.034) and ischemic heart disease (27.8% vs 10.7%, p < 0.001). Deceased patients exhibited higher levels of C-reactive protein (244.6 mg/L vs 146.5 mg/L, p < 0.01), troponin (1982.4 ng/L vs 413.4 ng/L, p = 0.017), with a significantly longer QTc interval (461.1 ms vs 449.3 ms, p = 0.007). Pre-COVID electrocardiograms were located for 172 patients; the QTc recorded on presentation with COVID-19 was longer than the prior measurement in both groups, but was more prolonged in the deceased group (448.4 ms vs 472.9 ms, pre-COVID vs COVID, p < 0.01). Multivariate Cox-regression analysis revealed age, C-reactive protein and prolonged QTc of >455 ms (males) and >465 ms (females) (p = 0.028, HR 1.49 [1.04-2.13]), as predictors of mortality. QTc prolongation beyond these dichotomy limits was associated with increased mortality risk (p = 0.0027, HR 1.78 [1.2-2.6]). CONCLUSION: QTc prolongation occurs in COVID-19 illness and is associated with poor outcome.","Akhtar, Zaki; Gallagher, Mark M; Yap, Yee Guan; Leung, Lisa W M; Elbatran, Ahmed I; Madden, Brendan; Ewasiuk, Victoria; Gregory, Louise; Breathnach, Aodhan; Chen, Zhong; Fluck, David S; Sharma, Sumeet",Pacing Clin Electrophysiol,,359

COVID-19 has cast a shadow on nearly every aspect of society, straining health systems and economies across the world. While it is widely accepted that a close relationship exists between obesity, cardiovascular disease and metabolic disorders on infection, we are only beginning to understand ways in which the immunological sequelae of obesity functions as a predisposing factor related to poor clinical outcomes in COVID-19. As both the innate and adaptive immune systems are each primed by obesity, alteration of key pathways results in both an immunosuppressed and hyperinflammatory state. The present review will discuss the cellular and molecular immunology of obesity in the context of its role as a risk factor for severe COVID-19, discuss the role of cytokine storm, and draw parallels to prior viral epidemics such as SARS, MERS-COV and H1N1.

India has enforced a lockdown on 24th March 2020 and was subsequently extended in various phases. The lockdown due to the sudden spurt of the COVID-19 pandemic has shown a significant decline in concentration of air pollutants across India. The present article dealt with scenarios of air quality concentration of air pollutants, and effect on climatic variability during the COVID-19 lockdown period in Kolkata Metropolitan Area, India. The result showed that the air pollutants are significantly reduced and the air quality index (AQI) was improved during the lockdown months. Aerosol concentrations decreased by - 54.94% from the period of pre-lockdown. The major air pollutants like particulate matters (PM2.5, PM10), sulphur dioxide (SO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and Ozone (O3) were observed the maximum reduction ( - 40 to - 60%) in the COVID-19 lockdown period. The AQI has been improved by 54.94% in the lockdown period. On the other hand, Sen's slope rank and the Mann-Kendal trend test showed the daily decreased of air pollutants rate is - 0.051 to - 1.586 µg /m3. The increasing trend of daily minimum, average, and maximum temperature from the month of March to May in this year (2020s) are 0.091, 0.118, and 0.106 °C which is lowest than the 2016s to 2019s trend. Therefore, this research has an enormous opportunity to explain the effects of the lockdown on air quality and climate variability, and it can also be helpful for policymakers and decision-makers to enact appropriate measures to control air pollution.","Chowdhuri, Indrajit; Pal, Subodh Chandra; Arabameri, Alireza; Ngo, Phuong Thao Thi; Roy, Paramita; Saha, Asish; Ghosh, Manoranjan; Chakrabortty, Rabin",Stoch Environ Res Risk Assess,,359

Remote adaptations are of special importance for populations at risk, e.g. older adults and individuals with chronic medical comorbidities. In response to this urgent clinical and scientific need, we describe a remote adaptation of the T-RES (Oron et al. 2020; IJA), designed to assess the complex processing of spoken emotions, based on identification and integration of the semantics and prosody of spoken sentences. DESIGN: We present iT-RES, an online version of the speech-perception assessment tool, detailing the challenges considered and solution chosen when designing the telehealth tool. We show a preliminary validation of performance against the original lab-based T-RES. STUDY SAMPLE: A between-participants design, within two groups of 78 young adults (T-RES, n = 39; iT-RES, n = 39). RESULTS: i-TRES performance closely followed that of T-RES, with no group differences found in the main trends, identification of emotions, selective attention, and integration. CONCLUSIONS: The design of iT-RES mapped the main challenges for remote auditory assessments, and solutions taken to address them. We hope that this will encourage further efforts for telehealth adaptations of clinical services, to meet the needs of special populations and avoid halting scientific research.","Ben-David, Boaz M; Mentzel, Maya; Icht, Michal; Gilad, Maya; Dor, Yehuda I; Ben-David, Sarah; Carl, Micalle; Shakuf, Vered",Int J Audiol,,359

Structural studies have revealed distinct conformations of S, but real-time information that connects these structures is lacking. Here we apply single-molecule fluorescence (Förster) resonance energy transfer (smFRET) imaging to observe conformational dynamics of S on virus particles. Virus-associated S dynamically samples at least four distinct conformational states. In response to human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2), S opens sequentially into the hACE2-bound S conformation through at least one on-path intermediate. Conformational preferences observed upon exposure to convalescent plasma or antibodies suggest mechanisms of neutralization involving either competition with hACE2 for binding to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) or allosteric interference with conformational changes required for entry. Our findings inform on mechanisms of S recognition and conformations for immunogen design.","Lu, Maolin; Uchil, Pradeep D; Li, Wenwei; Zheng, Desheng; Terry, Daniel S; Gorman, Jason; Shi, Wei; Zhang, Baoshan; Zhou, Tongqing; Ding, Shilei; Gasser, Romain; Prévost, Jérémie; Beaudoin-Bussières, Guillaume; Anand, Sai Priya; Laumaea, Annemarie; Grover, Jonathan R; Liu, Lihong; Ho, David D; Mascola, John R; Finzi, Andrés; Kwong, Peter D; Blanchard, Scott C; Mothes, Walther",Cell Host Microbe,,359

Initial small-scale trials and studies have demonstrated the possible impact of the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and antibiotic azithromycin (AZM) unaided or together can be productive in the management of coronavirus disease. However, the latest research stretches on serious implications such as irregularities in the heart electrical impulses, polymorphic ventricular tachycardia including torsade de pointes (TdP), and long QT syndrome (LQTS) associated with the use of these drugs. In the worst-case scenario, higher doses have been lethal to the patients treated with these drugs as per recent reports. To have a closer look over the safety considerations, this review is focused on the latest updates, research, and findings of the impact of HCQ and AZM in COVID-19 affected individuals with an emphasis on the pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors. Besides, this review also briefly compiles some of the major clinical trial case reports which can present evident data related to the clinical application of both the drugs along with its abnormal effect on cardiac rhythm.","Mohammad, Firdous Sayeed; Karmakar, Varnita; Irfan, Zainab",Farmacia,,359

DESIGN: A rapid review of academic and grey literature sources from 29 April to 31 December 2020, covering non-urgent, non-COVID-19 healthcare. Sources were thematically synthesised against an adapted version of the UK Government's Pandemic Flu Ethical Framework to identify underpinning ethical principles. The strength of normative engagement and the quality of the sources were also assessed. SETTING: NHS maternity and paediatric surgery services in England. RESULTS: Searches conducted 8 September-12 October 2020, and updated in March 2021, identified 48 sources meeting the inclusion criteria. Themes that arose include: staff safety; collaborative working - including mutual dependencies across the healthcare system; reciprocity; and inclusivity in service recovery, for example, by addressing inequalities in service access. Embedded in the theme of staff and patient safety is embracing new ways of working, such as the rapid roll out of telemedicine. On assessment, many sources did not explicitly consider how ethical principles might be applied or balanced against one another. Weaknesses in the policy sources included a lack of public and user involvement and the absence of monitoring and evaluation criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that relationality is a prominent ethical principle informing resetting NHS non-COVID-19 paediatric surgery and maternity services. Sources explicitly highlight the ethical importance of seeking to minimise disruption to caring and dependent relationships, while simultaneously attending to public safety. Engagement with ethical principles was ethics-lite, with sources mentioning principles in passing rather than explicitly applying them. This leaves decision makers and healthcare professionals without an operationalisable ethical framework to apply to difficult reset decisions and risks inconsistencies in decision making. We recommend further research to confirm or refine the usefulness of the reset phase ethical framework developed through our analysis.","Chiumento, Anna; Baines, Paul; Redhead, Caroline; Fovargue, Sara; Draper, Heather; Frith, Lucy",BMJ Open,,359

Using the well-known laboratory/psychometric high-risk approach, the present study investigated the associations between nonpsychotic perceptual aberrations measured at age 18, in individuals with no prior history of psychosis, and clinical psychotic symptom outcomes 17 years later in midlife (middle 30s). Clinical assessments for hallucinations and delusions were completed for 191 adults (95% of the original sample) in the follow-up study. Elevated perceptual aberrations at age 18 predicted increased levels of hallucinations, delusions, and total psychotic symptoms in midlife as well as psychotic illness. The associations between baseline perceptual aberrations and later psychotic symptoms were not accounted for by general nonspecific psychopathology factors such as anxiety or depression present at age 18. Early detection of subtle, nonpsychotic forms of perceptual disturbance may aid in identifying individuals at increased risk for nonaffective psychosis outcomes in adulthood. Perceptual aberrations may constitute a useful endophenotype for genetic, neurobiological, and cognitive neuroscience investigations of schizophrenia liability.

The following strategies were identified efficacious: prompts/cues (SMD=3.29, 95% CI (1.97 to 4.62)), credible source (standardised mean difference, SMD=2.08, 95% CI (0.95;3.22)), adding objects to the environment (SMD=1.47, 95% CI (0.41 to 2.53)), generalisation of the target behaviour SMD=1.32, 95% CI (0.22 to 2.41)), monitoring of behaviour by others without feedback (SMD=1.02, 95% CI (0.05 to 1.98)), self-monitoring of outcome(s) of behaviour (SMD=0.79, 95% CI (0.06 to 1.52), graded tasks (SMD=0.73, 95% CI (0.22 to 1.24)), behavioural practice/rehearsal (SMD=0.72, 95% CI (0.26 to 1.18)), action planning (SMD=0.62, 95% CI (0.03 to 1.21)) and goal setting (behaviour) (SMD=0.56, 95% CI (0.03 to 1.08)). CONCLUSION: The meta-analysis suggests intervention characteristics that may be suitable for promoting physical activity in heart failure. There is moderate evidence in support of an exercise programme combined with a behavioural change intervention delivered by a physiotherapist in a group-based and centre-based settings.

379181,Development and evaluation of a novel protective device for upper gastrointestinal endoscopy in the COVID-19 pandemic: The EBOX,2020,"During the first two decades of the 21st century, there have been three coronavirus infection outbreaks raising global health concerns by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and the SARS-CoV-2. Although the reported imaging findings of coronavirus infection are variable and non-specific, the most common initial chest radiograph (CXR) and CT findings are ground-glass opacities and consolidation with peripheral predominance and eventually spread to involve both lungs as the disease progresses. These findings can be explained by the immune pathogenesis of coronavirus infection causing diffuse alveolar damage. Although it is insensitive in mild or early coronavirus infection, the CXR remains as the first-line and the most commonly used imaging modality. That is because it is rapid and easily accessible and helpful for monitoring patient progress during treatment. CT is more sensitive to detect early parenchymal lung abnormalities and disease progression, and can provide an alternative diagnosis. In this pictorial review, various coronavirus infection cases are presented to provide imaging spectrums of coronavirus infection and present differences in imaging among them or from other viral infections, and to discuss the role of imaging in viral infection outbreaks.","Franquet, Tomas; Jeong, Yeon Joo; Lam, Hiu Yin Sonia; Wong, Ho Yuen Frank; Chang, Yeun-Chung; Chung, Myung Jin; Lee, Kyung Soo",Br J Radiol,,359

In China, nurses are an important group contributing to the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pneumonia epidemic. METHODS: Using semi-structured interviews, qualitative interviews were conducted with 23 nurses who supported the novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic, and the data were collated and analyzed using Colaizzi analysis. RESULTS: The work experience of Chinese nurses can be summarized into 4 major themes: they had different emotional experiences during aiding periods, aiding work had a double impact on the nurses, there were certain difficulties in aiding work, and there were significant age differences in aiding work experience. CONCLUSIONS: It is necessary to strengthen the psychological construction of nurses. All hospitals must coordinate and manage various safety tasks, and ensure the precise, scientific, and streamlined deployment of rescue work. Humanized management, shift adjustment, performance allocation weight, and organizational care are also the top priorities of human resource management.","Li, Linbo; Hou, Yongchao; Kang, Fengying; Li, Suping; Zhao, Juan",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,359
379288,Circulating mitochondrial DNA is an early indicator of severe illness and mortality from COVID-19,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory infection caused by novel coronavirus 2019. Many individuals suffered psychological symptoms in the early stage when the epidemic was uncertain. We explored the perceived psychological stress and associated factors in the early stage of COVID-19 epidemic. METHOD: The Perceived Stress Scale, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire, Social Support Rating Scale and a general information questionnaire were integrated in an on-line survey conducted from February 1, 2020 until February 4, 2020. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to explore whether coping style, social support or other factors contributed to psychological stress. RESULTS: A total of 1638 participants were included, of whom 44.3% showed moderate psychological stress. Individuals who were younger, female, unmarried, spent more time on the disease, felt more concern about it, reported lower social support (Subjective Social support; Objective social support; Utilization social support), or showed a negative coping style were more likely to suffer higher psychological stress in the early stages of the COVID-19 epidemic. CONCLUSION: Psychological interventions may be targeted to individuals with the risk characteristics identified in this study. It may be helpful to promote social support and positive coping style in the early stage of infectious disease epidemics. This initial evidence from the general Chinese population may be relevant to interventions in other countries for dealing with the COVID-19 and other epidemics.","Yang, Xiao; Xiong, Zhenzhen; Li, Zhixiong; Li, Xiao; Xiang, Weiyi; Yuan, Yiwen; Li, Zhe",PLoS One,,359

Clinical testing for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 has rapidly become widespread, but data regarding the inter-laboratory performance of these serologic assays are limited. OBJECTIVE: - To describe the development and initial results of the College of American Pathologists (CAP) SARS-CoV-2 Serology Survey. DESIGN: - Members from the CAP Microbiology and Diagnostic Immunology and Flow Cytometry Committees formed a working group to support development of a new proficiency testing survey for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays. Supplemental questions in the survey assessed the state of SARS-CoV-2 serologic testing among participating laboratories as of July 2020. Results were analyzed for agreement by immunoglobulin isotype tested, assay manufacturer, and methodology. RESULTS: - A total of 4,125 qualitative results were received from 1,110 laboratories participating in the first survey. Qualitative agreement for assays measuring anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies or IgG was greater than 90% for all three samples in the survey. Qualitative agreement for IgM and IgA for the negative sample was greater than 95%, but lacked consensus for the other two samples. CONCLUSIONS: - These initial data suggest overall excellent agreement and comparable performance for most qualitative anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and total antibody assays across all participating clinical laboratories, regardless of specific target antigen or assay methodology.","Tacker, Danyel H; Bashleben, Christine; Long, Thomas C; Theel, Elitza S; Knight, Vijaya; Kadkhoda, Kamran; Rhoads, Daniel D; Linden, Michael A; Fink, Susan L",Arch. pathol. lab. med.

Nevertheless, many phases of matter are known to admit a sign-problem-free representative, allowing efficient simulations on classical computers. Motivated by long standing open problems in many-body physics, as well as fundamental questions in quantum complexity, the possibility of intrinsic sign problems, where a phase of matter admits no sign-problem-free representative, was recently raised but remains largely unexplored. Here, we establish the existence of an intrinsic sign problem in a broad class of gapped, chiral, topological phases of matter. Within this class, we exclude the possibility of stoquastic Hamiltonians for bosons (or 'qudits'), and of sign-problem-free determinantal Monte Carlo algorithms for fermions. The intrinsically sign-problematic class of phases we identify is defined in terms of topological invariants with clear observable signatures: the chiral central charge, and the topological spins of anyons. We obtain analogous results for phases that are spontaneously chiral, and present evidence for an extension of our results that applies to both chiral and non-chiral topological matter.","Golan, Omri; Smith, Adam; Ringel, Zohar",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.05566v1.pdf,359

The enzyme 3C-like protease (3CLpro) is essential for the maturation of viral polyproteins in SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore regarded as a key drug target for treating the disease. To identify 3CLpro inhibitors that can suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication, we performed a virtual screening of 500,282 compounds in a Korean compound bank. We then subjected the top computational hits to inhibitory assays against 3CLpro in vitro, leading to the identification of a class of non-covalent inhibitors. Among these inhibitors, compound 7 showed an EC50 of 39.89 µM against SARS-CoV-2 and CC50 of 453.5 µM.

380299,COVID-19 and immunomodulation in IBD,2020,"The lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak in 2019 (COVID-19) has caused psychological distress and cognitive discomfort for emerging adults, who have experienced increased rumination, intrusive thoughts and cognitive failures. States of mindfulness and being in the moment can prevent anxiety and fear associated with the lockdown and alleviate ruminative and automatic negative thinking. This longitudinal study investigated the role of mindfulness before and during the COVID-19 lockdown in protecting a sample of emerging adults from experiencing cognitive failures, intrusive thoughts and rumination and examined how lockdown-related variables-emotions, socio-economic status and housing conditions-influenced this mindfulness profile. The results showed overall more cognitive failures and rumination during lockdown, especially in participants whose mindfulness status diminished. However, these signs of cognitive distress remained stable or decreased among participants who reported improved changes in mindfulness. Financial difficulties and a reduced sense of privacy associated with the lockdown predicted lower stability in mindfulness profiles. The state of being fully aware of what is happening in the present moment may be helpful in reducing cognitive discomfort and psychological maladjustment, especially during stressful times such as lockdowns.","Lopez, Antonella; Caffò, Alessandro Oronzo; Tinella, Luigi; Di Masi, Manuela Nicoletta; Bosco, Andrea",Applied psychology.

We assessed risk and incidence rate of documented SARS-CoV-2 reinfection in a cohort of laboratory-confirmed cases in Qatar. METHODS: All SARS-CoV-2 laboratory-confirmed cases with at least one PCR positive swab that is &#8805;45 days after a first-positive swab were individually investigated for evidence of reinfection, and classified as showing strong, good, some, or weak/no evidence for reinfection. Viral genome sequencing of the paired first-positive and reinfection viral specimens was conducted to confirm reinfection. Risk and incidence rate of reinfection were estimated. RESULTS: Out of 133,266 laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, 243 persons (0.18%) had at least one subsequent positive swab &#8805;45 days after the first-positive swab. Of these, 54 cases (22.2%) had strong or good evidence for reinfection. Median time between first and reinfection swab was 64.5 days (range: 45-129). Twenty-three of the 54 cases (42.6%) were diagnosed at a health facility suggesting presence of symptoms, while 31 (57.4%) were identified incidentally through random testing campaigns/surveys or contact tracing. Only one person was hospitalized at time of reinfection, but was discharged the next day. No deaths were recorded. Viral genome sequencing confirmed four reinfections out of 12 cases with available genetic evidence. Reinfection risk was estimated at 0.02% (95% CI: 0.01-0.02%) and reinfection incidence rate at 0.36 (95% CI: 0.28-0.47) per 10,000 person-weeks. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 reinfection can occur but is a rare phenomenon suggestive of protective immunity against reinfection that lasts for at least a few months post primary infection.","Abu-Raddad, Laith J; Chemaitelly, Hiam; Malek, Joel A; Ahmed, Ayeda A; Mohamoud, Yasmin A; Younuskunju, Shameem; Ayoub, Houssein H; Al Kanaani, Zaina; Al Khal, Abdullatif; Al Kuwari, Einas; Butt, Adeel A; Coyle, Peter; Jeremijenko, Andrew; Kaleeckal, Anvar Hassan; Latif, Ali Nizar; Shaik, Riyazuddin Mohammad; Rahim, Hanan F Abdul; Yassine, Hadi M; Al Kuwari, Mohamed G; Al Romaihi, Hamad Eid; Al-Thani, Mohamed H; Bertollini, Roberto",Clin. infect. dis,,359

The Israeli defense force deployed further means to contain the disease, including putting units in quarantine, physical distancing and using masks, gowns and disinfectants when in contact with suspected patients. METHODS: We used reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR) tests to screen for patients among asymptomatic soldiers within units participating in civilian aid or in close contact with known patients, using personal protective equipment. Positive results were repeated and followed with serological testing to verify the nature of results. RESULTS: Between April and May 2020, we screened a total of 1,453 soldiers in 13 different units. We found 11 false positive results, leading to unnecessary measures until resolution, and three true positive results (0.2%). All true positive results had unreported symptoms concomitant with SARS-CoV-2 disease. These results led to the resolution of this screening policy. CONCLUSION: Screening asymptomatic army personnel in this setting with rt-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 is not warranted and leads to unnecessary false positive results.

Essential oils (EOs) have long been known to have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, bronchodilatory, and antiviral properties and are being proposed to have activity against SARC-CoV-2 virus. Owing to their lipophilic nature, EOs are advocated to penetrate viral membranes easily leading to membrane disruption. Moreover, EOs contain multiple active phytochemicals that can act synergistically on multiple stages of viral replication and also induce positive effects on host respiratory system including bronchodilation and mucus lysis. At present, only computer-aided docking and few in vitro studies are available which show anti-SARC-CoV-2 activities of EOs. In this review, role of EOs in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 is discussed. A discussion on possible side effects associated with EOs as well as anti-corona virus claims made by EOs manufacturers are also highlighted. Based on the current knowledge a chemo-herbal (EOs) combination of the drugs could be a more feasible and effective approach to combat this viral pandemic.","Asif, Muhammad; Saleem, Mohammad; Saadullah, Malik; Yaseen, Hafiza Sidra; Al Zarzour, Raghdaa",Inflammopharmacology,,359
384247,Discovery and characterization of ACE2 - a 20-year journey of surprises from vasopeptidase to COVID-19,2020,"Since December 2019, the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) pandemic has caused world-wide turmoil in a short period of time, and the infection, caused by SARS-CoV-2, is spreading rapidly. AI-driven tools are used to identify Coronavirus outbreaks as well as forecast their nature of spread, where imaging techniques are widely used, such as CT scans and chest X-rays (CXRs). In this paper, motivated by the fact that X-ray imaging systems are more prevalent and cheaper than CT scan systems, a deep learning-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, which we call Truncated Inception Net, is proposed to screen COVID-19 positive CXRs from other non-COVID and/or healthy cases. To validate our proposal, six different types of datasets were employed by taking the following CXRs: COVID-19 positive, Pneumonia positive, Tuberculosis positive, and healthy cases into account. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 99.96% (AUC of 1.0) in classifying COVID-19 positive cases from combined Pneumonia and healthy cases. Similarly, it achieved an accuracy of 99.92% (AUC of 0.99) in classifying COVID-19 positive cases from combined Pneumonia, Tuberculosis, and healthy CXRs. To the best of our knowledge, as of now, the achieved results outperform the existing AI-driven tools for screening COVID-19 using the acquired CXRs, and proves the viability of using the proposed Truncated Inception Net as a screening tool.","Das, Dipayan; Santosh, K C; Pal, Umapada",Phys Eng Sci Med,,359
384471,Secondary infection rates and antibiotic prescribing in a COVID-19 hdu population,2021,"BACKGROUND: The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a potential threat to patients with autoimmune disorders, including multiple sclerosis (MS) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). Such patients are usually treated with immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive agents, which may tamper with the organism's normal response to infections. Currently, no consensus has been reached on how to manage MS and NMOSD patients during the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To discuss strategies to manage those patients. METHODS: We focus on how to 1) reduce COVID-19 infection risk, such as social distancing, telemedicine, and wider interval between laboratory testing/imaging; 2) manage relapses, such as avoiding treatment of mild relapse and using oral steroids; 3) manage disease-modifying therapies, such as preference for drugs associated with lower infection risk (interferons, glatiramer, teriflunomide, and natalizumab) and extended-interval dosing of natalizumab, when safe; 4) individualize the chosen MS induction-therapy (anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, alemtuzumab, and cladribine); 5) manage NMOSD preventive therapies, including initial therapy selection and current treatment maintenance; 6) manage MS/NMOSD patients infected with COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: In the future, real-world case series of MS/NMOSD patients infected with COVID-19 will help us define the best management strategies. For the time being, we rely on expert experience and guidance.","ApÓstolos-Pereira, Samira Luisa; Silva, Guilherme Diogo; Disserol, Caio César Diniz; Feo, Lucas Bueno; Matos, Aline de Moura Brasil; Schoeps, Vinicius Andreoli; Gomes, Ana Beatriz Ayroza Galvão Ribeiro; Boaventura, Mateus; Mendes, Maria Fernanda; Callegaro, Dagoberto",Arq Neuropsiquiatr,,359
384472,Secondary infection rates and antibiotic prescribing in a COVID-19 hdu population,2021,"Short single-stranded nucleic acids as found in a variety of bodily fluids have recently emerged as minimally invasive biomarkers for a broad range of pathologies, most notably cancer. Because of their small size, low natural abundance and high sequence homology between family members they are challenging to detect using standard technologies suitable for use at the point-of-care. Herein we report the design, engineering and testing of a novel sensing strategy: electrochemically active molecular probes based on peptide nucleic acid (PNA) scaffolds for the detection of single-stranded oligonucleotides, in particular microRNAs (or miRs). As a proof-of-principle, a wide range of probes were designed and tested to detect miR-141, a known diagnostic biomarker for prostate cancer. Optimal quantitative sensing of miR-141 was achieved via the first example of an electrochemical oligonucleotide-templated reaction (EOTR), whereby two PNA probes - functionalized with an aniline and a 1,4-catechol respectively - preferentially react with each other upon simultaneous hybridization to the same RNA target strand, serving here as a template. Quantitative, electrochemical detection of the product of this bio-orthogonal reaction showed direct correlation between adduct formation and miR-141 concentration. Coupling the specificity of OTR with the speed and sensitivity of electrochemical sensing delivers EOTRs as a promising new technique for fast, low-cost, quantitative and sequence-specific detection of short nucleic acids from liquid biopsies.","Gillespie, Philip; Channon, Robert B; Meng, Xiaotong; Islam, Md Nazmul; Ladame, Sylvain; O039,; Hare, Danny",Biosens Bioelectron,,359

It has been a provocative challenge for modern medicine to diagnose CVD in its crib, owing to its etiological factors being attributed to a large array of systemic diseases, as well as its non-binary hideous nature that gradually leads to functional disability. Novel echocardiography techniques have enabled the cardiac ultrasound to provide a comprehensive analysis of the heart in an objective, feasible, time- and cost-effective manner. Speckle tracking echocardiography, contrast echocardiography, and 3D echocardiography have shown the highest potential for widespread use. The uses of novel modalities have been elaborately demonstrated in this study as a proof of concept that echocardiography has a place in routine general practice with supportive evidence being as recent as its role in the concurrent COVID-19 pandemic. Despite such evidence, many uses remain off-label and unexploited in practice. Generalization of echocardiography at the point of care can become a much-needed turning point in the clinical approach to case management. To actualize such aspirations, we recommend further prospective and interventional studies to examine the effect of implementing advanced techniques at the point of care on the decision-making process and evaluate their effectiveness in prevention of cardiovascular morbidities and mortalities.","Iskander, John; Kelada, Peter; Rashad, Lara; Massoud, Doaa; Afdal, Peter; Abdelmassih, Antoine Fakhry",Curr Probl Cardiol,,359

387647,[Olfactory dysfunction and COVID-19 - current state of the problem],2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Approximately 15% of severe cases require an intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mechanical ventilation due to development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Tetracyclines (TCs) are a group of bacteriostatic antibiotics, like tetracycline, minocycline, and doxycycline, effective against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria as well as Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Based on available evidences, TCs may be effective against coronaviruses and thus useful to treat COVID-19. Thus, this review aims to provide a brief overview on the uses of TCs for COVID-19 management. SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses depend mainly on the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) for their proliferation, cell adhesion, and infiltration. The anti-inflammatory mechanisms of TCs are linked to different pathways. Briefly, TCs inhibit mitochondrial cytochrome c and caspase pathway with improvement of lymphopenia in early COVID-19. Specifically, minocycline is effective in reducing COVID-19-related complications, through attenuation of cytokine storm as apparent by reduction of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Different clinical trials recommend the replacement of azithromycin by minocycline in the management of COVID-19 patients at high risk due to two main reasons: 1) minocycline does not prolong the QT interval and even inhibits ischemia-induced arrhythmia;2) minocycline displays synergistic effect with chloroquine against SARS-CoV-2. Taken together, the data presented here show that TCs, mainly doxycycline or minocycline, may be potential partners in COVID-19 management, derived pneumonia, and related complications, such as acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS.","Al-Kuraishy, H.

Herein we extend this concept to the field of noble metal nanocrystals and report the solution synthesis of metastable face-centered tetragonal Au that has not been discovered before. The successful synthesis relies on the formation of intermetallic AuCu3@Au core-shell structure, where the interface strain stabilizes the metastable fct Au overlayer. Compared with the face-centered cubic Au counterpart, the metastable fct Au shows greatly improved catalytic activity toward CO2 reduction to CO. The density functional theory calculations and spectroscopic studies reveal that the metastable fct Au upshifts the d-band center, which lowers the energy barrier of key intermediate COOH* formation and thus facilitates the reaction kinetics.","Yu, Dan; Gao, Lei; Sun, Tulai; Guo, Jingchun; Yuan, Yuliang; Zhang, Jiawei; Li, Mengfan; Li, Xingxing; Liu, Maochang; Ma, Chao; Liu, Qinghua; Pan, Anlian; Yang, Jinlong; Huang, Hongwen",Nano lett,,359

RESULTS: There were no differences between the SARS-CoV-2-positive cohort without hyposmia and negative controls in terms of BSIT (8.5 ± 2.6 vs. 10.2 ± 1.8), TS (3.4 ± 0.6 vs. 3.9 ± 0.3) or VAS (2.1 ± 1.3 vs. 1.1 ± 0.5); yet the SNOT-22 was significantly elevated (27.7 ± 11.2 vs. 16.4 ± 10.8). The SARS-CoV-2-positive group with hyposmia performed significantly poorer in BSIT (4.0 ± 1.7 vs. 8.5 ± 2.6/10.2 ± 1.8), TS (2.6 ± 1.3 vs. 3.4 ± 0.6/3.9 ± 0.3), and VAS (7.9 ± 2.2 vs. 2.1 ± 1.3/1.1 ± 0.5) compared to both control groups. At week 8 and month 6 control, six and five patients, respectively, still suffered from subjectively and objectively impaired chemosensory function. The other patients had recovered in both respects. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 patients with subjectively impaired chemosensory function regularly perform poorly in objective measurements. About 70% of patients suffering from olfactory dysfunction in SARS-CoV-2 quickly recover-the rest still suffers from considerable impairment 6 months after infection.","Bertlich, Mattis; Stihl, Clemens; Lüsebrink, Enzo; Hellmuth, Johannes C; Scherer, Clemens; Freytag, Saskia; Spiegel, Jennifer Lee; Stoycheva, Ivelina; Canis, Martin; Weiss, Bernhard G; Ihler, Friedrich; Haubner, Frank",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,359

By 31 May 2020, 514,200 COVID-19 cases, including 29,314 deaths, had been reported in 75.3% (4,196 of 5,570) of municipalities across all five administrative regions of Brazil. The R0 value for Brazil was estimated at 3.1 (95% Bayesian credible interval = 2.4-5.5), with a higher median but overlapping credible intervals compared with some other seriously affected countries. A positive association between higher per-capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. Furthermore, the severe acute respiratory infection cases with unknown aetiology were associated with lower per-capita income. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses was detected but at very low levels. These findings provide a comprehensive description of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil and may help to guide subsequent measures to control virus transmission.","de Souza, William Marciel; Buss, Lewis Fletcher; Candido, Darlan da Silva; Carrera, Jean-Paul; Li, Sabrina; Zarebski, Alexander E; Pereira, Rafael Henrique Moraes; Prete, Carlos A; de Souza-Santos, Andreza Aruska; Parag, Kris V; Belotti, Maria Carolina T D; Vincenti-Gonzalez, Maria F; Messina, Janey; da Silva Sales, Flavia Cristina; Andrade, Pamela Dos Santos; Nascimento, Vítor Heloiz; Ghilardi, Fabio; Abade, Leandro; Gutierrez, Bernardo; Kraemer, Moritz U G; Braga, Carlos K V; Aguiar, Renato Santana; Alexander, Neal; Mayaud, Philippe; Brady, Oliver J; Marcilio, Izabel; Gouveia, Nelson; Li, Guangdi; Tami, Adriana; de Oliveira, Silvano Barbosa; Porto, Victor Bertollo Gomes; Ganem, Fabiana; de Almeida, Walquiria Aparecida Ferreira; Fantinato, Francieli Fontana Sutile Tardetti; Macário, Eduardo Marques; de Oliveira, Wanderson Kleber; Nogueira, Mauricio L; Pybus, Oliver G; Wu, Chieh-Hsi; Croda, Julio; Sabino, Ester C; Faria, Nuno Rodrigues",Nat Hum Behav,,359

391096,Covid-19 Infections in the Eosinophilic Gi Disease Population Are Not Severe: Initial Report from a Global Online Registry,2021,"BACKGROUND: Endpoint choice for randomized controlled trials of treatments for novel coronavirus-induced disease (COVID-19) is complex. Trials must start rapidly to identify treatments that can be used as part of the outbreak response, in the midst of considerable uncertainty and limited information. COVID-19 presentation is heterogeneous, ranging from mild disease that improves within days to critical disease that can last weeks to over a month and can end in death. While improvement in mortality would provide unquestionable evidence about the clinical significance of a treatment, sample sizes for a study evaluating mortality are large and may be impractical, particularly given a multitude of putative therapies to evaluate. Furthermore, patient states in between ""cure"" and ""death"" represent meaningful distinctions. Clinical severity scores have been proposed as an alternative. However, the appropriate summary measure for severity scores has been the subject of debate, particularly given the variable time course of COVID-19. Outcomes measured at fixed time points, such as a comparison of severity scores between treatment and control at day 14, may risk missing the time of clinical benefit. An endpoint such as time to improvement (or recovery) avoids the timing problem. However, some have argued that power losses will result from reducing the ordinal scale to a binary state of ""recovered"" versus ""not recovered."" METHODS: We evaluate statistical power for possible trial endpoints for COVID-19 treatment trials using simulation models and data from two recent COVID-19 treatment trials. RESULTS: Power for fixed time-point methods depends heavily on the time selected for evaluation. Time-to-event approaches have reasonable statistical power, even when compared with a fixed time-point method evaluated at the optimal time. DISCUSSION: Time-to-event analysis methods have advantages in the COVID-19 setting, unless the optimal time for evaluating treatment effect is known in advance. Even when the optimal time is known, a time-to-event approach may increase power for interim analyses.","Dodd, Lori E; Follmann, Dean; Wang, Jing; Koenig, Franz; Korn, Lisa L; Schoergenhofer, Christian; Proschan, Michael; Hunsberger, Sally; Bonnett, Tyler; Makowski, Mat; Belhadi, Drifa; Wang, Yeming; Cao, Bin; Mentre, France; Jaki, Thomas",Clin Trials,,359
391675,Vascular Manifestations in COVID 19,2021,"In three-dimensional domain swapping, two protein monomers exchange a part of their structures to form an intertwined homodimer, whose subunits resemble the monomer. Several viral proteins domain swap to increase their structural complexity or functional avidity. The main protease (Mpro) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus proteolyzes viral polyproteins and has been a target for anti-SARS drug design. Domain swapping in the &#945;-helical C-terminal domain of Mpro (MproC) locks Mpro into a hyperactive octameric form that is hypothesized to promote the early stages of viral replication. However, in the absence of a complete molecular understanding of the mechanism of domain swapping, investigations into the biological relevance of this octameric Mpro have stalled. Isolated MproC can exist as a monomer or a domain-swapped dimer. Here, we investigate the mechanism of domain swapping of MproC using coarse-grained structure-based models and molecular dynamics simulations. Our simulations recapitulate several experimental features of MproC folding. Further, we find that a contact between a tryptophan in the MproC domain-swapping hinge and an arginine elsewhere forms early during folding, modulates the folding route, and promotes domain swapping to the native structure. An examination of the sequence and the structure of the tryptophan containing hinge loop shows that it has a propensity to form multiple secondary structures and contacts, indicating that it could be stabilized into either the monomer- or dimer-promoting conformations by mutations or ligand binding. Finally, because all residues in the tryptophan loop are identical in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, mutations that modulate domain swapping may provide insights into the role of octameric Mpro in the early-stage viral replication of both viruses.","Terse, Vishram L; Gosavi, Shachi",Biophys J,,359

The fundamental question, how the brain adapts to periods of sensory deprivation and re-adapts to normality, has only received little attention. Here, we use eyes closed and eyes open resting-state electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings to investigate how neural activity is altered during 120 days of isolation in a spatially confined, space-analogue environment. After disentangling oscillatory patterns from 1/f activity, we show that isolation leads to a reduction in broadband power and a flattening of the 1/f spectral slope. Beyond that, we observed a reduction in alpha peak frequency during isolation, but did not find strong evidence for isolation-induced changes that are of oscillatory nature. Critically, all effects reversed upon release from isolation. These findings suggest that isolation and concomitant sensory deprivation lead to an enhanced cortical deactivation which might be explained by a reduction in the mean neuronal population firing rate.","Weber, Jan; Klein, Timo; Abeln, Vera",Sci Rep,,359

However, further studies are needed to assess these beliefs during the COVID-19 pandemic. AIMS: To evaluate the use of R/S during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil and to investigate the association between R/S and the mental health consequences of social isolation. METHODS: Cross-sectional study conducted in May 2020. Online surveys were carried out assessing sociodemographics, R/S measures, and social isolation characteristics and mental health consequences (hopefulness, fear, worrying and sadness). Adjusted regression models were used. RESULTS: A total of 485 participants were included from all regions of Brazil. There was a high use of religious and spiritual beliefs during the pandemic and this use was associated with better mental health outcomes. Lower levels of worrying were associated with greater private religious activities (OR = 0.466, CI 95%: 0.307-0.706), religious attendance (OR = 0.587, CI 95%: 0.395-0.871), spiritual growth (OR = 0.667, CI 95%: 0.448-0.993) and with an increase in religious activities (OR = 0.660, CI 95%: 0.442-0.986); lower levels of fear were associated with greater private religious activities (OR = 0.632, CI 95%: 0.422-0.949) and spiritual growth (OR = 0.588, CI 95%: 0.392-0.882) and, lower levels of sadness (OR = 0.646, CI 95%: 0.418-0.997) were associated with spiritual growth. Finally, hope was associated with all R/S variables in different degrees (ranging from OR = 1.706 to 3.615). CONCLUSIONS: R/S seem to have an important role on the relief of suffering, having an influence on health outcomes and minimizing the consequences of social isolation. These results highlight the importance of public health measures that ensure the continuity of R/S activities during the pandemic and the training of healthcare professionals to address these issues.","Lucchetti, Giancarlo; Góes, Leonardo Garcia; Amaral, Stefani Garbulio; Ganadjian, Gabriela Terzian; Andrade, Isabelle; Almeida, Paulo Othávio de Araújo; do Carmo, Victor Mendes; Manso, Maria Elisa Gonzalez",Int J Soc Psychiatry,,359

Treatment in this subpopulation is complex due to the potential hepatotoxicity of some of the medicinal products used. Moreover, the pandemic has also negatively impacted patients with liver disease who have not contracted COVID-19, since the reallocation of human and material resources to the care of patients with the virus has resulted in a decrease in the treatment, diagnosis and follow-up of patients with liver disease, which will surely have negative consequences in the near future.

Given their use in over 180 countries, such data is of upmost importance to inform policy on optimal vaccination strategies. This study compares the immunogenicity of BNT162b2 with ChAdOx1 in patients receiving haemodialysis. Methods1021 patients were screened for spike protein antibodies (anti-S) following 2 doses of either BNT162b2 (n=523) or ChAdOx1 (n=498). 191 patients underwent assessment with T-cell ELISpot assays. 65 health care workers were used as a control group. ResultsAnti-S was detected in 936 (91.2%) of patients post-vaccination. There was no difference in seroconversion rates between infection-naive patients who received BNT162b2, 248/281 (88.3%), compared with ChAdOx1, 227/272 (83.5%), p=0.11. Anti-S concentrations were higher following BNT162b, 462(152-1171) BAU/ml, compared with ChAdOx-1 79(20-213) BAU/ml, p<0.0001. Immunosuppression was associated with failure to seroconvert (p<0.0001); whilst being active on the transplant wait list was a predictor for seroconversion (p=0.02). Only 73 (38.2%) of patients had detectable T-cell responses post-vaccination, with no proportional difference between infection-naive patients who received BNT162b2, 2/19 (10.5%), versus ChAdOx1, 15/75 (20.0%), p=0.34. There were no quantitative differences in T-cell responses in infection-naive patients, with a median 2(0-16) SFU/106 PBMCs and 10(4-28) SFU/106 PBMCs in those receiving BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 respectively, p=0.35. These responses were significantly weaker compared with healthy controls. ConclusionsEnhanced immunogenicity was seen with BNT162b2 compared with ChAdOx1, driven by superior humoral responses, with attenuated T-cell responses to both vaccines. Comparative data on clinical efficacy is now required. Significance StatementLimited data exist on the immunogenicity of vector-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in patients with kidney disease.

This study compares the immunogenicity of BNT162b2 (n=523) against the adenovirus vector vaccine, ChAdOx1 (n=498), in 1021 haemodialysis patients. In infection-naive patients, overall seroconversion rates were comparable, however, spike protein antibody concentrations were significantly higher following BNT162b2. No difference in T-cell responses was seen, however, all naive patients had weaker responses compared with healthy controls. Equivalent attenuated cellular responses to both vaccines, with greater humoral responses to BNT162b2, suggests BNT162b2 has superior immunogenicity in this patient population, with data on clinical efficacy required.","Clarke, Candice L; Martin, Paul; Gleeson, Sarah; Thomson, Tina; Edwards, Helena; Mortimer, Paige; McIntyre, Stacey; Deborah, Jaid; Cox, Alison; Pickard, Graham; Lightstone, Liz; Thomas, David; McAdoo, Stephen P; Kelleher, Peter; Prendecki, Maria; Willicombe, Michelle; Consortium, - OCTAVE Study",,,359

As there is a current lack of approved treatments and vaccines, universal safety precautions (USPs) must be taken to deal with this emergency. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge and beliefs of the Indian public with regard to USPs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based survey was conducted during March 2020. A 20-item self-administered questionnaire was developed, validated and distributed using Google Forms through social media networks. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors influencing knowledge regarding COVID-19 USPs. Results: Of the 1117 individuals who participated in the survey, the mean age was 28.8 ± 10.9 years, 32.9% had a post-graduate education, 45% had a professional job, and 40% belonged to the upper-middle economic class. Overall, the mean correct response scores were 63% for USP knowledge and 83% for USP beliefs. All the sociodemographic variables were significantly (p < 0.001) associated with the USP knowledge levels. Importantly, students were less likely to have a lower level of USP knowledge compared with the other occupations (odds ratio 0.35, 95% CI 0.23-0.53; p < 0.001). Conclusion: Although the knowledge and beliefs of the Indian public towards USPs are encouraging, there is a need for long-term educational interventions as the dynamics and severity of COVID-19 rapidly change. These findings could guide public health authorities to make and implement precautionary measures to combat this pandemic.","Gudi, Sai Krishna; Chhabra, Manik; Undela, Krishna; Venkataraman, Rajesh; Mateti, Uday Venkat; Tiwari, Komal Krishna; Nyamagoud, Sanath",Drugs Ther Perspect,,359

The sample size was made up 4355 participants, including 70 COVID-19-infected students. We found that during the COVID-19 outbreak in early 2020, college students in Wuhan were primarily infected during off-campus events after winter break or infected in their hometowns after leaving Wuhan; the percentage of college students with severe cases was relatively low, and most had mild cases; however, a large proportion of asymptomatic cases may exist; there were significant group differences in gender, age and place of residence; and the risk of infection was closely related to the campus environment, in which the population density and number of faculty and students on campus had a significant impact. The results indicated that the infection of students did not occur at random, thus strengthening student health education and campus management can help curb the spread of COVID-19 among students.","Fan, Changyu; Li, Min; Li, Xueyan; Zhu, Miao; Fu, Ping",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,359

395867,eP466 - The impact of COVID-19 on pediatric diagnostic odysseys,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease characterized by strong induction of inflammatory cytokines, progressive lung inflammation and potentially multi-organ dysfunction. It remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 is sensed by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) leading to immune activation. Several studies suggest that the Spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2 might interact with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and thereby activate immunity. Here we have investigated the role of TLR4 in SARS-CoV-2 infection and immunity. Neither exposure of isolated S protein, SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus nor a primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate induced TLR4 activation in a TLR4-expressing cell line. Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) express TLR4 but not ACE2, and DCs were not infected by a primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate. Notably, neither S protein nor the primary SARS-CoV-2 isolate induced DC maturation or cytokines, indicating that both S protein and SARS-CoV-2 virus particles do not trigger extracellular TLRs, including TLR4. Ectopic expression of ACE2 in DCs led to efficient infection by SARS-CoV-2. Strikingly, infection of ACE2-positive DCs induced type I IFN and cytokine responses, which was inhibited by antibodies against ACE2. These data strongly suggest that not extracellular TLRs but intracellular viral sensors are key players in sensing SARS-CoV-2. These data imply that SARS-CoV-2 escapes direct sensing by TLRs, which might underlie the lack of efficient immunity to SARS-CoV-2 early during infection. Author summaryThe immune system needs to recognize pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 to initiate antiviral immunity. Dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial for inducing antiviral immunity and are therefore equipped with both extracellular and intracellular pattern recognition receptors to sense pathogens. However, it is unknown if and how SARS-CoV-2 activates DCs. Recent research suggests that SARS-CoV-2 is sensed by extracellular Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). We have previously shown that DCs do not express ACE2, and are therefore not infected by SARS-CoV-2. Here we show that DCs do not become activated by exposure to viral Spike proteins or SARS-CoV-2 virus particles. These findings suggest that TLR4 and other extracellular TLRs do not sense SARS-CoV-2. Next, we expressed ACE2 in DCs and SARS-CoV-2 efficiently infected these ACE2-positive DCs. Notably, infection of ACE2-positive DCs induced an antiviral immune response. Thus, our study suggests that infection of DCs is required for induction of immunity, and thus that intracellular viral sensors rather than extracellular TLRs are important in sensing SARS-CoV-2. Lack of sensing by extracellular TLRs might be an escape mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 and could contribute to the aberrant immune responses observed during COVID-19.","Donk, Lieve E.H. van der; Eder, Julia; Hamme, John L. van; Brouwer, Philip J.M.; Brinkkemper, Mitch; Nuenen, Ad C. van; Gils, Marit J. van; Sanders, Rogier W.; Kootstra, Neeltje A.; Bermejo-Jambrina, Marta; Geijtenbeek, Teunis B.H.",,,359

The mean follow-up was 46.8 months. RESULTS: All patients were alive at the last follow-up. There was no graft fracture, hardware failure, or infection. The mean time of osseous union was 2.9 months at fibula-humerus junction and 6.2 months at allograft-humerus junction. Hypertrophy and axial growth were evident in all, except one patient who has avascular necrosis of the fibula head. The mean hypertrophy index was 51.5%, and the mean growth was 4.4 mm per annum. The mean arm discrepancy was 4.6 cm. All reconstruction was in situ with the average abduction of 113° and forward flexion of 69°. The mean Musculoskeletal Tumor Society (MSTS) score was 85.4% at the final follow-up. All patients experienced dropped foot and resolved spontaneously. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of vascularized fibula epiphyseal transfer with massive allograft bone provides a reliable oncologic reconstruction of proximal humerus in children. It not only offers the ability of longitudinal growth, hypertrophy, and osseous union but also diminishes reconstructive complications and improves shoulder function.

Leaders participating in a survey rated the effectiveness of their department's capabilities and capacities in administrative and public health preparedness, epidemiology, and communications on a scale from 1 to 5; those partaking in focus groups answered open-ended questions about the same 4 topics. Subjects rated intragovernmental activities most effective ( = 4.41, SD = 0.83) and reported receiving assistance from other county agencies. They rated level of supplies least effective ( = 3.03, SD = 1.01), describing low supply levels and inequitable distribution of testing materials and personal protective equipment among regions. Local health departments in New York require more state and federal aid to maintain the public health workforce in preparation for future emergencies.","Ravenhall, Sarah; Levy, Nicole A; Simpson, Kathryn; Fleming, Molly; Arana, Mayela; DiManno, Peggy; Grijalva, Yesenia; Murrman, Marita K",J Public Health Manag Pract,,359
396670,"COVID-19 and Hypercoagulability: Potential Impact on Management with Oral Contraceptives, Estrogen Therapy and Pregnancy",2020,"One of the most important branches of nonlinear control theory is the so-called sliding-mode. Its aim is the design of a (nonlinear) feedback law that brings and maintains the state trajectory of a dynamic system on a given sliding surface. Here, dynamics becomes completely independent of the model parameters and can be tuned accordingly to the desired target. In this paper we study this problem when the feedback law is subject to strong structural constraints. In particular, we assume that the control input may take values only over two bounded and disjoint sets. Such sets could be also non perfectly known a priori. An example is a control input allowed to switch only between two values. Under these peculiarities, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions that guarantee sliding-mode control effectiveness for a class of time-varying continuous-time linear systems that includes all the stationary state-space linear models. Our analysis covers several scientific fields. It is only apparently confined to the linear setting and allows also to study an important set of nonlinear models. We describe fundamental examples related to epidemiology where the control input is the level of contact rate among people and the sliding surface permits to control the number of infected. For popular epidemiological models we prove the global convergence of control schemes based on the introduction of severe restrictions, like lockdowns, to contain epidemic. This greatly generalizes previous results obtained in the literature by casting them within a general sliding-mode theory.","Bisiacco, Mauro; Pillonetto, Gianluigi",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.05464v1.pdf,359

397849,"Covid-19: 700 000 patients could be left unable to see a GP face to face, charity warns",2020,"OBJECTIVES: In the midst of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak, chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is playing an important role in diagnosis and monitoring of patients with COVID-19. We propose a deep learning model for detection of COVID-19 from CXRs, as well as a tool for retrieving similar patients according to the model's results on their CXRs. For training and evaluating our model, we collected CXRs from inpatients hospitalized in four different hospitals. METHODS: In this retrospective study, 1384 frontal CXRs, of COVID-19 confirmed patients imaged between March and August 2020, and 1024 matching CXRs of non-COVID patients imaged before the pandemic, were collected and used to build a deep learning classifier for detecting patients positive for COVID-19. The classifier consists of an ensemble of pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNS), specifically, ReNet34, ReNet50¸ ReNet152, and vgg16, and is enhanced by data augmentation and lung segmentation. We further implemented a nearest-neighbors algorithm that uses DNN-based image embeddings to retrieve the images most similar to a given image. RESULTS: Our model achieved accuracy of 90.3%, (95% CI: 86.3-93.7%) specificity of 90% (95% CI: 84.3-94%), and sensitivity of 90.5% (95% CI: 85-94%) on a test dataset comprising 15% (350/2326) of the original images. The AUC of the ROC curve is 0.96 (95% CI: 0.93-0.97). CONCLUSION: We provide deep learning models, trained and evaluated on CXRs that can assist medical efforts and reduce medical staff workload in handling COVID-19. KEY POINTS: â¢ A machine learning model was able to detect chest X-ray (CXR) images of patients tested positive for COVID-19 with accuracy and detection rate above 90%. â¢ A tool was created for finding existing CXR images with imaging characteristics most similar to a given CXR, according to the model's image embeddings.","Keidar, Daphna; Yaron, Daniel; Goldstein, Elisha; Shachar, Yair; Blass, Ayelet; Charbinsky, Leonid; Aharony, Israel; Lifshitz, Liza; Lumelsky, Dimitri; Neeman, Ziv; Mizrachi, Matti; Hajouj, Majd; Eizenbach, Nethanel; Sela, Eyal; Weiss, Chedva S; Levin, Philip; Benjaminov, Ofer; Bachar, Gil N; Tamir, Shlomit; Rapson, Yael; Suhami, Dror; Atar, Eli; Dror, Amiel A; Bogot, Naama R; Grubstein, Ahuva; Shabshin, Nogah; Elyada, Yishai M; Eldar, Yonina C",Eur. radiol,,359

Materials and methods: The thirty-four cases, 15 females and 19 males, with an age ranging from 7 to 88 years old, confirmed by real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), were used for our study. All thin-section CT scans of the lungs were performed in all of patients. The clinical, laboratory and CT imaging were available to evaluate in all patients. Results: The patients present with fever (85.29%, n = 29), cough (67.65%, n = 23), fatigue or myalgia (26.47%, n = 9), and pharyngalgia (8.82%, n = 3). The 4 patients (11.76%) with no symptoms were identified during screening for close contacts, who had typical CT findings. On initial CT scans, the bilateral lung involved was shown in 24 cases (70.59%), while 29 (82.35%) cases were distributed in peripheral. The pure ground glass opacity (GGO) was shown in 18 cases (52.94%), the GGO with consolidation was in 12 cases (35.29%), and full consolidation only in 3 cases. The lesion with air bronchogram was seen in 14 (41.18%) cases, with enlarged blood vessel in 17 (50.00%) cases, with crazy-paving pattern in 8 (23.53%) cases, with fine reticular pattern in 4 (11.77%) cases, and with intralesional vacuole sign in 6 (17.65%) cases. The pleural effusion was seen in one patient. Follow-up imaging in 19 patients during the study time window demonstrated mild, moderate or severe progression of disease, as manifested by increasing extent and density of lung opacities. Conclusions: The bilateral GGO with air bronchogram, enlarged blood vessel, fine reticular pattern, and peripheral distribution are the early CT findings of COVID-19. The crazy-paving pattern and intralesional vacuole sign are the features of progressive stage.","Zhang, Litao; Kong, Xue; Li, Xiujuan; Zhu, Jianzhong; Liu, Shanping; Li, Weiwei; Xu, Chunlin; Du, Huanwang; Jing, Hui; Xu, Jiahuan; Shi, Tongtong; Xie, Yuanzhong",Clin Imaging,,359

The current study was undertaken to determine the clinically relevant 95% effective dose of intrathecal 2% hyperbaric prilocaine co-administered with sufentanil for scheduled cesarean section, using continual reassessment method. METHODS: We conducted a dose-response, prospective, double-blinded study to determine the ED95 values of intrathecal hyperbaric prilocaine used with 2,5 mcg of sufentanil and 100 mcg of morphine for cesarean delivery. Each parturient enrolled in the study received an intrathecal dose of hyperbaric prilocaine determined by the CRM and the success or failure of the block was assessed as being the primary endpoint. RESULTS: The doses given for each cohort varied from 35 to 50 mg of HP, according to the CRM, with a final ED95 lying between 45 and 50 mg of Prilocaine after completion of the 10 cohorts. Few side effects were reported and patients were globally satisfied. CONCLUSIONS: The ED95 of intrathecal hyperbaric prilocaine with sufentanil 2.5 µg and morphine 100 µg for elective cesarean delivery was found to be between 45 and 50 mg. It may be an interesting alternative to other long-lasting local anesthetics in this context.

Although a recent report indicated favorable responses to the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra in eight patients with COVID-19 secondary HLH diagnosed using the HScore calculation, others have suggested that the diagnosis of secondary HLH is uncommon and that the use of the HScore has limited value in guiding immunomodulatory therapy for COVID-19. Here, we provide additional perspective on this important controversy based upon comparisons between 14 COVID-19 cytokine storm patients and 10 secondary HLH patients seen immediately prior to the pandemic. We hypothesize that identification of HLH may relate to the severity or timing of cytokine release and suggest distinguishing between cytokine release syndrome and secondary HLH, reserving the latter term for cases fulfilling diagnostic criteria.","Hakim, Nausheen N; Chi, Jeffrey; Olazagasti, Coral; Liu, Johnson M",Exp Biol Med (Maywood),,359

The PQ symmetry is a remnant of the $B-L$ gauge symmetry at the renormalizable level. Besides, the sufficient quality of the PQ symmetry is preserved by a non anomalous discrete gauged $R$-symmetry and a small gravitino mass $m_{3/2}\ll 100$GeV. A viable mass range is $m_{3/2}=\mathcal{O}(1)$eV which allows a high reheating temperature and many baryogenesis scenarios typified by the thermal leptogenesis without any astrophysical and cosmological problems.

Stem/progenitor cell hierarchy in the stomach is complex, which include the Lgr5(+) gastric stem cells (GSCs). METHODS: While previous studies have focused on non-nuclear Lgr5 expression, nuclear Lgr5 expression has been reported in a subset of stem cells, and we examined nuclear Lgr5 expression in a local cohort of 95 cases of gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma. mRNA levels for LGR5 and other stem cell marker genes were examined in the TCGA cohort. RESULTS: We observed nuclear Lgr5 expression in a 18/95 cases. Near mutual exclusivity was seen between nuclear Lgr5 and strong non-nuclear Lgr5. Both strong non-nuclear and nuclear Lgr5 expression tended to be seen more frequently with the intestinal histotype and approximated CIN molecular subtype. With respect to overall survival (OS), nuclear Lgr5 expression appears to be protective, with the worst survival being seen in the cases lacking nuclear Lgr5 and with low non-nuclear Lgr5 expression. When compared to other stem/progenitor cell markers, LGR5 mRNA expression clusters with other GSC marker genes, including VIL1. Higher expression of these GSC marker genes was associated with better OS. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that Lgr5 expression is dynamic in gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma and heterogeneous across the several disease attributes. We postulate that this may reflect ""retained stemness"" in the form of Lgr5High-GSC signature that appears to be associated with better survival.","Yoon, Ju-Yoon; Brezden-Masley, Christine; Streutker, Catherine J",BMC Cancer,,359

Within this framework, it is crucial to ensure no disruption to essential oncological services and guarantee the optimal care.This is a structured proposal for the management of lung cancer, comprising three levels of priorities, namely: tier 1 (high priority), tier 2 (medium priority) and tier 3 (low priority)-defined according to the criteria of the Cancer Care Ontario, Huntsman Cancer Institute and Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale.The manuscript emphasises the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on lung cancer care and reconsiders all steps from diagnosis, staging and treatment.These recommendations should, therefore, serve as guidance for prioritising the different aspects of cancer care to mitigate the possible negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the management of our patients.As the situation is rapidly evolving, practical actions are required to guarantee the best patients' treatment while protecting and respecting their rights, safety and well-being. In this environment, cancer practitioners have great responsibilities: provide timely, appropriate, compassionate and justified cancer care, while protecting themselves and their patients from being infected with COVID-19. In case of shortages, resources must be distributed fairly. Consequently, the following recommendations can be applied with significant nuances, depending on the time and location for their use, considering variable constraints imposed to the health systems.

The dynamics detected in STEMI (within a few hours) were replicated in COVID-19 (within a few days). In both entities patients with events and with severe structural damage displayed higher neutrophil and lower lymphocyte counts. In both scenarios, higher maximum neutrophil and lower minimum lymphocyte counts were associated with more events and more severe organ damage. NLR was higher in STEMI and COVID-19 patients with the worst clinical and structural outcomes. A canonical deregulation of the immune response occurs in STEMI and COVID-19 patients.

Although little is known about the virus, an examination of the genome sequence shows strong homology with its better-studied cousin, SARS-CoV. The spike protein used for host cell infection shows key nonsynonymous mutations that might hamper the efficacy of previously developed therapeutics but remains a viable target for the development of biologics and macrocyclic peptides. Other key drug targets, including RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and coronavirus main proteinase (3CLpro), share a strikingly high (>95 %) homology to SARS-CoV. Herein, we suggest four potential drug candidates (an ACE2-based peptide, remdesivir, 3CLpro-1 and a novel vinylsulfone protease inhibitor) that could be used to treat patients suffering with the 2019-nCoV. We also summarize previous efforts into drugging these targets and hope to help in the development of broad-spectrum anti-coronaviral agents for future epidemics.","Morse, Jared S; Lalonde, Tyler; Xu, Shiqing; Liu, Wenshe Ray",Chembiochem,,359
405133,Multiple sclerosis in the COVID-19 era: Vocational rehabilitation strategies to meet the needs of a growing and immune-vulnerable clientele,2021,"BACKGROUND: Strict social distancing measures owing to the COVID-19 pandemic have led people to rely more heavily on social media, such as Facebook groups, as a means of communication and information sharing. Multiple Facebook groups have been formed by medical professionals, laypeople, and engineering or technical groups to discuss current issues and possible solutions to the current medical crisis. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to characterize Facebook groups formed by laypersons, medical professionals, and technical professionals, with specific focus on information dissemination and requests for crowdsourcing. METHODS: Facebook was queried for user-created groups with the keywords ""COVID,"" ""Coronavirus,"" and ""SARS-CoV-2"" at a single time point on March 31, 2020. The characteristics of each group were recorded, including language, privacy settings, security requirements to attain membership, and membership type. For each membership type, the group with the greatest number of members was selected, and in each of these groups, the top 100 posts were identified using Facebook's algorithm. Each post was categorized and characterized (evidence-based, crowd-sourced, and whether the poster self-identified). STATA (version 13 SE, Stata Corp) was used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: Our search yielded 257 COVID-19-related Facebook groups. Majority of the groups (n=229, 89%) were for laypersons, 26 (10%) were for medical professionals, and only 2 (1%) were for technical professionals. The number of members was significantly greater in medical groups (21,215, SD 35,040) than in layperson groups (7623, SD 19,480) (P&lt;.01). Medical groups were significantly more likely to require security checks to attain membership (81% vs 43%;P&lt;.001) and less likely to be public (3 vs 123;P&lt;.001) than layperson groups. Medical groups had the highest user engagement, averaging 502 (SD 633) reactions (P&lt;.01) and 224 (SD 311) comments (P&lt;.01) per post. Medical professionals were more likely to use the Facebook groups for education and information sharing, including academic posts (P&lt;.001), idea sharing (P=.003), resource sharing (P=.02) and professional opinions (P&lt;.001), and requesting for crowdsourcing (P=.003). Layperson groups were more likely to share news (P&lt;.001), humor and motivation (P&lt;.001), and layperson opinions (P&lt;.001). There was no significant difference in the number of evidence-based posts among the groups (P=.10). CONCLUSIONS: Medical professionals utilize Facebook groups as a forum to facilitate collective intelligence (CI) and are more likely to use Facebook groups for education and information sharing, including academic posts, idea sharing, resource sharing, and professional opinions, which highlights the power of social media to facilitate CI across geographic distances. Layperson groups were more likely to share news, humor, and motivation, which suggests the utilization of Facebook groups to provide comedic relief as a coping mechanism. Further investigations are necessary to study Facebook groups' roles in facilitating CI, crowdsourcing, education, and community-building.","Xun, H.; He, W.; Chen, J.; Sylvester, S.; Lerman, S.

405293,COVID-19 corner,2020,"Microplastics or plastic particles less than 5 mm in size are a ubiquitous and damaging pollutant in the marine environment. However, the interactions between these plastic particles and marine microorganisms are just starting to be understood. The objective of this study was to measure the responses of a characteristic marine organism (Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002) to an anthropogenic stressor (polyethelene nanoparticles and microparticles) using molecular techniques. This investigation showed that polyethylene microparticles and nanoparticles have genetic, enzymatic and morphological effects on Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002. An RT-PCR analysis showed increases in the expression of esterase and hydrolase genes at 5 days of exposure to polyethylene nanoparticles and at 10 days of exposure to polyethylene microparticles. A qualitative enzymatic assay also showed esterase activity in nanoparticle exposed samples. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy was used to assess morphological changes in exopolymer formation resulting from exposure to polyethylene microparticles and nanoparticles. The data from this paper suggests that microplastic and nanoplastics could be key microbial stressors and should be investigated in further detail.","Machado, Mary C; Vimbela, Gina V; Silva-Oliveira, Tania T; Bose, Arijit; Tripathi, Anubhav",PLoS One,,359
406384,Rapidly progressive dementia in the COVID-19 era,2020,"INTRODUCTION: The COVID-19 pandemic forced the Italian government to issue extremely restrictive measures on daily activities since 11 March 2020 ('lockdown'), which may have influenced the metabolic control of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D). The aims of the study were to investigate continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) metrics in children and adults with T1D during lockdown and to identify their potentially related factors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We enrolled 130 consecutive patients with T1D (30 children (&#8804;12 years), 24 teenagers (13-17 years), and 76 adults (&#8805;18 years)) using either Dexcom or FreeStyle LibreCGM>70% during the study period, without hybrid closed-loop insulin pump. CGM metrics during the 20 days before and the 20 days after lockdown were calculated. By telephonic contact, we performed validated physical activity and perceived stress questionnaires. RESULTS: In children, significantly lower glucose SD (SDglu) (p=0.029) and time below range (TBR)<54 mg/dL (TBR2) (p=0.029) were detected after lockdown. CGM metrics were comparable in teenagers before and during lockdown. After lockdown, adults improved significantly time in range (TIR) 70-180 mg/dL (p<0.001) and remaining metrics, except percent coefficient of variation and TBR2. In adults, considering the changes in SDglu and TIR occurred before and during lockdown, we identified a group with improved TIR and SDglu who performed more physical activity, one with improved glucose variability who was younger than the other patients, and one with worsened glucose variability who showed higher perceived stress than others. CONCLUSION: In patients with T1D during lockdown, CGM metrics mostly improved in children and adults, whereas it was unchanged in teenagers. In adults, age, physical activity, and perceived stress may be relevant contributing factors.","Di Dalmazi, Guido; Maltoni, Giulio; Bongiorno, Claudio; Tucci, Lorenzo; Di Natale, Valeria; Moscatiello, Simona; Laffi, Gilberto; Pession, Andrea; Zucchini, Stefano; Pagotto, Uberto",,,359

406608,Are certain drugs associated with enhanced mortality in COVID-19?,2020,"An outbreak of new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has emerged during December 2019. The ongoing outbreak in Wuhan City spread rapidly throughout China, where the fatality rate ranged from 2.1 to 4.9%. Due to its high transmissibility, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020. The current outbreak has the potential to become the first pandemic of the new millennium. Most patients who were first diagnosed with COVID-19 worked at or lived in the vicinity of the local Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where live animals were also on sale. The concerted efforts of Chinese scientists led to the independent isolation from patients and identification of a novel coronavirus, SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), on 6 January 2020; this has been an important step in the development of treatment. The purpose of this article is to overview the history, epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID 2019 reported in recently published studies. Based on the results of virus genome sequencing and a model of the interaction between host cells and the virus, we propose several possible targets for antiviral drugs, which may provide new ideas for epidemic control and vaccine development.

406624,COVID-19 - Toward a comprehensive understanding of the disease,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic may profoundly harm the mental health and emotional well- being of many older adults. Public health interventions to minimize the spread of the virus have had the unintended consequences of worsening social isolation, financial stress, and unemployment. Results of early research efforts assessing the impact of these interventions on the mental health of older adults have been mixed. Available findings suggest that a subset of community-dwelling older adults have been less negatively impacted than younger adults, while people of color, the poor, residents of nursing homes and other communal living environments, and those living with dementia and their caregivers are more likely to suffer from COVID-related health problems. This manuscript describes two older adults for whom COVID-19 associated stresses caused significant worsening in their psychiatric illnesses, including the emergence of suicidal ideation, summarizes the literature on the impact of interactions between psychosocial stresses and biological factors on the mental health and well-being of older adults, and discusses interventions to help older adults whose mental health has worsened due to COVID-19. Timely and accurate diagnosis, prompt provision of individualized care using both pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic interventions, adoption of new technologies that permit care to be provided safely at a distance and which allow for virtual social interactions, coupled with ongoing advocacy for policy changes that address significant health care disparities and provide older adults continued access to health care and relief from financial hardship, will help older adults remaining as healthy as possible during the pandemic.","Asthana, Niraj K; Mehaffey, Eamonn; Sewell, Daniel D",Am. j. geriatr. psychiatry,,359

However, during the societal disruptions secondary to the coronavirus (COVID-19) stay-at-home regulations, there have been reported changes to the pattern and severity of pediatric trauma. We review our two-institution experience. METHODS: Pediatric trauma emergency department (ED) encounters from the National Trauma Registry for a large, tertiary, metropolitan level 1 pediatric trauma center and pediatric burn admission at the regional burn center were extracted for children less than 19 years from March 15th thru May 15th during the years 2015-2020. The primary outcome was the difference in encounters during the COVID-19 (2020) epoch versus the pre-COVID-19 epoch (2015-2019). RESULTS: There were 392 pediatric trauma encounters during the COVID-19 epoch as compared to 451, 475, 520, 460, 432 (mean 467.6) during the pre-COVID-19 epoch. Overall trauma admissions and ED trauma encounters were significantly lower (p < 0.001) during COVID-19. Burn injury admissions (p < 0.001) and penetrating trauma encounters (p = 0.002) increased during the COVID-19 epoch while blunt trauma encounters decreased (p < 0.001). Trauma occurred among more white (p = 0.01) and privately insured (p < 0.001) children, but no difference in suspected abuse, injury severity, mortality, age, or gender were detected. Sub-analysis showed significant decreases in motor vehicle crashes (p < 0.001), pedestrians struck by automobile (p < 0.001), all-terrain vehicle (ATV)/motorcross/bicycle/skateboard involved injuries (p = 0.02), falls (p < 0.001), and sports related injuries (p < 0.001). Fewer injuries occurring in the playground or home play equipment such as trampolines neared significance (p = 0.05). Interpersonal violence (assault, NAT, self-harm) was lower during the COVID-19 era (p = 0.04). For burn admissions, there was a significant increase in flame burns (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Stay-at-home regulations alter societal patterns, leading to decreased overall and blunt traumas. However, the proportion of penetrating and burn injuries increased. Owing to increased stressors and time spent at home, healthcare professionals should keep a high suspicion for abuse and neglect.","Sanford, Ethan L; Zagory, Jessica; Blackwell, James-Michael; Szmuk, Peter; Ryan, Mark; Ambardekar, Aditee",J. pediatr. surg,,359
407207,Altered increase in STAT1 expression and phosphorylation in severe COVID-19,2021,"As the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced universities to switch to distance online education, there was an urgent need to find some virtual/digital alternatives in order to continue teaching. Opportunities such as watching pre-recorded autopsy videos or creating and analyzing post-mortem computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging with various 3D surface imaging techniques are usually time-consuming and cost-intensive. Photogrammetry, which allows the creation of 3D textured surface models from a series of overlapping photographs taken from varying viewpoints, is a less common approach compared with post-mortem imaging. We created 3D autopsy case models for a special online forensic pathology course in which students could try the models. Then, formal feedback was requested regarding the possible application of this method in education. Most of the students were satisfied with the new method and ranked photogrammetry higher than the other available methods. Our results indicate that photogrammetry has a high potential in undergraduate education, especially in the case of distance education or in those countries where declining autopsy rates have resulted in a decline in the use of the autopsy as an educational tool. Photogrammetry can also be used as a supplementary tool in traditional autopsy-based education and has potential applications in various fields of medical education.","Tóth, Dénes; Petrus, Karola; Heckmann, Veronika; Simon, Gábor; Poór, Viktor Soma",J. forensic sci,,359

METHODS: Twelve DMD patients were enrolled in this investigation (mean ± SD age: 9.8 ± 3.6 y). Their physical characteristics and motor function were evaluated approximately 3 mo before, immediately before, and approximately 3 mo after the travel restrictions were decreed. Statistical comparisons were performed of the changes in motor function before and after the travel restrictions. RESULTS: The change in range of motion (ROM) of ankle dorsiflexion was significantly decreased after the travel restrictions. Changes in body mass index and other motor function parameters were not significant. DISCUSSION: An apparent decrease in the amount of physical activity due to travel restrictions in response to COVID-19 negatively affected ankle dorsiflexion ROM but not other motor functions. A more sedentary lifestyle and lack of regular physical therapy services most likely contributed to this reduction. The use of remote rehabilitation tools with the involvement of physiotherapists may help mitigate such changes and prevent more severe physical decline.","Nishizawa, Hitomi; Nakamura, Akinori",Muscle nerve,,359

Surgical and Anesthesiological Concerns,2020,"Biosensors represent one of the numerous promising technologies envisioned to extend healthcare delivery. In perioperative care, the healthcare delivery system can use biosensors to remotely supervise patients who would otherwise be admitted to a hospital. This novel technology has gained a foothold in healthcare with significant acceleration due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, few studies have attempted to narrate, or systematically analyze, the process of their implementation. We performed an observational study of biosensor implementation. The data accuracy provided by the commercially available biosensors was compared to those offered by standard clinical monitoring on patients admitted to the intensive care unit/perioperative unit. Surveys were also conducted to examine the acceptance of technology by patients and medical staff. We demonstrated a significant difference in vital signs between sensors and standard monitoring which was very dependent on the measured variables. Sensors seemed to integrate into the workflow relatively quickly, with almost no reported problems. The acceptance of the biosensors was high by patients and slightly less by nurses directly involved in the patients' care. The staff forecast a broad implementation of biosensors in approximately three to five years, yet are eager to learn more about them. Reliability considerations proved particularly troublesome in our implementation trial. Careful evaluation of sensor readiness is most likely necessary prior to system-wide implementation by each hospital to assess for data accuracy and acceptance by the staff.","Restrepo, Mariana; Huffenberger, Ann Marie; Hanson, C William; Draugelis, Michael; Laudanski, Krzysztof",,,359

Several studies have suggested that the pandemic affects not only physical health but also all aspects of society. A lot of information has been reported about the disease since the beginning of the outbreak. For that reason, it is essential to investigate the attitudes and level of knowledge and awareness that different populations had regarding COVID-19 during the critical period of the outbreak. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess the knowledge and awareness of and attitudes toward the COVID-19 pandemic among different populations in Central China during the critical period of the outbreak. METHODS: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted in Central China from February to March 2020. The study participants included three different populations: medical workers, students, and those with other occupations. In this study, a questionnaire was designed to collect information on the following four aspects: sociodemographic information, knowledge related to COVID-19, awareness of COVID-19, and attitude toward COVID-19. The chi-square test and Fisher test were used for comparison among groups. The level of significance was set at P<.05. RESULTS: This study enrolled a total of 508 participants. Among them, there were 380 students (74.8%), 39 medical workers (7.7%), and 89 people with other occupations (17.5%). Most of the participants were female (n=272, 53.5%), lived in rural areas (n=258, 50.8%), and were single (n=423, 86.9%). The majority of the respondents had attended college (n=454, 89.4%). Most of the participants said they had heard about COVID-19 by January, and most of them looked for information on social media (Sina Weibo, 84.7%), and WeChat and QQ groups (74.2%). The participants showed an adequate level of knowledge about COVID-19 with no significant differences among the groups. However, medical workers demonstrated a slightly advanced knowledge in their responses to professional questions such as the potential susceptible population, possible host, treatment of COVID-19, and disease category. A higher proportion of medical workers (71.8%) and those in the other occupations group (52.8%) were highly concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic. More than 43% of the participants stated that the lockdown of their village/city had a significant impact on their lives. Nevertheless, the majority of respondents had an overall optimistic attitude toward the control of the disease (92.1% of students [n=350], 94.9% of medical workers [n=37], and 92.3% of those in other occupations [n=83]). CONCLUSIONS: All three groups reported an adequate background knowledge about COVID-19 but medical workers showed a slightly advanced knowledge in their responses to professional questions.

411129,Pathogenesis and Management of COVID-19,2021,"The COVID-19 is an acute and contagious disease characterized by pneumonia and ARDS. The disease is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which belongs to the family of Coronaviridae along with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-1. The virus has the positive-sense RNA as its genome encoding for ~26 proteins that work together for the virus survival, replication, and spread in the host. The virus gets transmitted through the contact of aerosol droplets from infected persons. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 is highly complex and involves suppression of host antiviral and innate immune response, induction of oxidative stress followed by hyper inflammation described as the ""cytokine storm,"" causing the acute lung injury, tissue fibrosis, and pneumonia. Currently, several vaccines and drugs are being evaluated for their efficacy, safety, and for determination of doses for COVID-19 and this requires considerable time for their validation. Therefore, exploring the repurposing of natural compounds may provide alternatives against COVID-19. Several nutraceuticals have a proven ability of immune-boosting, antiviral, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory effects. These include Zn, vitamin D, vitamin C, curcumin, cinnamaldehyde, probiotics, selenium, lactoferrin, quercetin, etc. Grouping some of these phytonutrients in the right combination in the form of a food supplement may help to boost the immune system, prevent virus spread, preclude the disease progression to severe stage, and further suppress the hyper inflammation providing both prophylactic and therapeutic support against COVID-19.","Mrityunjaya, M; Pavithra, V; Neelam, R; Janhavi, P; Halami, P M; Ravindra, P V",Front Immunol,,359

However, the vermiform appendix may play a significant role in the immune system (secondary immune function) and maintain a reservoir of the normal microbiome for the human body. The aim of this study was to summarize the long-term effects after appendectomy and discuss whether appendectomy is suitable for all appendicitis patients. AREAS COVERED: A comprehensive and unbiased literature search was performed in PubMed. The terms 'appendix,' 'appendicitis,' 'appendectomy,' and 'endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy' were searched in the title and/or abstract. This review summarizes the long-term effects of appendectomy on some diseases in humans and describes three methods including appendectomy, medical treatment, and an 'organ-sparing' technique, named endoscopic retrograde appendicitis therapy (ERAT) to treat appendicitis. EXPERT OPINION: Appendectomy remains the first-line therapy for appendicitis. The patient's problem is appendix, not appendicitis. If we treat appendicitis, the problem should be resolved. During COVID-19, an initial antibiotic treatment of mild appendicitis represents a promising strategy. For patients who are worried about the long-term adverse effect after appendectomy and have a strong desire to preserve the appendix and are aware of the risk of appendicitis recurrence, medical treatment, or ERAT could be proposed.","Song, Ming-Yang; Ullah, Saif; Yang, Hui-Yu; Ahmed, Md Robin; Saleh, Abd-Arrahman; Liu, Bing-Rong",Expert Rev Gastroenterol Hepatol,,359

The present study aimed to investigate the effect of these restrictions on sleep quality, screen time (ST) and physical activity (PA) in Tunisian children with a special focus on gender differences. An online survey was launched in April 2020. Questions were presented in a differential format, with expected responses related to ""before"" and ""during"" confinement. Participants (52 boys and 48 girls, age: 8.66 ± 3.3 years) responded to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), the digital media use, and the Ricci and Gagnon sedentary behavior questionnaires. Findings revealed that COVID19 home confinement had a negative effect on all the considered parameters (p < 0.05). Significant effects of gender were found on sleep disturbances (p = 0.016, np2 = 0.05), subjective sleep quality (p < 0.01, np2 = 0.07), global score of PSQI (p = 0.01, np2 = 0.01) and nocturnal and global screen time (p < 0.001, np2 = 0.09) with poorer sleep and higher screen time in girls compared to boys during home confinement. A significant correlation was shown between Global ST and PSQI score (r = 0.39, p < 0.001).

Materials and methods: From January 17 to February 9, 2020, 38 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were consecutively enrolled in our hospitals. All clinical data and the chest CT on admission were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Firstly, a quantitative method based on multi-scale convolutional neural networks was used to assess the infected lung segments and this was compared with the semi-quantitative method. Secondly, the quantitative method was tested with laboratory results and the pneumonia severity index (PSI) by correlation analyses. Thirdly, both quantitative and semi-quantitative parameters between patients with different PSI were compared. Results: Thirty cases were finally enrolled: 16 (53.33%) of them were male, and the mean age was 48 years old. The interval from onset symptoms to first chest CT scan was 8 days. The proportion of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and the total lesion based on the quantitative method was positively correlated with the semi-quantitative CT score (P < 0.001 for all; rs = 0.88, 0.87, 0.90), CRP (P = 0.0278, 0.0168, 0.0078; rs = 0.40, 0.43, 0.48) and ESR (P = 0.0296, 0.0408, 0.0048; rs = 0.46, 0.44, 0.58), respectively, and was negatively correlated with the lymphocyte count (P = 0.0222, 0.0024, 0.0068; rs = -0.42, -0.53, -0.48). There was a positive correlation trend between the proportion of total infection and the pneumonia severity index (P = 0.0994; rs = 0.30) and a tendency that patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia had higher percentage of consolidation and total infection (P = 0.0903, 0.0989). Conclusions: Quantitative CT may have potential in assessing the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia on admission.","Cheng, Zenghui; Qin, Le; Cao, Qiqi; Dai, Jianyi; Pan, Ashan; Yang, Wenjie; Gao, Yaozong; Chen, Lei; Yan, Fuhua",,,359
414795,JAK-STAT pathway inhibition and their implications in COVID-19 therapy,2020,"First identified in 2012, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel virus that can cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan failure, and death, with a case fatality rate of ~35%. An animal model that supports MERS-CoV infection and causes severe lung disease is useful to study pathogenesis and evaluate therapies and vaccines. The murine dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (Dpp4) protein is not a functional receptor for MERS-CoV; thus, mice are resistant to MERS-CoV infection. We generated human DPP4 knock-in (hDPP4 KI) mice by replacing exons 10-12 at the mouse Dpp4 locus with exons 10-12 from the human DPP4 gene. The resultant human DPP4 KI mice are permissive to MERS-CoV (HCoV-EMC/2012 strain) infection but develop no disease. To generate a mouse model with associated morbidity and mortality from respiratory disease, we serially passaged HCoV-EMC/2012 strain in the lungs of young hDPP4 KI mice. After 30 in vivo passages, an adapted virus clone was isolated and designated MERSMA6.1.2. This virus clone produced significantly higher titers than the parental clone in the lungs of hDPP4 KI mice and caused diffuse lung injury and a fatal respiratory infection. In this chapter, we will describe in detail the procedures used to mouse adapt MERS-CoV by serial passage of the virus in lungs. We also describe the methods used to isolate virus clones and characterize virus infection.","Li, Kun; McCray, Paul B",Methods Mol Biol,,359

As the pandemic evolves, informed policy-making and strategic resource allocation relies on accurate forecasts. To predict the spread of the virus within US counties, we curated an array of county-level demographic and COVID-19-relevant health risk factors. In combination with the county-level case and death numbers curated by John Hopkins university, we developed a forecasting model using deep learning (DL). We implemented an autoencoder-based Seq2Seq model with gated recurrent units (GRUs) in the deep recurrent layers. We trained the model to predict future incident cases, deaths and the reproductive number, R . For most counties, it makes accurate predictions of new incident cases, deaths and R values, up to 30 days in the future. Our framework can also be used to predict other targets that are useful indices for policymaking, for example hospitalization or the occupancy of intensive care units. Our DL framework is publicly available on GitHub and can be adapted for other indices of the COVID-19 spread. We hope that our forecasts and model can help local governments in the continued fight against COVID-19.","Zhang-James, Y.; Hess, J.; Salkin, A.; Wang, D.; Chen, S.; Winkelstein, P.; Morley, C.

415644,COVID-19 presenting as neutropenic fever,2020,"OBJECTIVES: 1) To compare the impact of COVID-19 on the life experiences of essential workers attending a COVID-19 antibody testing clinic at a dental school. 2) To compare responses of dental, non-dental health care, and non-health care essential workers. 3) To assess acceptability/satisfaction of testing done in a dental setting. METHOD: A total of 984 participants completed a self-administered online questionnaire. RESULTS: Over 90% were healthy (i.e., not in a high-risk health-related group for COVID-19), did not have COVID-19 symptoms within 30 d, and always/frequently engaged in preventive measures. Fifty-eight percent thought that they had a 0% to 25% chance of having immunity/antibodies to COVID-19. Non-dental health care workers thought that their chance was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than others. Over 70% were sometimes, frequently, or always worried about their friends and loved ones getting COVID-19 and of resulting financial problems. Dental workers were significantly less afraid than non-dental health care and non-health care providers. For all groups, more than half of the respondents stated that the pandemic had a negative (somewhat worse or worse) impact on daily life (59%), interactions with others (65%), stress levels (66%), and enjoyment of life (56%). There were significant differences among all 3 groups regarding the percentage of individuals with a negative impact on job security (dental, 47%; non-dental health care, 34%; non-health care, 31%). However, more than half of the respondents stated that the pandemic had a positive impact (same, somewhat better, or much better) on caring about one another, self-care, and exercise. Knowing the results of an antibody test would decrease the level of stress and anxiety in 67% of respondents. Over 80% found a COVID-19 test received in a dental setting acceptable, were ""definitely"" satisfied, and would ""definitely"" recommend it to a friend, family, or coworker. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support that dental workers are as vulnerable as other essential workers to threats and psychological impacts of COVID-19. They also support the acceptability and satisfaction of testing for a pandemic done in a dental setting. KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER STATEMENT: The results of this study highlight the impact that pandemics such as COVID-19 can have on life experiences of essential workers, including dentists. It also highlights a role that dentistry can play within the broader health care system, during and beyond the current pandemic, to help with surveillance efforts of community health. Testing may also help alleviate stress and anxiety associated with these pandemics.","Fontana, M; McCauley, L; Fitzgerald, M; Eckert, G J; Yanca, E; Eber, R",JDR Clin Trans Res,,359

Analyzing and learning from HIT events could reduce the risks and improve safety but are limited by accessible HIT event reports. In this study, we propose a hybrid deep learning model to identify HIT event reports from the FDA resource and thus establish the first publicly accessible database for HIT event reports. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 6,994 samples (3,521 HIT and 3,473 non-HIT events) extracted from the FDA MAUDE database were employed to assess nine individual and 120 hybrid models on the task of HIT identification. The optimal model was evaluated on an independent dataset prior to its application for establishing the HIT event database. RESULTS: The hybrid model consisting of logistic regression, CNN, and Hierarchical RNN (ACC=0.903, AUC=0.954, F1 score=0.876) is superior to all the other models. The causes of errors include lack of root cause (72.3%), short descriptions (19.7%), and model undertrained (8.0%). The accuracy of the hybrid model on an independent dataset is reported as 0.862. We applied the optimal model to the entire MAUDE database (1991-2018) and generated an HIT event database with 48,997 reports. CONCLUSION: The first HIT event database contains 48,997 reports with an annual growth rate of 10% (â¼5,000 reports). The strategy of HIT event identification and establishment of the database could help healthcare professionals describe, understand, integrate the events and propose solutions in the context of a fuller spectrum of HIT events.","Kang, Hong; Gong, Yang",J Biomed Inform,,359

Here, we undertake a model-based global integrated assessment to characterise alternative pathways towards 36 time-bound, science-driven targets by 2030, 2050, and 2100. We show that it will be unlikely to jointly achieve socioeconomic and environmental targets by 2030, even under the most optimistic pathways and the least ambitious targets. Nonetheless, humanity can still avoid destabilisation of the Earth system and increase socioeconomic prosperity post-2030 via a Green Recovery pathway. A Green Recovery by mid- and end of the century requires reducing global population by 5% and 26%, empowering sustainable economic development by 32% and 52%, increasing education availability by 10% and 40%, reducing the total global fossil energy production by 36% and 80%, reducing agricultural land area by 7% and 10%, and promoting healthy and sustainable lifestyles by lowering consumption of animal-based foods (i.e., meat and dairy) by 39% and 50%, compared to the business-as-usual trajectories for 2050 and 2100, respectively.

The search terms ""Major Depressive Disorder,"" ""depress*,"" ""cognit*,"" and ""therapeutics"" were used. STUDY SELECTION: The studies included in this review were clinical trials of antidepressants and other therapeutic agents in MDD populations. Participants were aged between 18 and 65 years and had a DSM-III, -IV, or -5 diagnosis of MDD. In total, 2,045 research papers were screened, 53 full-text articles were assessed, and 26 articles were eligible to be included in this systematic review. DATA EXTRACTION: The data and quality of research papers were assessed and screened by 2 independent reviewers. Discrepancies were resolved through a third reviewer. RESULTS: Overall, studies demonstrated that tricyclic antidepressants do not have procognitive effects, while vortioxetine and bupropion have demonstrated procognitive effects in MDD populations relative to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Several non-antidepressant agents, such as modafinil, amphetamines, and erythropoietin, have also demonstrated significant positive effects on cognition in depression.

Beyond the widespread concerns surrounding illness, loss of employment and social isolation, caregivers are responsible for overseeing their children's educational and therapeutic programmes at home often without the much needed support of professionals. METHOD: The present study sought to examine the impact of COVID-19 in 77 ethnically, linguistically and socioeconomically diverse families with young children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) in California and Oregon, who were participating in larger intervention studies. Parents responded to five interview questions about the impact of the pandemic, services for their child, silver linings or positive aspects, coping and their concerns about the long-term impact of the pandemic. RESULTS: Parents reported that their biggest challenge was being at home caring for their children with the loss of many essential services. Parents reported some positive aspects of the pandemic, especially being together as a family. Although there were positive aspects of the situation, many parents expressed concern about long-term impacts of the pandemic on their children's development, given the loss of services, education and social engagement opportunities. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that parents of young children with IDD report significant challenges at home during the pandemic. Professional support, especially during the reopening phases, will be critical to support family well-being and child developmental outcomes.","Neece, C; McIntyre, L L; Fenning, R",J Intellect Disabil Res,,359

The association with severe radiological pulmonary changes, prophylactic anticoagulation and ICU care was assessed. METHODS: From 1 March until 31 May 2020, all in-hospital patients with a positive PCR for SARS-CoV-2-RNA and PE diagnosed with computed tomography pulmonary angiography were identified through diagnostic codes in medical charts. PE was characterised as central/peripheral and unilateral/bilateral. Covid-19 related lung changes were evaluated scoring the proportion of affected lung (max-score score 25) for all five lobes in both lungs. ICU and non-ICU patients were included and anticoagulant regimens were assessed. RESULTS: Of 1162 patients with Covid-19, 41 were diagnosed with PE (cumulative incidence 3.5%), and of these 63.4% (=overall 2.2%) had central PE. PE on admission was present in 46.3%. No differences were seen in the distribution of central vs. peripheral PE in relation to prophylactic anticoagulation (p=.317). Of ICU patients 82.4% were diagnosed with central PE compared to 50.0% among non-ICU patients (p=.05). No association was observed between the presence of central PE and the extent of radiological Covid-19 changes (p=.451). Mild (0-12 p) and severe (13-25 p) pulmonary changes were seen in 63.4% and 36.6% of patients respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, and especially in ICU-patients, a high proportion of central PE was seen and many were diagnosed at admission.

419033,COVID-19-related encephalopathy responsive to high-dose glucocorticoids,2020,"BACKGROUND: Narcolepsy is marked by pathologic symptoms including excessive daytime drowsiness and lethargy, even with sufficient nocturnal sleep. There are two types of narcolepsy: type 1 (with cataplexy) and type 2 (without cataplexy). Unlike type 1, for which hypocretin is a biomarker, type 2 narcolepsy has no adequate biomarker to identify the causality of narcoleptic phenomenon. Therefore, we aimed to establish new biomarkers for narcolepsy using the body's systemic networks. METHOD: Thirty participants (15 with type 2 narcolepsy, 15 healthy controls) were included. We used the time delay stability (TDS) method to examine temporal information and determine relationships among multiple signals. We quantified and analyzed the network connectivity of nine biosignals (brainwaves, cardiac and respiratory information, muscle and eye movements) during nocturnal sleep. In particular, we focused on the differences in network connectivity between groups according to sleep stages and investigated whether the differences could be potential biomarkers to classify both groups by using a support vector machine. RESULT: In rapid eye movement sleep, the narcolepsy group displayed more connections than the control group (narcolepsy connections: 24.47 ± 2.87, control connections: 21.34 ± 3.49; p = 0.022). The differences were observed in movement and cardiac activity. The performance of the classifier based on connectivity differences was a 0.93 for sensitivity, specificity and accuracy, respectively. CONCLUSION: Network connectivity with the TDS method may be used as a biomarker to identify differences in the systemic networks of patients with narcolepsy type 2 and healthy controls.","Son, Dong Yeon; Kwon, Hyun Bin; Lee, Dong Seok; Jin, Hyung Won; Jeong, Jong Hyeok; Kim, Jeehoon; Choi, Sang Ho; Yoon, Heenam; Lee, Mi Hyun; Lee, Yu Jin; Park, Kwang Suk",Comput Biol Med,,359

Although some antiviral agents were identified and used to inhibit viral replication, the management of cytokine storm is also a critical issue. In this article, we reviewed the literature on drug candidates for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-1) and provided a brief overview of a class of drugs that exert antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects. These molecules mitigated inflammatory cytokine cascades induced by viral infections via Nrf2 activating capacity and might have additional anti-fibrotic and anti-remodeling properties. Besides, their effects on the regulation of scavenger receptors expression by macrophages may offer some benefits to the pulmonary antibacterial defense system after viral infection. The potential roles of these agents assessed on the basis of the pathophysiology of viral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome were also discussed. Further research is needed to ascertain whether Nrf2 activators are useful in the management of viral pneumonia.","Lin, Chih-Yin; Yao, Chun-An",Infect. Drug Resist.,,359

The COVID-19 lockdown offered us a unique opportunity to test, in a quasi-experimental setting, the impact of lockdown movement restrictions on children's MC. We assessed the motor competence of 114 children aged 6-9 years using the motor competence assessment. All children were tested before and after the COVID-19 lockdown. Chi-square and 2 × 2 ANOVA (sex by moment) were used to further analyze the data. Regardless of sex, motor performances in all tests (except for jumping sideways in boys) were lower when compared with performances before lockdown. There was a marked decreasing trend in children's levels of MC, shifting from an upper to a lower quartile in different tests. The results after the lockdown were always significantly inferior to the results before lockdown in all motor tests (except jumping sideways), in the three components of MC, and in global MC. Children's global MC score decreased by an average of 13 points in boys and 16 points in girls.

The aim of this study was to identify Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) biomarkers, to investigate their correlation with disease severity and to evaluate their usefulness for follow-up. Methods Fifty patients diagnosed with SARS-Cov-2 were included in March 2020. Clinical and biological data were collected at admission, during hospitalization and one month after discharge. Patients were divided into two severity groups: non-ICU (28) and ICU and/or death (22) to stratify the risk. Results Blood parameters in COVID-19 patients at admission showed increased C-reactive protein (CRP) (100%), ferritin (92%), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (80%), white blood cell (WBC) count (26%) with lymphopenia (52%) and eosinopenia (98%). There were significant differences in levels of CRP, ferritin, D-dimers, fibrinogen, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) among the two severity groups. Mapping of biomarker's kinetics distinguished early and late parameters. CRP, ferritin, LDH, lymphopenia and eosinopenia were present upon admission with a peak at the first week. Late biomarkers such as anemia, neutrophilia and elevated liver biomarkers appeared after one week with a peak at three weeks of hospitalization. Conclusions We confirmed that high-values of CRP, NLR, D-dimers, ferritin as well as lymphopenia and eosinopenia were consistently found and are good markers for risk stratification. Kinetics of these biomarkers correlate well with COVID-19 severity. Close monitoring of early and late biomarkers is crucial in the management of critical patients to avoid preventable deaths.","Khourssaji, Mehdi; Chapelle, Virginie; Evenepoel, Anton; Belkhir, Leila; Yombi, Jean Cyr; van Dievoet, Marie-Astrid; Saussoy, Pascale; Coche, Emmanuel; Fillée, Catherine; Constantinescu, Stefan N; Rodriguez-Villalobos, Hector; Defour, Jean-Philippe; Gruson, Damien",Clin Chem Lab Med,,359

We sought to characterise biological responses among patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19 based on serial, routinely collected, physiological and blood biomarker values. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 1335 patients hospitalised with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (median age 70 years, 56 % male), between 1st March and 30th April 2020. Latent profile analysis was performed on serial physiological and blood biomarkers. Patient characteristics, comorbidities and rates of death and admission to intensive care, were compared between the latent classes. A five class solution provided the best fit. Class 1 ""Typical response"" exhibited a moderately elevated and rising C-reactive protein (CRP), stable lymphopaenia, and the lowest rates of 14-day adverse outcomes. Class 2 ""Rapid hyperinflammatory response"" comprised older patients, with higher admission white cell and neutrophil counts, which declined over time, accompanied by a very high and rising CRP and platelet count, and exibited the highest mortality risk. Class 3 ""Progressive inflammatory response"" was similar to the typical response except for a higher and rising CRP, though similar mortality rate. Class 4 ""Inflammatory response with kidney injury"" had prominent lymphopaenia, moderately elevated (and rising) CRP, and severe renal failure. Class 5 ""Hyperinflammatory response with kidney injury"" comprised older patients, with a very high and rising CRP, and severe renal failure that attenuated over time. Physiological measures did not substantially vary between classes at baseline or early admission. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Our identification of five distinct classes of biomarker profiles provides empirical evidence for heterogeneous biological responses to COVID-19. Early hyperinflammatory responses and kidney injury may signify unique pathophysiology that requires targeted therapy.","Zakeri, Rosita; Pickles, Andrew; Carr, Ewan; Bean, Daniel M; O039,; Gallagher, Kevin; Kraljewic, Zeljko; Searle, Tom; Shek, Anthony; Galloway, James B; Teo, James T H; Shah, Ajay M; Dobson, Richard J B; Bendayan, Rebecca",Curr Res Transl Med,,359

The results of the hierarchical regression analysis indicate that agreeable and conscientious individuals are complying more with preventive measures. In addition, approach, not avoidance, motivation appears to be more important in following the guidelines.

It has spread worldwide, leading to an ongoing pandemic, imposed restrictions and costs to many countries. Predicting the number of new cases and deaths during this period can be a useful step in predicting the costs and facilities required in the future. The purpose of this study is to predict new cases and deaths rate one, three and seven-day ahead during the next 100 days. The motivation for predicting every n days (instead of just every day) is the investigation of the possibility of computational cost reduction and still achieving reasonable performance. Such a scenario may be encountered in real-time forecasting of time series. Six different deep learning methods are examined on the data adopted from the WHO website. Three methods are LSTM, Convolutional LSTM, and GRU. The bidirectional extension is then considered for each method to forecast the rate of new cases and new deaths in Australia and Iran countries. This study is novel as it carries out a comprehensive evaluation of the aforementioned three deep learning methods and their bidirectional extensions to perform prediction on COVID-19 new cases and new death rate time series. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that Bi-GRU and Bi-Conv-LSTM models are used for prediction on COVID-19 new cases and new deaths time series. The evaluation of the methods is presented in the form of graphs and Friedman statistical test. The results show that the bidirectional models have lower errors than other models. A several error evaluation metrics are presented to compare all models, and finally, the superiority of bidirectional methods is determined.

During a pandemic, laboratories play a key role in helping healthcare providers and public health authorities detect active infection, a task most commonly achieved using nucleic acid-based assays. While the landscape of diagnostics is rapidly evolving, PCR remains the gold-standard of nucleic acid-based diagnostic assays, in part due to its reliability, flexibility and wide deployment. To address a critical local shortage of testing capacity persisting during the COVID-19 outbreak, our hospital set up a molecular-based laboratory developed test (LDT) to accurately and safely diagnose SARS-CoV-2.

It may be feasible to extract pharmacogenomic (PGx) information from biorepositories for clinical use. We sought to characterize the potential value of multigene PGx testing among individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States. We performed a cross-sectional analysis of electronic health records from consecutive individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 at a large, urban academic health system. We characterized medication orders, focusing on medications with actionable PGx guidance related to 14 commonly assayed genes (CYP2C19, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP3A5, DPYD, G6PD, HLA-A, HLA-B, IFNL3, NUDT15, SLCO1B1, TPMT, UGT1A1, and VKORC1). A simulation analysis combined medication data with population phenotype frequencies to estimate how many treatment modifications would be enabled if multigene PGx results were available. Sixty-four unique medications with PGx guidance were ordered at least once in the cohort (n = 1,852, mean age 60.1 years). Nearly nine in 10 individuals (89.7%) had at least one order for a medication with PGx guidance and 427 patients (23.1%) had orders for 4 or more actionable medications. Using a simulation, we estimated that 17 treatment modifications per 100 patients would be enabled if PGx results were available. The genes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 were responsible for the majority of treatment modifications, and the medications most often affected were ondansetron, oxycodone, and clopidogrel. PGx results would be relevant for nearly all individuals hospitalized with COVID-19 and would provide the opportunity to improve clinical care.","Stevenson, James M; Alexander, G Caleb; Palamuttam, Natasha; Mehta, Hemalkumar B",Clinical and translational science (Online),,359

Quantifying global migration is, however, challenging because of poor recording, privacy issues and residence status. This is particularly critical for some classes of migrants involved in stigmatised, unregulated or illegal activities. Escorting services or high-end prostitution are well-paid activities that attract workers all around the world. In this paper, we study international migration patterns of sex-workers by using network methods. Using an extensive international online advertisement directory of escorting services and information about individual escorts, we reconstruct a migrant flow network where nodes represent either origin or destination countries. The links represent the direct routes between two countries. The migration network of sex-workers shows different structural patterns than the migration of the general population. The network contains a strong core where mutual migration is often observed between a group of high-income European countries, yet Europe is split into different network communities with specific ties to non-European countries. We find non-reciprocal relations between countries, with some of them mostly offering while others attract workers. The GDP per capita is a good indicator of country attractiveness for incoming workers and service rates but is unrelated to the probability of emigration. The median financial gain of migrating, in comparison to working at the home country, is 15.9%. Only sex-workers coming from 77% of the countries have financial gains with migration and average gains decrease with the GDPc of the country of origin. Our results shows that high-end sex-worker migration is regulated by economic, geographic and cultural aspects.","Rocha, Luis E C; Holme, Petter; Linhares, Claudio D G",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.02633v1.pdf,359

However, little is known about the diversity and frequency of the paired SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific BCR repertoire after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing and VDJ sequencing using the memory and plasma B cells isolated from five convalescent COVID-19 patients, and analyzed the spectrum and transcriptional heterogeneity of antibody immune responses. Via linking BCR to antigen specificity through sequencing (LIBRA-seq), we identified a distinct activated memory B cell subgroup (CD11chigh CD95high) had a higher proportion of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-labeled cells compared with memory B cells. Our results revealed the diversity of paired BCR repertoire and the non-stochastic pairing of SARS-CoV-2 antigen-specific immunoglobulin heavy and light chains after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The public antibody clonotypes were shared by distinct convalescent individuals. Moreover, several antibodies isolated by LIBRA-seq showed high binding affinity against SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) or nucleoprotein (NP) via ELISA assay. Two RBD-reactive antibodies C14646P3S and C2767P3S isolated by LIBRA-seq exhibited high neutralizing activities against both pseudotyped and authentic SARS-CoV-2 viruses in vitro.

The aim of the present review is to report the available evidence on the interaction between these two infections. Differences and similarities of TB and COVID-19, their immunological features, diagnostics, epidemiological and clinical characteristics and public health implications are discussed. The key published documents and guidelines on the topic have been reviewed. Based on the immunological mechanism involved, a shared dysregulation of immune responses in COVID-19 and TB has been found, suggesting a dual risk posed by co-infection worsening COVID-19 severity and favouring TB disease progression. The available evidence on clinical aspects suggests that COVID-19 happens regardless of TB occurrence either before, during or after an active TB diagnosis. More evidence is required to determine if COVID-19 may reactivate or worsen active TB disease. The role of sequeale and the need for further rehabilitation must be further studied Similarly, the potential role of drugs prescribed during the initial phase to treat COVID-19 and their interaction with anti-TB drugs require caution.

Information on the respiratory system mechanical characteristics of this disease is limited. The aim of this study is to describe the respiratory system mechanical properties of ventilated COVID-19 patients. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Patients consecutively admitted to the medical intensive care unit at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City, USA, from April 19 to May 1, 2020, were prospectively studied; final date of follow-up was May 1, 2020. MEASUREMENTS: At the time of first patient contact, ventilator information was collected including mode, settings, peak airway pressure, plateau pressure, and total positive end expiratory pressure. Indices of airflow resistance and respiratory system compliance were calculated and analyzed. MAIN RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 58 years. 6 out of 12 (50%) patients were female. Of the 21 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients on invasive mechanical ventilation, 9 patients who were actively breathing on the ventilator were excluded. All the patients included were on volume-control mode. Mean [±standard deviation] ventilator indices were: resistive pressure 19 [±4] cmH2O, airway resistance 20 [±4] cmH2O/L/s, and respiratory system static compliance 39 [±16] ml/cmH2O. These values are consistent with abnormally elevated resistance to airflow and reduced respiratory system compliance. Analysis of flow waveform graphics revealed a pattern consistent with airflow obstruction in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Severe respiratory failure due to COVID-19 is regularly associated with airflow obstruction.","Koppurapu, Vikas S; Puliaiev, Maksym; Doerschug, Kevin C; Schmidt, Gregory A",J Intensive Care Med,,359

This study aims to investigate the spread of diseases among individuals over contact networks by exploring the 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in Korea. We present several distinct features of MERS transmission by employing a comprehensive approach in network research to examine both the traced relationship matrix of infected individuals and their bipartite transmission routes among healthcare facilities visited for treatment. The results indicate that a few super-spreaders were more likely to hold certain structural advantages by linking to an exceptional number of other individuals, causing several ongoing transmission events in neighbourhoods without the aid of any intermediary. Thus, the infectious contact network exhibited small-world dynamics characterised by locally clustered contacts exposed to transmission paths via short path lengths. In addition, nosocomial infection analysis shows the pattern of a common-source outbreak followed by secondary person-to-person transmission of the disease. Based on the results, we suggest policy implications related to the redesign of prevention and control strategies against the spread of epidemics.","Yang, Chang Hoon; Jung, Hyejin",Sci Rep,,359

425873,COVID-19 - neurologists stay aware!,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Antenatal corticosteroids given prior to preterm deliveries reduce the risk of adverse neonatal outcomes. However, steroid administration in the setting of a viral respiratory infection can worsen maternal outcomes. Therefore, the decision to administer corticosteroids must balance the neonatal benefits with the potential harm to the mother if she is infected with the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study aimed to determine the gestational ages for which administering antenatal corticosteroids to women at high risk of preterm labor with concurrent COVID-19 infection results in improved combined maternal and infant outcomes. STUDY DESIGN: A decision-analytic model using TreeAge (2020) software was constructed for a theoretical cohort of hospitalized women with COVID-19 in the United States. All model inputs were derived from the literature. Outcomes included maternal intensive care unit (ICU) admission and death, along with infant outcomes of death, respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, and neurodevelopmental delay. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were assessed from the maternal and infant perspectives. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine if the results were robust over a range of assumptions. RESULTS: In our theoretical cohort of 10,000 women delivering between 24 and 33 weeks of gestation with COVID-19, corticosteroid administration resulted in 2,200 women admitted to the ICU and 110 maternal deaths. No antenatal corticosteroid use resulted in 1,500 ICU admissions and 75 maternal deaths. Overall, we found that corticosteroid administration resulted in higher combined QALYs up to 31 weeks of gestation in all hospitalized patients, and up to 29 weeks of gestation in ICU patients. CONCLUSION: Administration of antenatal corticosteroids at less than 32 weeks of gestation for hospitalized patients and less than 30 weeks of gestation for patients admitted to the ICU resulted in higher combined maternal and infant outcomes compared with expectant management for women at high risk of preterm birth with COVID-19 infection. These results can guide clinicians in their counseling and management of these pregnant women.

The purpose of this study was to implement and evaluate a multi-modal quality improvement (QI) strategy to promote resource stewardship by reducing routine day 3 (d3) bloodwork and transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) for patients undergoing intrauterine insemination (IUI) and timed intercourse (IC) treatment cycles. METHODS: After literature review, clinic stakeholders at an academic fertility centre met to discuss d3 testing utility and factors contributing to d3 bloodwork/TVUS in IC/IUI treatment cycles. Consensus was reached that it was unnecessary in patients taking oral/no medications. The primary intervention changed the default setting on the electronic order set to exclude d3 testing for IC/IUI cycles with oral/no medications. Exceptions required active test selection. Protocols were updated and education sessions were held. The main outcome measure was the proportion of cycles receiving d3 bloodwork/TVUS during the 8-week post-intervention period compared with the 8-week pre-intervention period. Balancing measures included provider satisfaction, pregnancy rates, and incidence of cycle cancellation. RESULTS: A significant reduction in the proportion of cycles receiving d3 TVUS (57.2% vs 20.8%, p < 0.001) and &#8805; 1 blood test (58.6% vs 22.8%, p < 0.001) was observed post-intervention. There was no significant difference in cycle cancellation or pregnancy rates pre- and post-intervention (p = 0.86). Treatment with medications, cyst history, prescribing physician, and treatment centre were associated with receiving d3 bloodwork/TVUS. 74% of providers were satisfied with the intervention. CONCLUSION: A significant reduction in IC/IUI treatment cycles that received d3 bloodwork/TVUS was achieved without measured negative treatment impacts. During a pandemic, eliminating routine d3 bloodwork/TVUS represents a safe way to reduce monitoring appointments and exposure.","O039,; Driscoll, Victoria; Georgescu, Ilinca; Koo, Irene; Arthur, Rebecca; Chuang, Rita; Dempsey, Jillian Ann; De Franco, Giulia; Jones, Claire Ann",Fertil Res Pract,,359
426786,Covid-19 in retina,2020,"We describe a method to estimate individual risks of hospitalization and death attributable to non-household and household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 using available public data on confirmed-case incidence data along with estimates of the clinical fraction, timing of transmission, isolation adherence, secondary infection risks, contact rates, and case-hospitalization and case-fatality ratios. Using the method, we estimate that risks for a 90-day period at the median daily summertime U.S. county confirmed COVID-19 case incidence of 10.8 per 100,000 and pre-pandemic contact rates range from 0.4 to 8.9 per 100,000 for the four deciles of age between 20 and 60 years. The corresponding 90-day period risk of hospitalization ranges from 13.7 to 69.2 per 100,000. Assuming a non-household secondary infection risk of 4% and pre-pandemic contact rates, the share of transmissions attributable to household settings ranges from 73% to 78%. These estimates are sensitive to the parameter assumptions; nevertheless, they are comparable to the COVID-19 hospitalization and fatality rates observed over the time period. We conclude that individual risk of hospitalization and death from SARS-CoV-2 infection is calculable from publicly available data sources. Access to publicly reported infection incidence data by setting and other exposure characteristics along with setting specific estimates of secondary infection risk would allow for more precise individual risk estimation.","Bhatia, Rajiv; Klausner, Jeffrey",PLoS One,,359

We sought to characterize the clinical course of COVID-19 among patients with IBD and evaluate the association among demographics, clinical characteristics, and immunosuppressant treatments on COVID-19 outcomes. METHODS: Surveillance Epidemiology of Coronavirus Under Research Exclusion for Inflammatory Bowel Disease (SECURE-IBD) is a large, international registry created to monitor outcomes of patients with IBD with confirmed COVID-19. We calculated age-standardized mortality ratios and used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with severe COVID-19, defined as intensive care unit admission, ventilator use, and/or death. RESULTS: 525 cases from 33 countries were reported (median age 43 years, 53% men). Thirty-seven patients (7%) had severe COVID-19, 161 (31%) were hospitalized, and 16 patients died (3% case fatality rate). Standardized mortality ratios for patients with IBD were 1.8 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9-2.6), 1.5 (95% CI, 0.7-2.2), and 1.7 (95% CI, 0.9-2.5) relative to data from China, Italy, and the United States, respectively. Risk factors for severe COVID-19 among patients with IBD included increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.02), &#8805;2 comorbidities (aOR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.1-7.8), systemic corticosteroids (aOR, 6.9; 95% CI, 2.3-20.5), and sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylate use (aOR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.3-7.7). Tumor necrosis factor antagonist treatment was not associated with severe COVID-19 (aOR, 0.9; 95% CI, 0.4-2.2). CONCLUSIONS: Increasing age, comorbidities, and corticosteroids are associated with severe COVID-19 among patients with IBD, although a causal relationship cannot be definitively established. Notably, tumor necrosis factor antagonists do not appear to be associated with severe COVID-19.","Brenner, Erica J; Ungaro, Ryan C; Gearry, Richard B; Kaplan, Gilaad G; Kissous-Hunt, Michele; Lewis, James D; Ng, Siew C; Rahier, Jean-Francois; Reinisch, Walter; Ruemmele, Frank M; Steinwurz, Flavio; Underwood, Fox E; Zhang, Xian; Colombel, Jean-Frederic; Kappelman, Michael D",Gastroenterology,,359

We extend this work by examining whether SES trajectories and daily discrimination are independently associated with markers of inflammation. METHOD: Data were from 215 Black adults (188 recruited from Milwaukee, WI; 27 recruited from across the continental US) and 985 white adults (7 recruited from Milwaukee, WI; 978 recruited from across the continental US) who completed the baseline interview and biomarker assessment during the second wave of the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) Study (ages = 34-84). SES life course trajectories were examined using latent class analysis based on objective (e.g., income and education) and subjective (e.g., social status and financial strain) indicators of SES. The association between life course SES trajectories and daily discrimination with markers of inflammation (IL-6, CRP, fibrinogen) were examined using multiple linear regression analyses, controlling for demographic, psychological, behavioral, and health-related covariates. RESULTS: Black and white participants showed different patterns of life course SES trajectories. Among Black participants, the trajectories were Objectively Stable Low (45.16%), Downwardly Mobile (18.05%), and Upwardly Mobile (36.79%). Compared to the Upwardly Mobile, the Objectively Stable Low class showed elevated IL-6 after controlling for all covariates. Further, daily discrimination, but not SES trajectories, was significantly associated with CRP and fibrinogen after controlling for demographic, psychological, and behavioral covariates. White participants' experiences of life course SES trajectories were characterized as Objectively Stable Low (7.02%), Subjectively Downward (12.48%), Upwardly Mobile (39.99%), and Stable High (40.51%). Among white participants, SES trajectories, but not daily discrimination, were associated with all markers of inflammation (controlling for age and sex). DISCUSSION: Consistent with the fundamental cause theory, multiple independent pathways link SES trajectories across the life course and daily discrimination to racial disparities in IL-6, CRP, and fibrinogen.","Surachman, Agus; Jenkins, August I C; Santos, Alexis R; Almeida, David M",Psychoneuroendocrinology,,359

428378,What hepatologists need to know about COVID-19?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Parental involvement in m-health to consult with medical professionals appears to be prevalent in China with rapid development in Internet. More parents with busy jobs choose m-health without time limitation. During the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, m-Health can assist with health promotion, directions for medication usage and disease diagnosis via online chat and video consultation without contacting others. To our knowledge, no studies have been performed to explore the role of m-health in parents' attitudes towards child health at home during COVID-19 outbreak. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to identify the associated factors of willingness to adopt m-Health among Chinese parents during the COVID-19 outbreak, and to explore the correlation between the frequency of adopting m-Health and parents' attitudes towards child health at home. METHODS: Chinese parents were asked to complete an online survey from 25th January to 15th February, 2020. The questionnaire comprised of two parts with a total of sixteen items, including parents' demographic variables and attitudes towards child health at home. By multivariate logistic regression we explored factors associated with parents' willingness to adopt m-Health during the COVID-19 outbreak. Pearson chi-square test was used to reveal the correlation between the frequency of adopting m-Health and parents' attitudes towards child health at home. RESULTS: A total of 254 parents enrolled, from which 202 out 254 (79.5%) were willing to adopt m-Health during the COVID-19 outbreak. Parents' age ((adjusted OR (AOR): 8.114(95% CI: 1.471 to 44.764)), parents' interest in the COVID-19 pandemic (AOR: 8.753(95% CI: 2.009 to 38.127); AOR: 22.194(95% CI: 5.509 to 89.411)), the source to recommend m-Health (AOR: 4.257(95% CI: 1.439 to 12.596)), presence of chronic disease in children (AOR: 20.844(95% CI: 4.600 to 94.443)), parents' duration of daily internet use (AOR: 6.487(95% CI: 1.870 to 22.495); AOR: 8.766(95% CI: 1.883 to 40.804)), and adoption of m-Health before the COVID-19 outbreak (AOR: 3.413(95% CI: 1.234 to 9.444)) were significantly correlated with parents' willingness to adopt m-Health during the COVID-19 outbreak. The frequency of m-health usage among parents was correlated with their behaviors in regards to hand-washing (2=18.967, P=.004), mask-wearing (2=45.364, P< .001), frequency of leaving the home (2=16.767, P=.01), room disinfection and ventilation (2=19.515, P=.003), temperature checking (2=17.47, P=.007), and mental health-care of children (2=63.810, P< .001) during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: We found various objective factors to be associated with parents' willingness to adopt m-Health during the COVID-19 outbreak. Overall, parents' willingness to adopt m-Health was high. The frequency of m-health usage among parents was correlated with their attitudes towards child health at home. The option of m-Health to patients at home during the COVID-19 outbreak would be beneficial for education and improvement in self-management of child health at home.","Yang, Siyu; Chen, Yijing; Zhou, Leshan; Huang, Yuting; Dai, Jiahui",,,359

429206,Transformation of processes of external labor migration during the spread of the COVID-19 infection,2020,"The ongoing Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had a devastating impact worldwide. It is unclear as to what one expects during the “post-peak” and “post-pandemic” periods in terms of: (1) continued adherence to precautionary measures (e.g., wearing a mask) and (2) behaviors during these periods pertaining to widespread (anticipated) medical solutions that can buffer subsequent waves (e.g., vaccination and donating plasma). In this study, we examine predictors of individual differences in attitudes and behaviors with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic and the months moving forward. Of the factors that contribute to how one might navigate the pandemic – a source of elevated environmental threat – life history orientation may play a crucial role. In this study, participants (n = 209) indicated their agreement with items on attitudes toward COVID-19 precautions and medical solutions that can buffer subsequent waves. In all models, we found significant positive relationships between one’s slow life history orientation and their self-reported adherence to precautions and endorsement of medical solutions. This effect was detectable even after controlling for factors related to political conservatism and personal experience with deleterious events as a result of the pandemic. Discussion includes reflection on the main finding, demographic variables, as well as the relationships uncovered among the modeled covariates (e.g., social conservatism, political conservatism).","Corpuz, Randy; D’Alessandro, Sophia; Adeyemo, Janet; Jankowski, Nicole; Kandalaft, Karen",Front.

429566,Il vaccino può causare l'infezione da covid-19?,2021,"BACKGROUND: Decades of research supports the benefits of kangaroo care (KC) for the parent and newborn. Supportive KC devices may be an important tool clinicians can use to assist parents with KC. In recent years, there has been a rise in the availability of KC devices. However, the use, needs, and preferences for these supportive devices by neonatal clinicians have not been documented. PURPOSE: To survey clinicians' use, needs, and preferences of KC supportive devices, and examine whether differences exist based on clinician and organizational characteristics. METHODS: A cross-sectional, online survey was sent through neonatal organization Web sites, conferences, and social media. RESULTS: Many clinicians (n = 68, 43%; N = 158) facilitated KC with a supportive device, with 81% of devices provided by the clinician's employer. The most important ""Must Have"" feature of a KC device was ""Safety: Reduces patient falls if caregiver sleeps or needs to use hands"" (84% of respondents) followed by washability (82%), and ""immediate, effective access to the baby"" (78%). Clinicians' responses did not differ based on hospital setting, type of unit, KC experience, or experience using a KC device. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: To support safe use of KC devices in neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) clinical care, a device must hold the proper KC position consistently, allow immediate access to the infant, and hold the infant in place without the parent's hands to prevent falls. Training is needed to ensure safe device use. IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH: Future research should evaluate the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of these devices.","Weber, Ashley; Jackson, Yamile",Adv Neonatal Care,,359

The laboratory diagnosis of SARS­CoV­2 infection is currently based on real­time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT­PCR) testing, and imaging cannot replace genetic testing in patients with suspected COVID­19. However, with predominant respiratory manifestations of COVID­19, particularly in more severe cases, chest imaging using computed tomography (CT) plays a major role in detecting viral lung infection, evaluating the nature and extent of pulmonary lesions, and monitoring the disease activity. The role of chest CT as a diagnostic tool may be increased when the laboratory testing capacities using RT­PCR prove inaccurate or insufficient during a major outbreak of the disease. In these settings, a rapid presumptive diagnosis of COVID­19 potentially offered by CT might be an advantage, in addition to obvious benefits of delineating the nature and extent of pulmonary lesions. In the present paper, we reviewed the diagnostic role of chest CT in patients with COVID­19.","Jedrusik, Piotr; Gaciong, Zbigniew; Sklinda, Katarzyna; Sierpinski, Radoslaw; Walecki, Jerzy; Gujski, Mariusz",Pol Arch Intern Med,,359

There is remarkable progress in vaccine technology in response to this threat, but their design often overlooks the innate arm of immunity. Gamma Delta (Î³Î´) T cells are a subset of T cells with unique features that gives them a key role in the innate immune response to a variety of homeostatic alterations, from cancer to microbial infections. In the context of viral infection, a growing body of evidence shows that Î³Î´ T cells are particularly equipped for early virus detection, which triggers their subsequent activation, expansion and the fast deployment of antiviral functions such as direct cytotoxic pathways, secretion of cytokines, recruitment and activation of other immune cells and mobilization of a trained immunity memory program. As such, Î³Î´ T cells represent an attractive target to stimulate for a rapid and effective resolution of viral infections. Here, we review the known aspects of Î³Î´ T cells that make them crucial component of the immune response to viruses, and the ways that their antiviral potential can be harnessed to prevent or treat viral infection.","Caron, Jonathan; Ridgley, Laura Alice; Bodman-Smith, Mark",Front Immunol,,359

Then, the authors calculate the loss in gate receipts as a difference in the revenue under fans and no-fans scenarios. Findings: Based on the current estimates, the combined financial loss of the clubs from NFL, MLB, NBA and NHL is expected to be above 6.8bn dollars in gate receipts alone. Practical implications: The findings are useful to the league management to prepare for the suboptimal financial situation.

This study was aimed to assess aggregated risk by investigating the association of ACEIs/ARBs users against non-users of ACEIs/ARBs with the risk of mortality or severe clinical manifestations or magnitude of SARS-CoV-2 test positivity in COVID-19 patients. Systematic literature search was carried out in different databases for eligible studies. The pooled relative risks (RRs) were measured using RevMan software where P<0.05 was set as statistical significance. In total, 10 studies were included in this analysis. After pooled estimation, it was demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 positive patients taking ACEIs/ARBs were not associated with an increased risk of mortality compared to those not taking ACEIs/ARBs (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.64-1.23; P=0.48). Furthermore, the risk of composite severe clinical manifestations was not significantly different between the positive patients with or without ACEIs/ARBs users (RR 1.29; 95% CI 0.81-2.04; P=0.28). There was no risk difference for SARS-CoV-2 test positivity in patients with or without ACEIs/ARBs users (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.95-1.05; P=0.91).

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the immediate impacts of COVID-19 on students' readiness to enter clinical practice or residency and its association with well-being (anxiety, perceived stress, coping and social support, and resilience). METHODS: An online REDCap survey was distributed to 407 D1-D4 year dental students and 29 DH3-DH4 year dental hygiene students enrolled at a U.S. dental school. The survey consisted of readiness and wellness measures as well as socio-demographic variables. RESULTS: Overall response rate was 58% (N = 252) ranging from 40% among D4 students to 72% among D1 students. About half (55%) of the respondents were White, a third (34%) Asians and 5% were African Americans. Ninety-two percent were non-Hispanics while 62% were female. Overall mean (SD) anxiety score was 6.5 (5.3) and 26% of respondents reported moderate or severe levels of anxiety. Anxiety score differed significantly by gender with females reporting higher anxiety levels, mean (SD) = 7.3 (5.5) versus 5.2 (4.7) for males; P = 0.002). Furthermore, mean anxiety score differed significantly among the dental school classes, ranging from 5.5 (5.3) among D2 students to 11.8 (6.2) in DH4 students (P = 0.02).

435345,"Cancer, COVID-19, and the Black community",2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and associated public health prevention measures (e.g., ""stay at home"" orders) may impact tobacco supply and demand among consumers. This qualitative study identified multi-level drivers of shifts in inhaled tobacco product use and access patterns during the initial COVID-19 ""lockdown"" period in the United States. METHODS: Between April and May 2020, we conducted semi-structured telephone interviews (n = 44) with adults who use cigarettes and/or electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). Transcripts were thematically analyzed using a socioecological framework. RESULTS: Nearly all participants reported changes in their product use during lockdown, though patterns varied. Increased use was most common and was predominantly driven by individual-level factors: pandemic-related anxiety, boredom, and irregular routines. Decreased use was common among social users who cited fewer interpersonal interactions and fear of sharing products. At the community level, retail access impacted cigarette and ENDS use differently. While cigarettes were universally accessible, ENDS access was more limited, driving some to purchase products online. Delayed deliveries led some ENDS users to compensate with readily-available cigarettes. CONCLUSION: To mitigate ways that the COVID-19 pandemic may exacerbate an existing public health crisis, multi-level policy strategies, such as expanded virtual cessation services and implementation and enforcement of smoke-free home rules, can better support population health during this critical period. Policies that facilitate access to lower risk products can help minimize harm among those who cannot or do not want to quit smoking.","Giovenco, Daniel P; Spillane, Torra E; Maggi, Rachel M; Lee, Esther Y; Philbin, Morgan M",Int J Drug Policy,,359
435379,COVID-19 in South Korea: The Need for Preemptive Tests from the Perspective of Asymptomatic Infections,2021,"Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases [IBD] are frequently treated with immunosuppressant medications. During the coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] pandemic, recommendations for IBD management have included that patients should stay on their immunosuppressant medications if they are not infected with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 [SARS-CoV-2], but to temporarily hold these medications if symptomatic with COVID-19 or asymptomatic but have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. As more IBD patients are infected globally, it is important to also understand how to manage IBD medications during convalescence while an individual with IBD is recovering from COVID-19. In this review, we address the differences between a test-based versus a symptoms-based strategy as related to COVID-19, and offer recommendations on when it is appropriate to consider restarting IBD therapy in patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 or with clinical symptoms consistent with COVID-19. In general, we recommend a symptoms-based approach, due to the current lack of confidence in the accuracy of available testing and the clinical significance of prolonged detection of virus via molecular testing.","Siegel, Corey A; Christensen, Britt; Kornbluth, Asher; Rosh, Joel R; Kappelman, Michael D; Ungaro, Ryan C; Johnson, Douglas Forsyth; Chapman, Scott; Wohl, David A; Mantzaris, Gerassimos J",J Crohns Colitis,,359
435411,Physical and psychological sequelae at three months after acute illness in COVID-19 survivors,2021,"In the USA, numerous summer programs are available for undergraduate students that seek to increase the number of individuals from groups underrepresented in medicine (URM) that matriculate to medical school. These programs have typically been conducted at research-focused institutions, involving hands-on-research and various enrichment experiences. For 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the suspension of on-campus student activities at American universities, necessitating a switch to a virtual format for these URM-focused programs. Outcomes, however, from these programs conducted virtually, necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic, have not been reported. The Penn Access Summer Scholars (PASS) program at the Perelman School of Medicine (PSOM) targets URM undergraduates, providing two consecutive summers of mentored research and enrichment experiences, with the goal of enabling participants' matriculation to PSOM. PASS has been an 8 week on-campus experience, but during summer 2020, virtual programming of 6 weeks was provided due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants in the 2020 virtual offering of PASS completed pre- and post-program surveys that included 5-point Likert-style and open-ended questions to determine the impact of the programing on self-assessments of research skills, familiarity with the physician identity, and preparedness to be a PSOM student. Post-program, participants also assessed program administration and content. With respect to program objectives, participants reported significant increases in their self-reported confidence in conducting research, understanding of physician identity, and sense of preparedness for medical school. The educational value of the program content, their level of engagement in the program and the overall quality of the program were rated as excellent or outstanding by large majorities of respondents. Content analyses of participant comments were consistent with these quantitative results. Therefore, a premedical summer enrichment program targeting URM undergraduates can be successfully conducted virtually to achieve program objectives and may increase the availability to these initiatives.","Zhou, Cecilia; Okafor, Chielozor; Hagood, Jamal; DeLisser, Horace M",Med Educ Online,,359
435491,COVID-19 and Pediatric Orthopaedics: What's Different?,2020,"A simple analytical model for modeling the evolution of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic is presented. The model is based on the numerical solution of the widely used Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) populations model for describing epidemics. We consider an expanded version of the original Kermack-McKendrick model, which includes a decaying value of the parameter $\beta$ (the effective contact rate) due to externally imposed conditions, to which we refer as the forced-SIR (FSIR) model. We introduce an approximate analytical solution to the differential equations that represent the FSIR model which gives very reasonable fits to real data for a number of countries over a period of 100 days (from the first onset of exponential increase, in China). The proposed model contains 3 adjustable parameters which are obtained by fitting actual data (up to April 28, 2020). We analyze these results to infer the physical meaning of the parameters involved. We use the model to make predictions about the total expected number of infections in each country as well as the date when the number of infections will have reached 99% of this total. We also compare key findings of the model with recently reported results on the high contagiousness and rapid spread of the disease.","Kaxiras, Efthimios; Neofotistos, George; Angelaki, Eleni",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14664v1.pdf,359

(Special Issue: Youyou Tu 90th birthday tribute.),2020,"ABSTRACT: Inflammation has been believed to contribute to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Risk factors for death of COVID-19 pneumonia have not yet been well established.In this retrospective cohort study, we included the deceased patients in COVID-19 specialized ICU with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from Guanggu hospital area of Tongji Hospital from February 8th to March 30th. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and outcome data were extracted from electronic medical records using a standard data collection form. We used Spearman rank correlation and Cox regression analysis to explore the risk factors associated with in-hospital death, especially the association between inflammatory cytokines and death.A total of 205âsevere/critical COVID-19 pneumonia patients were admitted in the COVID-19 specialized ICU and 75 deceased patients were included in the final analysis. The median age of the deceasing patients was 70 years (IQR 65-79). The common symptoms were fever (78.9%), cough (70.4%), and expectoration (39.4%). The BNP and CRP levels were far beyond the normal reference range. In the Spearman rank correlation analysis, IL-8 was found to be significantly associated with the time from onset to death (rs=â-0.30, Pâ=â.034) and that from admission to death (rs=â-0.32, Pâ=â.019). Cox regression showed after adjusting age and sex, IL-8 levels were still significantly associated with the time from onset to death (Pâ=â.003) and that from admission to death (Pâ =â.01).IL-8 levels were associated with in-hospital death in severe/critical COVID-19 patients, which could help clinicians to identify patients with high risk of death at an early stage.","Li, Hui; Zhang, Jun; Fang, Chen; Zhao, Xuming; Qian, Bin; Sun, Yihui; Zhou, Yan; Hu, Ji; Huang, Yun; Ma, Qi; Hui, Jie",Medicine (Baltimore),,359

Within 2 months it became a global pandemic. Patients with cancer are at highest risk for both contracting and suffering complications of its resultant disease, Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19). Healthcare systems across the world had to adapt quickly to mitigate this risk, while continuing to provide potentially lifesaving treatment to patients. Bringing care to the home through the use of telehealth, home based chemotherapy, and remote patient monitoring technologies can help minimize risk to the patient and healthcare workers without sacrificing quality of care delivered. These care models provide the right treatment, to the right patient, at the right time, in the right place. Whether these patient-centered models of care will continue to be embraced by key stakeholders after the pandemic remains uncertain.","Binder, Adam F.; Handley, Nathan R.; Wilde, Lindsay; Palmisiano, Neil; Lopez, Ana Maria",Front.

The challenges of managing pension funds and the sustainability of the pension system of the Republic of Croatia have been in the public interest for some time. The same could be said for tourism, whose share in Croatia's gross domestic product (GDP) is the largest in Europe. A large part of the pension system of the Republic of Croatia consists of mandatory pension funds that form part of the second pension pillar and voluntary pension funds that form the third pillar of the system. Many pension funds have practiced investing their assets, consolidated with individual shares, in tourism, considering the business of travel companies very positive and sustainable in the long run. Also, state restrictions on risky investments and the conscious directing of pension funds' investments in tourism, which benefits greatly from them, also play a role in this.","Sopta, Martina Kastelan Andrija Kaselan Ursula",Economic and Social Development: Book of Proceedings,,359

Descriptive and regression analysis were used. In wave 8, we found that about 60% of the individuals rather disagreed about having had problems accessing medical care. Furthermore, 73% of the individuals rather disagreed to having experienced health deteriorations due to restrictions on the availability of medical care. Moreover, 85% of the individuals were rather optimistic about future access to healthcare services. Overall, slightly better past and future access to healthcare services has been reported in wave 16. Several determinants were identified in regression analysis.

437822,Triaging Spine Surgery in the COVID-19 Era,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a global health threat. Some COVID-19 patients have exhibited widespread neurological manifestations including stroke. Acute ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and cerebral venous sinus thrombosis have been reported in patients with COVID-19. COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is increasingly recognized as a result of acute infection and is likely caused by inflammation, including inflammatory cytokine storm. Recent studies suggest that axonal transport of SARS-CoV-2 to the brain can occur via the cribriform plate adjacent to the olfactory bulb that may lead to symptomatic anosmia. The internalization of SARS-CoV-2 is mediated by the binding of the spike glycoprotein of the virus to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on cellular membranes. ACE2 is expressed in several tissues including lung alveolar cells, gastrointestinal tissue, and brain. The aim of this review is to provide insights into the clinical manifestations and pathophysiological mechanisms of stroke in COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 can down-regulate ACE2 and, in turn, overactivate the classical renin-angiotensin system (RAS) axis and decrease the activation of the alternative RAS pathway in the brain. The consequent imbalance in vasodilation, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and thrombotic response may contribute to the pathophysiology of stroke during SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Divani, Afshin A; Andalib, Sasan; Di Napoli, Mario; Lattanzi, Simona; Hussain, M Shazam; Biller, José; McCullough, Louise D; Azarpazhooh, M Reza; Seletska, Alina; Mayer, Stephan A; Torbey, Michel",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,359

The pathway aligns itself to the NHS England ""Five-point plan"" to embed post-COVID-19 syndrome assessment clinics across England, supporting the comprehensive medical assessment and rehabilitation intervention for patients in the community. The pathway was first of its kind to be set up in the UK and comprises of a three-tier service model (level 1: specialist MDT service, level 2: community therapy teams and level 3: self-management). The MDT service brings together various disciplines with specialist skill sets to provide targeted individualized interventions using a specific core set of outcome measures including C19-YRS (Yorkshire Rehabilitation Scale).

Fear has been one of the most frequent psychological reaction in the population during the current pandemic. The aim of this study was to compare fear of COVID-19 between genders and to examine whether the differences between genders may be predictors of fear of COVID-19 scores. A cross-sectional web-based survey design was adopted. The sample comprised 772 Cuban participants. The Fear of COVID-19 Scale was used to explore fear reactions in the sample. An independent-samples t test was conducted to compare the fear of COVID-19 scores between genders, and multinomial logistic regression was modeling to identify variables independently associated with fear of coronavirus. In our sample, on average, female participants experienced significantly greater fear of COVID-19 than men. The gender of participants significantly predicted the level of fear of COVID-19. Being female was a predictor of medium and high levels of fear of COVID-19. The odds of a female with middle fear levels compared to low fear was 3.13 times more than for a male, and the odds of a female with high fear levels compared to low fear was 3.45 times more than for a male.

However, efforts to identify effectively supportive therapeutic drugs and treatments has been hampered by our limited understanding of host immune response for this fatal disease. To characterize the transcriptional signatures of host inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2 (HCoV-19) infection, we carried out transcriptome sequencing of the RNAs isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) specimens of COVID-19 patients. Our results reveal distinct host inflammatory cytokine profiles to SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients, and highlight the association between COVID-19 pathogenesis and excessive cytokine release such as CCL2/MCP-1, CXCL10/IP-10, CCL3/MIP-1A, and CCL4/MIP1B. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 induced activation of apoptosis and P53 signalling pathway in lymphocytes may be the cause of patients' lymphopenia. The transcriptome dataset of COVID-19 patients would be a valuable resource for clinical guidance on anti-inflammatory medication and understanding the molecular mechansims of host response.","Xiong, Yong; Liu, Yuan; Cao, Liu; Wang, Dehe; Guo, Ming; Jiang, Ao; Guo, Dong; Hu, Wenjia; Yang, Jiayi; Tang, Zhidong; Wu, Honglong; Lin, Yongquan; Zhang, Meiyuan; Zhang, Qi; Shi, Mang; Liu, Yingle; Zhou, Yu; Lan, Ke; Chen, Yu",Emerg Microbes Infect,,359

441684,Psychological aspects of COVID-19,2020,"Lacking a drug or vaccine, the current strategy to contain the COVID-19 pandemic is by means of social distancing, specifically mobility restrictions and lock-downs. Such measures impose a hurtful toll on the economy, and are difficult to sustain for extended periods. The challenge is that selective isolation of the symptomatic patients is insufficient to control SARS-CoV-2, due to its relatively long incubation period, in which individuals experience no symptoms, but may already contribute to the spread. How then do we isolate these \textit{invisible} pre-symptomatic spreaders? Here we propose an alternating quarantine strategy, in which at every instance, half of the population remains under lock-down while the other half continues to be active, maintaining a routine of weekly succession between activity and quarantine. Under this regime, if an individual was exposed during their active week, by the time they complete their quarantine they will, in most cases, begin to exhibit symptoms. Hence this strategy isolates the majority of pre-symptomatic individuals during their infectious phase, leading to a rapid decline in the viral spread - all while sustaining a continuously active economy at $50\%$ capacity.","Meidan, Dror; Schulamann, Nava; Cohen, Reuven; Haber, Simcha; Yaniv, Eyal; Sarid, Ronit; Barzel, Baruch",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01453v2.pdf,359

Methods: We reported and compared the surgical procedures performed for acute appendicitis and acute cholecystitis between two periods (March and April 2019 and March and April 2020) at Emergency Surgery Department of Parma University Hospital, a tertiary COVID-Hospital. Results: A total of 72 patients underwent surgery between March and April 2019 and 36 between March and April 2020 for acute appendicitis and cholecystitis. The average length of stay was comparable in the two considered years for LA (4.23±1.69 days in 2019 versus 4.5±2.33 days in 2020). The average length of stay in patients with acute cholecystitis was 5.9±3.8 days in 2019 and 8.23±5.5 days in 2020(P=0.038). The average hospitalization was comparable with 2019 data (5.62±3.77 days)n March 2020;whereas, April 2020 was statistically significantly longer 10.5±6 days (P= 0.023). Conclusions: Half of the emergency centers reported a drop in the overall number of urgent cases as confirmed in our department, where the number of total appendicectomy and cholecystectomy was halved comparing the two months in 2019 and 2020, 72 operations in 2019 versus 36 operations in 2020.During the pandemic, the confidence of the population to the healthcare systems was poor, and this can explain the delayed access to the emergency department of patients who suffered from an acute illness.","Perrone, Gennaro; Giuffrida, Mario; Bonati, Elena; Rio, Paolo Del; Pattonieri, Vittoria; Tarasconi, Antonio; Coccolini, Federico; Sartelli, Massimo; Ansaloni, Luca; Catena, Fausto",Bangladesh J.

442740,Sample sizes in COVID-19-related research,2020,"This review explores the idea that temperature sensitivity is an important factor in determining the success of respiratory viruses as human parasites. The review discusses several questions. What is viral temperature sensitivity? At what range of temperatures are common respiratory viruses sensitive? What is the mechanism for their temperature sensitivity? What is the range of temperature along the human airway? What is it that makes respiratory viruses such successful parasites of the human airway? What is the role of temperature sensitivity in respiratory zoonoses? A definition of temperature sensitivity is proposed, as ""the property of a virus to replicate poorly or not at all, at the normal body temperature of the host (restrictive temperature), but to replicate well at the lower temperatures found in the upper airway of the host (permissive temperature)."" Temperature sensitivity may influence the success of a respiratory virus in several ways. Firstly; by restricting the infection to the upper airways and reducing the chance of systemic infection that may reduce host mobility and increase mortality, and thus limit the spread of the virus. Secondly; by causing a mild upper airway illness with a limited immune response compared to systemic infection, which means that persistent herd immunity does not develop to the same extent as with systemic infections, and re-infection may occur later. Thirdly; infection of the upper airway triggers local reflex rhinorrhea, coughing and sneezing which aid the exit of the virus from the host and the spread of infection in the community.","Eccles, Ronald",Rev Med Virol,,359

The rash appeared on 6th day of illness in the trunk, arms with sparing of palms and soles, associated with itching. He later developed features of the cytokine-storm syndrome. The exact mechanism for the rashes is yet to be elaborated, however, it is postulated that it is either due to immune-mediated vasodilation or micro thrombosis secondary to low-grade-coagulopathy associated with COVID-19. Recognition of rashes as a feature of this disease is particularly significant to clinicians as it aids in early diagnosis, particularly in re- source-poor countries.

METHODS: We describe the 18F-FDG PET/CT results from four patients who were admitted to the hospital with respiratory symptoms and fever between January 13 and January 20, 2020, when the COVID-19 outbreak was still unrecognized and the virus infectivity was unknown. A retrospective review of the patients' medical history, clinical and laboratory data, as well as imaging findings strongly suggested a diagnosis of COVID-19. RESULTS: All patients had peripheral ground-glass opacities and/or lung consolidations in more than two pulmonary lobes. Lung lesions were characterized by a high 18F-FDG uptake and there was evidence of lymph node involvement. Conversely, disseminated disease was absent, a finding suggesting that COVID-19 has pulmonary tropism. CONCLUSIONS: Although 18F-FDG PET/CT cannot be routinely used in an emergency setting and is generally not recommended for infectious diseases, our pilot data shed light on the potential clinical utility of this imaging technique in the differential diagnosis of complex cases.","Qin, Chunxia; Liu, Fang; Yen, Tzu-Chen; Lan, Xiaoli",Eur J Nucl Med Mol Imaging,,359
443580,COVID-19 infection and diffusion among the healthcare workforce in a large university-hospital in northwest Italy,2020,"RATIONALE: Univentricular dextrocardia is a rare congenital heart disease that usually presents cyanotic manifestations from childhood. Due to the sustained dysfunction of blood oxygenation, it is very difficult to keep an asymptomatic survival. Herein, we described an interesting case of univentricular dextrocardia who suffered from initial symptoms in his middle age. PATIENT CONCERNS: A 54-year-old male patient with numbness and tingling of limbs was admitted to hospital due to the secondary manifestations of congenital heart disease. DIAGNOSIS: The patient was diagnosed as univentricular dextrocardia with pulmonary hypertension and secondary erythrocytosis based on computed tomography (CT) scan, echocardiography, and laboratory examinations. INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous hydration therapy with normal saline successfully eliminated his hyperviscosity associated symptoms. In view of socio-economic reasons, this patient refused surgical evaluation and further medical interventions. OUTCOMES: During 18-month follow up, he received no drug except for regular water intake. Fortunately, his life quality was satisfactory, and no other symptoms emerged except for mild numbness of limbs. LESSONS: In univentricular dextrocardia, it is possible to keep a long-term asymptomatic period due to the slow progress of pathophysiology. In this population, regular cardiac function evaluation and avoiding dehydration may help improve the quality of life.","Shen, Lishui; Zhao, Jin; Yuan, Tingting; Li, Mengjie; Cheng, Yun",Medicine (Baltimore),,359

Synaptic plasticity mechanisms within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) mediate differential behavioral adaptations. Feedforward inhibition in the NAc occurs when glutamatergic afferents onto medium spiny neurons (MSNs) collateralize onto fast-spiking parvalbumin (PV)-expressing interneurons (PV-INs), which exert GABAergic control over MSN action potential generation. Here, we find that feedforward glutamatergic synapses onto PV-INs in the NAc core selectively express Ca2+-permeable AMPA receptors (CP-AMPARs). Ca2+ influx by CP-AMPARs on PV-INs triggers long-term depression (LTD) mediated by endocannabinoid (eCB) signaling at presynaptic cannabinoid type-1 (CB1) receptors (CB1Rs). Moreover, CP-AMPARs authorize tonic eCB signaling to negatively regulate glutamate release probability. Blockade of CP-AMPARs in the NAc core in vivo is sufficient to disinhibit locomotor output. These findings elucidate mechanisms by which PV-IN-embedded microcircuits in the NAc undergo activity-dependent shifts in synaptic strength.","Manz, Kevin M; Ghose, Dipanwita; Turner, Brandon D; Taylor, Anne; Becker, Jennifer; Grueter, Carrie A; Grueter, Brad A",Cell Rep,,359

444800,A Tale of COVID-19: Beyond Physical Ailment,2020,"The impact of COVID-19 on public health and the global economy has led to an unprecedented research response, with a major emphasis on the development of safe vaccines and drugs. However, effective, safe treatments typically take over a decade to develop and there are still no clinically approved therapies to treat highly pathogenic coronaviruses. Repurposing of known drugs can speed up development and this strategy, along with the use of biologicals (notably monoclonal antibody therapy) and vaccine development programmes remain the principal routes to dealing with the immediate impact of COVID-19. Nevertheless, the development of broadly-effective highly potent antivirals should be a major longer term goal. Structural biology has been applied with enormous effect, with key proteins structurally characterised only weeks after the SARS-CoV-2 sequence was released. Open-access to advanced infrastructure for structural biology techniques at synchrotrons and high-end cryo-EM and NMR centres has brought these technologies centre-stage in drug discovery. We summarise the role of Diamond Light Source in responses to the pandemic and note the impact of the immediate release of results in fuelling an open-science approach to early-stage drug discovery.","Walsh, Martin A; Grimes, Jonathan M; Stuart, David I",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,,359

444889,Evaluating clinical and educational experiences withtelemedicine in a multidisciplinary high-risk infant follow-upprogram due to the covid-19 response,2021,"BACKGROUND: The publication of the United Kingdom (UK) Standards for Public Involvement (PI) (UK Standards) in research drew a clear line in the sand regarding the importance of utilising the unique experience, skills and expertise that lay people may offer to the development, conduct and dissemination of clinical research. The UK Standards provide a benchmark which researchers should aim to achieve, yet its implementation continues to be a step wise iterative process of change management. A recent evaluation by a regional research group has suggested that our understanding of PI is enhanced through reflection on the UK Standards. We report on the utility of PI in the design, conduct and dissemination of the HIDDen study, a national, multicentre clinical study based across three UK centres. METHODS: A retrospective review of PI within the HIDDen study was conducted using field notes taken by the lead author from interactions throughout their involvement as a lay representative on the study. Key members of the HIDDen study were interviewed and data analysed to explore adherence to the UK Standards. RESULTS: There was universal support for PI across the study management group with genuine inclusivity of lay members of the committee. All six of the UK Standards were met to varying degrees. The greatest opportunities lay in 'working together' and 'support and learning'. There were challenges meeting 'governance' with evidence of participation in decision making but less evidence of opportunities in management, regulation, leadership. CONCLUSION: This study concurs with previous research supporting the utility of the Standards in the conduct and evaluation of PI in clinical research. To our knowledge this is the first multi-national study to be evaluated against the UK Standards.","Seddon, Kathy; Elliott, Jim; Johnson, Miriam; White, Clare; Watson, Max; Nelson, Annmarie; Noble, Simon",Res Involv Engagem,,359

Currently, thousands of new COVID-19 patients are quickly enrolled in clinical studies. We aimed to investigate the characteristics of the COVID-19 studies registered in ClinicalTrials.gov and report the extent to which they have incorporated features that are desirable for generating high-quality evidence. On April 28, 2020, a total of 945 studies on COVID-19 have been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov; 586 studies are interventional (62.0%), the most frequent allocation scheme is the parallel group assignment (437; 74.6%), they are open-label and the most common primary purpose is the research on treatment. Too many of the ongoing interventional studies have a small expected sample size and may not generate credible evidence at completion. This might lead to a delayed recognition of effective therapies that are urgently needed, and a waste of time and resources. In the COVID-19 pandemic era, it is crucial that the adoption of new diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic strategies is based upon evidence coming from well-designed, adequately powered and carefully conducted clinical trials.","Piovani, Daniele; Pansieri, Claudia; Peyrin-Biroulet, Laurent; Danese, Silvio; Bonovas, Stefanos",F1000Res,,359

The temperature can reach 1000 °C locally, resulting in surface decomposition or chemical reactions. This temperature was measured by fabricating gold nanodisks down to 20 nm in diameter and 10 nm in thickness on mica and sapphire surfaces. The melting and vaporization of these nanodisks were used to determine this temperature according to the known gold nanocluster melting temperature variations as a function of their volume. This local heat production is very negative for precise He+ nanolithography resist processes but advantageous without a resist when used to directly nano-sculpture a nanomaterial when a very thermally conductive support like sapphire is selected.","Sakurai, Makoto; Nagano, Shoko; Joachim, Christian",Nanotechnology,,359

Here, we present a detailed description of the immune response, in mice, following vaccination with a self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) vaccine and an adenoviral vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/AZD1222) against SARS-CoV-2. We demonstrate that antibody responses are higher in two-dose heterologous vaccination regimens than single-dose regimens. Neutralising titres after heterologous prime-boost were at least comparable or higher than the titres measured after homologous prime boost vaccination with viral vectors. Importantly, the cellular immune response after a heterologous regimen is dominated by cytotoxic T cells and Th1+ CD4 T cells, which is superior to the response induced in homologous vaccination regimens in mice. These results underpin the need for clinical trials to investigate the immunogenicity of heterologous regimens with alternate vaccine technologies.","Spencer, Alexandra J; McKay, Paul F; Belij-Rammerstorfer, Sandra; Ulaszewska, Marta; Bissett, Cameron D; Hu, Kai; Samnuan, Karnyart; Blakney, Anna K; Wright, Daniel; Sharpe, Hannah R; Gilbride, Ciaran; Truby, Adam; Allen, Elizabeth R; Gilbert, Sarah C; Shattock, Robin J; Lambe, Teresa",Nat Commun,,359

Vaccination of pregnant women induces vaccine-specific antibodies that lead to the subsequent transfer of these antibodies across the placenta or through breastfeeding to the offspring. At present, vaccinations in pregnancy are limited to pertussis, tetanus, diphtheria, polio, and the seasonal Influenza vaccine. Recently, some countries have incorporated routine antenatal vaccinations in their national immunisation programmes. Future vaccines targeted at pregnant women such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and Group B streptococcus (GBS) are under development. The recently approved Covid-19 vaccines have no safety data for use in pregnancy at present, but have been considered in the UK in extremely vulnerable pregnant women or pregnant frontline health and social care workers.

We assessed the pattern of respiratory mechanics and LUS, their changes over time, and the differences between survivors and non-survivors. We additionally analyzed the relationship between LUS findings and the severity of gas exchange impairment and interleukin 6 (IL-6). This was a two-center retrospective, observational trial carried out in the intensive care units of the hospitals of Bolzano and Merano, Italy, from March 15 to April 20, 2020. We enrolled 41 consecutive patients. Seven patients (17%, 95% CI 8.5-31.3%) died. Mean compliance of the respiratory system on ICU admission was 41.6 (± 18.8) ml/mbar (42.5 (± 19.6) for survivors, 38.0 (± 16.3) for deceased, p = 0.605). Non-survivors had a significantly lower compliance over time, decreasing from day 14 after symptom onset, compared with survivors (p = 0.008). Mean LUS score on admission was 11.2 (± 3.7) and survivors had lower LUS scores on admission than non-survivors (10.5 (± 3.6), 13.9 (2.8), respectively, t test, p = 0.029). LUS score correlated with IL-6 concentrations (r = 0.52, p = 0.001) and arterial pCO2 (r = 0.30, p = 0.033) and was inversely correlated with oxygenation (r = - 0.34, p = 0.001). No correlation was found between LUS and respiratory system compliance (r = - 0.02, p = 0.299). Non-survivors from COVID-19-associated respiratory failure had a significant decrease in compliance after day 14 of symptom onset. Compliance did not correlate with the degree of abnormalities found in LUS, but LUS score correlated with oxygenation, pCO2, and IL-6.","Rojatti, Marco; Regli, Ivo B; Zanforlin, Alessandro; Ferretti, Enrica; Falk, Markus; Strapazzon, Giacomo; Gamper, Magdalena; Zanon, Peter; Bock, Matthias; Rauch, Simon",SN Compr Clin Med,,359

First COVID-19 case was detected in March, 10, 2020 in Turkey and as of May, 18, 2020 148,067 cases have been identified and 4096 citizens have died. Tuberculosis (TB) is a worldwide public health concern, incidence of tuberculosis (per 100,000 people) in Turkey was reported at 14, 1 in 2018. During pandemic COVID-19 was the main concern in every clinic and as we discuss here overlapping respiratory diseases may result in delaying of the diagnosis and treatment. METHODOLOGY: There were 4605 respiratory samples examined between March 23 and May 18 for COVID-19 and 185 samples for Mycobacterium tuberculosis in our laboratory. The Xpert Ultra assay was performed for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis; SARS-CoV-2 RNA was determined by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) analysis in combined nasopharyngeal and deep oropharyngeal swabs of suspected cases of COVID-19. RESULTS: Both of SARS-CoV-2 and M. tuberculosis tests were requested on the clinical and radiological grounds in 30 patients. Here we discussed 2 patients who were both COVID-19 and TB positive. One patient already diagnosed with tuberculosis become COVID-19 positive during hospitalization and another patient suspected and treated for COVID-19 received the final diagnosis of pulmonary TB and Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: We want to emphasize that while considering COVID-19 primarily during these pandemic days, we should not forget one of the ""great imitators"", tuberculosis within differential diagnoses.","Can Sarinoglu, Rabia; Sili, Uluhan; Eryuksel, Emel; Olgun Yildizeli, Sehnaz; Cimsit, Cagatay; Karahasan Yagci, Aysegul",J Infect Dev Ctries,,359
446385,Virtual Med-Peds: Description of the First Virtual Med-Peds Student Elective During COVID-19,2020,"Background: Many countries have introduced a compulsory use of community masks for certain public areas during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Different manufacturers offer reusable community masks in large quantities. The efficacy of these masks, however, is unknown. Method: We tested available community masks of major manufactures and determined the filtration efficacy using radioactive aerosol particles as well as air resistance with a vacuum measurement. Results: Filtration efficacy of the tested reusable community masks ranged from 34.9% ± 1.25% to 88.7% ± 1.18%. Air resistance ranged from 4.3 ± 0.06 to 122.4 ± 0.12 Pa/cm2. There was a good correlation between filtration efficacy and air resistance (Pearson correlation 0.938, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Filtration efficacy and air resistance differ significantly between the different community masks, but the two measurements correlate well with each other within the entire test series. For optimal protection, one should select a rather airtight mask. When selecting a mask, the highest level of tolerable air resistance can be used as a selection criterion.","Maurer, Lukas; Peris, Davide; Kerl, Jens; Guenther, Frank; Koehler, Dieter; Dellweg, Dominic",J. aerosol med. pulm. drug deliv,,359

Artificial intelligence enables automated and reliable segmentation of lungs with chest CT. Based on this, the purpose of this study was to derive meaningful imaging biomarkers reflecting CT patterns of viral pneumonia and assess their potential to discriminate between healthy lungs and lungs with viral pneumonia. This study used non-enhanced and CT pulmonary angiograms (CTPAs) of healthy lungs and viral pneumonia (SARS-CoV-2, influenza A/B) identified by radiology reports and RT-PCR results. After deep learning segmentation of the lungs, histogram-based and threshold-based analyses of lung attenuation were performed and compared. The derived imaging biomarkers were correlated with parameters of clinical and biochemical severity (modified WHO severity scale;c-reactive protein). For non-enhanced CTs (n = 526), all imaging biomarkers significantly differed between healthy lungs and lungs with viral pneumonia (all p &lt;0.001), a finding that was not reproduced for CTPAs (n = 504). Standard deviation (histogram-derived) and relative high attenuation area [600–0 HU] (HU-thresholding) differed most. The strongest correlation with disease severity was found for absolute high attenuation area [600–0 HU] (r = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.46–0.64). Deep-learning segmentation-based histogram and HU threshold analysis could be deployed in chest CT evaluation for the differentiating of healthy lungs from AP lungs.","Romanov, Andrej Bach Michael Yang Shan Franzeck Fabian C.; Sommer, Gregor Anastasopoulos Constantin Bremerich Jens Stieltjes Bram Weikert Thomas Sauter Alexander Walter",Diagnostics,,359
447364,Identifying and combating the impacts of COVID-19 on malaria,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic and its health, economic and social aftermath has currently overshadowed every other health concern throughout the world. There are numerous ways in which this will impact existing public health issues. In this article we aim to examine and reflect on the interactions between COVID-19 and tuberculosis (TB) another scourge which has long been the world's leading infectious killer. There are potentially grave consequences for existing and undiagnosed TB patients globally, particularly in low and middle income countries like India where TB is endemic and health services poorly equipped. TB control programmes are likely to be strained due to diversion of resources, and an inevitable loss of health system focus. This is likely to lead to a reduction in quality of TB care and worse outcomes. The symptoms of TB and COVID-19 can be similar, for instance symptoms like cough and fever. Not only can this create diagnostic confusion, but it could worsen the stigmatization of TB patients especially in LMICs, given the fear of COVID-19. Women with TB in India are a vulnerable group as gender disparities play a significant role in how men and women access healthcare in the public and private sectors. They are especially likely to suffer as part of the ""collateral damage"" and also experience the impact of the double stigma disproportionately. In this paper the researchers examine the impact of Covid 19 on women seeking TB care in India.","Suresh, Rajani; Ruban, S; Kumar, Saurabh",Health Care Women Int,,359

MATERIAL AND METHOD: The study was conducted in two healthcare facilities which serve as pandemic hospitals. 140 healthcare workers, who were employed in the COVID-19 outpatient clinics or emergency departments, participated in the present study. All participants were submitted to the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Problem Solving Inventory (PSI), World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). FINDINGS: The number of participants without anxiety was 41(29%), with mild anxiety was 53(38%). Clinically significant anxiety findings were found in only 33% of the participants. A positive correlation was found between the participants' BAI scores and PSQI, PSI scores, and a negative correlation with the WHOQOL-BREF scores. PSQI and PSI scores of nurses were statistically higher when compared to those of physicians and staff. WHOQOL-BREF scores were found to be lower. CONCLUSION: Healthcare workers might develop psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety and sleep disturbance. Such symptoms could adversely affect the problem-solving skills of healthcare workers and cause a deterioration in their quality of life.","Korkmaz, Sevda; Kazgan, Asli; Çekiç, Sevler; Tartar, Ayse Sagmak; Balci, Hale Nur; Atmaca, Murad",J Clin Neurosci,,359
448251,Can fibrinolytic therapy be clinically useful in severe pneumonia caused by COVID-19?,2020,"Introduction Lemierre's syndrome (LS) refers to infectious thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein (IJV) developed as a complication of an oropharyngeal infection. It is a serious condition which may lead to septicemia and septic embolization. LS is most frequently caused by the anaerobic Fusobacterium necrophorum. In the current post-antibiotic era, it is rare (annual incidence of 0.8 cases/million). Many clinicians are unaware of LS, leading it to be termed ""the forgotten disease."" Signs and symptoms include odynophagia, fever and easy fatigue simulating, among others, infection by COVID-19. Broad spectrum antibiotherapy should be started promptly. If a deep abscess is present, drainage is indicated. In cases of persistent sepsis or embolization, surgical ligation/excision of the IJV may be considered. Currently, the most controversial role in LS management is anticoagulation. Compared with pre-antibiotic era mortality has much improved (0-18%). Since 2004 there are only four cases of LS reported in Portugal (Medline). Objectives To report a case of late diagnosis and highlight the pitfalls due to initial suspicion of COVID-19 infection. Materials and Methods Case report. A 37-year-old female presented to our institution with left-sided neck pain, odynophagia and fever. A diagnosis of tonsillitis was made, and the patient was discharged. COVID-19 nasopharyngeal-swab-test was negative. One week later, due to persistent fever, dyspnea, thoracalgia and easy fatigue the patient returned. Blood samples showed increased white-cell-count (17.150/µL) and C-reactive-protein (378 mg/L). On CT, areas of diffuse pulmonary infiltrates were consistent with COVID-19 infection. The patient was transferred to COVID-19 area and started ceftriaxone, azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine. On day 4, considering 3 negative tests hydroxychloroquine was abandoned. Diagnosis of an atypical pneumonia was made and antibiotherapy was changed to doxycycline and ceftazidime. Due to moderate size pleural effusion a thoracentesis was performed. On day 7, as cervical pain and tumefaction were persisting, a contrast-enhanced cervical CT was ordered, showing peritonsillar thickening and thrombosis of the left IJV with emphysema (Figure 1). Antibiotherapy was changed to Piperacillin-Tazobactam and anticoagulation was started. Results After 2 weeks, inflammatory markers were normal and a reduction in pulmonary opacities was observed. All microbiological cultures were negative. The patient completed the last 3 weeks of antibiotherapy under ambulatory hospitalization. Screening for thrombophilia was negative. Anticoagulation was kept for 3 months. Conclusions In a patient with former oropharyngeal infection presenting with pneumonia, LS should be suspected. Broad spectrum antibiotherapy should include anaerobic coverage. Anticoagulation may hasten local infection control and prevent septic embolization, optimizing pneumonia resolution.","Bernardes, Francisco; Soares, Diogo; Ribeiro, Ana; Ferreira, Vítor; Vasconcelos, João; Maia, Miguel; Vidoedo, José; Pinto, João Almeida",Rev Port Cir Cardiotorac Vasc,,359

448673,What about heart and mind in the COVID-19 era?,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to health care workers (HCW) poses a major burden in the current COVID-19 pandemic. Unprotected exposure to a COVID-19 patient is a key risk factor for HCWs. Transmission mainly occurs by droplet transmission, or by aerosol generating procedures. Respirators such as filtering face piece masks (FFP2), also called respirators, are required to prevent transmission during aerosol generating procedures, as part of the personal protective equipment (PPE) for HCWs. However, many HCW were infected due to lack of PPE, or failure to use them. Therefore, the worldwide shortage of respirators triggered the development of reprocessing used FFP2 respirators or N95 respirators as standard in the US. Our proposal with H2O2 plasma sterilization for decontamination allows to reprocess FFP2, while they still meet the filtration efficiency required by EN 149. The protocol is simple, uses available resources in hospitals and can be rapidly implemented to decrease the shortage of respirators during this crisis. The goal of the study was the evaluate if respirators can be reprocessed and still fulfill the requirements for filtration efficiency outlined by EN 149. METHODS: Used FFP2 respirators - Model 3 M Aura&#8482; 1862+ - were sterilized using a low temperature process hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), V-PRO® maX Low Temperature, a FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved method to decontaminate FFP2 respirators. Decontaminated respirators were further checked for residual peroxide by a single-gas detector for H2O2. The total inward leakage of the protective respirators was quantitatively tested with 10 test persons in an atmosphere charged with paraffin aerosol according to the European Standard EN 149. The fit factor was calculated as the inverse of the total inward leakage. RESULTS: Ten new and ten decontaminated FFP2 respirators were tested for filtration efficiency. None of the respirators exceeded the maximum acceptable concentration of peroxide. More than 4000 respirators have been reprocessed so far, at cost of approximately 0.3 Euro/piece.

The objective of this study is to understand to what extent ethics has been considered in the Brazilian public policies of Tourism, and to identify elements that can become premises and/or proposals for future policies to mitigate the consequences of the pandemic (Covid-19), with a view to the common good and sustainability. Therefore, an exploratory research was carried out, with a qualitative approach, through structured interviews with 29 renowned researchers in the field of Tourism. Results point out that future public tourism policies, in fighting Covid-19 effects, should consider, as a supreme premise, the purpose beyond a base restricted to the economic progress of destinations, but mainly directed to a process of human and sustainable development and common welfare.","Tasso, J.

Indeed, platelets play a role not only in the innate immune response, through the expression of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and release of inflammatory cytokines, but also in the adaptive immune response, through expression of key costimulatory molecules and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules capable to activate T cells. Moreover, platelets release huge amounts of extracellular vesicles capable to interact with multiple immune players. The function of platelets thus extends beyond aggregation and implies a multifaceted interplay between hemostasis, inflammation, and the immune response, leading to the amplification of the body's defense processes on one hand, but also potentially degenerating into life-threatening pathological processes on the other. This narrative review summarizes the current knowledge and the most recent updates on platelet immune functions and interactions with infectious agents, with a particular focus on their involvement in COVID-19, whose pathogenesis involves a dysregulation of hemostatic and immune processes in which platelets may be determinant causative agents.","Rolla, Roberta; Puricelli, Chiara; Bertoni, Alessandra; Boggio, Elena; Gigliotti, Casimiro Luca; Chiocchetti, Annalisa; Cappellano, Giuseppe; Dianzani, Umberto",Int. j. lab. hematol,,359

Available fecal swabs (n = 95) were screened for the presence of arenaviruses, CoVs, paramyxoviruses (PMVs), reoviruses, rhabdoviruses, and influenza viruses using generic reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction assays. Here, we document the detection of CoVs, PMVs, reoviruses, and rotaviruses (RVs) in Nigerian bats. The Nigerian bat CoVs are grouped within other bat SARS-CoV-like viruses identified from Ghana in a sister clade next to the human SARS-CoV clade. The phylogenetic analysis indicated a broad range of RVs present in Nigerian bats, some cluster with human RVs and some represent novel species. Our study adds that continuing global surveillance for viruses in bats to understand their origin, adaptation, and evolution is important to prevent and control future zoonotic disease outbreaks.","Kia, Grace S N; Tao, Ying; Umoh, Jarlath U; Kwaga, Jacob K P; Tong, Suxiang",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,359

We assessed the association between ICS and COVID-19-related death among people with COPD or asthma using linked electronic health records (EHRs) in England, UK. METHODS: In this observational study, we analysed patient-level data for people with COPD or asthma from primary care EHRs linked with death data from the Office of National Statistics using the OpenSAFELY platform. The index date (start of follow-up) for both cohorts was March 1, 2020; follow-up lasted until May 6, 2020. For the COPD cohort, individuals were eligible if they were aged 35 years or older, had COPD, were a current or former smoker, and were prescribed an ICS or long-acting ß agonist plus long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LABA-LAMA) as combination therapy within the 4 months before the index date. For the asthma cohort, individuals were eligible if they were aged 18 years or older, had been diagnosed with asthma within 3 years of the index date, and were prescribed an ICS or short-acting ß agonist (SABA) only within the 4 months before the index date. We compared the outcome of COVID-19-related death between people prescribed an ICS and those prescribed alternative respiratory medications: ICSs versus LABA-LAMA for the COPD cohort, and low-dose or medium-dose and high-dose ICSs versus SABAs only in the asthma cohort. We used Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs for the association between exposure categories and the outcome in each population, adjusted for age, sex, and all other prespecified covariates. We calculated e-values to quantify the effect of unmeasured confounding on our results. FINDINGS: We identified 148â557 people with COPD and 818â490 people with asthma who were given relevant respiratory medications in the 4 months before the index date. People with COPD who were prescribed ICSs were at increased risk of COVID-19-related death compared with those prescribed LABA-LAMA combinations (adjusted HR 1·39 [95% CI 1·10-1·76]). Compared with those prescribed SABAs only, people with asthma who were prescribed high-dose ICS were at an increased risk of death (1·55 [1·10-2·18]), whereas those given a low or medium dose were not (1·14 [0·85-1·54]). Sensitivity analyses showed that the apparent harmful association we observed could be explained by relatively small health differences between people prescribed ICS and those not prescribed ICS that were not recorded in the database (e value lower 95% CI 1·43). INTERPRETATION: Our results do not support a major role for regular ICS use in protecting against COVID-19-related death among people with asthma or COPD. Observed increased risks of COVID-19-related death can be plausibly explained by unmeasured confounding due to disease severity.

Three pathways exist by which this pandemic may exacerbate ED risk. One, the disruptions to daily routines and constraints to outdoor activities may increase weight and shape concerns, and negatively impact eating, exercise, and sleeping patterns, which may in turn increase ED risk and symptoms. Relatedly, the pandemic and accompanying social restrictions may deprive individuals of social support and adaptive coping strategies, thereby potentially elevating ED risk and symptoms by removing protective factors. Two, increased exposure to ED-specific or anxiety-provoking media, as well as increased reliance on video conferencing, may increase ED risk and symptoms. Three, fears of contagion may increase ED symptoms specifically related to health concerns, or by the pursuit of restrictive diets focused on increasing immunity. In addition, elevated rates of stress and negative affect due to the pandemic and social isolation may also contribute to increasing risk. Evaluating and assessing these factors are key to better understanding the impact of the pandemic on ED risk and recovery and to inform resource dissemination and targets.","Rodgers, Rachel F; Lombardo, Caterina; Cerolini, Silvia; Franko, Debra L; Omori, Mika; Fuller-Tyszkiewicz, Matthew; Linardon, Jake; Courtet, Philippe; Guillaume, Sebastien",Int J Eat Disord,,359

An early diffuse alveolar damage pattern with predominant epithelial involvement with active recruitment of T cells and monocytes was observed followed by a late organizing pattern with pneumocyte hyperplasia, inflammatory infiltration, prominent endotheliitis, and secondary germinal centers. The patient's deterioration paralleling the late immuno-pathological findings based the decision to administer intravenous corticosteroids, resulting in clinical, gasometric, and radiologic improvement.

453917,A Cardiovascular Complication of Covid-19: Delayed Presentation of Acute Myopericarditis,2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has led to unprecedented, nearly real-time genetic tracing due to the rapid community sequencing response. Researchers immediately leveraged these data to infer the evolutionary relationships among viral samples and to study key biological questions, including whether host viral genome editing and recombination are features of SARS-CoV-2 evolution. This global sequencing effort is inherently decentralized and must rely on data collected by many labs using a wide variety of molecular and bioinformatic techniques. There is thus a strong possibility that systematic errors associated with lab-or protocol-specific practices affect some sequences in the repositories. We find that some recurrent mutations in reported SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences have been observed predominantly or exclusively by single labs, co-localize with commonly used primer binding sites and are more likely to affect the protein-coding sequences than other similarly recurrent mutations. We show that their inclusion can affect phylogenetic inference on scales relevant to local lineage tracing, and make it appear as though there has been an excess of recurrent mutation or recombination among viral lineages. We suggest how samples can be screened and problematic variants removed, and we plan to regularly inform the scientific community with our updated results as more SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences are shared (https://virological.org/t/issues-with-sars-cov-2-sequencing-data/473 and https://virological.org/t/masking-strategies-for-sars-cov-2-alignments/480). We also develop tools for comparing and visualizing differences among very large phylogenies and we show that consistent clade- and tree-based comparisons can be made between phylogenies produced by different groups. These will facilitate evolutionary inferences and comparisons among phylogenies produced for a wide array of purposes. Building on the SARS-CoV-2 Genome Browser at UCSC, we present a toolkit to compare, analyze and combine SARS-CoV-2 phylogenies, find and remove potential sequencing errors and establish a widely shared, stable clade structure for a more accurate scientific inference and discourse.","Turakhia, Yatish; De Maio, Nicola; Thornlow, Bryan; Gozashti, Landen; Lanfear, Robert; Walker, Conor R; Hinrichs, Angie S; Fernandes, Jason D; Borges, Rui; Slodkowicz, Greg; Weilguny, Lukas; Haussler, David; Goldman, Nick; Corbett-Detig, Russell",PLoS Genet,,359

Several studies have linked the severity of COVID-19 cases and increased fatality in patients with obesity and other comorbid conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and kidney disease. Obesity, a metabolically deranged condition, establishes a low-grade chronic inflammation in the body, which affects different organs and promotes the development of several other diseases. The ways in which SARS-CoV-2 infection aggravates the already overloaded body organs with inflammation or vice versa has perplexed the researchers. As a result, there is an intensified search for the clear-cut mechanism to understand the link of obesity with the increased severity of COVID-19 in obese patients.

The healthcare community is at the highest risk of infection and thereby prone to most distress. The aim of this study was to explore and evaluate the degree of depression, anxiety, and stress levels among medical college students during the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted in February and March 2020, 3 weeks after the first reported COVID-19 infection was identified in Iran. All medical college students who entered clinical courses were eligible for the study. Depression, stress, and anxiety were evaluated in these students using the DASS-21 questionnaire. Participants were selected by using availability sampling. All statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.5.1. Results The total number of participants was 207, with 143 males and 64 females. More than half of the participants (57.97%) were married. The mean duration of working experience among students with COVID-19 infection and experience in a medical ward was 3.00 ± 1.27 days and 17.40 ± 7.26 months, respectively. The majority of students had 2 or 3 days working experience with COVID-19 infection. The mean anxiety score of participants was 28.56 ± 4.68, the depression score was 29.36 ± 4.42, and the stress score was 28.99 ± 4.53. Our findings indicated that the mean scores of depression were at an ""extremely severe"" level, while stress and anxiety were at ""severe"" levels. The prevalence of ""severe"" symptoms of depression, stress, and anxiety was 69.57%, 60.87%, and 99.04%, respectively. Conclusions There is a high prevalence of anxiety and depression among medical students who were exposed to COVID-19-infected patients. Our results highlight the need to establish psychological support programs, training, and self-care for medical college students in relation to mental health. We recommend incorporation of molecular biomarker tests into an algorithm to aid in assessments and consideration of the appropriate therapeutic responses.","Moayed, Malihe Sadat; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Mirmomeni, Golshan; Rahimi-Bashar, Farshid; Goharimoghadam, Keivan; Pourhoseingholi, Mohamad Amin; Abbasi-Farajzadeh, Mohsen; Khatibzadeh, Azam; Sathyapalan, Thozhukat; Guest, Paul C; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Adv Exp Med Biol,,359
454477,Analyzing Outcomes Among Older Adults With Necrotizing Soft-Tissue Infections in the United States,2020,"Individuals are experiencing unprecedented personal challenges as a result of the novel COVID-19 virus. Stay at home orders and social distancing guidelines were in place, which has had a direct effect on American lives: forcing the cancellation of events, ending in-person school or childcare, forcing remote work environments, and leading to drastic changes to recreational activities. All these life changes can be experienced as losses that lead to real grief. However, grieving in the time of COVID-19 is fraught with unique challenges. This study recruited 257 participants from across North America to participate in an online survey investigating the types of losses experienced due to COVID-19, feelings of guilt and delegitimization, communal coping, and general coping behaviors. Results indicate that people experienced various losses during the COVID-19 pandemic, many of which were compounded and varying in degrees of intensity (e.g., loss of a loved one, loss of a job, loss of physical activity routine). Because of these differences in intensity, people felt guilty for grieving over their losses, and subsequently were less likely to appraise the losses as communal and more likely to utilize avoidant coping mechanisms on their own. The theoretical and public health implications of the study are discussed.","Scheinfeld, Emily; Gangi, Katlyn; Nelson, Erin C; Sinardi, Catherine C",Health Commun,,359

Over a 3 week period (April 2020), 1032 asymptomatic HCWs were screened for SARS-CoV-2 in a large UK teaching hospital. Symptomatic staff and symptomatic household contacts were additionally tested. Real-time RT-PCR was used to detect viral RNA from a throat+nose self-swab. 3% of HCWs in the asymptomatic screening group tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. 17/30 (57%) were truly asymptomatic/pauci-symptomatic. 12/30 (40%) had experienced symptoms compatible with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)>7 days prior to testing, most self-isolating, returning well. Clusters of HCW infection were discovered on two independent wards. Viral genome sequencing showed that the majority of HCWs had the dominant lineage Bâ1.

455188,Worldwide inverse correlation between Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) immunization and COVID-19 mortality,2021,"Purpose Surface electromyography (sEMG) is often used for biofeedback during swallowing rehabilitation. However, commercially available sEMG electrodes are not optimized for the head and neck area, have rigid form, and are mostly available in large medical centers. We developed an ultrathin, soft, and flexible sEMG patch, specifically designed to conform to the submental anatomy and which will be ultimately incorporated into a telehealth system. To validate this first-generation sEMG patch, we compared its safety, efficiency, and signal quality in monitoring submental muscle activity with that of widely used conventional sEMG electrodes. Method A randomized crossover design was used to compare the experimental sEMG patch with conventional (snap-on) sEMG electrodes. Participants completed the same experimental protocol with both electrodes in counterbalanced order. Swallow trials included five trials of 5- and 10-ml water. Comparisons were made on (a) signal-related factors: signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), baseline amplitude, normalized mean amplitude, and sEMG burst duration and (b) safety/preclinical factors: safety/adverse effects, efficiency of electrode placement, and satisfaction/comfort. Noninferiority and equivalence tests were used to examine signal-related factors. Paired t tests and descriptive statistics were used to examine safety/preclinical factors. Results Forty healthy adults participated (24 women, M age = 67.5 years). Signal-related factors: SNR of the experimental patch was not inferior to the SNR of the conventional electrodes (p < .0056). Similarly, baseline amplitude obtained with the experimental patch was not inferior to that obtained with conventional electrodes (p < .0001). Finally, normalized amplitude values were equivalent across swallows (5 ml: p < .025; 10 ml: p < .0012), and sEMG burst duration was also equivalent (5 ml: p < .0001; 10 ml: p < .0001). Safety/preclinical factors: The experimental patch resulted in fewer mild adverse effects. Participant satisfaction was higher with the experimental patch (p = .0476, d = 0.226). Conclusions Our new wearable sEMG patch is equivalent with widely used conventional sEMG electrodes in terms of technical performance. In addition, our patch is safe, and healthy older adults are satisfied with it. With lessons learned from the current COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to develop optimal swallowing telerehabilitation devices are more urgent than ever. Upon further validation, this new technology has the potential to improve rehabilitation and telerehabilitation efforts for patients with dysphagia.

This innovative way of working brings new challenges to organizations that suddenly have to switch to telework. In fact, telework raises quite a few issues for employees, related to communication, collaboration, and the application of ICT (Information and Communication Technologies). This study examined the evaluation of telework through a questionnaire by different conditional groups of 436 teleworkers in Lithuania. Through a correlation analysis between the study variables, the findings suggest that there are differences in the evaluation of factors affecting telework efficiency and qualities required from a remote worker, depending on gender, age, education, work experience, and experience of telework. The results are discussed in terms of the characteristics of the most satisfied and the most dissatisfied teleworkers.","Raišiene, Agota Giedre; Rapuano, Violeta; Varkulevičiute, Kristina; Stachová, Katarína",Sustainability,,359
456799,Pharmacy internship management during the COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the differences in the appearance of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest computed tomography (CT) images of outpatient and cases that developed during hospitalisation. METHOD: Chest CT images of 66 patients (median age, 76 years; range, 29-94 years) who underwent the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test were included in this retrospective study. The chest CT appearance was categorised as ""typical,"" ""indeterminate,"" ""atypical,"" or ""negative"" in accordance with the recommendations of the Radiological Society of North America for COVID-19 pneumonia and compared among the following four subgroups: PCR-positive outpatient (n = 14); PCR-positive hospitalised (n = 7); PCR-negative outpatient (n = 9); and PCR-negative hospitalised (n = 36). FINDINGS: The frequency of ""typical"" findings in the PCR-positive outpatient cases (13/14, 92.9%) was significantly higher than that of those in the PCR-positive hospitalised cases (2/7, 28.6%, P = 0.022). There was no significant difference between the frequency of the ""typical"" appearance in PCR-positive hospitalised cases and that of those in the PCR-negative hospitalised cases (1/36, 2.8%, P = 0.192). CONCLUSIONS: When COVID-19 patients acquire infections while hospitalised, their chest CT images are less likely to show typical findings than those of outpatient cases. Comprehensive and careful assessments of CT findings and consideration of the possibility of concomitant infections with other pathogens and clinical information, such as underlying diseases, background lung structure, and time course of the infection, are required for the management of such cases.","Shirota, Go; Sato, Yuko; Itoh, Daisuke; Gonoi, Wataru; Hayashi, Takana Yamakawa; Sugita, Yoshihiro; Makita, Kohzoh",Clin Imaging,,359

METHODS: Caregivers of 151 kindergarteners from low-income homes completed questionnaires as part of a larger study. Caregivers reported how much time children spent watching television/videos and using apps on the most recent weekday and weekend days. Caregivers also reported how their child's current use of media for several different purposes compared with how much the child usually uses media for that purpose. RESULTS: Weekly average media use was 46.3 hours or 6.6 hours per day. Counter to previous research, weekday media use was higher than weekend media use, suggesting that media was likely used as a replacement for time usually spent in school. Caregivers reported increased child media use for positive purposes, such as education and maintaining relationships with family and friends outside of the home, and potentially useful but less socially valued purposes, such as occupying the child's time while caregivers were completing other tasks. Having more children in the household was related to higher media use, and girls used media for maintaining remote relationships more than boys. CONCLUSION: These findings provide reason for both concern and optimism for the impacts of pandemic closures on low-income children. High levels of media use seem to be prevalent in this population. However, the diverse purposes for media use suggest that caregivers relied on media to supplement children's academic and social growth at a time when school and socializing were not safe in their typical forms.","Dore, Rebecca A; Purtell, Kelly M; Justice, Laura M",J. dev. behav. pediatr,,359

If so, the prevalence of asthma in subjects diagnosed with COVID-19 should be lower than in the general population. OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of asthma in Mexican children and adults with SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: A public database of the Epidemiological Surveillance System for Viral Respiratory Disease in Mexico was analyzed. Those who underwent the real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-SARS-CoV-2 (rtRT-PCR-SARS-CoV-2) test from February 27 to June 21, 2020, were included. In addition to the prevalence of asthma, some factors associated with it were investigated. RESULTS: Data from 417,366 subjects were analyzed. Asthma prevalence in children, adults, and global were 3.7%, 3.3%, and 3.3%, respectively. Although the asthma prevalence was lower in SARS-CoV-2 positive over negative patients, significant differences were only found in adults (2.8% vs. 3.7% respectively; odds ratio (OR) = 0.74; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.71-0.77); but not in children (3.5% vs. 3.8%, respectively; OR = 0.91; 95%CI: 0.76-1.10). Multivariate analysis showed in younger than 18 years that girls and immunosuppression were factors associated with a decrease in the odds to develop asthma. In adults, asthma was positively associated with females, obesity, smoking, immunosuppression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arterial hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of asthma in child and adult were lower than those previously reported. Our study seems to support the hypothesis that asthma patients have a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.

460513,COVID-19 face mask valve for nasal and laryngeal endoscopy,2021,"BACKGROUND: Regenerative liver surgery expands the limitations of technical resectability by increasing the future liver remnant (FLR) volume before extended resections in order to avoid posthepatectomy liver failure (PHLF). Portal vein rerouting with ligation of one branch of the portal vein bifurcation (PVL) or embolization (PVE) leads to a moderate liver volume increase over several weeks with a clinical dropout rate of 20-40%, mostly due to tumor progression during the waiting period. Accelerated liver regeneration by the Associating Liver Partition and Portal vein Ligation for Staged hepatectomy (ALPPS) was poised to overcome this limitation by reduction of the waiting time, but failed due increased perioperative complications. Simultaneous portal and hepatic vein embolization (PVE/HVE) is a novel minimal invasive way to induce rapid liver growth without the need of two surgeries. PURPOSE: This article summarizes published results of PVE/HVE and analyzes what is known about its efficacy to achieve resection, safety, and the volume changes induced. CONCLUSIONS: PVE/HVE holds promise to induce accelerated liver regeneration in a similar safety profile to PVE. The demonstrated accelerated hypertrophy may increase resectability. Randomized trials will have to compare PVE/HVE and PVE to determine if PVE/HVE is superior to PVE.","Heil, Jan; Schadde, Erik",Langenbeck&#039;s arch. surg,,359

The race for a safe and efficacious vaccine was thus initiated with government agencies as well as major pharmaceutical companies as frontrunners. An ideal vaccine would activate multiple arms of the adaptive immune system to generate cytotoxic T cell responses as well as neutralizing antibody responses, while avoiding pathological or deleterious immune responses that result in tissue damage or exacerbation of the disease. Developing an effective vaccine requires an inter-disciplinary effort involving virology, protein biology, biotechnology, immunology and pharmaceutical sciences. In this review, we provide a brief overview of the pathology and immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, which are fundamental to vaccine development. We then summarize the rationale for developing COVID-19 vaccines and provide novel insights into vaccine development from a pharmaceutical science perspective, such as selection of different antigens, adjuvants, delivery platforms and formulations. Finally, we review multiple clinical trial outcomes of novel vaccines in terms of safety and efficacy.","Hofman, K.; Shenoy, G. N.; Chak, V.; Balu-Iyer, S. V.",Immunological Investigations,,359
460735,Surgical Jeopardy: Play to Learn,2020,"The aim of this paper is to present traditional nursery rhyme as a form easy to bring closer to children using the symbolic interaction method, through a presentation of the dance structure, which stimulates various activities Nursery rhyme featuring text shown with movement, animation, and singing such as “Baby Shark” clearly indicates an additional arousal of certain meanings, sense and emotions in children Therefore, nursery rhyme is shown in this paper as a general culture concept and a general context concept, which can be applied to encounters among individuals of different cultural or ethnic backgrounds Regardless of the specifics of cultural background and the social situation involved, the nursery rhyme can become interculturally acceptable even in the context of the “new normality” Namely, employing an interdisciplinary approach within sociology, literature and kinesiology, the paper will show how “Baby Shark”, in addition to games and content that is recognizable to children, e g role and position within the nuclear and the extended family, offers children, in moments of the global pandemic COVID-19, a sense of security at the level of recognizing the world of childhood which they belong to If performed in a different environment, space, and context, this nursery rhyme can turn from a song with entertaining content to a song that raises morale, removes fear, and instills hope Furthermore, showing children, as recipients, certain contents of the rhyme through movement results in an interaction of different meanings and a synthesis thereof into a new meaning with members of other (sub) cultures This is additionally supported by the fact that this nursery rhyme, sang mostly in English, is very popular However, due to the technologically more modern social communication model, because of which the rhyme is a part of “secondary orality”, language barriers are broken both in the original rhyme and in a number of its versions Copyright © 2020 by authors, all rights reserved Authors agree that this article remains permanently open access under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License 4 0 International License","Schreiber, T.

The exact images at end-inspiratory or end-expiratory phases can be chosen accurately. Purpose: To investigate the correlation of the projected lung area (PLA) by dynamic chest X-ray with pulmonary functions. Material and Methods: One hundred sixty-two healthy volunteers who received medical check-ups for health screening were included in this study. All subjects underwent DXR in both posteroanterior (PA) and lateral views and pulmonary function tests on the same day. All the volunteers took several tidal breaths before one forced breath as instructed. The outlines of lungs were contoured manually on the workstation with reference to the motion of diaphragm and the graph of pixel values. The PLAs were calculated automatically, and correlations with pulmonary functions and demographic data were analyzed statistically. Results: The PLAs have correlation with physical characteristics, including height, weight and BMI, and pulmonary functions such as vital capacity (VC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1). VC and FEV 1revealed moderate correlation with the PLAs of PA view in forced inspiratory phase (VC: right, r = 0.65; left, r = 0.69. FEV1: right, r = 0.54; left, r = 0.59). Multivariate analysis showed that body mass index (BMI), sex and VC were considered independent correlation factors, respectively. Conclusion: PLA showed statistically significant correlation with pulmonary functions. Our results indicate DXR has a possibility to serve as an alternate method for pulmonary function tests in subjects requiring contact inhibition including patients with suspected or confirmed covid-19.","Hino, Takuya; Hata, Akinori; Hida, Tomoyuki; Yamada, Yoshitake; Ueyama, Masako; Araki, Tetsuro; Kamitani, Takeshi; Nishino, Mizuki; Kurosaki, Atsuko; Jinzaki, Masahiro; Ishigami, Kousei; Honda, Hiroshi; Hatabu, Hiroto; Kudoh, Shoji",Eur.

We sought to determine whether the electrocardiogram (ECG) on hospital presentation provides prognostic information, specifically related to death. METHODS AND RESULTS: We performed a retrospective cohort study in patients with COVID-19 who had an ECG at or near hospital admission. Clinical characteristics and ECG variables were manually abstracted from the electronic health record and first ECG. Our primary outcome was death. THERE WERE: 756 patients who presented to a large New York City teaching hospital with COVID-19 who underwent an ECG. The mean age was 63.3 ± 16 years, 37% were women, 61% of patients were nonwhite, and 57% had hypertension; 90 (11.9%) died. In a multivariable logistic regression that included age, ECG, and clinical characteristics, the presence of one or more atrial premature contractions (odds ratio [OR] 2.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.23-5.36, Pâ¯=â¯.01), a right bundle branch block or intraventricular block (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.32-5.18, Pâ¯=â¯.002), ischemic T-wave inversion (OR 3.49, 95% CI 1.56-7.80, Pâ¯=â¯.002), and nonspecific repolarization (OR 2.31, 95% CI 1.27-4.21, Pâ¯=â¯.006) increased the odds of death. ST elevation was rare (nâ¯=â¯5 [0.7%]). CONCLUSIONS: We found that patients with ECG findings of both left-sided heart disease (atrial premature contractions, intraventricular block, repolarization abnormalities) and right-sided disease (right bundle branch block) have higher odds of death. ST elevation at presentation was rare.","McCullough, S Andrew; Goyal, Parag; Krishnan, Udhay; Choi, Justin J; Safford, Monika M; Okin, Peter M",J Card Fail,,359
462339,Mucormycosis- A Dreaded Complication Of Covid-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Influenza immunization is a highly effective method of reducing illness, hospitalization and mortality from this disease. However, influenza vaccination rates in the U.S. remain below public health targets and persistent structural inequities reduce the likelihood that Black, American Indian and Alaska Native, Latina/o, Asian groups, and populations of low socioeconomic status will receive the influenza vaccine. METHODS: We analyzed correlates of influenza vaccination rates using the 2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) in the year 2020. Our analysis compared influenza vaccination as the outcome of interest with the variables age, sex, race, education, income, geographic location, health insurance status, access to primary care, history of delaying care due to cost, and comorbidities such as: asthma, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, body mass index, cancer and diabetes. RESULTS: Non-Hispanic White (46.5%) and Asian (44.1%) participants are more likely to receive the influenza vaccine compared to Non-Hispanic Black (36.7%), Hispanic (33.9%), American Indian/Alaskan Native (36.6%), and Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander (37.9%) participants. We found persistent structural inequities that predict influenza vaccination, within and across racial and ethnic groups, including not having health insurance [OR: 0.51 (0.47-0.55)], not having regular access to primary care [OR: 0.50 (0.48-0.52)], and the need to delay medical care due to cost [OR: 0.75 (0.71-0.79)]. CONCLUSION: As COVID-19 vaccination efforts evolve, it is important for physicians and policymakers to identify the structural impediments to equitable U.S. influenza vaccination so that future vaccination campaigns are not impeded by these barriers to immunization.","Brewer, Lara I; Ommerborn, Mark J; Nguyen, Augustina Le; Clark, Cheryl R",BMC Public Health,,359

462758,Recognizing and Avoiding the Most Common Mistakes in Quality Improvement,2020,"The Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and adapted to infect humans. Several SARS-CoV-2 strains have been identified. Genetic variation is fundamental to virus evolution, and in response to selection pressure, is manifested as the emergence of new strains and species adapted to different hosts or with novel pathogenicity. The combination of variation and selection forms a genetic footprint on the genome, consisting of the preferential accumulation of mutations in particular areas. Properties of betacoronaviruses contributing to variation and the emergence of new strains and species are beginning to be elucidated. To better understand their variation, we profiled the accumulation of mutations in all species in the genus Betacoronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2 and two other species that infect humans: SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). Variation profiles identified both genetically stable and variable areas at homologous locations across species within the genus Betacoronavirus. The S glycoprotein is the most variable part of the genome and is structurally disordered. Other variable parts include proteins 3, 7, and ORF8, which participate in replication and suppression of antiviral defense. In contrast, replication proteins in ORF 1b are the least variable. Collectively, our results show that variation and structural disorder in the S glycoprotein is a general feature of all members of the genus Betacoronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2. These findings highlight the potential for the continual emergence of new species and strains with novel biological properties and indicate that the S glycoprotein has a critical role in host adaptation. IMPORTANCE Natural infection with SARS-CoV-2 and vaccines trigger the formation of antibodies against the S glycoprotein, which are detected by antibody-based diagnostic tests. Our analysis showed that variation in the S glycoprotein is a general feature of all species in the genus Betacoronavirus including three species that infect humans: SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and MERS-CoV. The variable nature of the S glycoprotein provides an explanation for the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the differentiation of SARS-CoV-2 into strains, and the probability of SARS-CoV-2 repeated infections in people. Variation of the S glycoprotein also has important implications for the reliability of SARS-CoV-2 antibody-based diagnostic tests and the design and deployment of vaccines and antiviral drugs. These findings indicate that adjustments to vaccine design and deployment and to antibody-based diagnostic tests are necessary to account for S glycoprotein variation.","LaTourrette, Katherine; Holste, Natalie M; Rodriguez-Peña, Rosalba; Leme, Raquel Arruda; Garcia-Ruiz, Hernan",J Virol,,359

Although the mutation rate is limited, recently introduced mutations in SARS-CoV-2 have the potential to alter viral fitness. In addition to amino acid changes, mutations could affect RNA secondary structure critical to viral life cycle, or interfere with sequences targeted by host miRNAs. We have analysed subsets of genomes from SARS-CoV-2 isolates from around the globe and show that several mutations introduce changes in Watson-Crick pairing, with resultant changes in predicted secondary structure. Filtering to targets matching miRNAs expressed in SARS-CoV-2-permissive host cells, we identified ten separate target sequences in the SARS-CoV-2 genome; three of these targets have been lost through conserved mutations. A genomic site targeted by the highly abundant miR-197-5p, overexpressed in patients with cardiovascular disease, is lost by a conserved mutation. Our results are compatible with a model that SARS-CoV-2 replication within the human host is constrained by host miRNA defences. The impact of these and further mutations on secondary structures, miRNA targets or potential splice sites offers a new context in which to view future SARS-CoV-2 evolution, and a potential platform for engineering conditional attenuation to vaccine development, as well as providing a better understanding of viral tropism and pathogenesis.","Hosseini Rad Sm, Ali; McLellan, Alexander D",,,359

METHODS: HLA-G tissue expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry in biopsies collected from 151 patients (90 CD, 61 UC) and in surgical resection specimens (28 CD, 12 UC). Surgical material from 24 healthy controls was also assessed. Plasma sHLA-G levels (97 CD, 81 UC, and 120 controls) were evaluated using ELISA. RESULTS: HLA-G expression was similarly observed in the intestinal epithelial cells of control and CD/UC specimens. However, in biopsies, the plasma cells/lymphocytes infiltrating the lamina propria in CD/UC presented (1) increased HLA-G expression compared to controls (P < 0.0001), (2) greater cell staining in UC cells than in CD cells irrespective of disease extent (P = 0.0011), and (3) an increased number of infiltrating cells in the inflammatory CD phenotype compared to that in the stenosing and fistulizing phenotypes (P = 0.0407). In surgical specimens, CD/UC patients exhibited higher infiltrating cell HLA-G expression in lesion areas than in margins. sHLA-G levels were higher in UC/CD patients (P < 0.0001) than in controls, but no difference was observed between diseases. CONCLUSIONS: Increased infiltrating cell HLA-G expression associated with increased sHLA-G levels in CD/UC patients may reflect ongoing host strategies to suppress chronic inflammation.","da Costa Ferreira, Sandro; Sadissou, Ibrahim Abiodoun; Parra, Rogério Serafim; Feitosa, Marley Ribeiro; Neto, Fermino Sanches Lizarte; Pretti da Cunha Tirapelli, Daniela; Ramalho, Leandra Naira Zambelli; Féres, Omar; da Rocha, José Joaquim Ribeiro; Donadi, Eduardo Antônio; de Almeida Troncon, Luiz Ernesto",Dig. dis. sci,,359

Six plots of a susceptible wheat cultivar were planted at Cuatro Cañadas (CC), Okinawa 1 (OK1), and Okinawa 2 (OK2) in 2015. Spike blast incidence (INC) and severity (SEV) and leaf blast severity (LEAF) were quantified in each plot at regular intervals on a 10 × 10 grid (n = 100 clusters of spikes), beginning at head emergence (Feekes growth stage 10.5), for a total of nine assessments at CC, six at OK1, and six at OK2. Spike blast increased over time for 20 to 30 days before approaching a mean INC of 100% and a mean SEV of 60 to 75%. The logistic model was the most appropriate for describing the temporal dynamics of spike blast. The highest absolute rates of disease increase occurred earliest at OK1 and latest at OK2, and in all cases it coincided with major rain events. Estimated y0 values (initial blast intensity) were significantly (P < 0.05) higher at OK1 than at CC or OK2, whereas rL values (the logistic rate parameter) were significantly higher at OK2 than at CC or OK1. It took about 10 fewer days for SEV to reach 10, 15, or 20% at OK1 compared with OK2 and CC. Based on survival analyses, the survivor functions for time to 10, 15 and 20% SEV (ts) were significantly different between OK1 and the other locations, with the probabilities of SEV reaching the thresholds being highest at OK1. LEAF at 21 days after Feekes 10.5 had a significant effect on ts at OK1.

466801,The Receptor for Advanced Glycation End Product (RAGE) Pathway in COVID-19,2020,"Background. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, surgical operations have been drastically reduced in South Africa (SA). Guidelines on surgical prioritisation during COVID-19 have been published, but are specific to high-income countries. There is a pressing need for context-specific guidelines and a validated tool for prioritising surgical cases during the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2020, the South African National Surgical Obstetric Anaesthesia Plan Task Team was asked by the National Department of Health to establish a national framework for COVID-19 surgical prioritisation. Objectives. To develop a national framework for COVID-19 surgical prioritisation, including a set of recommendations and a risk calculator for operative care. Methods. The surgical prioritisation framework was developed in three stages: (i) a literature review of international, national and local recommendations on COVID-19 and surgical care was conducted;(ii) a set of recommendations was drawn up based on the available literature and through consensus of the COVID-19 Task Team;and (iii) a COVID-19 surgical risk calculator was developed and evaluated. Results. A total of 30 documents were identified from which recommendations around prioritisation of surgical care were used to draw up six recommendations for preoperative COVID-19 screening and testing as well as the use of appropriate personal protective equipment. Ninety-nine perioperative practitioners from eight SA provinces evaluated the COVID-19 surgical risk calculator, which had high acceptability and a high level of concordance (81%) with current clinical practice. Conclusions. This national framework on COVID-19 surgical prioritisation can help hospital teams make ethical, equitable and personalised decisions whether to proceed with or delay surgical operations during this unprecedented epidemic.","Chu, K.

467106,A prospect on the use of antiviral drugs to control local outbreaks of COVID-19,2020,"The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has attracted attention to the challenge of neuroinflammation as an unavoidable component of viral infections. Acute neuroinflammatory responses include activation of resident tissue macrophages in the CNS followed by release of a variety of cytokines and chemokines associated with activation of oxidative stress and delayed neuron damage. This makes the search for treatments with indirect anti-inflammatory properties relevant. From this point of view, attention is focused on further study of the treatment of patients with COVID-19 with dipyridamole (Curantil) which, having antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects, can inhibit acute inflammatory activity and progression of fibrosis, is a drug with potential, especially among patients with early increases in the D-dimer concentration and severe signs of microangiopathy.","Putilina, M V; Grishin, D V",Neurosci Behav Physiol,,359

In this paper, we propose a new self-supervised training objective for multi-relational graph representation learning, via simply incorporating relation prediction into the commonly used 1vsAll objective. The new training objective contains not only terms for predicting the subject and object of a given triple, but also a term for predicting the relation type. We analyse how this new objective impacts multi-relational learning in KBC: experiments on a variety of datasets and models show that relation prediction can significantly improve entity ranking, the most widely used evaluation task for KBC, yielding a 6.1% increase in MRR and 9.9% increase in Hits@1 on FB15k-237 as well as a 3.1% increase in MRR and 3.4% in Hits@1 on Aristo-v4. Moreover, we observe that the proposed objective is especially effective on highly multi-relational datasets, i.e. datasets with a large number of predicates, and generates better representations when larger embedding sizes are used.","Chen, Yihong; Minervini, Pasquale; Riedel, Sebastian; Stenetorp, Pontus",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.02834v1.pdf,359

Intervention programs to prevent e-cigarette initiation administered by authority figures are met with more resistance from youth compared to peer-led programs. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and implementation process of using social network analysis (SNA) to identify student peer leaders in schools and train them to deliver e-cigarette prevention programming to their peers. Nine schools were recruited to participate in the study during the 2019-2020 school year. Schools were assigned to one of three conditions: (1) expert; (2) peer-random (selected peer-leaders would teach to random students); and (3) peer-fixed (selected peer-leaders would teach to assigned students based on nominations). Study participation varied by day due to school attendance, with 686 participants at baseline and 608 at posttest. Almost all students who did not complete the study resulted from the interruption of schools being closed due to COVID-19. Implementation issues fell into three categories: (1) scheduling, (2) day-of logistics, and (3) student group dynamics. Overall, the results showed positive satisfaction among teachers, who unanimously found the program appropriate for the grade-level and that peer-leaders worked well within their groups. Peer-led students-both random and assigned-reported having more fun and willing to tell friends to try the program compared to expert-led students. This study demonstrated the feasibility of implementing a peer-led e-cigarette prevention program for 6th grade students, using SNA to provide intervention rigidity and validity.","Chu, Kar-Hai; Sidani, Jaime; Matheny, Sara; Rothenberger, Scott D; Miller, Elizabeth; Valente, Thomas; Robertson, Linda",Addict Behav,,359

470297,COVID-19 and the gastrointestinal tract: Emerging clinical data,2020,"BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has dramatically changed societies in 2020. Since the end of February, Europe has been hit particularly hard by COVID-19, but there are major country differences in both the spread of the virus and measures taken to stop the virus. Social psychological factors such as institutional trust could be important in understanding the development of the epidemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine country variations of COVID-19 mortality in Europe by analyzing social risk factors explaining the spread of the disease, restrictions and control measures, and institutional trust. METHODS: The present study was based on a background analysis of European Social Survey data on 25 European countries (N=47,802). Multilevel mixed effects linear regression models focused on 84 days of the COVID-19 epidemic (January 22 to April 14, 2020) and modelled the daily COVID-19 mortality. Analysis focused on the impact of social relations, restrictions, and institutional trust within each country. RESULTS: The spread of the COVID-19 epidemic has been fast everywhere, but the findings revealed significant differences between countries in COVID-19 mortality. Perceived sociability predicted higher COVID-19 mortality. Major differences between the 25 countries were found in reaction times to the crisis. Late reaction to the crisis predicted later mortality figures. Institutional trust was associated with lower COVID-19 mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The analyses demonstrated the importance of societal and social psychological factors in the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. By considering multiple perspectives, this study showed that country differences in Europe are major, and this will have an impact on how countries will cope with the ongoing crisis in the following months. The results indicated the importance of timely restrictions and cooperation with people.","Oksanen, Atte; Kaakinen, Markus; Latikka, Rita; Savolainen, Iina; Savela, Nina; Koivula, Aki",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,359

470987,Cardiopulmonary resuscitation in the pediatric patient with suspicion or carrier of COVID-19,2020,"Purpose: The current scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic has forced dentists to prepare themselves by updating their knowledge and receive training to face the present and after effects of COVID-19. The present survey was thus conducted to assess the knowledge, risk perception, attitude, and preparedness of the dentists in India about COVID-19. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was carried out among registered dentists in India. A self-administered, anonymous, questionnaire comprising of 25 closeended questions was circulated to gather the relevant information. A total of 765 dentists submitted a response, out of which 646 complete responses were included in the statistical analysis. Pearson’s Chi-square test was used for inter-group statistical comparison. Results: The majority (80.8%) of the dentists had a fair knowledge about the characteristics of COVID-19. Nearly 60.7% and 49.7% of the dentists had taken infection control training and special training for COVID-19, respectively. Nearly 50% of the dentists had the perception that COVID-19 is very dangerous. Only 41.8% of the dentists were willing to provide emergency services to patients. Most of the dentists had an opinion that there is a need to enhance personal protective measures. During the survey, it was found that varied technological advances are offered to dentists to ensure good clinical practice. They also concurred that there was a need to standardize the tools and measures available to carry out dental practices. Conclusion: In the present study, Indian dentists have presented satisfactory knowledge with adequate preparedness as the majority of them had a fair level of knowledge with significantly higher knowledge among female respondents and those with post-graduation studies. Dentists should make judicious utilization of all the precautionary measures to safely practice dentistry. As we are going through an evolutionary phase where new advances are expected to evolve, dentists will definitely emerge successfully out from the crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Arora, Suraj; Saquib, Shahabe Abullais; Attar, Nilofar; Pimpale, Sandeep; Zafar, Khwaja Saifullah; Saluja, Priyanka; Abdulla, Anshad M.; Shamsuddin, Shaheen",J.

To date, April 25, 2020, more than 2.4 million humans are infected and more than a hundred thousand deaths have been reported from more than 200 countries from COVID-19. There is no evidence-based treatment for the infection and prevention of transmission using social distancing, isolation and hygiene measures is widely recommended. Tobacco smoking is rampant in communities around the globe and the addiction to tobacco results in deaths of more than 8 million individuals each year. As COVID-19 transmits through salivary droplets and causes severe lung pneumonia, tobacco smokers are also at high risk of severe COVID-19 infection due to poor lung function, cross-infection and susceptible hygiene habits. Smoking tobacco (cigarette, e-cigarettes or waterpipe) produces exhaled smoke, coughing or sneezing, aerosols containing SARS-CoV-2 in the surroundings and contaminating surfaces. Therefore, smoking tobacco is a possible mode of transmission for the virus for both active and passive smokers. Smoking should be considered a risk factor for the disease transmission until further availability of evidence and measures to limit its direct and indirect effects should be implemented within the community.","Ahmed, Naseer; Maqsood, Afsheen; Abduljabbar, Tariq; Vohra, Fahim",Pak.

Despite the recent surge of investigations about different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic, we still know little about the effects of city size on the propagation of this disease in urban areas. Here we investigate how the number of cases and deaths by COVID-19 scale with the population of Brazilian cities. Our results indicate small towns are proportionally more affected by COVID-19 during the initial spread of the disease, such that the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths per capita initially decrease with population size. However, during the long-term course of the pandemic, this urban advantage vanishes and large cities start to exhibit higher incidence of cases and deaths, such that every 1% rise in population is associated with a 0.14% increase in the number of fatalities per capita after about four months since the first two daily deaths. We argue that these patterns may be related to the existence of proportionally more health infrastructure in the largest cities and a lower proportion of older adults in large urban areas. We also find the initial growth rate of cases and deaths to be higher in large cities; however, these growth rates tend to decrease in large cities and to increase in small ones over time.","Ribeiro, Haroldo V; Sunahara, Andre S; Sutton, Jack; Perc, Matjaz; Hanley, Quentin S",PLoS One,,359
472791,Arrhythmias and COVID 19,2020,"The remodeling of stalled replication forks to form four-way DNA junctions is an important component of the replication stress response. Nascent DNA at the regressed arms of these reversed forks is protected by RAD51 and the tumor suppressors BRCA1/2, and when this function is compromised, stalled forks undergo pathological MRE11-dependent degradation, leading to chromosomal instability. However, the mechanisms regulating MRE11 functions at reversed forks are currently unclear. Here, we identify the MRE11-binding protein MRNIP as a novel fork protection factor that directly binds to MRE11 and specifically represses its exonuclease activity. The loss of MRNIP results in impaired replication fork progression, MRE11 exonuclease-dependent degradation of reversed forks, persistence of underreplicated genomic regions, chemosensitivity, and chromosome instability. Our findings identify MRNIP as a novel regulator of MRE11 at reversed forks and provide evidence that regulation of specific MRE11 nuclease activities ensures protection of nascent DNA and thereby genome integrity.","Bennett, L G; Wilkie, A M; Antonopoulou, E; Ceppi, I; Sanchez, A; Vernon, E G; Gamble, A; Myers, K N; Collis, S J; Cejka, P; Staples, C J",Sci.

Post-mortem examinations show severe endothelial injury and widespread thrombotic microangiopathy in the pulmonary vasculature. Early reports describing the use of prophylactic anticoagulation demonstrated improved survival, leading to the adoption of prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation guided by D-dimer levels. The clinical usefulness of D-dimer values, trends, and more intensive anticoagulation remains an area of clinical interest. OBJECTIVES: Assess the outcomes and laboratory trends in COVID-19 patients stratified by intensity of anticoagulation at time of admission. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Retrospectively review the differences in clinical outcomes and laboratory trends in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in the Lifespan Health System. RESULTS: Between 27 February and 24 April 2020, 468 patients were hospitalized. Initial use of high-intensity thromboprophylaxis was associated with improved 30-day mortality (adjusted RR 0.26; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.07-0.97; p = 0.045) without a significant increased rate of bleeding (p = 0.11). In severe COVID-19, D-dimer significantly increased during hospitalization with standard thromboprophylaxis (p < 0.001) but remained stable or decreased with high-intensity prophylaxis or therapeutic anticoagulation. CONCLUSION: Patients who received high-intensity prophylactic anticoagulation had a downtrend in D-dimer levels and improved 30-day mortality. This suggests a role in anticoagulation in mitigating adverse outcomes associated with COVID-19; however, further randomized, prospective studies are needed.","Hsu, Andrew; Liu, Yuchen; Zayac, Adam S; Olszewski, Adam J; Reagan, John L",Thromb Res,,359

Empirical estimates of their direct and spill-over effects however remain challenging to identify. In this study, we propose the use of a novel synthetic control framework to obtain causal estimates for direct and spill-over impacts of these events. The Sabah state elections in Malaysia were used as an example for our proposed methodology and we investigate the event's spatial and temporal impacts on COVID-19 transmission. Results indicate an estimated (i) 70.0% of COVID-19 case counts within Sabah post-state election were attributable to the election's direct effect; (ii) 64.4% of COVID-19 cases in the rest of Malaysia post-state election were attributable to the election's spill-over effects. Sensitivity analysis was further conducted by examining epidemiological pre-trends, surveillance efforts, varying synthetic control matching characteristics and spill-over specifications. We demonstrate that our estimates are not due to pre-existing epidemiological trends, surveillance efforts, and/or preventive policies. These estimates highlight the potential of mass gatherings in one region to spill-over into an outbreak of national scale. Relaxations of mass gathering restrictions must therefore be carefully considered, even in the context of low community transmission and enforcement of safe distancing guidelines.","Lim, Jue Tao; Maung, Kenwin; Tan, Sok Teng; Ong, Suan Ee; Lim, Jane Mingjie; Koo, Joel Ruihan; Sun, Haoyang; Park, Minah; Tan, Ken Wei; Yoong, Joanne; Cook, Alex R; Dickens, Borame Sue Lee",PLoS Comput Biol,,359

474864,Hand Sanitizer-Induced Ocular Injury: A COVID-19 Hazard in Children,2021,"The rooting of the SARS-CoV-2 phylogeny is important for understanding the origin and early spread of the virus. Previously published phylogenies have used different rootings that do not always provide consistent results. We investigate several different strategies for rooting the SARS-CoV-2 tree and provide measures of statistical uncertainty for all methods. We show that methods based on the molecular clock tend to place the root in the B clade, while methods based on outgroup rooting tend to place the root in the A clade. The results from the two approaches are statistically incompatible, possibly as a consequence of deviations from a molecular clock or excess back-mutations. We also show that none of the methods provide strong statistical support for the placement of the root in any particular edge of the tree. These results suggest that phylogenetic evidence alone is unlikely to identify the origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and we caution against strong inferences regarding the early spread of the virus based solely on such evidence.

Recent transformer architectures have shown great progress in language modeling and associated fine-tuned tasks, but they have yet to be adapted for drug discovery. We present a RoBERTa transformer-based method that extends the masked language token prediction using query-target conditioning to treat the specificity challenge. The transformer discovery method entails several benefits over the word2vec method including domain-specific (antiviral) analogy performance, negation handling, and flexible query analysis (specific) and is demonstrated on influenza drug discovery. To stimulate COVID-19 research, we release an influenza clinical trials and antiviral analogies dataset used in conjunction with the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19) literature dataset in the study. We examine k-shot fine-tuning to improve the downstream analogies performance as well as to mine analogies for model explainability. Further, the query-target analysis is verified in a forward chaining analysis against the influenza drug clinical trials dataset, before adapted for COVID-19 drugs (combinations and side-effects) and on-going clinical trials.

As effective vaccines and treatments begin to emerge, it will become increasingly important to identify and proactively manage the long-term respiratory complications of severe disease. The patterns of imaging abnormalities coupled with data from prior coronavirus outbreaks suggest that patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia are likely at an increased risk of progression to interstitial lung disease (ILD) and chronic pulmonary vascular disease. In this paper, we briefly review the definition, classifi-cation, and underlying pathophysiology of interstitial lung disease (ILD). We then review the current literature on the proposed mechanisms of lung injury in severe COVID-19 infection, and outline potential viral-and immune-mediated processes implicated in the development of post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis (PCPF). Finally, we address patient-specific and iatrogenic risk factors that could lead to PCPF and discuss strategies for reducing risk of pulmonary complications/sequelae.","Ambardar, S. R.; Hightower, S.

476606,Euglycemic DKA (euDKA) as a presentation of COVID-19,2020,"COVID-19 pandemic has unleashed an unprecedented humanitarian crisis in the world at present. With each passing day, the number of patients afflicted with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is rising at an alarming pace, so much so that some countries are now combating the second wave of the contagion. As the death ratio due to the Virus increases, the medical fraternity and pharmacologists are working relentlessly to identify and prescribe a standardized and effective course of treatment for treating COVID-19 patients. However, medical specialists are confused about opting for the most efficacious course of treatment because the patients infected with this virus have varied symptoms at different stages. In this league, our research study attempts to conduct an empirical analysis to identify which course of treatment is the most effective and preferred one for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. The study proposes to achieve this objective by employing a scientific computation based symmetrical methodology. The present study has adopted a well-established and highly effective Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approach named Hesitant Fuzzy Linguistic Term Sets based Analytical Hierarchy Process-Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (HFLTS-AHP-TOPSIS) Methodology. The computation based symmetrical methodology evaluates the various selected course of treatments identified through different research articles and guidelines suggested by different countries, and evaluates them on the basis of opinions suggested by medical experts (including doctors, industry experts, and others) and practitioners. Thus, the results drawn are highly corroborative and can be used as an authentic reference for future initiatives being undertaken in this domain. Our research investigation outlines a systematically assessed and scientifically validated ranking for various courses of treatments used in SARS-CoV-2 treatment and proposes to be an effective reckoner in the attempts to dispel the ambiguities surrounding the cure of SARS-CoV-2. Additionally, to authenticate the results of our analysis, we per-formed the sensitivity analysis (robustness analysis), marginal mean assessment and comparison analysis. © 2021, Tech Science Press.

One negative consequence of the ongoing pandemic is anxiety brought about by uncertainty and the COVID-19 disease. Increased anxiety is a potential risk factor for wellbeing at work. This study investigated psychological, situational, and socio-demographic predictors of COVID-19 anxiety using longitudinal data. Methods: A nationally representative sample of Finnish workers (N = 1308) was collected before and during the COVID-19 crisis. Eighty percent of the participants responded to the follow-up study (N = 1044). COVID-19 anxiety was measured with a modified Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Psychological and situational predictors included perceived loneliness, psychological distress, technostress, personality, social support received from the work community, and remote working. A number of socio-demographic factors were also investigated. Results: Perceived loneliness, psychological distress, technostress, and neuroticism were identified as robust psychological predictors of COVID-19 anxiety. Increase in psychological distress and technostress during the COVID-19 crisis predicted higher COVID-19 anxiety. A recent change in their field of work and decreased social support from work communities predicted COVID-19 anxiety. Women and young people experienced higher anxiety. Conclusions: Different factors explain workers' COVID-19 anxiety. Increased anxiety can disrupt wellbeing at work, emphasizing the organizations' role in maintaining an inclusive and caring work culture and providing technical and psychological support to workers during crisis.","Savolainen, Iina; Oksa, Reetta; Savela, Nina; Celuch, Magdalena; Oksanen, Atte",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,359

Traditionally, in-person hands-on courses have been the most common means for surgeons to gain exposure to new techniques and procedures. The COVID19 pandemic caused a cessation in these courses and left surgeons with limited opportunities to continue their professional development. Thus, SAGES elected to create an innovative hands-on course that could be completed at home in order to provide surgeons with opportunities to learn new procedures during the pandemic. METHODS: This course was initially planned to be taught as an in-person hands-on course utilizing the Acquisition of Data for Outcomes and Procedure Transfer(ADOPT) method 1. We identified a virtual telementoring platform, Proximie Ltd(London, UK), and a company that could create a model of an abdominal wall in order to perform a Transversus Abdominis Release, KindHeart&#8482;(Chapel Hill, NC, USA). The course consisted of pre-course lectures and videos to be reviewed by participants, a pre-course call to set learning goals, the hands-on telementoring session from home, and monthly webinars for a year. RESULTS: The ADOPT hands-on hernia course at home was successfully completed on October 23rd of 2020. All participants and faculty were successfully able to set up their model and utilize the telementoring platform, but 15% required assistance. Post course-surveys showed that participants felt that the course was successful in meeting their educational goals and felt similar to prior in-person courses. CONCLUSIONS: SAGES was successfully able to transition and in-person hands-on course to a virtual at-home format. This innovative approach to continuing professional development will be necessary during the times of the COVID19 pandemic, but may be a helpful option for rural surgeons and others with travel restrictions in the future to continue their professional development without the need to travel away from their practice.","Greenberg, Jacob A; Schwarz, Erin; Paige, John; Dort, Jonathan; Bachman, Sharon",Surg Endosc,,359

RECENT FINDINGS: To date, there has been little evidence to suggest that children with PRD, including those on immunomodulatory therapies, are at increased risk for severe COVID-19. Clinical guidance statements have been created to support clinical providers in providing care to children with PRD during the COVID-19 pandemic. Pediatric rheumatologists have also been called upon to assist in the identification and management of post-COVID sequelae, including the rapidly emerging inflammatory illness, MIS-C. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 era has been defined by a rapid expansion in scientific knowledge and a time of extraordinary local and worldwide collaboration, both within the pediatric rheumatology community, as well as across multiple disciplines. Through collective efforts, we have learned that children with PRD, including those on immunomodulatory therapies, are not at increased risk for severe COVID-19. Pediatric rheumatologists have also worked alongside other disciplines to develop guidance for the management of MIS-C, with the majority of patients experiencing excellent clinical outcomes.","Wahezi, Dawn M; Peskin, Malki; Tanner, Tamara",Curr Opin Rheumatol,,359
482763,COVID-19 Vaccine Prioritisation for Medical Students: The Forgotten Cohort?,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 epidemic may elevate mental distress and depressive symptoms in various populations in China. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the levels of depression and mental distress due to COVID-19, and the associations between cognitive, behavioral, and psychosocial factors, and depression and mental distress due to COVID-19 among university students in China. METHODS: A large-scale online cross-sectional study (16 cities in 13 provinces) was conducted among university students from February 1 to 10, 2020, in China; 23,863 valid questionnaires were returned. The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 was used to assess depression. Structural equation modeling was performed to test mediation and suppression effects. RESULTS: Of the 23,863 participants, 47.1% (n=11,235) reported high or very high levels of one or more types of mental distress due to COVID-19; 39.1% (n=9326) showed mild to severe depression. Mental distress due to COVID-19 was positively associated with depression. All but one factor (perceived infection risks, perceived chance of controlling the epidemic, staying at home, contacted people from Wuhan, and perceived discrimination) were significantly associated with mental distress due to COVID-19 and depression. Mental distress due to COVID-19 partially mediated and suppressed the associations between some of the studied factors and depression (effect size of 6.0%-79.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Both mental distress due to COVID-19 and depression were prevalent among university students in China; the former may have increased the prevalence of the latter. The studied cognitive, behavioral, and psychosocial factors related to COVID-19 may directly or indirectly (via mental distress due to COVID-19) affect depression. Interventions to modify such factors may reduce mental distress and depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 epidemic.","Yu, Yanqiu; She, Rui; Luo, Sitong; Xin, Meiqi; Li, Lijuan; Wang, Suhua; Ma, Le; Tao, Fangbiao; Zhang, Jianxin; Zhao, Junfeng; Li, Liping; Hu, Dongsheng; Zhang, Guohua; Gu, Jing; Lin, Danhua; Wang, Hongmei; Cai, Yong; Wang, Zhaofen; You, Hua; Hu, Guoqing; Lau, Joseph Tak-Fai",JMIR Ment Health,,359
482808,Covid-19: Highest risk patients are asked to stay at home for 12 weeks,2020,"Pandemic COVID-19 is a contagious disease affecting more than 200 countries, territories, and regions. Recently, Iraq is one of the countries that have immensely suffered from this outbreak. The Kurdistan Region of Iraq (KRI) is also prone to the disease. Until now, more than 23,000 confirmed cases have been recorded in the region. Since the onset of the COVID-19 in Wuhan, based on epidemiological modelling, researchers have used various models to predict the future of the epidemic and the time of peak, yielding diverse numbers in different countries. This study aims to estimate the basic reproductive number [R0] for COVID-19 in KRI, using the standard SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) epidemic model. A system of nonlinear differential equations was formulated and solved numerically by the 4th order Runge-Kutta method. The reproductive numbers R0 was estimated by the method of fitting the curves between the actual daily data and numerical solution by applying the least square method. For the analysis, data were taken for the duration of 165 days, from 1st of March to 12th August 2020, in a population of 5.2 million. It is concluded that the R0 value was fluctuating during the outbreak, with an average of 1.33, predicting that infection cases will reach their maximum value of around 540,000 on the 5th of November 2020.

483201,Why Do Women Report Lower Intentions to Get Vaccinated against COVID-19? the Mediating Role of Variables from the TPB and HBM (preprint),2021,"The widespread diffusion of electric mobility requires a contextual expansion of the charging infrastructure. An extended collection and processing of information regarding charging of electric vehicles may turn each electric vehicle charging station into a valuable source of streaming data. Charging point operators may profit from all these data for optimizing their operation and planning activities. In such a scenario, big data and machine learning techniques would allow valorizing real-time data coming from electric vehicle charging stations. This paper presents an architecture able to deal with data streams from a charging infrastructure, with the final aim to forecast electric charging station availability after a set amount of minutes from present time. Both batch data regarding past charges and real-time data streams are used to train a streaming logistic regression model, to take into account recurrent past situations and unexpected actual events. The streaming model performs better than a model trained only using historical data. The results highlight the importance of constantly updating the predictive model parameters in order to adapt to changing conditions and always provide accurate forecasts.","Soldan, Francesca; Bionda, Enea; Mauri, Giuseppe; Celaschi, Silvia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12503v1.pdf,359

Specifically, we question: (1) Do the international healthcare resources adequately meet the needs of adolescents who are living and studying outside their home country? (2) Is a Western framework of medicine being imposed on non-Western cultures? (3) Can student health regulations, best practices, and policies be implemented at an international level?

Su repercusión cardiovascular. una revisión,2020,"BACKGROUND: The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic poses a threat to societies' mental health. This study examined the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms and identified the factors contributing to psychological impact in the Philippines. METHODS: A total of 1879 completed online surveys were gathered from March 28-April 12, 2020. Collected data included socio-demographics, health status, contact history, COVID-19 knowledge and concerns, precautionary measures, information needs, the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) ratings. RESULTS: The IES-R mean score was 19.57 (SD=13.12) while the DASS-21 mean score was 25.94 (SD=20.59). In total, 16.3% of respondents rated the psychological impact of the outbreak as moderate-to-severe; 16.9% reported moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms; 28.8% had moderate-to-severe anxiety levels; and 13.4% had moderate-to-severe stress levels. Female gender; youth age; single status; students; specific symptoms; recent imposed quarantine; prolonged home-stay; and reports of poor health status, unnecessary worry, concerns for family members, and discrimination were significantly associated with greater psychological impact of the pandemic and higher levels of stress, anxiety and depression (p<0.05). Adequate health information, having grown-up children, perception of good health status and confidence in doctors' abilities were significantly associated with lesser psychological impact of the pandemic and lower levels of stress, anxiety and depression (p<0.05). LIMITATIONS: An English online survey was used. CONCLUSION: During the early phase of the pandemic in the Philippines, one-fourth of respondents reported moderate-to-severe anxiety and one-sixth reported moderate-to-severe depression and psychological impact. The factors identified can be used to devise effective psychological support strategies.","Tee, Michael L; Tee, Cherica A; Anlacan, Joseph P; Aligam, Katrina Joy G; Reyes, Patrick Wincy C; Kuruchittham, Vipat; Ho, Roger C",J Affect Disord,,359

However, not all recovered patients develop adequate antibody titers for donation and the relationship between avidity and neutralizing titers is currently not well understood. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 anti-spike and anti-nucleocapsid IgG titers and avidity were measured in a longitudinal cohort of COVID-19 hospitalized patients (nâ =â 16 individuals) and a cross-sectional sample of convalescent plasma donors (nâ =â 130). Epidemiologic correlates of avidity were examined in donors by linear regression. The association of avidity and a high neutralizing titer (NT) were also assessed in donors using modified Poisson regression. RESULTS: Antibody avidity increased over duration of infection and remained elevated. In convalescent plasma donors, higher levels of anti-spike avidity were associated with older age, male sex, and hospitalization. Higher NTs had a stronger positive correlation with anti-spike IgG avidity (Spearman &#961; = 0.386; Pâ <â .001) than with anti-nucleocapsid IgG avidity (Spearman &#961; = 0.211; Pâ =â .026). Increasing levels of anti-spike IgG avidity were associated with high NT (&#8805;160) (adjusted prevalence ratioâ =â 1.58 [95% confidence intervalâ =â 1.19-2.12]), independent of age, sex, and hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 antibody avidity correlated with duration of infection and higher neutralizing titers, suggesting a potential alternative screening parameter for identifying optimal convalescent plasma donors.","Benner, Sarah E; Patel, Eshan U; Laeyendecker, Oliver; Pekosz, Andrew; Littlefield, Kirsten; Eby, Yolanda; Fernandez, Reinaldo E; Miller, Jernelle; Kirby, Charles S; Keruly, Morgan; Klock, Ethan; Baker, Owen R; Schmidt, Haley A; Shrestha, Ruchee; Burgess, Imani; Bonny, Tania S; Clarke, William; Caturegli, Patrizio; Sullivan, David; Shoham, Shmuel; Quinn, Thomas C; Bloch, Evan M; Casadevall, Arturo; Tobian, Aaron A R; Redd, Andrew D",J Infect Dis,,359

Does seroconversion mean immunity?,2021,"The year 2020 has seen a major and sustained outbreak of a novel betacoronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus (CoV)-2) infection that causes fever, severe respiratory illness and pneumonia, a disease called COVID-19. At the time of writing, the death toll was greater than 120 000 worldwide with more than 2 million documented infections. The genome of the CoV encodes a number of structural proteins that facilitate cellular entry and assembly of virions, of which the spike protein S appears to be critical for cellular entry. The spike protein guides the virus to attach to the host cell. The spike protein contains a receptor-binding domain (RBD), a fusion domain and a transmembrane domain. The RBD of spike protein S binds to Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) to initiate cellular entry. The spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 shows more than 90% amino acid similarity to the pangolin and bat CoVs and these also use ACE2 as a receptor. Binding of the spike protein to ACE2 exposes the cleavage sites to cellular proteases. Cleavage of the spike protein by transmembrane protease serine 2 and other cellular proteases initiates fusion and endocytosis. The spike protein contains an addition furin cleavage site that may allow it to be 'preactivated' and highly infectious after replication. The fundamental role of the spike protein in infectivity suggests that it is an important target for vaccine development, blocking therapy with antibodies and diagnostic antigen-based tests. This review briefly outlines the structure and function of the 2019 novel CoV/SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S.","Pillay, Tahir S",J Clin Pathol,,359

The aim of this study was to learn how COVID-19 influenced patients suffering from IBD during the quarantine period, focusing in particular on psychological distress through the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10) and also the impact of the pandemic on therapeutic adherence using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A prospective, single-centre and analytical observational study was carried out in the IBD unit in August 2020. Patients were contacted and interviewed by phone. A descriptive analysis was carried out and subsequently the factors associated with the loss of therapeutic adherence and higher-moderate levels of stress were analyzed through logistic regression multivariate analyses. RESULTS: A total of 426 patients were included with a median PSS-10 score of 12 (10-16). A higher level of stress was reported by those who were not married, women and those who experienced an increase in IBD-related symptoms. Adherence to treatment was not associated with stress based on the PSS-10 questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: Although the lockdown period due to the COVID-19 pandemic has probably had a significant emotional impact on Spaniards with IBD, IBD patients in general had lower PSS-10 scores.","Refaie, Engy; Mateo, Sandra García; Domínguez, Samuel Jesús Martínez; Gargallo-Puyuelo, Carla Jerusalén; Quilez, Laura Lario; Carrera-Lasfuentes, Patricia; Villarino, María Teresa Arroyo; García, Fernando Gomollón",Gastroenterol. hepatol.

Drawing on terror management theory, we develop and test a model that explains how COVID-19-triggered mortality salience influences employees' state anxiety and their responses at and outside work. We conducted an experience sampling method study using employees from an information technology firm in China when COVID-19 was surging there and two experiments using employees from a variety of industries in the United States when it became a new epicenter of the global outbreak. Results from 3 studies largely supported our theoretical hypotheses. Specifically, our research showed that mortality salience concerning COVID-19 was positively related to employees' state anxiety (general anxiety in Study 1 and Study 2 and death-specific anxiety in Study 3). Our studies also found that servant leadership is particularly crucial in guiding employees with state anxiety associated with COVID-19 mortality salience to be engaged in their jobs and to contribute more to the broader community. Our findings offer timely, valuable implications for theory and practice. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).","Hu, Jia; He, Wei; Zhou, Kong",J Appl Psychol,,359

METHODS: Excess mortality due to COVID-19 was estimated directly based on various data sources, and indirectly, based on the difference between the observed and expected number of deaths from serious acute respiratory infection (SARI) and all natural causes in 2020 had there been no COVID-19. The absence of laboratory testing for SARS-CoV-2 was adjusted based on the proportion of those who tested positive among the tested individuals whose death was attributed to COVID-19. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (lasso) was used to improve prediction of likely mortality without COVID-19 in 2020. RESULTS: Under-reporting of COVID-19 deaths was 22.62%, with a corresponding mortality rate per 100000 inhabitants of 115 by the direct method, 71-76 by the indirect methods based on the excess SARI mortality, and 95-104 by excess mortality due to natural causes. COVID-19 was the third cause of mortality that contributed directly with 18%, and indirectly with additional 10-11% to all deaths in Brazil in 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Underestimation of COVID-19 mortality between 1:5 and 1:4 is likely its lower bound.

Drawing from procedural justice theory, this study explored accounts of unlawful use of force, human rights violations, and other police misconducts that resulted from the enforcement of COVID-19 measures. Using a victim-centred approach involving qualitative, in-depth interviews with 71 people, who perceived their encounters with the police enforcing COVID-19 measures as bordering on their rights, were conducted, and a thematic analysis of the narratives carried out. Participants reported significant variety of police aggression directed towards them: including actual threats of physical violence, hostility, intimidation, extortion, and punishment. Female participants reported incidents of sexual harassment, unwanted sexual advances, and assault. The study concludes that the militarized option adopted by the police to enforce COVID-19 measures drew deeper divides between the police and communities than previously existed. This stresses the need for Nigeria police to train officers, reprimand erring officers, and deploy procedural justice principles in enforcing COVID-19 measures.","Aborisade, Richard A",J Police Crim Psychol,,359

In this paper, we show how medical genetics department's activity, in our tertiary pediatric hospital, has changed due to pandemic. METHODS: We stratified all our scheduled visits, from March 9th through April 30th, and assessed case-by-case which genetic consultations should be maintained as face-to-face visit, or postponed/switched to telemedicine. RESULTS: Out of 288 scheduled appointments, 60 were prenatal consultations and 228 were postnatal visits. We performed most of prenatal consultations as face-to-face visits, as women would have been present in the hospital to perform other procedures in addition to our consult. As for postnatal care, we suspended all outpatient first visits and opted for telemedicine for selected follow-up consultations: interestingly, 75% of our patients' parents revealed that they would have cancelled the appointment themselves for the fear to contract an infection. CONCLUSIONS: Spread of COVID-19 in Italy forced us to change our working habits. Given the necessity to optimize healthcare resources and minimize the risk of in-hospital infections, we experienced the benefits of telegenetics. Current pandemic made us familiar with telemedicine, laying the foundations for its application to deal with the increasing number of requests in clinical genetics.","Pagliazzi, Angelica; Mancano, Giorgia; Forzano, Giulia; di Giovanni, Fabiana; Gori, Giulia; Traficante, Giovanna; Iolascon, Achille; Giglio, Sabrina",Mol Genet Genomic Med,,359

490908,What Predicts Desire to Proceed with Fertility Treatment during a Pandemic? a Retrospective Cohort Study following the Covid-19 Shutdown,2020,"The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is wreaking havoc on society, especially health-care systems, including disrupting bariatric and metabolic surgery. The current limitations on accessibility to non-urgent care undermine postoperative monitoring of patients who have undergone such operations. Furthermore, like most elective surgery, new bariatric and metabolic procedures are being postponed worldwide during the pandemic. When the outbreak abates, a backlog of people seeking these operations will exist. Hence, surgical candidates face prolonged delays of beneficial treatment. Because of the progressive nature of obesity and diabetes, delaying surgery increases risks for morbidity and mortality, thus requiring strategies to mitigate harm. The risk of harm, however, varies among patients, depending on the type and severity of their comorbidities. A triaging strategy is therefore needed. The traditional weight-centric patient-selection criteria do not favour cases based on actual clinical needs.

Where are we going?],2020,"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] infection in patients with chronic liver disease [CLD] may precipitate acute-on-chronic liver failure [ACLF]. In a large multi-center cohort of COVID-19-infected patients, we aim to analyze (1) the outcomes of patients with underlying CLD [with and without cirrhosis] and (2) the development and impact of ACLF on in-hospital mortality. DESIGN: We identified 192 adults with CLD from among 10,859 patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection (admitted to any of 12 hospitals in a New York health care system between March 1, 2020 and April 27, 2020). ACLF was defined using the EASL-CLIF Consortium definition. Patient follow-up was through April 30, 2020, or until the date of discharge, transfer, or death. RESULTS: Of the 84 patients with cirrhosis, 32 [38%] developed ACLF, with respiratory failure [39%] and renal failure [26%] being the most common. Hispanic/Latino ethnicity was particularly at higher risk of in-hospital mortality [adjusted HR 4.92, 95% 1.27-19.09, p < 0.02] in cirrhosis despite having lower risk of development of ACLF [HR 0.26, 95% CI 0.08-0.89, p = 0.03]. Hypertension on admission predicted development of ACLF [HR 3.46, 95% CI 1.12-10.75, p = 0.03]. In-hospital mortality was not different between CLD patients with or without cirrhosis [p = 0.24] but was higher in those with cirrhosis who developed ACLF [adjusted HR 9.06, 95% CI 2.63-31.12, p < 0.001] with a trend for increased mortality by grade of ACLF [p = 0.002]. There was no difference in in-hospital mortality between the CLD cohort compared to matched control without CLD (log rank, p = 0.98) and between the cirrhosis cohort compared to matched control without cirrhosis (log rank, p = 0.51). CONCLUSION: Development of ACLF is the main driver of increased in-hospital mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 infection and cirrhosis.","Satapathy, Sanjaya K; Roth, Nitzan C; Kvasnovsky, Charlotte; Hirsch, Jamie S; Trindade, Arvind J; Molmenti, Ernesto; Barish, Matthew; Hirschwerk, David; Da, Ben L; Bernstein, David",Hepatol. int.

Purpose To perform a longitudinal study to analyze the serial CT findings over time in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia. Materials and Methods During January 16 to February 17, 2020, 90 patients (33 men, 57 women; mean age, 45 years) with COVID-19 pneumonia were prospectively enrolled and followed up until being discharged, death, or the end of the study. A total of 366 CT scans were acquired and reviewed by two groups of radiologists for the patterns and distribution of lung abnormalities, total CT scores, and number of zones involved. Those features were analyzed for temporal change. Results CT scores and number of zones involved progressed rapidly, peaked during illness days 6-11 (median CT score, 5; median number of zones involved, five), and were followed by persistence of high levels. The predominant pattern of abnormalities after symptom onset was ground-glass opacity (35 of 78 scans [45%] to 49 of 79 scans [62%] in different periods). The percentage of mixed pattern peaked on illness days 12-17 (30 of 78 scans [38%]) and became the second most predominant pattern thereafter. Pure ground-glass opacity was the most prevalent subtype of ground-glass opacity after symptom onset (20 of 50 scans [40%] to 20 of 28 scans [71%]). The percentage of ground-glass opacity with irregular linear opacity peaked on illness days 6-11 (14 of 50 scans [28%]) and became the second most prevalent subtype thereafter. The distribution of lesions was predominantly bilateral and subpleural. Sixty-six of the 70 patients discharged (94%) had residual disease on final CT scans (median CT score, 4; median number of zones involved, four), with ground-glass opacity (42 of 70 patients [60%]) and pure ground-glass opacity (31 of 42 patients [74%]) the most common pattern and subtype. Conclusion The extent of lung abnormalities at CT peaked during illness days 6-11. The temporal changes of the diverse CT manifestations followed a specific pattern, which might indicate the progression and recovery of the illness. © RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article.","Wang, Yuhui; Dong, Chengjun; Hu, Yue; Li, Chungao; Ren, Qianqian; Zhang, Xin; Shi, Heshui; Zhou, Min",Radiology,,359
491981,Covid tests in secondary schools: A statistical cause célèbre,2021,"The article identifies the features of financial management in international economic activity in terms of limiting economic relations associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. It is clear that the current state of the economy requires the spread of international economic activity at both macro and micro levels, as only provided that the integrated system of economic relations between the national economies of different countries and the benefits of international cooperation, it is possible to avoid economic and social problems associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. It is noted that Ukraine's active participation in world economic processes requires economy. In turn, the transformation processes in Ukraine require a clear coordination of actions in all areas and parts of the financial system, which is the conceptual basis of a new model of economic and social development of the state. Such a model should combine the constant improvement of the welfare of society and every citizen and the formation of a competitive national economy in Ukraine, which would be organically integrated into global economic processes and take a worthy place in them. It is determined that Ukraine's international economic activity has a very great potential in the development of economic relations, despite the existing problems, the solution of which is the key to future success in the development of trade in the international market. A SWOT-analysis of Ukraine's international economic activity was conducted, which revealed trends in the development of foreign economic activity. The financial mechanism of development of the international economic activity (IEC) which is an element of management and the regulator of foreign economic relations is offered. The concept of IEC financial management is proposed, which substantiates the purpose and main tasks, which are specified at the micro and macro levels. It is concluded that many problems of financial management in international economic activity should be addressed primarily at the macro level, i.e. public institutions.","Fedotova, Y.; Volkova, M.; Naumov, M.; Burmaka, T.; Serogina, D.",Financial and Credit Activity-Problems of Theory and Practice,,359
492137,Understanding Politics via Contextualized Discourse Processing,2020-12-31,"Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) may lead to hypoxemia, requiring intensive care in many patients. Awake prone positioning (PP) is reported to improve oxygenation and is a relatively safe modality. We performed a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the available evidence and performed meta-analysis of the effect of awake PP in non-intubated patients on improvement in oxygenation and reducing the need for intubation. We searched the PubMed and EMBASE databases to identify studies using awake PP as a therapeutic strategy in the management of COVID-19. Studies were included if they reported respiratory outcomes and included five or more subjects. The quality of individual studies was assessed by the Qualsyst tool. A meta-analysis was performed to estimate the proportion of patients requiring intubation. The degree of improvement in oxygenation parameters (PaO2: FiO2 or PaO2 or SpO2) was also calculated. Sixteen studies (seven prospective trials, three before-after studies, six retrospective series) were selected for review. The pooled proportion of patients who required mechanical ventilation was 0.25 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.16-0.34). There was a significant improvement in PaO2: FiO2 ratio, PaO2, and SpO2 during awake PP. To conclude, there is limited evidence to support the efficacy of awake PP for the management of hypoxemia in COVID-19. Further RCTs are required to study the impact of awake PP on key parameters like avoidance of mechanical ventilation, length of stay, and mortality.","Pb, S.; Mittal, S.; Madan, K.; Mohan, A.; Tiwari, P.; Hadda, V.; Pandey, R.

492751,Prolonged confusional state as first manifestation of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Regulation of sodium chloride transport in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron is essential for fluid homeostasis and BP control. The chloride-bicarbonate exchanger pendrin in ß-intercalated cells, along with sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC) in distal convoluted tubules, complementarily regulate sodium chloride handling, which is controlled by the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. METHODS: Using mice with mineralocorticoid receptor deletion in intercalated cells, we examined the mechanism and roles of pendrin upregulation via mineralocorticoid receptor in two different models of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activation. We also used aldosterone-treated NCC knockout mice to examine the role of pendrin regulation in salt-sensitive hypertension. RESULTS: Deletion of mineralocorticoid receptor in intercalated cells suppressed the increase in renal pendrin expression induced by either exogenous angiotensin II infusion or endogenous angiotensin II upregulation via salt restriction. When fed a low-salt diet, intercalated cell-specific mineralocorticoid receptor knockout mice with suppression of pendrin upregulation showed BP reduction that was attenuated by compensatory activation of NCC. In contrast, upregulation of pendrin induced by aldosterone excess combined with a high-salt diet was scarcely affected by deletion of mineralocorticoid receptor in intercalated cells, but depended instead on hypokalemic alkalosis through the activated mineralocorticoid receptor-epithelial sodium channel cascade in principal cells. In aldosterone-treated NCC knockout mice showing upregulation of pendrin, potassium supplementation corrected alkalosis and inhibited the pendrin upregulation, thereby lowering BP. CONCLUSIONS: In conjunction with NCC, the two pathways of pendrin upregulation, induced by angiotensin II through mineralocorticoid receptor activation in intercalated cells and by alkalosis through mineralocorticoid receptor activation in principal cells, play important roles in fluid homeostasis during salt depletion and salt-sensitive hypertension mediated by aldosterone excess.","Ayuzawa, Nobuhiro; Nishimoto, Mitsuhiro; Ueda, Kohei; Hirohama, Daigoro; Kawarazaki, Wakako; Shimosawa, Tatsuo; Marumo, Takeshi; Fujita, Toshiro",J Am Soc Nephrol,,359

493209,COVID-19 and the dental damage stage: a comment,2021,"Background: People of minority ethnic backgrounds may be disproportionately affected by severe COVID-19. Whether this relates to increased infection risk, more severe disease progression, or worse in-hospital survival is unknown. The contribution of comorbidities or socioeconomic deprivation to ethnic patterning of outcomes is also unclear. Methods: We conducted a case-control and a cohort study in an inner city primary and secondary care setting to examine whether ethnic background affects the risk of hospital admission with severe COVID-19 and/or in-hospital mortality. Inner city adult residents admitted to hospital with confirmed COVID-19 (n = 872 cases) were compared with 3,488 matched controls randomly sampled from a primary healthcare database comprising 344,083 people residing in the same region. For the cohort study, we studied 1827 adults consecutively admitted with COVID-19. The primary exposure variable was self-defined ethnicity. Analyses were adjusted for socio-demographic and clinical variables. Findings: The 872 cases comprised 48.1% Black, 33.7% White, 12.6% Mixed/Other and 5.6% Asian patients. In conditional logistic regression analyses, Black and Mixed/Other ethnicity were associated with higher admission risk than white (OR 3.12 [95% CI 2.63-3.71] and 2.97 [2.30-3.85] respectively). Adjustment for comorbidities and deprivation modestly attenuated the association (OR 2.24 [1.83-2.74] for Black, 2.70 [2.03-3.59] for Mixed/Other). Asian ethnicity was not associated with higher admission risk (adjusted OR 1.01 [0.70-1.46]). In the cohort study of 1827 patients, 455 (28.9%) died over a median (IQR) of 8 (4-16) days. Age and male sex, but not Black (adjusted HR 1.06 [0.82-1.37]) or Mixed/Other ethnicity (adjusted HR 0.72 [0.47-1.10]), were associated with in-hospital mortality. Asian ethnicity was associated with higher in-hospital mortality but with a large confidence interval (adjusted HR 1.71 [1.15-2.56]). Interpretation: Black and Mixed ethnicity are independently associated with greater admission risk with COVID-19 and may be risk factors for development of severe disease, but do not affect in-hospital mortality risk. Comorbidities and socioeconomic factors only partly account for this and additional ethnicity-related factors may play a large role. The impact of COVID-19 may be different in Asians.

We also performed a bridging study comparing the RealTime SARS-CoV-2 assay with the new Abbott Alinity m SARS-CoV-2 assay. A number of standards, reference materials, and commercially available controls were used for the analytical verification to confirm the limit of detection, linearity, and reproducibility. We used nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens collected in saline for the clinical verification and bridging studies. Overall, we found 91.2% positive percent agreement (PPA; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 76.2 to 98.14%) and a 100% negative percent agreement (NPA; 95% CI = 97.97 to 100%) between the results of the RealTime SARS-CoV-2 and CDC tests with 217 NP specimens (P = 0.13). We found a PPA of 100% (95% CI = 90.26 to 100%) and an NPA of 95.15% (95% CI = 83.47 to 99.4%) between the results of the RealTime and TaqPath tests with 77 NP specimens (P = 0.24). Finally, we tested 203 NP swab specimens for SARS-CoV-2 on the m2000 on the Alinity m systems.

494490,A critical review of outcomes of cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"A logical strategy to contain the Covid-19 pandemic is to completely isolate everyone for 2 weeks (the incubation period of the virus). However, such a strategy can have prohibitive economic and social costs and, therefore, will be difficult to implement. At the same time, the current situation is leading to an expanding humanitarian, health and economic crisis. Based on principles of the Theory of Constraints, we propose in this article the ""Shutting-down Transmission Of Pandemic"" (STOP Covid-19) plan that would reliably contain the pandemic, mitigate its economic consequences, and boost societal confidence. This plan requires the implementation of four strategies over 90 days: (a) stop all international, domestic passenger air and intercity bus/train travel; (b) create administrative zones of about 1 million people; (c) stop all non-emergency cross-zonal travel except for transportation of goods, and (d) deploy an information-driven service value chain to control the spread of the pandemic within a zone.","Baveja, Alok; Kapoor, Ajai; Melamed, Benjamin",Ann Oper Res,,359

The present study was conducted for the path analysis of the relationship among fear and anxiety caused by coronavirus, pregnancy experience, and the mental health of pregnant women. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted on 222 pregnant women who were referred to Kamali Hospital in Alborz province in 2020. The eligible individuals entered the study through convenience sampling, and data were collected using five questionnaires including the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the Anxiety of COVID-19 Scale, the pregnancy experiences Scales, Depression Anxiety Stress scale, and demographic checklist. The obtained data were then analyzed using SPSS-16 and Amos software. RESULTS: According to results of the path analysis, the anxiety of COVID-19 and concerns during pregnancy were variables that were positively and significantly correlated with mental health only through one path, which was direct, and anxiety of COVID-19 had also the highest positive direct correlation among them (B = 0.32). The next variable was the happiness during pregnancy experiencing, which had a significantly negative and direct correlation with mental health disorder (B = 0.29). Moreover, fear of COVID-19 through the mediating concerns of pregnancy experiences was shown to have a significant positive relationship with mental health through an indirect path (B = 0.05). CONCLUSION: Based on the result of this study, it is necessary to pay more attention to the mental health of pregnant women during a pandemic.

495272,A modelling analysis of the effectiveness of second wave COVID-19 response strategies in Australia,2021,"History shows that pandemics can catalyse enormous change, fundamentally transforming the way people make sense of the world. Technologies can also be catalysts of change. While digital technologies are playing a vital role in tackling the covid-19 pandemic, the pandemic also presents a significant opportunity for digital technologies. Some experts believe the pandemic may permanently normalise the comprehensive societal use of digital technologies. This article casts a critical eye over the potential implications of this opportunity in the context of information systems (IS) research and development. We introduce and outline selected principles of Zygmunt Bauman's theory of liquid modernity. We then apply the liquid-modern principles to illustrative examples drawn from the covid-19 literature by focussing on three areas of established information systems interest: control, big data and information privacy. We show that traditional conceptualisations of scientific and societal order and control need to be reassessed; that big data alone cannot order clear and safe paths out of the current crisis and that information privacy regulations are irrelevant when undermined or circumvented by public and private actors. We conclude by making four recommendations for IS pandemic researchers and five practical recommendations in the context of the pandemic.","Doyle, Ronan; Conboy, Kieran",Int J Inf Manage,,359

With the COVID-19 pandemic, the opportunity for adoption of novel technology is more relevant. The aims are to assess the technology available, to understand the current evidence regarding the benefit and to consider challenges to implementation in clinical practice. Methods & results PRISMA guidelines were used to filter the literature. Of 1004 articles returned the following exclusion criteria were applied: 1) reviews/commentaries 2) unrelated to orthopaedic surgery 3) use of other AR wearables beyond visual aids leaving 42 papers for review. This review illustrates benefits including enhanced accuracy and reduced time of surgery, reduced radiation exposure and educational benefits. Conclusion Whilst there are obstacles to overcome, there are already reports of technology being used. As with all novel technologies, a greater understanding of the learning curve is crucial, in addition to shielding our patients from this learning curve. Improvements in usability and implementing surgeons’ specific needs should increase uptake.","Ha, Joon Parekh Priya Gamble David Masters James Jun Peter Hester Thomas Daniels Timothy Halai Mansur",Journal of Clinical Orthopaedics and Trauma,,359

A number of medications have been proposed and there are ongoing clinical trials around the world to find a suitable treatment. A recent randomised control trial compared lopinavir/ritonavir with standard care among 199 patients with severe Covid-19 infection and concluded that there was no significant reduction in mortality rate with lopinavir/ritonavir. However, there are a few important lessons which may be learnt from the study apart from the statistical reduction in mortality rate. There was a numerical reduction in mortality rate, less intensive care unit stay and less complications in the lopinavir-ritonavir group. This article points out some of those important lessons with some suggestions for future clinical trials.","Owa, Adewale Bayode; Owa, Olufunke Tolulope",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,,359

We aimed to synthesize the evidence on 14 potentially low-value clinical practices in TBI care. METHODS: Using umbrella review methodology, we identified systematic reviews evaluating the effectiveness of 14 potentially low-value practices in adults with acute TBI. We present data on methodological quality (AMSTAR-2), reported effect sizes and credibility of evidence (I to IV). RESULTS: The only clinical practice with evidence of benefit was therapeutic hypothermia (credibility of evidence II to IV). However, the most recent meta-analysis on hypothermia based on high-quality trials suggested harm (credibility of evidence IV). Meta-analyses on platelet transfusion for patients on antiplatelet therapy were all consistent with harm but were statistically non-significant. For the following practices, effect estimates were consistently close to the null: CT in adults with mild TBI who are low-risk on a validated clinical decision rule; repeat CT in adults with mild TBI on anticoagulant therapy with no clinical deterioration; antibiotic prophylaxis for external ventricular drain placement; and decompressive craniectomy for refractory intracranial hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: We identified five clinical practices with evidence of lack of benefit or harm. However, evidence could not be considered to be strong for any clinical practice as effect measures were imprecise and heterogeneous, systematic reviews were often of low quality and most included studies had a high risk of bias.","Moore, Lynne; Tardif, Pier-Alexandre; Lauzier, François; Bérubé, Mélanie; Archambault, Patrick; Lamontagne, Francois; Chassé, Michael; Stelfox, Henry T; Gabbe, Belinda; Lecky, Fiona; Kortbeek, John; Lessard-Bonaventure, Paule; Truchon, Catherine; Turgeon, Alexis F",J. neurotrama,,359

At the moment there is not an available vaccine, so, scientific community is looking for strategies and drugs to implement prevention and prophylaxis. Several compounds are examined for this purpose. Glycyrrhizin, an alkaloid extracted from licorice plant (glycyrriza glabra), is one of the most studied molecules, both for its peculiar biological functions and for its pharmacological effects. This brief review aims to highlight the characteristics of glycyrrhizin for topical use on the nasal and ocular surfaces. The anti-inflammatory activity, the ability to inhibit the accumulation of ROS, the antiviral property, but, above all, the ability to bind the ACE receptor and the SARS - CoV-2 protein S in the extracellular environment make Glycyrrhizzin for topical use a compound with a high prophylactic potential for SARS - CoV - 2 infection, also due to its low cost and the absence of significant side effects.","Passali, D; Ciprandi, G; Damiani, V; De Marco, A M; Cianfrone, F; Passali, F M",J Biol Regul Homeost Agents,,359

500666,AYUSH for COVID-19 management,2020,"Anomaly detection in a surveillance scenario is an emerging and challenging field of research. For autonomous vehicles like drones or cars, it is immensely important to distinguish between normal and abnormal states in real-time to avoid/detect potential threats. But the nature and degree of abnormality may vary depending upon the actual environment and adversary. As a result, it is impractical to model all cases a priori and use supervised methods to classify. Also, an autonomous vehicle provides various data types like images and other analog or digital sensor data. In this paper, a heterogeneous system is proposed which estimates the degree of abnormality of an environment using drone-feed, analyzing real-time image and IMU sensor data in an unsupervised manner. Here, we have demonstrated AngleNet (a novel CNN architecture) to estimate the angle between a normal image and another image under consideration, which provides us with a measure of anomaly. Moreover, the IMU data are used in clustering models to predict abnormality. Finally, the results from these two algorithms are ensembled to estimate the final abnormality. The proposed method performs satisfactorily on the IEEE SP Cup-2020 dataset with an accuracy of 99.92%. Additionally, we have also tested this approach on an in-house dataset to validate its robustness.","Chowdhury, Sayeed Shafayet; Islam, Kazi Mejbaul; Noor, Rouhan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.03733v1.pdf,359

The study aims to assess the effectiveness of mitigation strategies implemented to effectively prevent the invasion and spread of the virus. METHOD: Conduct a status analysis in accordance with the Healthcare Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (HFMEA) 4-step model, construct a response workflow, confirm the failure mode and potential causes, perform hazard matrix analysis and decision tree analysis, and formulate risk control management measures. RESULTS: For the 4 main processes and 9 subprocesses of the accompanying carers and contract caregivers entering the hospital, 26 potential failure modes and 42 potential causes of failure were analyzed. Following implementing improvement measures including strategies targeting the accompanying person, mitigation workflow failure rates decreased from 42 to 13 items, the pass rate for the maximum body temperature cutoff increased from 53.1% to 90.8%, and the compliance rate of hand washing increased from 89.5% to 100%. CONCLUSION: The HFMEA model can effectively implement preventive risk assessment and workflow management of high-risk medical procedures. The model can adjudicate the health of hospital visitors during the epidemic/pandemic, provide epidemic/pandemic education training and preventive measure health education guidance for hospital visits, and improve their epidemic prevention cognition. When combined, these strategies can prevent nosocomial infection to achieve the best anti-epidemic effect.","Tiao, Chi-Hui; Tsai, Ling-Chin; Chen, Li-Chin; Liao, Yu-Mei; Sun, Li-Chen",,,359

Pregnant women are particularly affected by this disease. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study are to assess the levels of perceived threat (susceptibility, severity, impact), negative emotions (fear, worry), and self-efficacy of pregnant women in China related to COVID-19 and to examine their associations with mental health (depression and anxiety) and personal protective behavior (wearing a face mask). METHODS: A total of 4087 pregnant women from China completed a cross-sectional web-based survey between March 3 and 10, 2020. RESULTS: The prevalence of probable depression and anxiety was 48.7% (1989/4087) and 33.0% (1347/4087), respectively; 23.8% participants (974/4087) reported always wearing a face mask when going out. Of the 4087 participants, 32.1% (1313) and 36.4% (1490) perceived themselves or their family members to be susceptible to COVID-19 infection, respectively; 3216-3518 (78.7%-86.1%) agreed the disease would have various severe consequences. Additionally, 2275 of the 4087 participants (55.7%) showed self-efficacy in protecting themselves from contracting COVID-19, and 2232 (54.6%) showed efficacy in protecting their family members; 1303 (31.9%) reported a high level of fear of the disease, and 2780-3056 (68.0%-74.8%) expressed worry about various aspects of COVID-19. The results of the multivariate multinominal logistic regression analyses showed that perceived severity, perceived impact, fear, and worry were risk factors for probable depression and anxiety, while self-efficacy was a protective factor. The results of the multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that perceived susceptibility was associated with always wearing a face mask. CONCLUSIONS: Chinese pregnant women showed high levels of mental distress but low levels of personal protective behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions are needed to promote the mental health and health behavior of pregnant women during the pandemic.","Mo, Phoenix Kit Han; Fong, Vivian Wai In; Song, Bo; Di, Jiangli; Wang, Qian; Wang, Linhong",J Med Internet Res,,359

503957,Facilitating resilience in the return to surgical practice,2020,"RATIONALE: Common human alphacoronaviruses and rhinoviruses (HRV) induce IFN I/III responses important to limiting viral propagation in the airway epithelium. In contrast, highly pathogenic human betacoronaviruses (e.g. SARS-CoV, circa 2002) may evade or antagonize RNA-induced IFN I/III responses. Aim: 1) Compare IFN I/III responses by bronchial AECs from children and adults between infection with SARS CoV2 and HRV-16. 2) Determine if pre-infection of AEC cultures with HRV-16, or pretreatment with IFN-β or IFN-λ, modifies SARS-CoV-2 replication. Methods: Bronchial AECs from children and adults (n=15;ages 8-75 yrs.) were differentiated ex vivo at an air-liquid interface to generate organotypic cultures. In a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3) facility, cultures were infected with SARS-CoV-2 isolate USA-WA1/2020 or HRV-16 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.5. At 96 hrs. following infection, RNA and protein were isolated. Expression of IFNB1, IFNL2, and interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) IFITM1, IFITM3, and OAS1 was measured by qPCR in SARS-CoV-2-infected, HRV-16-infected, and uninfected AEC cultures. In additional experiments AECs were pre-infected with HRV-16 (MOI=0.5), or pre-treated with recombinant IFN-β1 (1ng/mL in media) or IFN-λ2 (10ng/mL), 72 hrs. before SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recombinant IFNs were refreshed with each media change. SARS-CoV-2 replication was assessed by qPCR, and quantified as viral copy number/ng RNA. Results: SARS-CoV-2 induced less robust increases then HRV-16 in expression of IFNB1 (median 1.4-fold increase, 95% CI 1.2-1.7, vs. 3.8-fold, 95% CI 2.3-6.6, p&lt;0.01), IFNL2 (median 11-fold increase, 95% CI 3-17, vs. 23-fold, 95% CI 12-62, p&lt;0.01), IFITM1 (median 3-fold increase, 95% CI 1.8-5.4, vs. 6.8-fold, 95% CI 3.9-16, p=0.001), IFITM3 (median 1.6-fold increase, 95% CI 1.2-2, vs. 2.5-fold, 95% CI 2.2-4, p=0.003), and OAS1 (median 1.9-fold increase, 95% CI 1.4-3.5, vs. 3.8-fold, 95% CI 2.8-7.8, p&lt;0.001). SARS-CoV-2 replication was significantly reduced when AECs were pre-infected with HRV-16 (median 2126 viral copies/ng RNA, 95% CI 204-11,080, vs. 92 viral copies/ng RNA, 95% CI 24-289, p=0.002). SARS-CoV-2 replication was also significantly reduced when AECs were treated with recombinant IFN-β1 (median 2126 viral copies/ng RNA, 95% CI 204-11,080, vs. 81 viral copies/ng RNA, 95% CI 3-172, p=0.005) or IFN-λ2 (median 2126 viral copies/ng RNA, 95% CI 204-11,080, vs. 48 viral copies/ng RNA, 95% CI 26-143, p=0.001). Conclusion: SARS-CoV-2 elicits a less robust IFN I/III response by primary bronchial AECs than HRV-16. Pre-infection of AECs with HRV-16, or pre-treatment with recombinant IFN-β1 or IFN-λ2 markedly reduces SARS-CoV-2 replication.","Vanderwall, E. R.; Barrow, K. A.; Rich, L. M.; White, M.

Concerns about the safety of administration of immunosuppressive drugs have been raised for treatment of psoriasis (PSO), and there is insufficient evidence for the risk of COVID-19 infection for psoriatic patients using these drugs, so we did a review, focusing on the risk of overall infection associated with the most commonly used immunosuppressive drugs, such as methotrexate, biologics, cyclosporin, Janus kinase inhibitors for the treatment of PSO. The data on the effect of immunosuppressive drugs on this virus may be ever-changing and remains to be clear. We recommend the initiation and continuation of low-risk immunomodulating drugs, such as Interleukin (IL)-17, IL-12/23, and IL-23 inhibitors, for treatment of PSO during COVID-19 era. For psoriatic patients with comorbidities switching to safer modalities such as systemic retinoids, apremilast, and home phototherapy is recommended.

To explore the potency of the CT-P59 monoclonal antibody against P.1 variant, we tried to conduct binding affinity, in vitro neutralization, and in vivo animal tests. In in vitro assays revealed that CT-P59 is able to neutralize P.1 variant in spite of reduction in its binding affinity against a RBD (receptor binding domain) mutant protein including K417T/E484K/N501Y and neutralizing activity against P.1 pseudoviruses and live viruses. In contrast, in vivo hACE2 (human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2)-expressing TG (transgenic) mouse challenge experiment demonstrated that a clinically relevant or lower dosages of CT-P59 is capable of lowering viral loads in the respiratory tract and alleviates symptoms such as body weight losses and survival rates.

A comprehensive assessment of viral RNA and AKI rate in patients with COVID-19,2021,"Objectives: We aimed to develop a scale and evaluate this scale's validity and reliability to measure factors affecting people's knowledge and attitudes toward the pandemic breaking transmission chain. Methods: This exploratory mixed-method study was carried out in two phases: (1) item generation using literature reviews and interviews and, (2) item reduction by psychometric assessments of the developed scale. The face, content, construct (exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis), convergent, and discriminant validity of the scale were assessed in the Iranian population (n = 500) from March to June 2020. The Composite Reliability (CR) and the internal consistency correlation coefficient were estimated. Results: The Knowledge and Attitude Scale Toward COVID-19 Pandemic Breaking Transmission Chain (KA-C) among the Iranian population included 18 items. Two factors with a whole variance of 66.05% were identified by exploratory factor analysis. Factors were labeled as ""health literacy"" and ""home health empowerment."" The confirmatory factor analysis showed the goodness of fit. The CR of the scale for first and second factors were 0.965 and 0.833 receptively. The scale's internal consistency correlation coefficient was acceptable (Cronbach's alpha = 0.960 and 0.823, average interitem correlation = 0.643 and 0.635, McDonald's omega = 0.963 and 0.829, for the first and second factor, receptively).

Not much literature is available regarding the effect of COVID-19 on LFTs in patients without preexisting liver disease. The study aimed to find the effect of COVID-19 in these patients. Methods: This was a single-center, observational study with 142 patients who were admitted with COVID-19 during three months. Seven patients were excluded due to the presence of chronic liver disease. Results: A total of 135 patients were included in the study aged between 18 and 95 years (mean 57.7 +/- 15.6);among them, 93 were males (68.9%). Hypertension was present in 74 patients (54.8%), and diabetes was present in 48 patients (35.6%). Fever was the chief complaint in 112 patients (83%), followed by dyspnea in 93 patients (68.9%) and cough in 79 patients (58.5%). Elevated aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was seen in 35 patients (26%), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) in 43 patients (32%), alanine transaminase (ALT) in 18 patients (24%), alkaline phosphatase in 19 patients (14%), bilirubin in six patients (4%), and low albumin in 27 patients (20%). Severe COVID-19, when compared with mild to moderate disease, was associated with elevated AST &gt; two-time upper limit normal (2ULN) (p = 0.002), GGT &gt; 2ULN (0.026), and lower albumin (p = 0.020), higher systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) (0.045), raised procalcitonin (p = 0.045), higher ferritin (p = 0.005), lower pO2 (p = 0.044), and higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA) (p = 0.002) pointing to the inflammatory response as cause of liver injury. Factors predicting mortality with COVID-19 were assessed, which showed that direct bilirubin (p = 0.001), low albumin (p = 0.013), tachypnea (0.002), and leukocytosis (&lt;0.001) were independently associated with increased COVID-19-related mortality. Conclusion: Patients suffering from COVID-19 have evidence of liver injury, which appears to be secondary to an inflammatory response that correlates with the severity of COVID-19.","Altaf, A.; Abbas, Z.; Mandviwalla, H.

505962,Quarantine and the risk of COVID-19 importation,2020,"AIM: To identify strategies that increase hospital bed capacity, material resources, and available nurse staffing during a national pandemic. BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 outbreak resulted in an influx of acutely ill patients requiring critical care. The volume and acuity of this patient population increased the demand for care and stretched hospitals beyond their capacity. While increasing hospital bed capacity and material resources are crucial, healthcare systems have noted one of the greatest limitations to rapid expansion has been the number of available medical personnel, particularly those trained in emergency and critical care nursing. EVALUATION: Program evaluation occurred on a daily basis with hospital throughput, focusing on logistics including our ability to expand bed volume, resource utilization, and the ability to meet staffing needs. CONCLUSION: This article describes how a quaternary care hospital in New York City prepared for the COVID-19 surge in patients by maximizing and shifting nursing resources to its most impacted services, the emergency department (ED) and the intensive care units (ICUs). A tier-based staffing model and rapid training were operationalized to address nurse-staffing shortages in the ICU and ED, identifying key factors for swift deployment. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGERS: Frequent communication between staff and leaders improves teamwork and builds trust and buy-in during normal operations and particularly in times of crisis.","Wells, Celia M; Zhang, Ziya; Spano-Szekely, Lauraine; Siller, Jennifer; Brannon, Helen; Schulz, Kathleen; Scott, Christine; Dolphy, Melody; Hughes, Ellen; Kohli-Seth, Roopa",J Nurs Adm,,359

BACKGROUND: In 2015, the MERS epidemic struck Korea, and ill-prepared nurses had to care for patients with MERS. Nurses experienced conflict between their fear of the disease and their work and professional ethic. DESIGN: We employed a phenomenological qualitative approach. METHODS: Inductive, qualitative, in-depth interviews were performed with 17 nurses. The study process followed the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ) checklist. RESULTS: The qualitative inductive content analysis generated seven theme clusters and 18 themes. The theme clusters were ""Fear of Uncertainty,"" ""Beyond Hesitation,"" ""A Scene Like a Battlefield,"" ""Chaotic Nursing Identity,"" ""Buttresses for Sustainability,"" ""Lingering Trauma"" and ""Expanded Horizon of Nursing."" The final analysis revealed that the core theme was ""Beyond the fear of uncertainty."" CONCLUSIONS: This study contrives a more in-depth, holistic understanding by describing the experiences of nurses who directly cared for patients with MERS-the first large-scale infectious disease in Korea. Although nurses saw themselves as vital caregivers, they were frightened of the disease, had to work in a harsh environment, experienced various internal conflicts and had to deal with varying forms of uncertainty. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: This study sheds light on the nursing situation during crises involving serious infectious diseases; to combat these, more medical facilities are needed, and staff should be proactively guided on how to care for patients. It can serve as part of a good foundation for further study of medical staff during recurring epidemics.","Lee, Jin Young; Hong, Jeong Hee; Park, Eun Young",J Clin Nurs,,359

506803,[Subacute Thyroiditis and Covid-19 (Review)],2021,"The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of rapid testing and social distancing in controlling the spread of COVID-19, particularly in the city of Jakarta, Indonesia. We formulate a modified susceptible exposed infectious recovered compartmental model considering asymptomatic individuals. Rapid testing is intended to trace the existence of asymptomatic infected individuals among the population. This asymptomatic class is categorized into two subclasses: detected and undetected asymptomatic individuals. Furthermore, the model considers the limitations of medical resources to treat an infected individual in a hospital. The model shows two types of equilibrium point: COVID-19 free and COVID-19 endemic. The COVID-19-free equilibrium point is locally and asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number (R 0) is less than unity. In contrast, COVID-19-endemic equilibrium always exists when R 0&gt;1. The model can also show a backward bifurcation at R 0=1 whenever the treatment saturation parameter, which describes the hospital capacity, is larger than a specific threshold. To justify the model parameters, we use the incidence data from the city of Jakarta, Indonesia. The data pertain to infected individuals who self-isolate in their homes and visit the hospital for further treatment. Our numerical experiments indicate that strict social distancing has the potential to succeed in reducing and delaying the time of an outbreak. However, if the strict social distancing policy is relaxed, a massive rapid-test intervention should be conducted to avoid a large-scale outbreak in the future.","Aldila, Dipo; Khoshnaw, Sarbaz H.A.; Safitri, Egi; Anwar, Yusril Rais; Bakry, Aanisah R.Q.; Samiadji, Brenda M.; Anugerah, Demas A.; GH, M.

However, PWH now lose more life-years to tobacco use than to HIV infection. Unfortunately, PWH smoke at higher rates and have more difficulty maintaining abstinence than the general population, compounding their risk for chronic disease. In this Commentary, we describe a United States National Cancer Institute (NCI)-led initiative to address the relative lack of research focused on developing, testing, and implementing smoking cessation interventions for PWH. This initiative supports seven clinical trials designed to systematically test and/or develop and test adaptations of evidence-based smoking cessation interventions for PWH (e.g., combination of behavioral and pharmacological). We summarize each project, including setting/recruitment sites, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions being tested, and outcomes. This initiative provides critical opportunities for collaboration and data harmonization across projects. The knowledge gained will inform strategies to assist PWH to promote and maintain abstinence, and ensure that these efforts are adaptable and scalable, thereby addressing one of the major threats to the health of PWH. Reducing smoking behavior may be particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic given that smokers who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be at risk for more severe disease.","Ashare, Rebecca L; Bernstein, Steven L; Schnoll, Robert; Gross, Robert; Catz, Sheryl L; Cioe, Patricia; Crothers, Kristina; Hitsman, Brian; Marhefka, Stephanie L; McClure, Jennifer B; Pacek, Lauren R; Vidrine, Damon J; Vilardaga, Roger; Kaufman, Annette; Edelman, E Jennifer",Nicotine tob. res,,359

This study identifies variability in prices of products acquired through government-driven contracts in Ecuador during the early pandemic response, when the highest mortality rates were registered in a single day. Data were obtained from the National Public Procurement Service (SERCOP) database between March 1 and July 31, 2020. A statistical descriptive analysis was conducted to extract relevant measures for commonly purchased products, medical devices, pharmaceutical drugs, and other goods. Among the most frequently purchased products, the greatest amounts were spent on face masks (US$4.5 million), acetaminophen (US$2.2 million), and reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay kits (US$1.8 million). Prices varied greatly, depending on each individual contract and on the number of units purchased; some were exceptionally higher than their market value. Compared with 2019, the mean price of medical examination gloves increased up to 1,307%, acetaminophen 500 mg pills, up to 796%, and oxygen flasks, 30.8%. In a context of budgetary constraints that actually required an effective use of available funds, speculative price hikes may have limited patient access to health care and the protection of the general population and health care workers. COVID-19 vaccine allocations to privileged individuals have also been widely reported. Price caps and other forms of regulation, as well as greater scrutiny and transparency of government-driven purchases, and investment in local production, are warranted in Ecuador for improved infectious disease prevention.","Ortiz-Prado, Esteban; Fernandez-Naranjo, Raul; Torres-Berru, Yeferson; Lowe, Rachel; Torres, Irene",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,359

The majority of patients showed nonspecific symptoms such as fever, dry cough, and fatigue. Most patients have a good prognosis while some with severe conditions could rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and even die. The exacerbation of the patient's condition may be due to a cytokine storm in the body. Effective targeted therapies including antiviral and immunization are urgently needed. Although many clinical trials are already underway and the majority of patients have received antiviral therapy based on medication experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and preliminary results from some clinical trials, there are no antiviral drugs proven to be effective currently.

In this study, we aimed to estimate the incidence of 2019-nCoV infection among people under home quarantine in Shenzhen, China. METHODS: We used a stratified multistage random sampling method to recruit participants and collected demographic information and laboratory results of people under home quarantine. We conducted descriptive analysis to estimate the basic characteristics and to calculate the incidence in out study population. RESULTS: A total of 2004 people under home quarantine participated in this study, of which 1637 participants finished the questionnaire with a response rate of 81.7%. Mean age of the participants was 33.7 years, ranging from 0.3 to 80.2 years. Of people who provided clear travel history, 129 people have traveled to Wuhan city and 1,046 people have traveled to other cities in Hubei province within 14 days before the home quarantine. Few (less than 1%) participants reported contact history with confirmed or suspected cases during their trip and most of these arrived at Shenzhen between Jan 24, 2020 to Jan 27, 2020. The incidence of COVID-19 in the sample was 1.5 (95% CI: 0.31-4.37). CONCLUSION: Home quarantine has been effective in preventing the early transmission of COVID-19, but that more needs to be done to improve early detection of COVID-19 infection.","Wang, Jingzhong; Liao, Yi; Wang, Xiaoyang; Li, Yichong; Jiang, Dan; He, Jianfan; Zhang, Shunxiang; Xia, Junjie",Travel Med Infect Dis,,359

PURPOSE: To assess the controversial indications for and limitations of ending the instrumentation for posterior spinal fusion (PSF) at L5 in patients with flaccid neuromuscular scoliosis (fNMS). METHODS: We reviewed the cases of 45 patients with progressive spinal deformity as a result of fNMS treated by PSF to L5 and followed for an average of 4 years postoperatively with adequate clinical and radiological data. Anterior-posterior and lateral whole spine radiographs were evaluated. We divided patients into two groups based on the degree of pelvic obliquity (PO) at the final follow-up. Radiographic data from the two groups were analyzed to identify the indications and limitations of this surgical method focusing on PO. RESULTS: Preoperatively, there were significant differences between the two groups in Cobb angle, PO, thoracolumbar kyphosis, and lumbar lordosis (LL) while sitting; Cobb angle and LL while supine (Supine Cobb, and Supine LL); and major curve flexibility. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified Supine Cobb and Supine LL as independent risk factors for residual PO at the final follow-up (Supine Cobb: odds ratio, 1.1; 95% confidence interval 1.0-1.2, Supine LL: odds ratio, 0.9; 95% confidence interval 0.8-1.0). CONCLUSION: Patients with larger preoperative Cobb angle and smaller LL while supine may not achieve adequate spine and pelvic correction and this may lead to deterioration in the PO over time, even after spinal fusion ending at L5.","Saito, Wataru; Inoue, Gen; Shirasawa, Eiki; Imura, Takayuki; Nakazawa, Toshiyuki; Miyagi, Masayuki; Kawakubo, Ayumu; Uchida, Kentaro; Kotani, Toshiaki; Akazawa, Tsutomu; Takaso, Masashi",Spine Deform,,359

There was an urgent need to look for the remedy and control this deadly disease. A new strain of coronavirus called Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was considered to be responsible for COVID-19. Novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) belongs to the family of coronaviruses crowned with homotrimeric class 1 fusion spike protein (or S protein) on their surfaces. COVID-19 attacks primarily at our throat and lungs epithelial cells. In COVID-19, a stronger adaptive immune response against SARS-CoV-2 can lead to longer recovery time and leads to several complications. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for examining the consequence of adaptive immune responses to the viral mutation to control disease transmission. We consider three populations, namely, the uninfected epithelial cells, infected cells, and the SARS-CoV-2 virus. We also take into account combination drug therapy on the dynamics of COVID-19 and its effect. We present a fractional-order model representing COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells. The main aim of our study is to explore the effect of adaptive immune response using fractional order operator to monitor the influence of memory on the cell-biological aspects. Also, we have studied the outcome of an antiviral drug on the system to obstruct the contact between epithelial cells and SARS-CoV-2 to restrict the COVID-19 disease. Numerical simulations have been done to illustrate our analytical findings.","Chatterjee, Amar Nath; Ahmad, Bashir",Chaos Solitons Fractals,,359

513607,"Prisons are ""in no way equipped"" to deal with COVID-19",2020,"Introduction: Globally, the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses a high risk for Healthcare Workers (HCWs) who are among the population that is most vulnerable of being infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). With a prevailing pandemic such as COVID-19, it becomes important to understand the presence and persistence of antibodies in the serum of HCW, testing positive for COVID-19 on Reverse transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). An understanding of the prevalence of IgG antibodies against COVID-19 and the duration for which they are present in the serum will help in predicting the immune response of individuals against the disease. Aim: To study the prevalence of COVID-19 IgG antibodies in laboratory confirmed COVID-19 RT-PCR positive symptomatic, asymptomatic and RT-PCR negative subjects. Materials and Methods: The present longitudinal study was conducted from April 2020 to December 2020 with a sample size of 90 participants based on a pilot study. Blood sample was collected and serum was separated. Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) was done to detect the presence of COVID-19 IgG antibody in serum. Chi-square test and Pearson correlation were used to find out the statistical significance of COVID-19 IgG antibodies in COVID-19 positive and negative HCWs and the relationship between Cycle threshold values (Ct) and antibody levels, respectively. Results: Fever with sore throat was the most common (33%) symptom. Chi-square test done to compare IgG among RT-PCR positive and negative subjects showed p-value of &lt;0.00001 which was significant. However, statistical significance was not found (p-value 0.9973) with respect to COVID-19 IgG antibodies in RT-PCR positive COVID-19 asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects. Mean antibody index in symptomatic and asymptomatic was 3.7743±1.9834 and 3.571±1.7961, respectively. Average number of days, the antibodies persisted was 25 days-266 days. Conclusion: The prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies among RT-PCR positive symptomatic, asymptomatic and RT-PCR negative subjects was 88%, 67% and 27%, respectively. The maximum number of days antibodies persisted was 266 days. Further studies will elucidate whether these antibodies prevent re-infection.","Dhason, T.

513608,"Prisons are ""in no way equipped"" to deal with COVID-19",2020,"Meta-control is necessary to regulate the balance between cognitive stability and flexibility. Evidence from (voluntary) task switching studies suggests performance-contingent reward as one modulating factor. Depending on the immediate reward history, reward prospect seems to promote either cognitive stability or flexibility: Increasing reward prospect reduced switch costs and increased the voluntary switch rate, suggesting increased cognitive flexibility. In contrast, remaining high reward prospect increased switch costs and reduced the voluntary switch rate, suggesting increased cognitive stability. Recently we suggested that increasing reward prospect serves as a meta-control signal toward cognitive flexibility by lowering the updating threshold in working memory. However, in task switching paradigms with two tasks only, this could alternatively be explained by facilitated switching to the other of two tasks. To address this issue, a series of task switching experiments with uncued task switching between three univalent tasks was conducted. Results showed a reduction in reaction time (RT) switch costs to a nonsignificant difference and a high voluntary switch rate when reward prospect increased, whereas repetition RTs were faster, switch RTs slower, and voluntary switch rate was reduced when reward prospect remained high. That is, increasing reward prospect put participants in a state of equal readiness to respond to any target stimulus-be it a task repetition or a switch to one of the other two tasks. The study thus provides further evidence for the assumption that increasing reward prospect serves as a meta-control signal to increase cognitive flexibility, presumably by lowering the updating threshold in working memory.","Fröber, Kerstin; Dreisbach, Gesine",,,359
513618,Urgent needs to accelerate the race for COVID-19 therapeutics,2021,"The world remains cautiously optimistic about a COVID-19 vaccine that is relatively safe and efficacious and that offers sufficient long-lasting protection/immunity by neutralizing the virus infectivity. However, key technical hurdles pertaining to antigen-adjuvant formulation, delivery, and manufacturing challenges of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for mRNA vaccines and stability of formulations need to be addressed for successful product development and stockpiling. In addition, the dosage form, the dosage level and regimen for eliciting a protective immune response remain to be established. The high dependence of global supply chains and demand-supply to sourcing quality raw materials, glassware and other supplies, along with the stress on existing production capacities and platform-specific manufacturing challenges could impede vaccine development and access. This article provides critical analysis of vaccine development processes and unit operations that can derail the pandemic response, and also extends to other emerging infectious disease development efforts - issues that take on added significance given the global mandate for an accelerated and at-risk development path to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rele, Shyam",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,359

514670,Abstract #1001394: A Rare Endocrine Complication of the COVID-19 Vaccine,2021,"Emerging viral infections are among the greatest challenges in the public health sector in the twenty-first century. Among these, most of the viruses jump from other species of animals to humans called zoonotic viruses. The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), by crossing species-barrier, has infected the human population for the third time in the current century and has caused the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) . Mutation and adaptation for years have greatly influenced the co-evolution and existence of coronaviruses and their possible hosts including humans. The appearance of SARS-CoV-2 in China thrust coronaviruses into the limelight and shocked the world. Presently, no coronavirus vaccines are clinically available to combat the virus's devastating effects. To counter the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is therefore important to understand the complex nature of coronaviruses and their clinical attributes. SARS and MERS outbreaks had ultimately led to socio-economic deprivation in the previous decades. In addressing the recent disastrous situation, the COVID-19 pandemic still needs some lessons from prior experience. In this review, we have highlighted the chronological order of coronavirus strains, their genomic features, the mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2, and its disastrous repercussions on the world. We have also suggested some therapeutic options that could be effective against the COVID-19.","Sajjad, Humna; Majeed, Mohsin; Imtiaz, Saiqa; Siddiqah, Mariyam; Sajjad, Anila; Din, Misbahud; Ali, Muhammad",Biologia (Bratisl),,359

The virus is 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), never been seen previously in human, but all the population is generally susceptible. The virus spreads through many ways and is highly infectious, which brings great difficulties to the prevention and control of NCP. Based on the needs of orthopedic trauma patients for emergency surgery and review of the latest NCP diagnosis and treatment strategy and the latest principles and principles of evidence-based medicine in traumatic orthopedics, the authors put forward this expert consensus to systematically standardize the clinical pathway and protective measures of emergency surgery for orthopedic trauma patients during prevention and control of NCP and provide reference for the emergency surgical treatment of orthopedic trauma patients in hospitals at all levels.","LIU, Jing; Hui, LI; ZHOU, Wu; LIU, Guohui; ZHANG, Yingze; JIANG, Baoguo; TANG, Peifu; LIU, Guodong; Xinbao, WU; YUAN, Zhi; ZHOU, Fang; WANG, Tianbing; Zhongguo, FU; HOU, Zhiyong; Jiacan, SU; Bin, YU; SHAO, Zengwu; XIA, Tian; XIONG, Liming; FANG, Yue; WANG, Guanglin; LIN, Peng; CHEN, Yanxi; Jiangdong, NI; YANG, Lei; WANG, Dongliang; Chengjian, HE; LIU, Ximing; CHE, Biao; Yaming, LI; WANG, Junwen; CHEN, Ming; ZHAO, Meng; CAO, Faqi; SUN, Yun; Bobin, MI; LIU, Mengfei; XIONG, Yuan; XUE, Hang; Liangcong, HU; Yiqiang, HU; CHEN, Lang; YAN, Chenchen",Chinese Journal of Trauma,,359
515027,Smell/Taste alteration in COVID-19 may reflect zinc deficiency,2021,"Invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are difficult to diagnose and to treat and, despite several available antifungal drugs, cause high mortality rates. In the past decades, the incidence of IFIs has continuously increased. More recently, SARS-CoV-2-associated lethal IFIs have been reported worldwide in critically ill patients. Combating IFIs requires a more profound understanding of fungal pathogenicity to facilitate the development of novel antifungal strategies. Animal models are indispensable for studying fungal infections and to develop new antifungals. However, using mammalian animal models faces various hurdles including ethical issues and high costs, which makes large-scale infection experiments extremely challenging. To overcome these limitations, we optimized an invertebrate model and introduced a simple calcofluor white (CW) staining protocol to macroscopically and microscopically monitor disease progression in silkworms (Bombyx mori) infected with the human pathogenic filamentous fungi Aspergillus fumigatus and Lichtheimia corymbifera. This advanced silkworm A. fumigatus infection model could validate knockout mutants with either attenuated, strongly attenuated or unchanged virulence. Finally, CW staining allowed us to efficiently visualize antifungal treatment outcomes in infected silkworms. Conclusively, we here present a powerful animal model combined with a straightforward staining protocol to expedite large-scale in vivo research of fungal pathogenicity and to investigate novel antifungal candidates.","Yu, Yidong; Wolf, Ann-Katrin; Thusek, Sina; Heinekamp, Thorsten; Bromley, Michael; Krappmann, Sven; Terpitz, Ulrich; Voigt, Kerstin; Brakhage, Axel A; Beilhack, Andreas",,,359

The Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH) is the state's designated quarantine hospital. AIM: To determine the characteristics, outcomes and predictors of outcomes for hospitalised patients with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) within the RAH. METHODS: We performed a retrospective audit of 103 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 who were discharged from the RAH between 14 February and 21 May 2020. We collected demographic, clinical and laboratory data through an audit of electronic medical records. The main outcome measures were: (i) the need for oxygen supplementation; (ii) need for intensive care unit (ICU) care; and (iii) death in hospital. RESULTS: The median age of patients was 60 years (range 19-85). A total of 55 (53%) patients was male. All patients were independent at baseline; 37 (36%) patients suffered from hypertension. Cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease and diabetes were present in fewer than 19 (18%) patients. Obesity was present in 24 (23%) patients; 39 (38%) patients required supplemental oxygen, 18 (17%) required ICU care and 4 (4%) patients died. Older patients were significantly more at risk of oxygen requirement (median 68 vs 57.5 years, P < 0.01), ICU admission (median 66.5 vs 60 years, P = 0.04) and death (median 74.5 vs 60 years, P = 0.02). We did not find a statistically significant association between gender, body mass index and poor outcomes. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was the only parameter at admission associated with oxygen requirement, ICU care and death. Peak LDH, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, C-reactive protein and neutrophil lymphocyte ratio were significantly associated with oxygen requirement, ICU admission and death (P < 0.05 for all of the above laboratory markers). CONCLUSIONS: Although our sample size was small, we found that certain comorbidities and laboratory values were associated with poor outcomes. This occurred in a setting where care was not influenced by limited hospital and intensive care beds.","Toh, Dylan J-W; Rowe, Emily; Nelson, Renjy; O039,; Connell, Alice; Lim, Ken; Fielke, Lauren; He, Jiacheng; Faunt, Jeffrey",Intern Med J,,359

There are a few published cases of COVID-19 occurring during pregnancy and due the possibility of mother-fetal vertical transmission, there is a concern that the fetuses may be at risk of congenital COVID-19. Methods: We reviewed the risk of vertical transmission of COVID-19 to the fetus of infected mothers by using data of published articles or official websites up to March 4, 2020. Results: A total of 31 infected pregnant mothers with COVID-19 were reported. No COVID-19 infection was detected in their neonates or placentas. Two mothers died from COVID-19-related respiratory complications after delivery. Conclusions: Currently, based on limited data, there is no evidence for intrauterine transmission of COVID-19 from infected pregnant women to their fetuses. Mothers may be at increased risk for more severe respiratory complications.","Karimi-Zarchi, Mojgan; Neamatzadeh, Hossein; Dastgheib, Seyed Alireza; Abbasi, Hajar; Mirjalili, Seyed Reza; Behforouz, Athena; Ferdosian, Farzad; Bahrami, Reza",Fetal Pediatr Pathol,,359
515379,COVID-19 vaccination passports,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Stage 1: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of candidate agents as add-on therapies to standard of care (SoC) in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in a screening stage. Stage 2: To confirm the efficacy of candidate agents selected on the basis of evidence from Stage 1 in patients hospitalised with COVID-19 in an expansion stage. TRIAL DESIGN: ACCORD is a seamless, Phase 2, adaptive, randomised controlled platform study, designed to rapidly test candidate agents in the treatment of COVID-19. Designed as a master protocol with each candidate agent being included via its own sub-protocol, initially randomising equally between each candidate and a single contemporaneous SoC arm (which can adapt into 2:1). Candidate agents currently include bemcentinib, MEDI3506, acalabrutinib, zilucoplan and nebulised heparin. For each candidate a total of 60 patients will be recruited in Stage 1. If Stage 1 provides evidence of efficacy and acceptable safety the candidate will enter Stage 2 where a total of approximately 126 patients will be recruited into each study arm sub-protocol. Enrollees and outcomes will not be shared across the Stages; the endpoint, analysis and sample size for Stage 2 may be adjusted based on evidence from Stage 1. Additional arms may be added as new potential candidate agents are identified via candidate agent specific sub-protocols. PARTICIPANTS: The study will include hospitalised adult patients (&#8805;18 years) with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, the virus that causes COVID-19, that clinically meet Grades 3 (hospitalised - mild disease, no oxygen therapy), Grades 4 (hospitalised, oxygen by mask or nasal prongs) and 5 (hospitalised, non-invasive ventilation or high flow oxygen) of the WHO Working Group on the Clinical Characteristics of COVID-19 9-point category ordinal scale. Participants will be recruited from England, Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Comparator is current standard of care (SoC) for the treatment of COVID-19. Current candidate experimental arms include bemcentinib, MEDI3506, acalabrutinib, zilucoplan and nebulised heparin with others to be added over time. Bemcentinib could potentially reduce viral infection and blocks SARS-CoV-2 spike protein; MEDI3506 is a clinic-ready anti-IL-33 monoclonal antibody with the potential to treat respiratory failure caused by COVID; acalabrutinib is a BTK inhibitor which is anti-viral and anti-inflammatory; zilucoplan is a complement C5 inhibitor which may block the severe inflammatory response in COVID-19 and; nebulised heparin has been shown to bind with the spike protein. ACCORD is linked with the UK national COVID therapeutics task force to help prioritise candidate agents. MAIN OUTCOMES: Time to sustained clinical improvement of at least 2 points (from randomisation) on the WHO 9-point category ordinal scale, live discharge from the hospital, or considered fit for discharge (a score of 0, 1, or 2 on the ordinal scale), whichever comes first, by Day 29 (this will also define the ""responder"" for the response rate analyses). RANDOMISATION: An electronic randomization will be performed by Cenduit using Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Randomisation will be stratified by baseline severity grade. Randomisation will proceed with an equal allocation to each arm and a contemporaneous SoC arm (e.g. 1:1 if control and 1 experimental arm; 1:1:1 if two experimental candidate arms etc) but will be reviewed as the trial progresses and may be changed to 2:1 in favour of the candidate agents. BLINDING (MASKING): The trial is open label and no blinding is currently planned in the study. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): This will be in the order of 60 patients per candidate agent for Stage 1, and 126 patients for Stage 2. However, sample size re-estimation may be considered after Stage 1. It is estimated that up to 1800 patients will participate in the overall study. TRIAL STATUS: Master protocol version ACCORD-2-001 - Master Protocol (Amendment 1) 22nd April 2020, the trial has full regulatory approval and recruitment is ongoing in the bemcentinib (first patient recruited 6/5/2020), MEDI3506 (first patient recruited 19/5/2020), acalabrutinib (first patient recruited 20/5/2020) and zilucoplan (first patient recruited 19/5/2020) candidates (and SoC). The recruitment dates of each arm will vary between candidate agents as they are added or dropped from the trial, but will have recruited and reported within a year.

516382,Understanding the Global Panic Underlying the Pandemic: a Phylogenetic Perspective,2020,"BACKGROUND: The differences in the characteristics and main causes of critical COVID-19 infection in non-elderly and elderly severe patients remain unknown. METHODS: We included 273 adult patients with confirmed severe COVID-19 from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan, China from February 10 to March 8, 2020. Clinical characteristics and risk factors for outcomes were compared between the young and middle-aged and the elderly severe patients. RESULTS: Hemoglobin, neutrophil percentage, inflammatory markers, hepatic, renal, and cardiovascularparameters differed between the non-elderly and elderly severe patients. In young and middle-aged patients, critical patients showed higher high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) during hospitalization than severe patients. However, in the elderly patients, critical patients showed decreased hsCRP during hospitalization and higher proBNP values. The hsCRP fluctuation and proBNP were independent risk factors for intensive care unit (ICU) admission in young and middle-aged severe patients (OR=1.068) and elderly severe patients (OR=1.026), respectively. CONCLUSION: The study revealed different potential causes of disease and predictive factors for non-elderly and elderly critical patients and treatment recommendations. Deterioration of inflammatory state was the main cause of ICU admission in young and middle-aged severe COVID-19 patients, while a decline in hsCRP was not associated with better outcomes in elderly severe patients, indicating the need for different treatments for non-elderly and elderly severe patients. Anti-inflammatory therapy with corticosteroids should be considered in the early disease stage among non-elderly severe patients, but cardiovascular protection plays a more important role in elderly severe patients.","Liu, Zhelong; Wu, Danning; Han, Xia; Jiang, Wangyan; Qiu, Lin; Tang, Rui; Yu, Xuefeng",Int Immunopharmacol,,359

Zakaz „wypożyczania ciał”, czyli o immersyjności pandemicznej i tęsknotach za „prawdziwymi symulakrami”",2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has brought science into the public eye and to the attention of governments more than ever before Much of this attention is on work in epidemiology, virology and public health, with most behavioural advice in public health focusing squarely on 'proximate' determinants of behaviour While epidemiological models are powerful tools to predict the spread of disease when human behaviour is stable, most do not incorporate behavioural change The evolutionary basis of our preferences and the cultural evolutionary dynamics of our beliefs drive behavioural change, so understanding these evolutionary processes can help inform individual and government decision-making in the face of a pandemic Lay summary: The COVID-19 pandemic has brought behavioural sciences into the public eye: Without vaccinations, stopping the spread of the virus must rely on behaviour change by limiting contact between people On the face of it, “stop seeing people” sounds simple In practice, this is hard Here we outline how an evolutionary perspective on behaviour change can provide additional insights Evolutionary theory postulates that our psychology and behaviour did not evolve to maximize our health or that of others Instead, individuals are expected to act to maximise their inclusive fitness (i e, spreading our genes) - which can lead to a conflict between behaviours that are in the best interests for the individual, and behaviours that stop the spread of the virus By examining the ultimate explanations of behaviour related to pandemic-management (such as behavioural compliance and social distancing), we conclude that “good of the group” arguments and “one size fits all” policies are unlikely to encourage behaviour change over the long-term Sustained behaviour change to keep pandemics at bay is much more likely to emerge from environmental change, so governments and policy makers may need to facilitate significant social change - such as improving life experiences for disadvantaged groups © The Author(s) 2020 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Foundation for Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (http://creativecommons org/licenses/by/4 0/), which permits unrestricted reuse, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited","Arnot, M.; Brandl, E.; Campbell, O.

518767,COVID-19 Induced Mesenteric Venous Infarction,2021,"Countries around the world are in a state of lockdown to help limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, as the number of new daily confirmed cases begins to decrease, governments must decide how to release their populations from quarantine as efficiently as possible without overwhelming their health services. We applied an optimal control framework to an adapted Susceptible-Exposure-Infection-Recovery (SEIR) model framework to investigate the efficacy of two potential lockdown release strategies, focusing on the UK population as a test case. To limit recurrent spread, we find that ending quarantine for the entire population simultaneously is a high-risk strategy, and that a gradual re-integration approach would be more reliable. Furthermore, to increase the number of people that can be first released, lockdown should not be ended until the number of new daily confirmed cases reaches a sufficiently low threshold. We model a gradual release strategy by allowing different fractions of those in lockdown to re-enter the working non-quarantined population. Mathematical optimization methods, combined with our adapted SEIR model, determine how to maximize those working while preventing the health service from being overwhelmed. The optimal strategy is broadly found to be to release approximately half the population 2–4 weeks from the end of an initial infection peak, then wait another 3–4 months to allow for a second peak before releasing everyone else. We also modeled an “on-off” strategy, of releasing everyone, but re-establishing lockdown if infections become too high. We conclude that the worst-case scenario of a gradual release is more manageable than the worst-case scenario of an on-off strategy, and caution against lockdown-release strategies based on a threshold-dependent on-off mechanism. The two quantities most critical in determining the optimal solution are transmission rate and the recovery rate, where the latter is defined as the fraction of infected people in any given day that then become classed as recovered. We suggest that the accurate identification of these values is of particular importance to the ongoing monitoring of the pandemic.","Rawson, Thomas; Brewer, Tom; Veltcheva, Dessislava; Huntingford, Chris; Bonsall, Michael B.",Front.

The neglect in managing NCDs during emergencies may result in fatal consequences for individuals living with comorbidities. This paper aims to highlight the need for a paradigm shift in the governance of public health emergencies to simultaneously address NCD and noncommunicable disease (CD) pandemics while taking into account the needs of high-risk populations, underlying etiological factors, and the social, economic, and environmental determinants that are relevant for both CDs and NCDs. Design/methodology/approach: The paper reviews the available global frameworks for pandemic preparedness to highlight the governance challenges of addressing the dual agenda of NCDs and CDs during a public health emergency. It proposes key strategies to strengthen multilevel governance in support of countries to better prepare for public health emergencies through the engagement of a wide range of stakeholders across sectors. Findings: Addressing both CD and NCD pandemics during public health emergencies requires (1) a new framework that unites the narratives and overcomes service and system fragmentations;(2) a multisectoral and multistakeholder governance mechanism empowered and resourced to include stakeholders across sectors and (3) a prioritized research agenda to understand the political economy of pandemics, the role played by different political systems and actors and implementation challenges, and to identify combined strategies to address the converging agendas of CDs and NCDs. Research limitations/implications: The article is based on the review of available published evidence. Practical implications: The uptake of the strategies proposed will better prepare countries to respond to NCD and CD pandemics during public health emergencies. Originality/value: The article is the first of its kind addressing the governance challenges of the dual pandemic of NCDs and CDs in emergencies.","Collins, T.; Tello, J.; Van Hilten, M.; Mahy, L.; Banatvala, N.; Fones, G.; Akselrod, S.; Bull, F.; Cieza, A.; Farrington, J.; Fisher, J.; Gonzalez, C.; Guerra, J.; Hanna, F.; Jakab, Z.; Kulikov, A.; Saeed, K.; Abdel Latif, N.; Mikkelsen, B.; Pourghazian, N.; Troisi, G.; Willumsen, J.",International Journal of Health Governance,,359

Objective: To examine outcomes and risk factors associated with COVID-19 clinical severity in a large, diverse cohort of North American patients with MS. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analysis used deidentified, cross-sectional data on patients with MS and SARS-CoV-2 infection reported by health care professionals in North American academic and community practices between April 1, 2020, and December 12, 2020, in the COVID-19 Infections in MS Registry. Health care professionals were asked to report patients after a minimum of 7 days from initial symptom onset and after sufficient time had passed to observe the COVID-19 disease course through resolution of acute illness or death. Data collection began April 1, 2020, and is ongoing. Exposures: Laboratory-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection or highly suspected COVID-19. Main Outcomes and Measures: Clinical outcome with 4 levels of increasing severity: not hospitalized, hospitalization only, admission to the intensive care unit and/or required ventilator support, and death. Results: Of 1626 patients, most had laboratory-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection (1345 [82.7%]), were female (1202 [74.0%]), and had relapsing-remitting MS (1255 [80.4%]). A total of 996 patients (61.5%) were non-Hispanic White, 337 (20.8%) were Black, and 190 (11.7%) were Hispanic/Latinx. The mean (SD) age was 47.7 (13.2) years, and 797 (49.5%) had 1 or more comorbidity. The overall mortality rate was 3.3% (95% CI, 2.5%-4.3%). Ambulatory disability and older age were each independently associated with increased odds of all clinical severity levels compared with those not hospitalized after adjusting for other risk factors (nonambulatory: hospitalization only, odds ratio [OR], 2.8 [95% CI, 1.6-4.8]; intensive care unit/required ventilator support, OR, 3.5 [95% CI, 1.6-7.8]; death, OR, 25.4 [95% CI, 9.3-69.1]; age [every 10 years]: hospitalization only, OR, 1.3 [95% CI, 1.1-1.6]; intensive care unit/required ventilator support, OR, 1.3 [95% CI, 0.99-1.7]; death, OR, 1.8 [95% CI, 1.2-2.6]). Conclusions and Relevance: In this registry-based cross-sectional study, increased disability was independently associated with worse clinical severity including death from COVID-19. Other risk factors for worse outcomes included older age, Black race, cardiovascular comorbidities, and recent treatment with corticosteroids. Knowledge of these risk factors may improve the treatment of patients with MS and COVID-19 by helping clinicians identify patients requiring more intense monitoring or COVID-19 treatment.","Salter, Amber; Fox, Robert J; Newsome, Scott D; Halper, June; Li, David K B; Kanellis, Pamela; Costello, Kathleen; Bebo, Bruce; Rammohan, Kottil; Cutter, Gary R; Cross, Anne H",JAMA Neurol,,359

As no standard treatment has been found for it yet, several minerals and vitamins with antioxidants, immunomodulators, and antimicrobials roles can be sufficient for the immune response against the disease. The present study evaluates the serum vitamin D, calcium, and Zinc levels in patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS & METHODS: This research is a case-control study performed in May 2020 on 93 patients with COVID-19 hospitalized in a Shoushtar city hospital and on 186 healthy subjects with no symptoms of COVID-19. The serum vitamin D, calcium, and zinc levels were collected and analyzed using correlation coefficient and independent t-test via SPSS 18. RESULTS: Vitamin D levels had a significant difference between the case and control groups (p = 0.008). Serum calcium and serum zinc levels also had statistically significant differences between the two groups (p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: The research results showed that serum zinc, calcium, and vitamin D levels in COVID-19 patients are lower than in the control group. The supplementation with such nutrients is a safe and low-cost measure that can help cope with the increased demand for these nutrients in risk of acquiring the COVID-19 virus.","Elham, Abdolahi Shahvali; Azam, Khalighi; Azam, Jahangirimehr; Mostafa, Labibzadeh; Nasrin, Bahmanyari; Marzieh, Najafi",Clin Nutr ESPEN,,359

Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, might improve outcomes by mitigating inflammation. We conducted a retrospective study of patients admitted to the University of Washington Hospital system with COVID-19 and requiring supplemental oxygen. Outcomes included clinical improvement, defined as a two-point reduction in severity on a six-point ordinal scale or discharge, and mortality within 28 days. We used Cox proportional-hazards models with propensity score inverse probability weighting to compare outcomes in patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. We evaluated 43 patients who received tocilizumab and 45 who did not. Patients receiving tocilizumab were younger with fewer comorbidities but higher baseline oxygen requirements. Tocilizumab treatment was associated with reduced C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and temperature, but there were no meaningful differences in time to clinical improvement (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-2.22) or mortality (aHR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.21-1.52). A numerically higher proportion of tocilizumab-treated patients had subsequent infections, transaminitis, and cytopenias. Tocilizumab did not improve outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. However, this study was not powered to detect small differences, and there remains the possibility for a survival benefit.","Hill, Joshua A; Menon, Manoj P; Dhanireddy, Shireesha; Wurfel, Mark M; Green, Margaret; Jain, Rupali; Chan, Jeannie D; Huang, Joanne; Bethune, Danika; Turtle, Cameron; Johnston, Christine; Xie, Hu; Leisenring, Wendy M; Nina Kim, H; Cheng, Guang-Shing",J Med Virol,,359

522440,COVID-19 screening in a Portuguese pediatric population,2020,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hospitalizations for COVID-19 dramatically increase with age. This is likely because of increases in fragility across biological repair systems and a weakened immune system, including loss of the cardiorenal protective arm of the renin--angiotensin system (RAS), composed of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2)/angiotensin-(1--7) [Ang-(1--7)] and its actions through the Mas receptor. The purpose of this review is to explore how cardiac ACE2 changes with age, cardiac diseases, comorbid conditions and pharmaceutical regimens in order to shed light on a potential hormonal unbalance facilitating SARs-CoV-2 vulnerabilities in older adults. RECENT FINDINGS: Increased ACE2 gene expression has been reported in human hearts with myocardial infarction, cardiac remodeling and heart failure. We also found ACE2 mRNA in atrial appendage tissue from cardiac surgical patients to be positively associated with age, elevated by certain comorbid conditions (e.g. COPD and previous stroke) and increased in conjunction with patients' chronic use of antithrombotic agents and thiazide diuretics but not drugs that block the renin--angiotensin system. SUMMARY: Cardiac ACE2 may have bifunctional roles in COVID-19 as ACE2 not only mediates cellular susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection but also protects the heart via the ACE2/Ang-(1--7) pathway. Linking tissue ACE2 from cardiac surgery patients to their comorbid conditions and medical regimens provides a unique latform to address the influence that altered expression of the ACE2/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis might have on SARs-CoV-2 vulnerability in older adults.","Wang, Hao; Saha, Amit K; Sun, Xuming; Kon, Neal D; Ferrario, Carlos M; Groban, Leanne",Curr Opin Anaesthesiol,,359

524285,Correction to: Gap between patient expectation and perception during pharmacist-patient communication at community pharmacy,2020,"Multilevel regression and poststratification (MRP) has become a popular approach for selection bias adjustment in subgroup estimation, with widespread applications from social sciences to public health. We examine the statistical properties of MRP in connection with poststratification and hierarchical models. The success of MRP prominently depends on the availability of auxiliary information strongly related to the outcome. To improve the outcome model fitting performances, we recommend modeling inclusion mechanisms conditional on auxiliary variables and adding a flexible function of estimated inclusion probabilities in the mean structure. We present a framework for statistical data integration and robust inferences of probability and nonprobability surveys, providing solutions to various challenges in practical applications. Our simulation studies indicate the statistical validity of MRP with a tradeoff between bias and variance, and the improvement over alternative methods is mainly on subgroup estimates with small sample sizes. Our development is motivated by the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study that has collected children across 21 U.S. geographic locations for national representation but is subject to selection bias as a nonprobability sample. We apply the methods for population inferences to evaluate cognition performances of diverse groups of children in the ABCD study and demonstrate that the use of auxiliary variables affects the inferential findings.","Si, Yajuan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.00360v2.pdf,359

Mentees were offered an opportunity to design a twitter based educational resource, tweetorial, with mentor supervision. Program success was assessed by participation and with MEMeQ, a validated mentorship assessment survey. RESULTS 111 students and 93 urology residents enlisted in #Urostream101. All AUA sections were represented. At time of enrollment, 19% (n=21) of medical students lacked affiliation with urology department, 24% (n=27) lacked urology mentors, and 32% (n=36) had no formal clinical exposure to urology. Many students joined twitter during the application cycle (45% within 1 month of enrollment, n=50) for solely professional reasons (71% of participants, n=79). When asked their top priority in participating in #UroStream101, most students answered resident mentorship (61%, n=68) followed by exposure to a geographically distant urology program (32%, n=36).Twenty tweetorials were created spanning the breadth of urology. 29 (26%) students completed the full MEMeQ evaluation survey, assessing a student's goals and satisfaction with mentor. Overall program satisfaction was 6.1/7 on Likert scale, ""very satisfied"". Students identified program selection and ERAS application assistance as their main goals.

[...]IHR (1969) had been drafted so that the WHO was dependent on each state itself reporting the outbreak of a disease – and frequently the states simply abstained from doing this. The review gained considerable momentum when the deadly SARS epidemic broke out in 2003,13 and in 2005, the WHA adopted the presently applicable IHR (2005).14 IHR (2005) figures amongst the international agreements that most states have signed up to.15 Its purpose is “to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade”.16 For our purposes, it is of particular importance that the WHO’s members have undertaken to notify the WHO of events that may constitute what is called a “public health emergency of international concern”.17 When compared with IHR (1969), the adoption of IHR (2005) represents a crucial expansion in the rules’ coverage from three predefined transmittable diseases to any event that could be considered a “public health emergency of international concern” – and, as a matter of principle, this includes any outbreak of a transmittable disease. On 30 January 2020, the WHO’s Director General declared the COVID-19 outbreak a “public health emergency of international concern” (ie an extraordinary event determined to constitute a public health risk to other states through the international spread of disease and to which a coordinated international response could potentially be required).21 This allowed the WHO to issue so-called “temporary recommendations” such as specific health measures to be implemented by the state or states where the disease has broken out.","BROBERG, Morten",European Journal of Risk Regulation : EJRR,https://doi.org/10.1017/err.2020.26,359
590048,A Paradigm for Post-Covid-19 Fatigue Syndrome Analogous to ME/CFS,2021-08-02,"BACKGROUND: Serratia marcescens is an important nosocomial pathogen and the characteristic property of resistance conferred by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase or a novel AmpC cephalosporinase was not unusual in Taiwan. This study investigated the trends in antimicrobial resistance in S. marcescens from a nationwide surveillance in Taiwan. MATERIALS AND METHODS: S. marcescens isolates were collected biennially between 2002 and 2010 from medical centers and regional hospitals throughout Taiwan, as part of the Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance program. Minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute reference broth microdilution method. RESULTS: A total of 403 nonduplicate S. marcescens isolates were collected, mostly from respiratory samples (157, 39.0%), followed by the urinary tract samples (90, 22.3%). Overall, 99.3% isolates were susceptible to imipenem, 93.8% to ceftazidime, 89.2% to minocycline, 87.8% to amikacin, 86.8% to cefepime, 82.9% to aztreonam, 73.2% to ceftriaxone, 72.7% to levofloxacin, 63.8% to ciprofloxacin, 60.8% to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), and 59.6% to gentamicin. A significantly increased susceptibility rate after 2004 was observed for the following antibiotics: amikacin (73.8% vs. 97.1%), gentamicin (40.0% vs. 72.4%), ciprofloxacin (53.8% vs. 70.4%), ceftriaxone (53.8% vs. 86.0%), cefepime (74.4% vs. 95.1%), aztreonam (72.5% vs. 89.7%), and TMP/SMX (41.3% vs. 73.7%). CONCLUSION: In this 8-year study, the susceptibility of S. marcescens to ceftazidime and imipenem remained consistently high in Taiwan. S. marcescens isolates demonstrated relatively higher resistance to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin, and therefore continued surveillance of antimicrobial resistance, especially for fluoroquinolone, is warranted.","Liou, Bo-Huang; Duh, Ruay-Wang; Lin, Yi-Tsung; Yang Lauderdale, Tsai-Ling; Fung, Chang-Phone",J Microbiol Immunol Infect,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1684118213000728; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23751769/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1684118213000728; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmii.2013.04.003,359

This study aimed to assess whether the operational changes put in place to reduce infection risks were effective in engaging and supporting staff. METHODS: Our service’s response saw staff and patients split into morning or afternoon shifts without overlap. Changes included extended clinic hours, modified treatment regimens, expanded online/electronic communication and remote working. Staff were invited to respond to an electronic questionnaire in September 2020, just after the peak of the second COVID‐19 wave in Victoria. Responses captured demographic data, parental status, profession, happiness levels, fear of COVID‐19 and e‐communication efficacy. RESULTS: A 57% response rate was achieved. 69% of respondents were female; 40% were aged 45+ and 35% had school‐aged children. Staff aged 45+ showed a significantly greater fear of COVID‐19 than younger staff. 36% of respondents reported feeling nervous or anxious watching news reports about COVID‐19. 92% of staff were happy with their work arrangements; staff with children were happier than staff without children with their shifts. Online chat/channels were reported as the preferred e‐communication method between colleagues. CONCLUSION: Staff provided predominantly positive feedback to the changes made in response to the pandemic, reporting high levels of happiness and willingness to continue with the changes implemented during COVID‐19. The strategies adopted worked well and the overall high levels of staff satisfaction will allow our service to quickly pivot should further surges, or another pandemic, arise.","Rykers, Kym; Tacey, Mark; Bowes, Jack; Brown, Kerryn; Yuen, Eva; Wilson, Carlene; Khor, Richard; Foroudi, Farshad",J Med Imaging Radiat Oncol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33908186/; https://doi.org/10.1111/1754-9485.13186,359

It may prove especially detrimental in the light of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, as vaccination campaigns still represent the primary strategy against the detrimental consequences of the pandemic. Among patients suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus (DB), who are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19, VH might represent an even more serious threat. Therefore, our study focuses on identifying potential determinants of VH among patients with type 2 diabetes. Study participants (n = 1176) filled in a two-section online self-administered questionnaire, answering questions regarding demographic and anamnestic data, as well as their intention to accept any vaccination against COVID-19. Some possible reasons underlying VH were investigated as well. An overall hesitancy rate of 14.2% was registered. Data showed how older age, male gender, higher education level, and having been vaccinated for seasonal influenza in 2020–2021 were associated with a significantly higher propensity to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. On the contrary, having experienced adverse effects following past vaccinations was a negative predictor. In addition to confirming an array of predictors of VH, we found a worryingly high prevalence of VH among diabetics, who have been shown to be particularly exposed to severe COVID-19 and death. These findings may be useful in planning targeted action toward acceptance improvement and enhancing the efficacy of vaccination campaigns.","Guaraldi, Federica; Montalti, Marco; Di Valerio, Zeno; Mannucci, Edoardo; Nreu, Besmir; Monami, Matteo; Gori, Davide",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9050460; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34064486/,359

Although researchers are exploring the learning affordances associated with VR, research surrounding students’ perceptions of the technology, and intentions to use it for training has been neglected. The goal of this research was to determine the factors that influence students’ intention to use VR in a dynamic learning environment. An extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was developed that incorporates factors related to education and the use of VR technology in training environments. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) processes were employed. Nine of 14 hypotheses in the original model were supported, and eight of the nine predictor factors of the model were determined to directly or indirectly impact behavioral intention (BI). The original TAM factors had the strongest relationships. Relationships between factors particularly relevant to VR technology and learning were also supported.

SARS-CoV-2 has spread to 210 countries worldwide and more than 6,500,000 confirmed cases and 384,643 deaths have been reported, while the number of both confirmed and fatal cases is continually increasing. COVID-19 is a viral disease that can affect every age group—from infants to the elderly—resulting in a wide spectrum of various clinical manifestations. COVID-19 might present different degrees of severity—from mild or even asymptomatic carriers, even to fatal cases. The most common complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome. Fever, dry cough, muscle weakness, and chest pain are the most prevalent and typical symptoms of COVID-19. However, patients might also present atypical symptoms that can occur alone, which might indicate the possible SARS-CoV-2 infection.

For a minority of individuals, excessive use can become problematic and addictive. However, the investigation of problematic internet use in the COVID-19 context is only just emerging. Therefore, the present study investigated the changes in internet use behaviors and addiction rates in comparison with prior Bangladeshi studies. METHODS: An online cross-sectional study was carried out among a total of 601 Bangladeshi students between October 7 and November 2, 2020. The survey included questions relating to socio-demographic, behavioral health, online use behaviors, and psychopathological variables. RESULTS: A quarter of the participants (26%) reported having low levels of internet addiction, whereas 58.6% were classed as having moderate internet addiction and 13% severe internet addiction. A total of 4% of the sample were classed as being at risk of severe internet dependency (ie, scoring over ≥80 on IAT). Risk factors for internet addiction included smartphone addiction, Facebook addiction, depression, and anxiety. However, the final hierarchical regression model comprising all variables explained a total of 70.6% variance of problematic internet use. CONCLUSION: Based on the present findings, it is concluded that individuals are at elevated risk of problematic internet use like other psychological impacts that have been reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, risk-reducing measures and healthy control use strategies should be implemented for vulnerable individuals.","Jahan, Israt; Hosen, Ismail; al Mamun, Firoj; Kaggwa, Mark Mohan; Griffiths, Mark D; Mamun, Mohammed A",Psychol Res Behav Manag,https://doi.org/10.2147/prbm.s323570; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34345189/,359

592673,Commentary: What happens after the lockdown?,2020-05-11,"The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (COVID-19) and has rapidly created a global pandemic. Patients that survive may face a slow recovery with long lasting side effects that can afflict different organs. SARS-CoV-2 primarily infects epithelial airway cells that express the host entry receptor Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2) which binds to spike protein trimers on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 virions. However, SARS-CoV-2 can spread to other tissues even though they are negative for ACE2. To gain insight into the molecular constituents that might influence SARS-CoV-2 tropism, we determined which additional host factors engage with the viral spike protein in disease-relevant human bronchial epithelial cells (16HBEo(−)). We found that spike recruited the extracellular proteins laminin and thrombospondin and was retained in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) by the proteins DJB11 and FBX2 which support re-folding or degradation of nascent proteins in the ER. Because emerging mutations of the spike protein potentially impact the virus tropism, we compared the interactome of D614 spike with that of the rapidly spreading G614 mutated spike. More D614 than G614 spike associated with the proteins UGGT1, calnexin, HSP7A and GRP78/BiP which ensure glycosylation and folding of proteins in the ER. In contrast to G614 spike, D614 spike was endoproteolytically cleaved, and the N-terminal S1 domain was degraded in the ER even though C-terminal ‘S2 only’ proteoforms remained present. D614 spike also bound more laminin than G614 spike, which suggested that extracellular laminins may function as co-factor for an alternative, ‘S2 only’ dependent virus entry. Because the host interactome determines whether an infection is productive, we developed a novel proteome-based cell type set enrichment analysis (pCtSEA). With pCtSEA we determined that the host interactome of the spike protein may extend the tropism of SARS-CoV-2 beyond mucous epithelia to several different cell types, including macrophages and epithelial cells in the nephron. An ‘S2 only’ dependent, alternative infection of additional cell types with SARS-CoV-2 may impact vaccination strategies and may provide a molecular explanation for a severe or prolonged progression of disease in select COVID-19 patients.","Bamberger, Casimir; Pankow, Sandra; Martínez-Bartolomé, Salvador; Diedrich, Jolene; Park, Robin; Yates, John",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33619478/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.16.431318,359

Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) in mesenchymal stem cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) are potential novel therapeutic agents because of their ability to regulate gene expression by inhibiting mRNA. Thus, they may degrade the RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2. EVs can transfer miRNAs to recipient cells and regulate conditions within them. MSC-EVs harbor major therapeutic miRNAs that play important roles in the biological functions of virus-infected host cells. Here, we examined their potential impact on viral and immune responses. MSC-EVs contained 18 miRNAs predicted to interact directly with the 3’ UTR of SARS-CoV-2. These EVs suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication in Vero E6 cells. In addition, five major miRNAs suppressed virus activity in a luciferase reporter assay by binding the 3’ UTR. MSC-EVs showed strong regenerative effects and potent anti-inflammatory activity which may prevent lethal cytokine storms. We confirmed that EVs regulated inflammatory responses by several cell types, including human brain cells that express the viral receptor ACE2, suggesting that the brain may be targeted by SARS-CoV-2. miRNAs in MSC-EVs have several advantages as therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2: 1) they bind specifically to the viral 3’ UTR, and are thus unlikely to have side effects; 2) because the 3’ UTR is highly conserved and rarely mutates, MSC-EV miRNAs could be used against novel variants arising during viral replication; and 3) unique cargoes carried by MSC-EVs can have diverse effects, such as regenerating damaged tissue and regulating immunity.","Park, Jae Hyun; Choi, Yuri; Lim, Chul-Woo; Park, Ji-Min; Yu, Shin-Hye; Kim, Yujin; Han, Hae Jung; Kim, Chun-Hyung; Song, Young-Sook; Kim, Chul; Moon, Jisook",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.27.190561,359

All six freshly synthesized hybrids showed high binding energy as compared to non‐hybrids as well as reference compounds. The presence of substituents at 5‐position of indole enhanced the binding tendency of the ligand. ADME studies indicated good oral bioavailability and absorption of these compounds. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations of hybrids were done at B3LYP/6‐311G++(d,p) level of computation. Their HOMO and LUMO energy plots reflected the presence of high charge transfer and chemical potential. Natural bond order (NBO) calculations predicted hyperconjugative interactions. The Molecular Electrostatic Potential (MEP) surface plots showed possible electrophilic and nucleophilic attacking sites of the hybrids. Compound 10 a (5‐fluoro‐spiro[indol‐indazole‐thiazolidine]‐dione‐coumarin hybrid), on the basis of global reactivity descriptors, was filtered to be chemically most reactive with the highest binding energy of −8.23 kcal/mol with DNA G‐quadruplex. The synthesized hybrid coumarin derivatives in correlation with theoretical docking studies validate that hybrid derivatives are more reactive compared to their non‐hybrid counterparts.","Khanna, Leena; Singhal, Sugandha; Jain, Subhash C.; Khanna, Pankaj",ChemistrySelect,https://doi.org/10.1002/slct.201904783; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32328514/,359
594824,Unraveling COVID-19-related hospital costs: The impact of clinical and demographic conditions,2020-12-30,"Background: There are more than 258 million international migrants worldwide and the majority reside in countries with ongoing novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic outbreaks. International migrants may not receive adequate and timely disease information during epidemics, increasing vulnerability to disease transmission. This is one of very limited studies focusing on international migrants' COVID-19 prevention knowledge and attitudes during the epidemic. Methods: A national cross-sectional online survey was conducted across 100 cities and 26 regions in China from February 17 and March 1, 2020. The sample included 1,426 international migrants representing 77 countries and 6 continents. Knowledge was defined as the number of correct responses to questions about COVID-19. Attitudes included worries, expectations, and general preparedness. Multivariable ordinal logistic regressions evaluated correlates of knowledge and attitudes including information channels and preferences, and trust in Chinese institutions and groups. Results: Just half of the sample, 730/1426 (51.2%) had a good level of knowledge and 656/1426 (46.0%) had a positive attitude towards the COVID-19 epidemic. Knowledge was associated with receiving information through social media (aOR: 2.0, 95%CI: 1.2-3.2), the Internet (aOR: 1.4, 95%CI: 1.2-1.8), the community (aOR: 1.5, 95%CI: 1.2-1.8), and encountering language barriers when receiving medical services (aOR: 0.8, 95%CI: 0.7-1.0). Positive attitude was associated with the level of trust in various Chinese institutions and groups. Conclusions: Roughly half of the sample reported inadequate knowledge and poor attitudes toward prevention and control of COVID-19. Tailored public health campaigns are needed to ensure that international migrants possess adequate knowledge to protect their health during future epidemics and disasters.","Wang, Cheng; Tian, Qi; Zhao, Peizhen; Xiong, Mingzhou; Latkin, Carl A; Gan, Yiqun; Hall, Brian J; Yang, Bin",Int J Biol Sci,https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.47075; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33061804/,359

We audited orders of the Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR platform—the fastest of several other testing modalities available—to illuminate these challenges utilizing a multidisciplinary laboratory professional team consisting of a pathology resident and microbiology lab director. METHODS: Retrospective review of the first five hundred Xpert® Xpress SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test orders from a 2-week period to determine test appropriateness based on the following indications: emergency surgery, emergent obstetric procedures, initial behavioral health admission, and later including discharge to skilled care facilities and pediatric admissions. Our hypothesis was that a significant proportion of orders for this testing platform were inappropriate. RESULTS: Upon review, a significant proportion of orders were incorrect, with 69.8% (n = 349, p < 0.0001) not meeting indications for rapid testing. Of all orders, 249 designated as emergency surgery were inappropriate, with 49.0% of those orders never proceeding with any surgical intervention; most of these were trauma related (64.6% were orders associated with a trauma unit). CONCLUSIONS: Significant, pervasive inappropriate ordering practices were identified at this center.

The wide variety of skin presentations has delayed linking these to the virus. Previous studies had attempted to look at the prevalence and timing of SARS-COV-2 rashes but were based on mostly hospitalized severe cases and had little follow up. Using data collected on a subset of 336,847 eligible UK users of the COVID Symptom Study app, we observed that 8.8% of the swab positive cases (total: 2,021 subjects) reported either a body rash or an acral rash, compared to 5.4% of those with a negative swab test (total: 25,136). Together, these two skin presentations showed an odds ratio (OR) of 1.67 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.41-1.96) for being swab positive. Skin rashes were also predictive in the larger untested group of symptomatic app users (N=54,652), as 8.2% of those who had reported at least one classical COVID-19 symptom, i.e., fever, persistent cough, and/or anosmia, also reported a rash. Data from an independent online survey of 11,546 respondents with a rash showed that in 17% of swab positive cases, the rash was the initial presentation. Furthermore, in 21%, the rash was the only clinical sign. Skin rashes cluster with other COVID-19 symptoms, are predictive of a positive swab test and occur in a significant number of cases, either alone or before other classical symptoms. Recognising rashes is important in identifying new and earlier COVID-19 cases.","Bataille, V.; Visconti, A.; Rossi, N.; Murray, B.; Bournot, A.; Wolf, J.; Ourselin, S.; Steves, C.; Spector, T.; Falchi, M.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.10.20150656; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.10.20150656v1?rss=1,359

596503,"A multi-component, community-based strategy to facilitate COVID-19 vaccine uptake among Latinx populations: From theory to practice",2021-09-20,"BACKGROUND: A growing number of adolescents are coming out as transgender and gender expansive (TGE). These teenagers have been shown to have significantly worse health outcomes than their cisgender peers. Hypotheses to explain this discrepancy are based on increased stress levels surrounding the societal acceptance of gender identity. In this context, elevated allostatic load (AL), which describes the wear and tear sustained by the body in response to repeated exposure to stress, has been associated with adverse long-term health outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This protocol aims to measure AL among TGE adolescents compared with their cisgender peers and assess how AL varies depending on psychological stress and perceived societal acceptance. METHODS: This is an observational proof-of-concept pilot study in which AL will be measured by assaying an array of inflammatory cytokines and cortisol in urine, saliva, and hair samples of TGE youth, and these parameters will be compared with those of age-matched control participants. A questionnaire will assess 4 aspects of psychosocial well-being: presence and management of depression and anxiety, gender identity support by family members, gender minority stress, and degree of perceived safety in the surrounding community. Samples and surveys will be collected at 3 visits (baseline, 6 months, and 12 months). This study will incorporate TGE coinvestigators to inform all aspects of design, data collection, and analysis and ensure that practices are carried out in a respectful and sensitive manner. RESULTS: As of May 2021, the start of data collection for this project has continued to be postponed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has both impacted the functioning of the clinic and funding requests. We hope to begin participant recruitment and interviews with coinvestigators soon. CONCLUSIONS: We hypothesize that AL will be primarily influenced by psychological well-being and perceived support and that it will be similar in TGE adolescents and in age-matched cisgender control participants when acceptance and perceived support are high. The results of this study have the potential to increase our understanding of the health challenges faced by TGE individuals during adolescence as well as to show that low levels of acceptance may have detrimental health outcomes secondary to elevated ALs; this may lead to the development of a biomarker profile to assess allostatic stress in TGE patients that can be used to guide management.

597138,COVID-19-associated mucormycosis: looking for the culprit!,2021-10-02,"Pattern recognition receptors, such as toll‐like receptors (TLRs), perceive tissue alterations and initiate local innate immune responses. Microglia, the resident macrophages of the brain, encode TLRs which primary role is to protect the tissue integrity. However, deregulated activation of TLRs in microglia may lead to chronic neurodegeneration. This double role of microglial responses is often reported in immune‐driven neurologic diseases, as in multiple sclerosis (MS). Consequently, strategies to manipulate microglia inflammatory responses may help to ameliorate disease progression. In this context, the anti‐inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)‐10 appears as an attractive target. In this study, we investigated how activation of microglia by TLRs with distinct roles in MS impacts on IL‐10 production. We found that activation of TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 induced the production of IL‐10 to a greater extent than activation of TLR3. This was surprising as both TLR3 and IL‐10 play protective roles in animal models of MS. Interestingly, combination of TLR3 triggering with the other TLRs, enhanced IL‐10 through the modulation of its transcription, via interferon (IFN)‐β, but independently of IL‐27. Thus, in addition to the modulation of inflammatory responses of the periphery described for the axis TLR3/IFN‐β, we now report a direct modulation of microglial responses. We further show that the presence of IFN‐γ in the microenvironment abrogated the modulation of IL‐10 by TLR3, whereas that of IL‐17 had no effect. Considering the therapeutic application of IFN‐β in MS, our study bears important implications for the understanding of the cytokine network regulating microglia responses in this setting.","Lobo‐Silva, Diogo; Carriche, Guilhermina M.; Castro, A.

Human bocavirus was detected using the respiratory virus panel fast assay and real-time PCR. Of the 1,823 nasopharyngeal samples, 104 (5.7%) were positive for hBoV; a similar prevalence was observed in all three periods studied. Among hBoV-infected children, 53.8% were between 1–2 years old, and hBoV was detected alone in 57/104 (54.8%) cases. All of the detected hBoV strains belonged to genotype 1. The median hBoV load was significantly higher in samples containing strains with both the N546H and T590S mutations compared to other samples (p<0.05). Children with a single hBoV-1 infection more frequently had upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) than those who were co-infected (37.0% vs 17.8%, respectively, p = 0.04). The duration of hospitalization was longer among children with high viral loads than that observed among children with low viral loads (8.0 ±2.2 days vs 5.0 ±1.5 days, respectively, p = 0.03), and the use of aerosol therapy was more frequent among children with high viral loads than among those with low viral loads (77.1% vs 55.7%, respectively, p = 0.04). This study shows that hBoV is a relatively uncommon but stable infectious agent in children and that hBoV1 seems to be the only strain detected in Italy in respiratory samples. From a clinical point of view, hBoV1 seems to have in the majority of healthy children relatively low clinical relevance. Moreover, the viral load influences only the duration of hospitalization and the use of aerosol therapy without any association with the site of the respiratory disease.","Principi, Nicola; Piralla, Antonio; Zampiero, Alberto; Bianchini, Sonia; Umbrello, Giulia; Scala, Alessia; Bosis, Samantha; Fossali, Emilio; Baldanti, Fausto; Esposito, Susanna",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0135640; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26267139/,359

A broad group of delegates of scientific professional societies and cancer organisations endorse the principles of the WHO call to eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem, also in Europe. All European nations should, by 2030, reach at least 90% HPV vaccine coverage among girls by the age of 15 years and also boys, if cost‐effective; they should introduce organised population‐based HPV‐based screening and achieve 70% of screening coverage in the target age group, providing also HPV testing on self‐samples for nonscreened or underscreened women; and to manage 90% of screen‐positive women. To guide member states, a group of scientific professional societies and cancer organisations engage to assist in the rollout of a series of concerted evidence‐based actions. European health authorities are requested to mandate a group of experts to develop the third edition of European Guidelines for Quality Assurance of Cervical Cancer prevention based on integrated HPV vaccination and screening and to monitor the progress towards the elimination goal.

The use of venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) for the management of postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock is controversial, and there are at least three scenarios where it may be necessary: first, pre-emptive postoperative VA-ECMO, where the decision for postoperative mechanical support is made prior to surgery, for example, in the context of poor pre-operative cardiac function; second, early yet unplanned post-cardiopulmonary bypass VA-ECMO following a long duration of cardiopulmonary bypass due to, for example, unexpected surgical complications; third, late rescue VA-ECMO following several attempts at weaning, either immediately following cardiopulmonary bypass or following transfer to the intensive care unit. The use of mechanical circulatory support for postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock is further complicated by the wide range of available devices, the availability of VA-ECMO in different centres, variations in experience and expertise as a function of local VA-ECMO workload, and regional variations in the diagnosis and management of postcardiotomy cardiogenic shock. Furthermore, survival appears to be low for such patients and it is not yet possible to predict who will survive. Many questions remain, however, such as those in relation to practices around patient selection, how best to study long-term outcomes, the ethics and efficacy of ECMO in such patients, and on all aspects of clinical decision-making.

Bronchoscopy is associated with increased risk of patient‐to‐health care worker transmission, owing to aerosolized viral particles which may be inhaled and also result in environmental contamination of surfaces. METHODS: We describe our experience with the use of modified full‐face snorkeling masks for pediatric bronchoscopy procedures in four COVID‐19 infected children when filtering facepieces/respirators were in limited supply. RESULTS: Bronchoscopy was urgently required in four children, and could not be delayed until COVID‐19 test results were available. During the pandemic peak, when respirators were in short supply, modified full‐face snorkel masks (SEAC Libera, SEAC, Italy) were worn by the bronchoscopy team. Each mask was fitted with an O‐ring, adapter, and heat and moisture exchanger filter. To date, there have been no COVID‐19 infections among the bronchoscopy team staff, whereas the overall Hospital staff COVID‐19 prevalence rate has exceeded 13.5% (667/4949). CONCLUSION: Emergency bronchoscopy procedures on COVID‐19 infected patients or patients with unknown infection status can be safely performed using modified full‐face snorkel masks.","Goussard, Pierre; Van Wyk, Lizelle; Burke, Jonathan; Malherbe, Annemie; Retief, Francois; Andronikou, Savvas; Mfingwana, Lunga; Ruttens, Dries; Van der Zalm, Marieke; Dramowski, Angela; Da Costa, Aishah; Rabie, Helena",Pediatr Pulmonol,https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.25015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767742/,359
599395,Effectiveness of quarantine measure on transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in Hong Kong,2020-04-11,"When the population risk factors and reporting systems are similar, the assessment of the case-fatality (or lethality) rate (ratio of cases to deaths) represents a perfect tool for analyzing, understanding and improving the overall efficiency of the health system. The objective of this article is to estimate the influence of the hospital care system on lethality in metropolitan France during the inception of the COVID-19 epidemic, by analyzing the spatial variability of the hospital case-fatality rate (CFR) between French districts. In theory, the hospital age-standardized CFR should not display significant differences between districts, since hospital lethality depends on the virulence of the pathogen (the SARS-CoV-2 virus), the vulnerability of the population (mainly age-related), the healthcare system quality, and cases and deaths definition and the recording accuracy. We analyzed hospital data on COVID-19 hospitalizations, severity (admission to intensive care units for reanimation or endotracheal intubation) and mortality, from March 19 to May 8 corresponding to the first French lockdown. All rates were age-standardized to eliminate differences in districts age structure. The results show that the higher case-fatality rates observed by districts are mostly related to the level of morbidity. Time analysis shows that the case-fatality rate has decreased over time, globally and in almost all districts, showing an improvement in the management of severe patients during the epidemic. In conclusion, it appears that during the first critical phase of COVID-19 ramping epidemic in metropolitan France, the higher case-fatality rates were generally related to the higher level of hospitalization, then potentially related to the overload of healthcare system. Also, low hospitalization with high case-fatality rates were mostly found in districts with low population density, and could due to some limitation of the local healthcare access. However, the magnitude of this increase of case-fatality rate represents less than 10 per cent of the average case-fatality rate, and this variation is small compared to much greater variation across countries reported in the literature.","Souris, Marc; Gonzalez, Jean-Paul",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33320895/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0243606,359

In GAV-infected shrimp, positively reacting tissues included: lymphoid organ, gills, antennal gland, and cuticular epithelium of the stomach. This demonstrates that a YHV probe can be used as a diagnostic tool for GAV and supports previous suggestions that these two viruses are closely related.","Tang, Kathy F.-J; Spann, Kirsten M; Owens, Leigh; Lightner, Donald V",Aquaculture,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0044-8486(01)00666-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32336809/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0044848601006664; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0044848601006664,359

The field measurement was conducted to collect dust in filter screen, surface cooler and air supply duct of two air handling units (AHUs). The results indicate that dust volume and fungal number in two AHUs generally met the hygienic specification of public buildings, but the cleansing did not fulfil requirements. High-throughput sequencing was conducted, revealing that the dominant fungal species were Alternaria_betae-kenyensis, Cladosporium_delicatulum, Aspergillus_sydowii, Verticillium_dahliae. Laboratory experiment was conducted to analyze the impact of several factors (e.g. growth time, temperature, relative humidity, duct material) and their combination on the DAF growth. The results indicate that fungal growth increased with time, peaking at 4 days or 5 days. Higher relative humidity or temperature was conducive to fungal growth. The orthogonal experiment revealed that the condition of “antibacterial composite, 22 ± 1 °C and 45%–55% RH” had the strongest inhibiting impact on fungal growth. Logistic model, Gompertz model and square-root model were further developed to predict the fungal growth under different conditions. The results show that the Logistic model had high feasibility and accuracy, the Gompertz model was feasible with lower accuracy and the square-root model was feasible with high accuracy. Overall, this study facilitates the understanding of the DAF growth in air-conditioning ducts, which is important for real-time prediction and timely control of the fungal contamination.","Liu, Zhijian; Deng, Yuzhu; Ma, Shengyuan; He, Bao-Jie; Cao, Guoqing",Build Simul,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12273-020-0693-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32983398/,359

600391,Evaluation of indoor hospital acclimatization of body temperature before COVID-19 fever screening,2021-02-25,"BACKGROUND: Sequence-specific PCR is the most common approach for virus identification in diagnostic laboratories. However, as specific PCR only detects pre-defined targets, novel virus strains or viruses not included in routine test panels will be missed. Recently, advances in high-throughput sequencing allow for virus-sequence-independent identification of entire virus populations in clinical samples, yet standardized protocols are needed to allow broad application in clinical diagnostics. Here, we describe a comprehensive sample preparation protocol for high-throughput metagenomic virus sequencing using random amplification of total nucleic acids from clinical samples. RESULTS: In order to optimize metagenomic sequencing for application in virus diagnostics, we tested different enrichment and amplification procedures on plasma samples spiked with RNA and DNA viruses. A protocol including filtration, nuclease digestion, and random amplification of RNA and DNA in separate reactions provided the best results, allowing reliable recovery of viral genomes and a good correlation of the relative number of sequencing reads with the virus input. We further validated our method by sequencing a multiplexed viral pathogen reagent containing a range of human viruses from different virus families. Our method proved successful in detecting the majority of the included viruses with high read numbers and compared well to other protocols in the field validated against the same reference reagent. Our sequencing protocol does work not only with plasma but also with other clinical samples such as urine and throat swabs. CONCLUSIONS: The workflow for virus metagenomic sequencing that we established proved successful in detecting a variety of viruses in different clinical samples. Our protocol supplements existing virus-specific detection strategies providing opportunities to identify atypical and novel viruses commonly not accounted for in routine diagnostic panels.

To monitor test quality and evaluate NAT kits, quality control materials that best simulate real clinical samples are needed in this study, the performance of SARS-CoV-2 cell culture supernatant, PCDH-based pseudovirus, and MS2-based pseudovirus as quality control materials was compared. As a result, PCDH-based pseudovirus was more similar in characteristics to SARS-CoV-2 particle, and was more suitable for evaluating SARS-CoV-2 NAT kits than MS2-based pseudovirus. Proper detection using sensitive and precise NAT kits is essential to guarantee diagnosis. Thus, limit of detection, precision, anti-inference ability and cross-reactivity of NAT kits from PerkinElmer, Wantai, Shanghai Kehua Bio-Engineering (KHB), Sansure, Da An, BioGerm, and Applied Biological Technologies (ABT) were compared using PCDH-based pseudovirus. For the seven kits evaluated, N gene was more sensitive than ORF1ab gene in most kits, while E gene was most sensitive among the three genes in KHB and ABT. PerkinElmer got the lowest LoD for N gene at 11.61 copies/mL, and 34.66 copies/mL for ORF1ab gene. All the kits showed good precision with CV values less than 5%, as well as acceptable anti-interference ability of 2 mg/L human genomic DNA.

With minimal notice, experiments were terminated, cell lines were frozen, mouse colonies were culled, and trainees were prevented from performing bench research. Still, despite the interruption of experimental productivity, the shutdown has proven for many PIs and trainees that doing and thinking science are not activities that are bound to the laboratory. Furthermore, the shutdowns have solidified important emerging trends and forced us to further innovate to get the most out of working remotely.

From the nasopharyngeal or conjunctival mucosa of infected individuals, RSV spreads to the lower respiratory tract causing acute bronchiolitis and pneumonia after an incubation period of 4 to 6 days. In addition to its well-documented tropism for the airway epithelium, it has been shown previously that RSV can also spread hematogenously and efficiently infect extrapulmonary tissues of human hosts. Furthermore, it has been shown in animal models that RSV can spread transplacentally from the respiratory tract of a pregnant mother to the lungs of the fetus. This report describes a documented case of neonatal RSV infection strongly suggestive of prenatal transmission of this infection in humans from an infected mother to her offspring.","Manti, Sara; Cuppari, Caterina; Lanzafame, Angela; Salpietro, Carmelo; Betta, Pasqua; Leonardi, Salvatore; Perez, Miriam K.; Piedimonte, Giovanni",Pediatric Pulmonology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28834426/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.23775,359

However, there have been no reported cases with positive GM1 or GQ1b antibodies in the literature to date. Although clinically similar, the pathophysiology of COVID-19 related GBS and MFS may be significantly different from cases in the pre-pandemic era. CASE PRESENTATION: We present a patient with ascending areflexic weakness consistent with GBS with positive GM1 antibody. The patient had recovered from COVID-19 infection two weeks prior with mild viral illness and symptoms. Her weakness was isolated to the lower extremities and improved after intravenous immunoglobulin treatment. Patient recovered eventually. CONCLUSIONS: – The general lack of reported ganglioside antibodies supports a novel target(s) for molecular mimicry as the underlying etiology, which raises the concern for possible vaccine induced complication. Whether the current GM1 positive case is a sequalae of COVID-19 or a mere coincidence is inconclusive.

We aimed to quantitatively measure self-reported metrics of fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and sleep and identify factors associated with these metrics among United States residents with or without COVID-19. METHODS: We solicited 1000 adult United States residents for an online survey conducted February 3–5, 2021 utilizing a commercial crowdsourcing community research platform. The platform curates eligible participants to approximate United States demographics by age, sex, and race proportions. COVID-19 was diagnosed by laboratory testing and/or by exposure to a known positive contact with subsequent typical symptoms. Prolonged COVID-19 was self-reported and coded for those with symptoms ≥ 1 month following initial diagnosis. The primary outcomes were NIH PROMIS/Neuro-QoL short-form T-scores for fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and sleep compared among those with prolonged COVID-19 symptoms, COVID-19 without prolonged symptoms and COVID-19 negative subjects. Multivariable backwards step-wise logistic regression models were constructed to predict abnormal Neuro-QoL metrics. RESULTS: Among 999 respondents, the average age was 45 years (range 18–84), 49% were male, 76 (7.6%) had a history of COVID-19 and 19/76 (25%) COVID-19 positive participants reported prolonged symptoms lasting a median of 4 months (range 1–13). Prolonged COVID-19 participants were more often younger, female, Hispanic, and had a history of depression/mood/thought disorder (all P < 0.05). They experienced significantly higher rates of unemployment and financial insecurity, and their symptoms created greater interference with work and household activities compared to other COVID-19 status groups (all P < 0.05). After adjusting for demographics, past medical history and stressor covariates in multivariable logistic regression analysis, COVID-19 status was independently predictive of worse Neuro-QoL cognitive dysfunction scores (adjusted OR 11.52, 95% CI 1.01–2.28, P = 0.047), but there were no significant differences in quantitative measures of anxiety, depression, fatigue, or sleep. CONCLUSION: Prolonged symptoms occurred in 25% of COVID-19 positive participants, and NeuroQoL cognitive dysfunction scores were significantly worse among COVID-19 positive subjects, even after accounting for demographic and stressor covariates. Fatigue, anxiety, depression, and sleep scores did not differ between COVID-19 positive and negative respondents.","Frontera, Jennifer A.; Lewis, Ariane; Melmed, Kara; Lin, Jessica; Kondziella, Daniel; Helbok, Raimund; Yaghi, Shadi; Meropol, Sharon; Wisniewski, Thomas; Balcer, Laura; Galetta, Steven L.",Front Aging Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34349633/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2021.690383,359

Growing epidemiological studies have depicted atherosclerosis as a comorbid factor of COVID-19. Though both these diseases are triggered via inflammatory rage that leads to injury of healthy tissues, the molecular linkage between them and their co-influence in causing fatality is not understood. METHODS: We have retrieved the data of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for both atherosclerosis and COVID-19 from publicly available microarray and RNA-Seq datasets. We then reconstructed the protein-protein interaction networks (PPIN) for these diseases from protein-protein interaction data of corresponding DEGs. Using RegNetwork and TRRUST, we mapped the transcription factors (TFs) in atherosclerosis and their targets (TGs) in COVID-19 PPIN. RESULTS: From the atherosclerotic PPIN, we have identified 6 hubs (TLR2, TLR4, EGFR, SPI1, MYD88 and IRF8) as differentially expressed TFs that might control the expression of their 17 targets in COVID-19 PPIN. The important target proteins include IL1B, CCL5, ITGAM, IFIT3, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3 and CXCL8. Consequent functional enrichment analysis of these TGs have depicted inflammatory responses to be overrepresented among the gene sets. CONCLUSION: Finally, analyzing the DEGs in cardiomyocytes infected with SARS-CoV-2, we have concluded that MYD88 is a crucial linker of atherosclerosis and COVID-19, the co-existence of which lead to fatal outcomes. Anti-inflammatory therapy targeting MYD88 could be a potent strategy for combating this comorbidity.","Das, Deepyaman; Podder, Soumita",Comput Biol Med,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482521002535?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482521002535; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104459; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34020127/,359

603802,COVID 19 vaccination lessons from Japanese anti-HPV vaccination lobby,2020-07-05,"BACKGROUND: Pandemic events often trigger a surge of clinical trial activity aimed at rapidly evaluating therapeutic or preventative interventions. Ensuring rapid public access to the complete and unbiased trial record is particularly critical for pandemic research given the urgent associated public health needs. The World Health Organization (WHO) established standards requiring posting of results to a registry within 12 months of trial completion and publication in a peer reviewed journal within 24 months of completion, though compliance with these requirements among pandemic trials is unknown. METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis characterizes availability of results in trial registries and publications among registered trials performed during the 2009 H1N1 influenza, 2014 Ebola, and 2016 Zika pandemics. We searched trial registries to identify clinical trials testing interventions related to these pandemics, and determined the time elapsed between trial completion and availability of results in the registry. We also performed a comprehensive search of MEDLINE via PubMed, Google Scholar, and EMBASE to identify corresponding peer reviewed publications. The primary outcome was the compliance with either of the WHO’s established standards for sharing clinical trial results. Secondary outcomes included compliance with both standards, and assessing the time elapsed between trial completion and public availability of results. RESULTS: Three hundred thirty-three trials met eligibility criteria, including 261 H1N1 influenza trials, 60 Ebola trials, and 12 Zika trials. Of these, 139 (42%) either had results available in the trial registry within 12 months of study completion or had results available in a peer-reviewed publication within 24 months. Five trials (2%) met both standards. No results were available in either a registry or publication for 59 trials (18%). Among trials with registered results, a median of 42 months (IQR 16–76 months) elapsed between trial completion and results posting. For published trials, the median elapsed time between completion and publication was 21 months (IQR 9–34 months). Results were available within 24 months of study completion in either the trial registry or a peer reviewed publication for 166 trials (50%).

604662,Letter: Neurosurgery and Coronavirus (COVID-19) Epidemic: Doing our Part,2020-04-15,"The COVID-19 pandemic has infected tens of millions of people worldwide causing many deaths. Healthcare systems have been stretched caring for the most seriously ill and lockdown measures to interrupt COVID-19 transmission have had adverse economic and societal impacts. Large-scale population vaccination is seen as the solution. In the UK, a network of sites to deploy vaccines comprised National Health Service hospitals, primary care and new mass vaccination centres. Due to the pace at which mass vaccination centres were established and the scale of vaccine deployment, some sites experienced problems with queues and waiting times. To address this, one site used the Lean systematic improvement approach to make rapid operational improvements to reduce process times and improve flow. The case example identifies obstacles to flow experienced by a mass vaccination centre and how they were addressed using Lean concepts and techniques. Process cycle times were used as a proxy metric for efficiency and flow. Based on daily demand volume and open hours, takt time was calculated to give a process completion rate to achieve flow through the vaccination centre. The mass vaccination centre achieved its aim of reducing process times and improving flow.

Acute cardiac related injury (ACRI) is common in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Objective: To explain the pathological mechanism of ACRI and improve the treatment strategy by retrospectively observing the factors associated with ACRI and factors affecting the prognosis of ACRI with COVID-19 at an early stage. Methods: 619 COVID-19 patients were from Tongji Hospital, Wuhan. T test was used for continuous variables while Chi-square test for categorical factors. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were applied to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: Among the 619 OOS Level-I hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 102 (16.5%) were defined as ACRI (stage-1: 59 cases, stage-2: 43 cases). 50% of ACRI patients developed into severe cases and 25 patients died (CFR=24.5%), 42 times that of non-ACRI patients. Elderly (OR=2.83, P<0.001) , HTN (OR=2.09, P=0.005), {gamma}-globulin (OR=2.08, P=0.004), TCM (OR=0.55, P=0.017), PLT (OR=2.94, P<0.001) and NLR (OR=2.20, P=0.004) were independently correlated with ACRI. SBP[≥]140, dyspnea, DM, smoking history were correlated with ACRI-stage2 only. In the prognostic subgroup analysis of ACRI patients,{gamma}-globulin treatment could prolong LOS. TCM (OR=0.26, P=0.006), SBP[≥]160 (OR= 22.70, P=0.005), male (OR=2.66, P=0.044) were associated with severe illness while corticosteroids treatment (OR=3.34, P=0.033) and male (OR=4.303, P=0.008) with death. Surprisingly, we found the mortality of non-elderly patients is higher than elderly (32.4% VS 20.0%, P=0.164), and both IKF and RASI treatment were not correlated with any prognostic indicators including severe, death and LOS. Conclusion: This study observed that several non-traditional issues were associated with early cardiac injury in COVID-19 while many traditional cardiovascular risk factors were not. Besides elderly and male, hypertension was confirmed to be the most important risk factor.","Xie, Y.; Chen, S.; Wang, X.; Li, B.; Zhang, T.; He, X.; Sun, N.; Wang, L.; Zeng, H.; Shen, Y.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.06.20147256; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.07.06.20147256v1?rss=1,359

Viral apoptotic mimicry, defined by the exposure of phosphatidylserine — a marker for apoptosis — on the pathogen surface, is emerging as a common theme used by enveloped viruses to promote infection. Focusing on the four best described examples (vaccinia virus, dengue virus, Ebola virus and pseudotyped lentivirus), we summarize our current understanding of apoptotic mimicry as a mechanism for virus entry, binding and immune evasion. We also describe recent examples of non-enveloped viruses that use this mimicry strategy, and discuss future directions and how viral apoptotic mimicry could be targeted therapeutically.

Annals of Surgery 2021;274: 45-49",2021,"Abstract Land in urban fringe area is the primary source for land supply and development. In Hong Kong (HK), nine new towns have been built in New Territories since 1970s, providing 172.6 km2 built-up land and large amount of residences for 3.4 million people. However, due to land scarcity, development restriction, and social opposition, New Development Area (NDA), as the small-scale extension of New Town (NT), was designated as one of the main approaches for HK medium and long term land supply. To demonstrate the characteristics of urban fringe land use transitions in Hong Kong, literature review and case study were used in this research. The history of new town development and the scheme of new development areas were introduced firstly. Afterwards, the land use features of NT and NDA were compared and the case of Hung Shui Kiu NDA was illustrated. It is concluded that while housing, infrastructure and facility were the main elements in NTs, employment, vibrancy and environment were suggested to be the new compulsory elements in NDAs integrated to the traditional planning concepts. As for the development approach, lease modification was adopted in NDA to allow private landowners directly develop their land, in addition to the traditional development approach of land resumption in NT. It is suggested to ensure the development of NDA, the proposed development plan should be persuasive to provide the optimal land use distribution as a trade-off among the profits of developers, the interests of local villager, government concern and the provision of land for future residents. Also, community engagement will play a more important role in NDA planning process. Referring to the analysis of urban fringe land use transitions and strategies for planning and development, the study would also be helpful to others growing cities.","Wang, A.

OBJECTIVE: To report our experience with critically ill children with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We reviewed the medical records of children with COVID-19 who were admitted Feb. 25 to May 1, 2020. We reviewed patient demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, requirement for respiratory support, evidence of acute myocardial injury, and chest radiographs. RESULTS: The study included 19 children and adolescents (ages 2 months to 18 years, median 8 years; 10 males, 9 females; 18 COVID-19-positive, 1 COVID-19-negative with positive exposure). Presenting symptoms included fever (89%), cough (68%), respiratory distress (68%) and vomiting/diarrhea (47%). Comorbidities were present in 12 (63%). Fourteen required intensive care; eight required intubation. Two children died. Five patients developed acute myocarditis (median age 7 years); in all five, chest radiographs were notable for cardiomegaly and pulmonary congestion or interstitial edema. Of these five, one (age 18 years), who had underlying hypertension and obesity, developed multifocal pneumonia and renal failure. The other four were previously healthy; three (ages 5 years, 7 years, 8 years) were subsequently diagnosed with multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C); one developed pulmonary opacities consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome, three (60%) had no parenchymal pulmonary opacities. Fourteen patients (median 13 years), most with comorbidities, had no acute myocardial injury. Chest radiographs in 13 (93%) demonstrated parenchymal lung disease with a predominant perihilar and basilar distribution. CONCLUSION: Myocarditis without pulmonary disease occurred in children in their first decade as a component of MIS-C, a newly described syndrome of multisystemic inflammation requiring further investigation. Pulmonary disease dominated the radiographic features of COVID-19-positive adolescents in their second decade in whom radiographs demonstrated predominantly perihilar and basilar distribution of lung opacities.","Blumfield, Einat; Levin, Terry L.",Pediatr Radiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00247-020-04782-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32728901/,359

However, its application against glioma is still in its infancy. In this study, the applicable candidates were excavated for mRNA vaccine treatment in the perspective of immune regulation, and suitable glioma recipients with corresponding immune subtypes were further investigated. METHODS: The RNA-seq data and clinical information of 702 and 325 patients were recruited from TCGA and CGGA, separately. The genetic alteration profile was visualized and compared by cBioPortal. Then, we explored prognostic outcomes and immune correlations of the selected antigens to validate their clinical relevance. The prognostic index was measured via GEPIA2, and infiltration of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) was calculated and visualized by TIMER. Based on immune-related gene expression, immune subtypes of glioma were identified using consensus clustering analysis. Moreover, the immune landscape was visualized by graph learning-based dimensionality reduction analysis. RESULTS: Four glioma antigens, namely ANXA5, FKBP10, MSN, and PYGL, associated with superior prognoses and infiltration of APCs were selected. Three immune subtypes IS1–IS3 were identified, which fundamentally differed in molecular, cellular, and clinical signatures. Patients in subtypes IS2 and IS3 carried immunologically cold phenotypes, whereas those in IS1 carried immunologically hot phenotype. Particularly, patients in subtypes IS3 and IS2 demonstrated better outcomes than that in IS1. Expression profiles of immune checkpoints and immunogenic cell death (ICD) modulators showed a difference among IS1–IS3 tumors. Ultimately, the immune landscape of glioma elucidated considerable heterogeneity not only between individual patients but also within the same immune subtype. CONCLUSIONS: ANXA5, FKBP10, MSN, and PYGL are identified as potential antigens for anti-glioma mRNA vaccine production, specifically for patients in immune subtypes 2 and 3. In summary, this study may shed new light on the promising approaches of immunotherapy, such as devising mRNA vaccination tailored to applicable glioma recipients.","Zhong, Hua; Liu, Shuai; Cao, Fang; Zhao, Yi; Zhou, Jianguo; Tang, Feng; Peng, Zhaohua; Li, Yangsheng; Xu, Shen; Wang, Chunlin; Yang, Guohua; Li, Zhi-Qiang",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34512630/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.709986,359

606949,COVID-19 Vaccination: prioritization of at risk groups,2021-04-08,"INTRODUCTION: Previous research has established an association between changes to the daily routine of individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and increase in maladaptive behaviours. The relationship between maladaptive behaviours in autistic individuals and increase in care burden among their caregivers is also well established. However, no study has yet examined these associations in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The main aim of this study was to explore the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on autistic individuals and their caregivers. METHODS: A questionnaire-based cross-sectional study conducted with the caregivers of 58 autistic individuals across the mental health services at Hamad Medical Corporation, Doha, Qatar. The extent of care burden was measured using the Care Burden Interview, whereas changes in behaviour in autistic individuals was assessed using the Revised Overt Aggression Scale. RESULTS: A total of 58 caregivers participated in the study. Out of these, 24 (41%) reported a clinically significant increase in their care burden. Among caregivers reporting an increase in care burden, two-third were caring for individuals whose behaviour either remained unchanged or improved during social restrictions. Nine autistic people (15.5%) were reported to have no aggression prior to the implementation of COVID-19 social restrictions compared to 13 (22.4%) individuals during COVID-19 social restrictions. Minimal, mild and moderate aggression were reported in 27 (46.6%), 21 (36.2%), and 1 (1.7%) patients respectively, before COVID-19 social restrictions compared to 29 (50%), 15 (25.9), and 1 (1.7%) during COVID-19 restrictions. Severe aggression was not reported in any patient either before or during COVID-19 social restrictions. CONCLUSION: This study showed reduced levels of aggression in autistic individuals but an increase in care burden among their caregivers during the COVID-19 social restrictions highlighting the need of supporting patients and caregivers alike.","Khan, Yasser Saeed; Khan, Abdul Waheed; Tahir, Mohamed El; Hammoudeh, Samer; Shamlawi, Mahmoud Al; Alabdulla, Majid",Res Dev Disabil,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34624722/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ridd.2021.104090; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891422221002390?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0891422221002390,359

Home‐based therapies could address this need, but they don’t typically address abnormal muscle co‐activation, an important aspect of arm impairment. An earlier study using lab‐based, myoelectric computer interface game training enabled chronic stroke survivors to reduce abnormal co‐activation and improve arm function. Here, we assess feasibility of doing this training at home using a novel, wearable, myoelectric interface for neurorehabilitation training (MINT) paradigm. OBJECTIVE: Assess tolerability and feasibility of home‐based, high‐dose MINT therapy in severely impaired chronic stroke survivors. METHODS: Twenty‐three participants were instructed to train with the MINT and game for 90 min/day, 36 days over 6 weeks. We assessed feasibility using amount of time trained and game performance. We assessed tolerability (enjoyment and effort) using a customized version of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory at the conclusion of training. RESULTS: Participants displayed high adherence to near‐daily therapy at home (mean of 82 min/day of training; 96% trained at least 60 min/day) and enjoyed the therapy. Training performance improved and co‐activation decreased with training. Although a substantial number of participants stopped training, most dropouts were due to reasons unrelated to the training paradigm itself. INTERPRETATION: Home‐based therapy with MINT is feasible and tolerable in severely impaired stroke survivors. This affordable, enjoyable, and mobile health paradigm has potential to improve recovery from stroke in a variety of settings.

When considered with the hydropathicity plot analysis of the amino acid sequence of M (Boursnell, M.E.G. et al., 1984, Virus Res. 1, 303–313) these results suggest that as few as 9–20 N-terminal amino acid residues may protrude at the outer membrane surface and that there is a highly protease sensitive sequence of an estimated 20–25 residues at the C-terminus of M exposed in the lumen of the virion. S2 but not SI was cleaved to a major glycopolypeptide of approximately 71K by several proteases, and to 76K by trypsin. N-terminal sequencing of the 71K glycopolypeptide revealed that it had the same N-terminus as intact S2. After hydrolysis in the presence and absence of saponin it was concluded that S2 is very sensitive to hydrolysis near its carboxy terminus at residues close to the outer membrane surface.","Cavanagh, David; Davis, Philip J.; Pappin, Darryl J.C.",Virus Research,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0168170286900389; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3010596/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0168170286900389,359

We examined using ICR mice whether the amino acids mutated in the mutants were involved in the neurovirulence. Srr7 showed apparently reduced neurovirulence relative to the wild-type (wt) JHMV in terms of the LD(50) and survival time, while the others showed slightly reduced virulence. In the brain and spinal cord, the growth of srr7 was more than 2log(10) lower than that of the wt virus. Histopathologically, no significant difference was revealed between wt and srr7-infected mice on day 2 postinoculation (p.i.), with only scant inflammation and a minimum degree of neuropathological changes. The major difference was that apoptotic cells were frequently encountered in the srr7-infected mouse brain, but not in wt-infected mice on day 2 p.i. However, there was no difference between these viruses in the potential to induce apoptosis in cultured cells. The apoptosis in the brain did not appear to result from the direct viral attack, since apoptotic cells were found in the lesion where viral antigens were barely detected. The present study suggests that the amino acids mutated in the S protein of srr mutants, especially the amino acid at position 1114 mutated in srr7, influence the neurovirulence in mice.","Matsuyama, S.; Watanabe, R.; Taguchi, F.",Arch Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11699952/,359
608695,Ensuring adequate healthcare in COVID and non-COVID areas: An unprecedented challenge,2020-07-24,"Abstract The sequence of a 6.0-kb fragment was compared in the 3′-encoding region of the genome in 27 infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains. All these strains have the same S-3-M-5-N gene order, as is the case for other IBVs. However, the sizes of the corresponding open reading frames (ORFs) of some genes varied among the virus strains. Phylogenetic analysis and sequence alignments demonstrated that recombination events had occurred in the origin and evolution of the strains CK/CH/LSD/03I and CK/CH/LLN/98I and the possible recombinant junction sites might be located at the 3c and M genes, respectively. The normal product of ORF 3a is 57 amino acids long, whereas a 43-bp deletion at the 3′-end of the CK/CH/LSD/03I 3a gene was detected, resulting in a frameshift event and C-terminally truncated protein with 47 amino acids. Comparison of the growth ability in embryos and replication and pathogenicity in chickens with IBV carrying the normal 3a gene indicated that this deleted sequence in the 3a gene of CK/CH/LSD/03I was not necessary for viral pathogenesis and replication either in vitro or in vivo. Occurrence of a mutation at the corresponding position of the CK/CH/LLN/98I start codon in the 3a gene led to the absence of ORF 3a in this virus, resulting in a novel genomic organization at the 3′-encoding regions: S-3b, 3c-M-5a, 5b-N. Comparison with other viruses carrying the normal 3a gene revealed that CK/CH/LLN/98I had replication and pathogenicity abilities in vivo similar to those of other IBVs; however, its growth ability in embryos was lower, although the relationship between the lower growth ability and the ORF 3a defect requires further confirmation.","Liu, Shengwang; Zhang, Qingxia; Chen, Jianfei; Han, Zongxi; Shao, Yuhao; Kong, Xiangang; Tong, Guangzhi",Gene,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18295413/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S037811190800005X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037811190800005X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gene.2008.01.004,359
608831,The nucleoside antiviral prodrug remdesivir in treating COVID-19 and beyond with interspecies significance,2021-09-07,"Abstract The potential impact of coronavirus in Antarctica through tourism and scientific research as well as the Antarctic Treaty System is reviewed over three time periods. In the short term, to April 2021, Antarctic tourism and field-based research will be severely reduced. The impact on Antarctic governance means that few, if any, international meetings will take place thereby leaving discussions on issues, such as fishing quotas, uncertain. Looking to the medium term, to April 2024, polar tourism is unlikely to have recovered and may face collapse unless alternatives are developed. Scientific research, organised through National Antarctic Programs could be reduced due to the economics of a global recession. Moving to a long-term view of six years or so, in terms of scientific activity, this will be highly dependent on the role and status of science in society following the pandemic and the extent to which science funding gets drawn into the economics of the recession. It is unlikely that cruise tourism will have regained its previous volumes though fishing, especially if food security becomes a major issue, is likely to increase pressure on environmental management mechanisms. Both these aspects will continue to put demands on the Antarctic Treaty System and its ability to respond to a fast changing global situation. In this latter sense, it could provide valuable lessons, and also learn from, for other global agreements such as climate change and biodiversity.","Frame, Bob; Hemmings, Alan D.",Social sciences & humanities open,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2590291120300437; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590291120300437?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssaho.2020.100054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34173494/,359
609112,A Global Scale Estimate of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Cases Using Extreme Value Distributions,2020-04-22,"Background: At the height of the first wave of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic, ESMO mobilized to accelerate research for the understanding of COVID-19 in cancer patients (pts). ESMO CoCARE is an international collaborative registry-based, cohort study, gathering real-world data and information from healthcare professionals about the natural history, treatment and outcomes of COVID-19 in cancer pts. Methods: ESMO CoCARE captures information on pts with any solid or hematologic malignancy (including cancer survivors free of disease for ≥5 years) presenting with a COVID-19 diagnosis in any of the participating centers. Data collected since 06/2020 include demographics, cancer characteristics and status, co-morbidities, COVID-19 clinical features, course, management and outcome. Factors influencing COVID-19 severity (hospitalization +/- ICU support needed) and recovery are investigated using multivariable logistic regression with backward elimination method. The study is ongoing. Results: The current analysis includes 1551 registered pts (19 countries;87% pts from 23 European centers, 7% and 6% pts from 5 Northern African and 7 Asian centers), with COVID-19 diagnosis as of 11/03/2021. Median age was 64 years, with the majority female (52%), cancer stage III/IV (58%), and on active cancer treatment (60%). 65% had severe COVID-19 requiring hospitalization, with 11% receiving intensive care. In multivariable analysis, in addition to demographics (male gender, older age, other ethnicity than Caucasian, lower BMI), co-morbidities and symptomatic COVID-19, severe disease was associated to higher ECOG PS (Odds Ratio (OR)2 vs 0=5.9, OR1 vs 0=2.1), hematological malignancies (OR hemvs solid =2.0), and active/progressive cancer status (OR progressivevs no evidence of disease =1.6). 98% of pts with mild disease recovered, as opposed to only 70% of those with severe disease. Cancer stage was an additional prognostic factor for recovery (ORI/II vs IV =3.4). Conclusions: Demographic characteristics, type and status of cancer, and symptomatology of COVID-19 increase the probability of severe disease, while advanced cancer stage is also associated with the risk of death.

609308,Mind your Language: Discursive Practices Produce Unequal Power and Control Over Infectious Disease: A Critical Discourse Analysis,2020-03-16,"Since epidemiological arguments favouring self-isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic are widely recommended, the consequences of social isolation/loneliness of older people considered to be at higher risk for severe illness are neglected. We identified and described medical, social, psychological, and religious issues, indirectly generated by the COVID-19 lockdown. Mortality induced by SARS-CoV-2 and death from other “neglected” issues were put in balance. Arguments for strict lockdown from most European countries are compared with a relaxed approach, as has been applied in Sweden. Social isolation affects disproportionally the elderly, transforming it into a public health concern. One witnesses openly ageist discourse, while painful decisions to prioritising ventilation for younger patients deepens the sense of hopelessness. Fear has led to anxiety disorders and depression. Various religious practices provide resources for coping with isolation/overcoming loneliness. Higher levels of mortality/morbidity due to “COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19” polarisation oblige the healthcare community to find ways to provide proper care for its elders.","Burlacu, Alexandru; Mavrichi, Ionut; Crisan-Dabija, Radu; Jugrin, Daniel; Buju, Smaranda; Artene, Bogdan; Covic, Adrian",Arch Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33747263/; https://doi.org/10.5114/aoms.2020.95955,359
609383,In-silico modeling of COVID-19 ARDS: pathophysiological insights and potential management implications,2020-07-22,"COVID-19 is caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (Cov)-2, an enveloped virus with a positive-polarity, single-stranded RNA genome. The initial outbreak of the pandemic began in December 2019, and it is affecting the human health of the global community. In common with previous pandemics (Influenza H1N1 and SARS-CoV) and the epidemics of Middle east respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, CoVs target bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells. Virus protein ligands (e.g., haemagglutinin or trimeric spike glycoprotein for Influenza and CoV, respectively) interact with cellular receptors, such as (depending on the virus) either sialic acids, Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), or angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Host proteases, e.g., cathepsins, furin, or members of the type II transmembrane serine proteases (TTSP) family, such as Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), are involved in virus entry by proteolytically activating virus ligands. Also involved are Toll Like Receptor (TLR) family members, which upregulate anti-viral and pro-inflammatory mediators [interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 and type I and type III Interferons among others], through the activation of Nuclear Factor (NF)-kB. When these events (virus cellular entry and innate immune responses) are uncontrolled, a deleterious systemic response is sometimes encountered in infected patients, leading to the well-described “cytokine storm” and an ensuing multiple organ failure promoted by a downregulation of dendritic cell, macrophage, and T-cell function. We aim to describe how the lung and systemic host innate immune responses affect survival either positively, through downregulating initial viral load, or negatively, by triggering uncontrolled inflammation. An emphasis will be put on host cellular signaling pathways and proteases involved with a view on tackling these therapeutically.","Sallenave, Jean-Michel; Guillot, Loïc",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32574272/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01229,359

However, the pandemic also affects international trade through reductions in both supply and demand. In this Viewpoint we describe the many implications for health and propose ways to mitigate them. Problems include reduced access to medical supplies (in particular, personal protective equipment and tests), budgetary shortfalls as a result of reduced tariffs and taxes, and a general decline in economic activity—leading, in many cases, to recessions, threats to social safety nets, and to increased precariousness of income, employment, and food security. However, in exceptional cases, the pandemic has also brought some transient benefits, including to the environment. Looking ahead, there will be great pressure to further liberalise rules on trade to encourage economic recovery, but it is essential that trade policy be informed by its many consequences for health to ensure that the benefits are maximised and threats are minimised through active identification and mitigation.","Barlow, Pepita; van Schalkwyk, May CI; McKee, Martin; Labonté, Ron; Stuckler, David",Lancet Planet Health,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2542519620302916; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33581061/; https://doi.org/10.1016/s2542-5196(20)30291-6; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2542519620302916,359

Prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased among adults, adolescents and older children in recent decades. Among countries with the highest prevalence there are signs that the increase is slowing down or even that prevalence is declining. There has been no increase in the prevalence rate in younger children, although the absolute number of children under five years affected by overweight has increased. This review summarizes prevalence data and examines current implementation of regulatory, fiscal and voluntary measures to promote healthy diet across the Region. The last decade has seen a step up in such action. Ten of the Region’s countries have policies relating to trans-fatty acids and they are increasingly implementing specific regulatory measures. Thirteen countries had fully or partially implemented national salt reduction policies by 2019. Only four countries had adopted policies relating to aspects of marketing food to children by 2019, and concrete action in this area is still lacking. Eight countries have introduced taxes—sometimes at a rate of 50%—on carbonated or sugar-sweetened beverages. In order to meet the agreed global and regional goals relating to nutrition and diet-related NCDs, countries will need to build on this progress and scale up action across the Region while intensifying efforts in areas where concrete action is lacking.","Al-Jawaldeh, Ayoub; Hammerich, Asmus; Doggui, Radhouene; Engesveen, Kaia; Lang, Krista; McColl, Karen",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12123700; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33266028/,359

Thus, the urgent need of the hour is to understand and identify the operational issues and challenges encountered in the sample collection process and also at the testing labs in order to respond at the earliest. This early and effective response will help not only to address the identified issues in the whole chain of sample collecting to test result communication but also it will help to improve the functioning of the entire system involved in this process. OBJECTIVES: The present study was undertaken to identify the issues faced during various steps involved in laboratory testing as part of the COVID-19 control activities in selected remote districts of North East and East India. Further, perceived adequacy of human resources, equipment, diagnostic kits, and other essential consumables including PPEs vis-a-vis the load of samples received from the catchment areas of the testing laboratories were also explored. METHODS: The study was a qualitative research using in-depth interview method to collect and collate the data from the chain of personnel involved in sample collection, storage, transportation, and testing by recorded telephonic interview by state-level collaborators as per the study protocol. The respondents were recruited from randomly selected sites of remote districts for sample collection, storage, transportation, and dedicated testing labs in six states of North East and Eastern India. The study findings were analyzed by two-dimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis to get the collective picture involving transcription, preliminary data scrutiny, content analysis, and interpretation of the verbal IDI; classified and summarized by triangulation; free listing and pile sorting of suggestions. RESULTS: The entire laboratory testing related human resources has been working on war-footing round-the-clock to fulfil the expectation of the stakeholders and maintaining high quality despite the ever-increasing load of sample testing in both the public and private sectors. The findings indicated that the healthcare workers from all levels of laboratory diagnosis have taken it as a challenge to control the pandemic even with limitations of logistics to capacity building. Positive suggestions to improve laboratory services were to increase human resources, infrastructure, IT with the robust mechanism of monitoring and supervision.

A new consideration for evaluating and controlling the COVID-19 outbreak will be constructed based on the SEIQR Pandemic Model. In this paper, the real data of COVID-19 spread in Saudi Arabia has been used for the mathematical model and dynamic analyses. Including the new reproductive number and detailed stability analysis, the dynamics of the proposed SEIQR model have been applied. The local sensitivity of the reproduction number has been analyzed. The domain of solution and equilibrium based on the SEIQR model have been proved using a Jacobian linearization process. The state of equilibrium and its significance have been proved, and a study of the integrity of the disease-free equilibrium has been carried out. The Lyapunov stability theorem demonstrated the global stability of the current model equilibrium. The SEIQR model has been numerically validated and projected by contrasting the results from the SEIQR model with the actual COVID-19 spread data in Saudi Arabia.

612845,The effects of a celebrity suicide on suicide rates in Hong Kong,2006-05-11,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening monogenic disease caused by mutations in the gene encoding the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, an anion channel that transports chloride and bicarbonate across epithelia. Despite clinical progress in delaying disease progression with symptomatic therapies, these individuals still develop various chronic complications in lungs and other organs, which significantly restricts their life expectancy and quality of life. The development of high-throughput assays to screen drug-like compound libraries have enabled the discovery of highly effective CFTR modulator therapies. These novel therapies target the primary defect underlying CF and are now approved for clinical use for individuals with specific CF genotypes. However, the clinically approved modulators only partially reverse CFTR dysfunction and there is still a considerable number of individuals with CF carrying rare CFTR mutations who remain without any effective CFTR modulator therapy. Accordingly, additional efforts have been pursued to identify novel and more potent CFTR modulators that may benefit a larger CF population. The use of ex vivo individual-derived specimens has also become a powerful tool to evaluate novel drugs and predict their effectiveness in a personalized medicine approach. In addition to CFTR modulators, pro-drugs aiming at modulating alternative ion channels/transporters are under development to compensate for the lack of CFTR function. These therapies may restore normal mucociliary clearance through a mutation-agnostic approach (ie, independent of CFTR mutation) and include inhibitors of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), modulators of the calcium-activated channel transmembrane 16A (TMEM16, or anoctamin 1) or of the solute carrier family 26A member 9 (SLC26A9), and anionophores. The present review focuses on recent progress and challenges for the development of ion channel/transporter-modulating drugs for the treatment of CF.","Pinto, Madalena C; Silva, Iris A L; Figueira, Miriam F; Amaral, Margarida D; Lopes-Pacheco, Miquéias",J Exp Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.2147/jep.s255377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34326672/,359

METHODS: Data were collected via a telephone survey using a standardized script. Between March 1, 2020 and June 17, 2020, 28,903 people were tested at 4 Connecticut drive‐through testing centers. Individuals who tested positive between March 16 and April 21, 2020 were randomly contacted. Of those individuals, 100 people agreed to complete the survey. Bivariate analysis and logistic regression were performed. RESULTS: HCWs comprised 46% of the 100 survey respondents during the study period. Similarly, HCWs comprised 42.1% of all individuals who tested positive and listed an employer between March 1 and June 17, 2020. HCWs reported a longer duration of symptoms (17.39 vs 13.44 days) and were more likely to report work as their route of exposure (80.4% vs 27.8%) than non‐HCWs. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs may face a disproportionate risk of contracting COVID‐19 and self‐report a longer duration of symptoms than the general public. The data suggest a need for an increased recovery time away from work than is currently recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as an increase in infection precautions for HCWs.","Smith, Aaron A.; Akerson, Joie; Danahey, James; Dinh, Tam N.M.; Porter, Paul S.",J Am Coll Emerg Physicians Open,https://doi.org/10.1002/emp2.12286; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33230507/,359
613325,Prediction of COVID-19 Mortality to Support Patient Prognosis and Triage and Limits of Current Open-Source Data,2021-03-24,"Background Covid-status certification (certificates for those who test negative for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, test positive for antibodies, or who have been vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2) has been proposed to enable safer access to a range of activities. Realising these benefits will depend in part upon the behavioural and social impacts of certification. The aim of this rapid review was to describe public attitudes towards certification, and its possible impact on uptake of testing and vaccination, protective behaviours, and crime. Method A search was undertaken in peer-reviewed databases, pre-print databases, and the grey literature, from 2000 to December 2020. Studies were included if they measured attitudes towards or behavioural consequences of health certificates based on one of three indices of Covid-19 status: test-negative result for current infectiousness, test-positive for antibodies conferring natural immunity, or vaccination(s) conferring immunity. Results Thirty-three papers met the inclusion criteria, only three of which were rated as low risk of bias. Public attitudes were generally favourable towards the use of immunity certificates for international travel, but unfavourable towards their use for access to work and other activities. A significant minority was strongly opposed to the use of certificates of immunity for any purpose. The limited evidence suggested that intention to get vaccinated varied with the activity enabled by certification or vaccination (e.g., international travel). Where vaccination is seen as compulsory this could lead to unwillingness to accept a subsequent vaccination. There was some evidence that restricting access to settings and activities to those with antibody test certificates may lead to deliberate exposure to infection in a minority. Behaviours that reduce transmission may decrease upon health certificates based on any of the three indices of Covid-19 status, including physical distancing and handwashing. Conclusions The limited evidence suggests that health certification in relation to COVID-19 (outside of the context of international travel) has the potential for harm as well as benefit. Realising the benefits while minimising the harms will require real-time evaluations allowing modifications to maximise the potential contribution of certification to enable safer access to a range of activities.","Drury, J.; Mao, G.; John, A.; Kamal, A.; Rubin, J.; Stott, C.; Vandrevala, T.; Marteau, T.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.04.07.21255072v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.07.21255072,359
613431,"Factors Associated with Timely Test Seeking, Test Turnaround, and Public Reporting of COVID-19: a retrospective analysis in Ontario, Canada",2021-02-23,"Interferon lambdas (IFN-λs; IFNL1-4) modulate immunity in the context of infections and autoimmune diseases, through a network of induced genes. IFN-λs act by binding to the heterodimeric IFN-λ receptor (IFNLR), activating a STAT phosphorylation-dependent signaling cascade. Thereby hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes are induced, which modulate various immune functions via complex forward and feedback loops. When compared to the well-characterized IFN-α signaling cascade, three important differences have been discovered. First, the IFNLR is not ubiquitously expressed: in particular, immune cells show significant variation in the expression levels of and susceptibilities to IFN-λs. Second, the binding affinities of individual IFN-λs to the IFNLR varies greatly and are generally lower compared to the binding affinities of IFN-α to its receptor. Finally, genetic variation in the form of a series of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) linked to genes involved in the IFN-λ signaling cascade has been described and associated with the clinical course and treatment outcomes of hepatitis B and C virus infection. The clinical impact of IFN-λ signaling and the SNP variations may, however, reach far beyond viral hepatitis. Recent publications show important roles for IFN-λs in a broad range of viral infections such as human T-cell leukemia type-1 virus, rotaviruses, and influenza virus. IFN-λ also potentially modulates the course of bacterial colonization and infections as shown for Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Although the immunological processes involved in controlling viral and bacterial infections are distinct, IFN-λs may interfere at various levels: as an innate immune cytokine with direct antiviral effects; or as a modulator of IFN-α-induced signaling via the suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 and the ubiquitin-specific peptidase 18 inhibitory feedback loops. In addition, the modulation of adaptive immune functions via macrophage and dendritic cell polarization, and subsequent priming, activation, and proliferation of pathogen-specific T- and B-cells may also be important elements associated with infectious disease outcomes. This review summarizes the emerging details of the IFN-λ immunobiology in the context of the host immune response and viral and bacterial infections.","Syedbasha, Mohammedyaseen; Egli, Adrian",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2017.00119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28293236/,359
613582,A globally available COVID-19 - Template for clinical imaging studies,2020-04-07,"BACKGROUND: CoVid-19 can be a life-threatening lung disease or a trivial upper respiratory infection depending on whether the alveoli are involved. Emergency department (ED) screening in symptomatic patients with normal vital signs is frequently limited to oro-nasopharyngeal swabs. We tested the null hypothesis that patients being screened for CoVid-19 in the ED with normal vital signs and without hypoxia would have a point-of-care lung ultrasound (LUS) consistent with CoVid-19 less than 2% of the time. METHODS: SUBJECTS: Subjects were identified from ED ultrasound logs. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Age 14 years or older with symptoms prompting ED screening for CoVid-19. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Known congestive heart failure or other chronic lung condition likely to cause excessive B lines on LUS. INTERVENTION: Structured blinded ultrasound review and chart review ANALYSIS: We used a two-sided exact hypothesis test for binomial random variables. We also measured LUS diagnostic performance using computed tomography as the gold standard. RESULTS: We reviewed 77 charts; 49 met inclusion criteria. Vital signs were normal in 30/49 patients; 10 (33%) of these patients had LUS consistent with CoVid-19. We rejected the null hypothesis (p-value <0.001). The treating physicians’ interpretation of their own point of care lung ultrasounds had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 75%, 100%) and specificity of 80% (95% CI 68%, 89%). CONCLUSION: LUS has a meaningful detection rate for CoVid-19 in symptomatic ED patients with normal vital signs.

A serological survey was done at some of these locations to assess the COVID-19 exposure prevalence in this group. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional seroprevalence study at food distribution sites, emergency shelters, and workers' residences that were provided medical services by Médecins Sans Frontières in Paris and Seine-Saint-Denis in the Ile-de-France region. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody seropositivity was detected by Luciferase-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and Pseudo Neutralization Test. Sociodemographic and exposure related information was collected via a verbal questionnaire to analyse risk factors and associations with various COVID-19 symptoms. FINDINGS: Between June 23 and July 2, 2020, 426 (52%) of 818 individuals recruited tested positive in 14 sites. Seroprevalence varied significantly by type of recruitment site (χ(2) p<0·0001), being highest among those living in workers' residences (88·7%, 95% CI 81·8–93·2), followed by emergency shelters (50·5%, 46·3–54·7), and food distribution sites (27·8%, 20·8–35·7). More than two thirds of COVID-19 seropositive individuals (68%, 95% CI 64·2–72·2; 291 of 426) did not report any symptoms during the recall period. COVID-19 seropositivity was strongly associated with overcrowding (medium density: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2·7, 95% CI 1·5–5·1, p=0·0020; high density: aOR 3·4, 1·7–6·9, p<0·0001). INTERPRETATION: These results show high exposure to SARS-CoV-2 with important variations between those at different study sites. Living in crowded conditions was the strongest factor associated with exposure level.

To identify the CAP-associated genetic risk loci, we performed a meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed CAP (3310 individuals) with 2655 healthy controls. The findings revealed CYP1A1 variants (rs2606345, rs4646903, rs1048943) associated with pneumonia. We observed rs2606345 [G vs T; OR=1.49(1.29-1.69); p=0.0001; I2= 15.5%], and rs1048943 [T vs G; OR= 1.31(0.90-1.71); p=0.002; I2=19.3%] as risk markers and rs4646903 [T vs C; OR= 0.79(0.62-0.96); p=0.03; I2=0%] as a protective marker for susceptibility to CAP, when compared with healthy controls. Our meta-analysis showed the presence of CYP1A1 SNP alleles contributing significant risk toward pneumonia susceptibility. Interestingly, we observed a striking difference of allele frequency for rs2606345 (CYP1A1) among Europeans, Africans and Asians which may provide a possible link for observed variations in death due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral pneumonia. We report, for the first time, a significant positive correlation for the risk allele (T or A) of rs2606345, with a higher COVID-19 mortality rate worldwide and within a genetically heterogeneous nation like India. Mechanistically, the risk allele 'A' (rs2606345) is associated with lower expression of CYP1A1 and presumably leads to reduced capacity for xenobiotic detoxification. We note that ambient air pollution, a powerful inducer of CYP1A1 gene expression, is globally associated with lower, not higher mortality, as would normally be predicted. In conclusion, we find that CYP1A1 alleles are associated with CAP mortality, presumably via altered xenobiotic metabolism. We speculate that gene-environment interactions governing CYP1A1 expression may influence COVID-19 mortality.","Guin, D.; Yadav, S.; Singh, P.; Thakran, S.; Kukal, S.; Kanojia, N.; Paul, P.

The impact of these lockdowns on mental health is inadequately understood. On the one hand such drastic changes in daily routines could be detrimental to mental health. On the other hand, it might not be experienced negatively, especially because the entire population was affected. METHODS: The aim of this study was to determine mental health outcomes during pandemic induced lockdowns and to examine known predictors of mental health outcomes. We therefore surveyed n = 9,565 people from 78 countries and 18 languages. Outcomes assessed were stress, depression, affect, and wellbeing. Predictors included country, sociodemographic factors, lockdown characteristics, social factors, and psychological factors. RESULTS: Results indicated that on average about 10% of the sample was languishing from low levels of mental health and about 50% had only moderate mental health. Importantly, three consistent predictors of mental health emerged: social support, education level, and psychologically flexible (vs. rigid) responding. Poorer outcomes were most strongly predicted by a worsening of finances and not having access to basic supplies. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that on whole, respondents were moderately mentally healthy at the time of a population-wide lockdown. The highest level of mental health difficulties were found in approximately 10% of the population. Findings suggest that public health initiatives should target people without social support and those whose finances worsen as a result of the lockdown.

616156,The COVID-19 pandemic: Challenges to prevent suicide in megacities,2020-10-11,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) represent a serious global health burden. To date, few reports have addressed the prevalence of respiratory viruses (RVs) in adults with ARTIs attending an emergency department (ED). Therefore, the potential impact of respiratory virus infections on such patients remains unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To determine the epidemiological and clinical profiles of common and recently discovered respiratory viruses in adults with ARTIs attending an ED in Beijing, a 1-year consecutive study was conducted from May, 2010, to April, 2011. Nose and throat swab samples from 416 ARTI patients were checked for 13 respiratory viruses using multiple reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction(RT-PCR) assays for common respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses (Flu) A, B, and adenoviruses (ADVs), picornaviruses (PICs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1–3, combined with real-time RT-PCR for human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human coronaviruses (HCoVs, -OC43, -229E, -NL63, and -HKU1). Viral pathogens were detected in 52.88% (220/416) of patient samples, and 7.21% (30/416) of patients tested positive for more than one virus. PICs (17.79%) were the dominant agents detected, followed by FluA (16.11%), HCoVs (11.78%), and ADV (11.30%). HMPV, PIVs, and FluB were also detected (<3%), but not RSV. The total prevalence and the dominant virus infections detected differed significantly between ours and a previous report. Co-infection rates were high for HCoV-229E (12/39, 30.76%), PIC (22/74, 29.73%), ADV (12/47, 25.53%) and FluA (15/67, 22.39%). Different patterns of clinical symptoms were associated with different respiratory viruses. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of RV involvement in adults with ARTIs attending an ED in China differs from that previously reported. The high prevalence of viruses (PIC, FluA, HCoVs and ADV) reported here strongly highlight the need for the development of safe and effective therapeutic approaches for these viruses.","Yu, Xiaoyan; Lu, Roujian; Wang, Zhong; Zhu, Na; Wang, Wen; Julian, Druce; Chris, Birch; Lv, Jianxin; Tan, Wenjie",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22389685/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0032174,359

There is no licensed vaccine or antiviral treatment against ZIKV infection. The effort to understand the complex interactions of ZIKV with cellular networks contributes to the identification of novel host-directed antiviral (HDA) candidates. Among the cellular pathways involved in infection, lipid metabolism gains attention. In ZIKV-infected cells lipid metabolism attributed to intracellular membrane remodeling, virion morphogenesis, autophagy modulation, innate immunity and inflammation. The key roles played by the cellular structures associated with lipid metabolism, such as peroxisomes and lipid droplets, are starting to be deciphered. Consequently, there is a wide variety of lipid-related antiviral strategies that are currently under consideration, which include an inhibition of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP), the activation of adenosine-monophosphate activated kinase (AMPK), an inhibition of acetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC), interference with sphingolipid metabolism, blockage of intracellular cholesterol trafficking, or a treatment with cholesterol derivatives. Remarkably, most of the HDAs identified in these studies are also effective against flaviviruses other than ZIKV (West Nile virus and dengue virus), supporting their broad-spectrum effect. Considering that lipid metabolism is one of the main cellular pathways suitable for pharmacological intervention, the idea of repositioning drugs targeting lipid metabolism as antiviral candidates is gaining force.","Martín-Acebes, Miguel A.; Jiménez de Oya, Nereida; Saiz, Juan-Carlos",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/ph12020097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31234348/,359

A better understanding on how to measure the true age of an individual or biological aging is an essential step that may lead to the definition of putative markers capable of predicting healthy aging. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of the INStitute for Prevention healthy aging and medicine Rejuvenative (INSPIRE) Platform initiative is to build a program for Geroscience and healthy aging research going from animal models to humans and the health care system. The specific aim of the INSPIRE human translational cohort (INSPIRE-T cohort) is to gather clinical, digital and imaging data, and perform relevant and extensive biobanking to allow basic and translational research on humans. METHODS: The INSPIRE-T cohort consists in a population study comprising 1000 individuals in Toulouse and surrounding areas (France) of different ages (20 years or over — no upper limit for age) and functional capacity levels (from robustness to frailty, and even dependency) with follow-up over 10 years. Diversified data are collected annually in research facilities or at home according to standardized procedures. Between two annual visits, IC domains are monitored every 4-month by using the ICOPE Monitor app developed in collaboration with WHO. Once IC decline is confirmed, participants will have a clinical assessment and blood sampling to investigate markers of aging at the time IC declines are detected. Biospecimens include blood, urine, saliva, and dental plaque that are collected from all subjects at baseline and then, annually. Nasopharyngeal swabs and cutaneous surface samples are collected in a large subgroup of subjects every two years. Feces, hair bulb and skin biopsy are collected optionally at the baseline visit and will be performed again during the longitudinal follow up. EXPECTED RESULTS: Recruitment started on October 2019 and is expected to last for two years. Bio-resources collected and explored in the INSPIRE-T cohort will be available for academic and industry partners aiming to identify robust (set of) markers of aging, age-related diseases and IC evolution that could be pharmacologically or non-pharmacologically targetable.

617422,The effect of BCG vaccination on COVID-19 examined by a statistical approach: no positive results from the Diamond Princess and cross-national differences previously reported by world-wide comparisons are flawed in several ways,2020-04-22,"The triterpene oil squalene is an essential component of nanoemulsion vaccine adjuvants. It is most notably in the MF59 adjuvant, a component in some seasonal influenza vaccines, in stockpiled, emulsion-based adjuvanted pandemic influenza vaccines, and with demonstrated efficacy for vaccines to other pandemic viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2. Squalene has historically been harvested from shark liver oil, which is undesirable for a variety of reasons. In this study, we have demonstrated the use of a Synthetic Biology (yeast) production platform to generate squalene and novel triterpene oils, all of which are equally as efficacious as vaccine adjuvants based on physiochemical properties and immunomodulating activities in a mouse model. These Synthetic Biology adjuvants also elicited similar IgG1, IgG2a, and total IgG levels compared to marine and commercial controls when formulated with common quadrivalent influenza antigens. Injection site morphology and serum cytokine levels did not suggest any reactogenic effects of the yeast-derived squalene or novel triterpenes, suggesting their safety in adjuvant formulations. These results support the advantages of yeast produced triterpene oils to include completely controlled growth conditions, just-in-time and scalable production, and the capacity to produce novel triterpenes beyond squalene.","Tateno, Mizuki; Stone, Barbara J.; Srodulski, Sarah J.; Reedy, Stephanie; Gawriluk, Thomas R.; Chambers, Thomas M.; Woodward, Jerold; Chappell, Joe; Kempinski, Chase F.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33051497/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-73868-6,359
617540,IMMUNOLOGICAL INSIGHTS INTO THE THERAPEUTIC ROLES OF CD24Fc AGAINST SEVERE COVID-19,2021-08-23,"This fictionalized script (fictional dialogue between Coronavirus and the Philosopher) traces the contours of the conversation that seeks to fathom the crisis unleashed by the outbreak and global spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19 pandemic) and the ensuing anxieties created in our current social living. The scenario of deepened isolation of the self from the other (social distancing and ‘stay-at-home’ or various lockdowns) is considered, and it is proposed (by the philosopher, I presume) that isolation, while an unavoidable requirement, does not mean it is some mental lassitude but rather may be seen as an enthusiastic concern toward recovering physical and mental wellbeing of the larger communities concerned to control the possible avenues of transmission of the contagion. The conversation meanders around the issue of quarantine, its attraction or otherwise, and who benefits from this restriction, its effects on one’s mental constitution, etc. Philosophers have been known to isolate themselves in other contexts and situations (Yajñvalkya and the Buddha withdrawing to the forest; the Jain mendicants crossing “the ford”; the Stoics withdrawing from society, Nietzsche’s retreating regularly to the sanatorium; Heidegger to the Black Forrest; Kant’s unsocial sociability and Wittgenstein living lonesome lives, etc.) give us a taste of what is to come in the dialogue to resist the calamity of the coronavirus and its grim effects that engulf the entire humanity.","Chakraborty, Sanjit",SOPHIA,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11841-021-00859-z,359

618120,Altitude as a protective factor from COVID-19,2020-08-04,"Vitamin D, best known for its role in skeletal health, has emerged as a key regulator of innate immune responses to microbial threat. In immune cells such as macrophages, expression of CYP27B1, the 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1α-hydroxylase, is induced by immune-specific inputs, leading to local production of hormonal 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25D) at sites of infection, which in turn directly induces the expression of genes encoding antimicrobial peptides. Vitamin D signaling is active upstream and downstream of pattern recognition receptors, which promote front-line innate immune responses. Moreover, 1,25D stimulates autophagy, which has emerged as a mechanism critical for control of intracellular pathogens such as M. tuberculosis. Strong laboratory and epidemiological evidence links vitamin D deficiency to increased rates of conditions such as dental caries, as well as inflammatory bowel diseases arising from dysregulation of innate immune handling intestinal flora. 1,25D is also active in signaling cascades that promote antiviral innate immunity; 1,25D-induced expression of the antimicrobial peptide CAMP/LL37, originally characterized for its antibacterial properties, is a key component of antiviral responses. Poor vitamin D status is associated with greater susceptibility to viral infections, including those of the respiratory tract. Although the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic has been alleviated in some areas by the arrival of vaccines, it remains important to identify therapeutic interventions that reduce disease severity and mortality, and accelerate recovery. This review outlines of our current knowledge of the mechanisms of action of vitamin D signaling in the innate immune system. It also provides an assessment of the therapeutic potential of vitamin D supplementation in infectious diseases, including an up-to-date analysis of the putative benefits of vitamin D supplementation in the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.","Ismailova, Aiten; White, John H.",Rev Endocr Metab Disord,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34322844/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11154-021-09679-5,359

Purposes: The purpose of this study was to assess physicians’ sentiments regarding telemedicine and its use in orthopedic practices. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study of attending orthopedic physicians, the majority of whom integrated telemedicine into their practices from March to October 2020. A survey was sent to 517 physicians who had registered for an orthopedics conference. The survey included questions pertaining to various factors regarding telemedicine and each physician’s practice. Results: Of the 517 physicians who received the survey, 328 responded, for a 63.4% response rate. Of the 328 respondents, 84.1% did not use telemedicine in their practice prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Even during the pandemic, the physicians most commonly responded that less than 5% of their practice was conducted by telemedicine (n = 103, 31.4%). The second most common response was that more than 20% of visits were done via telemedicine (n = 72, 22.0%); 43.0% of physicians noted that they would not use telemedicine technology in their practice after the pandemic, but 59.1% of physicians would be willing to do annual visits by telemedicine. Ability to examine the patient (2.0 ± 1.0) was rated worse, overall, than either the experience using the technology (3.2 ± 1.0) or the capacity to communicate with the patient (3.6 ± 1.0). Conclusions: Our survey of orthopedic surgeons demonstrates that while the use of telemedicine technology was minimal prior to the pandemic, its use was widely adopted during the pandemic. Nearly half of physicians said that they will continue to use telemedicine.","Kolin, David A.; Carroll, Kaitlin M.; Plancher, Kevin; Cushner, Fred",HSS J,https://doi.org/10.1177/1556331620979984; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33967639/,359
618860,Perioperative preparation in thoracic day surgery: Battle against COVID‐19,2020-06-17,"OBJECTIVES: To explore and compare the perspectives of junior doctors in Brazil and Ireland regarding transition and professional socialisation during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the purpose of identifying better ways to support doctors as they assume their new professional role. DESIGN: 27 semistructured interviews. Transcripts were analysed using qualitative thematic analysis. Cruess’ framework of professional socialisation in medicine supported the interpretation of these data. SETTING: Public health hospitals across four Brazilian states (Santa Catarina, São Paulo, Ceará, Paraíba) and County Cork in the South of Ireland. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-seven male and female medical junior doctors who had graduated between November 2019 and April 2020. RESULTS: Fourteen Brazilian and 13 Irish junior doctors were interviewed for this study. Entry to clinical practice during the pandemic had a significant impact on factors influencing the professional socialisation of junior doctors. This impact was reflected across the following six thematic areas: lack of preparedness; disrupted trajectory of role adaptation; fewer opportunities for experiential learning; solidarity and isolation; altered interactions with patients; challenges to health and well-being. CONCLUSIONS: Transition to clinical practice is an important stage in junior doctors’ professional socialisation and identity formation. The COVID-19 pandemic created the opportunity for medical graduates to enter the workforce earlier than usual. Entering the workforce during this period created a lack of confidence among junior doctors concerning the boundaries of their new role and responsibilities, while simultaneously disrupting their social integration. Priorities to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 and future pandemics on this transition are presented.","Montagna, Erik; Donohoe, Jessica; Zaia, Victor; Duggan, Eileen; O'Leary, Paula; Waddington, John; O'Tuathaigh, Colm",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34551956/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-053423,359

Now, the debates remain on whether, vertical transmission of Severe Respiratory Syndrome Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and antibodies against the virus do exist. We therefore, conducted a systematic review to determine the immunoglobulin G and M (IgG/IgM) levels among infants born to mothers with COVID-19. Methods The systematic search was done using PubMed/MEDLINE and Google Scholar database. The research included studies on IgG/ IgM against SARS-CoV-2 among infants born to mother with COVID-19 published in English from December 1, 2019 onwards. Data were extracted by two independent authors in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA-P) guidelines. We synthesized a narrative from eligible studies and performed two tailed non-parametric Mann-Whitney test to determine and compare the median IgG/IgM levels. Results In total, 486 abstracts were screened and 63 full-text articles were assessed. Of 63 articles, 6 met the inclusion criteria for qualitative analysis. Two articles were included in quantitative analysis of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG/ IgM levels. The median antibody levels was 75.49AU/mL (range: 7.25AU/mL- 140.32AU/mL ) and for 3.79AU/mL (range: 0.16AU/mL-45.83AU/mL) (P = 0.0041) for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM, respectively. Conclusion There were high levels of IgG but low IgM against SARS-CoV-2 (using <10 AU/mL as a reference range) among COVID-19 virus exposed but negative newborns. This review suggest a possible natural passive immunity (IgG/ IgM) against COVID-19 virus.","Bwire, G. M.; Njiro, B.

619901,A Postcard From Italy: Challenges and Psychosocial Resources of Partners Living With and Without a Chronic Disease During COVID-19 Epidemic,2020-12-11,"On 21 February 2020, a violent COVID-19 outbreak, which was initially concentrated in Lombardy before infecting some surrounding regions exploded in Italy. Shortly after, on 9 March, the Italian Government imposed severe restrictions on its citizens, including a ban on traveling to other parts of the country. No travel, no virus spread. Many regions, such as those in southern Italy, were spared. Then, in June 2020, under pressure for the economy to reopen, many lockdown measures were relaxed, including the ban on interregional travel. As a result, the virus traveled for hundreds of kilometers, from north to south, with the effect that areas without infections, receiving visitors from infected areas, became infected. This resulted in a sharp increase in the number of infected people; i.e., the daily count of new positive cases, when comparing measurements from the beginning of July to those from at the middle of September, rose significantly in almost all the Italian regions. Upon confirmation of the effect of Italian domestic tourism on the virus spread, three computational models of increasing complexity (linear, negative binomial regression, and cognitive) have been compared in this study, with the aim of identifying the one that better correlates the relationship between Italian tourist flows during the summer of 2020 and the resurgence of COVID-19 cases across the country. Results show that the cognitive model has more potential than the others, yet has relevant limitations. The models should be considered as a relevant starting point for the study of this phenomenon, even if there is still room to further develop them up to a point where they become able to capture all the various and complex spread patterns of this disease.","Casini, Luca; Roccetti, Marco",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s20247319; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33352802/,359
619946,Hemoptysis in COVID-19: Pulmonary Emboli Should be Ruled Out,2020-05-26,"In order to design actionable SARS-CoV-2 strategies, we extended the SEIRS model to support stratified isolation levels for healthy <60 and vulnerable individuals. At first, we forced isolation levels to be uniform, showing that daily deaths curves of all metropolitan areas in the analysis can be fitted using homogeneous Ro=3.3. In the process, we established the possibility that an extremely short infectiousness period of 2 days coupled with 5 days exposure may be responsible for the multiple deaths valleys observed during the weeks following lockdowns. Regardless of the infectiousness period, we realized that is possible to infer non-uniform isolation levels for healthy <60 and vulnerable by forcing the model to match the <60 to >60 age serology ratio reported in seroprevalence studies. Since the serology ratio is more robust than absolute values, we argue immunity level estimations made in this way (Madrid 43%; Catalonia 24%; Brussels 73%; and Stockholm 65%) are closer to reality. In locations where we did not find reliable serology, we performed immunity estimations assuming Spain serology ratio (Paris: 24%; London: 34%). We predict that, with the exception of Brussels, no location can return to normal life without having a second wave (albeit in Stockholm a smaller one). For locations far from the herd immunity threshold (HIT) we searched what isolation values allow to return to normal life in 90 days minimizing final deaths, shockingly all found isolations for healthy <60 were negative (i.e. coronavirus parties minimize final deaths). Then, assuming an ideal 1-day long vaccination campaign with a 77% efficacy vaccine, we compared predicted final deaths of those 90-day strategies for all possible vaccination dates with a 180-day long vaccine waiting strategy that imposes 0.40 mandatory isolation to healthy <60 and results in 0.65 isolation to vulnerable. We found that 180-day of mandatory isolations to healthy <60 (i.e. schools and workplaces closed) produces more final deaths if the vaccination date is later than (Madrid: March 7 2021; Catalonia: Dec 26 2020; Paris: Jan 12 2021; London: Jan 25 2021). We conclude that our 2-stratum SEIRS model is suitable to predict SARS-CoV-2 epidemic behavior and can be used to minimize covid-19 disease and isolations related damages.","Djaparidze, L.; Lois, F.

620084,Cognitive and Neuropsychiatric Manifestations of COVID-19 and Effects on Elderly Individuals With Dementia,2020-10-26,"The importance of support to breastfeeding success is well established, as are the difficulties many mothers face in accessing the support they need. With the majority of UK mothers now accessing social media for support, Breastfeeding Support Facebook (BSF) groups have increased exponentially. BSF groups vary in type (local or national/international) and in moderation—overseen by breastfeeding mothers and by midwives or trained lactation specialists. Some groups aimed at supporting mothers in a specific geographical area also have associated face‐to‐face groups, facilitated as either professional or peer support. Little is currently known about these specific local groups, their prevalence, impact or value to mothers. This paper examines mothers' experiences of using local BSF groups and why they value them as part of a larger study exploring the impact of midwife moderation on these groups. An online survey consisting of open and closed questions was completed by 2028 mothers. Findings identified that local BSF groups are widely used and highly valued for their connection with local face‐to‐face services and other mothers. They offer access to expertise and shared experience in a format mothers find convenient and timely, improving confidence and self‐efficacy. Local BSF groups enable the formation of support networks and development of breastfeeding knowledge that mothers credit with increased well‐being, motivation and breastfeeding duration. As such, they have the potential to add value to local face‐to‐face services and improve breastfeeding experiences and knowledge in communities. The findings have important implications to support the development of integrated online interventions to improve public health.","Morse, Holly; Brown, Amy",Matern Child Nutr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34060716/; https://doi.org/10.1111/mcn.13227,359

This study investigated whether multi-domain cognitive training programs, especially robot-assisted training, conducted 12 times, twice a week for 6 weeks can improve cognitive function and depression decline in community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted with 135 volunteers without cognitive impairment aged 60 years old or older. Participants were first randomized into two groups. One group consisted of 90 participants who would receive cognitive training and 45 who would not receive any training (NI). The cognitive training group was randomly divided into two groups, 45 who received traditional cognitive training (TCT) and 45 who received robot-assisted cognitive training (RACT). The training for both groups consisted of a daily 60 min session, twice a week for six weeks. Results: RACT participants had significantly greater post-intervention improvement in cognitive function (t = 4.707, p < 0.001), memory (t = −2.282, p = 0.007), executive function (t = 4.610, p < 0.001), and depression (t = −3.307, p = 0.004).

The binding of azoles to the active site of SDM results in a depletion of ergosterol, the accumulation of toxic intermediates and growth inhibition. The prevalence of azole-resistant strains and fungi is increasing in both agriculture and medicine. This can lead to major yield loss during food production and therapeutic failure in medical settings. Diverse mechanisms are responsible for azole resistance. They include amino acid (AA) substitutions in SDM and overexpression of SDM and/or efflux pumps. This review considers AA affecting the ligand-binding pocket of SDMs with a primary focus on substitutions that affect interactions between the active site and the substrate and inhibitory ligands. Some of these interactions are particularly important for the binding of short-tailed azoles (e.g., voriconazole). We highlight the occurrence throughout the fungal kingdom of some key AA substitutions. Elucidation of the role of these AAs and their substitutions may assist drug design in overcoming some common forms of innate and acquired azole resistance.","Rosam, Katharina; Monk, Brian C.; Lackner, Michaela",J Fungi (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33374996/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jof7010001,359

METHODS: A rural-based cross sectional survey was carried out in Perak state in Peninsular Malaysia in March 2011. The survey recruited a population-representative sample using multistage sampling. Altogether 2379 participants were included in this study. Validated bowel/colorectal cancer awareness measure questionnaire was used to assess the level of colorectal cancer awareness among study population. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was done to identify socio-demographic variance of knowledge score on warning signs and risk factors of colorectal cancer. RESULTS: Among respondents, 38% and 32% had zero knowledge score for warning signs and risk factors respectively. Mean knowledge score for warning signs and risk factors were 2.89 (SD 2.96) and 3.49 (SD 3.17) respectively. There was a significant positive correlation between the knowledge score of warning signs and level of confidence in detecting a warning sign. Socio-demographic characteristics and having cancer in family and friends play important role in level of awareness. CONCLUSIONS: Level of awareness on colorectal cancer warning signs and risk factors in the rural population of Malaysia is very low. Therefore, it warrants an extensive health education campaign on colorectal cancer awareness as it is one of the commonest cancer in Malaysia. Health education campaign is urgently needed because respondents would seek medical attention sooner if they are aware of this problem.","Su, Tin Tin; Goh, Jun Yan; Tan, Jackson; Muhaimah, Abdul Rahim; Pigeneswaren, Yoganathan; Khairun, Nasirin Sallamun; Normazidah, Abdul Wahab; Tharisini, Devi Kunasekaran; Majid, Hazreen Abd",BMC Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23924238/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2407-13-376,359

621027,COVID-19 and thermoregulation-related problems: Practical recommendations,2020-08-06,"BACKGROUND: The fact that medical terms require special expertise and are becoming increasingly complex makes it difficult to employ natural language processing techniques in medical informatics. Several human-validated reference standards for medical terms have been developed to evaluate word embedding models using the semantic similarity and relatedness of medical word pairs. However, there are very few reference standards in non-English languages. In addition, because the existing reference standards were developed a long time ago, there is a need to develop an updated standard to represent recent findings in medical sciences. OBJECTIVE: We propose a new Korean word pair reference set to verify embedding models. METHODS: From January 2010 to December 2020, 518 medical textbooks, 72,844 health information news, and 15,698 medical research articles were collected, and the top 10,000 medical terms were selected to develop medical word pairs. Attending physicians (n=16) participated in the verification of the developed set with 607 word pairs. RESULTS: The proportion of word pairs answered by all participants was 90.8% (551/607) for the similarity task and 86.5% (525/605) for the relatedness task. The similarity and relatedness of the word pair showed a high correlation (ρ=0.70, P<.001). The intraclass correlation coefficients to assess the interrater agreements of the word pair sets were 0.47 on the similarity task and 0.53 on the relatedness task. The final reference standard was 604 word pairs for the similarity task and 599 word pairs for relatedness, excluding word pairs with answers corresponding to outliers and word pairs that were answered by less than 50% of all the respondents. When FastText models were applied to the final reference standard word pair sets, the embedding models learning medical documents had a higher correlation between the calculated cosine similarity scores compared to human-judged similarity and relatedness scores (namu, ρ=0.12 vs with medical text for the similarity task, ρ=0.47; namu, ρ=0.02 vs with medical text for the relatedness task, ρ=0.30). CONCLUSIONS: Korean medical word pair reference standard sets for semantic similarity and relatedness were developed based on medical documents from the past 10 years. It is expected that our word pair reference sets will be actively utilized in the development of medical and multilingual natural language processing technology in the future.","Yum, Yunjin; Lee, Jeong Moon; Jang, Moon Joung; Kim, Yoojoong; Kim, Jong-Ho; Kim, Seongtae; Shin, Unsub; Song, Sanghoun; Joo, Hyung Joon",JMIR Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34185005/; https://doi.org/10.2196/29667,359

To protect healthcare workers from infection during airway management, some expert recommendations and guidelines recommended wearing P2/N95 masks, goggles or glasses, glove, face-shields, and gowns as standard personal protective equipment (PPE). Nevertheless, several simulation studies have suggested that the standard PPE may not fully protect healthcare workers. Dr. Hsien Yung Lai introduced an acrylic box (“aerosol box”) as a part of PPE during airway management. Since then, several companies and healthcare workers have made their own modified devices (“aerosol containment device”), and the use of such a device has spread worldwide, without being formally assessed for its effectiveness, efficacy and safety. Several simulation studies have indicated that “aerosol containment device” would make tracheal intubation more difficult. In addition, the device would prevent the spread of droplets from a patient, but may increase the risk of healthcare workers being exposed to a higher concentration of viral aerosols. Therefore, the current state of knowledge indicates that an “aerosol containment device” without vacuum mechanism has only limited efficacy in protecting healthcare workers from viral transmission.","Saito, Tomoyuki; Asai, Takashi",J Anesth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33226519/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s00540-020-02879-4,359
621441,Retrospective survey from Vascular Access Team Lombardy Net in COVID-19 era,2020,"OBJECTIVES: To estimate the burden and severity of suspected reinfection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: A retrospective cohort of members of Kaiser Permanente Southern California with PCR-positive SARS-CoV-2 infection between 1st March 2020 and 31st October 2020 was followed through electronic health records for subsequent positive SARS-CoV-2 tests (suspected reinfection) ≥90 days after initial infection, through 31st January 2021. Incidence of suspected reinfection was estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. Cox proportional hazards models estimated the association of suspected reinfection with demographic and clinical characteristics, hospitalization, and date of initial infection. RESULTS: The cohort of 75 149 was predominantly Hispanic (49 648/75 149, 66.1%) and included slightly more females than males (39 736, 52.9%), with few immunocompromised patients (953, 1.3%); 315 suspected reinfections were identified, with a cumulative incidence at 270 days of 0.8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7–1.0%). Hospitalization was more common at suspected reinfection (36/315, 11.4%) than initial infection (4094/75 149, 5.4%). Suspected reinfection rates were higher in females (1.0%, CI 0.8–1.2% versus 0.7%, CI 0.5–0.9%, p 0.002) and immunocompromised patients (2.1%, CI 1.0–4.2% versus 0.8%, CI 0.7–1.0%, p 0.004), and lower in children than adults (0.2%, CI 0.1–0.4% versus 0.9%, CI 0.7–1.0%, p 0.023). Patients hospitalized at initial infection were more likely to have suspected reinfection (1.2%, CI 0.6–1.7% versus 0.8%, CI 0.7–1.0%, p 0.030), as were those with initial infections later in 2020 (150-day incidence 0.4%, CI 0.2–0.5% September–October versus 0.2%, CI 0.1–0.3% March–May and 0.3%, CI 0.2–0.3% June–August, p 0.008). In an adjusted Cox proportional hazards model, being female (hazard ratio (HR) 1.44, CI 1.14–1.81), adult (age 18–39, HR 2.71, CI 1.38–5.31, age 40–59 HR 2.22, CI 1.12–4.41, age ≥60 HR 2.52, CI 1.23–5.17 versus <18 years), immunocompromised (HR 2.48, CI 1.31–4.68), hospitalized (HR 1.60, CI 1.07–2.38), and initially infected later in 2020 (HR 2.26, CI 1.38–3.71 September–October versus March–May) were significant independent predictors of suspected reinfection. CONCLUSIONS: Reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 is uncommon, with suspected reinfections more likely in women, adults, immunocompromised subjects, and those previously hospitalized for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19). This suggests a need for continued precautions and vaccination in patients with COVID-19 to prevent reinfection.","Slezak, Jeff; Bruxvoort, Katia; Fischer, Heidi; Broder, Benjamin; Ackerson, Bradley; Tartof, Sara",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2021.07.030; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X21004225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34419576/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X21004225,359

Based on a sample of CEOs of S&P 500 firms, we found that mortality salience was associated with CEOs' increased other-orientation, and this association was more pronounced among those with high prevention focus. Mortality salience also was associated with CEOs' decreased self-orientation, particularly among those with high promotion focus. We also found that CEOs' self-orientation was negatively related to the likelihood of their firms' making community donations.

It plays a central role in determining the composition of the plasma membrane and is thus critical for normal cellular homeostasis. However, defective endosomal recycling has been linked to a wide range of diseases, including cancer and some of the most common neurological disorders. It is also frequently subverted by many diverse human pathogens in order to successfully infect cells. Despite its importance, endosomal recycling remains relatively understudied in comparison to the endocytic and secretory transport pathways. A greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms that support transport through the endosomal recycling pathway will provide deeper insights into the pathophysiology of disease and will likely identify new approaches for their detection and treatment. This review will provide an overview of the normal physiological role of the endosomal recycling pathway, describe the consequences when it malfunctions, and discuss potential strategies for modulating its activity.","O’Sullivan, Mary J.; Lindsay, Andrew J.",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32842549/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21176074,359

Design: Cross-sectional study Setting: Tertiary hospitals in Uusimaa region, Finland Participants: Of 1072 enrolled, 866 HCWs (588 nurses, 170 doctors and 108 laboratory and medical imaging nurses) from the Helsinki University Hospital completed the questionnaire by July 15th, 2020. The average age of participants was 42.4 years and 772 (89.0%) were women. The participants answered a detailed questionnaire of their PPE usage, ability to follow safety restrictions, exposure to COVID-19, the source of potential COVID-19 infection and both mental and physical symptoms during the first wave of COVID-19 in Finland. Main outcome measures: All participants with COVID-19 symptoms were tested with either RT-PCR or antibody tests. The infections were traced and categorised based on the location and source of infection. The possibility to maintain social distance and PPE usage during exposure were analyzed. Results: Of the HCWs that participated, 41 (4.7%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, marking a substantially higher infection rate than that of the general population (0.3%); 22 (53.6%) of infections were confirmed or likely occupational, including 7 (31.8%) from colleagues. Additionally, 5 (26.3%) of other infections were from colleagues outside the working facilities. 14 (63.6%) of occupational infections occurred while using a surgical mask. No occupational infections were found while using an FFP2/3 respirator and aerosol precautions while treating suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients. Conclusions: While treating suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, HCWs should wear an FFP2/3 respirator and recommended PPE. Maintaining safety distances in the workplace and controlling infections between HCWs should be priorities to ensure safe working conditions.","Oksanen, L.-M. A.

623023,Why the lower reported prevalence of asthma in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 validates repurposing EDTA solutions to prevent and manage treat COVID-19 disease,2020-06-26,"ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: H syndrome (HS) is a rare autoinflammatory disease caused by a mutation in the solute carrier family 29, member 3 (SCL29A3) gene. It has a variable clinical presentation and little phenotype-genotype correlation. The pathognomonic sign of HS is cutaneous hyperpigmentation located mainly in the inner thighs and often accompanied by other systemic manifestations. Improvement after tocilizumab treatment has been reported in a few patients with HS. We report the first patient with HS who presented cardiogenic shock, multiorgan infiltration, and digital ischemia. CASE PRESENTATION: 8-year-old boy born to consanguineous parents of Moroccan origin who was admitted to the intensive care unit during the Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic with tachypnoea, tachycardia, and oliguria. Echocardiography showed dilated cardiomyopathy and severe systolic dysfunction compatible with cardiogenic shock. Additionally, he presented with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and antibody detection by chromatographic immunoassay were negative. A previously ordered gene panel for pre-existing sensorineural hearing loss showed a pathological mutation in the SCL29A3 gene compatible with H syndrome. Computed tomography scan revealed extensive alveolar infiltrates in the lungs and multiple poor defined hypodense lesions in liver, spleen, and kidneys; adenopathy; and cardiomegaly with left ventricle subendocardial nodules. Invasive mechanical ventilation, broad antibiotic and antifungal coverage showed no significant response. Therefore, Tocilizumab as compassionate use together with pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone was initiated. Improvement was impressive leading to normalization of inflammation markers, liver and kidney function, and stabilising heart function. Two weeks later, he was discharged and has been clinically well since then on two weekly administration of Tocilizumab. CONCLUSIONS: We report the most severe disease course produced by HS described so far in the literature. Our patient’s manifestations included uncommon, new complications such as acute heart failure with severe systolic dysfunction, multi-organ cell infiltrate, and digital ischemia. Most of the clinical symptoms of our patient could have been explained by SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating the importance of a detailed differential diagnosis to ensure optimal treatment. Although the mechanism of autoinflammation of HS remains uncertain, the good response of our patient to Tocilizumab makes a case for the important role of IL-6 in this syndrome and for considering Tocilizumab as a first-line treatment, at least in severely affected patients.","Ventura-Espejo, Laura; Gracia-Darder, Inés; Escribá-Bori, Silvia; Amador-González, Eva Regina; Martín-Santiago, Ana; Ramakers, Jan",Pediatr Rheumatol Online J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34193201/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12969-021-00586-2,359

If a traveler carrying dengue virus visits open green space and is bitten by mosquitoes, a local outbreak can ensue. In the present study, we aimed to understand the movement patterns of international travelers in Tokyo using mobile phone data, with the goal of identifying geographical foci of dengue transmission. We analyzed datasets based on mobile phone access to WiFi systems and measured the spatial distribution of international visitors in Tokyo on two specific dates (one weekday in July 2017 and another weekday in August 2017). Mobile phone users were classified by nationality into three groups according to risk of dengue transmission. Sixteen national parks were selected based on their involvement in a 2014 dengue outbreak and abundance of Aedes mosquitoes. We found that not all national parks were visited by international travelers and that visits to cemeteries were very infrequent. We also found that travelers from countries with high dengue prevalence were less likely to visit national parks compared with travelers from dengue-free countries. Travelers from countries with sporadic dengue cases and countries with regional transmission tended to visit common destinations. By contrast, the travel footprints of visitors from countries with continuous dengue transmission were focused on non-green spaces. Entomological surveillance in Tokyo has been restricted to national parks since the 2014 dengue outbreak. However, our results indicate that areas subject to surveillance should include both public and private green spaces near tourist sites.","Yuan, Baoyin; Lee, Hyojung; Nishiura, Hiroshi",Theor Biol Med Model,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12976-021-00149-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34602095/,359

In developed countries KD is the commonest cause of acquired heart disease in childhood. The aetiology of KD remains unknown, and it is currently believed that one or more as yet unidentified infectious agents induce an intense inflammatory host response in genetically susceptible individuals. Genetic studies have identified several susceptibility genes for KD and its sequelae in different ethnic populations, including FCGR2A, CD40, ITPKC, FAM167A-BLK and CASP3, as well as genes influencing response to intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and aneurysm formation such as FCGR3B, and transforming growth factor (TGF) β pathway genes. IVIG and aspirin are effective therapeutically, but recent clinical trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that the addition of corticosteroids to IVIG is beneficial for the prevention of coronary artery aneurysms (CAA) in severe cases with highest risk of IVIG resistance. Outside of Japan, however, clinical scores to predict IVIG resistance perform suboptimally. Furthermore, the evidence base does not provide clear guidance on which corticosteroid regimen is most effective. Other therapies, including anti-TNFα, could also have a role for IVIG-resistant KD. Irrespective of these caveats, it is clear that therapy that reduces inflammation in acute KD, improves outcome. This paper summarises recent advances in the understanding of KD pathogenesis and therapeutics, and provides an approach for managing KD patients in the UK in the light of these advances.","Eleftheriou, D; Levin, M; Shingadia, D; Tulloh, R; Klein, NJ; Brogan, PA",Arch Dis Child,https://doi.org/10.1136/archdischild-2012-302841; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24162006/,359

Up to this date, there is no scientific evidence that proves that a COVID-19 corpse is still infectious. Different guidelines are being followed worldwide on how to deal with a COVID-19 positive corpse. The aim of this review is to compare different guidelines and literature on best practice for handling a COVID-19 positive corpse. RESULTS: The guidelines vary greatly in the use of PPE's and other safety measures especially during autopsy. There is great variation in the use of disinfectant and its concentration. Also recommended funeral services and contact with relatives vary greatly. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, there is very limited scientific evidence on which the researched guidelines are based. It is unclear why some guidelines propose a “business as usual” attitude and others a “code-red” attitude.

The pandemic has been a tough test for all European national health systems and their capability to provide an adequate reaction. METHODS: The present work aims to reveal correlations between parameters such as COVID-19 incidence, ICU bed occupancy, ICU excess area, and mortality in Italian regions. Public data for the period of March 1 to July 16, 2020, were analyzed using several mathematical and statistical methods. RESULTS: The analysis defined two separate groups of Italian regions. The examined variables considered within these groups were interlinked and dependent on each other. The regions of the two groups shared the same kind of fitted model (linear) explaining mortality as a function of cumulative incidence, but with higher value of the constant in one group, so characterized by a high intrinsic “strength” of the pandemic, certainly playing a major role in the generation of a large number of severe and life-threatening cases. These results are confirmed at European level. Other factors may condition mortality and be linked to incidence, such as ICU saturation and excess. CONCLUSIONS: These quantitative results could be a very helpful tool to set up preventive measures and optimize biomedical interventions before the pandemic, in its recurrent waves, could overcome the reaction capacity of any public health system.","Olivieri, A.; Palù, G.; Sebastiani, G.",Int J Infect Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971220322773; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971220322773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33130199/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2020.10.070,359
624433,An Online Education Method for Movement Disorders during COVID‐19: Opportunity and Experience,2021-06-02,"Topiramate (TOPAMAX®) is an anti-epileptic drug for which acute toxicity is infrequently reported. We present the case report of a five-year-old, otherwise healthy boy who presented to the emergency department (ED) for symptoms of acute encephalopathy. He was lethargic, having slurred speech, hallucinating, intermittently agitated, and had multiple episodes of urinating on himself. Computed tomography (CT) of the head, lumbar puncture, electroencephalography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were all normal. The urine drug screen was also negative. Two days after admission, a saliva toxicology screen was significant for a topiramate level of 3487.8 ng/ml, which he was not taking and which his mother admitted taking for weight loss. The patient was observed for two days, over which time his symptoms completely resolved, and he was back to baseline. The following is the take-away for physicians: Careful history-taking should bedone to identify potential drug exposures in children presenting with acute encephalopathy. Especially, given the emerging off-label use of drugs, like in this case, topiramate, which was used by the mother for weight loss. We postulated a possible idiosyncratic reaction vs true drug toxicity, which correlates with findings in a previous case reportout of Boston Children’s Hospital by Taub et al.; and in this case, serum level was about one-third the reported level in this case report(. )The patient presented with comparable symptoms and time to recovery.","Baidoun, Mohammad; Elgendy, Mohamed",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33842124/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.13747,359
625690,Ceylon cinnamon and its major compound Cinnamaldehyde can limit overshooting inflammatory signaling and angiogenesis in vitro: implications for COVID-19 treatment,2021-06-16,"PURPOSE: In February 2020, Italy became the first European country to face the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. The concerns of infection, financial worries, loss of freedom, and isolation during the ongoing pandemic can lead to negative psychological effects, including anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The main aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship between pandemic-related stress and pregnancy-specific stress and assess their role in the development of psychiatric symptoms. We predicted that pregnancy-specific stress would mediate an association of pandemic-related stress with psychiatric symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 258 pregnant women were assessed for general emotional symptoms with the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), and an Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder screening (OCD). The Revised Prenatal Distress Questionnaire (NuPDQ) and the Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Stress Scale (PREPS) were administered as measures of pregnancy-specific stress (PSS and pandemic-related, respectively). Mediation effects by NuPDQ for PREPS stress scales on psychiatric outcomes were calculated, using regression series and correcting for general covariates. RESULTS: Almost a third of the sample reported clinically relevant anxiety levels (32.6%), 11.2% were positive for OCD screening and less than 5% were positive for depression screening. The stress related to feeling unprepared for delivery and postpartum (PREPS-PS) predicted PHQ-2 score, both directly and indirectly via PSS, and it predicted GAD-7 score only indirectly. The stress related to fear of infection (PREPS-PIS) was directly associated to GAD-7 score and – through PSS – to PHQ-2 score and OCD. CONCLUSION: The pandemic onset contributed to poor mental health, especially anxiety, in a substantial portion of Italian pregnant women. Our results emphasize the importance of strategies to reduce pregnancy-specific stress, as well as to diminish stress due to the pandemic. Identifying risk factors for psychological suffering is important to prevent potential long-term consequences for mothers and their offspring.","Colli, Chiara; Penengo, Chiara; Garzitto, Marco; Driul, Lorenza; Sala, Alessia; Degano, Matilde; Preis, Heidi; Lobel, Marci; Balestrieri, Matteo",Int J Womens Health,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijwh.s315467; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34262355/,359

To increase uptake, we developed a peer outreach and navigation PrEP intervention. Semi-structured qualitative interviews with 32 cisgender women and 3 transgender women were conducted to assess the intervention. We used a thematic approach to identify barriers to, and facilitators of the intervention. Facilitators included interest in PrEP, offer of health and social services, the intervention’s women-focused approach, and peer outreach and navigation. Barriers were perceived HIV risk, concerns about medication side effects or interactions, housing insecurity and travel, co-occurring health-related conditions, and caregiving responsibilities. We recommend that future interventions consider packaging PrEP in local community settings, such as syringe exchange programs; include services such as food and housing assistance; use peers to recruit and educate women; integrate a culturally appropriate women’s focus; and consider providing same-day PrEP.","Walters, Suzan M.; Platt, Joey; Anakaraonye, Amarachi; Golub, Sarit A.; Cunningham, Chinazo O.; Norton, Brianna L.; Sevelius, Jae M.; Blackstock, Oni J.",AIDS Behav,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34138377/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10461-021-03353-2,359

No specific drug is currently available for the effective treatment of CSFV infection; however, RNA interference (RNAi) has been applied successfully to inhibit the replication of human and other animal viruses. In this study, three effective siRNAs targeting NS3 of CSFV were selected. siNS3-2 targeting NS3 gene was chosen for further experimentation, while siN1 and siN2 targeting N(pro) gene, and siNS5B targeting NS5B gene describe previously. Single, double and quadruple anti-CSFV siRNA expression plasmids, with loxp sites at each end of the selectable marker genes, were constructed and analyzed using the same promoters or four different promoters, targeting N(pro), NS3 and NS5B genes of CSFV. Results indicate that single or multiple siRNA expression plasmids can efficiently inhibit CSFV replication and that inhibition was markedly stronger when multiple siRNAs were expressed targeting different genes of CSFV. Since RNAi applied to anti-CSFV research, this study provides anti-CSFV methods by single and multiple siRNA expression which can target most viral isolates of different subtypes and prevent viral escape. It also provides a basis for development of CSFV-resistant transgenic pigs.","Li, Jiangnan; Dai, Yajuan; Liu, Shuai; Guo, Huancheng; Wang, Tiedong; Ouyang, Hongsheng; Tu, Changchun",Antiviral Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354211003469; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21699919/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2011.06.005; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354211003469,359

High TGE yields are heavily dependent on efficient delivery of plasmid DNA across both the plasma and nuclear membranes. Here, we harness the protein nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK-A) that contains a nuclear localisation signal (NLS) to enhance DNA delivery into the nucleus of CHO cells. We show that co-expression of NDPK-A during transient expression results in improved transfection efficiency in CHO cells, presumably due to enhanced transportation of plasmid DNA into the nucleus via the nuclear pore complex. Furthermore, introduction of the Epstein Barr Nuclear Antigen-1 (EBNA-1), a protein that is capable of inducing extrachromosomal maintenance, when coupled with complementary oriP elements on a transient plasmid, was utilised to reduce the effect of plasmid dilution. Whilst there was attenuated growth upon introduction of the EBNA-1 system into CHO cells, when both NDPK-A nuclear import and EBNA-1 mediated technologies were employed together this resulted in enhanced transient recombinant protein yields superior to those generated using either approach independently, including when expressing the complex SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein.","Budge, James D.; Young, Robert J.; Smales, Christopher Mark",Front Bioeng Biotechnol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fbioe.2021.679448; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34150735/,359

OBJECTIVES: This study was designed to assess the attitudes of 3rd-year anesthesiology residents toward an independent one month-length clinical care course for patients with COVID-19. METHODS: A closed self-administered questionnaire was developed to assess the attitudes of 3rd-year clinical anesthesiology residents. A self-administered closed questionnaire was developed. Cronbach’s alpha was calculated to measure the reliability of the questionnaire; added with a factor analysis process. RESULTS: All 19 clinical anesthesiology residents took part in the study, with a 100% response rate. Cronbach’s alpha for the reliability of the questionnaire was 0.678. The eigenvalue for 8 factors was equal to 1; however, further assessment led us to 7 factors. CONCLUSIONS: This one-month period could improve the competencies of the 3rd year clinical anesthesiology residents based on their viewpoints. Since the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing health and social problem worldwide, 3rd-year anesthesiology residents could help the health system to recover health care delivery faults regarding manpower; a promising point for crisis preparedness in the COVID-19 pandemic.

626536,Two complementary model-based methods for calculating the risk of international spreading of a novel virus from the outbreak epicentre. The case of COVID-19,2020-06-09,"Analysing infection and mortality data for COVID-19 as a function of days for 54 countries across all continents, we show that there is a simple scaling behaviour connecting these two quantities for any given nation when the data is segmented over few ranges of dates covering the most rapid spread of the pandemic and the recovery, wherever achieved. This scaling is described by two parameters, one representing a shift along the time axis and the other is a normalisation factor, providing a reliable definition of the mortality rate for each country in a given period. The number of segments for any country required in our analyses turns out to be surprisingly few with as many as 16 out of 54 countries being described by a single segment and no country requiring more than three segments. Estimates of the shift and mortality for these 54 countries in different periods show large spreads ranging over 0-16 days and 0.45-19.96%, respectively. Shift and mortality are found to be inversely correlated. Analyses of number of tests carried out for detecting COVID-19 and the number of infections detected due to such tests suggest that an effective way to increase the shift, and therefore, decrease mortality, is to increase number of tests per infection detected. This points to the need of a dynamic management of testing that should accelerate with the rise of the pandemic; it also suggests a basis for adjusting variations in the testing patterns in different geographical locations within a given country.","Das, R.; Hossain, A.; Mandal, S.; Pariari, D.; Rohj, R.

HPIV infections do not confer complete protective immunity so reinfections occur throughout life. Since no effective vaccine is available for the two virus subtypes, comprehensive understanding of HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 genetic and epidemic features is important for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 infections. Relatively few whole genome sequences are available for both HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 viruses, so our study sought to provide whole genome sequences from multiple countries to further the understanding of the global diversity of HPIV at a whole-genome level. We collected HPIV-1 and HPIV-3 samples and isolates from Argentina, Australia, France, Mexico, South Africa, Switzerland, and USA from the years 2003–2011 and sequenced the genomes of 40 HPIV-1 and 75 HPIV-3 viruses with Sanger and next-generation sequencing with the Ion Torrent, Illumina, and 454 platforms. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the HPIV-1 genome is evolving at an estimated rate of 4.97 × 10(−4) mutations/site/year (95% highest posterior density 4.55 × 10(−4) to 5.38 × 10(−4)) and the HPIV-3 genome is evolving at a similar rate (3.59 × 10(−4) mutations/site/year, 95% highest posterior density 3.26 × 10(−4) to 3.94 × 10(−4)).

Even if a rather mild course is assumed among pregnant women the measures to prevent transmission of the infection are of outstanding importance. METHODS: To screen asymptomatic pregnant women during admission to our university maternal hospital we focused on anti-SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgA antibody responses. Hundred and fifty one women admitted to the hospital for childbirth or caesarean delivery were included. In case of suspicious anti-SARS-CoV-2-antibody levels an RT-PCR was performed to confirm an ongoing infection with SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: A total of 89% showed negative results for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgA antibodies, whereas 3% were borderline and 7% positive (both labeled as suspicious). In only one patient with suspicious serology we detected SARS-CoV-2-RNA in the following RT-PCR. 2% presented anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies, all being positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2-IgA. The observed positive rate of our study collective of 10.6% seemed much higher than the expected one (1.3%) based on the reports of the Robert Koch Institute and the specifications given by the test's manufacturer. The expected positive predictive value (PPV) was 4.3-6.7 times higher than the observed one. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this is the first report of anti-SARS-CoV-2-antibody levels in the peripartum period of asymptomatic women. As the positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 serology poorly correlated with the confirmatory RT-PCR and the fact that mainly the detection of the virus by PCR correlates with the patient's infectiousness we suggest to rather perform a SARS-CoV-2-PCR-based admission screening in perinatal centers to prevent the spread of the disease.","Häusler, Sebastian; Weigl, Marco; Ambrosch, Andreas; Gruber, Rudolf; Seelbach-Göbel, Birgit; Fill Malfertheiner, Sara",J Perinat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33629574/; https://doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2021-0001,359

They are prone to acquiring the infection and are threatened by high mortality rates in case of infection. However, HD patients were not included in the efficacy trials of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. Such efficacy data would have been critical because HD patients show decreased responses against various other vaccines and this could translate to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as well. METHODS: We conducted a prospective cohort study that contained a group of 81 HD patients and 80 healthy controls. All of them had been vaccinated with the BioNTech/Pfizer mRNA vaccine (two doses, as per the manufacturer’s recommendation). The anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody response was measured for all participants 21 days after the second dose. The groups were compared using univariate quantile regressions and a multivariate analysis. The adverse events (AEs) of the vaccination were assessed via a questionnaire. Finally, a correlation between the HBs-Antibody response and the SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in the HD patients was established. RESULTS: The HD patients had significantly lower Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibody titres than the control patients 21 days after vaccination (median was 171 U/ml for dialysis patients and 2,500 U/ml for the controls). Further, the HD group presented less AEs than the control group. No correlation was found between the antibody response to previous Hepatitis B vaccination and that of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: HD patients present highly diminished SARS-CoV-2 S antibody titres compared to a cohort of controls. Therefore, they could be much less protected by SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccinations than expected. Further studies to test alternative vaccination schemes should be considered.","Simon, Benedikt; Rubey, Harald; Treipl, Andreas; Gromann, Martin; Hemedi, Boris; Zehetmayer, Sonja; Kirsch, Bernhard",Nephrol Dial Transplant,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33999200/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ndt/gfab179,359

In parts of Cambodia and in many other parts of the world, irrigation of rice with groundwater results in arsenic (As) accumulation in soil and rice, leading to health concerns associated with rice consumption. At times, some As is present as relatively nontoxic, non-regulated, dimethylarsinic acid (DMA). Low levels of zinc (Zn) have been found in rice from Bangladesh, Cambodia, and China where As levels in rice are high. Furthermore, there have been claims that Zn deficiency is responsible for stunting the growth of children in Cambodia and elsewhere, however in rural Asia, rice is the major source of Zn. Current data are inadequate for both Zn and DMA in Cambodian rice. OBJECTIVES. The present study aimed to provide a preliminary evaluation of the relationship between the content of Zn and DMA in rice grain in Preak Russey, an area with elevated levels of As in groundwater and to improve the management of Zn deficiency in rice. METHODS. Rice agriculture was evaluated along the Mekong River in Cambodia. Analyses for metals, total As, and As species in rice and water were conducted by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Analysis of total Zn and As in soils and total Zn in rice were analyzed using X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry. RESULTS. Rice in Preak Russey had Zn concentrations less than a third the level recommended by the United Nations World Food Programme. There was a significant (p < 0.05) negative correlation between the Zn content of rice and DMA in rice with the lowest Zn and highest DMA levels occurring near irrigation wells, the source of As. CONCLUSIONS. The highest levels of DMA in rice were associated with Zn deficiency in rice. COMPETING INTERESTS.

In this work, a three dimensional Euler–Lagrangian model is used to understand the transmission and evaporation of micrometer-sized droplets in such cases. The effect of turbulence created by the air puff associated with coughing has been considered. Different possible scenarios varying in the presence of air ventilation within the elevator, number of persons coughing, direction of ejection of cough droplets, and ambient relative humidity and temperature have been postulated and simulated. The results obtained show that in the presence of proper ventilation within the elevator, most of the ejected cough droplets fall to the ground before impacting other persons traveling in the same elevator.

Doing so requires inter- and transdisciplinary approaches across humanities, arts, social sciences, and science and technology disciplines. These approaches include culturally diverse knowledge systems, such as indigenous ones, that locate sustainable use of and relationships to marine ecosystems. This paper contributes to this agenda through a case-study of relationships between coastal ecosystems and human wellbeing in Aotearoa New Zealand. This article highlights interconnected cultural and wellbeing benefits of, and socio-ecological relationships between, these coastal ecosystems drawing on a case study of one ocean-based, ‘immersive’ leisure activity, surfing. Further, it examines how these relationships impact human physical, emotional and spiritual wellbeing, and the wellbeing of communities and ecosystems. The research illustrates that surfing creates strong bonds between practitioners and coastal places, linking the health of marine environments and people. We demonstrate the value of a transdisciplinary place-based approach that integrates research across the humanities and social sciences and engages with Indigenous knowledge (Mātauranga Māori). This argument for multicultural co-learning shows the value of Western and Māori vantage points for how we understand coastal blue spaces. Indigenous perspectives, we conclude, deepen appreciation, as well as equity considerations, of how we understand place, wellbeing, and long-term sustainable relationships with marine ecosystems.","Wheaton, Belinda; Waiti, Jordan Te Aramoana; Olive, Rebecca; Kearns, Robin",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18020450; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33429986/,359

628825,What might the future bring? COVID-19 planning considerations for faculty and universities,2020-04-29,"Recently, small compound-based therapies have provided new insights into the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) by inducing oxidative impairment. Kinetin riboside (KR) and newly designed derivatives (8-azaKR, 7-deazaKR) selectively affect the molecular pathways crucial for cell growth by interfering with the redox status of cancer cells. Thus, these compounds might serve as potential alternatives in the oxidative therapy of GBM. The increased basal levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in GBM support the survival of cancer cells and cause drug resistance. The simplest approach to induce cell death is to achieve the redox threshold and circumvent the antioxidant defense mechanisms. Consequently, cells become more sensitive to oxidative stress (OS) caused by exogenous agents. Here, we investigated the effect of KR and its derivatives on the redox status of T98G cells in 2D and 3D cell culture. The use of spheroids of T98G cells enabled the selection of one derivative—7-deazaKR—with comparable antitumor activity to KR. Both compounds induced ROS generation and genotoxic OS, resulting in lipid peroxidation and leading to apoptosis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that KR and 7-deazaKR modulate the cellular redox environment of T98G cells, and vulnerability of these cells is dependent on their antioxidant capacity.","Orlicka-Płocka, Marta; Fedoruk-Wyszomirska, Agnieszka; Gurda-Woźna, Dorota; Pawelczak, Paweł; Krawczyk, Patrycja; Giel-Pietraszuk, Małgorzata; Framski, Grzegorz; Ostrowski, Tomasz; Wyszko, Eliza",Antioxidants (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox10060950; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34204594/,359
629228,"Projecting the impact of a two-dose COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Ontario, Canada",2020-12-11,"To explore a method for enhancing the immobilization and hybridization efficiency of oligonucleotides on DNA microarrays, conventional protocols of poly‐L‐lysine coating were modified by means of surface chemistry, namely, the slides were prepared by the covalently coupling of poly‐L‐lysine to a glycidoxy‐modified glass surface. The modified slides were then used to print microarrays for the detection of the SARS coronavirus by means of 60mer oligonucleotide probes. The characteristics of the modified slides concerning immobilization efficiency, hybridization dynamics, and probe stripping cycles were determined. The improved surface exhibited high immobilization efficiency, a good quality uniformity, and satisfactory hybridization dynamics. The spotting concentration of 10 μmol/L can meet the requirements of detection; the spots were approximately 170 nm in diameter; the mean fluorescence intensity of the SARS spots were between 3.2 × 10(4) and 5.0 × 10(4) after hybridization. Furthermore, the microarrays prepared by this method demonstrated more resistance to consecutive probe stripping cycles. The activated GOPS‐PLL slide could undergo hybridization stripping cycles for at least three cycles, and the highest loss in fluorescence intensity was found to be only 11.9 % after the third hybridization. The modified slides using the above‐mentioned method were superior to those slides treated with conventional approaches, which theoretically agrees with the fact that modification by surface chemistry attaches the DNA covalently firmly to the slides. This protocol may have great promise in the future for application in large‐scale manufacture.","Wu, Q.; Ma, W.; Shi, R.; Zhang, B.; Mao, X.; Zheng, W.",Eng Life Sci,https://doi.org/10.1002/elsc.200520097; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32313546/,359

Two clones (pA2 and pB4) represent nucleotide base pairs at the 3′ terminus of the Miller TGEV genome. The other three clones represent various portions of the 5′ end of the E 2 gene, which codes for the major surface glycoprotein of TGEV. Each of the(32)P-labeled cDNA probes hybridized to the virulent Miller, attenuated Purdue and four field strains of TGEV. The probes detected 200 to 2000 pg of TGEV RNA extracted from density gradient purified virions and did not hybridize RNA from mock-infected cell cultures, porcine rotavirus or antigenically unrelated coronaviruses. The pB4 and Hpa-1600 probes detected TGEV RNA sequences in 79 and 88%, respectively of 34 field samples identified as TGEV positive by the immunofluorescence assay and electron microscopy (EM). The pD24 clone, which is able to differentiate TGEV from the antigenically related coronaviruses, also compared favorably with conventional methods of EM and immunofluorescence for the detection of TGEV in fecal specimens.","Benfield, D.

Here we report the genome of a virus isolated in Pennsylvania in March 2021 that was identified as lineage B.1.1.7 (VOC-202012/01) that also harbors the E484K spike mutation, which has been shown to promote “escape” from neutralizing antibodies in vitro. We compare this sequence to the only 5 other B.1.1.7+E484K genomes from Pennsylvania, all of which were isolated in mid March. Beginning in February 2021, only a small number (n=60) of isolates with this profile have been detected in the US, and only a total of 253 have been reported globally (first in the UK in December 2020). Comparative genomics of all currently available high coverage B.1.1.7+E484K genomes (n=235) available on GISAID suggested the existence of 7 distinct groups or clonal complexes (CC; as defined by GNUVID) bearing the E484K mutation raising the possibility of 7 independent acquisitions of the E484K spike mutation in each background. Phylogenetic analysis suggested the presence of at least 3 distinct clades of B.1.1.7+E484K circulating in the US, with the Pennsylvanian isolates belonging to two distinct clades.

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SETTING: Between 1 December 2019 and 8 January 2021, 3350 articles were identified. Two reviewers conducted study screening, data abstraction and quality assessment independently and in duplicate. Observational studies describing laboratory-confirmed paediatric (0–19 years old) COVID-19 were considered for inclusion. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The pooled proportions of clinical findings, treatment and outcomes were compared according to World Bank country income level and reported disease severity. RESULTS: 129 studies were included from 31 countries comprising 10 251 children of which 57.4% were hospitalised. Mean age was 7.0 years (SD 3.6), and 27.1% had a comorbidity. Fever (63.3%) and cough (33.7%) were common. Of 3670 cases, 44.1% had radiographic abnormalities. The majority of cases recovered (88.9%); however, 96 hospitalised children died. Compared with high-income countries, in low-income and middle-income countries, a lower proportion of cases were admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) (9.9% vs 26.0%) yet pooled proportion of deaths among hospitalised children was higher (relative risk 2.14, 95% CI 1.43 to 3.20). Children with severe disease received antimicrobials, inotropes and anti-inflammatory agents more frequently than those with non-severe disease. Subgroup analyses showed that a higher proportion of children with multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C) were admitted to ICU (47.1% vs 22.9%) and a higher proportion of hospitalised children with MIS-C died (4.8% vs 3.6%) compared with the overall sample.

In resource-limited settings like Nigeria, the shortage of ventilators and oxygen supply makes this option challenging. Evidence-based non-invasive alternatives to mechanical ventilation such as the use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) devices exist, but there have been concerns that non-invasive ventilation may expose healthcare workers to infection from aerosolized dispersion of SARS-CoV-2. We propose to evaluate the feasibility, adaptability and acceptability of a CPAP/O(2) helmet solution for non-invasive ventilation among patients with COVID-19 and health workers in eight COVID-19 treatment and isolation centers in Nigeria. METHODS: The study will occur in 4 stages: (1) convene a Steering Committee of key stakeholders and recruit implementation sites; (2) use the integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i-PARiHS) framework to guide a needs assessment of treatment centers’ capacity to use high-flow oxygen therapy to treat COVID-19 patients and utilize the findings to develop an implementation strategy for the use of a CPAP/O(2) helmet solution; (3) build infrastructure to support training and data monitoring processes and to develop implementation protocols to evaluate the adaptability of the strategy for the use of the CPAP/O(2) helmet; and (4) train health workers, distribute a CPAP/O(2) helmet solution for non-invasive ventilation, pilot test the implementation strategy, and assess feasibility of its use and acceptability that includes monitoring altered risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among healthcare workers. DISCUSSION: The CPAP/O(2) helmet solution for non-invasive ventilation in Nigeria can serve as a scalable model for resource-poor countries, and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, has the potential to be deployed for the treatment of pneumonia and other respiratory diseases.

Estrogen-regulated physiology is tightly controlled by factors that regulate estrogen bioavailability and receptor sensitivity, while disruption of these control mechanisms can result in loss of reproductive function, cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disease, obesity, insulin resistance, endometriosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Restoration of estrogen physiology by modulating estrogen bioavailability or receptor activity is an effective approach for treating these pathological conditions. Therapeutic interventions that block estrogen action are employed effectively for the treatment of breast and prostate cancer as well as for precocious puberty and anovulatory infertility. Theoretically, treatments that block estrogen biosynthesis should prevent estrogen action at ERs and GPER, although drug resistance and ligand-independent receptor activation may still occur. In addition, blockade of estrogen biosynthesis does not prevent activation of estrogen receptors by naturally occurring or man-made exogenous estrogens. A more complicated scenario is provided by anti-estrogen drugs that antagonize ERs since these drugs function as GPER agonists. Based upon its association with metabolic dysregulation and advanced cancer, GPER represents a therapeutic target with promise for the treatment of several critical health concerns facing Western society. Selective ligands that specifically target GPER have been developed and may soon serve as pharmacological agents for treating human disease. Here, we review current forms of estrogen therapy and the implications that GPER holds for these therapies. We also discuss existing GPER targeted drugs, additional approaches towards developing GPER-targeted therapies and how these therapies may complement existing modalities of estrogen-targeted therapy.","Rouhimoghadam, Milad; Lu, Anh S.; Salem, Aliasger K.; Filardo, Edward J.",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2020.591217; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33329395/,359

STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: In this study, we developed a predictive model to estimate the number of blood donors during the COVID‐19 incubation period among 34 provincial regions in China. Our main assumption was that blood donors of all ages in different regions have a stable blood donation intention and the same infection risk. RESULTS: First, we estimated the number of blood donors during the COVID‐19 incubation period in Wuhan city, Hubei Province, and China, from December 31, 2019 to March 17, 2020. Second, we compared the number of blood donors during the COVID‐19 incubation period in all provinces across China. In addition, we found that if all RBCs, plasma, and cryoprecipitation were stored in isolation until the 14th day, the potential risk of SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission through blood transfusion was reduced by at least 65.77% after the blood donor safely passed the COVID‐19 incubation period. Moreover, if the detection of SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA was carried out on all platelets, the potential risk would be reduced by 77.48%.

632907,Spotlight: COVID-19 PPE and Endoscopy,2020-06-23,"Measles virus (MV) enters cells by membrane fusion at the cell surface at neutral pH. Two glycoproteins mediate this process: the hemagglutinin (H) and fusion (F) proteins. The H-protein binds to receptors, while the F-protein mediates fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. H naturally interacts with at least three different receptors. The wild-type virus primarily uses the signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (SLAM, CD150) expressed on certain lymphatic cells, while the vaccine strain has gained the ability to also use the ubiquitous membrane cofactor protein (MCP, CD46), a regulator of complement activation. Additionally, MV infects polarized epithelial cells through an unidentified receptor (EpR). The footprints of the three receptors on H have been characterized, and the focus of research is shifting to the characterization of receptor-specific conformational changes that occur in the H-protein dimer and how these are transmitted to the F-protein trimer. It was also shown that MV attachment and cell entry can be readily targeted to designated receptors by adding specificity determinants to the H-protein. These studies have contributed to our understanding of membrane fusion by the glycopro-tein complex of paramyxoviruses in general.","Navaratnarajah, C. K.; Leonard, V. H.

In this study, we aimed to identify if surfaces near hospitalized patients with respiratory infections were contaminated with respiratory pathogens and to identify which surfaces were most commonly contaminated. Between September-November 2013, we collected respiratory (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) swabs from patients hospitalized with respiratory illness in adult medicine and paediatric medicine wards at two public tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh. We collected surface swabs from up to five surfaces near each case-patient including: the wall, bed rail, bed sheet, clinical file, and multipurpose towel used for care giving purposes. We tested swabs using real-time multiplex PCR for 19 viral and 12 bacterial pathogens. Case-patients with at least one pathogen detected had corresponding surface swabs tested for those same pathogens. Of 104 patients tested, 79 had a laboratory-confirmed respiratory pathogen. Of the 287 swabs collected from surfaces near these patients, 133 (46%) had evidence of contamination with at least one pathogen. The most commonly contaminated surfaces were the bed sheet and the towel. Sixty-two percent of patients with a laboratory-confirmed respiratory pathgen (49/79) had detectable viral or bacterial nucleic acid on at least one surface. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequently detected pathogen on both respiratory swabs (32%, 33/104) and on surfaces near patients positive for this organism (97%, 32/33). Surfaces near patients hospitalized with respiratory infections were frequently contaminated by pathogens, with Klebsiella pneumoniae being most common, highlighting the potential for transmission of respiratory pathogens via surfaces. Efforts to introduce routine cleaning in wards may be a feasible strategy to improve infection control, given that severe space constraints prohibit cohorting patients with respiratory illness.","Hassan, Md.

634053,Commentary: Use of biosimilars for retinal diseases in India: Challenges and concerns,2021-02-11,"SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, has caused devastating health and economic impacts around the globe since its appearance in late 2019. The advent of effective vaccines leads to open questions on how best to vaccinate the population. To address such questions, we developed a model of COVID-19 infection by age that includes the waning and boosting of immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in the context of infection and vaccination. The model also accounts for changes to infectivity of the virus, such as public health mitigation protocols over time, increases in the transmissibility of variants of concern, changes in compliance to mask wearing and social distancing, and changes in testing rates. The model is employed to study public health mitigation and vaccination of the COVID-19 epidemic in Canada, including different vaccination programs (rollout by age), and delays between doses in a two-dose vaccine. We find that the decision to delay the second dose of vaccine is appropriate in the Canadian context. We also find that the benefits of a COVID-19 vaccination program in terms of reductions in infections is increased if vaccination of 15-19 year olds are included in the vaccine rollout.","Childs, L.; Dick, D.

This systematic review aims to evaluate the association between PLR levels on admission and the severity of COVID-19 patients. Methods A systematic literature search was done on 23 July 2020 to identify peer-reviewed studies across four different databases (Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and the Cochrane Library), preprints from two databases (MedRxiv and SSRN), and grey literature from two databases (WHO COVID-19 Global Research Database and Center for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 Research Article). Research articles comparing the PLR value on admission in adult patients with COVID-19 with varying degrees of severity were included in the analysis. The following keywords were used for the search: 'COVID-19', 'PLR', 'severity', and 'mortality'. The inverse variance method was used to calculate the pooled effect standardized mean difference (SMD) along with its 95% confidence interval (CI). Results A total of seven studies were included in the meta-analysis, six of which were conducted in China. From a total of 998 participants included, 316 (31.7%) had severe diseases; and those in the severe group were generally older and had underlying diseases compared to the non-severe group. In comparison to non-severe patients, the meta-analysis showed that severe COVID-19 patients had higher PLR levels on admission (SMD 0.68; 95%CI 0.43-0.93; I2 =58%). Conclusion High PLR levels on admission were associated with severe COVID-19 cases. Therefore, on-admission PLR level is a novel, cost-effective, and readily available biomarker with a promising prognostic role for determining the severity of COVID-19 patients.","Simadibrata, D.

634268,Oculomotor nerve palsy in an asymptomatic child with COVID-19,2021-03-06,"BACKGROUND: During the outbreak of COVID-19, health care workers in the radiology department frequently interact with suspected patients and face a higher risk of infection and sudden surges in workload. High anxiety levels seriously harm physical and mental health and affect work efficiency and patient safety. Therefore, it is critical to determine anxiety levels of health care workers and explore its risk factors. MATERIAL/METHODS: Self-Rating Anxiety Scale and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale were used to evaluate the anxiety and resilience of 364 health care workers with high exposure risk from the radiology departments of 32 public hospitals in Sichuan Province, China. Multivariate linear regression was used to analyze factors related to anxiety. RESULTS: The mean anxiety score was 44.28±8.93 and 23.4% of our study participants reported mild (n=63), moderate (n=19), or severe (n=3) anxiety. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that age, job position, availability of protective materials, signs of suspected symptoms, and susceptibility to emotions and behaviors of people around them were identified as risk factors for anxiety, whereas psychological resilience was identified as a protective factor. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that the anxiety level of health care workers in the radiology department with a high exposure risk to COVID-19 was high in the early stage of the outbreak, although the majority remained within normal limits. Timely assessment and effective intervention measures can improve the mental health of these at-risk populations.","Huang, Lei; Wang, Yun; Liu, Juan; Ye, Pengfei; Chen, Xijian; Xu, Huayan; Qu, Haibo; Ning, Gang",Med Sci Monit,https://doi.org/10.12659/msm.926008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32710536/,359
634497,Indian perspective of remdesivir: A promising COVID-19 drug,2020-08-04,"New tuberculosis vaccines have made substantial progress in the development pipeline. Previous modelling suggests that adolescent/adult mass vaccination may cost-effectively contribute towards achieving global tuberculosis control goals. These analyses have not considered the budgetary feasibility of vaccine programmes. We estimate the maximum total cost that the public health sectors in India and China should expect to pay to introduce a M72/AS01(E)-like vaccine deemed cost-effective at country-specific willingness to pay thresholds for cost-effectiveness. To estimate the total disability adjusted life years (DALYs) averted by the vaccination programme, we simulated a 50% efficacy vaccine providing 10-years of protection in post-infection populations between 2027 and 2050 in India and China using a dynamic transmission model of M. tuberculosis. We investigated two mass vaccination strategies, both delivered every 10-years achieving 70% coverage: Vaccinating adults and adolescents (age ≥10y), or only the most efficient 10-year age subgroup (defined as greatest DALYs averted per vaccine given). We used country-specific thresholds for cost-effectiveness to estimate the maximum total cost (C(max)) a government should be willing to pay for each vaccination strategy. Adult/adolescent vaccination resulted in a C(max) of $21 billion (uncertainty interval [UI]: 16–27) in India, and $15B (UI:12–29) in China at willingness to pay thresholds of $264/DALY averted and $3650/DALY averted, respectively. Vaccinating the highest efficiency age group (India: 50–59y; China: 60–69y) resulted in a C(max) of $5B (UI:4–6) in India and $6B (UI:4–7) in China. Mass vaccination against tuberculosis of all adults and adolescents, deemed cost-effective, will likely impose a substantial budgetary burden. Targeted tuberculosis vaccination, deemed cost-effective, may represent a more affordable approach.","Weerasuriya, Chathika Krishan; Harris, Rebecca Claire; Quaife, Matthew; McQuaid, Christopher Finn; White, Richard G.; Gomez, Gabriela B.",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33799544/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9030245,359

Here, we investigated the potential extent of T cell cross-reactivity against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that can be conferred by other coronaviruses and influenza virus, and generated a map of public and private predicted CD8+ T cell epitopes between coronaviruses. Moreover, to assess the potential risk of self-reactivity and/or diminished T cell response for peptides identical or highly similar to the host, we identified predicted epitopes with high sequence similarity with human proteome. Lastly, we compared predicted epitopes from coronaviruses with epitopes from influenza virus deposited in IEDB to support vaccine development against different virus strains. We believe the comprehensive in silico profile of private and public predicted epitopes across coronaviruses and influenza viruses will facilitate design of vaccines capable of protecting against various viral infections.","Lee, Chloe H.; Pereira Pinho, Mariana; Buckley, Paul; Woodhouse, Isaac; Ogg, Graham; Simmons, Alison; Napolitani, Giorgio; Koohy, Hashem",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.20.107292,359

Design: Analysis of Cerner de-identified COVID-19 dataset. Setting: A total of 62 health care facilities. Participants: The cohort included 49,277 adult COVID-19 patients who were hospitalized from December 1, 2019 to November 13, 2020. Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome of interest was in-hospital mortality. The secondary outcome was non-routine discharge (discharge to destinations other than home, such as short-term hospitals or other facilities including intermediate care and skilled nursing homes). Methods: We compared patients' age, gender, individual components of Charlson and Elixhauser comorbidities, medical complications, use of do-not-resuscitate, use of palliative care, and socioeconomic status between various racial and/or ethnic groups. We further compared the rates of in-hospital mortality and non-routine discharges between various racial and/or ethnic groups. Results: Compared with White patients, in-hospital mortality was significantly higher among African American (OR 1.5; 95%CI:1.3-1.6, P<.001), Hispanic (OR1.4; 95%CI:1.3-1.6, P<.001), and Asian or Pacific Islander (OR 1.5; 95%CI: 1.1-1.9, P=.002) patients after adjustment for age and gender, Elixhauser comorbidities, do-not-resuscitate status, palliative care use, and socioeconomic status. Conclusions: Our study found that, among hospitalized patients with COVID-2019, African American, Hispanic, and Asian or Pacific Islander patients had increased mortality compared with White patients after adjusting for sociodemographic factors, comorbidities, and do-not-resuscitate/palliative care status.

636967,Gastrointestinal insights during the COVID-19 epidemic,2020-09-26,"Two electrochemical DNA hybridization biosensors (genosensors) for the detection of a 30-mer sequence unique to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus are described in this work. Both genosensors rely on the hybridization of the oligonucleotide target with its complementary probe, which is immobilized on positively charged polylysine modified screen-printed carbon electrodes (SPCEs), through electrostatic interactions. In one design, a biotinylated target is used and the detection of the hybridization reaction is monitored using alkaline phosphatase labeled streptavidin (S-AP). This enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of the substrate 3-indoxyl phosphate (3-IP) to indigo, which is then solubilized to indigo carmine and detected by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV). In the other design, the target is labeled using an Au(I) complex, sodium aurothiomalate, and the duplex formation is detected by measuring, for first time, the current generated by the hydrogen evolution catalyzed by the gold label. Using 30 min of hybridization time, a detection limit of 8 pM is calculated for the enzymatic genosensor. Although this good sensitivity cannot be reached with the metal label (0.5 nM), the use of this label allows a considerable decrease of the analysis time. Both genosensors do not require the modification of the oligonucleotide probe and using stringent experimental conditions (60 min of hybridization time and 50% formamide in the hybridization buffer) can discriminate between a complementary oligonucleotide and an oligonucleotide with a three-base mismatch.","Díaz-González, María; de la Escosura-Muñiz, Alfredo; González-García, María Begoña; Costa-García, Agustín",Biosens Bioelectron,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956566307004915; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0956566307004915; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2007.12.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18207382/,359
637113,Corrigendum: Therapeutic Potentials of Antiviral Plants Used in Traditional African Medicine With COVID-19 in Focus: A Nigerian Perspective,2021-07-20,"Background: There has been a growing global interest in the role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of diseases and the potentials of targeting the microbiome in clinical interventions. Very few clinical studies in Qatar focused on gut microbiome. This study aimed to assess the awareness of healthcare professionals, scientists, and the general public on the role of gut microbiota in health and diseases and, more specifically, in disorders of the gut–brain axis such as neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) or gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. It also aimed to evaluate the readiness of the population to engage in clinical trials involving dietary interventions or fecal transplants. Methods: A total of 156 participants were recruited to answer questionnaires—from healthcare professionals and scientists (HSs; n = 44) and the general public (n = 112). Participants from the general public self-reported their diagnosis of NDDs—autism or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (n = 36)—or GI diseases or disorders (n = 18) or as having none of them (n = 58). Two questionnaires for HSs and for the general public were distributed, and basic descriptive and statistical analyses were conducted using the Fisher's exact test. Results: Among the participating HSs, 95% admitted that they had minimum to no knowledge on the role of gut microbes in health and diseases, and only 15.9% felt that their peers were knowledgeable about it. Nevertheless, 97.7% of HSs thought that gut microbiota should be considered when devising treatment plans as 79.1% believed that gut dysbiosis is involved in the pathogenesis of diseases. For the general public, 54% stated that they have read about studies on the potential benefits of microbes in the prevention, treatment, and management of diseases, with a higher proportion of them belonging to the GI group (p = 0.0523). The GI group was also more aware of the existence of the use of fecal transplants for treating their condition (p = 0.01935). Awareness was also reflected in participants’ attempts to engage in dietary changes, as 40% tried a dietary intervention, which has noticeably changed their or their child's symptoms. This study reported a highly significant association between being exposed to multiple antibiotic courses before three years of age and being part of the NDD group (p = 0.0003). Public readiness to engage in interventions that target the gut microbiome, such as intensive dietary interventions or even fecal transplants, was perceived by HSs to be lower than what was stated by the public, with 87.96% of public being ready to engage in intensive dietary interventions and 66.98% in fecal transplants. Conclusion: The study revealed that the role of gut microbes in health and diseases, and especially through the gut–brain axis, is still unclear in both the scientific community and general public. While acknowledging the importance of gut microbes, the lack of information regarding the link between lifestyle and gut microbes is considered to hold the public in the precontemplation/contemplation stages of the transtheoretical model of behavioral change. An interdisciplinary approach to new knowledge produced by microbiome studies is needed to run awareness campaigns and continue professional development activities on the benefits of lifestyle-based modulation of gut microbiome, thus engaging the general public in lifestyle changes and facilitating clinical research in human microbiome investigations in Qatar.","Bendriss, Ghizlane; Al-Ali, Dana; Shafiq, Ameena; Laswi, Ibrahim; Mhaimeed, Nada; Salameh, Mohammad; Burney, Zain; Pillai, Krishnadev; Chaari, Ali; Zakaria, Dalia; Yousri, Noha A.",Qatar Med J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33598417/; https://doi.org/10.5339/qmj.2020.47,359

We accessed 290 household contacts whose index cases were diagnosed between 1 and 20 December 2020 (the third epidemic group), at a time when Osaka was free of the Alpha variant. We also accessed 398 household contacts whose index cases were diagnosed between 20 April and 3 May 2021 (the fourth epidemic group), by which time the Alpha variant had become dominant. We identified 124 household contacts whose index case was determined positive for the Alpha variant (Alpha group) in this fourth group. The secondary attack rates in the fourth group (34.7%) and the Alpha group (38.7%) were significantly higher than that in the third group (19.3%, p < 0.001).

Disparities in social and structural determinants of health disproportionately affect those experiencing incarceration, making them more vulnerable to COVID-19. Additionally, prisons are sites of congregate living, making it impossible to practice social distancing, and most prisons have relied only on incremental measures to reduce risk and spread of COVID-19. To more fully understand the impact that COVID-19 is having on incarcerated populations, it is critical to have systematic data on testing, test positivity, cases, and case fatality. Using data from the COVID Prison Project, we present data on 53 prison systems COVID-19 testing, test positivity, case, and case fatality by state and compare these data with each state’s general population. We do this for the early stages of the pandemic, utilizing data through July 15, 2020. RESULTS: Many states are not reporting full information on COVID testing with some also not reporting on case fatality. Among those reporting data, there is a wide variation between testing, test positivity, and case rates within prison systems and as compared to the general population. However, when more tests are deployed more cases are identified with the majority of state prisons having higher case rates than their general population. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the need for the implementation and study of COVID-19 mitigation and surveillance strategies to flatten the COVID-19 curve in prisons across the country. We call for future research to build on these data from the COVID Prison Project to protect the health of our nations’ often forgotten residents.","Lemasters, Katherine; McCauley, Erin; Nowotny, Kathryn; Brinkley-Rubinstein, Lauren",Health Justice,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40352-020-00125-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33306151/,359

Atopy and food anaphylaxis disease states require improved characterization of SARS-CoV-2 infection risk. To provide the first such characterization, we assessed serum samples of a highly atopic, food anaphylactic, asymptomatic pediatric cohort from across the US during the height of the pandemic. From our biobank, 172 pediatric patient serum samples were characterized specific to atopic, food anaphylactic, and immunologic markers in the US at the beginning of the pandemic, from 1 February to 20 April 2020. Clinical and demographic data were further analyzed in addition to sample analysis for SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG ELISA. SARS-CoV-2 antibody results were positive in six patients (4%). Nearly half of the pediatric patients had a history of asthma (49%). Total IgE, total IgG, and IgG1-3 were similar in those positive and negative to SARS-CoV-2. Median total IgG4 in the SARS-CoV-2 positive group was nearly three times (p-value = 0.02) that of the negative group. Atopy controller medications did not confer additional benefit. Our data suggest that food anaphylaxis and highly atopic children are not at increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity.

638624,The role for the metagenome in the pathogenesis of COVID-19,2020-10-07,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic continues to ravage and burden hospitals around the world. The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, and was subsequently recognized by the World Health Organization as an international public health emergency and declared a pandemic in March 2020. Since then, the disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have had an unparalleled effect on all aspects of life. OBJECTIVE: With increasing total hospitalization and intensive care unit admissions, a better understanding of features related to patients with COVID-19 could help health care workers stratify patients based on the risk of developing a more severe case of COVID-19. Using predictive models, we strive to select the features that are most associated with more severe cases of COVID-19. METHODS: Over 3 million participants reported their potential symptoms of COVID-19, along with their comorbidities and demographic information, on a smartphone-based app. Using data from the >10,000 individuals who indicated that they had tested positive for COVID-19 in the United Kingdom, we leveraged the Elastic Net regularized binary classifier to derive the predictors that are most correlated with users having a severe enough case of COVID-19 to seek treatment in a hospital setting. We then analyzed such features in relation to age and other demographics and their longitudinal trend. RESULTS: The most predictive features found include fever, use of immunosuppressant medication, use of a mobility aid, shortness of breath, and severe fatigue. Such features are age-related, and some are disproportionally high in minority populations. CONCLUSIONS: Predictors selected from the predictive models can be used to stratify patients into groups based on how much medical attention they are expected to require. This could help health care workers devote valuable resources to prevent the escalation of the disease in vulnerable populations.","Huang, Yingxiang; Radenkovic, Dina; Perez, Kevin; Nadeau, Kari; Verdin, Eric; Furman, David",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33621185/; https://doi.org/10.2196/25696,359

Chronic kidney, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and immunocompromised status were associated with higher likelihood of hospitalization. CONCLUSION: This observational study on the use of bamlanivimab and casirivimab-imdevimab in high-risk patients showed similarly low rates of hospitalization. The number and type of medical comorbidities are associated with hospitalizations after monoclonal antibody treatment.","Ganesh, Ravindra; Philpot, Lindsey M; Bierle, Dennis M; Anderson, Ryan J; Arndt, Lori L; Arndt, Richard F; Culbertson, Tracy L; Destro Borgen, Molly J; Hanson, Sara N; Kennedy, Brian D; Kottke, Brian B; Larsen, Jennifer J; Ramar, Priya; Rosedahl, Jordan K; Seville, Maria Teresa; Speicher, Leigh L; Tulledge-Scheitel, Sidna M; Wilker, Caroline G; Razonable, Raymund R",J Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34279629/,359

638715,HIF Prolyl Hydroxylase Inhibitors for COVID-19 Treatment: Pros and Cons,2021-01-29,"Abstract Necrotizing enterocolitis remains one of the most vexing problems in the neonatal intensive care unit. Risk factors for NEC include prematurity, formula feeding, and inappropriate microbial colonization of the GI tract. The pathogenesis of NEC is believed to involve weakening of the intestinal barrier by perinatal insults, translocation of luminal bacteria across the weakened barrier, an exuberant inflammatory response, and exacerbation of the barrier damage by inflammatory factors, leading to a vicious cycle of inflammation-inflicted epithelial damage. Nitric oxide (NO), produced by inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and reactive NO oxidation intermediates play a prominent role in the intestinal barrier damage by inducing enterocyte apoptosis and inhibiting the epithelial restitution processes, namely enterocyte proliferation and migration. The factors that govern iNOS upregulation in the intestine are not well understood, which hampers efforts in developing NO/iNOS-targeted therapies. Similarly, efforts to identify bacteria or bacterial colonization patterns associated with NEC have met with limited success, because the same bacterial species can be found in NEC and in non-NEC subjects. However, microbiome studies have identified the three important characteristics of early bacterial populations of the GI tract: high diversity, low complexity, and fluidity. Whether NEC is caused by specific bacteria remains a matter of debate, but data from hospital outbreaks of NEC strongly argue in favor of the infectious nature of this disease. Studies in Cronobacter muytjensii have established that the ability to induce NEC is the property of specific strains rather than the species as a whole. Progress in our understanding of the roles of bacteria in NEC will require microbiological experiments and genome-wide analysis of virulence factors.","Grishin, Anatoly; Bowling, Jordan; Bell, Brandon; Wang, Jin; Ford, Henri R.",Journal of Pediatric Surgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26577908/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022346815006156; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022346815006156; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2015.10.006,359

A respiratory prodrome was experienced by 10, and nasopharyngeal specimens were positive for enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) for 4. To determine whether an association exists between EV-D68 infection and acute flaccid myelitis, we conducted a retrospective case–control study comparing these patients with 2 groups of outpatient control children (1 group tested for acute respiratory illness and 1 for Bordetella pertussis infection). Adjusted analyses indicated that, for children with acute flaccid myelitis, the odds of having EV-D68 infection were 10.3 times greater than for those tested for acute respiratory infection and 4.5 times greater than for those tested for B. pertussis infection. No statistical association was seen between acute flaccid myelitis and non–EV-D68 enterovirus or rhinovirus infection. These findings support an association between EV-D68 infection and acute flaccid myelitis.","Aliabadi, Negar; Messacar, Kevin; Pastula, Daniel M.; Robinson, Christine C.; Leshem, Eyal; Sejvar, James J.; Nix, W.

This is because phishers are able to use similar methods to entice social network users to click on malicious links masquerading as fake news, controversial videos and other opportunities thought to be attractive or beneficial to the victim. SNSs are a phisher's “market” as they offer phishers a wide range of targets and take advantage of opportunities that exploit the behavioural vulnerabilities of their users. As such, it is important to further investigate aspects affecting behaviour when users are presented with phishing. Based on the literature studied, this research presents a theoretical model to address phishing susceptibility on SNSs. Using data collected from 215 respondents, the study examined the mediating role that information processing plays with regard to user susceptibility to social network phishing based on their personality traits, thereby identifying user characteristics that may be more susceptible than others to phishing on SNSs. The results from the structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis revealed that conscientious users were found to have a negative influence on heuristic processing, and are thus less susceptible to phishing on SNSs. The study also confirmed that heuristic processing increases susceptibility to phishing, thus supporting prior studies in this area. This research contributes to the information security discipline as it is one of the first to examine the effect of the relationship between the Big Five personality model and the heuristic-systematic model of information processing.","Frauenstein, Edwin Donald; Flowerday, Stephen",Comput Secur,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167404820301346; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cose.2020.101862; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404820301346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32501314/,359

Nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was negative by polymerase chain reaction; however, the patient was febrile and had leukocytosis, elevated troponin I, transaminitis, and acute kidney injury. Bedside echocardiogram showed decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (40% to 45%) and global hypokinesis in the setting of a type II non-ST segment myocardial infarction. Despite being on broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, the patient’s clinical condition continued to worsen. The patient was then empirically treated for MIS with intravenous immunoglobulin and methylprednisolone, which led to a rapid resolution of fever and laboratory abnormalities.

Sigma receptors (SRs) have been proposed as cancer therapeutic targets. Their main localization suggests they play a potential role in ER stress and in the triggering of the unfolded protein response (UPR). Here, we investigated the mechanisms of action of RC-106, a novel pan-SR modulator, to characterize therapeutically exploitable role of SRs in tumors. Two PC cell lines were used in all the experiments. Terminal UPR activation was evaluated by quantifying BiP, ATF4 and CHOP by Real-Time qRT-PCR, Western Blot, immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. Cell death was studied by flow cytometry. Post-transcriptional gene silencing was performed to study the interactions between SRs and UPR key proteins. RC-106 activated ER stress sensors in a dose- and time-dependent manner. It also induced ROS production accordingly with ATF4 upregulation at the same time reducing cell viability of both cell lines tested. Moreover, RC-106 exerted its effect through the induction of the terminal UPR, as shown by the activation of some of the main transducers of this pathway. Post-transcriptional silencing studies confirmed the connection between SRs and these key proteins. Overall, our data highlighted a key role of SRs in the activation of the terminal UPR pathway, thus indicating pan-SR ligands as candidates for targeting the UPR in pancreatic cancer.","Cortesi, Michela; Zamagni, Alice; Pignatta, Sara; Zanoni, Michele; Arienti, Chiara; Rossi, Daniela; Collina, Simona; Tesei, Anna",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21239012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260926/,359
642327,A modelling analysis of the effectiveness of second wave COVID-19 response strategies in Australia,2021-06-07,"Lonicera japonica Thunb. is an important medicinal plant. The secondary metabolites in L. japonica are diverse and vary in levels during development, leading to the ambiguous evaluation for its medical value. In order to reveal the regulatory mechanism of secondary metabolites during the flowering stages, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses were performed. The integration analysis of omic-data illustrated that the metabolic changes over the flower developmental stages were mainly involved in sugar metabolism, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis, carbon conversion, and secondary metabolism. Further proteomic analysis revealed that uniquely identified proteins were mainly involved in glycolysis/phenylpropanoids and tricarboxylic acid cycle/terpenoid backbone pathways in early and late stages, respectively. Transketolase was commonly identified in the 5 developmental stages and 2-fold increase in gold flowering stage compared with juvenile bud stage. Simple phenylpropanoids/flavonoids and 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate were accumulated in early stages and upregulated in late stages, respectively. These results indicate that phenylpropanoids were accumulated attributing to the activated glycolysis process in the early stages, while the terpenoids biosynthetic pathways might be promoted by the transketolase-contained regulatory circuit in the late stages of L. japonica flower development.

Maternal-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was initially deemed uncertain; however, recently a few cases of vertical transmission have been reported. The intrauterine mechanisms, besides direct vertical transmission, leading to the perinatal adverse outcomes are not well understood. METHODS: Multiple maternal, placental, and neonatal swabs were collected for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Serology of immunoglobulins against SARS-CoV-2 was tested in maternal, umbilical cord, and neonatal blood. Placental examination included immunohistochemical investigation against SARS-CoV-2 antigen expression, with SARS-CoV-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) in situ hybridization and transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: RT-qPCRs of the oropharynx, maternal blood, vagina, placenta, and urine were all positive over a period of 6 days, while breast milk, feces, and all neonatal samples tested negative. Placental findings showed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 particles with generalized inflammation characterized by histiocytic intervillositis with diffuse perivillous fibrin depositions with damage to the syncytiotrophoblasts. CONCLUSIONS: Placental infection by SARS-CoV-2 leads to fibrin depositions hampering fetal-maternal gas exchange with resulting fetal distress necessitating a premature emergency cesarean section. Postpartum, the neonate showed a fetal or pediatric inflammatory multisystem-like syndrome with coronary artery ectasia temporarily associated with SARS-CoV-2 for which admittance and care on the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) were required, despite being negative for SARS-CoV-2.

Background Timely influenza surveillance is important to monitor influenza epidemics. Objectives (i) To calculate the epidemic threshold for influenza‐like illness (ILI) and acute respiratory infections (ARI) in 19 countries, as well as the thresholds for different levels of intensity. (ii) To evaluate the performance of these thresholds. Methods The moving epidemic method (MEM) has been developed to determine the baseline influenza activity and an epidemic threshold. False alerts, detection lags and timeliness of the detection of epidemics were calculated. The performance was evaluated using a cross‐validation procedure. Results The overall sensitivity of the MEM threshold was 71·8% and the specificity was 95·5%. The median of the timeliness was 1 week (range: 0–4·5). Conclusions The method produced a robust and specific signal to detect influenza epidemics. The good balance between the sensitivity and specificity of the epidemic threshold to detect seasonal epidemics and avoid false alerts has advantages for public health purposes. This method may serve as standard to define the start of the annual influenza epidemic in countries in Europe.","Vega, Tomás; Lozano, Jose Eugenio; Meerhoff, Tamara; Snacken, René; Mott, Joshua; Ortiz de Lejarazu, Raul; Nunes, Baltazar",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22897919/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1750-2659.2012.00422.x,359

In this review, we systematically reviewed the published literature in the field of liver function tests profile in COVID-19 patients at the admission time. MATERIALS AND METHODS: systematic literature search were performed in EMBASE, PubMed, Science Direct, and Scopus using “severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2)”, “SARS,” “SARS-CoV,” “coronavirus,” “novel coronavirus,” “liver,” “hepatitis,” “Liver function” keywords. The search was limited to range from 2019 to May 19, 2020. RESULTS: From a total 7298 articles, 145 were screened and 18 were eligible for further analysis. The highest rate of liver associated comorbidities was reported 11%. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were the most frequent assessed enzymes. Increase in AST level was seen in 10%–53% of patients while The ALT increase was seen in 5%–28% of COVID-19 patients at the admission time. The prothrombin time was increase in 7%–12% of patients and the D-dimer was reports increase in 14%–36% of COVID-19 patients at the admission time. Furthermore, albumin decrease was seen in 6%–98% of COVID-19 patients at the admission time.

Most studies focused on COVID-19 patients from a single hospital. Results based on patients from multiple health systems have not been reported. The objective of this study is to examine variation in patient characteristics, outcomes, and healthcare utilization by neighborhood social conditions among COVID-19 patients. METHODS: We extracted electronic health record data for 23,300 community dwelling COVID-19 patients in New York City between March 1(st) and June 11(th), 2020 from all care settings, including hospitalized patients, patients who presented to the emergency department without hospitalization, and patients with ambulatory visits only. Zip Code Tabulation Area—level social conditions were measured by the Social Deprivation Index (SDI). Using logistic regressions and Cox proportional-hazards models, we examined the association between SDI quintiles and hospitalization and death, controlling for race, ethnicity, and other patient characteristics. RESULTS: Among 23,300 community dwelling COVID-19 patients, 60.7% were from neighborhoods with disadvantaged social conditions (top SDI quintile), although these neighborhoods only account for 34% of overall population. Compared to socially advantaged patients (bottom SDI quintile), socially disadvantaged patients (top SDI quintile) were older (median age 55 vs. 53, P<0.001), more likely to be black (23.1% vs. 6.4%, P<0.001) or Hispanic (25.4% vs. 8.5%, P<0.001), and more likely to have chronic conditions (e.g., diabetes: 21.9% vs. 10.5%, P<0.001). Logistic and Cox regressions showed that patients with disadvantaged social conditions had higher risk for hospitalization (odds ratio: 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [1.46, 1.94]; P<0.001) and mortality (hazard ratio: 1.91; 95% CI: [1.35, 2.70]; P<0.001), adjusting for other patient characteristics.

Digital tools can support the data consolidation needed for meeting preparation and data sharing during complex case reviews. In this paper, we assessed the value of a clinical decision support tool on workflow efficiency and conducting a complex case review of a dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) tumor. METHODS: Case presentation was performed by each unique clinical specialty that had relevant information about the patient; an oncologist, a pathologist, and a radiologist. Virtual discussion was completed online with case presentation and documentation with NAVIFY Tumor Board. Workflow efficiency assessment was done through interviews and observation of the # of steps across different team members involved in preparing and conducting cancer multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings before and after the implementation of the NAVIFY Tumor Board solution. RESULTS: Case review consisted of surgical and therapeutic intervention history, distinct histological and sequencing patterns representative of DFSP, with radiological review to determine areas for surgical intervention. Consolidation of clinical input led to a recommendation of a formal external hemipelvectomy with potential chemotherapy. Workflow assessment demonstrated a 46% total reduction in the # of steps for meeting preparation (from 69 to 37), with specific changes based on role: data manager (33 to 15), pathologist (26 to 13), radiologist (no change), and logistics (5 to 4). There was a 31% total reduction in the # of steps for conducting the meeting (from 51 to 35). CONCLUSION: Utilizing a digital clinical decision support tool helped to consolidate patient data and improved case presentation through workflow efficiency. This allowed for improved interdisciplinary discussion on a complex DFSP case and supported the determination of a clinical decision.","Soo, Khee Chee; Al Jajeh, Issam; Quah, Raymond; Seah, Hoe Kuen Brandon; Soon, Sharon; Walker, Espen",J Multidiscip Healthc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34045862/; https://doi.org/10.2147/jmdh.s307470,359
644169,Multidisciplinary Approach to Reduce OR Delay and Cancellations Due to Covid-19 Testing,2021-08-31,"BACKGROUND: Infective endocarditis (IE) is challenging to manage in the COVID-19 lockdown period, in part given its reliance on echocardiography for diagnosis and management and the associated virus transmission risks to patients and healthcare workers. This study assesses utilisation of the endocarditis team (ET) in limiting routine echocardiography, especially transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE), in patients with suspected IE, and explores the effect on clinical outcomes. METHODS: All patients discussed at the ET meeting at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust during the first lockdown in the UK (23 March to 8 July 2020) were prospectively included and analysed in this observational study. RESULTS: In total, 38 patients were referred for ET review (71% male, median age 54 [interquartile range 48, 65.5] years). At the time of ET discussion, 21% had no echo imaging, 16% had point-of-care ultrasound only, and 63% had formal TTE. In total, only 16% underwent TOE. The ability of echocardiography, in those where it was performed, to affect IE diagnosis according to the Modified Duke Criteria was significant (p=0.0099); however, sensitivity was not affected. All-cause mortality was 17% at 30 days and 25% at 12 months from ET discussion in those with confirmed IE. CONCLUSION: Limiting echocardiography in patients with a low pretest probability (not probable or definite IE according to the Modified Duke Criteria) did not affect the diagnostic ability of the Modified Duke Criteria to rule out IE in this small study. Moreover, restricting nonessential echocardiography, and importantly TOE, in patients with suspected IE through use of the ET did not impact all-cause mortality.","Hartley, Adam; El-Sayed, Ahmed; Abbara, Aula; Henderson, Jamie; Ghazy, Anan; Davies, Frances; Price, James R.; Punjabi, Prakash P.; Anderson, Jon; Casula, Roberto; Naderi, Hafiz; Asaria, Perviz; Sutaria, Nilesh; Malik, Iqbal S.; Pabari, Punam A.; Rana, Bushra S.",Cardiol Res Pract,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5565200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34367691/,359

Calves were separated from the dam and fed 2L of colostrum in nipple-bottles or allowed to nurse the dam for 3 d. Calves were housed in individual hutches or wooden pens in a barn. Intake of colostrum by calves allowed to nurse the dam was not controlled. Serum IgG and IgM concentrations at 24h of age were greater for calves that nursed the dam. Scours were less severe when calves were housed in hutches, but number of days scouring was unaffected by treatment. Calves fed colostrum in nipple-bottles and housed in the barn consumed more starter than did other calves from 3 to 5 wk of age. The BW were greater for calves allowed to nurse the dam and housed in hutches. Feed efficiency over the 35-d study was improved when calves nursed the dam. Optimal transfer of passive immunity and housing in hutches appeared to maximize health and growth in this study.","Quigley, J. D.; Martin, K. R.; Bemis, D. A.; Potgieter, L.N.D.; Reinemeyer, C.

SARS-CoV-2 infection is characterized by a wide range of clinical manifestations, ranging from absence of symptoms to severe forms that need intensive care treatment. Here, plasma-EDTA samples of 30 patients compared with age- and sex-matched controls were analyzed via untargeted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics and lipidomics. With the same approach, the effect of tocilizumab administration was evaluated in a subset of patients. Despite the heterogeneity of the clinical symptoms, COVID-19 patients are characterized by common plasma metabolomic and lipidomic signatures (91.7% and 87.5% accuracy, respectively, when compared to controls). Tocilizumab treatment resulted in at least partial reversion of the metabolic alterations due to SARS-CoV-2 infection. In conclusion, NMR-based metabolomic and lipidomic profiling provides novel insights into the pathophysiological mechanism of human response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and to monitor treatment outcomes.","Meoni, Gaia; Ghini, Veronica; Maggi, Laura; Vignoli, Alessia; Mazzoni, Alessio; Salvati, Lorenzo; Capone, Manuela; Vanni, Anna; Tenori, Leonardo; Fontanari, Paolo; Lavorini, Federico; Peris, Adriano; Bartoloni, Alessandro; Liotta, Francesco; Cosmi, Lorenzo; Luchinat, Claudio; Annunziato, Francesco; Turano, Paola",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1009243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33524041/,359

This proves difficult in domestic isolation, as patients are not continuously monitored. The aim of our study was to establish a telemonitoring system in this setting. METHODS: Oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, heart rate and temperature were measured every 15 minutes using an in-ear device. The data was transmitted to the Telecovid Centre via mobile network or internet and monitored 24/7 by a trained team. The data were supplemented by daily telephone calls. The patients´ individual risk was assessed using a modified National Early Warning Score. In case of a deterioration, a physician initiated the appropriate measures. Covid-19 Patients were included if they were older than 60 years or fulfilled at least one of the following conditions: pre-existing disease (cardiovascular, pulmonary, immunologic), obesity (BMI >35), diabetes mellitus, hypertension, active malignancy, or pregnancy. FINDINGS: 153 patients (median age 59 years, 77 female) were included. Patients were monitored for 9 days (median, IQR 6–13 days) with a daily monitoring time of 13.3 hours (median, IQR 9.4–17.0 hours). 20 patients were referred to the clinic by the Telecovid team. 3 of these required intensive care without invasive ventilation, 4 with invasive ventilation, 1 of the latter died. All patients agreed that the device was easy to use. About 90% of hospitalised patients indicated that they would have delayed hospitalisation further if they had not been part of the study. INTERPRETATION: Our study demonstrates the successful implementation of a remote monitoring system in a pandemic situation.

Antibody‐dependent enhancement (ADE) of FIPV infection has been recognized, and cellular immunity is considered to play an important role in preventing the onset of feline infectious peritonitis. In the present study, whether or not the T helper (Th)1 epitope was present in the spike (S)2 domain was investigated, the ADE epitope being thought to be absent from this domain. Three kinds of protein derived from the C‐terminal S2 domain of S protein of the FIPV KU‐2 strain were developed using a baculovirus expression system. These expressed proteins were the pre‐coil region which is the N‐terminal side of the putative fusion protein (FP), the region from FP to the heptad repeat (HR)2 (FP‐HR2) region, and the inter‐helical region which is sandwiched between HR1 and HR2. The ability of three baculovirus‐expressed proteins to induce Th1‐ and Th2‐type immune responses was investigated in a mouse model. It was shown that FP‐HR2 protein induced marked Th1‐ and Th2‐type immune responses. Furthermore, 30 peptides derived from the FP‐HR2 region were synthesized. Five and 16 peptides which included the Th1 and Th2 epitopes, respectively, were identified. Of these, four peptides which included both Th1 and Th2 epitopes were identified. These findings suggest that the identification of Th1 epitopes in the S2 domain of FIPV has important implications in the cat.","Satoh, Ryoichi; Kobayashi, Hiroshige; Takano, Tomomi; Motokawa, Kenji; Kusuhara, Hajime; Hohdatsu, Tsutomu",Microbiol Immunol,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1348-0421.2010.00275.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21091984/,359

It is urgent to evaluate the effect of reopening policies on the COVID-19 pandemic to help with the decision-making on the control measures and medical resource allocations. In this study, a novel SEIR model was developed to evaluate the effect of reopening policies based on the real-world reported COVID-19 data in Texas. The earlier reported data before the reopening were used to develop the SEIR model; data after the reopening were used for evaluation. The simulation results show that if continuing the “stay-at-home order” without reopening the business, the COVID-19 pandemic could end in December 2020 in Texas. On the other hand, the pandemic could be controlled similarly as the case of no-reopening only if the contact rate was low and additional high magnitude of control measures could be implemented. If the control measures are only slightly enhanced after reopening, it could flatten the curve of the COVID-19 epidemic with reduced numbers of infections and deaths, but it might make the epidemic last longer. Based on the reported data up to July 2020 in Texas, the real-world epidemic pattern is between the cases of the low and high magnitude of control measures with a medium risk of contact rate after reopening. In this case, the pandemic might last until summer 2021 to February 2022 with a total of 4–10 million infected cases and 20,080–58,604 deaths.","Yu, Duo; Zhu, Gen; Wang, Xueying; Zhang, Chenguang; Soltanalizadeh, Babak; Wang, Xia; Tang, Sanyi; Wu, Hulin",Infect Dis Model,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33644499/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468042721000166?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idm.2021.02.001; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468042721000166,359

The objective of this review was to discuss topical preparations that could be utilized preoperatively to help to decrease viral load and potentially reduce the risks of viral transmission. METHODS: A PubMed/MEDLINE database review of articles was performed querying topical preparations with virucidal activity against coronaviruses. RESULTS: Povidone‐iodine (PVP‐I) solutions ranging from 0.23% to 7% have been found to demonstrate highly effective virucidal activity against a broad range of viruses including several coronaviruses responsible for recent epidemics including SARS‐CoV‐1 and MERS‐CoV. CONCLUSIONS: While specific evidence regarding SARS‐CoV‐2 is lacking, PVP‐I‐based preparations have been successfully demonstrated to reduce viral loads of coronaviruses.

In this study, we undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the efficacy of integrated medicine therapy for patients with COVID-19. Methods: In this meta-analysis, we searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, SinoMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Chongqing VIP (CQVIP), and Wanfang databases from inception to April 12, 2021, to identify RCTs of integrated medicine in the treatment of COVID-19. The quality of RCTs was assessed by the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RevMan v5.3 and Stata software packages were used for statistical analysis. Results: Nineteen RCTs involving 1,853 patients met our inclusion criteria. Compared with patients treated by conventional Western medicine (CWM), patients treated by integrated medicine have a higher overall effective rate [RR = 1.17, 95% CI: (1.10, 1.26), p < 0.00001], fever disappearance rate [RR = 1.25, 95% CI: (1.04, 1.50), p = 0.02], fatigue disappearance rate [RR = 1.28, 95% CI: (1.00, 1.63), p = 0.05], and chest CT improvement rate [RR = 1.24, 95% CI: (1.14, 1.34), p < 00001]. Beneficial effects of the integrated medicine therapy were also seen in C-reactive protein (CRP) level [WMD = −4.14, 95% CI: (−6.38, −1.91), p = 0.0003] and white blood cell (WBC) count [WMD = 0.35, 95% CI: (0.11, 0.58), p = 0.004]. Subgroup analyses showed that, when the treatment time is <2 weeks, the effect of integrated medicine treatment is more obvious in improving the overall effective rate, clinical symptoms (fever, fatigue, and cough), the CRP level, and WBC count compared with that of the CWM treatment. For patients with severe and non-severe COVID-19, integrated medicine is more effective in improving fever and cough symptoms and WBC count than using CWM alone. Conclusion: The results of the current meta-analysis suggested that the integrated medicine can improve the clinical symptoms, chest CT and infection indicators of COVID-19 patients. Even if the treatment time is <2 weeks, the effect of integrated medicine in improving symptoms is more obvious compared with the treatment of CWM. However, the results should be interpreted cautiously due to the heterogeneity among the studies.","Yin, Bei; Bi, Yi-Ming; Sun, Lu; Huang, Jin-Zhu; Zhao, Jia; Yao, Jia; Li, An-Xiang; Wang, Xian-Zhe; Fan, Guan-Jie",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.622707; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34307269/,359
647292,Biosafety in the preparation and processing of cytology specimens with potential coronavirus (COVID‐19) infection: Perspectives from Taiwan,2020-04-07,"Abstract The unique glycoprotein of influenza C virus, designated hemagglutinin (HEF), exhibits three functions: hemagglutination, esterase activity, and fusion factor. As the virus uses 9-O-acetylated sialic acid as a high-affinity receptor determinant for attachment to cells, its binding activity was used to reveal O-acetylated sialic acid residues after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transfer onto nitrocellulose sheets of proteins and thin-layer chromatography of lipids. The specificity of the binding for O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates was investigated. Our results showed that influenza C virus could detect the different forms of the two murine glycophorins which are known to be O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates. The virus also bound to O-acetylated gangliosides isolated from embryonic chicken brain such as purified O-acetylated NeuAcα(2–8)NeuAcα(2–8)NeuAcα(2–3)Galβ(1–4)Glcβ(1-1)ceramide (GT3). The esterase activity of the HEF protein of influenza C virus was used to unmask the sialic acid. After its deacetylation by the virus enzyme, the O-acetylated GT3 was recognized by a monoclonal antibody which binds only to the nonacetylated derivative. The results presented here show that influenza C virus is a discriminating analytical probe for identifying O-acetylated sialoglycoconjugates directly after Western blotting of proteins and thin-layer chromatography of lipids, thus providing a new analytical tool.","Manuguerra, Jean-Claude; DuBois, Catherine; Hannoun, Claude",Analytical Biochemistry,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/000326979190252O; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/000326979190252O; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1713751/,359

Each component of the ABCDEF bundle is not sufficiently provided from 16% to 52% owing to the highly transmissible nature of the virus. However, new data are emerging about analgesia, sedation, delirium care, nursing care, early mobilization, nutrition, and family support. In this review, we summarize the recent data on PICS and its new challenge in PICS after COVID-19 infection.","Nakanishi, Nobuto; Liu, Keibun; Kawakami, Daisuke; Kawai, Yusuke; Morisawa, Tomoyuki; Nishida, Takeshi; Sumita, Hidenori; Unoki, Takeshi; Hifumi, Toru; Iida, Yuki; Katsukawa, Hajime; Nakamura, Kensuke; Ohshimo, Shinichiro; Hatakeyama, Junji; Inoue, Shigeaki; Nishida, Osamu",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501316/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm10173870,359

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and twenty-seven surgical charts of cataract patients who underwent phacoemulsification with IOL insertion between June 2018 and October 2020 were reviewed. There were 113 cases operated on under halogen-illuminated microscope (Carl Zeiss OPMI LUMERA S7(®)) and 114 cases operated on under light-emitting diode (LED)-illuminated microscope (Leica PROVEO 8(®)). All cases were operated on by the same surgeon (S.T.). The difference in operative time and ultrasound time between two groups was compared by independent samples t-test. The proportion of cases with 3-months BCVA that was better than 20/30 and the proportion of cases with intraoperative complications from the operation between two groups were compared by Pearson’s Chi-squared test. RESULTS: The mean ultrasound time was 121.29±53.60 seconds in halogen group and 123.98±61.53 seconds in LED group. The mean difference was −2.69±8.44 seconds which was not statistically significant (95% CI, −19.35 to 13.97; p=0.573). The mean operative time was 19.83±4.77 minutes in the halogen group and 17.20±3.02 minutes in the LED group. The mean difference was 2.63±0.53 minutes (95% CI, 1.59 to 3.67; p < 0.001). The cases with BCVA better than 20/30 was 93.69% in halogen group and 95.49% in LED group. The proportion of cases with intraoperative complications was 3.53% in halogen group and 2.63% in LED group. The difference of both proportions was not statistically significant (p=0.553 and p=0.692, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study shows statistically significant operative time reduction with LED microscope. This evidence could be used for making the decision to switch from halogen microscope to LED microscope. Upgrading to LED-illuminated microscope might be beneficial for productivity improvement if there were at least six to seven cases operated on per day. The ultrasound time, efficacy, and safety showed no significant difference.","Tangjanyatam, Sagol",Clin Ophthalmol,https://doi.org/10.2147/opth.s328450; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34511876/,359

At the height of the pandemic, there were 855 patients with COVID-19 admitted on April 13, 2020. Due to high demand for dialysis and shortages of staff and supplies, we started an urgent peritoneal dialysis (PD) program. From April 1(st) to April 22(nd), 30 patients were started on PD. Of those 30 patients, 14 died during their hospitalization, 8 were discharged, and 8 were still hospitalized as of May 14, 2020. Although the PD program was successful in its ability to provide much-needed kidney replacement therapy (KRT) when hemodialysis was not available, challenges to delivering adequate PD dosage included difficulties in providing nurse training and availability of supplies. Providing adequate clearance and ultrafiltration for patients in intensive care units was especially difficult due to high prevalence of hypercatabolic state, volume overload, and prone positioning. PD was more easily performed in non-critically ill patients outside the intensive care unit. Despite these challenges, we demonstrate that urgent PD is a feasible alternative to hemodialysis in situations with critical resource shortages.","Sourial, Maryanne Y.; Sourial, Mina H.; Dalsan, Rochelle; Graham, Jay; Ross, Michael; Chen, Wei; Golestaneh, Ladan",Am J Kidney Dis,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0272638620307356; https://doi.org/10.1053/j.ajkd.2020.06.001; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272638620307356?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32534129/,359

We have previously shown that the E protein from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) forms cation-selective ion channels in planar lipid bilayers (Wilson, L., McKinlay, C., Gage, P., Ewart, G., 2004. SARS coronavirus E protein forms cation-selective ion channels. Virology 330(1), 322–331). We now report that three other E proteins also form cation-selective ion channels. These E proteins were from coronaviruses representative of taxonomic groups 1–3: human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), respectively. It appears, therefore, that coronavirus E proteins in general, belong to the virus ion channels family. Hexamethylene amiloride (HMA) – an inhibitor of the HIV-1 Vpu virus ion channel – inhibited the HCoV-229E and MHV E protein ion channel conductance in bilayers and also inhibited replication of the parent coronaviruses in cultured cells, as determined by plaque assay. Conversely, HMA had no antiviral effect on a recombinant MHV with the entire coding region of E protein deleted (MHVΔE). Taken together, the data provide evidence of a link between inhibition of E protein ion channel activity and the antiviral activity of HMA.","Wilson, Lauren; Gage, Peter; Ewart, Gary",Virology,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004268220600359X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16815524/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004268220600359X,359

The age-standardized incidence of BC in Argentina is 73 per 100,000. Despite the availability of early detection services, 30% of BCs are diagnosed at advanced disease stages. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) of Argentina and the National Program for Control of Breast Cancer (NPCBC) focus on two main objectives: guaranteeing adequate and timely BC treatment and reducing BC mortality in Argentina. These objectives are addressed by maintaining three core concepts: quality control, disease monitoring, and wide coverage of available early detection and treatment services. The NPCBC is currently implementing the “Time 1 Survey Study.” Time 1 is defined as the time from the first appearance of BC signs or symptoms to the first consult within the public healthcare system. This timeframe is important in Argentina because it is outside of the health timeframes and data parameters monitored by the national cancer data registry system. The Time 1 Survey study has the potential to serve as an informational tool for BC patient navigation efforts in Argentina because it can be used to identify and characterize the barriers and delays that women face during Time 1. Lessons and experiences included in this study could be translated to other Latin American and middle-income countries for developing cancer control programs that can lead to improving treatment and reducing mortality through patient navigation and cancer education efforts for the public, health professionals, and patients.","Valencia, Dora; Granda, Paula; Pesce, Veronica; Di Sibio, Alejandro; Soliman, Amr S.; Gómez, Jorge; Ramos, Irma; Gallardo, Patricia",J Cancer Educ,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13187-021-02011-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33904121/,359

We investigate UK cardiac surgery outcomes during the early phase of the Covid-19 pandemic. METHODS: This retrospective observational study included all adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery between 1st March and 30th April 2020 in nine UK centres. Data was obtained and linked locally from the National Institute for Cardiovascular Outcomes Research Adult Cardiac Surgery database, the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre database and local electronic systems. The anonymised datasets were analysed by the lead centre. Statistical analysis included descriptive statistics, propensity score matching (PSM), conditional logistic regression and hierarchical quantile regression. RESULTS: Of 755 included individuals, 53 (7.0%) had Covid-19. Comparing those with and without Covid-19, those with Covid-19 had increased mortality (24.5% v 3.5%, p < 0.0001) and longer post-operative stay (11 days v 6 days, p = 0.001), both of which remained significant after PSM. Patients with a pre-operative Covid-19 diagnosis recovered in a similar way to non-Covid-19 patients. However, those with a post-operative Covid-19 diagnosis remained in hospital for an additional 5 days (12 days v 7 days, p = 0.024) and had a considerably higher mortality rate compared to those with a pre-operative diagnosis (37.1% v 0.0%, p = 0.005). CONCLUSIONS: To mitigate against the risks of Covid-19, particularly the post-operative burden, robust and effective pre-surgery diagnosis protocols alongside effective strategies to maintain a Covid-19 free environment are needed.

Here, to comprehensively map cell lineages, we use single-cell RNA sequencing and antigen receptor analysis of almost half a million cells from up to 5 anatomical regions in the developing and up to 11 distinct anatomical regions in the healthy paediatric and adult human gut. This reveals the existence of transcriptionally distinct BEST4 epithelial cells throughout the human intestinal tract. Furthermore, we implicate IgG sensing as a function of intestinal tuft cells. We describe neural cell populations in the developing enteric nervous system, and predict cell-type-specific expression of genes associated with Hirschsprung’s disease. Finally, using a systems approach, we identify key cell players that drive the formation of secondary lymphoid tissue in early human development. We show that these programs are adopted in inflammatory bowel disease to recruit and retain immune cells at the site of inflammation.

Low-pathogenic AIV (LPAIV) is naturally present in wild birds, and the introduction of the virus into domestic poultry is assumed to occur through contact with wild birds and by human activity, including the movement of live and dead poultry, and fomites such as clothing and vehicles. At present, the possible role of insects in the spread of AIV is dubious. The objective of the present work was to investigate the potential transmission of LPAIV by persistence of the virus in the alimentary tract of house flies, Musca domestica L. (Diptera: Muscidae). Flies were fed three virus concentrations of two AIV strains and then incubated at different temperatures for up to 24 h. The persistence of the two virus strains in the flies declined with increasing incubation temperatures and incubation periods. Similarly, increased virus uptake by the flies increased the persistence of virus. Persistence of infective AIV in flies differed significantly between the two virus strains. The laboratory experiments of the present study indicate that the house fly can be a potential carrier of AIV.","Nielsen, Anne Ahlmann; Skovgård, Henrik; Stockmarr, Anders; Handberg, Kurt Jensen; Jørgensen, Poul H.",J Med Entomol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21661322/,359

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood products were spiked with SARS‐CoV, CCHFV or NiV, and then treated with increasing doses of UVC light (THERAFLEX UV‐Platelets) or with methylene blue (MB) plus increasing doses of visible light (MB/light; THERAFLEX MB‐Plasma). Samples were taken before and after treatment with each illumination dose and tested for residual infectivity. RESULTS: Treatment with half to three‐fourths of the full UVC dose (0·2 J/cm(2)) reduced the infectivity of SARS‐CoV (≥3·4 log), CCHFV (≥2·2 log) and NiV (≥4·3 log) to the limit of detection (LOD) in platelet concentrates, and treatment with MB and a fourth of the full light dose (120 J/cm(2)) decreased that of SARS‐CoV (≥3·1 log), CCHFV (≥3·2 log) and NiV (≥2·7 log) to the LOD in plasma.

Using an activity-guided biochemical approach, we report the molecular identification of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) as a second intracellular N-acyl amino acid synthase/hydrolase. In vitro, FAAH exhibits a more restricted substrate scope compared to PM20D1. In mice, genetic ablation or selective pharmacological inhibition of FAAH bidirectionally dysregulates intracellular, but not circulating, N-acyl amino acids. Dual blockade of both PM20D1 and FAAH reveals a dramatic and non-additive biochemical engagement of these two enzymatic pathways. These data establish FAAH as a second intracellular pathway for N-acyl amino acid metabolism and underscore enzymatic division of labor as an enabling strategy for the regulation of a structurally diverse bioactive lipid family.","Kim, Joon T; Terrell, Stephanie M; Li, Veronica L; Wei, Wei; Fischer, Curt R; Long, Jonathan Z",eLife,https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.55211; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32271712/,359

These centers have developed strategic practices to provide multidisciplinary comprehensive care, but their best practices have not yet been well studied as a group. METHODS: A qualitative survey was conducted by telephone/email from October 2019 to February 2020 among eligible healthcare providers with experience in the management of ATTR-CM at US amyloidosis centers, patients with ATTR-CM treated at amyloidosis centers, and patient advocates from amyloidosis patient support groups. RESULTS: Fifteen cardiologists and 9 nurse practitioners/nurses from 15 selected amyloidosis centers participated in the survey, with 16 patients and 4 patient advocates. Among participating healthcare providers, the most frequently cited center best practices were diagnostic capability, multidisciplinary care, and time spent on patient care; the greatest challenges involved coordination of patient care. Patients described the “ideal” amyloidosis program as one that provides physicians with expertise in ATTR-CM, sufficient time with patients, comprehensive patient care, and opportunities to participate in research/clinical trials. The majority of centers host patient support group meetings, and patient advocacy groups provide support for centers with physician/patient education and research. CONCLUSIONS: Amyloidosis centers offer comprehensive care based on staff expertise in ATTR-CM, a multidisciplinary approach, advanced diagnostics, and time dedicated to patient care and education. Raising awareness of amyloidosis centers’ best practices among healthcare providers can reinforce the benefits of early referral and comprehensive care for patients with ATTR-CM.","Nativi-Nicolau, Jose; Sarswat, Nitasha; Fajardo, Johana; Finkel, Muriel; Abdulsattar, Younos; Castaño, Adam; Klein, Lori; Haddad-Angulo, Alexandra",Clin Med Insights Cardiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34104028/; https://doi.org/10.1177/11795468211015230,359

Coronaviruses (CoVs), including HCoV-OC43, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, are the causative agents of respiratory virus infections that range in severity from the common cold to severe pneumonia. There are currently no effective treatments for coronavirus-associated diseases. In this report, we examined the anti-viral impact of kurarinone against infection with the human coronavirus, HCoV-OC43. We found that kurarinone inhibited HCoV-OC43 infection in human lung fibroblast MRC-5 cells in a dose-dependent manner with an IC(50) of 3.458 ± 0.101 µM. Kurarinone inhibited the virus-induced cytopathic effect, as well as extracellular and intracellular viral RNA and viral protein expression. Time-of-addition experiments suggested that kurarinone acted at an early stage of virus infection. Finally, we found that HCoV-OC43 infection increased the autophagic flux in MRC-5 cells; kurarinone inhibited viral replication via its capacity to impair the virus-induced autophagic flux. As such, we suggest that kurarinone may be a useful therapeutic for the treatment of diseases associated with coronavirus infection.","Min, Jung Sun; Kim, Dong Eon; Jin, Young-Hee; Kwon, Sunoh",J Clin Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32674356/; https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm9072230,359

We identified 10 mutation hot spots (trnK-rps16, atpH-atpI, psaA-ycf3, ndhC-trnV, ndhF, rpl32-trnL, ndhG-ndhI, rps15-ycf1, ycf1a, and ycf1b) as candidate DNA barcodes for Salvia. Additionally, we observed the transfer of nine large-sized chloroplast genome fragments, with a total size of 49,895 bp (accounting for 32.97% of the chloroplast genome), into the mitochondrial genome as they shared >97% sequence similarity. Phylogenetic analyses of the whole chloroplast genome provided a high resolution of Salvia. This study will pave the way for the identification and breeding of Salvia medicinal plants and further phylogenetic evolutionary research on them as well.","Gao, Chengwen; Wu, Chuanhong; Zhang, Qian; Zhao, Xia; Wu, Mingxuan; Chen, Ruirui; Zhao, Yalin; Li, Zhiqiang",Front Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33193683/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2020.574962,359

We carried out a retrospective observational study of 169 patients, 96 (58.9%) of whom had a high viral load and the remaining had a low viral load. Compared with patients with a low viral load, patients with a high viral load did not exhibit differences regarding preexisting cardiovascular risk factors or comorbidities. There were no differences in symptoms, vital signs, or laboratory tests in either group, except for the maximum cardiac troponin I (cTnI), which was higher in the group with a higher viral load (24 [interquartile range 9.5–58.5] versus 8.5 [interquartile range 3–22.5] ng/L, P = 0.007). There were no differences in the need for hospital admission, admission to the intensive care unit, or the need for mechanical ventilation in clinical management. In-hospital mortality was greater in patients who had a higher viral load than in those with low viral load (24% versus 10.4%, P = 0.029). High viral loads were associated with in-hospital mortality in the binary logistic regression analysis (odds ratio: 2.701, 95% Charlson Index (CI): 1.084–6.725, P = 0.033). However, in an analysis adjusted for age, gender, CI, and cTnI, viral load was no longer a predictor of mortality. In conclusion, an elevated nasopharyngeal viral load was not a determinant of in-hospital mortality in patients with COVID-19, as much as age, comorbidity, and myocardial damage determined by elevated cTnI are.","Carrasquer, Anna; Peiró, Óscar M.; Sanchez-Gimenez, Raul; Lal-Trehan, Nisha; del-Moral-Ronda, Victor; Bonet, Gil; Gutierrez, Cristina; Fort-Gallifa, Isabel; Martin-Grau, Carla; Benavent, Clara; Vidal, Francesc; Bardají, Alfredo",Am J Trop Med Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33357280/; https://doi.org/10.4269/ajtmh.20-1427,359
653268,2020 international practice patterns in adult joint reconstruction surgery: a survey of members of the International Society of Orthopaedic Centers,2021-01-22,"Abstract Asthma is an inflammatory disorder of the airways involving coordinate up-regulation of TH2-type cytokines encoded in a cluster on chromosome 5q31-33 on T cells and inflammatory cells. There is also a requirement for local airway susceptibility factors that, together with TH2 polarization, results in hyperresponsiveness, variable airflow obstruction, and, over time, remodeling of the airway wall. Asthma has strong genetic and environmental components that interact both in the induction and subsequent expression of the disease phenotypes. Multiple genes are involved and probably interact. Whole genome screens are beginning to identify gene-rich regions of special relevance to asthma and atopy, although a novel disease-related gene has yet to be discovered from these. By contrast, there are a plethora of candidate genes whose function in relation to disease pathophysiologic mechanisms and response to treatment are known. Two examples are polymorphisms involving IL-4 receptors and the enzymes controlling cysteinyl leukotriene production. Abnormal signaling between the epithelium, which is in contact with the environment, and the underlying (myo)fibroblasts and dendritic cells indicating reactivation of the epithelial mesenchymal trophic unit, which is involved in fetal lung development and branching, provide a basis for asthma that encapsulates both TH2 polarization and airway wall remodeling.

653895,The clinical practice of Pediatric Dentistry post-COVID-19: the current evidences,2021-01-26,"Background: Health systems worldwide have faced major disruptions due to COVID-19 which could exacerbate health inequalities. The UK National Health Service (NHS) provides free healthcare and prioritises equity of delivery, but the pandemic may be hindering the achievement of these goals. We investigated associations between multiple social characteristics (sex, age, occupational social class, education and ethnicity) and self-reported healthcare disruptions in over 65,000 participants across twelve UK longitudinal studies. Methods: Participants reported disruptions from March 2020 up to late January 2021. Associations between social characteristics and three types of self-reported healthcare disruption (medication access, procedures, appointments) and a composite of any of these were assessed in logistic regression models, adjusting for age, sex and ethnicity where relevant. Random-effects meta-analysis was conducted to obtain pooled estimates. Results: Prevalence of disruption varied across studies; between 6.4% (TwinsUK) and 31.8 % (Understanding Society) of study participants reported any disruption. Females (Odd Ratio (OR): 1.27 [95%CI: 1.15,1.40]; I2=53%), older persons (e.g. OR: 1.39 [1.13,1.72]; I2=77% for 65-75y vs 45-54y), and Ethnic minorities (excluding White minorities) (OR: 1.19 [1.05,1.35]; I2=0% vs White) were more likely to report healthcare disruptions. Those in a more disadvantaged social class (e.g. OR: 1.17 [1.08, 1.27]; I2=0% for manual/routine vs managerial/professional) were also more likely to report healthcare disruptions, but no clear differences were observed by education levels. Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unequal healthcare disruptions, which, if unaddressed, could contribute to the maintenance or widening of existing health inequalities.","Maddock, J.; Parsons, S.; Di Gessa, G.; Green, M.

The current study aimed to address this gap. METHODS: Three hundred and four Saudi patients in Jazan Region, Saudi Arabia, who died after being hospitalized with COVID-19 between July 1, 2020, and December 31, 2020, were analyzed in this retrospective cohort study. RESULTS: A greater proportion of male patients (59%), compared to female patients (41%), died due to COVID-19. Just over half (55%) of the deaths due to COVID-19 affected patients aged ≥65 years. More than two-thirds of the deceased COVID-19 patients had diabetes (70%) and hypertension (69%); other comorbidities were obesity (30%), heart disease (30%), and chronic kidney disease (14%). Dyspnea (91%), cough (80%), and fever (70%) were the most frequently reported clinical symptoms. Eighty-five per cent of COVID-19 deaths occurred in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and 90% of the patients required mechanical ventilation. Typically, lymphopenia, and neutrophilia were observed on admission and 24 hours prior to death. Creatinine and serum ferritin levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate and D-dimer plasma levels increased significantly following infection with COVID-19. Lung infiltrates and pulmonary opacity (83%) were the most common findings on chest X-ray. Respiratory failure (70%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (52%) were the leading complications to death. Logistic and Cox regression revealed that a higher age, smoking, high creatinine and aspartate transaminase levels, and respiratory failure were significantly associated with the risk of mortality during the early stay in hospitals. CONCLUSION: The proportion of comorbidities was high in deceased patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 in Jazan region, Saudi Arabia. A higher age, smoking, and respiratory failure were significant predictors of mortality during the early stay in hospitals.","Badedi, Mohammed; Darraj, Hussain; Alnami, Awaji Qasem; Makrami, Ali; Mahfouz, Mohamed Salih; Alhazmi, Khalid; Mahmoud, Nahid; Mosa, Halimh",Int J Gen Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34335047/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s320713,359

During the pandemic, with hospital reorganization, clinical and learning activities performed by residents suffered a forced remodulation. The objective of this study is to investigate how urology training in Italy has been affected during the COVID-19 era. In this multi-academic study, we compared residents' training during the highest outbreak level with their previous activity. Overall 387 (67.1%) of the 577 Italian Urology residents participated in a 72-h anonymous online survey with 36 items sent via email. The main outcomes were clinical/surgical activities, social distancing, distance learning, and telemedicine. Clinical and learning activity was significantly reduced for the overall group, and after categorizing residents as those working only in COVID hospitals, both “junior” and “senior” residents, and those working in any of three geographical areas created (Italian regions were clustered in three major zones according to the prevalence of COVID-19). A significant decrease in outpatient activity, invasive diagnostic procedures, and endoscopic and major surgeries was reported. Through multivariate analysis, the specific year of residency has been found to be an independent predictor for all response modification. Being in zone 3 and zone 2 and having “senior” resident status were independent predictors associated with a lower reduction of the clinical and learning activity. Working in a COVID hospital and having “senior” resident status were independent predictors associated with higher reduction of the outpatient activity. Working in zone 3 and having “senior” resident status were independent predictors of lower and higher outpatient surgical activity, respectively. Working in a COVID hospital was an independent predictor associated with robotic surgical activity. The majority of residents reported that distance teaching and multidisciplinary virtual meetings are still not used, and 44.8% reported that their relationships with colleagues decreased. The COVID-19 pandemic presents an unprecedented challenge, including changes in the training and education of urology residents. The COVID era can offer an opportunity to balance and implement innovative solutions that can bridge the educational gap and can be part of future urology training.","Busetto, Gian Maria; Del Giudice, Francesco; Mari, Andrea; Sperduti, Isabella; Longo, Nicola; Antonelli, Alessandro; Cerruto, Maria Angela; Costantini, Elisabetta; Carini, Marco; Minervini, Andrea; Rocco, Bernardo; Artibani, Walter; Porreca, Angelo; Porpiglia, Francesco; Damiano, Rocco; De Sio, Marco; Arcaniolo, Davide; Cimino, Sebastiano; Russo, Giorgio Ivan; Lucarelli, Giuseppe; Di Tonno, Pasquale; Gontero, Paolo; Soria, Francesco; Trombetta, Carlo; Liguori, Giovanni; Scarpa, Roberto Mario; Papalia, Rocco; Terrone, Carlo; Borghesi, Marco; Verze, Paolo; Madonia, Massimo; De Lisa, Antonello; Bove, Pierluigi; Guazzoni, Giorgio; Lughezzani, Giovanni; Racioppi, Marco; Di Gianfrancesco, Luca; Brunocilla, Eugenio; Schiavina, Riccardo; Simeone, Claudio; Veccia, Alessandro; Montorsi, Francesco; Briganti, Alberto; Dal Moro, Fabrizio; Pavone, Carlo; Serretta, Vincenzo; Di Stasi, Savino Mauro; Galosi, Andrea Benedetto; Schips, Luigi; Marchioni, Michele; Montanari, Emanuele; Carrieri, Giuseppe; Cormio, Luigi; Greco, Francesco; Musi, Gennaro; Maggi, Martina; Conti, Simon L.; Tubaro, Andrea; De Berardinis, Ettore; Sciarra, Alessandro; Gallucci, Michele; Mirone, Vincenzo; de Cobelli, Ottavio; Ferro, Matteo",Front Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33330604/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fsurg.2020.563006,359

Because of different treatment options for the parasites, confirmation of presence of one or both pathogens is necessary. The PCR based assays are suitable for differential diagnosis. We evaluated the performance of Small Animal Diarrhoea panel, a multiplexed-tandem real-time PCR (MT-PCR) assay, that detects DNA of both G. intestinalis and T. foetus. The sensitivity and specificity were compared to reference real-time PCR assays using 105 faecal samples, 39.05% (n = 41) positive for G. intestinalis and 30.48% (n = 32) were positive for T. foetus. The faecal samples positive for T. foetus had a high proportion of late amplifiers, determined by an arbitrary threshold of C(t)-values > 35. On the other hand, only one G. intestinalis positive sample was considered a late amplifier. For G. intestinalis DNA, the MT-PCR assay had 95.1% sensitivity and 92.1% specificity. For T. foetus DNA, the MT-PCR assay had 41.9% sensitivity and 100.0% specificity. To evaluate the interlaboratory reproducibility of the MT-PCR assay, results were compared in two different laboratories and found to be in a very good agreement (Kappa = 0.9). Further analysis of the DNA using conventional PCR determined presence of G. intestinalis Assemblage F and T. foetus genotype ‘feline’. In conclusion, the MT-PCR Small Animal Diarrhoea panel had a good and poor performance against reference assays for G. intestinalis and T. foetus, respectively. The assay is suitable for detection and differential diagnosis of G. intestinalis and moderate to high burdens of T. foetus in small animal clinical practice.","Meggiolaro, Maira N.; Roeber, Florian; Kobylski, Victoria; Higgins, Damien P.; Šlapeta, Jan",Vet Parasitol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304401719300019; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetpar.2018.12.009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30736943/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304401719300019,359

Methods: Between April 21 and 27, a cross-sectional epidemiologic study targeting the full population of Ischgl (n= 1867), of which 79% could be included (n=1473, incl. 214 children), was performed. For each individual, the study involved a SARS-CoV-2 PCR, antibody testing and structured questionnaires. A mathematical model was used to help understand the influence of the determined seroprevalence on virus transmission. Findings: The seroprevalence was 42.4% (95% CI 39.8-44.7). Individuals under 18 showed a significantly lower seroprevalence of 27.1% (95% CI 21.3-33.6) than adults (45%; 95% CI 42.2-47.7; OR of 0.455, 95% CI 0.356-0.682, p<0.001). Of the seropositive individuals, 83.7% had not been diagnosed to have had SARS-CoV-2 infection previously. The clinical course was generally mild. Over the previous two months, two COVID-19-related deaths had been recorded, corresponding to an infection fatality rate (IFR) of 0.25% (95% CI 0.03-0.91). Only 8 (0.5 %) individuals were newly diagnosed to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 during this study. Interpretation: Ischgl was hit early and hard by SARS-CoV-2 leading to a high local seroprevalence of 42.4%, which was lower in individuals below the age of 18 than in adults. Mathematical modeling suggests that a drastic decline of newly infected individuals in Ischgl by the end of April occured due to the dual impact from the non-pharmacological interventions (NPIs) and a significant immunization of the Ischgl population.

This paper evaluates the in-sample and out-of-sample stock return predictive power of the global and Saudi geopolitical risk indices and crude oil returns in the context of six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Monthly data from February 2007 to December 2019 and the feasible generalized least square (FGLS) estimator for predictive modelling by Westerlund and Narayan (2012, 2015) are used. Global and Saudi GPR indices show weak evidence of in-sample predictability of excess stock returns. However, the out-of-sample forecasts show that only the global geopolitical risk index provides superior prediction in the context of Kuwaiti and Omani stock markets, compared to the historical average benchmark model. Crude oil prices are shown to be a better predictor in most cases, in both in-sample and out-of-sample forecast models The results imply that crude oil returns can be used for active prediction of GCC stock market returns, once econometric issues are accounted for.

This study aims to identify the suicide-related risk factors and stressors to determine the groups at a greater risk of attempting suicide during the COVID-19 lockdown. METHODS: This retrospective study examined 29 cases of attempted suicide during the 3-month COVID-19 lockdown in KSA. The suicide risk factors were evaluated using the modified sex, age, depression, previous attempt, excess alcohol, rational thinking loss, social support lacking, organized plan, no spouse, sickness (SAD PERSONS) scale along with a comprehensive assessment of the recent stressful life events. RESULTS: The lockdown stressors that may have triggered suicidal behaviours were identified as follows: psychological distress, relationship problems, financial difficulties, and extreme fear of the COVID-19 infection. While all age groups carried the risk of attempting suicide during the lockdown, patients with psychiatric disorders and women accounted for 69% and 65.5% of the cohort, respectively. Factors including hopelessness and depression were highly related to suicide attempts. The statement of future intent to repeat the attempt was made by 72.4% and 65.5%, respectively. Almost two-thirds of the attempts made were serious, and many women felt unsafe in their own homes during the lockdown. CONCLUSION: Patients with pre-existing psychiatric disorders and women carry high risk of attempting suicide during the COVID-19 lockdown.

656775,Air Should Not be There: A Case of Pneumomediastinum and Pneumopericardium in COVID-19,2020-11-25,"Papain-like protease (nsp-3; non-structural protein) of novel corona virus is an ideal target for developing drugs as it plays multiple important functions for viral growth and replication. For instance, role of nsp-3 has been recognized in cleavage of viral polyprotein; furthermore, in infected host it weakens the immune system via downregulating the production of type I interferon. This downregulation is promoted by removal of ubiquitin-like interferon-stimulated gene 15 protein (ISG15) from interferon-responsive factor 3 (IRF3) protein. Among known inhibitors of SARS-CoV-PLpro GRL0617 is by far the most effective inhibitor. As PLpro of SARS-CoV2 is having more than 80% similarity with SARS-CoV-PLpro, GRL0617 is reported to be effective even against SARS-CoV2. Owing to this similarity, certain key amino acids remain the same/conserved in both proteins. Among conserved amino acids Tyr268 for SARS-CoV2 and Tyr269 for SARS-CoV produce important hydrophobic interactions with aromatic rings of GRL0617. Here, in this study antibacterial compounds were collected from ZINC database, and they were filtered to select compounds that are having similar structural features as GRL0617. This filtered library of compound was then docked with SARS-CoV and CoV2-PLpro. Five hits were noted that were able to interact with Tyr268 (SARS-CoV2) and Tyr269 (SARS-CoV).

656961,Affected olfaction in COVID-19: Re-defining “asymptomatic”,2020-11-19,"Dengue virus (DV) infection depends on a step of membrane fusion, which occurs in the acidic environment of the endosome. This process is mediated by virus surface envelope glycoprotein, in which the loop between residues D98–G112 is considered to be crucial, acting as a fusion peptide. Here, we have characterized functionally and structurally the interaction between the DV fusion peptide and different model membranes by fluorescence and NMR. Its interaction was strongest in dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles and anionic phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylglycerol vesicles, the only vesicle that was fused by DV fusion peptide. The three-dimensional structure of DV fusion peptide bound to DPC micelles was solved by solution homonuclear NMR with an r.m.s.d. of 0.98 Å. The most striking result obtained from the solution structure was the hydrophobic triad formed by residues W101, L107, and F108, pointing toward the same direction, keeping the segment between G102 and G106 in a loop conformation. The interaction of DV fusion peptide with phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylglycerol vesicles was also mapped by transfer-nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) experiments, in which the majority of the NOE cross-peaks were from the hydrophobic triad, corroborating the DPC-bound structure. Substitution of the residue W101 by an alanine residue completely abolished membrane binding and, thus, fusion by the peptide and its NOE cross-peaks. In conclusion, the 15-residue DV fusion peptide has intrinsic ability to promote membrane fusion, most likely due to the hydrophobic interaction among the residues W101, L107, and F108, which maintains its loop in the correct spatial conformation.","Melo, Manuel Nuno; Sousa, Francisco J.R.; Carneiro, Fabiana A.; Castanho, Miguel A.R.B.; Valente, Ana Paula; Almeida, Fabio C.L.; Da Poian, Andrea T.; Mohana-Borges, Ronaldo",J Mol Biol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0022283609008742; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283609008742; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19619560/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmb.2009.07.035,359

This evaluative study used data from the Brazilian National Program to Improve Acess and Quality in Primary Care (PMAQ-AB), collected in 2018. The study excluded teams that reported not performing this type of care. The sum of the 13 selected mental health indicators produced a score that was classified in three groups of quality: G1 (0 to 5 points - lower quality), G2 (6 to 9 points - medium quality), and G3 (10 to 13 points - higher quality), and the results were associated with nine organizational context variables favoring the teams' permanence in the respective quality groups. The study evaluated 36,384 teams, located in 5,026 municipalities (counties). The score ranged from 1 to 13 points (G1 = 9.7%; G2 = 25.1%; G3 = 65.2%).

657050,What is the role of rheumatologists in the era of COVID-19?,2020-04-03,"Bats are natural reservoirs for a variety of emerging viruses that cause significant disease in humans and domestic animals yet rarely cause clinical disease in bats. The co-evolutionary history of bats with viruses has been hypothesized to have shaped the bat-virus relationship, allowing both to exist in equilibrium. Progress in understanding bat-virus interactions and the isolation of bat-borne viruses has been accelerated in recent years by the development of susceptible bat cell lines. Viral sequences similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) have been detected in bats, and filoviruses such as Marburg virus have been isolated from bats, providing definitive evidence for the role of bats as the natural host reservoir. Although viruses can be readily detected in bats using molecular approaches, virus isolation is far more challenging. One of the limitations in using traditional culture systems from non-reservoir species is that cell types and culture conditions may not be compatible for isolation of bat-borne viruses. There is, therefore, a need to develop additional bat cell lines that correspond to different cell types, including less represented cell types such as immune cells, and culture them under more physiologically relevant conditions to study virus host interactions and for virus isolation. In this review, we highlight the current progress in understanding bat-virus interactions in bat cell line systems and some of the challenges and limitations associated with cell lines. Future directions to address some of these challenges to better understand host-pathogen interactions in these intriguing mammals are also discussed, not only in relation to viruses but also other pathogens carried by bats including bacteria and fungi.","Banerjee, Arinjay; Misra, Vikram; Schountz, Tony; Baker, Michelle L.",Virus Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2018.02.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29454637/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170217308201; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170217308201,359
657606,Cell-Based Therapies for COVID-19: Proper Clinical Investigations are Essential,2020-04-17,"BACKGROUND: It is unknown whether a positive serology result correlates with protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2. There are also concerns regarding the low positive predictive value of SARS-CoV-2 serology tests, especially when testing populations with low disease prevalence. METHODS: A neutralization assay was validated in a set of PCR confirmed positive specimens and in a negative cohort. In addition, 9,530 specimens were screened using the Diazyme SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology assay and all positive results (N = 164 individuals) were reanalyzed using the neutralization assay, the Roche total immunoglobin assay, and the Abbott IgG assay. The relationship between the magnitude of a positive SARS-CoV-2 serology result and neutralizing activity was determined. Neutralizing antibody titers (ID50) were also longitudinally monitored in SARS-CoV-2 PCR confirmed patients. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assay had a positive percent agreement (PPA) of 96.6% with a SARS-CoV-2 PCR test and a negative percent agreement (NPA) of 98.0% across 100 negative control individuals. ID50 neutralization titers positively correlated with all three clinical serology platforms. Longitudinal monitoring of hospitalized PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients demonstrated they made high neutralization titers against SARS-CoV-2. PPA between the Diazyme IgG assay alone and the neutralization assay was 50.6%, while combining the Diazyme IgG assay with either the Roche or Abbott platforms increased the PPA to 79.2% and 78.4%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These three clinical serology assays positively correlate with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization activity observed in COVID-19 patients. All SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patients develop neutralizing antibodies.","Suhandynata, Raymond T; Hoffman, Melissa A; Huang, Deli; Tran, Jenny T; Kelner, Michael J; Reed, Sharon L; McLawhon, Ronald W; Voss, James E; Nemazee, David; Fitzgerald, Robert L",Clin Chem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084854/; https://doi.org/10.1093/clinchem/hvaa262,359

We aimed to study headache character in relation to COVID-19. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study. Patients who had Coronavirus disease-19, confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction technique and presented to the headache clinic within 3 months after the onset of infections were identified to the study. Study included patients diagnosed as primary headache disorders according to The International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition. Participants were grouped into categories according to having previous or de novo headache. Descriptive data, paired sample t-test and the chi-squared test (X(2)) were used for statistical analyses of the data. RESULTS: A total of 121 patients were included in this study. Their mean age was 35.29 + 9.54 and most of them were females (83.5%). Prior to Coronavirus disease-19 infections, 78 (64.5%) had migraine and 11(9.1%) experienced a tension-type headache while 32 (26.4) reported de novo headache post Coronavirus disease-19. Patient had significant increase in headache days 11.09 ± 8.45 post Coronavirus disease-19 compared with 8.66 ± 7.49 headache days before Coronavirus disease-19 infection (p < 0.006). Post Coronavirus disease-19, the usage of analgesic increased significantly by the patient with migraine (2.31 ± 1.65 vs 3.05 ± 2.09, p = 0.002) while the patient with tension type headache had statistically significant increase in severity (5.556 ± 1.86 vs 7 ± 2.25, p = 0.033) and frequency (7 ± 6.29 vs 12.72 ± 7.96, p = 0.006) of headache attacks. Bi-frontal and temporal headache are the most reported (40.6% each) headache site among de novo headache group. Patients younger than 40 years had longer duration of the headache attack (18.50 ± 16.44 vs 5.5 ± 9.07, p = 0.045) post COVID-19. Male patients compared to females (8.66 ± 1.15 versus 5.93 ± 2.01 p = 0.04) had more severe headache post Coronavirus disease-19. De novo headache resolved within 1 month in most of patients (65.3%). CONCLUSION: Primary headache get worse after Coronavirus disease-19. De novo primary headache is frequent post Coronavirus disease-19 and resolve within 1 month. Headaches related to Coronavirus disease-19 are severe, present as migraine phenotype. Young male patients with Coronavirus disease-19 tend to have worse headache.","Al-Hashel, Jasem Youssef; Abokalawa, Fathi; Alenzi, Maram; Alroughani, Raed; Ahmed, Samar Farouk",J Headache Pain,https://doi.org/10.1186/s10194-021-01314-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34418950/,359

PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in Istanbul, Turkey, between March and June 2020, where a total of 4,700 persons were approached and 3,672 (78%) of participants (64.4% males and 35.6% females) completed the Knowledge Attitude Practices (KAP) and Fatigue Assessment Scale (FAS) questionnaires. RESULTS: In this study, 64.1% of participants were categorized as psychologically fatigued and 35.9% as normal. There was a significant difference between fatigued and normal participants with respect to age, educational level, occupational status, place of residence and number of family members (p < .001). Other differences related to knowledge of COVID-19 were symptoms, treatment, ways of spreading (p < .001), prevention by avoiding crowded places (p = .008) and isolation (p = .002). For attitudinal items, normal participants generally showed more positive attitudes than the fatigued in believing that COVID-19 will finally be controlled, satisfaction with preventive measures taken by the authorities, reporting suspected cases with symptoms and trusting that Turkey can overcome the COVID-19 pandemic (p < .001). Multivariate stepwise regression analysis indicated that level of education, avoiding going to crowded places, eye, nose and mouth organs are sensitive organs to the virus, keeping physical distance due to epidemic affect by COVID-19 virus, isolation and treatment of people reduce the spread of COVID-19 virus and 14-days period of time, COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with the respiratory droplets of an infected person, occupational status, health education programme needed and antibody treatment variables were significantly associated with fatigue after adjusting for age, gender and income variables.

The aim of this research is to answer a key question: in a social crisis, what motivates Americans to help others? Guided by research on appraisal theories and ecosystem theory, we examined the role of compassionate goals and prosocial emotions in promoting prosocial behaviours towards either out‐group or in‐group members. Study 1 (N = 943) was conducted in February 2020, before the widespread transmission of COVID‐19 began in the United States. Results show that people with high compassionate goals are more likely to experience sympathy, which in turn makes them more willing to help people suffering from COVID‐19 in China. Study 2 (N = 1,009) was conducted with a nationally representative sample after COVID‐19 became more prevalent in the United States. Although people with high compassionate goals still experience more sympathy and solidarity, sympathy does not predict donation intention. Instead, solidarity mediates the relationship between compassionate goals and donation intention.

The purpose of our study was to identify differences in the clinical characteristics and the in-hospital mortality of patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 internationally. METHODS: A comprehensive search of all published literature on adult patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 that reported on the clinical characteristics and in-hospital mortality was performed. Groups were compared using a Chi-square test with Yates correction of continuity. A two-tailed p value of less than 0.05 was considered as statistically significant. RESULTS: After screening 516 studies across the globe, 43 studies from 12 countries were included in our final analysis. Patients with COVID-19 in America and Europe were older compared to their Asian counterparts. Europe had the highest percentage of male patients. American and European patients had a higher incidence of co-morbid conditions (p < 0.05 for all variables). In-hospital mortality was significantly higher in America (22.23%) and Europe (22.9%) compared to Asia (12.65%) (p < 0.0001), but no difference was seen when compared with each other (p = 0.49).

659328,P082 Virtual undergraduate rheumatology teaching: a viable alternative approach during the COVID-19 pandemic?,2021-04-26,"The five boroughs of New York City (NYC) were early epicenters of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States, with over 380,000 cases by May 31. High caseloads were also seen in nearby counties in New Jersey (NJ), Connecticut (CT) and New York (NY). The pandemic started in the area in March with an exponential rise in the number of daily cases, peaked in early April, briefly declined, and then, showed clear signs of a second peak in several counties. We will show that despite control measures such as lockdown and restriction of movement during the exponential rise in daily cases, there was a significant net migration of households from NYC boroughs to the neighboring counties in NJ, CT and NY State. We propose that the second peak in daily cases in these counties around NYC was due, in part, to the movement of people from NYC boroughs to these counties. We estimate the movement of people using “Change of Address” (CoA) data from the US Postal Service, provided under the “Freedom of Information Act” of 1967. To identify the timing of the second peak and the number of cases in it, we use a previously proposed SIR model, which accurately describes the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic in European countries. Subtracting the model fits from the data identified, we establish the timing and the number of cases, N(CS), in the second peak. We then related the number of cases in the second peak to the county population density, P, and the excess Change of Address, E(CoA,) into each county using the simple model [Formula: see text] which fits the data very well with α = 0.68, β = 0.31 (R(2) = 0.74, p = 1.3e-8). We also find that the time between the first and second peaks was proportional to the distance of the county seat from NY Penn Station, suggesting that this migration of households and disease was a directed flow and not a diffusion process. Our analysis provides a simple method to use change of address data to track the spread of an infectious agent, such as SARS-Cov-2, due to migrations away from epicenters during the initial stages of a pandemic.","Schulman, Adam; Bhanot, Gyan",medRxiv,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.29.21254583v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.29.21254583; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33821284/,359

But what are the effects of the quarantine imposed by the states that implemented the measures of lockdown? The present research aims to explore, in a preliminary way, the major stress-related symptoms during the lockdown, due to Covid-19, in the Italian population. Subjects were asked to fill out a survey, that traced a line identifying the most relevant psychophysiological symptoms that took into account factors such as perceived stress, body perception, perceived pain, quality of sleep, perceptive variations (i.e., olfactory, gustatory, visual, acoustic, and haptic perception). A network approach formulating a hypothesis-generating exploratory analysis was adopted. Main results of the network analysis showed that the beliefs of having had the Covid-19 was related to individual variables (i.e., gender, working in presence, sleep quality, anxiety symptoms), while the familiarity of Covid-19 disease was related to contextual factors (e.g., number of recorded cases in the Region, working in presence). The self-perception of olfactory and perceptive alterations highlighted a great sensorial cross-modality, additionally, the olfactory impairment was related to the belief of having had the Covid-19. Compared to general network data, BAI, perceived stress, anxiety and chronic pain were in relation to daily sleep disturbance.

It provides a description of key epidemiologic events and news released from a prime daily newspaper and main Emergency Risk Communication (ERC) actions that were undertaken by public health authorities. Using the Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) theoretical framework, the study analyzes how the performed ERC strategies during the first days of the outbreak might have contributed to the outbreak management. Methods: MERS-CoV related events were chronologically tracked, together with the relevant stories that were published in a major newspaper over the course of three distinct phases of the epidemic. The collected media stories were then assessed against the practiced emergency risk communication (ERC) activities during the same time frame. Results: The Crisis & Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) framework was partially followed during the early days of the MERS-CoV epidemic, which were characterized by overwhelming uncertainty. The SCH’s commitment to a proactive and open risk communication strategy since day one, contributed to creating the SCH’s image as a credible source of information and allowed for the quick initiation of the overall response efforts. Yet, conflicting messages and over reassurance were among the observed pitfalls of the implemented ERC strategy. Conclusion: The adoption of CERC principles can help restore and maintain the credibility of responding agencies. Further work is needed to develop more rigorous and comprehensive research strategies that address sharing of information by mainstream as well as social media for a more accurate assessment of the impact of the ERC strategy.","Nour, Mohamed; Alhajri, Mohd; Farag, Elmoubasher A.

We have summarized in detail the management strategies implemented by the Chinese governments during the outbreaks. By considering three scenarios for the outbreak development, we simulated the facemasks availability from late-December 2019 to late-April 2020 and estimated the duration of sufficient facemask supplies. Our findings showed that if the COVID-19 outbreak occurred only in Wuhan city or Hubei province, facemask shortage would not appear with the existing public health measures. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, a shortage of facemask could be substantial assuming no alternative public health measures. Supplies of facemasks in the whole of China would have been sufficient for both healthcare workers and the general population if the COVID-19 outbreak only occurred in Wuhan city or Hubei province. However, if the outbreak occurred in the whole of China, facemask supplies in China could last for 5 days if under the existing public health measures and a shortage of 853 million facemasks is expected by 30 Apr 2020. Assuming a gradually decreased import volume, we estimated that dramatic increase in productivity (42.7 times of the usual level) is needed to mitigate the facemask crisis by the end of April. In light of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, a shortage of facemasks and other medical resources can considerably compromise the efficacy of public health measures. Effective public health measures should also consider the adequacy and affordability of medical resources. Global collaboration should be strengthened to prevent the development of a global pandemic from a regional epidemic via easing the medical resources crisis in the affected countries.","Wu, Huailiang; Huang, Jian; Zhang, Casper JP; He, Zonglin; Ming, Wai-kit",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.11.20020735,359

Tissue damage, associated with pathological conditions such as infection, cancer or autoimmunity, leads to the exposure of the intracellular content to the extracellular environment. Myeloid cells detect ligands exposed or released by dead cells through specific receptors that signal for a diversity of responses. Inflammatory responses triggered by myeloid cells after sensing tissue injury can contribute to resolution of the damage. The signaling response following dead-cell sensing by myeloid cells can contribute either to an inflammatory or a regulatory response. We review herein some representative examples of how myeloid cells react to the recognition of cell death during specific tissue damage contexts.

The public perceptions and views are vital to facilitate recovered COVID-19 patients reintegrate into society. In China, the rural population accounts for nearly 70% of the total population. Therefore, we chose to evaluate perceptions and views of rural residents towards COVID-19 recovered patients in China. METHODS: Fifteen participants were sampled from a village with the severe COVID-19 epidemic in Zibo city, Shandong Province. The fifteen participants who lived in the village with COVID-19 recovered patients were included. They were over 18 years of age and were voluntary to participant in the study. A descriptive qualitative design using semi-structured telephone interviews was undertaken. Thematic analysis was undertaken. RESULTS: Five main themes emerged from the data: (1) Perceived personal characteristics of COVID-19 recovered patients; (2) Perceived difficulties faced by COVID-19 recovered patients; (3) Perceptions on the social relationship with COVID-19 recovered patients; (4) Views on COVID-19 recovered patients going to public venues; (5) Views on helping COVID-19 recovered patients. Each theme was supported by several subthemes. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that discrimination and reduced social intimacy exist among rural residents. To improve their views or the situation, relevant departments could lead health educational programs and encourage supportive social connections. Through these strategic messaging, rural residents are expected to recognize that COVID-19 recovered patients need more social support, rather than discrimination and resistance, which helps recovered patients better return to society.","Chen, Dandan; Song, Feng; Cui, Nianqi; Tang, Leiwen; Zhang, Hui; Shao, Jing; Qiu, Ruolin; Wang, Dan; Wang, Xiyi; Ye, Zhihong",Int J Gen Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33688242/; https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s293368,359

We aimed to describe the severity of the alpha variant in terms of the pathway of disease from testing positive to hospital admission and death. METHODS: With the approval of NHS England, we linked individual-level data from primary care with SARS-CoV-2 community testing, hospital admission, and ONS all-cause death data. We used testing data with S-gene target failure as a proxy for distinguishing alpha and wild-type cases, and stratified Cox proportional hazards regression to compare the relative severity of alpha cases compared to wild type diagnosed from 16th November 2020 to 11th January 2021. RESULTS: Using data from 185,234 people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the community (alpha=93,153; wild-type=92,081), in fully adjusted analysis accounting for individual-level demographics and comorbidities as well as regional variation in infection incidence, we found alpha associated with 73% higher hazards of all-cause death (aHR: 1.73 (95% CI 1.41 - 2.13; P<.0001)) and 62% higher hazards of hospital admission (aHR: 1.62 ((95% CI 1.48 - 1.78; P<.0001), compared to wild-type virus. Among patients already admitted to ICU, the association between alpha and increased all-cause mortality was smaller and the confidence interval included the null (aHR: 1.20 (95% CI 0.74 - 1.95; P=0.45)).

There is a need to generate more data on clinical characteristics and risks of COVID19 patients presenting with DM. In this retrospective study we aimed to report on demographic features, clinical data, and outcomes of COVID-19 patients with DM in comparison with age- and sex-matched patients without DM. METHODS: This was a retrospective study that relied on the nationwide data on all COVID-19 patients who were diagnosed from 14 March to 18 April, 2020. Overall, there were 31 cases with DM for which we randomly matched 4 patients without DM by age and sex. RESULTS: COVID-19 patients with associated DM had less beneficial outcomes and more severe disease course both at hospital admission and final diagnosis, as compared with the age and sex- matched non-DM patients. Diabetics were more predisposed to impaired breathing (29.0 % versus 4.9 % in controls), nausea/vomiting (6.5 % versus 0 % in controls) and weakness/lethargy (45.2 % versus 26.0 % in controls). Finally, 48.4 % of diabetics showed the signs of pneumonia on CT scans versus 20.3 % of non-diabetics (p = 0.001), and 32.3 % of DM patients were admitted to intensive care units as compared with just 5.7 % of non-DM patients (p<0.001).

The findings show that the cognitive component of SWB, as measured by Cantril’s Ladder, remained stable over the long term. The average respondent reported unchanged life evaluation even when the individual’s negative feelings rose by 52%, and positive feelings fell by 16%. We show evidence for a structural change in the weighting of feelings and self-rated health in life satisfaction function.","Shavit, Tal; Sherman, Arie; Aisenberg, Daniela",Curr Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33758483/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12144-021-01594-x,359

The purpose of this study is to examine the trends in medication utilization among COVID-19 patients across the United States using a national dataset. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of the COVID-19 cohort in the Cerner Real-World Data™ warehouse, which includes de-identified patient information for encounters associated with COVID-19 from December 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020. The primary variables of interest were medications given to patients during their inpatient COVID-19 treatment. We also collected demographics, calculated the proportion of patients with each medication, and stratified by demographic variables. FINDINGS: Our sample included 51,169 inpatients from every region of the United States. Males and females were equally represented, and the majority of patients were white and non-Hispanic. The largest proportion of patients were older than 45 years old. Steroids had the highest utilization among all patients (56.5%), followed by hydroxychloroquine (17.4%), tocilizumab (3.1%), and lopinavir/ritonavir (1.1%). We found substantial variation in medication utilization by region, race, ethnicity, sex, age and insurance status. IMPLICATIONS: Variations in medication use are likely attributable to multiple factors, including the timing of the pandemic by region in the United States and processes by which medications are introduced and disseminated. This study is the first of its kind to assess trends in medication utilization in a national dataset and is the first large descriptive study of pharmacotherapy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. It provides an important glimpse into prescribing patterns during a novel pandemic.","Stroever, Stephanie J.; Ostapenko, Daniel; Scatena, Robyn; Pusztai, Daniel; Coritt, Lauren; Nee, Paul",Clin Ther,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149291821001594?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0149291821001594; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinthera.2021.03.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33958234/,359
663288,"Covid-19: Two vaccine doses are crucial for protection against delta, study finds",2021,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Many research groups have investigated and developed new adjuvant candidates to promote vaccine efficacy, but only few of them were licensed. A combination of toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists can be a promising vaccine adjuvant candidate by stimulating innate immune cells and inducing antigen-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI). In this study, a monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and Poly I:C combination, in low doses with ovalbumin (OVA) protein, elicited strong OVA-specific antibody production and more effective memory T cell responses compared with OVA only, OVA+MPL, OVA+Poly I:C groups at the site of immunization, as well as innate immune cell recruitment and activation. This study suggests MPL+Poly I:C as a potential CMI-inducing vaccine adjuvant candidate. ABSTRACT: Induction of antigen-specific cell-mediated immunity (CMI), as well as humoral immunity, is critical for successful vaccination against various type of pathogens. Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists have been developed as adjuvants to promote vaccine efficacy and induce appropriate immune responses. Monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL); a TLR4 agonist, and Poly I:C; a TLR3 agonist, are known as a strong immuno-stimulator which induce Th1 response. Many studies proved and compared the efficacy of each adjuvant, but no study has investigated the combination of them. Using ovalbumin protein antigen, MPL+Poly I:C combination induced more effective antigen-specific CMI response than single adjuvants. Production of inflammatory cytokines, recruitment of innate immune cells and antigen-specific CD4/CD8 memory T cell at the immunized site had been significantly enhanced by MPL+Poly I:C combination. Moreover, MPL+Poly I:C combination enhanced ovalbumin-specific serum IgG, IgG1, and IgG2c production and proliferative function of CD4 and CD8 T cells after in vitro ovalbumin peptide stimulation. Taken together, these data suggest that the combination of MPL and Poly I:C has a potency as a CMI-inducing vaccine adjuvant with synergistically increased effects.","Ahn, So Yeon; Le, Chau Thuy Tien; Ko, Eun-Ju",Biology (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10090908; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34571785/,359
663342,Clinician Perspectives of COVID-19-Related Cancer Drug Funding Measures in Ontario,2021-02-26,"PURPOSE: Severe COVID-19 patients were prone to develop venous thromboembolism. Unfortunately, to date, there is no evidence of any effective medications for thromboembolism in COVID-19. The management of the disease relies on symptomatic and supportive treatments, giving rise to a variety of guidelines. However, the quality of methodology and clinical recommendations remains unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched Medline, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, websites of international organizations and medical societies, and gray literature databases. Four well-trained appraisers independently evaluated the quality of eligible guidelines and extracted recommendations using well-recognized guideline appraisal tools. Furthermore, recommendations were extracted and reclassified according to a composite grading system. RESULTS: The search identified 23 guidelines that offered 108 recommendations. Guidelines scored average on AGREE II criteria, with Scope and Purpose and Clarity of Presentation highest. Only five (22%) guidelines provided high-quality recommendations. The existed clinical recommendations were inconsistent in terms of prophylaxis, diagnosis, and treatment of thromboembolic disease to some extent. CONCLUSION: Current guidelines for COVID-19 thromboembolism are generally of low quality, and clinical recommendations on thromboembolism are principally supported by insufficient evidence. There is still an urgent need for more well-designed clinical trials as evidence to prevent adverse events and improve prognosis during COVID-19 treatment.","Liang, Jingyi; Wang, Zhufeng; Xie, Jiaxing; Liang, Hanwen; Liang, Jiamin; Jiang, Mei; Li, Shiyue",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34589131/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5513744,359

METHOD: ology: a series of cases including 8 patients with MIS-C treated in two highly complex institutions is presented. These patients, had abdominal symptoms of surgical management. RESULTS: The average age was 9.5 years and the most frequent symptoms were fever, abdominal pain, diarrhea (100%); in addition, 87.5% presented shock. The diagnosis of SARS CoV-2 was confirmed by RT-PCR test in 37.5%, antigen 12.5% and the rest of the patients showed IgM and IgG antibodies. In laboratories, the increase in acute phase reactants, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, as well as troponin, D dimer and proBNP, is highlighted. The surgical outcome documented 2 patients with a normal appendix, 3 patients with edematous appendicitis, and 3 patients with complicated appendicitis.

Analysis of COVID-19 clinical features can help predict disease severity and risk of mortality, early identification of high-risk patients, and provide knowledge to inform clinical interventions. Objective The purpose of this study is to investigate the clinical characteristics and possible predictors associated with mortality in patients with COVID-19 admitted to King Fahad (KFH), Ohood, and Miqat hospitals in Madina, Saudi Arabia. Methods This retrospective observational study to investigate the clinical characteristic and possible predictors associated with mortality for those 119 mild, moderate, or critically ill patients confirmed by laboratory results to have COVID-19 who were admitted to three hospitals in Madina, Saudi Arabia, from March 25, 2020, to July 30, 2020. Data were collected from December 1, 2020, to December 14, 2020. Results Of the 119 patients included in the study, the mean age was 54.2 (±15.7) years, with 78.2% survivors and 21.8% non-survivors. The demographic analysis indicated that the likelihood of mortality for patients in the older age group (i.e., ≥65 years) was five times higher than those in the younger age group (OR = 5.34, 95% CI 1.71–16.68, p = 0.004). The results also indicated those patients who admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) was approximately seven times higher odds of mortality compare with those who were not admitted (OR = 6.48, 95% CI 2.52–16.63, p < 0.001). In addition, six laboratory parameters were positively associated with the odds of mortality: white blood cell count (OR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.02–1.21, p = 0.018), neutrophil (OR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.02–1.22, p = 0.020), creatine kinase myocardial band (OR = 1.02, 95% CI 1.00–1.03, p = 0.030), C-reactive protein (OR = 1.01, 95% CI 1.00–1.01, p = 0.002), urea (OR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.01–1.11, p = 0.026), and lactate dehydrogenase (OR = 1.00, 95% CI 1.00–1.01, p = 0.020). Conclusions In this cohort, COVID-19 patients within the older age group (≥65 years) admitted to the ICU with increased C-reactive protein levels in particular, were associated with increased odds of mortality.

We observed a complete loss of 9-O-acetylation of sialic acid on the surface of myeloid, erythroid and CD4(+) T cells in Casd1-deficient mice. Although 9-O-acetylation of sialic acids on multiple hematopoietic lineages was lost, there were no obvious defects in hematopoiesis. Interestingly, erythrocytes from Casd1-deficient mice also lost reactivity to TER-119, a rat monoclonal antibody that is widely used to mark the murine erythroid lineage. The sialic acid glyco-epitope recognized by TER-119 on erythrocytes was sensitive to the sialic acid O-acetyl esterase activity of the hemagglutinin-esterase from bovine coronavirus but not to the corresponding enzyme from the influenza C virus. During erythrocyte development, TER-119(+) Ery-A and Ery-B cells could be stained by catalytically inactive bovine coronavirus hemagglutinin-esterase but not by the inactive influenza C hemagglutinin-esterase, while TER-119(+) Ery-C cells and mature erythrocytes were recognized by both virolectins. Although the structure of the sialoglycoconjugate recognized by TER-119 was not chemically demonstrated, its selective binding to virolectins suggests that it may be comprised of a 7,9-di-O-acetyl form of sialic acid. As erythrocytes mature, the surfaces of Ery-C cells and mature erythrocytes also acquire an additional distinct CASD1-dependent 9-O-acetyl sialic acid moiety that can be recognized by virolectins from both influenza C and bovine coronavirus.","Mahajan, Vinay S; Alsufyani, Faisal; Mattoo, Hamid; Rosenberg, Ian; Pillai, Shiv",Glycobiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30597004/; https://doi.org/10.1093/glycob/cwy110,359

We demonstrated that CypA played an essential role in EV71 entry and that the RNA interference-mediated reduction of endogenous CypA expression led to decreased EV71 multiplication. We further revealed that CypA directly interacted with and modified the conformation of H-I loop of the VP1 protein in EV71 capsid, and thus regulated the uncoating process of EV71 entry step in a pH-dependent manner.

Data regarding age (< 30 days, 1–11 months, 1–4 years, 5–9 years, 10–14 years, and 15–19 years), gender, color/race, symptoms, pregnancy or puerperium, comorbidities, hospitalization, and death were investigated. Fatality rate and mortality coefficient were calculated, and a multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine if gender, age, and comorbidities were factors associated with death. Of 682 pediatric cases, 52.8% were female, with a mean age of 9 ± 7.2 years. The most frequent symptoms were fever (64.4%), cough (52.4%), and respiratory distress (32.4%).

The flow cytometric method provided repeatable results for neutrophils (coefficients of variations, CVs <15%) but not for monocytes (CVs > 20%) which had also a high individual variability. Compared with saline solution and with non-pathological fAGP, pathological fAGP significantly decreased phagocytosis in neutrophils and monocytes. This study demonstrated that hyposialylated fAGP down-regulates the phagocytic activity of feline neutrophils.","Rossi, G.; Capitani, L.; Ceciliani, F.; Restelli, L.; Paltrinieri, S.",Res Vet Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rvsc.2013.04.026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23726663/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S003452881300163X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003452881300163X,359

They were caused by a previously unknown coronavirus. All patients had been associated with the Wuhan Wholefood market, where seafood and live animals are sold. The virus spread rapidly and public health authorities in China initiated a containment effort. However, by that time, travelers had carried the virus to many countries, sparking memories of the previous coronavirus epidemics, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and causing widespread media attention and panic. Based on clinical criteria and available serological and molecular information, the new disease was called coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19), and the novel coronavirus was called SARS Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), emphasizing its close relationship to the 2002 SARS virus (SARS-CoV). The scientific community raced to uncover the origin of the virus, understand the pathogenesis of the disease, develop treatment options, define the risk factors, and work on vaccine development.

TGEV infection provokes mitochondrial damage of porcine intestinal epthelial cell (IPEC), which is responsible for inflammation and cell death. In our previous study, we have demonstrated that circular RNA circEZH2 was down-regulated during TGEV infection and promoted the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) via targeting miR-22 in porcine intestinal epithelial cell line (IPEC-J2). Activation of NF-κB is an important factor for mitochondrial damage. Mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening is a key reason for mitochondrial damage. So, we speculate that circEZH2 may regulate TGEV-induced mPTP opening via NF-kB pathway. In the present study, we found that mPTP opening of IPEC-J2 was occured during TGEV infection and suppressed by circEZH2 via attaching miR-22. Hexokinase 2 (HK2) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were identified as the targets of miR-22. Silencing HK2 enhanced TGEV-induced mPTP opening, while no effect on NF-κB pathway. Silencing IL-6 promoted TGEV-induced mPTP opening and inhibited NF-κB pathway. Inhibitor of NF-κB increased TGEV-induced mPTP opening. The data revealed that TGEV-induced mPTP opening was regulated via two pathways: circEZH2/miR-22/HK2 axis and circEZH2/miR-22/IL-6/NF-κB axis.","Zhao, Xiaomin; Ma, Xuelian; Guo, Jianxiong; Mi, Mi; Wang, Kaili; Zhang, Chuyi; Tang, Xiaoyi; Chang, Lingling; Huang, Yong; Tong, Dewen",Int J Biol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592229/; https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.36532,359

Previous studies have introduced many experiments showing the germicidal effect of UR-UVGI systems. In this study, a novel numerical method of estimating the germicidal effect of UR-UVGI systems for air exhaled by ward patients was introduced. The method adopts and modifies the concept of ventilation efficiency because the germicidal effect depends upon how the air containing airborne infectious particles flows and stays within UV-radiated area. A case study based on a four-patient ward showed that UV doses were correlated with the age of the air exhaled by a source patient, as expected. Moreover, the UV doses were considerably affected by the position of the UR-UVGI system. Inactivation rates of the influenza virus estimated using the UV doses, were in the range of 48–74%, and those of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were 68–90% in the breathing area of a neighboring patient. The results indicate not directly the decreased concentration of airborne infectious particles, but the possibility of inactivation caused by the UR-UVGI system, which is useful for system optimization.","Sung, Minki; Kato, Shinsuke",Build Environ,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132311001636; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32288012/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132311001636; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2011.05.015,359

Here, we have shown that nucleic acid sensors cGAS-, STING-, MDA5-, MAVS-, or transcription factor IRF3-deficient mice produced high amounts of type I IFN-α and IFN-β (IFN-α/β) in the serum and were resistant to lethal plasmodium yoelii YM infection. Robust IFN-α/β production was abolished when gene encoding nucleic acid sensor TLR7, signaling adaptor MyD88, or transcription factor IRF7 was ablated or pDCs were depleted. Further, we identified SOCS1 as a key negative regulator to inhibit MyD88-dependent type I IFN signaling in pDCs. Finally, we have demonstrated that pDCs, cDCs, and macrophages were required for generating IFN-α/β-induced subsequent protective immunity. Thus, our findings have identified a critical regulatory mechanism of type I IFN signaling in pDCs and stage-specific function of immune cells in generating potent immunity against lethal YM infection.","Yu, Xiao; Cai, Baowei; Wang, Mingjun; Tan, Peng; Ding, Xilai; Wu, Jian; Li, Jian; Li, Qingtian; Liu, Pinghua; Xing, Changsheng; Wang, Helen Y.; Su, Xin-zhuan; Wang, Rong-Fu",Immunity,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761316303892; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2016.10.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27793594/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1074761316303892,359

This study aims to report the clinical characteristics of 147 patients admitted and receiving treatment at a teaching hospital. METHODOLOGY Patients' socio-demographic and epidemiological data, clinical features, laboratory findings and clinical outcomes were extracted using a data sheet. RESULTS The median patient age was 25 [interquartile range (IQR)] 20-44) years, and most of patients were male (68.7%) and of Malaysian nationality (88.4%). Almost half of the patients were from a case cluster related to a religious event (48.3%) and 12.9% had a history of overseas travel. A total of 33.3% of patients were not related to any case cluster, i.e. sporadic cases. Radiological investigation showed that 13.6% of the patients had chest X-ray changes and all laboratory parameters were within the normal ranges. Sixty-six patients (44.9%) experienced symptoms. The most common symptoms were rhinitis (66.7%), followed by fever (19.7%) and cough (15.2%). Age, gender, case cluster, comorbidity status, haemoglobin, albumin, total protein, bilirubin total and alkaline phosphatase level were associated with symptomatic status. CONCLUSIONS In this single-centre study, COVID-19 infection led not only to case clusters, but also to sporadic infections, with patients being either symptomatic or asymptomatic. These sporadic cases and asymptomatic patients may hamper effective contact tracing, leading to rapid human-to-human transmission in our population. Future studies on the prevalence and clinical significance of asymptomatic and presymptomatic COVID-19 patients would pre-emptively address issues on further containment of the pandemic.","Ahmad, Norfazilah; Mohd Ali, Norzehan Fatimah; Mohammed Nawi, Azmawati; Hassan, Mohd Rohaizat; Aizuddin, Azimatun Noor; Hod, Rozita; Daud, Faiz; Salleh, Sharifah Azura; Periyasamy, Petrick; Abdul Gafor, Abdul Halim; Kori, Najma",Journal of infection in developing countries,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34516411/; https://doi.org/10.3855/jidc.13232,359

In this study, we aim to identify specific life changes that correlate with psychological distress within the social context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. In July 2020, workers (company employees and civil servants) in Japan were recruited from local institutions that had not had any confirmed COVID-19 cases as well as neighborhoods that had only a few cases. Participants completed a COVID-19 mental health survey (N = 609; 66.9% male). Psychological distress was identified based on Kessler-6 scores (≥13). Life changes were assessed by an open-ended question about life changes in participants and their family, workplace, and community due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A convergent mixed-method approach was used to compare the context of perceived life changes in participants with psychological distress and those without. As a result, 8.9% of participants had psychological distress, and sex and age categories were different between those with psychological distress and those without. Among the participants who responded to the open-ended question, the biggest life change was “staying at home,” and the next biggest life changes were “event cancellations” and “increased workload” in participants with psychological distress, and “no changes” and “mask-wearing” in those without psychological distress, respectively. Regarding emotional/perceptual changes, “stress,” “fear,” and “anger” were more frequently reported by participants with psychological distress than those without (P <0.001). By integrating these findings, we identified themes focusing on vulnerable characteristics related to psychological distress.

Objective To investigate anti‐bacterial and anti‐allergen antibody responses during convalescence from asthma exacerbation and differences found in exacerbations associated with and without viral infection. Results IgE antibodies to the P6 bacterial antigen increased in 60% of sera during convalescence and for many children achieved titres as high as IgE titres to allergens. In contrast IgE anti‐HDM titres declined during convalescence. The anti‐bacterial IgE titres were the same in subjects with and without virus infection while the anti‐HDM IgE declined more rapidly in virus‐infected subjects. IgG titres to the major HDM allergens showed no consistent increase and the overall IgG anti‐HDM titres even declined in subjects without a virus infection. Anti‐bacterial IgG antibodies in contrast to IgE did not change. Patients with frequent episodic or persistent asthma had similar IgE anti‐bacterial titres to patients with infrequent asthma during the acute phase, although they had reduced IgG titres to both the bacteria and the HDM. Conclusions During the period following an acute exacerbation of asthma there was a marked and specific increase in anti‐bacterial IgE compared with a reduced IgE response to HDM. This provides further support for the concept of T‐helper type 2 responses to bacterial antigens playing a role in asthma pathogenesis.","Hales, B. J.; Martin, A. C.; Pearce, L.

672354,COVID-19: The importance of multidisciplinary approach,2020-06-10,Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) rapidly expands to a global pandemic and its impact on public health varies from country to country. It is caused by a new virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It is imperative for relapsing current antiviral therapeutics owing to randomized genetic drift in global SARS-CoV-2 isolates. A molecular mechanism behind the emerging genomic variants is not yet understood for the prioritization of selective antivirals. The present computational study was aimed to repurpose existing antivirals for Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates by uncovering a hijack mechanism based on structural and functional characteristics of protein variants. Forty-one protein mutations were identified in 12 Indian SARS-CoV-2 isolates by analysis of genome variations across 460 genome sequences obtained from 30 geographic sites in India. Two unique mutations such as W6152R and N5928H found in exonuclease of Surat (GBRC275b) and Gandhinagar (GBRC239) isolates. We report for the first time the impact of folding rate on stabilizing/retaining a sequence-structure-function-virulence link of emerging protein variants leading to accommodate hijack ability from current antivirals. Binding affinity analysis revealed the effect of point mutations on virus infectivity and the drug-escaping efficiency of Indian isolates. Emodin and artinemol suggested herein as repurposable antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19 patients infected with Indian isolates. Our study concludes that a protein folding rate is a key structural and evolutionary determinant to enhance the receptor-binding specificity and ensure hijack ability from the prevalent antiviral therapeutics.,"Prathiviraj, R.; Saranya, S.; Bharathi, M.; Chellapandi, P.",Comput Biol Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33705994/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2021.104315; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010482521001098?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0010482521001098,359

Three types of organic load were used: 0.3% albumin, 10% fetal calf serum, and 0.3% albumin with 0.3% sheep erythrocytes. Virus titres were determined by a quantitative test (endpoint titration) in 96-well microtitre plates. With all tested preparations, SARS-CoV was inactivated to below the limit of detection (reduction factor mostly ≥4), regardless of the type of organic load.

Adults with suspected CAP enrolled in the ESCAPED study (impact of computed tomography on CAP diagnosis) had prospective nasopharyngeal (NP) samples studied by multiplex PCR (targeting 15 viruses and four intracellular bacteria). An adjudication committee composed of infectious disease specialists, pneumologists and radiologists blinded to PCR results reviewed patient records, including computed tomography and day 28 follow up, to categorize final diagnostic probability of CAP as definite, probable, possible, or excluded. Among the 254 patients enrolled, 78 (31%) had positive PCR, which detected viruses in 72/254 (28%) and intracellular bacteria in 8 (3%) patients. PCR was positive in 44/125 (35%) patients with definite CAP and 21/83 (25%) patients with excluded CAP. The most frequent organisms were influenza A/B virus in 27 (11%), rhinovirus in 20 (8%), coronavirus in seven (3%), respiratory syncytial virus in seven (3%) and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in eight (3%) of 254 patients. Proportion of rhinovirus was higher in patients with excluded CAP compared with other diagnostic categories (p = 0.01). No such difference was observed for influenza virus. Viruses seem common in adults attending emergency departments with suspected CAP. A concomitant clinical, radiological and biological analysis of the patient's chart can contribute to either confirm their role, or suggest upper respiratory tract infection or shedding.

673107,Concerns about Proposed Update to COVID-19 Screening Protocols before Surgery: In Reply to Yenigun and Colleagues,2020-09-18,"The activating immune receptor natural killer group member D (NKG2D) and its cognate ligands represent a fundamental surveillance system of cellular distress, damage or transformation. Signaling through the NKG2D receptor-ligand axis is critical for early detection of viral infection or oncogenic transformation and the presence of functional NKG2D ligands (NKG2D-L) is associated with tumor rejection and viral clearance. Many viruses and tumors have developed mechanisms to evade NKG2D recognition via transcriptional, post-transcriptional or post-translational interference with NKG2D-L, supporting the concept that circumventing immune evasion of the NKG2D receptor-ligand axis may be an attractive therapeutic avenue for antiviral therapy or cancer immunotherapy. To date, the complexity of the NKG2D receptor-ligand axis and the lack of specificity of current NKG2D-targeting therapies has not allowed for the precise manipulation required to optimally harness NKG2D-mediated immunity. However, with the discovery of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins, novel opportunities have arisen in the realm of locus-specific gene editing and regulation. Here, we give a brief overview of the NKG2D receptor-ligand axis in humans and discuss the levels at which NKG2D-L are regulated and dysregulated during viral infection and oncogenesis. Moreover, we explore the potential for CRISPR-based technologies to provide novel therapeutic avenues to improve and maximize NKG2D-mediated immunity.","Alves, Eric; McLeish, Emily; Blancafort, Pilar; Coudert, Jerome D.; Gaudieri, Silvana",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34456921/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.712722,359
673536,A biomarker based severity progression indicator for COVID-19: the Kuwait prognosis indicator score,2020-11-24,"Segmentation of infections from CT scans is important for accurate diagnosis and follow-up in tackling the COVID-19. Although the convolutional neural network has great potential to automate the segmentation task, most existing deep learning-based infection segmentation methods require fully annotated ground-truth labels for training, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This paper proposed a novel weakly supervised segmentation method for COVID-19 infections in CT slices, which only requires scribble supervision and is enhanced with the uncertainty-aware self-ensembling and transformation-consistent techniques. Specifically, to deal with the difficulty caused by the shortage of supervision, an uncertainty-aware mean teacher is incorporated into the scribble-based segmentation method, encouraging the segmentation predictions to be consistent under different perturbations for an input image. This mean teacher model can guide the student model to be trained using information in images without requiring manual annotations. On the other hand, considering the output of the mean teacher contains both correct and unreliable predictions, equally treating each prediction in the teacher model may degrade the performance of the student network. To alleviate this problem, the pixel level uncertainty measure on the predictions of the teacher model is calculated, and then the student model is only guided by reliable predictions from the teacher model. To further regularize the network, a transformation-consistent strategy is also incorporated, which requires the prediction to follow the same transformation if a transform is performed on an input image of the network.

674374,COVID-19 and Jaundice,2020-10-08,"Background: The prevalence and significance of digestive manifestations in COVID-19 remain uncertain. Methods: Consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were identified across a geographically diverse alliance of medical centers in North America. Data pertaining to baseline characteristics, symptomatology, laboratory assessment, imaging, and endoscopic findings from the time of symptom onset until discharge or death were manually abstracted from electronic health records to characterize the prevalence, spectrum, and severity of digestive manifestations. Regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between digestive manifestations and severe outcomes related to COVID-19. Results: A total of 1992 patients across 36 centers met eligibility criteria and were included. Overall, 53% of patients experienced at least one gastrointestinal symptom at any time during their illness, most commonly diarrhea (34%), nausea (27%), vomiting (16%), and abdominal pain (11%). In 74% of cases, gastrointestinal symptoms were judged to be mild. In total, 35% of patients developed an abnormal alanine aminotransferase or total bilirubin level; these were elevated to less than 5 times the upper limit of normal in 77% of cases. After adjusting for potential confounders, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms at any time (odds ratio 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.76-1.15) or liver test abnormalities on admission (odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.80-2.12) were not independently associated with mechanical ventilation or death. Conclusions: Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, gastrointestinal symptoms and liver test abnormalities were common but the majority were mild and their presence was not associated with a more severe clinical course.","Elmunzer, B.

Previous research has suggested that an overactivation of the host inflammatory response is at least partly involved in mediating the kidney damage observed in P. falciparum patients with AKI, however the exact pathophysiology of AKI in severe malaria remains unknown. The purpose of this mini-review is to describe how different aspects of malaria pathology, including parasite sequestration, microvascular obstruction and extensive intravascular hemolysis, may interact with each other and contribute to the development of AKI in severe malaria, by amplifying the damaging effects of the host inflammatory response. Here, we highlight the importance of considering how the systemic effects and multi-organ involvement of malaria are intertwined with the localized effects on the kidney.","Katsoulis, Orestis; Georgiadou, Athina; Cunnington, Aubrey J.",Front Immunol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.651739; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33968051/,359

The median age was 54.1 years (1.0–80.3) for allogeneic, and 60.6 years (7.7–81.6) for autologous HCT patients. The median time from HCT to COVID-19 was 15.8 months (0.2–292.7) in allogeneic and 24.6 months (−0.9 to 350.3) in autologous recipients. 83.5% developed lower respiratory tract disease and 22.5% were admitted to an ICU. Overall survival at 6 weeks from diagnosis was 77.9% and 72.1% in allogeneic and autologous recipients, respectively. Children had a survival of 93.4%. In multivariate analysis, older age (p = 0.02), need for ICU (p < 0.0001) and moderate/high immunodeficiency index (p = 0.04) increased the risk while better performance status (p = 0.001) decreased the risk for mortality. Other factors such as underlying diagnosis, time from HCT, GVHD, or ongoing immunosuppression did not significantly impact overall survival. We conclude that HCT patients are at high risk of developing LRTD, require admission to ICU, and have increased mortality in COVID-19.","Ljungman, Per; de la Camara, Rafael; Mikulska, Malgorzata; Tridello, Gloria; Aguado, Beatriz; Zahrani, Mohsen Al; Apperley, Jane; Berceanu, Ana; Bofarull, Rodrigo Martino; Calbacho, Maria; Ciceri, Fabio; Lopez-Corral, Lucia; Crippa, Claudia; Fox, Maria Laura; Grassi, Anna; Jimenez, Maria-Jose; Demir, Safiye Koçulu; Kwon, Mi; Llamas, Carlos Vallejo; Lorenzo, José Luis López; Mielke, Stephan; Orchard, Kim; Porras, Rocio Parody; Vallisa, Daniele; Xhaard, Alienor; Knelange, Nina Simone; Cedillo, Angel; Kröger, Nicolaus; Piñana, José Luis; Styczynski, Jan",Leukemia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34079042/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41375-021-01302-5,359

As the face mask is usually made from polymers and phthalates are widely-used additives into the polymers, the face mask could be a potential source of phthalate exposure to humans. However, limited knowledge is available on the occurrence and risks of the phthalates from the face mask. In this study, twelve phthalates were determined in 56 mask samples collected from different countries. The phthalates were detected in all the samples with total levels ranging from 115 ng/g to 37,700 ng/g. Estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of the phthalates from the masks ranged from 3.71 to 639 ng/kg-bw/day, and the EDIs of the phthalates from masks for toddlers were approximately 4–5 times higher than those for adults. Non-carcinogenic risks in relation to the phthalates in masks were found to be within safe levels, yet 89.3% of the mask samples exhibited potential carcinogenic effects to humans. The extent of the risks for wearing masks located at a moderate level comparing with other skin-contacted products. This study unveiled a potential source of phthalate exposure to human, and indicated necessity of managing types and levels of additives in the face masks.","Xie, Huaijun; Han, Wenjing; Xie, Qing; Xu, Tong; Zhu, Minghua; Chen, Jingwen",J Hazard Mater,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0304389421018161; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126848; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389421018161; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34403943/,359
675521,Immunosuppression as a Hallmark of Critical COVID-19: Prospective Study,2021-05-23,"Publisher Summary This chapter focuses on the tissue distribution, structure, and functions of the leucocyte antigen CD13. CD13 is expressed by granulocytes and monocytes and their precursors. CD13 is a marker for most acute myeloid leukaemias and a smaller proportion of acute lymphoid leukaemias. Various nonhematopoietic cells express CD13, including epithelial cells from renal proximal tubules and intestinal brush border, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, brain cells, bone marrow stromal cells, osteoclasts, and cells lining the biliary caniculae. CD13 is a member of a group of type II integral membrane metalloproteases that includes the leucocyte antigens CD10, CD26, CD73, and BP-1. The CD13 glycoprotein has a short N-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane region that functions as a signal peptide, and a large C-terminal extracellular region that contains 11 N-linked glycosylation sites and also O-linked glycosylation. CD13 is a receptor for coronaviruses, RNA viruses that cause respiratory diseases in humans and several species of animals. The binding site on CD 13 for the swine coronavirus TGEV (transmissible gastroenteritis virus) is distinct from the enzymatic site. CD13 is a zinc-binding metalloprotease that plays a role in cell surface antigen presentation by trimming the N-terminal amino acids from MHC Class II-bound peptides.","Barclay, A.

However, recent progress in PX could allow for a more integrated role into early drug discovery. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the interplay of high throughput synthesis and high throughput PX. We describe a practical multicomponent reaction approach to acrylamides and ‐esters from diverse building blocks suitable for mmol scale synthesis on 96‐well format and on a high‐throughput nanoscale format in a highly automated fashion. High‐throughput PX of our libraries efficiently yielded potent covalent inhibitors of the main protease of the COVID‐19 causing agent, SARS‐CoV‐2.

The recommendations on pharmacological prophylaxis against COVID-19 infection are controversial. The aim of current study was to assess PPE practices during surgery on COVID-19 negative gynecological cancer patients and use of pharmacologic prophylaxis by clinicians practicing gynecologic oncology. METHODS: We disbursed a survey questionnaire through various social media platforms among clinicians practicing gynecologic oncology. The survey consisted of 37 questions divided into five subgroups evaluating demographic details, use of pharmacological prophylaxis against COVID-19, preoperative COVID-19 screening protocol, details on PPE usage and associated discomfort, if any. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty oncologists from 13 countries responded to the survey. Pharmacological prophylaxis was being used by 85 (38.6%) respondents; most common agent was hydroxychloroquin (HCQ) by 24.5% respondents. Routine preoperative screening for COVID-19 was performed by 214 (97.3%) respondents. Some degree of discomfort during surgery due to PPE use was reported by 170 (77.3%) respondents, which was moderate to severe in 73 (33.2%) respondents. Most common difficulties associated with face mask/shield were problems in communication (69.5%) and breathing (58.1%). Eye protection was associated with poor visibility, fogging and headache. Unusual fatigue attributed to PPE use was experienced by 143(65%) respondents. CONCLUSION: Use of pharmacological prophylaxis against COVID-19 is controversial and the same is reflected in our survey.

The goal of this study was to predict the gaseous pollutant transmission using computational fluid dynamics based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations and baseline k-ω turbulence equations. The results indicated that ventilation rates generally increased with increasing wind speeds if the effects of buoyancy and wind were not suppressed; however, the re-entry ratio representing the proportion of expelled air re-entering other floors and the corresponding risk of infection decreased. If the source of the virus was on a central floor, the risk of infection was the highest on the floors closest to the source. Different window types were also considered for determining their effectiveness in controlling cross-transmission and infection risk, depending on the source location and driving force (e.g., buoyancy and wind).","Wang, Jihong; Huo, Qiannan; Zhang, Tengfei; Wang, Shugang; Battaglia, Francine",Build Environ,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0360132320300639; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2020.106705; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32287994/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132320300639,359

678672,COVID-19: Lessons from Norway tragedy must be considered in vaccine rollout planning in least developed/developing countries,2021-08-11,"BACKGROUND: There has been a variation in published opinions toward the effectiveness of school closure which is implemented reactively when substantial influenza transmissions are seen at schools. Parameterizing an age-structured epidemic model using published estimates of the pandemic H1N1-2009 and accounting for the cost effectiveness, we examined if the timing and length of school closure could be optimized. METHODS: Age-structured renewal equation was employed to describe the epidemic dynamics of an influenza pandemic. School closure was assumed to take place only once during the course of the pandemic, abruptly reducing child-to-child transmission for a fixed length of time and also influencing the transmission between children and adults. Public health effectiveness was measured by reduction in the cumulative incidence, and cost effectiveness was also examined by calculating the incremental cost effectiveness ratio and adopting a threshold of 1.0 × 10(7) Japanese Yen/life-year. RESULTS: School closure at the epidemic peak appeared to yield the largest reduction in the final size, while the time of epidemic peak was shown to depend on the transmissibility. As the length of school closure was extended, we observed larger reduction in the cumulative incidence. Nevertheless, the cost effectiveness analysis showed that the cost of our school closure scenario with the parameters derived from H1N1-2009 was not justifiable. If the risk of death is three times or greater than that of H1N1-2009, the school closure could be regarded as cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: There is no fixed timing and duration of school closure that can be recommended as universal guideline for different types of influenza viruses. The effectiveness of school closure depends on the transmission dynamics of a particular influenza virus strain, especially the virulence (i.e. the infection fatality risk).","Nishiura, Hiroshi; Ejima, Keisuke; Mizumoto, Kenji; Nakaoka, Shinji; Inaba, Hisashi; Imoto, Seiya; Yamaguchi, Rui; Saito, Masaya M",Theor Biol Med Model,https://doi.org/10.1186/1742-4682-11-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24447310/,359

679742,Worldwide inverse correlation between Bacille Calmette–Guérin (BCG) immunization and COVID-19 mortality,2021-01-25,"The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected Latino adults aged 50 and older in California. Among adults aged 50–64, Latinos constitute approximately one-third (32%) of the population, but over half (52%) of COVID-19 cases, and more than two-thirds (64%) of COVID-related deaths as of June 2, 2021. These health disparities are also prevalent among Latinos 65 years and older who constitute 22% of the population, but 40% of confirmed COVID-19 cases and 50% of COVID-related deaths. Emergency medical services (EMS) are an essential component of the United States healthcare system and a vital sector in COVID-19 response efforts. Using data from the California Emergency Medical Services Information System (CEMSIS), this study examines racial and ethnic differences in respiratory distress related EMS calls among adults aged 50 and older in all counties except Los Angeles. This study compares the early pandemic period, January to June 2020, to the same time period in 2019. Between January and June 2019, Latinos aged 50 and older had statistically significantly lower odds of respiratory distress related EMS calls compared to Blacks, Asians, and Whites. During the early pandemic period, January to June 2020, Latinos aged 50 and older had statistically significantly lower odds of respiratory distress related EMS calls compared to Blacks but slightly higher odds compared to Whites. Differences by race/ethnicity and region were statistically significant. Understanding EMS health disparities is crucial to inform policies that create a more equitable prehospital care system for the heterogeneous population of middle aged and older adults.","Melgoza, Esmeralda; Beltrán-Sánchez, Hiram; Bustamante, Arturo Vargas",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2021.660289; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34497790/,359
679749,A Method to Model Outbreaks of New Infectious Diseases with Pandemic Potential such as COVID-19,2020-03-16,"The use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) for people with HIV (PWH) has improved life expectancy. However, PWH now lose more life-years to tobacco use than to HIV infection. Unfortunately, PWH smoke at higher rates and have more difficulty maintaining abstinence than the general population, compounding their risk for chronic disease. In this Commentary, we describe a United States National Cancer Institute (NCI)-led initiative to address the relative lack of research focused on developing, testing, and implementing smoking cessation interventions for PWH. This initiative supports seven clinical trials designed to systematically test and/or develop and test adaptations of evidence-based smoking cessation interventions for PWH (e.g., combination of behavioral and pharmacological). We summarize each project, including setting/recruitment sites, inclusion/exclusion criteria, interventions being tested, and outcomes. This initiative provides critical opportunities for collaboration and data harmonization across projects. The knowledge gained will inform strategies to assist PWH to promote and maintain abstinence, and ensure that these efforts are adaptable and scalable, thereby addressing one of the major threats to the health of PWH. Reducing smoking behavior may be particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic given that smokers who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 may be at risk for more severe disease.","Ashare, Rebecca L; Bernstein, Steven L; Schnoll, Robert; Gross, Robert; Catz, Sheryl L; Cioe, Patricia; Crothers, Kristina; Hitsman, Brian; Marhefka, Stephanie L; McClure, Jennifer B; Pacek, Lauren R; Vidrine, Damon J; Vilardaga, Roger; Kaufman, Annette; Edelman, E Jennifer",Nicotine Tob Res,https://doi.org/10.1093/ntr/ntaa155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32803251/,359
680255,Challenges Caused by Imported Cases Abroad for the Prevention and Control of COVID-19 in China,2021-05-20,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic fundamentally changed every aspect of healthcare delivery and training. Few studies have reported on the impact of these changes on the experiences, skill development, and career expectations of medical students. METHOD: Using 59 responses to a short reflection essay prompt, 3rd year medical students in Philadelphia described how the COVID-19 pandemic affected their education in mid-2020. Using conventional content analysis, six main themes were identified across 14 codes. RESULTS: Students reported concerns regarding their decreased clinical skill training and specialty exposure on their career development due to the loss of in-person experience during their family medicine clerkship. A small number felt very let down and exploited by the continued high cost of tuition while missing clinical interactions. However, many students also expressed professional pride and derived meaning from limited patient and mentorship opportunities. Many students developed a new sense of purpose and a call to become stronger public health and patient advocates. CONCLUSIONS: The medical field will need to adapt to support medical students adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, from an educational and mental health standpoint. However, there are encouraging signs that this may also galvanize many students to engage in leadership roles in their communities, to become more empathetic and thoughtful physicians, and to redesign healthcare in the future to better meet the needs of their most vulnerable patients.","Kelly, Erin L.; Casola, Allison R.; Smith, Kelsey; Kelly, Samantha; de la Cruz, Maria Syl D.",BMC Med Educ,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12909-021-02906-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34496820/,359
680479,Increased number of cases of giant cell arteritis and higher rates of ophthalmic involvement during the era of COVID-19,2020-12-01,"The experience of owning a body is built upon the integration of exteroceptive, interoceptive, and proprioceptive signals. Recently, it has been suggested that motor signals could be particularly important in producing the feeling of body part ownership. One thus may hypothesize that the strength of this feeling may not be spatially uniform; rather, it could vary as a function of the degree by which different body parts are involved in motor behavior. Given that our dominant hand plays a leading role in our motor behavior, we hypothesized that it could be more strongly associated with one’s self compared to its non-dominant counterpart. To explore whether this possible asymmetry manifests as a stronger implicit association of the right hand (vs left hand) with the self, we administered the Implicit Association Test to a group of 70 healthy individuals. To control whether this asymmetric association is human-body specific, we further tested whether a similar asymmetry characterizes the association between a right (vs left) animal body part with the concept of self, in an independent sample of subjects (N = 70, 140 subjects total). Our results revealed a linear relationship between the magnitude of the implicit association between the right hand with the self and the subject’s handedness. In detail, the strength of this association increased as a function of hand preference. Critically, the handedness score did not predict the association of the right-animal body part with the self. These findings suggest that, in healthy individuals, the dominant and non-dominant hands are differently perceived at an implicit level as belonging to the self. We argue that such asymmetry may stem from the different roles that the two hands play in our adaptive motor behavior.","Crivelli, Damiano; Peviani, Valeria; Salvato, Gerardo; Bottini, Gabriella",Front Hum Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2021.681904; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34305551/,359

681347,Filtration Performance Degradation of In‐Use Masks by Vapors from Alcohol‐Based Hand Sanitizers and the Mitigation Solutions,2021-06-27,"Aims During the COVID-19 pandemic, many health-related questions require rapid answers. In the Competence Network Public Health COVID-19, founded by representatives of several scientific societies in March 2020, rapid reviews are often conducted to generate evidence-based answers that are useful for policy makers. The aim of this paper is to reflect on the practical experience with rapid reviews in the context of the Competence Network Public Health. Methods for high-quality and practicable implementation of rapid reviews were developed, which are particularly helpful for rapid evidence generation based on observational studies. Methods Using the 8-step approach proposed by Tricco et al. [1], we describe the acute challenges that have arisen in the Public Health Competence Network COVID-19 while conducting rapid reviews on public health-related issues related to the COVID-19-pandemic. The 8 steps are: 1. conceptualization of the research question, 2. literature search, 3. title/abstract and full text screening, 4. data extraction, 5. risk of bias assessment, 6. evidence synthesis, 7. dissemination, 8. update. We develop a methodological approach for conducting rapid reviews by expert consensus of the members (n=42 as of 01/28/2021) of the Rapid Reviews Working Group in the Competence Network Public Health COVID-19. Results A standardized approach is presented that closely follows the approach of the Cochrane Rapid Reviews Methods Group and takes into account the special requirements of etiological – but often also ecological – observational studies on COVID-19. Conclusions The proposed approach for conducting rapid reviews can form an important basis for evidence-based policy advice – certainly beyond questions related to COVID-19. Flexible and rapid funding concepts should be made available for the short-term realization of methodologically high-quality rapid reviews on emerging questions. Scientific cooperation in conducting rapid reviews needs to be expanded, and more methodologically high-quality approaches such as prospective meta-analyses should be used.","Seidler, Andreas; Nußbaumer-Streit, Barbara; Apfelbacher, Christian; Zeeb, Hajo",Gesundheitswesen,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33634462/; https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1380-0926,359

We therefore compare the properties of the mutated S protein (S(G614)) with the original (S(D614)). We report here pseudoviruses carrying S(G614) enter ACE2-expressing cells more efficiently than those with S(D614). This increased entry correlates with less S1-domain shedding and higher S-protein incorporation into the virion. Similar results are obtained with virus-like particles produced with SARS-CoV-2 M, N, E, and S proteins. However, D614G does not alter S-protein binding to ACE2 or neutralization sensitivity of pseudoviruses. Thus, D614G may increase infectivity by assembling more functional S protein into the virion.","Zhang, Lizhou; Jackson, Cody B.; Mou, Huihui; Ojha, Amrita; Peng, Haiyong; Quinlan, Brian D.; Rangarajan, Erumbi S.; Pan, Andi; Vanderheiden, Abigail; Suthar, Mehul S.; Li, Wenhui; Izard, Tina; Rader, Christoph; Farzan, Michael; Choe, Hyeryun",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33243994/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-19808-4,359

However, the climate of the pandemic has also seen anti-vaccination sentiments flourish. AIMS: To determine the intent to accept COVID-19 vaccination among healthcare workers at a London Hospital Trust and examine variation in uptake between demographic groups. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey open to staff working at the trust. Staff rated on a five-point scale the likelihood of them accepting COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS: We received 514 responses, representing 16% of the workforce. About 59% of staff intended to seek vaccination, 24% to reject and 17% were unsure. There was significantly reduced intended uptake in females, younger age groups, healthcare assistants, nurses, staff of black ethnic backgrounds and those who rejected influenza vaccination. Safety was the dominant concern. CONCLUSIONS: Our study finds COVID-19 vaccinate hesitancy is prevalent among healthcare workers at a London Hospital Trust. It is particularly concerning that hesitancy was highest amongst groups most exposed to COVID-19 and most at risk of severe disease. Reasons behind disparities in uptake must be addressed to protect staff and prevent deepening inequalities within the healthcare workforce.","Abuown, A; Ellis, T; Miller, J; Davidson, R; Kachwala, Q; Medeiros, M; Mejia, K; Manoraj, S; Sidhu, M; Whittington, A M; Pattani, S",Occup Med (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34002797/; https://doi.org/10.1093/occmed/kqab057,359

To help mitigate this burden, novel solutions including telehealth and dedicated screening facilities have been used. However, there is limited data on the efficacy of such models and none assessing patient comfort levels with these changes in healthcare delivery. The aim of our study was to evaluate patients’ perceptions of a drive-through medical treatment system in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHOD: Patients presenting to a drive-through COVID-19 medical treatment facility were surveyed about their experience following their visit. An anonymous questionnaire consisting of five questions, using a five-point Likert scale was distributed via electronic tablet. RESULTS: We obtained 827 responses over two months. Three quarters of respondents believed care received was similar to that in a traditional emergency department (ED). Overall positive impression of the drive-through was 86.6%, and 95% believed that it was more convenient. CONCLUSION: Overall, the drive-through medical system was perceived as more convenient than the ED and was viewed as a positive experience. While representing a dramatic change in the delivery model of medical care, if such systems can provide comparable levels of care, they may be a viable option for sustained and surge healthcare delivery.","Stuart, Sean; Mandichak, Sally; Davison, Julianne; Ansell, Shai; Parker, Timothy",West J Emerg Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34546877/; https://doi.org/10.5811/westjem.2021.3.51319,359
682134,Post-COVID syndrome and suicide risk,2021-01-24,"BACKGROUND: The introduction of the bacterium Wolbachia (wMel strain) into Aedes aegypti mosquitoes reduces their capacity to transmit dengue and other arboviruses. Evidence of a reduction in dengue case incidence following field releases of wMel-infected Ae. aegypti has been reported previously from a cluster randomised controlled trial in Indonesia, and quasi-experimental studies in Indonesia and northern Australia. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Following pilot releases in 2015–2016 and a period of intensive community engagement, deployments of adult wMel-infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes were conducted in Niterói, Brazil during 2017–2019. Deployments were phased across four release zones, with a total area of 83 km(2) and a residential population of approximately 373,000. A quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate the effectiveness of wMel deployments in reducing dengue, chikungunya and Zika incidence. An untreated control zone was pre-defined, which was comparable to the intervention area in historical dengue trends. The wMel intervention effect was estimated by controlled interrupted time series analysis of monthly dengue, chikungunya and Zika case notifications to the public health surveillance system before, during and after releases, from release zones and the control zone. Three years after commencement of releases, wMel introgression into local Ae. aegypti populations was heterogeneous throughout Niterói, reaching a high prevalence (>80%) in the earliest release zone, and more moderate levels (prevalence 40–70%) elsewhere. Despite this spatial heterogeneity in entomological outcomes, the wMel intervention was associated with a 69% reduction in dengue incidence (95% confidence interval 54%, 79%), a 56% reduction in chikungunya incidence (95%CI 16%, 77%) and a 37% reduction in Zika incidence (95%CI 1%, 60%), in the aggregate release area compared with the pre-defined control area. This significant intervention effect on dengue was replicated across all four release zones, and in three of four zones for chikungunya, though not in individual release zones for Zika. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We demonstrate that wMel Wolbachia can be successfully introgressed into Ae. aegypti populations in a large and complex urban setting, and that a significant public health benefit from reduced incidence of Aedes-borne disease accrues even where the prevalence of wMel in local mosquito populations is moderate and spatially heterogeneous. These findings are consistent with the results of randomised and non-randomised field trials in Indonesia and northern Australia, and are supportive of the Wolbachia biocontrol method as a multivalent intervention against dengue, chikungunya and Zika.","Pinto, Sofia B.; Riback, Thais I.

682352,Clinical Omissions in COVID-19,2021-07-30,"BACKGROUND: Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a distressing and disabling condition that affects significant numbers of children and adolescents. Youth exposed to multiple traumas (eg, abuse, domestic violence) are at particular risk of developing PTSD. Cognitive therapy for PTSD (CT-PTSD), derived from adult work, is a theoretically informed, disorder-specific form of trauma-focused cognitive–behavioural therapy. While efficacious for child and adolescent single-event trauma samples, its effectiveness in routine settings with more complex, multiple trauma-exposed youth has not been established. The Delivery of Cognitive Therapy for Young People after Trauma randomised controlled trial (RCT) examines the effectiveness of CT-PTSD for treating PTSD following multiple trauma exposure in children and young people in comparison with treatment as usual (TAU). METHODS/DESIGN: This protocol describes a two-arm, patient-level, single blind, superiority RCT comparing CT-PTSD (n=60) with TAU (n=60) in children and young people aged 8–17 years with a diagnosis of PTSD following multiple trauma exposure. The primary outcome is PTSD severity assessed using the Children’s Revised Impact of Event Scale (8-item version) at post-treatment (ie, approximately 5 months post-randomisation). Secondary outcomes include structured interview assessment for PTSD, complex PTSD symptoms, depression and anxiety, overall functioning and parent-rated mental health. Mid-treatment and 11-month and 29-month post-randomisation assessments will also be completed. Process–outcome evaluation will consider which mechanisms underpin or moderate recovery. Qualitative interviews with the young people, their families and their therapists will be undertaken. Cost-effectiveness of CT-PTSD relative to TAU will be also be assessed. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This trial protocol has been approved by a UK Health Research Authority Research Ethics Committee (East of England–Cambridge South, 16/EE/0233). Findings will be disseminated broadly via peer-reviewed empirical journal articles, conference presentations and clinical workshops. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN12077707. Registered 24 October 2016 (http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN12077707). Trial recruitment commenced on 1 February 2017.

The apple variety and production methods are two factors that play a major role in determining the quality of vinegar. Therefore, this study aims to determine the quality of apple vinegar samples from different varieties (Red Delicious, Gala, Golden Delicious, and Starking Delicious) prepared by three methods using small apple pieces, apple juice, and crushed apple, through determining the physicochemical properties and antibacterial activity of these samples. The antibacterial activity was studied against five pathogenic bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, Escherichia coli (ATB: 57), Escherichia coli (ATB: 97), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, using two methods, disk diffusion and microdilution, for determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations and the minimum bactericidal concentrations. The results of this study showed that the lowest pH value was 3.6 for Stark Delicious, obtained by liquid fermentation, and the highest acetic acid values were 4.7 and 4% for the vinegar of Red Delicious and Golden Delicious, prepared by solid fermentation, respectively. The results of the antibacterial activity showed considerable activity of apple vinegar on the tested strains. Generally, the Staphylococcus aureus strain appears less sensitive and Pseudomonas aeruginosa seems to be very sensitive against all samples, while the other strains have distinct sensitivities depending on the variety studied and the method used. A higher antibacterial activity was found in vinegar obtained by the apple pieces method and the Red Delicious variety, with a low MIC and MBC recorded, at 1.95 and 3.90 µL/mL, respectively. This study has shown that the choice of both apple variety and production method is therefore an essential step in determining and aiming for the desired quality of apple vinegar.","Kara, Mohammed; Assouguem, Amine; kamaly, Omkulthom Mohamed Al; Benmessaoud, Safaâ; Imtara, Hamada; Mechchate, Hamza; Hano, Christophe; Zerhouni, Abdou Rachid; Bahhou, Jamila",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34576910/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26185437,359

The UK’s LDKT activity falls behind that of many other countries, and there is evidence of socioeconomic inequity in access. We aimed to develop a UK-specific multicomponent intervention to support eligible individuals to access a LDKT. The intervention was designed to support those who are socioeconomically-deprived and currently disadvantaged, by targeting mediators of inequity identified in earlier work. We identified three existing interventions in the literature which target these mediators: a) the Norway model (healthcare practitioners contact patients’ family with information about kidney donation), b) a home education model, and c) a Transplant candidate advocate model. We undertook intervention development using the Person-Based Approach (PBA). We performed in-depth qualitative interviews with people with advanced kidney disease (n = 13), their family members (n = 4), and renal and transplant healthcare practitioners (n = 15), analysed using thematic analysis. We investigated participant views on each proposed intervention component. We drafted intervention resources and revised these in light of comments from qualitative ‘think-aloud’ interviews. Four general themes were identified: i) Perceived cultural and societal norms; ii) Influence of family on decision-making; iii) Resource limitation, and iv) Evidence of effectiveness.

683524,The Virtual Mock Oral Examination: A Multi-institutional Study of Resident and Faculty Receptiveness,2021-02-26,"Post-COVID syndrome is increasingly recognized as a new clinical entity in the context of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Symptoms persisting for more than three weeks after the diagnosis of COVID-19 characterize the post-COVID syndrome. Its incidence ranges from 10% to 35%, however, rates as high as 85% have been reported among patients with a history of hospitalization. Currently, there is no consensus on the classification of post-COVID syndrome. We reviewed the published information on post-COVID syndrome, putting emphasis on its pathogenesis. The pathogenesis of post-COVID syndrome is multi-factorial and more than one mechanism may be implicated in several clinical manifestations. Prolonged inflammation has a key role in its pathogenesis and may account for some neurological complications, cognitive dysfunction, and several other symptoms. A multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) of all ages has been also described recently, similarly to multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). The post-infectious inflammatory pathogenetic mechanism of MIS-A is supported by the fact that its diagnosis is established through serology in up to one third of cases. Other pathogenetic mechanisms that are implicated in post-COVID syndrome include immune-mediated vascular dysfunction, thromboembolism, and nervous system dysfunction. Although the current data are indicating that the overwhelming majority of patients with post-COVID syndrome have a good prognosis, registries to actively follow them are needed in order to define the full clinical spectrum and its long-term outcome. A consensus-based classification of post-COVID syndrome is essential to guide clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic management. Further research is also imperative to elucidate the pathogenesis of post-COVID syndrome.","Maltezou, Helena C.; Pavli, Androula; Tsakris, Athanasios",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34066007/; https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines9050497,359
684485,"Understanding how Victoria, Australia gained control of its second COVID-19 wave",2021-04-07,"The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly escalated to a global pandemic. To control the rate of transmission, governments advocated that the public practice social distancing, which included staying at home. However, compliance with stay-at-home orders has varied between countries such as China and the United States, and little is known about the mechanisms underlying the national differences. Based on the health belief model, the theory of reasoned action, and the technology acceptance model, health beliefs and behavioral intention are suggested as possible explanations. A total of 498 Chinese and 292 American college students were recruited to complete an online survey. The structural equation modeling results showed that health beliefs (i.e., perceived susceptibility, severity, and barriers) and behavioral intention played multiple mediating roles in the association between nationality and actual stay-at-home behaviors. Notably, the effect via perceived barriers → behavioral intention was stronger than the effects via perceived susceptibility and severity → behavioral intention. That is, American participants perceived high levels of susceptibility whereas Chinese participants perceived high levels of severity, especially few barriers, which further led to increased behavioral intention and more frequent stay-at-home behaviors. These findings not only facilitate a comprehensive understanding of cross-country differences in compliance with stay-at-home orders during peaks in the COVID-19 pandemic but also lend support for mitigation of the current global crisis and future disease prevention and health promotion efforts.","Hong, Wei; Liu, Ru-De; Ding, Yi; Hwang, Jacqueline; Wang, Jia; Yang, Yi",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18042104; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33670078/,359

However, to date, there has been little investigation into the implications of the ‘Telegram’ application for online medical education and training. AIM: This study explores the potential benefits and disadvantages of integrating Telegram into undergraduate medical education during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An exploratory study was conducted between March and May 2020, with 203 undergraduate medical students recruited through purposive sampling. Data was collected through seven open-ended questions, followed by thematic analysis using Atlas.ti. RESULTS: Most students participating in this study reported multiple utilities of the application, including easy access to educational resources and the ability to add unlimited members, as well as files in all formats and sizes. Additionally, the application assisted students to engage with collaborative learning, maintain their wellbeing, and ensure their security. However, they also reported some drawbacks, i.e., a complex interface, information overload, and a tendency to distract them, causing time wastage. CONCLUSION: This study concludes that Telegram provides an effective mobile learning platform for medical students during the current crisis, in particular. Moreover, it offers considerably more functionalities and fewer potential drawbacks than alternative applications.","Iqbal, Muhammad Zafar; Alradhi, Hussain Ibrahim; Alhumaidi, AbdulSalam Abdulkarim; Alshaikh, Khalid Hussni; AlObaid, Abdulraouf Mohammed; Alhashim, Mohammed Taher; AlSheikh, Mona Hmoud",Acta Inform Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32742059/; https://doi.org/10.5455/aim.2020.28.94-97,359
684747,How Local SARS-CoV-2 Prevalence Shapes Pulmonary Function Testing Laboratory Protocols and Practices During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-05-15,"Nanobiosensors are convenient, practical, and sensitive analyzers that detect chemical and biological agents and convert the results into meaningful data between a biologically active molecule and a recognition element immobilized on the surface of the signal transducer by a physicochemical detector. Due to their fast, accurate and reliable operating characteristics, nanobiosensors are widely used in clinical and nonclinical applications, bedside testing, medical textile industry, environmental monitoring, food safety, etc. They play an important role in such critical applications. Therefore, the design of the biosensing interface is essential in determining the performance of the nanobiosensor. The unique chemical and physical properties of nanomaterials have paved the way for new and improved sensing devices in biosensors. The growing demand for devices with improved sensing and selectivity capability, short response time, lower limit of detection, and low cost causes novel investigations on nanobiomaterials to be used as biosensor scaffolds. Among all other nanomaterials, studies on developing nanobiosensors based on metal oxide nanostructures, graphene and its derivatives, carbon nanotubes, and the widespread use of these nanomaterials as a hybrid structure have recently attracted attention. Nanohybrid structures created by combining these nanostructures will directly meet the future biosensors’ needs with their high electrocatalytic activities. This review addressed the recent developments on these nanomaterials and their derivatives, and their use as biosensor scaffolds. We reviewed these popular nanomaterials by evaluating them with comparative studies, tables, and charts.","Aykaç, Ahmet; Gergeroglu, Hazal; Beşli, Büşra; Akkaş, Emine Özge; Yavaş, Ahmet; Güler, Saadet; Güneş, Fethullah; Erol, Mustafa",Nanoscale Res Lett,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33877478/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s11671-021-03519-w,359

Yet we know that the social environment has a dramatic impact on our sense of life satisfaction and well-being. In times of distress, crisis, or disaster, human resilience depends on the richness and strength of social connections, as well as active engagement in groups and communities. Over recent years, evidence emerging from various disciplines has made it abundantly clear: loneliness may be the most potent threat to survival and longevity. Here, we highlight the benefits of social bonds, choreographies of bond creation and maintenance, as well as the neurocognitive basis of social isolation and its deep consequences for mental and physical health.","Bzdok, Danilo; Dunbar, Robin I.M.",Trends Cogn Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32561254/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2020.05.016; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661320301406?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1364661320301406,359

Current evidence on the impact of COVID‐19 in gastroenterology,2021-06-30,"This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of 0.12% chlorhexidine alone and 0.12% chlorhexidine in combination with toothbrushing to prevent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in mechanically ventilated patients. The Embase, Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Literature, PubMed, Scientific Electronic Library Online, Scopus, LIVIVO, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, OpenThesis, and Open Access Thesis and Dissertations databases were used. Only randomized controlled trials without restrictions on the year or language of publication were included. Two reviewers assessed the risk of bias using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Tool. A meta-analysis using a random-effects model estimated the combined relative risk (RR). The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations approach was used to assess the certainty of the evidence. Initially, 2,337 studies were identified, of which 4 were considered in the systematic review and 3 in the meta-analysis (total sample: 796 patients). The studies were published between 2009 and 2017. All eligible studies had a low risk of bias. The meta-analysis revealed that the risk of VAP was 24% lower in patients receiving chlorhexidine combined with toothbrushing than in those receiving chlorhexidine alone (RR: 0.76; 95% confidence interval: 0.55-1.06), with moderate certainty of evidence and without statistical significance. In conclusion, considering the limitations of this study, a standard protocol for the prevention of VAP is not yet recommended. More studies with larger sample sizes are needed to draw strong conclusions. However, considering that toothbrushing is a simple intervention, it should be a common practice in mechanically ventilated patients, especially among patients with coronavirus disease.","Silva, Pedro Urquiza Jayme; Paranhos, Luiz Renato; Meneses-Santos, Daniela; Blumenberg, Cauane; Macedo, Dhiancarlo Rocha; Cardoso, Sérgio Vitorino",Clinics (Sao Paulo),https://doi.org/10.6061/clinics/2021/e2659; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34133659/,359

Currently, there is no commercially available point-of-care diagnostic that is rapid, inexpensive, and highly sensitive for the diagnosis of active tuberculosis disease. Here we describe the development and optimization of a novel, highly sensitive prototype bioelectronic tuberculosis antigen (BETA) assay to detect tuberculosis-specific antigen, CFP10, in small-volume serum and urine samples. In this proof-of-concept study we evaluated the performance of the BETA assay using clinical specimens collected from presumptive tuberculosis patients from three independent cohorts. Circulating CFP10 antigen was detected in ALL serum (n = 19) and urine (n = 3) samples from bacteriologically confirmed tuberculosis patients who were untreated or had less than one week of treatment at time of serum collection, successfully identifying all culture positive tuberculosis patients. No CFP10 antigen was detected in serum (n = 7) or urine (n = 6) samples from individuals who were determined to be negative for tuberculosis disease. Additionally, antigen quantification using the BETA assay of paired serum samples collected from tuberculosis patients (n = 8) both before and after treatment initiation, indicate consistently declining within-person levels of CFP10 antigen during treatment. This novel, low-cost assay demonstrates potential as a rapid, non-sputum-based, point-of-care tool for the diagnosis of tuberculosis disease.","Seifert, Marva; Vargas, Eva; Ruiz-Valdepeñas Montiel, Victor; Wang, Joseph; Rodwell, Timothy C.; Catanzaro, Antonino",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34584117/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-98471-1,359

686508,P-225 A comparison of clinical and pathological TNM staging in a COVID-19 era,2021-07-31,"Dendritic cell‐specific intracellular adhesion molecule‐3‐grabbing nonintegrin (DC‐SIGN) is a member of the C‐type lectin family selectively expressed on immune‐related cells. In the present study, we performed a systematic interaction analysis of DC‐SIGN and its related receptors, DC‐SIGN‐related protein (DC‐SIGNR) and liver and lymph node sinusoidal endothelial cell C‐type lectin (LSECtin) using frontal affinity chromatography (FAC). Carbohydrate‐recognition domains of the lectins, expressed as Fc–fusion chimeras, were immobilized to Protein A–Sepharose and subjected to quantitative FAC analysis using 157 pyridylaminated glycans. Both DC‐SIGN–Fc and DC‐SIGNR–Fc showed similar specificities for glycans containing terminal mannose and fucose, but great difference in affinity under the given experimental conditions. By contrast, LSECtin–Fc showed no affinity to these glycans. As a common feature, the DC‐SIGN‐related lectin–Fc chimeras, including LSECtin, exhibited binding affinity to mono‐ and/or bi‐antennary agalactosylated N‐glycans. The detailed FAC analysis further implied that the presence of terminal GlcNAc at the N‐acetylglucosaminyltransferase I position is a key determinant for the binding of these lectins to agalactosylated N‐glycans. By contrast, none of the lectins showed significant affinity to highly branched agalactosylated N‐glycans. All of the lectins expressed on the cells were able to mediate cellular adhesion to agalactosylated cells and endocytosis of a model glycoprotein, agalactosylated α1‐acid glycoprotein. In this context, we also identified three agalactosylated serum glycoproteins recognized by DC‐SIGN‐Fc (i.e. α‐2‐macroglobulin, serotransferrin and IgG heavy chain), by lectin blotting and MS analysis. Hence, we propose that ‘agalactosylated N‐glycans’ are candidate ligands common to these lectins.","Yabe, Rikio; Tateno, Hiroaki; Hirabayashi, Jun",FEBS J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20840590/; https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-4658.2010.07792.x,359

As specific drugs are either nonexistent, produce secondary effects, or are expensive, a therapeutic possibility is using nonspecific immunostimulants, such as human interferon alpha. We used this drug to treat 27 cats infected by FeLV and 31 infected by FIV. All cats were naturally infected and treatment was administered orally by their owners for four months. Participating cats were evaluated in our clinics at mid-treatment (M2), end of treatment (M4), and 4–8 months after the end of treatment (M10). We observed that treatment was well tolerated by the cats (as it did not affect the liver or the kidney functions), and improved most of the parameters analyzed (clinic, anemia, white cell counts, and CD4+/CD8+ ratio) as long as it was administered. However, 4–8 months after it was discontinued, though most animals remained clinically healthy, many of these parameters had rebounded to initial values or values even worse than the initial values. Thus, more studies should be conducted with longer administration of this drug to evaluate tolerability and sustained improvement of diseases produced by these two viruses which may lead to death. ABSTRACT: Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), two of the most important pathogens of cats, produce chronic systemic diseases with progressive death of cells involved in the immune response, ultimately leading to death. Immunostimulants is one of the few alternatives to the symptomatic treatment. In this study, 27 naturally FeLV-infected (FeLV+) and 31 naturally FIV-infected (FIV+) cats were administered orally by their owners 60 IU/day of recombinant human interferon alpha (rHuIFN-α) for four months in alternate weeks. Clinical status was evaluated and blood samples collected at four different visits or months (M): pretreatment (M0), mid-treatment (M2), end of treatment (M4), and 4–8 months after end of treatment (M10). Most cats ostensibly improved their clinical status, and many became asymptomatic. rHuIFN-α treatment improved the anemic processes observed at M0 (at least in cats with mild or moderate anemia) and leukocyte counts, including a more favorable CD4+/CD8+ ratio. An increase in the serum gammaglobulin concentration was seen in 80% of the cats. Despite observing an obvious favorable progress in the clinical, biopathological, and CD4+/CD8+ values during treatment, almost invariably all the parameters analyzed worsened after treatment discontinuation (M10), which suggests that the interferon-α protocol should be either extended or include additional cycles for a long-lasting benefit in FeLV+ and FIV+ cats.","Gomez-Lucia, Esperanza; Collado, Victorio M.; Miró, Guadalupe; Martín, Sonsoles; Benítez, Laura; Doménech, Ana",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32825496/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani10091464,359

No study has yet looked at the impact of COVID-19 on the surgical research community. In this study, we sought to understand the impact of the pandemic and its associated restrictions on academic surgeons. METHODS: We surveyed members of the Association for Academic Surgery (AAS) and Society of University Surgeons (SUS). Survey questions included demographics, current challenges to basic and clinical research activities, attitudes towards remote work and productivity maintenance, and the solutions implemented to maintain productivity. RESULTS: Of 301 respondents, 70% cited a negative impact on research productivity due to mandatory building shutdowns, minimized personnel due to social distancing, and suspensions of animal work and clinical trials, with senior faculty and division chiefs/chairs more likely to report a negative impact (p=0.001). Only 11% of respondents are documenting their financial losses, and only 19% indicated they received appropriate guidance regarding why and how to monitor the financial impact of the pandemic. Researchers have attempted to maintain research productivity through a focus on remote work, including manuscript writing, grant writing and data analysis. Some participants have found silver linings, including more time to dedicate to research and family due to fewer clinical duties. CONCLUSIONS: Productivity strategies developed during the pandemic, including writing, remote work and meetings, and structured scheduling, are lessons that will allow the surgical research community to be resilient in the face of future disruptions.","Keswani, Sundeep G.; Parikh, Umang M.; Gosain, Ankush; Ghaferi, Amir A.; Thomas, Jayshree S.; Dudeja, Vikas; Kim, Eugene S.; Zuckerbraun, Brian S.; Goldstein, Allan M.",Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.surg.2020.09.012; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0039606020306152; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33077199/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039606020306152?v=s5,359

METHODS: An EDR approach was used to inform a de novo implementation of an LMS during an early clinical rotation of medical students. The EDR consisted of three phases: analysis and exploration; design and construction; and evaluation and reflection. Process and evaluation data (including academic years 2018 and 2019) from two student cohorts (total n = 190, 107 without and 83 with LMS exposure) at one academic teaching hospital were analyzed. RESULTS: Learning theories and concepts of self-regulated learning were used to develop and implement an LMS clerkship prototype. For design and construction, the maturing prototype design included flipped-classroom elements, in-class activation, voluntary digital self-assessments, and clinical teaching videos. For evaluation and reflection, global satisfaction improvement was significant (from 3.9 to 4.4 on a 5-point Likert scale, p < 0.05). There was a positive evaluation trend for all evaluation items related to learning climate, self-regulated learning, and perceived usefulness of the LMS prototype; however, these changes were not statistically significant. The teaching hospital also improved its ranking after the introduction of the LMS prototype. Nearly all students (94%) used the LMS material. The average number of times the LMS course was accessed per student was 70 (range: 7–172), and the average duration students spent online was 58 minutes (range: 9–165). CONCLUSION: Our data indicate that using an EDR approach was helpful for systematically introducing an LMS in a clerkship curriculum informed by learning theory. Our evidence-oriented curriculum reform was associated with higher student satisfaction and appeared to support self-regulated learning in the workplace. Further research should explore which elements of an LMS most effectively help to achieve educational outcomes.","Pinilla, Severin; Cantisani, Andrea; Klöppel, Stefan; Strik, Werner; Nissen, Christoph; Huwendiek, Sören",Adv Med Educ Pract,https://doi.org/10.2147/amep.s284974; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33488137/,359

Many studies have demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of different models of home-based exercise programs in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases and major cardiovascular events among different populations. This body of knowledge can inform evidence-based policies to be urgently implemented to counteract the impact of increased physical inactivity and sedentary behavior during the COVID-19 outbreak, thereby alleviating the global burden of cardiovascular disease.","Peçanha, Tiago; Goessler, Karla Fabiana; Roschel, Hamilton; Gualano, Bruno",Am J Physiol Heart Circ Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.00268.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32412779/,359
687802,Factors Affecting Patient Adherence to Multivitamin Intake After Bariatric Surgery: a Multicentre Survey Study from the Patient’s Perspective,2021-07-25,"BACKGROUND: During the 2020 COVID‐19 pandemic, one of the key components of many countries’ strategies to reduce the spread of the virus is contact tracing. OBJECTIVE: To explore public attitudes to a COVID‐19 contact tracing app in the United Kingdom. SETTING: Online video‐conferencing. PARTICIPANTS: 27 participants, UK residents aged 18 years and older. METHODS: Qualitative study consisting of six focus groups carried out between 1st‐12th May, 2020 (39‐50 days into the UK ‘lockdown’). RESULTS: Participants were divided as to whether or not they felt they would use the app. Analysis revealed five themes: (1) lack of information and misconceptions surrounding COVID‐19 contact tracing apps; (2) concerns over privacy; (3) concerns over stigma; (4)concerns over uptake; and (5) contact tracing as the ‘greater good’. Concerns over privacy, uptake and stigma were particularly significant amongst those stated they will not be using the app, and the view that the app is for the ‘greater good’ was particularly significant amongst those who stated they will be using the app. One of the most common misconceptions about the app was that it could allow users to specifically identify and map COVID‐19 cases amongst their contacts and in their vicinity. CONCLUSIONS: Our participants were torn over whether digital contact tracing is a good idea or not, and views were heavily influenced by moral reasoning. PATIENT OR PUBLIC CONTRIBUTION: No patients were involved in this study. The public were not involved in the development of the research questions, research design or outcome measures. A pilot focus group with participants not included in the present paper was used to help test and refine the focus group questions. Summary results were disseminated via email to participants prior to publication for feedback and comment.","Williams, Simon N.; Armitage, Christopher J.; Tampe, Tova; Dienes, Kimberly",Health Expect,https://doi.org/10.1111/hex.13179; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33434404/,359
688628,Worldwide inverse correlation between Bacille Calmette-Guérin immunization and COVID-19 morbidity and mortality,2020-07-16,"The renin–angiotensin system (RAS) is a complex network that regulates blood pressure, electrolyte and fluid homeostasis, as well as the function of several organs. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as an enzyme that negatively regulates the RAS by converting Ang II, the main bioactive molecule of the RAS, to Ang 1–7. Thus, ACE2 counteracts the role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) which generates Ang II from Ang I. ACE and ACE2 have been implicated in several pathologies such as cardiovascular and renal disease or acute lung injury. In addition, ACE2 has functions independent of the RAS: ACE2 is the receptor for the SARS coronavirus and ACE2 is essential for expression of neutral amino acid transporters in the gut. In this context, ACE2 modulates innate immunity and influences the composition of the gut microbiota, which can explain diarrhea and intestinal inflammation observed in Hartnup disorder, Pellagra, or under conditions of severe malnutrition. Here we review and discuss the diverse functions of ACE2 and its relevance to human pathologies.","Perlot, Thomas; Penninger, Josef M.",Microbes Infect,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S128645791300155X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23962453/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micinf.2013.08.003; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S128645791300155X,359
688659,Communicating with patients and the public about COVID‐19 vaccine safety: recommendations from the Collaboration on Social Science and Immunisation,2021-06-16,"Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has prompted pediatric residency programs to adjust the delivery of educational curricula and to update content relevant to the pandemic. Objective: In this descriptive paper, we present how we rapidly developed and implemented a COVID-19 pandemic elective for pediatric residents. Methods: This curriculum was established at a single tertiary care children’s hospital in June 2020. We used the ADDIE (analysis, design, development, implementation, evaluation) framework to develop a two-week elective (30 hours) consisting of six flexibly scheduled modules. We administered post-elective surveys and exit interviews to solicit feedback to improve the elective and obtain effectiveness of our educational interventions. Results: We developed an asynchronous online COVID-19 Elective for Pediatric Residents. The curriculum modules focus on pathophysiology of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the disaster management ecosystem, simulation of clinical care, mental health ramifications, and public health consequences. We also include six in-situ experiences (visits to a drive-through COVID-19 testing site, testing laboratory and local public health department, a simulation of a critically ill child, and meetings with emergency managers and social workers) to solidify learning and allow for further reflection. To date, eight participants have taken the elective. All participants strongly agreed on a five-point Likert item survey that the elective enhanced their knowledge in current evidence-based literature for COVID-19, disaster preparedness, hospital response, management of the critically ill child, and mental and public health ramifications. All participants agreed this curriculum was relevant to and will change their practice. Conclusions: We demonstrate how a COVID-19 elective for pediatric residents could be quickly developed and implemented. The pilot results show that pediatric trainees value asynchronous learning, supplemented by relevant in-situ experiences. Moreover, these results suggest that this curriculum provides needed disaster response and resiliency education for pediatric residents.","Iyer, Maya S; Lo, Charmaine B; Scherzer, Daniel J; MacDowell, Doug; Gupta, Nita; McManus, Ellen; Stewart, Claire; Linakis, Seth W; Stanley, Rachel",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.13085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33680625/,359
688955,Theoretical novel COVID-19 vaccination risk of rare and severe adverse events versus COVID-19 mortality,2020-10-01,"There is evidence that adoption of non-pharmaceutical containment measures (NPMs) may have had a major impact on Covid-19 epidemic dynamics, and mitigated its effect on healthcare system. Optimal timing of implementation of these measures however is not known. In Italy, a national lockdown was decided on March 11(th) 2020 and ended 4(th) of May. At that time, cumulative incidence (CI) was different in Italian regions which ranged from <5 cases/100,000 to >11 cases/100,000 inhabitants. In this paper, we aim to evaluate how level of incidence in different regions at the time of implementation of NPMs affected CI and had an impact on the healthcare system in terms of ICU bed occupancy and mortality rates. We used regional daily new COVID-19 diagnosed cases as well number of people hospitalized in ICU and number of deaths for period February 24-May 11 from all the 19 Italian regions and two autonomous provinces. For each region we calculated: temporal daily trend of cumulative cases of Covid-19/100,000 inhabitants, daily trend of ICU bed occupancy and mortality rate at the end of period. We found that the epidemic curves show similar trends for all regions and all tend to flatten between 11–32 days. However, after 2 months, regions with lower CI at lockdown remained at substantially lower CI (<265 cases/100,000), had a peak of percentage of cases hospitalized in ICU which did not exceed 79.4% and a mortality<0.27/1,000. On the other hand, in regions with higher incidence at lockdown, CI reached 382–921 cases/100,000, the peak of percentage of cases hospitalized in ICU and mortality rate reached 270%, and 1.5/1,000, respectively. Our data suggests that level of CI at the moment of lockdown is important to control the subsequent spread of infection so NPMs should be adopted very early during the course of Covid-19 epidemic, in order to mitigate the impact on the healthcare system and to reduce related mortality.","Timelli, Laura; Girardi, Enrico",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33513157/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0245656,359

690195,Managing patients with cancer in the COVID-19 era,2020-04-11,"Testing is a crucial control mechanism in the beginning phase of an epidemic when the vaccines are not yet available. It enables the public health authority to detect and isolate the infected cases from the population, thereby limiting the disease transmission to susceptible people. However, despite the significance of testing in epidemic control, the recent literature on the subject lacks a control-theoretic perspective. In this paper, an epidemic model is proposed that incorporates the testing rate as a control input and differentiates the undetected infected from the detected infected cases, who are assumed to be removed from the disease spreading process in the population. After estimating the model on the data corresponding to the beginning phase of COVID-19 in France, two testing policies are proposed: the so-called best-effort strategy for testing (BEST) and constant optimal strategy for testing (COST). The BEST policy is a suppression strategy that provides a minimum testing rate that stops the growth of the epidemic when implemented. The COST policy, on the other hand, is a mitigation strategy that provides an optimal value of testing rate minimizing the peak value of the infected population when the total stockpile of tests is limited. Both testing policies are evaluated by their impact on the number of active intensive care unit (ICU) cases and the cumulative number of deaths for the COVID-19 case of France.","Niazi, Muhammad Umar B.; Kibangou, Alain; Canudas-de-Wit, Carlos; Nikitin, Denis; Tumash, Liudmila; Bliman, Pierre-Alexandre",Annu Rev Control,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367578821000742; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1367578821000742,359

People in Asian countries are more susceptible to the negative impacts of climate change and the subsequent environmental exposures because of the high population density, rapid urbanization, and natural geography of the region. The objective of this multidisciplinary collaborative ecological study was to explore the impact of environmental exposures such as temperature (°C), noise (db), humidity (%rh), air conditioning exposure time (hours), and distance traveled to school (km) on the comfort and academic success of school children in Singapore. Analysis of a large dataset from the Singapore National Science Experiment revealed a positive correlation between the distance traveled to school and favorable environmental conditions (moderate temperatures, low noise, low humidity, and higher amount of air conditioning time) and student academic performance. The analysis revealed that the distance traveled between home and school for public school students falls within a larger range than that for independent (private) school students. On average, students traveled farther distances to attend schools of higher academic caliber thereby increasing their exposure to environmental pollution. Student exposure to pollution can be minimized if all schools adhere to higher standards of environmental comfort and standardized academic caliber. If students can attend the school closest to their homes, they can minimize their daily pollution exposure due to traffic/commute, thereby mitigating the resultant negative health consequences.","Periyakoil, Divya; Das, Hari Prasanna; Miller, Clayton; Spanos, Costas J.; Prata, Ndola",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18041843; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33672818/,359

690666,COVID-19: Where Are We Now?,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The trace element selenium (Se) is needed for regular biosynthesis of selenoproteins, which contribute to antioxidative defense systems and affect redox-regulated signaling. Elevated Se intake and selenoprotein expression levels have been associated with impaired hydrogen peroxide-dependent signaling by insulin, leading to hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. The relation of low Se intake with glucose status and carbohydrate metabolism is poorly known. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross sectional analysis among healthy subjects residing in two Chinese counties with different habitual Se intakes was conducted. Fasted glucose levels were related to Se concentrations of 5686 adults by linear regression analysis with Se, body mass index, age, thyroid status, insulin and sex as independent variables. RESULTS: Serum Se correlated strongly and positively with glucose in the Se-deficient population. There was no strong relationship of Se and glucose in the non-deficient population. Overt hypoglycemia (serum glucose < 2.8 mM) was observed in 19.2% of this random sample of subjects in the Se-deficient and in 1.4% of the moderately supplied population, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: An adequate Se supply constitutes an important factor for glucose homeostasis in human subjects. The interaction between Se status and glucose control is not limited to hyperglycemia, but apparently extends to hypoglycemia risk in Se deficiency. This newly identified relationship may be of relevance for the course of severe disease including major trauma, sepsis and COVID-19, where Se deficiency has been associated with mortality risk.","Wang, Yue; Rijntjes, Eddy; Wu, Qian; Lv, Hongjun; Gao, Chuqi; Shi, Bingyin; Schomburg, Lutz",Redox Biol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213231720309149?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.redox.2020.101709; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32905881/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213231720309149,359

It also explored whether racial discrimination moderated the effect of parental stress on psychological distress. Using primary data collected between May 24, 2020, and June 14, 2020, via an online questionnaire, confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation models were conducted on 339 Korean American parents. Results indicated that parental stress and racial discrimination were associated with parental psychological distress. However, when the sample was divided by parental sex, racial discrimination played as a moderator, the interaction of discrimination, and parenting stress was associated with more psychological distress only for mothers. Based on the study results, we recommended that policymakers should consider policies and programs that can reduce racism to make up for the public health crisis associated with COVID-19; clinical practitioners also need to provide appropriate virtual mental/physical health services and interventions that can decrease parental stress and psychological distress amid COVID-19.","Park, Hyejoon; Choi, Shinwoo; Noh, Keeyoon; Hong, Joo Young",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34282523/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-021-01106-4,359
