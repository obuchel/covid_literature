7176,7176,7176,Is Aerosol-Based Transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Possible?,11.339778,13.173235,2014-11-15,"Epidemiological studies have observed that the seasonal peak incidence of influenza virus infection is sometimes separate from the peak incidence of human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV) infection, with the peak incidence of hRSV infection delayed. This is proposed to be due to viral interference, whereby infection with one virus prevents or delays infection with a different virus. We investigated viral interference between hRSV and 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus (A[H1N1]pdm09) in the ferret model. Infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 prevented subsequent infection with hRSV. Infection with hRSV reduced morbidity attributed to infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 but not infection, even when an increased inoculum dose of hRSV was used. Notably, infection with A(H1N1)pdm09 induced higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and immune mediators in the ferret than hRSV. Minimal cross-reactive serological responses or interferon γ–expressing cells were induced by either virus ≥14 days after infection. These data indicate that antigen-independent mechanisms may drive viral interference between unrelated respiratory viruses that can limit subsequent infection or disease.","Chan, Kok Fei; Carolan, Louise A; Korenkov, Daniil; Druce, Julian; McCaw, James; Reading, Patrick C; Barr, Ian G; Laurie, Karen L",J Infect Dis,529,9

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, Georgia USA) was one of many public health organizations that sought to stop this outbreak. This agency deployed almost 2,000 individuals to West Africa during that timeframe. Deployment to these countries exposed these individuals to a wide variety of dangers, stressors, and risks. Being concerned about the at-risk populations in Africa, and also the well-being of its professionals who willingly deployed, the CDC did several things to help safeguard the health, safety, and resilience of these team members before, during, and after deployment. The accompanying special report highlights innovative pre-deployment training initiatives, customized screening processes, and post-deployment outreach efforts intended to protect and support the public health professionals fighting Ebola. Before deploying, the CDC team members were expected to participate in both internally-created and externally-provided trainings. These ranged from pre-deployment briefings, to Preparing for Work Overseas (PFWO) and Public Health Readiness Certificate Program (PHRCP) courses, to Incident Command System (ICS) 100, 200, and 400 courses. A small subset of non-clinical deployers also participated in a three-day training designed in collaboration with the Center for the Study of Traumatic Stress (CSTS; Bethesda, Maryland USA) to train individuals to assess and address the well-being and resilience of themselves and their teammates in the field during a deployment. Participants in this unique training were immersed in a Virtual Reality Environment (VRE) that simulated deployment to one of seven different types of emergencies. The CDC leadership also requested a pre-deployment screening process that helped professionals in the CDC’s Occupational Health Clinic (OHC) determine whether or not individuals were at an increased risk of negative outcomes by participating in a rigorous deployment at that time. When deployers returned from the field, they received personalized invitations to participate in a voluntary, confidential, post-deployment operational debriefing one-on-one or in a group. Implementing these approaches provided more information to clinical decision makers about the readiness of deployers. It provided deployers with a greater awareness of the kinds of challenges they were likely to face in the field. The post-deployment outreach efforts reminded staff that their contributions were appreciated and there were resources available if they needed help processing any of the potentially-traumatizing things they may have experienced.","Klomp, Richard W.; Jones, Laurie; Watanabe, Emi; Thompson, William W.",Prehosp Disaster Med,529,9

Norkurarinol, a lavandulylated flavanone, was isolated from the roots of Sophora flavescens, which has been shown to have anti-inflammatory activity. Norkurarinol suppressed the NF-κB and AP-1 inducible secreted embryonic alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) activity induced by poly(I:C), TLR3 ligand, in THP1-Blue-CD14 cells with IC(50) values of 20.9 μM. Norkurarinol also significantly suppressed the mRNA expression of proinflammatory and adhesive molecules induced by poly(I:C) and rotavirus infection. Pretreatment of norkurarinol blocked the NF-κB and AP-1 signaling pathway and the phosphorylation of MAPKs induced by poly(I:C). On the other hand, norkurarinol increased the level of IRF3 phosphorylation and IFNβ expression in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, norkurarinol inhibited the rotavirus-induced cytopathic effects. These results suggest that norkurarinol can modulate the TLR3-mediated inflammatory responses and rotavirus replication.","Oh, Hyun-Mee; Lee, Seung Woong; Park, Mi Hye; Kim, Mi Hwa; Ryu, Young Bae; Kim, Myo Sun; Kim, Ha-Hyun; Park, Ki Hun; Lee, Woo Song; Park, Su-Jin; Rho, Mun-Chual",J Pharmacol Sci,529,9

Every sensor suffers from this fundamental drawback, which limits its sensitivity, specificity, and longevity. Existing efforts to improve signal-to-noise ratio involve introducing additional steps to reduce nonspecific binding, which increases the cost of the sensor. Conducting polymer-based chemiresistive biosensors can be mechanically flexible, are inexpensive, label-free, and capable of detecting specific biomolecules in complex samples without purification steps, making them very versatile. In this paper, a poly (3,4-ethylenedioxyphene) (PEDOT) and poly (3-thiopheneethanol) (3TE) interpenetrating network on polypropylene–cellulose fabric is used as a platform for a chemiresistive biosensor, and the specific and nonspecific binding events are studied using the Biotin/Avidin and Gliadin/G12-specific complementary binding pairs. We observed that specific binding between these pairs results in a negative ΔR with the addition of the analyte and this response increases with increasing analyte concentration. Nonspecific binding was found to have the opposite response, a positive ΔR upon the addition of analyte was seen in nonspecific binding cases. We further demonstrate the ability of the sensor to detect a targeted protein in a dual-protein analyte solution. The machine-learning classifier, random forest, predicted the presence of Biotin with 75% accuracy in dual-analyte solutions. This capability of distinguishing between specific and nonspecific binding can be a step towards solving the problem of false positives or false negatives to which all biosensors are susceptible.","Smith, Phil M.; Sutradhar, Indorica; Telmer, Maxwell; Magar, Rishikesh; Farimani, Amir Barati; Reeja-Jayan, B.",Sensors (Basel),529,9
22344,22344,22344,Spread of Middle East Respiratory Coronavirus: Genetic versus Epidemiological Data,11.134805,13.316221,2017-05-01,"The efficacy of antibiotics to treat bacterial infections declines rapidly due to antibiotic resistance. This problem has stimulated the development of novel antibiotics, but most attempts have failed. Consequently, the idea of mining uncharacterized genes of pathogens to identify potential targets for entirely new classes of antibiotics was proposed. Without knowing the biochemical function of a protein, it is difficult to validate its potential for drug targeting; therefore, the functional characterization of bacterial proteins of unknown function must be accelerated. Here, we present a paradigm for comprehensively predicting the biochemical functions of a large set of proteins encoded by hypothetical genes in human pathogens to identify candidate drug targets. A high-throughput approach based on homology modelling with ten templates per target protein was applied to the set of 2103 P. aeruginosa proteins encoded by hypothetical genes. The >21000 homology modelling results obtained and available biological and biochemical information about several thousand templates were scrutinized to predict the function of reliably modelled proteins of unknown function. This approach resulted in assigning one or often multiple putative functions to hundreds of enzymes, ligand-binding proteins and transporters. New biochemical functions were predicted for 41 proteins whose essential or virulence-related roles in P. aeruginosa were already experimentally demonstrated. Eleven of them were shortlisted as promising drug targets that participate in essential pathways (maintaining genome and cell wall integrity), virulence-related processes (adhesion, cell motility, host recognition) or antibiotic resistance, which are general drug targets. These proteins are conserved in other WHO priority pathogens but not in humans; therefore, they represent high-potential targets for preclinical studies. These and many more biochemical functions assigned to uncharacterized proteins of P. aeruginosa, made available as PaPUF database, may guide the design of experimental screening of inhibitors, which is a crucial step towards the validation of the highest-potential targets for the development of novel drugs against P. aeruginosa and other high-priority pathogens.","Babic, Nikolina; Kovacic, Filip",PLoS One,529,30

METHOD Using a variety of both web-based and app-based virtual platforms, a nationally accredited fellowship program converted traditional in-seat learning modalities to elearning platforms using both synchronous and asynchronous education. RESULTS Preliminary data indicate that knowledge acquisition and perceived fellow satisfaction are preserved despite the abrupt change to program delivery. Programmatic modifications were submitted to the American Nurse Credentialing Center for compliance and deemed as creative, innovative, and collaborative. CONCLUSION Curriculum for advanced practice fellowship programs can be favorably converted to elearning using virtual platforms during a crisis. Through prompt reevaluation and restructuring, virtual platforms can replace in-seat didactic lectures, patient case studies, mentoring, and even simulation, while ensuring program continuation and compliance with accreditation standards.

METHODS Consecutive patients with biopsy-proven stage I NSCLC underwent computed tomography-guided lung RFA from December 2003 to 2010. All patients were deemed medically inoperable or refused an operation. RFA was performed with curative intent. RESULTS Fifty-five ablations were performed in 45 patients (age, 51 to 89 years) with stage I NSCLC. At a median follow-up of 32 months, LRR occurred in 21 (38%) within a mean of 12±10 (range, 1-44) months from RFA. Recurrence was observed locally in the tumor bed in 18 (33%), in regional nodes in 4 (7%), and distant in 2 (4%). The mean maximal tumor diameter was 2.3±1.3 (range, 0.7 to 4.5) cm. In tumors exceeding 3 cm, 10 (80%) were associated with LRR. Recurrent lesions were treated with repeat RFA (5), radiotherapy (8), chemoradiotherapy (5), and chemotherapy (2). Local control was achieved by repeat RFA in 2 of 5 (40%) or by radiotherapy in 8 lesions (100%), with 2 regional nodal failures (median follow-up, 40±13 months). Overall survival among patients who did or did not experience LRR was similar (32% to 35%). Repeat RFA was not associated with any significant complications or procedure-related 30-day mortality. CONCLUSIONS Lung RFA is associated with increased rates of local failure in tumors exceeding 3 cm and in contact with larger segmental vessels. Patients with local failure can be promptly salvaged with SBRT or repeat RFA, without detriment to overall survival.","Lanuti, Michael; Sharma, Amita; Willers, Henning; Digumarthy, Subba R; Mathisen, Douglas J; Shepard, Jo-Anne O",The Annals of thoracic surgery,529,1

Given the clinical implications and the high prevalence of both disorders, effective interventions are needed. METHODS The aim of this study is to review Behavioural Activation (BA) intervention effects to improve substance use behaviour and depression. A systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO. The Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool (EPHPP) was used to assess the methodological quality of included studies. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, reviewed selected studies, and extracted data. RESULTS Of the 7286 studies identified, eight met inclusion criteria. Designs of the studies included six randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and two pre-post design studies. One trial received weak methodological quality, six moderate, and one strong. Three studies addressed smoking behaviour; two targeted opiate dependence; two focused on alcohol/drug dependence; and, one on crystal methamphetamine abuse. Results showed that BA had a positive effect on substance use outcomes in seven of the eight reviewed studies, and improved depression over time in six studies. CONCLUSIONS Although studies conducted so far are limited by their heterogeneity and sample sizes, results are promising. There is a need of well controlled and powered studies to establish and to confirm the effectiveness of BA for the treatment of substance use and depression. Future studies should include stronger methodological designs, larger sample sizes, and long-term follow-ups.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combined laparoscopic approach in women with symptomatic ""large"" intramural uterine fibroids, compared to the traditional laparoscopic myomectomy alone. METHODS Prospective nonrandomized case-controlled study of women who underwent a conservative surgery for symptomatic ""large"" (≥ 5 cm in the largest diameter) intramural uterine fibroids. The ""study group"" consisted of women who underwent the combined approach (laparoscopic uterine artery bipolar coagulation and simultaneous myomectomy), while women who underwent the traditional laparoscopic myomectomy constituted the ""control group"".

A biohybrid composite material that offers both strength and bioactivity for optimal healing towards native tissue behavior may offer a solution to this problem. A regionally distinct biocomposite scaffold composed of a biodegradable elastomer (poly(ester urethane)urea) and porcine dermal ECM gel was generated to meet this need by a concurrent polymer electrospinning/ECM gel electrospraying technique where the electrosprayed component was varied temporally during the processing. A sandwich structure was achieved with polymer fiber rich upper and lower layers for structural support and an ECM-rich inner layer to encourage cell ingrowth. Increasing the upper and lower layer fiber content predictably increased tensile strength. In a rat full thickness abdominal wall defect model, the sandwich scaffold design maintained its thickness whereas control biohybrid scaffolds lacking the upper and lower fiber-rich regions failed at 8 weeks. Sandwich scaffold implants also showed higher collagen content 4 and 8 weeks after implantation, exhibited an increased M2 macrophage phenotype response at later times and developed biaxial mechanical properties better approximating native tissue. By employing a processing approach that creates a sheet-form scaffold with regionally distinct zones, it was possible to improve biological outcomes in body wall repair and provide the means for further tuning scaffold mechanical parameters when targeting other applications.

Noninvasive ventilation and high-flow nasal oxygen may have a limited role in selected patients under carefully monitored circumstances. Drug therapy exerts only a modest clinical effect and has been poorly studied in the critically ill, though there is some evidence to support the use of neuraminidase inhibitors (NAI) - particularly oseltamivir - as early as possible in this cohort. Newer agents have failed to demonstrate superiority over NAIs but may be useful options if the patient fails to respond or should resistant influenza strains emerge. Steroid therapy, in the absence of another indication, must be recommended against given the repeated trend towards increased mortality in this group. SUMMARY Influenza management is an evolving field of significant interest to any critical care provider. Currently, good respiratory supportive care and early enteral oseltamivir are the best supported treatment strategies. Further study in the intensive care setting will be needed before the use of novel agents can be recommended.","OʼSullivan, Shane; Torres, Antoni; Rodriguez, Alejandro; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio",Current opinion in pulmonary medicine,529,32

Based on automated-CPR porcine data, we have developed an algorithm to support ROSC detection, which detects cardiogenic output during chest compressions via a photoplethysmography (PPG) signal. The algorithm can detect palpable and impalpable spontaneous pulses. A compression-free PPG signal which estimates the spontaneous pulse waveform, was obtained by subtracting the compression component, modeled by a harmonic series. The fundamental frequency of this series was the compression rate derived from the transthoracic impedance signal measured between the defibrillation pads. The amplitudes of the harmonic components were obtained via a least mean-square algorithm. The frequency spectrum of the compression-free PPG signal was estimated via an autoregressive model, and the relationship between the spectral peaks was analyzed to identify the pulse rate (PR). Resumed cardiogenic output could also be detected from a decrease in the baseline of the PPG signal, presumably caused by a redistribution of blood volume to the periphery. The algorithm indicated cardiogenic output when a PR or a redistribution of blood volume was detected. The algorithm indicated cardiogenic output with 94% specificity and 69% sensitivity compared to the retrospective ROSC detection of nine clinicians. Results showed that ROSC detection can be supported by combining the compression-free PPG signal with an indicator based on the detected PR and redistribution of blood volume.","Wijshoff, Ralph W C G R; van Asten, Antoine M T M; Peeters, Wouter H; Bezemer, Rick; Noordergraaf, Gerrit Jan; Mischi, Massimo; Aarts, Ronald M",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,529,1

From 2007 until 2010, a large Q fever outbreak has occurred in the Netherlands. We studied traditional and less common inflammation markers in seronegative and seropositive patients with acute Q fever pneumonia to identify markers that distinguish different disease stages and predict disease severity. METHODS A total of 443 adult patients presenting at the Emergency Department with community-acquired pneumonia were included in a prospective etiologic study. Patients with acute Q fever pneumonia were identified by PCR and/or serology. Patient characteristics, clinical symptoms, pneumonia severity and inflammation markers were assessed upon presentation. Duration of symptoms, prior therapy and length of hospital stay were retrieved from the hospital information system. RESULTS In all, 40 patients with acute Q fever pneumonia were identified. Of these, 29 were seronegative and 11 seropositive at presentation. C-reactive protein (CRP) was the only inflammation marker increased in all seronegative and seropositive patients but no significant difference was observed between groups. In seronegative patients, hypophosphatemia was more common (p=0.01), and length of hospital stay was longer (p=0.02). However, there was no significant difference in pneumonia severity index. Furthermore, phosphate levels were inversely correlated with body temperature (p=0.003). CONCLUSIONS In acute Q fever pneumonia, CRP is the only traditional inflammation marker adequately reflecting disease activity. Patients with seronegative acute Q fever pneumonia present with hypophosphatemia and have prolonged length of hospital stay when compared to seropositive patients, suggesting an increased disease severity.","Vissers, Elle; de Jager, Cornelis P C; Hilbink, Mirrian; Kusters, Ron; van Gageldonk-Lafeber, Arianne B; Wever, Peter C",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,529,14

APPROACH European pandemic preparedness indicators were used to develop an assessment tool and procedure based on the 2005 global WHO checklist for pandemic preparedness. These were then applied to Member States of WHO's European Region, initially as part of structured national assessments conducted during short visits by external teams. LOCAL SETTING Countries in WHO's European Region. RELEVANT CHANGES From 2005 to 2008, 43 countries underwent a pandemic preparedness assessment that included a short external assessment visit by an expert team. These short visits developed into a longer self-assessment procedure involving an external team but ""owned"" by the countries, which identified gaps and developed plans for improving preparedness. The assessment tool and procedure became more sophisticated as national and local pandemic preparedness became more complex. The 2009 pandemic revealed new gaps in planning, surveillance communications and immunization. LESSONS LEARNT Structured national self-assessments with support from external teams allow individual countries to identify gaps in their pandemic preparedness plans and enable regional bodies to assess the regional and global resources that such plans require. The 2009 pandemic revealed additional problems with surveillance, pandemic severity estimates, the flexibility of the response, vaccination, involvement of health-care workers and communication. European national plans are being upgraded and global leadership is required to ensure that these plans are uniformly applied across the region.","Nicoll, Angus; Brown, Caroline; Karcher, Franz; Penttinen, Pasi; Hegermann-Lindencrone, Michala; Villanueva, Silvia; Ciotti, Massimo; Jean-Gilles, Lucie; Rehmet, Sybille; Nguyen-Van-Tam, Jonathan S",Bulletin of the World Health Organization,529,7

However, information on the current utilization of oral anticonceptives and attitudes toward their use remains sparse. OBJECTIVE The present study evaluated the utilization pattern of oral anticonceptives, attitude toward pill use, and incidence of side effects among Saudi women. SETTING The study was conducted in a community setting in Jazan, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. METHODS Eligible Saudi women routinely using oral anticonceptive pills were invited to participate in this prospective, cross-sectional survey. Data were collected using a standardized, pretested, semi-structured questionnaire. Jazan was selected as it recorded the highest number of women using contraceptives in Saudi Arabia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The pattern of pill utilization, attitude toward pill use, and incidence of side effects. RESULTS A total of 496 women consented to participate in this study. Most of the respondents (87.5%) were using or had used oral anticonceptives for birth control. In nearly half (49.2%) of participants, oral pills were advised by a gynaecologist, and approximately two-thirds (69.0%) were using or had used combined oral anticonceptives. Nearly two-thirds (63.1%) of respondents preferred pills over other contraception methods due to their ease of use. More than one-third (39.3%) of participants agreed that oral pills are safe. Approximately half (53.2%) of participants were aware that a missed pill must be taken immediately after recalling that a dose was missed. A total of 69.6% of participants experienced at least one side effect, of which mood swings (61.1%), weight gain or increase appetite (42.2%), decreased libido (34.1%), and nausea (31.2%) were most common. CONCLUSION Saudi women had a high acceptance rate for oral anticonceptives as a legitimate method to prevent unintended pregnancy. This was associated with a modest degree of understanding about their risks and benefits. Pharmacists should provide up-to-date information and counsel patients about the use and side effects of oral anticonceptives.","Yasmeen, Ayesha; Syed, Mamoon H; Meraya, Abdulkarim M; Albarraq, Ahmed A; Makeen, Hafiz A; Alqahtani, Saad S; Abubaker, Mawada; Syed, Nabeel Kashaan A",International journal of clinical pharmacy,529,5

METHODS From 2011 to 2013, nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from Korean children and tested for hMPV on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The genotype of hMPV in each sample was identified on PCR-restriction length polymorphism analysis of the fusion gene. We divided patients into three groups according to degree of fever. Patients with fever peaking at >39.5°C or lasting >7 days were classified as the high fever (HF) group; those with fevers peaking at <38.5°C and lasting <72 h were classified as the low fever (LF) group; and the other subjects were classified as the moderate fever group. RESULTS Among 457 samples positive for hMPV, hMPV genotype was able to be identified in 399 (87.3%); of these, A2a was found in 97 (24.3%), B1 in 186 (46.6%), and B2 in 116 (29.1%). Clinical features of hMPV infection were compared between the HF and LF groups. We classified 80 subjects into the HF group and 84 subjects into the LF group. Mean absolute neutrophil count (5625 ± 4418 vs 4072 ± 3076/μL, P = 0.010) and C-reactive protein (2.39 ± 3.39 vs 0.96 ± 1.77 mg/dL, P = 0.001) were higher in the HF group. Wheezing (5.0% vs 32.1%, P < 0.001) and dyspnea (2.5% vs 15.5%, P = 0.010) were more frequently seen in the LF group. Genotype distribution was similar in the two groups.

A substantial part of this comprises prescriptions in case of non-specific symptoms or asymptomatic bacteriuria, for which the latest guidelines promote restrictiveness with antibiotics. We aim to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use for UTIs through an antibiotic stewardship intervention (ASI) that encourages to prescribe according to these guidelines. To develop an effective ASI, we first need a better understanding of the complex decision-making process concerning suspected UTIs in frail elderly. Moreover, the implementation approach requires tailoring to the heterogeneous elderly care setting. METHODS AND ANALYSIS First, we conduct a qualitative study to explore factors contributing to antibiotic prescribing for UTIs in frail elderly, using semi-structured interviews with general practitioners, nursing staff, patients and informal caregivers. Next, we perform a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial in elderly care organisations. A multifaceted ASI is implemented in the intervention group; the control group receives care as usual. The ASI is centred around a decision tool that promotes restrictive antibiotic use, supported by a toolbox with educational materials. For the implementation, we use a modified participatory-action-research approach, guided by the results of the qualitative study. The primary outcome is the number of antibiotic prescriptions for suspected UTIs. We aim to recruit 34 clusters with in total 680 frail elderly residents ≥70 years. Data collection takes place during a 5-month baseline period and a 7-month follow-up period. Finally, we perform a process evaluation. The study has been delayed for 6 months due to COVID-19 and is expected to end in July 2021.

PTOX derivatives (PTOXs) could arrest the cell cycle, block the transitorily generated DNA/RNA breaks, and blunt the growth-stimulation by targeting topoisomerase II, tubulin, or insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor. Since 1983, etoposide (VP-16) is being used in frontline cancer therapy against various cancer types, such as small cell lung cancer and testicular cancer. Surprisingly, VP-16 (ClinicalTrials NTC04356690) was also redeveloped to treat the cytokine storm in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in phase II in April 2020. The treatment aims at dampening the cytokine storm and is based on etoposide in the case of central nervous system. However, the initial version of PTOX was far from perfect. Almost all podophyllotoxin derivatives, including the FDA-approved drugs VP-16 and teniposide, were seriously limited in clinical therapy due to systemic toxicity, drug resistance, and low bioavailability. To meet this challenge, scientists have devoted continuous efforts to discover new candidate drugs and have developed drug strategies. This review focuses on the current clinical treatment of PTOXs and the prospective analysis for improving druggability in the rational design of new generation PTOX-derived drugs.","Zhao, Wei; Cong, Ying; Li, Hong-Mei; Li, Shengying; Shen, Yuemao; Qi, Qingsheng; Zhang, Youming; Li, Yue-Zhong; Tang, Ya-Jie",Natural product reports,529,33

Low-income and minority populations are likely to experience disparate disease and mental health burdens. Currently, there is little evidence regarding how the experience of the early months of the US COVID-19 outbreak differed by income level, and how that related to mental health symptoms. The present study used data from a national sample of US adults (n = 5023) who completed measures related to the COVID experience, the COVID-19 Fear Scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8). Multivariable regression was performed to determine whether income level (low: <$45,000 vs high: ≥$75,000) was significantly associated with COVID experience measures, PHQ-8, GAD-7, and COVID fear scores. Among the low-income group, COVID-19 had a significantly greater negative impact on: family income/employment, access to food, access to mental health treatment, and stress and discord in the family. Participants in the low-income group also had greater odds of a PHQ-8 score ≥10 (odds ratio [OR] = 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.08, 1.77) and a GAD-7 score ≥10 (OR = 1.65, 95% CI 1.27, 2.14) compared to those in the high-income group.

OBJECTIVE To determine clinical outcomes and staff and patient satisfaction with a novel telehospitalist program among Veterans Health Administration (VHA) hospitals. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We conducted a mixed-methods evaluation of a quality improvement program with pre-and postimplementation measures. The hub site was a tertiary (high-complexity) VHA hospital, and the spoke site was a 10-bed inpatient medical unit at a rural (low-complexity) VHA hospital. All patients admitted during the study period were assigned to the spoke site. INTERVENTION Real-time videoconferencing was used to connect a remote hospitalist physician with an on-site advanced practice provider and patients. Encounters were documented in the electronic health record. MAIN OUTCOMES Process measures included workload, patient encounters, and daily census. Outcome measures included length of stay (LOS), readmission rate, mortality, and satisfaction of providers, staff, and patients. Surveys measured satisfaction. Qualitative analysis included unstructured and semi-structured interviews with spoke-site staff. RESULTS Telehospitalist program implementation led to a significant reduction in LOS (3.0 [SD, 0.7] days vs 2.3 [SD, 0.3] days). The readmission rate was slightly higher in the telehospitalist group, with no change in mortality rate. Satisfaction among teleproviders was very high. Hub staff perceived the service as valuable, though satisfaction with the program was mixed. Technology and communication challenges were identified, but patient satisfaction remained mostly unchanged. CONCLUSION Telehospitalist programs are a feasible and safe way to provide inpatient coverage and address rural hospital staffing needs. Ensuring adequate technological quality and addressing staff concerns in a timely manner can enhance program performance.","Gutierrez, Jeydith; Moeckli, Jane; Holcombe, Andrea; O'Shea, Amy Mj; Bailey, George; Rewerts, Kelby; Hagiwara, Mariko; Sullivan, Steven; Simon, Melissa; Kaboli, Peter",Journal of hospital medicine,529,17

METHODS Patients treated in MR CLEAN Registry centers with CS or LA as preferred anesthetic approach during EVT for ischemic stroke were analyzed. First, we evaluated the effect of CS on area under the threshold (AUT), relative difference between baseline and lowest procedural mean arterial pressure (∆LMAP) and procedural blood pressure trend, compared to LA. Second, we assessed the association between blood pressure and functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale, mRS) with multivariable regression. Lastly, we evaluated whether blood pressure explained the effect of CS on mRS. RESULTS In 440 patients with available blood pressure data, patients treated under CS (n = 262) had larger AUTs (median 228 vs 23 mm Hg*min), larger ∆LMAP (median 16% vs 6%) and a more negative blood pressure trend (-0.22 vs -0.08 mm Hg/min) compared to LA (n = 178). Larger ∆LMAP and AUTs were associated with worse mRS (adjusted common OR (acOR) per 10%-drop 0.87, 95%CI 0.78-0.97, and acOR per 300 mm Hg*min 0.89, 95%CI 0.82-0.97).

CONCLUSIONS Large blood pressure drops are associated with worse functional outcome.

In particular, to establish a way forward in the assessment of NIRS instrumentation for future randomized trials, a systematic literature search is performed. The records are screened and abstracts are assessed to select studies fulfilling our inclusion criteria. Twenty-two pediatric and 28 adult studies are analyzed after exclusion of three articles in each group. All studies compare regional cerebral tissue oxygenation measured by cerebral NIRS to invasive measurement of central or jugular venous oxygen saturation. In studies without Bland-Altman plots, we extracted data from scatter plots enabling estimation of mean difference (MD), standard deviation (SD), and limits of agreement (LOA). To assess the agreement between rStO 2 (regional cerebral tissue oxygenation) estimated by NIRS and by blood samples, weighted averages of the MDs and SDs from each study are calculated. We found a fair agreement between the overall mean of cerebral tissue oxygenation and the mean of a reference value measured by co-oximetry whatever NIRS instrument or site of blood sampling used. Cerebral oxygenation overestimates the reference at low values, some instruments apparently more than others. Thus, a high degree of scatter and a lack of a good reference method complicate in vivo validation of NIRS. It is difficult to draw any firm conclusions despite the large number of studies, and the result of this review leaves us questioning if more of such validation studies of cerebral NIRS oximetry are really needed. Furthermore, the combination of lack of validation and poor repeatability is an important issue when designing a randomized clinical trial of implementing cerebral NIRS oximetry into clinical care.","la Cour, Amalie; Greisen, Gorm; Hyttel-Sorensen, Simon",Neurophotonics,529,24

Univariate statistics revealed substantial differences in race-related bias and hatred by race, experienced during students' lifetime as well as since the onset of COVID-19. Results of multinomial logistic regression showed that the odds of having experienced bias or hatred during their lifetime were significantly higher (P < .05) for the Black students than for White students (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 75.8, for very often or often vs never; AOR = 42 for sometimes vs never). Compared with White students, the odds of hatred and bias were also significantly higher for students who were Asian, multiple races, or another non-White race. The odds of having experienced race-related bias and hatred since the onset of COVID-19 were also higher for Black Asian, multiple races, and other non-White students. CONCLUSIONS This study adds critical scientific evidence about variation in the perception of bias and hatred that should draw policy attention to race-related issues experienced by college students in the United States.","Shah, Gulzar H; Rochani, Haresh D; Telfair, Joseph; Ayangunna, Elizabeth; Skuraton, Gemma",Journal of public health management and practice : JPHMP,529,26

OBJECTIVE We report the initial multicenter experience with a novel technique for the minimally invasive evacuation of ICH using the Penumbra Apollo system (Penumbra Inc, Alameda, California). METHODS Institutional databases were queried to perform a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent ICH evacuation with the Apollo system from May 2014 to September 2014 at 4 centers (Medical University of South Carolina, Stony Brook University, University of California at San Diego, and Semmes-Murphy Clinic). Cases were performed either in the neurointerventional suite, operating room, or in a hybrid operating room/angiography suite. RESULTS Twenty-nine patients (15 female; mean age, 62 ± 12.6 years) underwent the minimally invasive evacuation of ICH. Six of these parenchymal hemorrhages had an additional intraventricular hemorrhage component. The mean volume of ICH was 45.4 ± 30.8 mL, which decreased to 21.8 ± 23.6 mL after evacuation (mean, 54.1 ± 39.1% reduction; P < .001). Two complications directly attributed to the evacuation attempt were encountered (6.9%). The mortality rate was 13.8% (n = 4). CONCLUSION Minimally invasive evacuation of ICH and intraventricular hemorrhage can be achieved with the Apollo system. Future work will be required to determine which subset of patients are most likely to benefit from this promising technology.","Spiotta, Alejandro M; Fiorella, David; Vargas, Jan; Khalessi, Alexander; Hoit, Dan; Arthur, Adam; Lena, Jonathan; Turk, Aquilla S; Chaudry, M Imran; Gutman, Frederick; Davis, Raphael; Chesler, David A; Turner, Raymond D",Neurosurgery,529,30

OBJECTIVES We aimed to rapidly implement enterprise text messaging as a crisis communication intervention to deliver key COVID-related safety and practice information directly to hospital employees. METHODS Utilizing a secure text-messaging platform already routinely used in direct patient care, we sent 140-character messages containing targeted pandemic-related updates to on-duty hospital employees three times per week for 13 weeks. This innovation was evaluated through the analysis of aggregate ""read"" receipts from each message. Effectiveness was assessed by rates of occupational exposures to COVID-19 and by two cross-sectional attitudinal surveys administered to all text-message recipients. RESULTS On average, each enterprise text message was sent to 1,997 on-duty employees. Analysis of ""read"" receipts revealed that on average, 60% of messages were consistently read within 24 hours of delivery, 34% were read in 2 hours, and 16% were read in 10 minutes. Readership peaked and fell in the first week of messaging but remained consistent throughout the remainder of the intervention. A survey administered after 2 weeks revealed that 163 (79%) users found enterprise texts ""valuable,"" 152 (73%) users would recommend these texts to their colleagues, and 114 (55%) users preferred texts to email. A second survey at 9 weeks revealed that 109 (80%) users continued to find texts ""valuable."" Enterprise messaging, in conjunction with the system's larger communication strategy, was associated with a decrease in median daily occupational exposure events (nine events per day premessaging versus one event per day during messaging). CONCLUSION Enterprise text messages sent to hospital-employee smartphones are an efficient and effective strategy for urgent communications. Hospitals may wish to leverage this technology during times of routine operations and crisis management.","Williams, Cheyenne; Rao, Aditi; Ziemba, Justin B; Myers, Jennifer S; Patel, Neha",Applied clinical informatics,529,1

Vaccines and antiviral medications are still under trial to prevent or treat infections of human coronavirus (HCoV) till date. The virus HCoV originate in 2003, SARS-CoV, which causes respiratory syndrome having distinctive pathogenesis and causes infections of the respiratory tract. A mechanism was projected for the evolution of SARS virus and a handy association with bats was found. When this virus reaches respective host system, infection starts with spike protein binding to its complementary receptor of the host cell. The coronavirus spike protein's association with its host cell receptor complement is crucial in deciding the virus infectivity, tissue tropism and species variety. Recent studies show that SARS Coronavirus 2 or COVID-19 requires protease to get into cells, offering a new therapeutic target. Distinctive attention and exertions should be given to defending or reducing transmission in vulnerable populaces, including those directly associated with caregiving and treatment and also aged one. Researchers are planning to develop a vaccine for COVID-19 and in this approach are also considered developing a vaccine that sensitizes our immune system preventing from this pandemic.

METHODS This is a retrospective case-control study. Forty-four patients were divided into two groups: two-port (5 mm and 10 mm) laparoscopic surgery group (n: 22) and conventional multiport (three/four port) laparoscopic surgery group (n: 22), with similar indications. All procedures, except ovarian detorsions, included salpingectomy, oophorectomy or salpingo-ophorectomy. The groups were evaluated using their demographic, clinical, intraoperative and postoperative data, and survey questions that were asked were used for analyzing cosmetic satisfaction, surgical satisfaction and preference rates of the TPLS. RESULTS There were no significant differences between the groups on demographic features. All patients were discharged within 24 h after both the procedures without any major (organ injury) or minor complication. Surgical satisfaction range was 8.82 (±1.01) in TPLS group and 7.27 (±1.6) in the CMLS group, and differences were significant (P = 0.002). Satisfaction with cosmesis was 95% in the TPLS group and 77% in the CMLS group, and this difference was not significant (P = 0.11). The preferences rate of TPLS was 68% among the 44 women. CONCLUSION Novel TPLS is feasible and safe in expert hands. In addition, it provides more surgical satisfaction to patients. However, there were not significant differences in long-term cosmesis results between the TPLS and CMLS groups.","Bağlı, İhsan; Bademkıran, Hanifi",The journal of obstetrics and gynaecology research,529,19

Most concepts achieve their high ORR activity by increasing the Pt specific activity at the expense of a lower electrochemically active surface area (ECSA). In the potential region controlled by kinetics, such a lower ECSA is counterbalanced by the high specific activity. At higher overpotentials, however, which are often applied in real systems, a low ECSA leads to limitations in the reaction rate not by kinetics, but by mass transport. Here we report on self-supported platinum-cobalt oxide networks that combine a high specific activity with a high ECSA. The high ECSA is achieved by a platinum-cobalt oxide bone nanostructure that exhibits unprecedentedly high mass activity for self-supported ORR catalysts. This concept promises a stable fuel-cell operation at high temperature, high current density and low humidification.","Sievers, Gustav W; Jensen, Anders W; Quinson, Jonathan; Zana, Alessandro; Bizzotto, Francesco; Oezaslan, Mehtap; Dworzak, Alexandra; Kirkensgaard, Jacob J K; Smitshuysen, Thomas E L; Kadkhodazadeh, Shima; Juelsholt, Mikkel; Jensen, Kirsten M Ø; Anklam, Kirsten; Wan, Hao; Schäfer, Jan; Čépe, Klára; Escudero-Escribano, María; Rossmeisl, Jan; Quade, Antje; Brüser, Volker; Arenz, Matthias",Nature materials,529,7

Because unintended hypothermia has significant consequences, there is a need for more effective warming strategies. The effectiveness of warming technologies that apply heat through the skin is based on surface-area contact with the heat source and the duration of pre-warming. Therefore, we sought to test the therapeutic effectiveness of combined above- and below-warming therapies. Our hospital prohibits forced-air warming before the patient is draped, so a secondary goal was to determine the effect of preoperative warming using a system that does not interfere with airflow in the operating room. METHODS We prospectively randomized 35 patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty into two groups: 1) forced-air warming/water mattress, using both WarmTouch® upper-body forced-air warming (Medtronic/Covidien Inc., Dublin, Ireland) and a Norm-O-Temp® underbody water mattress (CSZ/Gentherm Inc., Cincinnati, OH, USA), and 2) conductive fabric warming, using a HotDog® electric upper-body blanket (Augustine Temperature Management LLC, Eden Prairie, MN, USA) and a HotDog® underbody mattress. RESULTS Throughout the surgical procedure, group 2 patients had significantly higher temperatures; this group experienced superior pre-warming during preoperative preparations and thus the redistribution temperature drop following the induction of anesthesia was reduced. Both groups achieved 100% normothermia by the end of surgery. CONCLUSION Based solely on the temperatures at the end of surgery, these data indicate that forced-air warming in conjunction with a water mattress warming system is as effective as a conductive fabric electric warming system alone.","Ohki, Kenji; Kawano, Rumi; Yoshida, Mitsuyoshi; Kanosue, Ikuyo; Yamamoto, Kohki",Surgical technology international,529,20

Two types of coronavirus-based expression vectors have been developed; one is helper-dependent expression system and the other a single genome-based expression system. By modification of the infectious cDNA of the genome of coronaviruse, it has led to an efficient (> 50 microg/10(6)cells) and stable (> 30 passages) expression of the foreign gene. Moreover,several other features of coronavirus make it attractive as a vector. Firstly, the virulent coronaviruse can be converted into nonvirulent viruse by deleting the nonessential, group-specific genes. Secondly, the species and tissue tropism of coronaviruses can be manipulated by modification of their attachment and fusion protein S. Thus, coronavirus-based vector is becoming a promising and useful tool for vaccine development and gene delivery.","Yang, Yang; Tan, Wen-Jie",Bing du xue bao = Chinese journal of virology,529,1

The inconsistencies reflect contradictory conclusions from independent clinical-based studies that took roughly similar approaches, in terms of experimental design (retrospective, cohort-based, etc.) and statistical analyses (propensity-score matching and stratification, etc.). The confusion has significant ramifications in choosing therapeutic interventions: e.g., do potential benefits of famotidine indicate its use in a particular COVID-19 case? Beyond this pressing therapeutic issue, conflicting information on famotidine must be resolved before its integration in ontological and knowledge graph-based frameworks, which in turn are useful in drug repurposing efforts. To begin systematically structuring the rapidly accumulating information, in the hopes of clarifying and reconciling the discrepancies, we consider the contradictory information along three proposed 'axes': (1) a context-of-disease axis, (2) a degree-of-[therapeutic]-benefit axis, and (3) a mechanism-of-action axis. We suspect that incongruencies in how these axes have been (implicitly) treated in past studies has led to the contradictory indications for famotidine and COVID-19. We also trace the evolution of information on acid-suppression agents as regards the transmission, severity, and mortality of COVID-19, given the many literature reports that have accumulated. By grouping the studies conceptually and thematically, we identify three eras in the progression of our understanding of famotidine and COVID-19. Harmonizing these findings is a key goal for both clinical standards-of-care (COVID and beyond) as well as ontological and knowledge graph-based approaches.","Mura, Cameron; Preissner, Saskia; Preissner, Robert; Bourne, Philip E.",,529,16

Hence, we devised a multiplex reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (mRT-LAMP) coupled with a nanoparticle-based lateral flow biosensor (LFB) assay (mRT-LAMP-LFB) for diagnosing COVID-19. Using two LAMP primer sets, the ORF1ab (opening reading frame 1a/b) and N (nucleoprotein) genes of SARS-CoV-2 were simultaneously amplified in a single-tube reaction, and detected with the diagnosis results easily interpreted by LFB. In presence of FITC (fluorescein)-/digoxin- and biotin-labeled primers, mRT-LAMP produced numerous FITC-/digoxin- and biotin-attached duplex amplicons, which were determined by LFB through immunoreactions (FITC/digoxin on the duplex and anti-FITC/digoxin on the test line of LFB) and biotin/treptavidin interaction (biotin on the duplex and strptavidin on the polymerase nanoparticle). The accumulation of nanoparticles leaded a characteristic crimson band, enabling multiplex analysis of ORF1ab and N gene without instrumentation. The limit of detection (LoD) of COVID-19 mRT-LAMP-LFB was 12 copies (for each detection target) per reaction, and no cross-reactivity was generated from non-SARS-CoV-2 templates. The analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 was 100% (33/33 oropharynx swab samples collected from COVID-19 patients), and the assay's specificity was also 100% (96/96 oropharynx swab samples collected from non-COVID-19 patients). The total diagnostic test can be completed within 1 h from sample collection to result interpretation. In sum, the COVID-19 mRT-LAMP-LFB assay is a promising tool for diagnosing SARS-CoV-2 infections in frontline public health field and clinical laboratories, especially from resource-poor regions.","Zhu, Xiong; Wang, Xiaoxia; Han, Limei; Chen, Ting; Wang, Licheng; Li, Huan; Li, Sha; He, Lvfen; Fu, Xiaoying; Chen, Shaojin; Xing, Mei; Chen, Hai; Wang, Yi",Biosens Bioelectron,529,16

Recent years have witnessed an increase in the use of optical devices for the analysis of body fluids. Several groups have carried out studies investigating the potential of saliva as a non-invasive and reliable clinical specimen for use in medical diagnostics. This brief review aims to highlight the optical technologies, mainly surface plasmon resonance (SPR), Raman, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, which are being used for the probing of saliva for diverse biomedical applications.

Populations with less interest in vaccination were quickly considered vaccine hesitant, and public health campaigns have primarily, and understandably, focused on reaching persons anxious about vaccine safety, vaccine-related adverse effects, or both. But while vaccine anxiety is an important hurdle to overcome, the assumption that all segments of the population with low interest in vaccination are hesitant is a misconception. Vaccine apathy exists across socioeconomic groups. The size of vaccine-apathetic populations is difficult to determine for the same reasons that voting polls can be unreliable. Because antivaccine populations have high decision involvement on this issue, the peripheral messages that can persuade those who are apathetic about COVID-19 vaccines will not be effective in addressing these high-involvement negative groups. These 2 populations should not be considered concurrently when designing vaccine promotion campaigns.","Wood, Stacy PhD Schulman Kevin M. D.",JAMA,529,24

We call such models as population migration models and migration epidemics models, respectively. We first apply the theories of positive operators and positive semigroups to make systematic investigation to asymptotic behavior of solutions of the population migration models as time goes to infinity, and next use such results to study asymptotic behavior of solutions of the migration epidemics models as time goes to infinity. Some interesting properties of solutions of these models are obtained.","Cui, Shangbin; Bai, Meng",,529,20

The results show high filtration efficiency of FFP2, FFP3, and certified surgical masks for all sizes of tested particles, while protection efficiency of washable masks depends on their constituent fabrics. Measurements showed decreasing PRE of all masks over time due to transmission of nanoparticles through the mask-face interface.

The long-term impact of COVID-19 myocarditis and coronary microthrombosis which has also been described and the best therapies for these complications remain unknown. Indeed, monomorphic ventricular tachycardia and regular ventricular arrhythmias have previously been found to be more common in those recovered from myocarditis than in acute myocarditis itself. Follow-up assessment of cardiac function has been suggested for this cohort to detect and possibly prevent further cardiac events in the rehabilitation phase. Functional capacity has been shown to be a better determinant of long-term morbidity than diagnostic testing alone, but integrated approach is likely the way forward in clinical follow-up.

This included evaluating effectiveness of MI interventions within this population and reporting the methodology used, including theoretical underpinnings and identification of BC and MI techniques. Eight databases were searched using controlled vocabulary. Eligible studies included adults with obesity (BMI &#8805;30 kg/m2 ), author-reported interventions using MI aiming to reduce body weight or BMI, and comparator groups not receiving an MI intervention. Data extraction and quality appraisal tools were used to identify study characteristics, intervention content was coded for techniques, and random-effects meta-analysis were conducted to investigate effects. Meta-analysis of 12 studies indicated no overall pooled effect on bodyweight and BMI outcomes between intervention and control groups (SMD = -0.01 [95%CI -0.13 to 0.12, P = .93]). Findings were limited by multiple sources accounting for risk of bias, and poor reporting of intervention fidelity and content. Intervention and control content descriptions indicated similar techniques, with social support, goal setting (behaviour) and self-monitoring of behaviour occurring most frequently across both. Findings do not contribute additional evidence for MI use in this context, however methodological limitations were identified which must be resolved to better identify the intervention effects on obesity-related outcomes.","Makin, Harriet; Chisholm, Anna; Fallon, Victoria; Goodwin, Laura",Clin Obes,529,16

Within the realm of surgical training, the resultant reduction in clinical exposure and case volume jeopardizes the quality of surgical training. Thus, our general surgery residency program proceeded to develop a tailored approach to training that mitigates impact on resident surgical education and optimizes clinical exposure without compromising safety. Residents were engaged directly in planning efforts to craft a response to the pandemic. Following the elimination of elective cases, the in-house resident complement was effectively decreased to reduce unnecessary exposure, with a back-up pool to address unanticipated absences and needs. Personal protective equipment availability and supply, the greatest concern to residents, has remained adequate, while being utilized according to current guidelines. Interested residents were given the opportunity to work in designated COVID ICUs on a volunteer basis. With the decrease in operative volume and clinical duties, we shifted our educational focus to an intensive didactic schedule using a teleconferencing platform and targeted areas of weakness on prior in-service exams. We also highlighted critical COVID-19 literature in a weekly journal club to better understand this novel disease and its effect on surgical practice. The long-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on resident education remains to be seen. Success may be achieved with commitment to constant needs assessment in the changing landscape of healthcare with the goal of producing a skilled surgical workforce for public service.","Adesoye, T; Davis, C H; Del Calvo, H; Shaikh, A F; Chegireddy, V; Chan, E Y; Martinez, S; Pei, K Y; Zheng, F; Tariq, N",J. surg. educ,529,16

As location-based games (LBGs) have been found to influence human movement, their role during COVID-19 deserves closer inspection. Under regular circumstances, the very aim of these games is to motivate people to go out, explore and meet other people. However, during COVID-19, people were advised to do the exact opposite. To study how LBG developers and players reacted to the situation, we used the netnography research method utilizing three types of data: (1) COVID-19 related in-game changes made by seven popular LBG developers during March 2020; (2) social media reactions on 20 posts across three popular Pokémon GO subreddits; and (3) the raiding activity (collaborative play) in Pokémon GO in a Finnish municipality during February–May 2020. All observed LBGs made in-game changes due to COVID-19. The social media reactions showed overwhelming appreciation towards these changes, and two central second order themes arose: (1) LBGs have the ability to influence human movement during pandemics; and (2) people should be able to self-regulate their behaviour during COVID-19 independent of LBG influence. Surprisingly, recorded Pokémon GO player activity in Finland was more influenced by offered in-game rewards than the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings have implications on how games and gamification can be used to direct human movement in situations such as COVID-19 where population-level interventions are needed.","Laato, Samuli; Laine, Teemu H.; Najmul Islam, A.K.M.",Multimodal Tech.

The NiAl content was kept constant and seven compositions of Cr-Mo were tested, namely, 40Cr-0Mo, 30Cr-10Mo, 25Cr-15Mo, 20Cr-20Mo, 15Cr-25Mo, 10Cr-30Mo, and 0Cr-40Mo. It was observed that most of the systems contained primary phases, eutectic microconstituents, and, occasionally, intermetallic phases as the outcome of peritectic reactions. The extent and the nature of all these microstructural features was proved to be affected by the Cr/Mo relative ratio, and an attempt was conducted in order to explain the microstructural features based on solidification and other related phenomena. It was observed that the increase of the relative Mo/Cr ratio led to a significant restriction/elimination of the eutectic microconstituent. The sliding wear response of the produced system seems to diverge from the classical sliding wear laws of Archard and is based on multiple factors such as the nature of the oxide phases being formed upon sliding, the nature and the extend of the intermetallic phases being formed upon solidification, and the integrity and rigidity of the primary phases-last to solidify areas interfacial region and the factors that may influence this integrity.","Mathiou, Christina; Giorspyros, Konstantinos; Georgatis, Emmanuel; Poulia, Anthoula; Karantzalis, Alexander E",,529,16

This study aimed to explore the prevalence of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) among HCWs during the COVID-19 epidemic and investigate the associations among negative coping, fatigue and PTSS. A total of 507 HCWs from Anhui province enrolled in the study and completed the cross-sectional survey including demographic data, Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire (SCSQ), 14-item Fatigue Scale (FS-14), and PTSD Checklist-civilian Version (PCL-C). Univariate linear regression, Pearson correlation and Mackinnon's four-step procedure were performed in the statistical analysis. Results indicated that the prevalence of PTSS among HCWs during the pandemic was 24%. Univariate linear regression showed HCWs aged 31-40 years exhibited significantly higher scores of PTSS than those aged 51-60 (ß = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.59 to 9.41). Having at least one child was associated with a higher risk of developing PTSS (ß = 0.01, 95% CI: 0.36 to 5.45). Negative coping and fatigue were positively correlated with all three PTSS (all P < 0.001), including re-experiencing, avoidance and hyper-arousal.

A considerable proportion of HCWs was traumatized during the COVID-19 outbreak. Hence, the institutions should screen out and pay close attention to HCWs who tend to use negative coping (e.g., withdrawal thinking, distraction and blaming others) and arrange work scientifically to avoid overfatigue and PTSS amid the public health crisis.","Hou, Tianya; Yin, Qianlan; Cai, Wenpeng; Song, Xiangrui; Deng, Wenxi; Zhang, Jianguo; Deng, Guanghui",Psychol Health Med,529,16

However, there is much practice variation which could be explained by good practices: practices developed by local health care professionals, which are not evidence-based. Because an overview of good practices is lacking, we performed a scoping review to identify and summarize the available good practices for dialysis education, treatment, and eHealth. METHODS: Embase, Pubmed, the Cochrane Library, CINAHL databases and Web of Science were searched for relevant articles using all synonyms for the words ‘kidney failure’, ‘dialysis’, and ‘good practice’. Relevant articles were structured according to the categories dialysis education, dialysis treatment or eHealth, and assessed for content and results. RESULTS: Nineteen articles (12 for dialysis education, 3 for dialysis treatment, 4 for eHealth) are identified. The good practices for education endorse the importance of providing complete and objective predialysis education, assisting peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients in adequately performing PD, educating hemodialysis (HD) patients on self-management, and talking with dialysis patients about their prognosis. The good practices for dialysis treatment focus mainly on dialysis access devices and general quality improvement of dialysis care. Finally, eHealth is useful for HD and PD and affects both quality of care and health-related quality of life. CONCLUSION: Our scoping review identifies 19 articles describing good practices and their results for dialysis education, dialysis treatment, and eHealth.

The functions of macrophages, critical to both innate and acquired immunity, were compared between the more infectious bronchitis virus-resistant B2 and the more infectious bronchitis virus-susceptible B19 lines. In vivo peripheral blood concentrations of monocytes were similar in B2 or B19 homozygous haplotypes. Peripheral blood-derived macrophages were stimulated with poly I:C, simulating an RNA virus, or IFNγ, a cytokine at the interface of innate and adaptive immunity. Not only did B2-derived peripheral monocytes differentiate into macrophages more readily than the B19 monocytes, but as determined by NO production, macrophages from B2 and B2 on B19 genetic background chicks were also significantly more responsive to either stimulant. In conclusion, the correlation with resistance to illness following viral infection may be directly linked to a more vigorous innate immune response.","Dawes, Maisie E.; Griggs, Lisa M.; Collisson, Ellen W.; Briles, Worthie E.; Drechsler, Yvonne",Poult Sci,529,1

Depending on the extent of the outbreak, there may be insufficient capacity to provide ventilator support to all of those in need. As part of a larger conceptual framework for determining need for and allocation of ventilators during a public health emergency, this article focuses on the strategies to assist state and local planners to allocate stockpiled ventilators to healthcare facilities during a pandemic, accounting for critical factors in facilities' ability to make use of additional ventilators. These strategies include actions both in the pre-pandemic and intra-pandemic stages. As a part of pandemic preparedness, public health officials should identify and query healthcare facilities in their jurisdiction that currently care for critically ill patients on mechanical ventilation to determine existing inventory of these devices and facilities' ability to absorb additional ventilators. Facilities must have sufficient staff, space, equipment, and supplies to utilize allocated ventilators adequately. At the time of an event, jurisdictions will need to verify and update information on facilities' capacity prior to making allocation decisions. Allocation of scarce life-saving resources during a pandemic should consider ethical principles to inform state and local plans for allocation of ventilators. In addition to ethical principles, decisions should be informed by assessment of need, determination of facilities' ability to use additional ventilators, and facilities' capacity to ensure access to ventilators for vulnerable populations (eg, rural, inner city, and uninsured and underinsured individuals) or high-risk populations that may be more susceptible to illness.","Koonin, Lisa M.; Pillai, Satish; Kahn, Emily B.; Moulia, Danielle; Patel, Anita",Health Secur,529,16

Frequently managed in out-patient settings, the clinical course is unpredictable and requires multi-disciplinary care. There remains substantial variation in management. In contrast to acute pancreatitis, there are no globally accepted classification or severity scores to predict the disease course or compare interventions. We conducted a systematic review to determine the scope and clinical use of existing scoring systems. METHODS A systematic search was developed with a medical librarian using the Embase, Medline and Cochrane databases. Original articles and conference abstracts describing an original or modified classification or scoring system in CP that stratified patients into clinical and/or severity categories were included. To assess clinical application/validation, studies using all or part of a score as a stratification tool to measure another parameter or outcome were selected. Studies reporting on diagnosis or aetiology only were excluded. Four authors performed the search in independent pairs and conflicts were resolved by a fifth author using CovidenceTM systematic review software. RESULTS Following screening 6,652 titles and 235 full-text reviews, 48 papers were analysed. Eleven described original scores and 6 described modifications of published scores. Many were comprehensive but limited in capturing the full spectrum of disease. In 31 studies, a score was used to categorise patients to compare or correlate various outcome measures. Exocrine and endocrine dysfunction and pain were included in 6, 5, and 4 scoring systems, respectively. No score included other nutrition parameters, such as bone health, malnutrition, or nutrient deficiency. Only one score has been objectively validated prospectively and independently for monitoring clinical progression and prognosis, but this had been applied to an in-patient population. CONCLUSION Available systems and scores do not reflect recent advances and guidelines in CP and are not commonly used. A practical clinical classification and scoring system, validated prospectively for prognostication would be useful for the meaningful analysis in observational and interventional studies in CP.","Rahman, Abidur; O'Connor, Donal B; Gather, Felix; Koscic, Sarah; Gilgan, Joshua; Mockler, David; Bashir, Yasir; Memba, Robert; Duggan, Sinead N; Conlon, Kevin C",Digestive surgery,529,16

In this study, we first verified that SARS-CoV-2 uses human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a cell receptor and that its spike (S) protein mediates high membrane fusion activity. The heptad repeat 1 (HR1) sequence in the S2 fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2 possesses markedly increased α-helicity and thermostability, as well as a higher binding affinity with its corresponding heptad repeat 2 (HR2) site, than the HR1 sequence in S2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Then, we designed an HR2 sequence-based lipopeptide fusion inhibitor, termed IPB02, which showed highly potent activities in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 S protein-mediated cell-cell fusion and pseudovirus transduction. IPB02 also inhibited the SARS-CoV pseudovirus efficiently. Moreover, the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of IPB02 was characterized with a panel of truncated lipopeptides, revealing the amino acid motifs critical for its binding and antiviral capacities. Therefore, the results presented here provide important information for understanding the entry pathway of SARS-CoV-2 and the design of antivirals that target the membrane fusion step. IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, presents a serious global public health emergency in urgent need of prophylactic and therapeutic interventions. The S protein of coronaviruses mediates viral receptor binding and membrane fusion, thus being considered a critical target for antivirals. Herein, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 S protein has evolved a high level of activity to mediate cell-cell fusion, significantly differing from the S protein of SARS-CoV that emerged previously. The HR1 sequence in the fusion protein of SARS-CoV-2 adopts a much higher helical stability than the HR1 sequence in the fusion protein of SARS-CoV and can interact with the HR2 site to form a six-helical bundle structure more efficiently, underlying the mechanism of the enhanced fusion capacity. Also, importantly, the design of membrane fusion inhibitors with high potencies against both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV has provided potential arsenals to combat the pandemic and tools to exploit the fusion mechanism.","Zhu, Yuanmei; Yu, Danwei; Yan, Hongxia; Chong, Huihui; He, Yuxian",J Virol,529,29

The intervention is a software program that extracts relevant biochemical data from laboratory databases which then generate graphs of estimated kidney function (eGFR) over time. Graphs showing progressive kidney disease are sent directly back to general practitioners (GPs) to alert them to rereview patient care and if necessary, refer to renal services. The aim of this evaluation study was to explain the barriers and drivers to implementation and adoption of the eGFR graph intervention. This evaluation study involved 5 of the 20 participating renal units (sites). A developmental evaluation approach was used. Methods included collection of descriptive data about graph reporting; GP surveys (n=68); focus groups (n=4) with practices; face-to-face interviews with secondary care clinicians (n=10). Results showed the mean number of graphs reviewed per week per site was 230, taking 1 hour per week per site. Only 18.2% graphs highlighted a concerning decline in kidney function. Important enablers to sustain the intervention were low cost, easy to understand, a sense of local ownership and perceived impact. Barriers included nephrologists’ perceived increase in new referrals. We concluded that developmental evaluation can explain the barriers/drivers to implementation of a national quality improvement project that involves a variety of different stakeholders. The intervention has the potential to slow down progression of kidney disease due to the eGFR prompts alerting GPs to review the patient record and take action, such as reviewing medications and referring to renal teams if progressive kidney disease had not been identified previously.","Thomas, Nicola; Nation, Michael; Woolnough, Lesley; Gallagher, Hugh",BMJ Open Qual,529,20

Numerical simulations of SARDDE describe well the outcomes of current symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, recovered symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals, and died individuals, respectively. The numerical simulations suggest that both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals cause lesser asymptomatic spread than symptomatic spread; blocking rate of about 90% cannot prevent the spread of the COVID19 epidemic in Beijing; the strict prevention and control strategies implemented by Beijing government is not only very effective but also completely necessary.

We developed an integrated analytical framework by combining a developmental framework, including absolutist, multiplist, and evaluatist, with a multi-dimensional framework, including limits of knowing, certainty of knowing, and criteria of knowing. Furthermore, we examined the potential influence of the question contexts and the students’ grade levels. A total of 188 secondary school students were surveyed. Students answered two sets of model evaluation questions based on two scientific contexts. After reading the information about the two models, the students had to choose from three epistemic assumptions and then provide written justifications explaining their choice of assumptions. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted for the multiple-choice questions and the written responses. In both contexts there were higher percentages of 11th-grade students choosing the evaluatist assumptions than the eighth-grade students. For students choosing multiplist and evaluatist assumptions, the 11th-grade students were more likely than the eighth-grade students to think in terms of pragmatic and evidential criteria as the criteria of knowing. Different contexts of the questions evoked different views of model evaluation particularly regarding the limits of knowing. Four additional categories of epistemic levels also emerged from the data. This study provides a new framework for understanding students’ thinking about model evaluation.

Furthermore, TS also decreased white blood cells (WBC), indicating inhibition of differentiation of the precursor of macrophages in WEHI-3 bearing mice. Treatment of WEHI-3 cells with TS (0-75 μg/mL for 24 hours) significantly reduced cell viability. Furthermore, TS treatment–induced late apoptosis was confirmed by Annexin-V/PI staining. Western blot analyses revealed that treatment of WEHI-3 cells with TS statistically increased the protein expression level of cytochrome c in the cytoplasm and activates caspase-3.

In the first month following March adoptions of social distancing measures by states, unemployment rose to 14.5 percent but a much higher 24.4 percent when we correct for potential data misclassification noted by the BLS. Using the official definition, unemployment in April 2020 among African-Americans rose by less than what would have been anticipated (to 16.6 percent) based on previous recessions, and the long-term ordering of unemployment across racial/ethnic groups was altered with Latinx unemployment (18.2 percent) rising for the first time to the highest among major groups. Difference-in-difference estimates confirm that the initial gap in unemployment between whites and blacks in April was not different than in periods prior to the pandemic; however, the racial gap expanded as unemployment for whites declined in the next two months but was largely stagnant for blacks. The initially large gap in unemployment between whites and Latinx in April was sustained in May and June as unemployment declined similarly for both groups. Non-linear decompositions show a favorable industry distribution partly protected black employment during the early stages of the pandemic, but that an unfavorable occupational distribution and lower average skills levels placed them at higher risk of job losses. An unfavorable occupational distribution and lower skills contributed to a sharply widened Latinx-white unemployment gap that moderated over time as rehiring occurred. These findings of disproportionate impacts on minority unemployment raise important concerns regarding lost earnings and wealth, and longer-term consequences of the pandemic on racial inequality in the United States.","Couch, Kenneth A.; Fairlie, Robert W.; Xu, Huanan",J Public Econ,529,26

Data-driven agriculture has emerged as a way to palliate the lack of meaningful information when taking critical steps in the field. However, many decisive parameters still require manual measurements and proximity to the target, which results in the typical undersampling that impedes statistical significance and the application of AI techniques that rely on massive data. To invert this trend, and simultaneously combine crop proximity with massive sampling, a sensing architecture for automating crop scouting from ground vehicles is proposed. At present, there are no clear guidelines of how monitoring vehicles must be configured for optimally tracking crop parameters at high resolution. This paper structures the architecture for such vehicles in four subsystems, examines the most common components for each subsystem, and delves into their interactions for an efficient delivery of high-density field data from initial acquisition to final recommendation. Its main advantages rest on the real time generation of crop maps that blend the global positioning of canopy location, some of their agronomical traits, and the precise monitoring of the ambient conditions surrounding such canopies. As a use case, the envisioned architecture was embodied in an autonomous robot to automatically sort two harvesting zones of a commercial vineyard to produce two wines of dissimilar characteristics. The information contained in the maps delivered by the robot may help growers systematically apply differential harvesting, evidencing the suitability of the proposed architecture for massive monitoring and subsequent data-driven actuation. While many crop parameters still cannot be measured non-invasively, the availability of novel sensors is continually growing; to benefit from them, an efficient and trustable sensing architecture becomes indispensable.","Rovira-Más, Francisco; Saiz-Rubio, Verónica; Cuenca-Cuenca, Andrés",Sensors (Basel),529,28

Heart disease leads to heart failure (HF) in affected patients. Therefore any additional aid to current medical support systems is crucial for the clinician to forecast the survival status for these patients. The collaborative use of machine learning and IoT devices has become very important in today’s intelligent healthcare systems. This paper presents a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) secured IoT enabled framework entitled Cardiac Diagnostic Feature and Demographic Identification (CDF-DI) systems with significant Models that recognize several Cardiac disease features related to HF. To achieve this goal, we used statistical and machine learning techniques to analyze the Cardiac secondary dataset. The Elevated Serum Creatinine (SC) levels and Serum Sodium (SS) could cause renal problems and are well established in HF patients. The Mann Whitney U test found that SC and SS levels affected the survival status of patients (p < 0.05). Anemia, diabetes, and BP features had no significant impact on the SS and SC level in the patient (p > 0.05). The Cox regression model also found a significant association of age group with the survival status using follow-up months. Furthermore, the present study also proposed important features of Cardiac disease that identified the patient’s survival status, age group, and gender. The most prominent algorithm was the Random Forest (RF) suggesting five key features to determine the survival status of the patient with an accuracy of 96%: Follow-up months, SC, Ejection Fraction (EF), Creatinine Phosphokinase (CPK), and platelets. Additionally, the RF selected five prominent features (smoking habits, CPK, platelets, follow-up month, and SC) in recognition of gender with an accuracy of 94%. Moreover, the five vital features such as CPK, SC, follow-up month, platelets, and EF were found to be significant predictors for the patient’s age group with an accuracy of 96%.

There is currently a lack of effective drugs to treat people infected with SARS-CoV-2. The SARS-CoV-2 Non-structural protein 13 (NSP13) is a superfamily1B helicase that has been identified as a possible target for anti-viral drugs due to its high sequence conservation and essential role in viral replication. In this study we present crystal structures of SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 solved in the APO form and in the presence of both phosphate and the non-hydrolysable ATP analogue (AMP-PNP). Comparisons of these structures reveal details of global and local conformational changes that are induced by nucleotide binding and hydrolysis and provide insights into the helicase mechanism and possible modes of inhibition. Structural analysis reveals two pockets on NSP13 that are classified as “druggable” and include one of the most conserved sites in the entire SARS-CoV-2 proteome. To identify possible starting points for anti-viral drug development we have performed a crystallographic fragment screen against SARS-CoV-2 NSP13 helicase. The fragment screen reveals 65 fragment hits across 52 datasets, with hot spots in pockets predicted to be of functional importance, including the druggable nucleotide and nucleic acid binding sites, opening the way to structure guided development of novel antiviral agents.","Newman, Joseph A; Douangamath, Alice; Yazdani, Setayesh; Yosaatmadja, Yuliana; Aimon, Anthony; Brandão-Neto, José; Dunnett, Louise; Gorrie-stone, Tyler; Skyner, Rachel; Fearon, Daren; Schapira, Matthieu; von Delft, Frank; Gileadi, Opher",bioRxiv,529,5

METHODS: : Ecological longitudinal study using multivariable negative binomial regression for panel data. Daily numbers of Covid-19 cases and deaths, and data on social distancing interventions, for the 37 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) were analysed. RESULTS: : Covid-19 cumulative mortality over the first pandemic wave varied widely across countries (range, 4.16 to 855 deaths per million population). On average, one-day delay in application of mass gatherings ban was associated with an adjusted increase in Covid-19 cumulative mortality by 6.97% (95% CI, 3.45 to 10.5), whilst a one-day delay in school closures was associated with an increase of 4.37% (95% CI, 1.58 to 7.17) over the study period. We estimated that if each country had enacted both interventions one week earlier, Covid-19 cumulative mortality could have been reduced by an average of 44.1% (95% CI, 20.2 to 67.9). CONCLUSIONS: : Early application of mass gatherings ban and school closures in outbreak epicentres was associated with an important reduction in Covid-19 cumulative mortality during the first pandemic wave.

Among all approaches, messenger RNA (mRNA) -based vaccine has emerged as a rapid and versatile platform to quickly respond to such a challenge. Here, we developed a lipid-nanoparticle-encapsulated mRNA (mRNA-LNP) encoding the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 as a vaccine candidate (termed ARCoV). Intramuscular immunization of ARCoV mRNA-LNPs elicited robust neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 as well as Th1-biased cellular response in mice and non-human primates. Two doses of ARCoV immunization in mice conferred complete protection against the challenge of a SARS-CoV-2 mouse adapted strain. Additionally, ARCoV was manufactured in liquid formulation and can be stored at room temperature for at least one week. This novel COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, ARCoV, is currently being evaluated in phase 1 clinical trials.","Zhang, Na-Na; Li, Xiao-Feng; Deng, Yong-Qiang; Zhao, Hui; Huang, Yi-Jiao; Yang, Guan; Huang, Wei-Jin; Gao, Peng; Zhou, Chao; Zhang, Rong-Rong; Guo, Yan; Sun, Shi-Hui; Fan, Hang; Zu, Shu-Long; Chen, Qi; He, Qi; Cao, Tian-Shu; Huang, Xing-Yao; Qiu, Hong-Ying; Nie, Jian-Hui; Jiang, Yuhang; Yan, Hua-Yuan; Ye, Qing; Zhong, Xia; Xue, Xia-Lin; Zha, Zhen-Yu; Zhou, Dongsheng; Yang, Xiao; Wang, You-Chun; Ying, Bo; Qin, Cheng-Feng",Cell,529,32

There are few studies about the experiences of midwives providing care during the COVID pandemic and very few have been undertaken in the countries of southern Europe such as Spain. This article sets out to take a more in-depth look at the experiences of midwives who were on the frontline of care during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as to identify new needs and resilience strategies that can help midwives. Methods: A qualitative methodology of phenomenological tradition was used, interviewing 10 midwives from primary care, hospital and independent care. Results: After content analysis, three central categories emerged: (a) cascade of emotions; (b) professional occupation and concern for the women; (c) resisting the day-to-day; resilience and resistance strategies. Conclusions: Despite the difficulties, midwives are concerned about the loss of rights and autonomy and about the increased vulnerability of women. Midwives have become aware of the power they have in their actions both in health management and administration, as well as in the care of women, creating strategies to provide dignified care to their users.","Goberna-Tricas, Josefina; Biurrun-Garrido, Ainoa; Perelló-Iñiguez, Carme; Rodríguez-Garrido, Pía",Int J Environ Res Public Health,529,20

Despite the unprecedented nature of this challenge, there is no sound justification for systemic erosion of rights-protective democratic ideals and institutions beyond that which is strictly demanded by the exigencies of the pandemic. A Wuhan-inspired all-or-nothing approach to viral containment sets a dangerous precedent for future pandemics and disasters, with the global copycat response indicating an impending ‘pandemic’ of a different sort, that of authoritarianization.

This study aims to conduct an in-depth analysis by geographic strata: Wuhan City (hereafter referred to as Wuhan) only, Hubei Province (hereafter referred to as Hubei) excluding Wuhan, and China excluding Hubei. METHODS: Daily cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases between December 8, 2019 (the date of symptom onset based on patients’ recall), and March 1, 2020, from official sources and published studies were analyzed. The second derivative model was used for information extraction. Data analysis was conducted separately for the three strata. RESULTS: A total of 80 026 diagnosed COVID-19 cases were reported during the first 85 days of the epidemic, with 49 315 cases from Wuhan, 17 788 from Hubei excluding Wuhan, and 12 923 from China excluding Hubei. Analytical results indicate that the COVID-19 epidemic consists of an Acceleration, a Deceleration, and a Stabilization Phase in all three geographic strata, plus a Silent Attack Phase for Wuhan only. Given the reported incubation period of 14 days, effects of the massive anti-epidemic actions were revealed by both the Acceleration and Deceleration Phases. The Acceleration Phase signaled the effect of the intervention to detect the infected; the Deceleration Phase signaled the declines in new infections after the infected were detected, treated and quarantined. CONCLUSION: Findings of the study provide new evidence to better monitor the epidemic, evaluate its response to intervention, and predict the trend long. In addition to re-evaluating the control of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, this study provided a model for monitoring outbreaks of COVID-19 in different countries across the world.","Yu, Bin; Chen, Xinguang; Rich, Shannan; Mo, Qiqing; Yan, Hong",Glob Health J,529,7

Very little is known about the host pathways that regulate the stability of CoV mRNAs, which carry some unusual features. Nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is a eukaryotic RNA surveillance pathway that detects mRNAs harboring aberrant features and targets them for degradation. Although CoV mRNAs are of cytoplasmic origin, the presence of several NMD-inducing features (including multiple ORFs with internal termination codons that create a long 3′ untranslated region) in CoV mRNAs led us to explore the interplay between the NMD pathway and CoVs. Our study using murine hepatitis virus as a model CoV showed that CoV mRNAs are recognized by the NMD pathway as a substrate, resulting in their degradation. Furthermore, CoV replication induced the inhibition of the NMD pathway, and N protein (a viral structural protein) had an NMD inhibitory function that protected viral mRNAs from rapid decay. Our data further suggest that the NMD pathway interferes with optimal viral replication by degrading viral mRNAs early in infection, before sufficient accumulation of N protein. Our study presents clear evidence for the biological importance of the NMD pathway in controlling the stability of mRNAs and the efficiency of replication of a cytoplasmic RNA virus.","Wada, Masami; Lokugamage, Kumari G.; Nakagawa, Keisuke; Narayanan, Krishna; Makino, Shinji",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,529,3

The list of microbial pathogens associated with regulatory T cell responses is growing rapidly and includes bacteria, viruses, parasites, and fungi. As the biology of regulatory T cells is revealed, we are discovering that their induction during infection is a normal aspect of immunity, necessary to limit collateral damage from inflammatory responses and aggressive immunological effectors. Thus, these cells play a critical role in maintaining the delicate balance between preventing immunopathology and allowing the immune response to clear infections. While generally successful, there are notable exceptions where regulatory T cell-mediated suppression appears to be responsible for allowing certain viruses to establish and maintain a persistent state. In this review, we will discuss our current understanding of what virus-induced regulatory T cells are, how they are induced, and what mechanisms they use to suppress immunity.

Th2 cells are predominantly involved in mild asthma, whereas a mixture of Th1 and Th2 cells with neutrophilic inflammation, probably induced by Th17, affects more severe asthmatic disease. Exacerbation of asthmatic inflammation is often triggered by airway‐targeting RNA viral infection; virus‐derived double‐stranded RNA, Toll‐like receptor (TLR)3 ligand, activates bronchial epithelial cells to produce pro‐inflammatory mediators, including TSLP. Objective Because TSLPR‐expressing DCs express TLR3, we examined how the relationship between TSLP and TLR3 ligand stimulation influences DC activation. Methods CD11c(+)DCs purified from adult peripheral blood were cultured in TLR ligands containing media with or without TSLP and then co‐cultured with allogeneic naïve CD4(+)T cells. Results CD11c(+) DCs responded to a combination of TSLP and TLR3 ligand, poly(I : C), to up‐regulate expression of the functional TSLP receptor and TLR3. Although TSLP alone did not induce IL‐23 production by DCs, poly(I : C) alone primed DCs for the production of IL‐23, and a combination of TSLP and poly(I : C) primed DCs for further production of IL‐23. The addition of poly(I : C) did not inhibit TSLP‐activated DCs to prime naïve CD4(+) T cells to differentiate into inflammatory Th2 cells. Furthermore, DCs activated by a combination of TSLP and poly(I : C) primed more naïve CD4(+) T cells to differentiate into Th17‐cytokine–producing cells with a central memory T cell phenotype compared with DCs activated by poly(I : C) alone. Conclusions These results suggest that through DC activation, human TSLP and TLR3 ligands promote differentiation of Th17 cells with the central memory T cell phenotype under Th2‐polarizing conditions.","Tanaka, J.; Watanabe, N.; Kido, M.; Saga, K.; Akamatsu, T.; Nishio, A.; Chiba, T.",Clin Exp Allergy,529,1

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of anabolic implants varying in hormone type and concentration on growth, carcass characteristics, and trace mineral concentrations in Angus steers. Cattle administered an estradiol only implant did not experience differences in growth compared to non-implanted controls. However, cattle implanted with a trenbolone acetate only implant or a combined (estradiol and trenbolone acetate) implant experienced improvements in growth and changes in plasma and liver trace mineral concentrations. Greatest differences in growth and trace mineral concentrations were observed in steers administered the combination implant compared to non-implanted controls. These data suggest hormone type and concentration influence implant-induced growth and changes in plasma and liver trace mineral concentrations. ABSTRACT: Fifty Angus-sired steers were utilized to evaluate the effects of anabolic implants varying in hormone type and concentration on performance, carcass traits, and plasma and liver trace mineral concentrations over 129 d. Steers were stratified by weight into one of four (n = 12 or 13/treatment) implant treatments: (1) estradiol (E2; 25.7 mg E2; Compudose, Elanco Animal Health, Greenfield, IN, USA), (2) trenbolone acetate (TBA; 200 mg TBA; Finaplix-H, Merck Animal Health, Madison, NJ, USA), (3) combination implant (ETBA; 120 mg TBA + 24 mg E2; Revalor-S, Merck Animal Health), or (4) no implant (CON). Steers were randomly assigned to pens equipped with GrowSafe bunks and fed a corn and barley-based finishing ration. Overall average daily gain and body weight were greater for ETBA and TBA than CON (p ≤ 0.04), but not E2 (p ≥ 0.12). Feed efficiency and hot carcass weight were only greater than CON for ETBA (p ≤ 0.03).

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included all adult patients at our institution undergoing PB haplo‐HCT with PTCy between June 2009 and June 2015. Infections were microbiologically confirmed. Invasive fungal infections (IFI) classified as “proven” or “probable” by standard definitions were included. RESULTS: In total, 104 patients were identified. Median follow‐up was 218 days (range: 6–1576). A total of 322 episodes of infection were recorded. Eighty‐nine percent of patients experienced at least one infection. Median time to first infection was 22 days. Patients experiencing at least one bacterial, viral, and IFI were 62%, 72%, and 6%, respectively. The majority (69%) of bacterial infections were caused by enteric organisms. Seven cases of Staphylococcus aureus infection were recorded, with one bacteremia case. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia occurred in 54/71 (76%) at‐risk patients at a median time of 24 days. Sixteen (15%) patients developed CMV disease. Nineteen percent (20/104) of patients developed BK polyomavirus‐associated cystitis. Six (6%) patients experienced a total of seven IFI. Infection was the primary cause of death for 12% (6/51) of patients and was a secondary cause for 41%. CONCLUSION: In PB haplo‐HCT patients, a high incidence of CMV viremia and disease was observed. Infections with enteric bacteria were common. Fungal and staphylococcal infections were uncommon.

OBJECTIVE: We longitudinally tracked vital signs using data from wearable sensors and determined associations with anxiety and depression. METHODS: We selected all participants in the HUAWEI Heart Study from Wuhan and four nearby large provincial capital cities (Guangzhou, Chongqing, Hangzhou, Zhengzhou) and extracted all data from 26 December 2019 (one month before city lockdown) to 21 February 2020. Sleep duration and quality, daily steps, oxygen saturation and heart rate were collected on a daily basis. We compared the vital signs before and after the lockdown using segmented regression analysis of the interrupted time series. The depression and anxiety cases were defined as scores ≥8 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale depression and anxiety subscales [HADS-D and HADS-A] in 727 participants who finished the survey. RESULTS: We included 19,960 participants (mean age 36 yrs, 90% men). Compared with pre-lockdown, resting heart rate dropped immediately by 1.1 bpm after city lockdown (95% confidence interval [CI]: –1.8, –0.4). Sleep duration increased by 0.5 hour (95% CI: 0.3, 0.8) but deep sleep ratio decreased by 0.9% (95% CI: –1.2, –0.6). Daily steps decreased by 3352 steps (95% CI: –4333, –2370). Anxiety and depression existed in 26% and 17% among 727 available participants, respectively, and associated with longer sleep duration (0.2 and 0.1 hour, both p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Lockdown of Wuhan in China was associated with an adverse vital signs profile (reduced physical activity, heart rate, and sleep quality, but increased sleep duration).

Antibody development efforts mainly revolve around the extensively glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein, which mediates host cell entry by binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Similar to many other viral fusion proteins, the SARS-CoV-2 spike utilizes a glycan shield to thwart the host immune response. Here, we built a full-length model of the glycosylated SARS-CoV-2 S protein, both in the open and closed states, augmenting the available structural and biological data. Multiple microsecond-long, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were used to provide an atomistic perspective on the roles of glycans and on the protein structure and dynamics. We reveal an essential structural role of N-glycans at sites N165 and N234 in modulating the conformational dynamics of the spike’s receptor binding domain (RBD), which is responsible for ACE2 recognition. This finding is corroborated by biolayer interferometry experiments, which show that deletion of these glycans through N165A and N234A mutations significantly reduces binding to ACE2 as a result of the RBD conformational shift toward the “down” state. Additionally, end-to-end accessibility analyses outline a complete overview of the vulnerabilities of the glycan shield of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, which may be exploited in the therapeutic efforts targeting this molecular machine. Overall, this work presents hitherto unseen functional and structural insights into the SARS-CoV-2 S protein and its glycan coat, providing a strategy to control the conformational plasticity of the RBD that could be harnessed for vaccine development.","Casalino, Lorenzo; Gaieb, Zied; Goldsmith, Jory A.; Hjorth, Christy K.; Dommer, Abigail C.; Harbison, Aoife M.; Fogarty, Carl A.; Barros, Emilia P.; Taylor, Bryn C.; McLellan, Jason S.; Fadda, Elisa; Amaro, Rommie E.",ACS Cent Sci,529,16

Recent studies revealed that 3a could interact specifically with many SARS-CoV structural proteins, such as M, E and S protein. Expressed 3a protein was reported to localize to Golgi complex in SARS-CoV infected cells. In this study, it was shown that 3a protein was mainly located in Golgi apparatus with different tags at N- or C-terminus. The localization pattern was similar in different transfected cells. With the assay of truncated 3a protein, it was shown that 3a might contain three transmembrane regions, and the second or third region was properly responsible for Golgi localization. By ultra-centrifugation experiment with different extraction buffers, it was confirmed that 3a was an integral membrane protein and embedded in the phospholipid bilayer. Immunofluorescence assay indicated that 3a was co-localized with M protein in Golgi complex in co-transfected cells.

We conducted sero-prevalence study to estimate prior infection with with SARS-CoV-2 in Addis Ababa. Methods A cross-sectional study was done from April 23 to 28, 2020 among 301 randomly selected residents of Addis Ababa; with no known history of contact with confirmed COVID-19 person. Interviews on socio demographic and behavioural risk factor followed by serological tests were performed for SARS-CoV-2 IgM, and IgG antibodies, using COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette. The test has sensitivity of 87·9% and specificity of 100% for lgM; and a sensitivity of 97·2% and specificity of 100% for IgG. RT-PCR test was also done on combined nasopharyngeal and oropharengeal swabs as an important public health consideration. Findings The unadjusted antibody-based crude SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was 7·6% and the adjusted true SARS-CoV-2 prevalence was estimated at 8·8% (95% CI 5·5%-11·6%) for the study population. Higher sero-prevalence were observed for males (9.0%), age below 50 years (8.2%), students and unemployed (15.6%), those with primary education (12.1%), smokers (7.8%), alcohol consumers (8.6%), chatt-chewers (13.6%) and shish smokers (18.8%). Seroprevalence was not significantly associated neither with socio-demographic not behavioral characteristics. According to the findings, possibly more individuals had been infected in Addis Ababa than what was being detected and reported by RT-PCR test suggestive of community transmission.

In Ethiopia, more specifically in the capital city of Addis Ababa, a sudden increase in the number of confirmed positive cases in high-risk groups of the community has been observed over the last few weeks of the first case. Therefore, this study aims to assess knowledge, practice and associated factors that can contribute to the prevention of COVID-19 among high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. METHODS: A cross-sectional in person survey (n = 6007) was conducted from 14–30 April, 2020 following a prioritization within high-risk groups in Addis Ababa. The study area targeted bus stations, public transport drivers, air transport infrastructure, health facilities, public and private pharmacies, hotels, government-owned and private banks, telecom centers, trade centers, orphanages, elderly centers, prison, prisons and selected slum areas where the people live in a crowded areas. A questionnaire comprised of four sections (demographics, knowledge, practice and reported symptoms) was used for data collection. The outcomes (knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 and practice) were measured using four items. A multi variable logistic regression was applied with adjustment for potential confounding. RESULTS: About half (48%, 95% CI: 46–49) of the study participants had poor knowledge on the transmission mode of COVID-19 whereas six out of ten (60%, 95% CI: 58–61) had good knowledge on prevention methods for COVID-19. The practice of preventive measures towards COVID-19 was found to be low (49%, 95% CI: 48–50). Factors that influence knowledge on COVID-19 transmission mechanisms were female gender, older age, occupation (health care and grocery worker), lower income and the use of the 8335 free call centre. Older age, occupation (being a health worker), middle income, experience of respiratory illness and religion were significantly associated with being knowledgeable about the prevention methods for COVID-19. The study found that occupation, religion, income, knowledge on the transmission and prevention of COVID-19 were associated with the practice of precautionary measures towards COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The study highlighted that there was moderate knowledge about transmission modes and prevention mechanisms. Similarly, there was moderate practice of measures that contribute towards the prevention of COVID-19 among these priority and high-risk communities of Addis Ababa. There is an urgent need to fill the knowledge gap in terms of transmission mode and prevention methods of COVID-19 to improve prevention practices and control the spread of COVID-19. Use of female public figures and religious leaders could support the effort towards the increase in awareness.","Defar, Atkure; Molla, Gebeyaw; Abdella, Saro; Tessema, Masresha; Ahmed, Muhammed; Tadele, Ashenif; Getachew, Fikresilassie; Hailegiorgis, Bezawit; Tigabu, Eyasu; Ababor, Sabit; Bizuwork, Ketema; Deressa, Asefa; Tasaw, Geremew; Kebede, Adisu; Melese, Daniel; Gashu, Andargachew; Eshetu, Kirubel; Tayachew, Adamu; Wossen, Mesfin; Hassen, Abduilhafiz; Habebe, Shambel; Assefa, Zewdu; Abayneh, Aschalew; Abate, Ebba; Tollera, Getachew",PLoS One,529,20

For this purpose, a hyaluronic acid-dexamethasone formulation was developed, affording an inhalable reconstituted nanosuspension suitable to be aerosolized. The physico-chemical and biopharmaceutical properties of the formulation were tested: size, stability, loading of the spray-dried dry powder, reconstitution capability upon redispersion in aqueous media. Detailed structural insights on nanoparticles after reconstitution were obtained by light and X-ray scattering techniques. (1) The size of the nanoparticles, around 200 nm, is in the proper range for a possible engulfment by macrophages. (2) Their structure is of the core-shell type, hosting dexamethasone nanocrystals inside and carrying hyaluronic acid chains on the surface. This specific structure allows for nanosuspension stability and provides nanoparticles with muco-inert properties. (3) The nanosuspension can be efficiently aerosolized, allowing for a high drug fraction potentially reaching the deep lung.

We impose an initial shock that disrupts the production capacity of one or more industries, and we calculate the propagation of production shortages with a modified Cobb–Douglas production function. For the Covid-19 case, we model the initial shock based on the loss of labor between March and April 2020 as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The industries within the network are assigned a resilience that determines the ability of an industry to absorb input losses, such that if the rate of input loss exceeds the resilience, the industry fails, and its outputs go to zero. We observed a critical resilience, such that, below this critical value, the network experienced a catastrophic cascade resulting in total network collapse.

As a result of this, hospital footfall required to be reduced due to increased risk of transmission of infection. To ensure patients can safely access healthcare, we introduced orthopaedic clinic telephone consultations in our busy district general hospital. AIM: To investigate patients’ and clinicians’ perspective of telephone consultations during COVID-19, and whether this method of consultation could be a viable option in the post- pandemic future. METHODS: This is a single centre, prospective study conducted in a busy National Health Service district general hospital. In May 2020, 100 non- consecutive adult patients were contacted by independent investigators within 48 h of their orthopaedic clinic telephone consultation to complete a telephone satisfaction questionnaire. The questions assessed satisfaction regarding various aspects of the consultation including overall satisfaction and willingness to use this approach long term. Satisfaction and perspective of 25 clinicians conducting these telephone consultations was also assessed via an online survey tool. RESULTS: 93% of patients were overall satisfied with telephone consultations and 79% were willing to continue this method of consultation post- pandemic. Patients found telephone consultations to reduce personal cost and inconvenience associated with attending a hospital appointment. 72% of clinicians reported overall satisfaction with this service and 80% agreed that telephone consultations should be used in the future. The majority found it less laborious in time and administration in comparison to face to face consultations. Patients and clinicians expressed their desire for video consultations as a method of further improving their experience with remote consultations. CONCLUSION: Our study has shown that telephone consultations are a safe and rapid method of adaptation to the COVID-19 pandemic, achieving the aim of reducing hospital footfall. This method of consultation has resulted in immense clinician and patient satisfaction. Our findings suggest that this tool has benefits in post pandemic healthcare delivery. It has also highlighted that telephone consultations can act as a steppingstone to the introduction of the more complex platform of video consulting.","Vusirikala, Anuhya; Ensor, David; Asokan, Ajay K; Lee, Alvin JX; Ray, Ravi; Tsekes, Dimitrios; Edwin, John",World J Orthop,529,16

The excessive and prolonged immune response is the hallmark of this disorder, so modulating and regulating inflammation plays an important role in its prevention and treatment. Resolvin D1 (RvD1) as a specialized pro-resolving mediator has the potential to suppress the expression of inflammatory cytokines and to facilitate the production of antioxidant proteins by stimulating lipoxin A4 receptor/formyl peptide receptor 2 (ALX/FPR2). These changes limit the invasion of immune cells into the lung tissue, inhibit coagulation, and enhance cell protection against oxidative stress (OS). In particular, this biomolecule reduces the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by blocking the activation of inflammatory transcription factors, especially nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and accelerating the synthesis of antioxidant compounds such as heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Therefore, the destruction and dysfunction of important cell components such as cytoplasmic membrane, mitochondria, Na+/k + adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) and proteins involved in the phagocytic activity of scavenger macrophages are attenuated. Numerous studies on the effect of RvD1 over inflammation using animal models revealed that Rvs have both anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving capabilities and therefore, might have potential therapeutic value in treating ALI. Here, we review the current knowledge on the classification, biosynthesis, receptors, mechanisms of action, and role of Rvs in ALI/ARDS.","Molaei, Emad; Molaei, Ali; Hayes, A.

Here, we have assessed protein-protein interfaces in macromolecular assemblies derived by cryo-EM. To this end, we developed PI-score, a density-independent machine learning-based metric, trained using protein-protein interfaces’ features in high-resolution crystal structures. Using PI-score, we were able to identify errors at interfaces in the PDB-deposited cryo-EM structures (including SARS-CoV-2 complexes) and in the models submitted for cryo-EM targets in CASP13 and the EM model challenge. Some of the identified errors, especially at medium-to-low resolution structures, were not captured by density-based assessment scores.

Although COVID-19 does disproportionately impact vulnerable populations, human behavior as measured by community mobility is equally influential in understanding disease spread. In this research, we seek to understand which of four composite measures perform best in explaining disease spread and mortality, and we explore the extent to which mobility account for variance in the outcomes of interest. We compare two community mobility measures, three composite measures of community vulnerability, and one composite measure that combines vulnerability and human behavior to assess their relative feasibility in modeling the US COVID-19 pandemic. Extensions – via temporally dependent fixed effect coefficients – of the commonly used Bayesian spatio-temporal Poisson disease mapping models are implemented and compared in terms of goodness of fit as well as estimate precision and viability. A comparison of goodness of fit measures nearly unanimously suggests the human behavior-based models are superior. The duration at residence mobility measure indicates two unique and seemingly inverse relationships between mobility and the COVID-19 pandemic: the findings indicate decreased COVID-19 presence with decreased mobility early in the pandemic and increased COVID-19 presence with decreased mobility later in the pandemic. The early indication is likely influenced by a large presence of state-issued stay at home orders and self-quarantine, while the later indication likely emerges as a consequence of holiday gatherings in a country under limited restrictions. This study implements innovative statistical methods and furnishes results that challenge the generally accepted notion that vulnerability and deprivation are key to understanding disparities in health outcomes. We show that human behavior is equally, if not more important to understanding disease spread. We encourage researchers to build upon the work we start here and continue to explore how other behaviors influence the spread of COVID-19.","Carroll, Rachel; Prentice, Christopher R.",Soc Sci Med,529,17

The purpose of this study is to assess the seroprevalence rate in a population of healthy blood donors living under strict lockdown measures in Jordan which has in total 144 confirmed cases per million population. Methods: Left-over sera and plasma samples from 746 healthy blood donors were tested using a commercially available FDA approved kit having a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 99.8% respectively. External positive controls were used for validation. Results: More than 80% of the donors were men 18-63 year old and residing in the capital city of Jordan, Amman. All tested specimens were negative yielding a zero seroprevalence rate in this healthy blood donor population. Conclusion: Strict lockdown measures effectively limit intracommunity spread of the infection, however at the cost of lack of any acquired community immunity. Additionally the use of highly specific test is recommended in low prevalence setting.","Sughayer, Maher A; Mansour, Asem; Nuirat, Abeer Al; Souan, Lina; Ghanem, Mohammad; Siag, Mahmoud",,529,24

In Australia, the outdoor recreation industry, already severely affected by the summer 2019-2020 bushfires, was further affected by COVID-19 restrictions including internal border closures, stay at home orders, social distancing requirements and travel restrictions. We surveyed outdoor recreation industry representatives in Australia to assess the impact of COVID-19 on professionals in the industry, views on career choices, and perspectives on the future of the industry in a post-COVID world. We found that COVID-19 affected outdoor recreation businesses in multiple ways, with a pessimistic outlook for the industry until travel restrictions and social distancing requirements are eased and economic confidence returns. This is unlikely to happen until vaccinations are rolled out nationally and herd immunity has been achieved. Even after this, however, the industry is likely to continue to suffer through loss of qualified staff and the flow-on effects of the imposed pause in guided outdoor recreation and tourism activities.

A common sentiment at the time was that Ebola served as a “wake-up call”—an alarm which signalled that an outbreak of that magnitude should never have occurred and that we are ill-prepared globally to prevent and respond to them when they do. Pledges were made that we must learn from the outbreak before we were faced with another. Nearly five years later the world is in the grips of a pandemic of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is therefore of no surprise that we are now yet again hearing that the COVID-19 pandemic serves as the “wake-up call” we need and that there are many lessons to be learned to better prepare us for future outbreaks. Will anything be different this time around? We argue that nothing will fundamentally change unless we truly understand and appreciate the nature of the lessons we should learn from these outbreaks.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We conducted retrospective review of all patients who were admitted with COVID-19 and developed bleeding events between March and June 2020. Data were analyzed in accordance with three major outcomes. Mortality within 30 days of bleeding episode, resolution of the bleeding event, and the type of bleeding event. RESULTS: Of 122 bleeds, there was 55 (28 %) gastrointestinal (GI) bleeds. Overall mortality was 59 % (n = 72). The prevalence of therapeutic invasive interventions was 11.5 % (n = 14) all were successful in resolving the bleeding event. We found that having a GI bleeds was associated with higher risk of mortality compared to non-GI bleeds (p = 0.04) and having occult bleeds to be associated with 15 times increased risk of mortality (OR 15, 95%CI 1.97–29.1, p = 0.01). Furthermore, patients who were on no anticoagulation (none) (OR 0.1, 95%CI 0.01–0.86, p < 0.00), on prophylactic dose anticoagulation (OR 0.07, 95%CI 0.02–0.28, p = 0.03) or intermediate dose anticoagulation (OR 0.36, 95%CI 0.09–1.34, p = 0.13) were less likely to die than patients on therapeutic dose. CONCLUSIONS: The best approach to manage COVID-19 bleeding patients is to prioritize therapies that manage sepsis induce coagulopathy and shock over other approaches. In COVID-19 patients’ routine prescription of supra-prophylactic dose anticoagulation should be revisited and more individualized approach to prescription should be the norm. Regardless of the cause of bleeding event it appears that the majority of bleeding events resolve with noninvasive interventions and when invasive interventions were necessary, they were associated with high success rate despite the delay.","Alkhamis, Ahmed; Alshamali, Yousef; Alyaqout, Khaled; lari, Eisa; Alkhamis, Moh A.; Althuwaini, Saad; Lari, Ali; Alfili, Maryam; Alkhayat, Ali; Jamal, Mohammad H.; Alsabah, Salman",Ann Med Surg (Lond),529,22

Given the limitations of current diagnostic methods, the development of fast and accurate tests for the diagnosis of viral and bacterial infections would improve patient management and treatment, as well as contribute to reducing antibiotic misuse in clinical settings. In this scenario, analysis of host transcriptomics constitutes a promising target to develop new diagnostic tests based on the host-specific response to infections. We carried out a multi-cohort meta-analysis of blood transcriptomic data available in public databases, including 11 different studies and 1209 samples from virus- (n = 695) and bacteria- (n = 514) infected patients. We applied a Parallel Regularized Regression Model Search (PReMS) on a set of previously reported genes that distinguished viral from bacterial infection to find a minimum gene expression bio-signature. This strategy allowed us to detect three genes, namely BAFT, ISG15 and DNMT1, that clearly differentiate groups of infection with high accuracy (training set: area under the curve (AUC) 0.86 (sensitivity: 0.81; specificity: 0.87); testing set: AUC 0.87 (sensitivity: 0.82; specificity: 0.86)). BAFT and ISG15 are involved in processes related to immune response, while DNMT1 is related to the preservation of methylation patterns, and its expression is modulated by pathogen infections. We successfully tested this three-transcript signature in the 11 independent studies, demonstrating its high performance under different scenarios. The main advantage of this three-gene signature is the low number of genes needed to differentiate both groups of patient categories.","Gómez-Carballa, Alberto; Barral-Arca, Ruth; Cebey-López, Miriam; Bello, Xabier; Pardo-Seco, Jacobo; Martinón-Torres, Federico; Salas, Antonio",Int J Mol Sci,529,24

Studies show that the spike (S) proteins of SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-S-1-S) and SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2-S) bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2, a well-recognized, functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) to mediate viral entry. Several hACE2 transgenic (hACE2Tg) mouse models are being widely used, which is clearly invaluable. However, the hACE2Tg mouse model cannot fully explain: 1) low expression of ACE2 observed in human lung and heart, but lung or heart failure occurs frequently in severe COVID-19 patients); 2) low expression of ACE2 on immune cells, but lymphocytopenia occurs frequently in COVID-19 patients; and 3) hACE2Tg mice do not develop strong clinical disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection in contrast to SARS-CoV-1. Moreover, one of most outstanding features of coronaviruses is the diversity of receptor usage, which includes the newly proposed human CD147 (hCD147) as a receptor for SARS-CoV-2-S. It is still debatable whether CD147 can serve as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection or entry. Here we successfully generated a hCD147Tg mouse model in the NOD-scid IL2Rgamma(null) (NSG) background. In this hCD147Tg-NSG mouse model, the hCD147 genetic sequence was placed following the endogenous mouse promoter for mouse CD147 (mCD147), which creates an in vivo model that may better recapitulate physiological expression of CD147 proteins at the molecular level compared to the existing and well-studied K18-hACE2-B6 model. In addition, the hCD147Tg-NSG mouse model allows further study of SARS-CoV-2 in the immunodeficiency condition which may assist our understanding of this virus in the context of high-risk populations with immunosuppressed conditions. The hCD147Tg-NSG mouse mode can serve as an additional animal model for interrogate whether CD147 serve as an independent functional receptor or accessory receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and immune responses.","Badeti, Saiaditya; Tseng, Hsiang-chi; Romanienko, Peter; Yehia, Ghassan; Liu, Dongfang",Res Sq,529,22

METHODS: Sixty-three confirmed patients were enrolled from December 30, 2019 to January 31, 2020. High-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest was performed. The number of affected lobes, ground glass nodules (GGO), patchy/punctate ground glass opacities, patchy consolidation, fibrous stripes and irregular solid nodules in each patient's chest CT image were recorded. Additionally, we performed imaging follow-up of these patients. RESULTS: CT images of 63 confirmed patients were collected. M/F ratio: 33/30. The mean age was 44.9 ± 15.2 years. The mean number of affected lobes was 3.3 ± 1.8. Nineteen (30.2%) patients had one affected lobe, five (7.9%) patients had two affected lobes, four (6.3%) patients had three affected lobes, seven (11.1%) patients had four affected lobes while 28 (44.4%) patients had 5 affected lobes.

Objective: The objective was to evaluate healthcare outcomes (continuity of care and healthcare utilization) for clients enrolled in LIFEspan. Methods: A prospective, longitudinal, observational mixed-method study design was used. The intervention group comprised youth with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) and Cerebral Palsy (CP) enrolled in LIFEspan. A prospective comparison group comprised youth with Spina Bifida (SB) who received standard care. A retrospective comparison group comprised historical, disability-matched clients (with ABI and CP) discharged prior to model introduction. Medical charts were audited to determine continuity of care, i.e., whether study participants had at least one visit to an adult provider within 1 year post-discharge from the pediatric hospital. Secondary outcomes related to healthcare utilization were obtained from population-based, health service administrative datasets. Data were collected over a 3-year period: 2 years pre and 1 year post pediatric discharge. Rates were estimated per person-year. Fisher's Exact Test was used to examine differences between groups on the primary outcome, while repeated measures GEE Poisson regression was used to estimate rate ratios (post vs. pre) with 95% confidence intervals for the secondary outcomes. Results: Prospective enrolment comprised 30 ABI, 48 CP, and 21 SB participants. Retrospective enrolment comprised 15 ABI and 18 CP participants. LIFEspan participants demonstrated significantly greater continuity of care (45% had engagement with adult services in the year following discharge at 18 years), compared to the prospective SB group (14%). Healthcare utilization data were inconsistent with no significant changes in frequency of physician office visits, emergency department visits, or hospitalizations for clients enrolled in LIFEspan in the year following discharge, compared to the 2 years prior to discharge. Conclusion: Introduction of the LIFEspan model increased continuity of care, with successful transfer from pediatric to adult services for clients enrolled. Data on longer-term follow-up are recommended for greater understanding of the degree of adult engagement and influence of LIFEspan on healthcare utilization following transfer.","Kingsnorth, Shauna; Lindsay, Sally; Maxwell, Joanne; Hamdani, Yani; Colantonio, Angela; Zhu, Jingqin; Bayley, Mark Theodore; Macarthur, Colin",Front Pediatr,529,1

The mainstay of treatment includes high dose corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulins and immunosuppressive drugs although, more recently, a more targeted approach, based on the use of selective cytokines inhibitors, has been reported. We present the case of a two-year-old boy with 1-month history of high degree fever associated with limping gait, cervical lymphadenopathy and skin rash. Laboratory tests showed elevation of inflammatory markers and ferritin. By exclusion criteria, systemic onset Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (sJIA) was diagnosed and steroid therapy started. A couple of weeks later, fever relapsed and laboratory tests were consistent with MAS. He was promptly treated with high doses intravenous methylprednisolone pulses and oral cyclosporin A. One day later, he developed an acute myocarditis and a systemic capillary leak syndrome needing intensive care. Intravenous Immunoglobulin and subcutaneous IL-1-antagonists Anakinra were added. On day 4, after an episode of cardiac arrest, venous-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO) was started. Considering the severe refractory clinical picture, we tried high dose intravenous Anakinra (HDIV-ANA, 2 mg/Kg q6h). This treatment brought immediate benefit: serial echocardiography showed progressive resolution of myocarditis, VA-ECMO was gradually decreased and definitively weaned off in 6 days and MAS laboratory markers improved. Our case underscores the importance of an early aggressive treatment in refractory life-threatening sJIA-related MAS and adds evidence on safety and efficacy of HDIV-ANA particularly in acute myocarditis needing VA-ECMO support.","Meneghel, Alessandra; Martini, Giorgia; Amigoni, Angela; Pettenazzo, Andrea; Padalino, Massimo; Zulian, Francesco",Front Pediatr,529,20

The resultant disease, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has rapidly developed into a worldwide pandemic, leading to severe health and economic burdens. Although the recently announced vaccines against COVID-19 has rekindled hope, there is still a major challenge to urgently meet the global need for rapid treatment of the pandemic. Given the urgency of the CoV outbreak, we propose a strategy to screen potential broad-spectrum drugs against CoV in a high-throughput manner, particularly against SARS-CoV-2. Since the essential functional domains of CoV are extensively homologous, the availability of two types of mild CoV, HCoV-OC43 and MHV, should provide a valuable tool for the rapid identification of promising drugs against CoV without the drawbacks of level three biological confinements. The luciferase reporter gene is introduced into HCoV-OC43 and MHV to indicate viral activity, and hence the antiviral efficiency of screened drugs can be quantified by luciferase activity. Compounds with antiviral activity against both HCoV-OC43 and MHV are further evaluated in SARS-CoV-2 after structural optimizations. This system allows large-scale compounds to be screened to search for broad-spectrum drugs against CoV in a high-throughput manner, providing potential alternatives for clinical management of SARS-CoV-2 or other CoV.","Liu, Jia; Li, Kang; Cheng, Lin; Shao, Jingjin; Yang, Shukun; Zhang, Wei; Zhou, Guangqian; de Vries, Antoine A.F.; Yu, Zhiyi",Int J Infect Dis,529,1

Since the widespread implementation of vaccination campaigns, reports of ocular adverse effects after COVID-19 vaccinations have emerged. This review summarizes ocular adverse effects possibly associated with COVID-19 vaccination, and discusses their clinical characteristics and management. METHODS: Narrative Literature Review. RESULTS: Ocular adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccinations include facial nerve palsy, abducens nerve palsy, acute macular neuroretinopathy, central serous retinopathy, thrombosis, uveitis, multiple evanescent white dot syndrome, Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease reactivation, and new-onset Graves’ Disease. Studies in current literature are primarily retrospective case series or isolated case reports – these are inherently weak in establishing association or causality. Nevertheless, the described presentations resemble the reported ocular manifestations of the COVID-19 disease itself. Hence, we hypothesize that the human body’s immune response to COVID-19 vaccinations may be involved in the pathogenesis of the ocular adverse effects post-COVID-19 vaccination. CONCLUSION: Ophthalmologists and generalists should be aware of the possible, albeit rare, ocular adverse effects after COVID-19 vaccination.","Ng, Xin Le; Betzler, Bjorn Kaijun; Testi, Ilaria; Ho, Su Ling; Tien, Melissa; Ngo, Wei Kiong; Zierhut, Manfred; Chee, Soon Phaik; Gupta, Vishali; Pavesio, Carlos E; de Smet, Marc D.; Agrawal, Rupesh",Ocul Immunol Inflamm,529,8

Vaccination is the most important way to control this disease. Nevertheless, novel variant strains are constantly reported because of the lack of proofreading capabilities of RNA polymerase and high frequency of homologous RNA recombination. Cross-protection studies has demonstrated that the vaccines could provide great protective effects against viruses of same serotype or genotype. However, the protective effect of different commercial vaccines and vaccine combinations against the prevalent IBV strains in China has rarely been studied. Due to the multiple genotype or serotype IBV strains prevalence in China, the polyvalent vaccines and their composition were used to expanding the protection spectrum of vaccine in practical application. In order to evaluate the protection of Chinese commercial IBV polyvalent vaccines against prevalent strains (QX-like and TW I-like), an immune-challenge test was conducted. Four polyvalent vaccines, containing 4/91, H120, YX10p90, LDT3-A and 28/86, were combined to form eight vaccination strategies, almost all of which could provide more than 70% protection effects against challenge with QX-like strain. Particularly, the best protection rate (93%) was generated by administration the polyvalent vaccine C (H120 + 28/86 + 4/91) at one-day-old and the polyvalent vaccine B (H120 + 4/91 + YX10p90) at 10-day-old. However, all the vaccination strategies in this study cannot provide great protective effects against TW-like strain, and more vaccines should be included in studies to expand the protection spectrum of vaccine. Therefore, for the newly emerging IBV strains, immunization with polyvalent vaccines via different vaccination strategies could be used to control the prevalence of IBV in a short time, while developing the homologous vaccines was not always necessary.","Shao, Guanming; Chen, Tong; Feng, Keyu; Zhao, Qiqi; Zhang, Xinheng; Li, Hongxin; Lin, Wencheng; Xie, Qingmei",Poult Sci,529,8

Unfortunately, for most of them, the drug products available on the market are not designed to be administered by a nasogastric tube to inpatients of intensive care units. Therefore, their manipulation, even if it can strongly affect the product quality, is necessary for the preparation of suspension to meet patients’ need.

Later, it was named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and declared a pandemic in March 2020. Saudi and global health agencies have provided various COVID-19 knowledge tools and facts to the general public. Therefore, this study aims to assess COVID-19 knowledge among the general public in Saudi Arabia at the early stages of the pandemic. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in March 2020 in Saudi Arabia. The study included 1006 participants who responded to a random online COVID-19 public knowledge questionnaire that included five sections: demographic characteristics, general knowledge, prevention practices, home quarantine measures, and knowledge of governmental restrictions. Three levels of knowledge were established: excellent, intermediate, and poor. Differences in the percentages of participants with different knowledge levels by the demographic variables were analyzed using the chi-square test. RESULTS: Regarding overall general knowledge of COVID-19, 75%, 24%, and 1% of the participants had excellent, intermediate, and poor knowledge levels, respectively. Knowledge levels were significantly different by nationality and age (P=0.027 and 0.008, respectively). Most participants (98.4%) reported excellent knowledge of prevention practices, with no statistically significant differences among groups (P>0.005). Older age groups reported higher knowledge of home quarantine measures (86.6% and 86.4% of the 51–60 and older than 60 age groups, respectively, P=0.001). CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: High levels of knowledge about the virus, including prevention practices, are essential. The provision of COVID-19 facts and knowledge tools should be focused on younger generations to enhance compliance with the governmental restrictions required to stop the spread of COVID-19.","Alqahtani, Ali; Aldahish, Afaf; Krishnaraju, V; Alqarni, Mona; Al-Sheikh Hassan, Mohammed",Patient Prefer Adherence,529,33

The aim of this study was to investigate the perceptions, experiences, and challenges healthcare professionals face when dealing with end-of-life decisions in ICUs in Croatia. A qualitative study was performed using professionally homogenous focus groups of ICU nurses and physicians (45 in total) of diverse professional and clinical backgrounds at three research sites (Zagreb, Rijeka, Split). In total, six institutions at the tertiary level of healthcare were included. The constant comparative analysis method was used in the analysis of the data. Differences were found between the perceptions and experiences of nurses and physicians in relation to end-of-life decisions. Nurses’ perceptions were more focused on the context and features of immediate care, while physicians’ perceptions also included the wider sociocultural context. However, the critical issues these specific professional groups face when dealing with end-of-life decisions seem to overlap. A high variability of practices, both between individual practitioners and between different organizational units, was omnipresent.
