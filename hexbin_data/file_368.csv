2703,2703,2703,"Platelet desialylation is a novel mechanism and a therapeutic target in thrombocytopenia during sepsis: an open-label, multicenter, randomized controlled trial",19.092396,9.603305,2017-05-11,"BACKGROUND: Studies in murine models suggested that platelet desialylation was an important mechanism of thrombocytopenia during sepsis. METHODS: First, we performed a prospective, multicenter, observational study that enrolled septic patients with or without thrombocytopenia to determine the association between platelet desialylation and thrombocytopenia in patients with sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock. Gender- and age-matched healthy adults were selected as normal controls in analysis of the platelet desialylation levels (study I). Next, we conducted an open-label randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which the patients who had severe sepsis with thrombocytopenia (platelet counts ≤50 × 10(9)/L) were randomly assigned to receive antimicrobial therapy alone (control group) or antimicrobial therapy plus oseltamivir (oseltamivir group) in a 1:1 ratio (study II). The primary outcomes were platelet desialylation level at study entry, overall platelet response rate within 14 days post-randomization, and all-cause mortality within 28 days post-randomization. Secondary outcomes included platelet recovery time, the occurrence of bleeding events, and the amount of platelets transfused within 14 days post-randomization. RESULTS: The platelet desialylation levels increased significantly in the 127 septic patients with thrombocytopenia compared to the 134 patients without thrombocytopenia. A platelet response was achieved in 45 of the 54 patients in the oseltamivir group (83.3%) compared with 34 of the 52 patients in the control group (65.4%; P = 0.045). The median platelet recovery time was 5 days (interquartile range 4–6) in the oseltamivir group compared with 7 days (interquartile range 5–10) in the control group (P = 0.003). The amount of platelets transfused decreased significantly in the oseltamivir group compared to the control group (P = 0.044). There was no difference in the overall 28-day mortality regardless of whether oseltamivir was used. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score and platelet recovery time were independent indicators of oseltamivir therapy. The main reason for all of the mortalities was multiple-organ failure. CONCLUSIONS: Thrombocytopenia was associated with increased platelet desialylation in septic patients. The addition of oseltamivir could significantly increase the platelet response rate, shorten platelet recovery time, and reduce platelet transfusion.

K., and Hemphill, M. L., Virology 164, 22–29, 1988). In this study, these DI RNAs were characterized by molecular cloning, hybridization with probes of defined sequence, and primer extension. The 7000-nt DI RNA species were found to be authentic DI RNAs which contain a single 2500- to 2700-nt deletion in the structural protein open reading frame (ORF) region of the genome. The 800-nt RNAs were found to be subgenomic DI RNAs synthesized from the large DI RNA templates. Analysis of the extent of the deletions using a reverse-transcription-PCR protocol revealed that the 3′ end of the deletions did not extend beyond the 3′ terminal 244 nts of the genome. The 5′ end of the deletions did not extend into the nonstructural protein ORF; however, DI RNAs in which the subgenomic start site was deleted were present. Following serial undiluted passage of seven independent stocks of RUB, this was the only pattern of DI RNAs generated. DI RNAs of 2000 to 3000 nt in length were the majority DI RNA species in a persistently infected line of Vero cells, showing that other types of RUB DI RNAs can be generated and selected. However, when supernatant from the persistently infected cells was passaged, the only DI RNAs present after two passages were 7000 nts in length, indicating that this species has a selective advantage over other types of DI RNAs during serial passage.","Derdeyn, Cynthia A.; Frey, Teryl K.",Virology,368,11

Two‐thirds were boys and 58 had parents or siblings with allergic symptoms. During winter‐spring, respiratory syncytial (RS) virus was verified in 50% of children. Other viral agents were adenovirus, parainfluenza 3, coxsackie B 2, ECHO 6 and rotavirus. At the acute stage, 54% of the children displayed changes on pulmonary X‐ray. The total IgE value was + 2 SD score units in 14 children. At reinvestigation after 3–4.5 years, when the children were aged 3.3–6.3 years, 53% were free from asthmatic symptoms; the median age for the last episode was 2 years. A total of 33% had mild asthma, 8% moderate and 6% severe asthma. The factors which correlated significantly with persistent asthma were: (1) The need for daily medication for at least 6 months. (2) A young age in conjunction with the first wheezing episode and on the first admission to a paediatric ward because of asthmatic symptoms. (3) Other past or present atopic symptoms. Heredity, tobacco smoking at home, having a furry pet, RS virus infection, or high total IgE at the time of the first admission did not correlate significantly with the persistence of asthma 3–4.5 years later. The results emphasize the good overall prognosis of wheezing in early childhood, even when the wheezing is severe enough to lead to inpatient treatment.","Wennergren, G; Hansson, S; Engström, I; Jodal, U; Åmark, M; Brolin, I; Juto, P",Acta Paediatr,368,27

The approaches to translational genomics can be broadly grouped into two methodologies, forward and reverse genomic translation. Traditional (forward) genomic translation begins with model systems and aims at using unbiased genetic associations in these models to derive insight into biological mechanisms that may also be relevant in human disease. Reverse genomic translation begins with observations made through human genomic studies and refines these observations through follow-up studies using model systems. The ultimate goal of these approaches is to clarify intervenable processes as targets for therapeutic development. In this review, we describe some of the approaches being taken to apply translational genomics to the study of diseases commonly encountered in the neurocritical care setting, including hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke, traumatic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and status epilepticus, utilizing both forward and reverse genomic translational techniques. Further, we highlight approaches in the field that could be applied in neurocritical care to improve our ability to identify new treatment modalities as well as to provide important information to patients about risk and prognosis.

We next provide a synthesis of future challenges and considerations in the development and application of healthcare robots. We organize these considerations using a socio-ecological perspective and discuss considerations at the individual, care partner, community healthcare, and healthcare policy levels. RECENT FINDINGS: Older adults are the fastest growing segment of the US population. Age-related changes and challenges can present difficulties, for older adults want to age healthily and maintain independence. Technology, specifically healthcare robots, has potential to provide health supports to older adults. These supports span widely across the physical, cognitive, and social aspects of healthy aging. SUMMARY: Our review suggests that while healthcare robotics has potential to revolutionize the way in which older adults manage their health, there are many challenges such as clinical effectiveness, technology acceptance, health informatics, and healthcare policy and ethics. Addressing these challenges at all levels of the healthcare system will help ensure that healthcare robotics promote healthy aging and are applied safely, effectively, and reliably.","Mois, George; Beer, Jenay M.",Curr Geriatr Rep,368,1

In this paper, we provide an overview of causes, evaluation, treatment, and consequences of RSE and SRSE, reflecting the lack of high-quality evidence to inform therapeutic approach. SOURCES: This is a narrative review based on personal practice and experience. Nevertheless, we searched MEDLINE (using PubMed and OvidSP vendors) and Cochrane central register of controlled trials, using appropriate keywords to incorporate recent evidence. RESULTS: Refractory status epilepticus is commonly defined as an acute convulsive seizure that fails to respond to two or more anti-seizure medications including at least one nonbenzodiazepine drug. Super-refractory status epilepticus is a status epilepticus that continues for ≥24 hours despite anesthetic treatment, or recurs on an attempted wean of the anesthetic regimen. Both can occur in patients known to have epilepsy or de novo, with increasing recognition of autoimmune and genetic causes. Electroencephalography monitoring is essential to monitor treatment response in refractory/super-refractory status epilepticus, and to diagnose non-convulsive status epilepticus. The mainstay of treatment for these disorders includes anesthetic infusions, primarily midazolam, ketamine, and pentobarbital. Dietary, immunological, and surgical treatments are viable in selected patients. Management is challenging due to multiple acute complications and long-term adverse consequences. CONCLUSIONS: We have provided a synopsis of best practices for diagnosis and management of refractory/superrefractory status epilepticus and highlighted the lack of sufficient high-quality evidence to drive decision making, ending with a brief foray into avenues for future research.","Samanta, Debopam; Garrity, Lisa; Arya, Ravindra",Indian Pediatr,368,1

Data on the prevalence and frequency of these encounters are lacking and are needed to guide the creation of institutional trainings and policies to support trainees. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of resident experiences with and responses to a range of biased patient behaviors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A retrospective survey was sent via email to 331 second- and third-year internal medicine residents from 3 academic medical centers in California and North Carolina. First-year residents were excluded owing to their limited interactions with patients at the time of participant recruitment. Data were collected from August 21 to November 25, 2019. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Descriptive statistics were used to report the frequency of experience of various types of biased patient behavior, residents’ responses, the factors impeding residents’ responses, and residents’ experiences and beliefs regarding training and policies. RESULTS: Overall, 232 of 331 residents (70%) participated; 116 (50%) were women; 116 of 247 (47%) were White (participants had the option of selecting >1 race/ethnicity); and 23 (10%) identified as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer. The frequency of resident-reported experience of types of biased patient behaviors varied. The most common behaviors—belittling comments and assumption of nonphysician status—were reported to be experienced 1 or more times per week by 14% of residents (32 of 231) and 17% of residents (38 of 230), respectively. Women, Black or Latinx, and Asian residents reported experiencing biased behavior more frequently. Forty-five percent of Black or Latinx residents (17 of 38) encountered instances of explicit epithets or rejection of care. All 70 Asian residents reported experiencing inquiries into their ethnic origins. Most women residents (110 of 115 [96%]) experienced role questioning behaviors, and 87% (100 of 115) experienced sexual harassment. The need to prioritize clinical care and a sense of futility in responding were the most common factors (cited by 34% of residents [76 of 227] and 25% of residents [56 of 227], respectively) significantly impeding responses to biased behaviors. Eighty-five percent of residents (191 of 226) never reported incidents to their institution. Eighty-nine percent of residents (206 of 232) identified training and policies as necessary or very necessary. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This survey study suggests that biased patient behavior is experienced frequently by internal medicine residents. Non-White and women residents reported experiencing a disproportionate burden of these incidents. Residents’ responses rarely included institutional involvement. Residency programs and health care systems should prioritize training and policies to address biased patient behavior and support affected residents.","de Bourmont, Shalila S.; Burra, Arun; Nouri, Sarah S.; El-Farra, Neveen; Mohottige, Dinushika; Sloan, Caroline; Schaeffer, Sarah; Friedman, Jodi; Fernandez, Alicia",JAMA Netw Open,368,17

At present, there is no treatment or a safe and effective vaccine for these viruses. Hence, the development of new strategies as host-directed therapy is required. In this sense, Metformin (MET), an FDA-approved drug used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, has shown an anti-DENV effect in vitro by activating AMPK and reducing HMGCR activity. In this study, MET treatment was evaluated during in vitro and in vivo ZIKV infection and compared to MET treatment during DENV infection. Our results demonstrated that MET has a broad in vitro antiviral spectrum. MET inhibited ZIKV infection in different cell lines, but it was most effective in inhibiting DENV and yellow fever virus (YFV) infection in Huh-7 cells. However, the drug failed to protect against ZIKV infection when AG129 immunodeficient mice were used as in vivo model. Interestingly, MET increased DENV-infected male mice's survival time, reducing the severe signs of the disease. Together, these findings indicate that, although MET was an effective antiviral agent to inhibit in vitro and in vivo DENV infection, it could only inhibit in vitro ZIKV infection.","Farfan-Morales, Carlos Noe; Cordero-Rivera, Carlos Daniel; Osuna-Ramos, Juan Fidel; Monroy-Muñoz, Irma Eloisa; De Jesús-González, Luis Adrián; Muñoz-Medina, José Esteban; Hurtado-Monzón, Arianna M.; Reyes-Ruiz, José Manuel; del Ángel, Rosa María",Sci Rep,368,1

Simultaneously, chatbots are becoming increasingly popular as a way to interact with users in mobile health apps. OBJECTIVE: This study reports the user-centered design and feasibility study of a chatbot to collect linked data to support the study of individual and social overweight and obesity causes in populations. METHODS: We first studied the users’ needs and gathered users’ graphical preferences through an open survey on 52 wireframes designed by 150 design students; it also included questions about sociodemographics, diet and activity habits, the need for overweight and obesity apps, and desired functionality. We also interviewed an expert panel. We then designed and developed a chatbot. Finally, we conducted a pilot study to test feasibility. RESULTS: We collected 452 answers to the survey and interviewed 4 specialists. Based on this research, we developed a Telegram chatbot named Wakamola structured in six sections: personal, diet, physical activity, social network, user's status score, and project information. We defined a user's status score as a normalized sum (0-100) of scores about diet (frequency of eating 50 foods), physical activity, BMI, and social network. We performed a pilot to evaluate the chatbot implementation among 85 healthy volunteers. Of 74 participants who completed all sections, we found 8 underweight people (11%), 5 overweight people (7%), and no obesity cases. The mean BMI was 21.4 kg/m(2) (normal weight). The most consumed foods were olive oil, milk and derivatives, cereals, vegetables, and fruits. People walked 10 minutes on 5.8 days per week, slept 7.02 hours per day, and were sitting 30.57 hours per week. Moreover, we were able to create a social network with 74 users, 178 relations, and 12 communities. CONCLUSIONS: The Telegram chatbot Wakamola is a feasible tool to collect data from a population about sociodemographics, diet patterns, physical activity, BMI, and specific diseases. Besides, the chatbot allows the connection of users in a social network to study overweight and obesity causes from both individual and social perspectives.","Asensio-Cuesta, Sabina; Blanes-Selva, Vicent; Conejero, J Alberto; Frigola, Ana; Portolés, Manuel G; Merino-Torres, Juan Francisco; Rubio Almanza, Matilde; Syed-Abdul, Shabbir; Li, Yu-Chuan (Jack); Vilar-Mateo, Ruth; Fernandez-Luque, Luis; García-Gómez, Juan M",JMIR Med Inform,368,17

To investigate if such potential biomarkers could be found for CHD inhomogeneous, we combined traditional Chinese medicine based diagnosis with untargeted and targeted metabolomics analyses. Shi and Xu patient subtype groups of CHD with angina pectoris were identified. Different metabolites including lipids, fatty acids and amino acids were further analyzed with targeted metabolomics and mapped to disease-related pathways. The long-chain unsaturated lipids ceramides metabolism, bile acid metabolism were differentially affected in the Xu subtype groups. While, Shi-subtype patients seemed to show inflammation, anomalous levels of bioactive phospholipids and antioxidant molecules. Furthermore, variations in the endothelial damage response and energy metabolism found based on ELISA analysis are the key divergence points between different CHD subtypes. The results showed Xu subtype patients might benefit from long-chain unsaturated lipids ceramides as therapeutic targets. Shi subtype patients might benefit more from levels of polyunsaturated fatty acid consumption and treatments that help in restoring energy balance. Metabolic differences can be essential for treatment protocols. Thus, patient group specific differences can serve as important information to refine current treatment approaches in a personalized manner.","Guo, Na; Wang, Peili; Yang, Jiaying; Yang, Xiaofang; van der Voet, Monique; Wildwater, Marjolein; Wei, Junying; Tang, Xuan; Wang, Mei; Yang, Hongjun",Front Pharmacol,368,22

This study attempts to identify high risk areas of schistosomiasis in China by using information value and machine learning. METHODS: The local case distribution from schistosomiasis surveillance data in China between 2005 and 2019 was assessed based on 19 variables including climate, geography, and social economy. Seven models were built in three categories including information value (IV), three machine learning models [logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), generalized boosted model (GBM)], and three coupled models (IV + LR, IV + RF, IV + GBM). Accuracy, area under the curve (AUC), and F1-score were used to evaluate the prediction performance of the models. The optimal model was selected to predict the risk distribution for schistosomiasis. RESULTS: There is a more prone to schistosomiasis epidemic provided that paddy fields, grasslands, less than 2.5 km from the waterway, annual average temperature of 11.5–19.0 °C, annual average rainfall of 1000–1550 mm. IV + GBM had the highest prediction effect (accuracy = 0.878, AUC = 0.902, F1 = 0.920) compared with the other six models. The results of IV + GBM showed that the risk areas are mainly distributed in the coastal regions of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the Poyang Lake region, and the Dongting Lake region. High-risk areas are primarily distributed in eastern Changde, western Yueyang, northeastern Yiyang, middle Changsha of Hunan province; southern Jiujiang, northern Nanchang, northeastern Shangrao, eastern Yichun in Jiangxi province; southern Jingzhou, southern Xiantao, middle Wuhan in Hubei province; southern Anqing, northwestern Guichi, eastern Wuhu in Anhui province; middle Meishan, northern Leshan, and the middle of Liangshan in Sichuan province. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of schistosomiasis transmission in China still exists, with high-risk areas relatively concentrated in the coastal regions of the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Coupled models of IV and machine learning provide for effective analysis and prediction, forming a scientific basis for evidence-lead surveillance and control.

MIL9 and Pseudomonas putida KT2440. The presented biocatalysis system performs under environmentally benign conditions, features a straightforward and inexpensive procedure and possesses a high substrate conversion and product yield. The capacity of gram‐scale production was reached in the simple shake‐flask cultivation. The template substrates (pyridine, pyrazine, 2‐aminopyrimidine) have been converted into pyridine‐1‐oxide, pyrazine‐1‐oxide and 2‐aminopyrimidine‐1‐oxide in product titres of 18.0, 19.1 and 18.3 g l(‐1), respectively. To our knowledge, this is the highest reported productivity of aromatic N‐oxides using biocatalysis methods. Moreover, comparing to the chemical method of aromatic N‐oxides synthesis based on meta‐chloroperoxybenzoic acid, the developed approach is applicable for a regioselective oxidation that is an additional advantageous option in the preparation of the anticipated N‐oxides.","Petkevičius, Vytautas; Vaitekūnas, Justas; Gasparavičiūtė, Renata; Tauraitė, Daiva; Meškys, Rolandas",Microb Biotechnol,368,12

The mouth links the external environment to the gut and lungs. In the present study, compared to that observed in healthy controls (HCs), AS saliva was depleted of Bacilli such as Streptococcus, enriched with Clostridia such as Veillonellaceae, and enriched with opportunistic pathogens from Proteobacteria such as Brucella spp. and Campylobacter concisus. AS saliva was enriched with 16 cytokines related to inflammation, such as soluble IL-6 receptor α (sIL-6Rα), interleukin 2 (IL-2), IL-10, IL-11, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-20, IL-26, IL-27, IL-28A, IL-29, alpha 2 interferon (IFN-α2), IFN-β, and matrix metalloproteinase 3 (MMP-3). AS saliva was also enriched with hazardous compounds, such as cadaverine and putrescine. AS-altered salivary bacteria, compounds, and cytokines are closely linked with disease indicators. Oral cleaning reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and hazardous compounds in AS saliva compared with HC saliva. AS saliva induced the production of more proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-12p70 and IL-8, by THP-1 monocyte-derived macrophages, than did HC saliva. The results highlight the importance of salivary microbes, cytokines, and compounds in the development and treatment of AS and provide new ideas for the pathogenesis and treatment of AS. IMPORTANCE Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) affects as much as 0.32% of the population in some districts and causes work disability in one-third of these patients. Microbes are considered to play important roles in AS pathogenesis, and the mouth links the environment to the lungs and the gut. Our results showed that opportunistic pathogens such as Brucella and Campylobacter are enriched in the saliva of AS patients with ankylosing spondylitis. In addition, proinflammatory cytokines and hazardous materials such as putrescine were also enriched in the saliva of AS patients.[AQ1 sentence edit] Interestingly, the opportunistic pathogens and hazardous materials detected in the saliva of AS patients were associated with disease indexes. The saliva of AS patients was shown to induce immune cells to secrete proinflammatory cytokines in vitro. Reducing the levels of salivary microbes can significantly reduce the hazardous materials present in the saliva of AS patients. Our results provide a new perspective on the potential role of salivary microbes, cytokines, and hazardous compounds in the pathogenesis and treatment of AS.","Lv, Longxian; Jiang, Huiyong; Yan, Ren; Xu, Danyi; Wang, Kaicen; Wang, Qiangqiang; Chen, Xiaoxiao; Li, Lanjuan",,368,12

This study aimed to evaluate the factors associated with transient hypothyroxinemia of prematurity (THOP) in newborns admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). METHOD: This is a single center, retrospective, case-control study. Premature newborns, between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation, hospitalised between January 2014–December 2019 in Istanbul University-Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine NICU were analyzed through their medical records. Thyroid function tests were routinely performed between the 10th and 20th days of postnatal life and were evaluated according to the gestational age references. Thirty six possible associated factors (prenatal and postnatal parameters, medical treatments, clinical diagnoses and applications in NICU) were searched in the patient group with THOP (n = 71) and the control group with euthyroid prematures (n = 73). The factors for THOP were identified by univariate analysis, followed by multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Mean gestational ages of the study and the control groups were 29.7 ± 2.48 and 30.5 ± 2.30 weeks, respectively (p = 0.606). The birth weight, small for gestational age (SGA), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), congenital heart disease (CHD) were found to be the possible associated factors for THOP in the univariate analysis and CHD (p = 0.007, odds ratio [OR]:4.9, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5–15.8), BW (p = 0.004, OR:0.999, 95% CI: 0.9–1.0) and SGA (p = 0.010, OR:4.6, 95% CI: 1.4–14.7) were found to be factors associated with THOP determined by univariate logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSİONS: Although some treatment practices might have had direct effects on pituitary–thyroid axis, related with the severity of the newborn clinical conditions, non of them was found to be a associated factor for THOP. However, CHD and SGA may be considered as associated factors with THOP detected in preterm infants.","Yilmaz, Aslan; Ozer, Yavuz; Kaya, Nesrin; Turan, Hande; Acar, Hazal Cansu; Ercan, Oya; Perk, Yildiz; Evliyaoglu, Olcay; Vural, Mehmet",BMC Pediatr,368,27

Several studies have found that β-catenin can mediate immune evasion in cancer and promote anti-inflammatory features of antigen-presenting dendritic cells. Many small molecular compounds that inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling are currently in clinical development, but none have entered routine clinical use. New inhibitors of β-catenin signaling are consequently desirable. Here, we have tested, in monocyte-derived dendritic cells, the effects of two small molecular compounds, axitinib and nitazoxanide, that previously have been discovered to inhibit β-catenin signaling in colon cancer cells. Immature and lipopolysaccharide-matured dendritic cells prepared from healthy blood donor buffy coats were stimulated with 6-bromoindirubin-3′-oxime (6-BIO) to boost basal β-catenin activity, and the effects of axitinib and nitazoxanide were compared with the commercial β-catenin inhibitor ICG-001. Assays, including genome-wide RNA-sequencing, indicated that neither axitinib nor nitazoxanide demonstrated considerable β-catenin inhibition. Both compounds were found to be less toxic to monocyte-derived dendritic cells than either 6-BIO or ICG-001. Axitinib stimulated several aspects of dendritic cell function, such as IL12-p70 secretion, and counteracted IL-10 secretion, according to the present study. However, neither axitinib nor nitazoxanide were found to be efficient β-catenin inhibitors in monocyte-derived dendritic cells.","Azeem, Waqas; Bakke, Ragnhild Maukon; Gabriel, Benjamin; Appel, Silke; Øyan, Anne Margrete; Kalland, Karl-Henning",Biomedicines,368,27

Targeting the construction sector could reach workers from high risk populations. METHODS: The RE-AIM framework was used to evaluate Test@Work, a workplace HIV testing intervention for construction workers implemented at 21 events (10 companies) in the UK. Test@Work had three components: 1) an online health toolkit to inform managers about health screening and HIV testing; 2) general health checks; and 3) opt-in HIV consultation and testing. Quantitative data were collected using registration and exit questionnaires with workers (n = 426) and pre/post-event questionnaires with managers (n = 15), with qualitative analysis of free text responses. RESULTS: Reach 426 individuals had health checks. Participants were broadly representative of the UK construction workforce, but with a higher proportion of permanent workers. Most workers reported being in good health but also believed their work had an adverse impact on their health. Effectiveness: 97% of health check participants opted to have a consultation about sexual health (n = 413) and 82% had an HIV test (n = 348), of whom 78% had not previously been tested. All HIV tests were non-reactive. HIV testing at work was considered acceptable by most participants. Participants reported learning new things about their health (74%), said they would make changes as a result (70%) and felt confident of success (median score 8/10). Adoption: Recruitment of companies was challenging and time consuming. Seven of the participating companies were very large, employing over 1000 workers, which is atypical of construction generally. Implementation: All events were completed as planned and were considered successful by all parties. Maintenance: All managers would arrange further events if they were offered them. Six managers incorporated sexual health awareness into their health programmes, but this was not possible for many as health agendas were set centrally by their organisations. CONCLUSIONS: Opt-in HIV testing, when embedded within a general health check, has high uptake and acceptability in the UK construction sector, and reaches individuals at risk for HIV who may not otherwise attend for testing. Cost-effectiveness of this approach is yet to be determined. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04292002.

The diversity of waterborne diseases and their severity is greatest in tropical environments. Since most of the countries in tropical climates are underdeveloped, with large populations that are undernourished, ill‐housed, with poor medical services, waterborne diseases may have a much greater effect on public health in the tropics than in temperate areas. Universally, tropical areas accept water maximum contaminant levels developed by temperate nations, despite the obvious differences in tropical climates. High densities of total and fecal coliform bacteria have been detected in pristine streams and in groundwater samples collected from many tropical parts of the world, even in epiphytic vegetation 10 m above ground in the rain forest of Puerto Rico. Nucleic acid (DNA) analyses of Escherichia coli from pristine tropical environs has indicated that they are identical to clinical isolates of E. coli. Many tropical source waters have been shown to have enteric pathogens in the complete absence of coliforms. Diffusion chamber studies with E. coli at several tropical sites reveal that this bacterium can survive indefinitely in most freshwaters in Puerto Rico. An evaluation of methods for the enumeration of fecal coliforms showed that currently used media have poor reliability as a result of large numbers of false positive and false negative results when applied to tropical water samples. Total and fecal coliform bacteria are not reliable indicators of recent biological contamination of waters in tropical areas. Fecal streptococci and coliphages in tropical waters violate the same underlying assumptions of indicator assays as the coliforms. Anaerobic bacteria like Bifidobacterium spp. and Clostridium perfringens show some promise in terms of survival, but not in ease of enumeration and media specificity. The best course at present lies in using current techniques for direct enumeration of pathogens by fluorescent staining and nucleic acid analysis, and developing tropical maximum contaminant levels for certain resistant pathogens in tropical waters.","Hazen, Terry C.",,368,1

It is a well known NP-Hard problem with many practical applications. In this contribution we assume that the capacity of a bin can be understood in a flexible way (so it may allow some overload) thus leading to a fuzzy version of the VSCBPP with fuzzy constraints. We solve the proposed fuzzy VSCBPP by using the parametric approach based on [Formula: see text]-cuts, thus defining a set of related crisp problems. By using three different solving algorithms and several instances, we explore the impact of different degrees of relaxation not only in terms of cost, but also in the structure of the solutions.","Herrera-Franklin, Jorge; Rosete, Alejandro; García-Borroto, Milton; Cruz-Corona, Carlos; Pelta, David A.",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,368,1

Correctness proofs of such structures involve subtle reasoning about bounds on probabilities of getting certain outcomes. Because of these subtleties, a number of unsound arguments in such proofs have been made over the years. In this work, we address the challenge of building rigorous and reusable computer-assisted proofs about probabilistic specifications of AMQs. We describe the framework for systematic decomposition of AMQs and their properties into a series of interfaces and reusable components. We implement our framework as a library in the Coq proof assistant and showcase it by encoding in it a number of non-trivial AMQs, such as Bloom filters, counting filters, quotient filters and blocked constructions, and mechanising the proofs of their probabilistic specifications. We demonstrate how AMQs encoded in our framework guarantee the absence of false negatives by construction. We also show how the proofs about probabilities of false positives for complex AMQs can be obtained by means of verified reduction to the implementations of their simpler counterparts. Finally, we provide a library of domain-specific theorems and tactics that allow a high degree of automation in probabilistic proofs.","Gopinathan, Kiran; Sergey, Ilya",Computer Aided Verification,368,12

The COVID-19 pandemic has required us to adapt how we communicate with patients’ families due to hospital visiting restrictions. In an era where tragically deterioration and death have been much more commonplace, we looked to identify areas where junior doctors felt their communication skills could be improved, and implemented a teaching programme to deliver this. METHODS: Pre-teaching questionnaires were distributed to a range of grades of junior doctors working in University Hospital of Llandough, Cardiff. The questionnaires were distributed at the beginning of June 2020, after 3 months of working in pandemic conditions. A teaching session on telephone and video communication skills was delivered by a local palliative care consultant. Post-teaching, a repeat questionnaire was undertaken to assess response and identify key learning points. RESULTS: Pre-teaching, 100% of the 22 respondents had had to participate in difficult conversations over the phone, 82% had had no formal phone based communication skills training and 81.82% felt some form of formal teaching would be helpful. Post-teaching, 12 junior doctors provided feedback with an average 37% increase in confidence to undertake difficult conversations. Key learning points from the session highlighted the importance of preparation, regularly updating the family to build trust and rapport, and integrating family updates via tele-communication into daily ward life. CONCLUSIONS: Education around telephone communication skills is critical to enable us to adapt our skills in accordance with the demands of the pandemic, to continue to support relatives and to engage with technology with confidence. Increased preparation is required to navigate difficult conversations via technology, and successful communication requires clinicians to take responsibility for initiating regular family updates.","Pyrke, B; Abdalla, B; Cartwright, G; Figg, K; Murphy, E; Tuck, A; White, H",Age Ageing,368,1

A quality-improvement discharge survey (QIS) identified potential barriers to follow-up as distance from the clinic, transportation, and time off work. This study compares follow-up rates before and after the QIS was administered and correlates them with patients’ self-identified barriers. METHODS: Following IRB approval, a retrospective chart review was conducted using electronic medical records of adult burn-center admits who responded to the QIS and were discharged between September 2019 and July 2020. Controls were burn-center admits discharged from 2016–2018, prior to the survey period. Exclusions included patients with non-burn injuries, and those who died in the hospital were transferred to another hospital, did not require follow-up, or followed up elsewhere. Data analysis was conducted using chi-square, t-test, and logistic regression models. RESULTS: The post-survey group includes 272 patients (mean age 47 ± 16.8, 201 males (73.6%), mean burn size (TBSA) of 9.3% ± 9.6%). The pre-survey control group includes 878 patients (mean age 45.1 ± 16.8 years, 646 males (73.6%), mean burn size (TBSA) 10.16 ± 11.7%). Compared to the pre-survey group, post-survey patients had a lower frequency of missed appointments (MA) (47.3% post vs. 56% pre), but worse overall follow-up rates (63.7% post vs. 74.5% pre). Per multivariate analysis, different factors were associated with follow-up and MA in the two groups (Table 1). Rates of follow-up and MA were not significantly different before and after the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who were surveyed to identify barriers to follow-up had fewer missed appointments but worse overall follow-up rates. Patients fail to follow up due to homelessness, substance dependence, and distance to the hospital. These findings are consistent with patients’ self-identified barriers to follow-up in a QI survey.

The feasibility of virtual antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) loading specifically with digital QTc electrocardiographic monitoring (EM) in conjunction with telemedicine video visits is not well established. We tested the hypothesis that existing digital health technologies and virtual communication platforms could provide EM and support medically guided AAD loading for patients with symptomatic tachyarrhythmia in the ambulatory setting, while reducing physical contact between patient and healthcare system. A prospective pilot, case series approved by the institutional ethics committee, entailing three subjects with symptomatic arrhythmia during the COVID-19 pandemic who were enrolled for virtual AAD loading at home. Clinicians met with participants twice daily via video visits conducted after QTc analysis (Kardia 6L mobile sensor) and telemetry review (Mobile Cardiac Outpatient Telemetry of silent arrhythmias). Participants received direct instruction to either terminate the study or proceed with the next single dose of AAD. All participants completed contactless loading of 5 AAD doses, without untoward event. Scheduled video visits allowed dialogue and participant counseling where decision making was guided by remote review of EM. Participant adherence with transmissions and scheduled visits was 98.3%; a single electrocardiogram was delayed beyond the two-hours-post-dose schedule. This virtual approach reduced overall expenditures based on retrospective comparison with previous AAD load hospitalizations. We found that a ‘virtual hospitalization’ for AAD loading with remote electrocardiographic monitoring and twice daily virtual rounding is feasible using existing digital health technologies.","Shah, Rajan L; Kapoor, Ridhima; Bonnett, Colleen; Ottoboni, Linda K; Tacklind, Christine; Tsiperfal, Angela; Perez, Marco V",Eur Heart J Digit Health,368,16

Interventions on motor skills are effective in the short term to improve MC, therefore the objectives of this study were (1) to investigate the effect of a short six-week program on levels of motor competence in preschool children, and (2) to examine the effects of gender-based intervention. A total of 156 preschool children (5.20 ± 0.54 years old) from Lugo (Spain) participated. A quasi-experimental pre–post-test design was used with a control group of 76 students. The Movement Assessment Battery for Children—2nd Edition (MABC-2) was used to collect the data. Significant differences between the control and experimental groups were found after the intervention program in aiming and catching (p < 0.001), balance (p < 0.001), the total score of eight tests (p < 0.001), and total percentile score (p < 0.001). The results regarding gender in the experimental group showed a reduction in differences with respect to the initial results except in aiming and catching, where scores were higher in boys. The data suggest that the application of specific intervention programs in MC could positively influence the improvement of MC in preschool children, thus reducing differences between genders.","Navarro-Patón, Rubén; Brito-Ballester, Julien; Villa, Silvia Pueyo; Anaya, Vanessa; Mecías-Calvo, Marcos",Int J Environ Res Public Health,368,24

Our department integrated virtual assessment into the incoming referral pathway to enable continuation of high-quality care. This study aimed to assess any potential efficiency benefit of this change in service whilst ensuring no compromise to clinical outcomes. METHOD: A prospective analysis was undertaken of all hand fractures referred virtually during a seven-week period starting at the initiation of national lockdown. Cost analysis using NHS reference costs, inflated to 2019/20 prices, was performed. Clinical performance was assessed using the British Society for Surgery for the Hand (BSSH) Standards for Open and Closed Hand Fractures. RESULTS: Seventy-six hand fractures were referred; FTF attendance was avoided in 35 cases, with an estimated per-patient cost saving of £179.16. Of the 33 patients who attended FTF, 13 achieved same day non-operative treatment; 20 underwent operative intervention with 95% compliance to BSSH standards. No complications occurred. CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot model demonstrates potentially significant cost savings of £6270 over a relatively short period, as well as clinical non-inferiority. This supports sustained integration of virtual patient assessment in the ‘new normal’. Further work across all disciplines is needed to define acceptable limits of telemedicine and new avenues for potential benefit.","Roberts, N; Totty, J; Pinder, R",Br J Surg,368,24

Understanding the pathogenesis of the disease and host immune responses will facilitate the discovery of therapeutic targets and better management of infected patients. Metabolomics technology can provide an unbiased tool to explore metabolic perturbation. METHODS: Twenty-six healthy controls and 50 COVID-19 patients with mild, moderate, and severe symptoms in the Fifth Medical Center of PLA General Hospital from January 22 to February 16, 2020 were recruited into the study. Fasting blood samples were collected and subject to metabolomics analysis by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. Metabolite abundance was measured by peak area and was log-transformed before statistical analysis. The principal component analysis, different expression analysis, and metabolic pathway analysis were performed using R package. Co-regulated metabolites and their associations with clinical indices were identified by the weighted correlation network analysis and Spearman correlation coefficients. The potential metabolite biomarkers were analyzed using a random forest model. RESULTS: We uncovered over 100 metabolites that were associated with COVID-19 disease and many of them correlated with disease severity. Sets of highly correlated metabolites were identified and their correlations with clinical indices were presented. Further analyses linked the differential metabolites with biochemical reactions, metabolic pathways, and biomedical MeSH terms, offering contextual insights into disease pathogenesis and host responses. Finally, a panel of metabolites was discovered to be able to discriminate COVID-19 patients from healthy controls, and also another list for mild against more severe cases. Our findings showed that in COVID-19 patients, citrate cycle, sphingosine 1-phosphate in sphingolipid metabolism, and steroid hormone biosynthesis were downregulated, while purine metabolism and tryptophan metabolism were disturbed. CONCLUSION: This study discovered key metabolites as well as their related biological and medical concepts pertaining to COVID-19 pathogenesis and host immune response, which will facilitate the selection of potential biomarkers for prognosis and discovery of therapeutic targets.","Li, Bo-Wen; Fan, Xing; Cao, Wen-Jing; Tian, He; Wang, Si-Yu; Zhang, Ji-Yuan; Lam, Sin Man; Song, Jin-Wen; Zhang, Chao; Zhang, Shao-Hua; Xu, Zhe; Xu, Ruo-Nan; Fu, Jun-Liang; Huang, Lei; Jiang, Tian-Jun; Shi, Ming; Wang, Fu-Sheng; Shui, Guang-Hou",,368,1

Data were collected from two conditions: individuals in the experienced condition only responded to transitions they had experienced; individuals in the hypothetical condition provided ratings only for transitions they had not experienced. Participants rated the likelihood and typical age of occurrence, importance, transitional impact, and valence for an individualized set of condition-appropriate events. We found that script-consistent events were considered more normative and positive than script-divergent events. The two types of events, however, differed little in terms of importance or transitional impact. We conclude by arguing that although script-consistent and script-divergent transitions have much in common from a mnemonic perspective, the distinction is still warranted in the context of lifetime planning and evaluation.","Shi, Liangzi; Brown, Norman R.",Front Psychol,368,20

In this case report, we aim to present a case of an ilio-iliac AVF with an atypical clinical presentation. METHODS Relevant medical data were collected from hospital database. RESULTS The patient is a 77-year-old woman, with a relevant medical history of a temporally remote hysterectomy. She developed an exuberant unilateral right leg edema and was diagnosed with a femoro-iliac deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and started on anticoagulation and daily use of elastic compression stockings. No improvement in leg edema was evident, and she reported painful complaints refractory to medication. She also progressively developed right foot numbness and foot drop. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed to exclude any compressive or paraneoplastic syndrome, with no remarkable findings other than common iliac vein (CIV) occlusion. As the patient's symptoms continued to worsen, a new CTA was performed 5 months later, which revealed an ilio-iliac AVF that was confirmed by angiography. After 2 ineffective attempts to embolize AVF afferents, we chose to completely embolize the arterial component of the AVF with Helix EV3 coils and Onyx glue (Covidien, Irvine, CA, USA). CIV recanalization and deployment of a Venovo stent (Bard Inc, Tempe, AZ, USA) was also performed. The final angiograms showed exclusion of the AVF and rapid venous flow through the stent. There was progressive improvement of edema and pain but little improvement of foot drop. CONCLUSION AVF etiology and mechanism of neurologic deficits are controversial, with multiple possible explanations. Endovascular treatment modalities are promising a safer and more efficient approach when compared with open surgery. Our experience in this case was encouraging, but long-term results are currently lacking.","Coelho, Andreia; Brandão, Pedro; Lobo, Miguel; Lojo, Ignatio; Canedo, Alexandra",Annals of vascular surgery,368,1

OBJECTIVES The current cross-sectional study characterizes post COVID-19 sequelae and persistent symptoms in patients in an outpatient rehabilitation program. METHODS Thirty patients [16 post-ICU and 14 non-ICU; median age = 54(43.8-62) years; 19 men] presenting sequelae and/or persistent symptoms (>3 months after acute COVID-19) were selected of 41 patients referred for neurorehabilitation. Patients underwent physical, neuropsychological and respiratory evaluation and assessment of impact of fatigue and quality of life. RESULTS The main reasons for referral to rehabilitation were: fatigue (86.6%), dyspnea (66.7%), subjective cognitive impairment (46.7%) and neurological sequelae (33.3%). Post-ICU patient presented sequelae of critical illness myopathy and polyneuropathy, stroke and encephalopathy and lower forced vital capacity compared to non-ICU patients. Cognitive impairment was found in 63.3% of patients, with a similar profile in both sub-groups. Increased physical fatigue, anxiety and depression and low quality of life were prevalent irrespective of acute COVID-19 severity. CONCLUSIONS The variability of post COVID-19 physical and neuropsychological impairment requires a complex screening process both in ICU and non-ICU patients. The high impact of persistent symptoms on daily life activities and quality of life, regardless of acute infection severity, indicate need for rehabilitation.","Albu, Sergiu; Zozaya, Nicolas Rivas; Murillo, Narda; Garcia-Molina, Alberto; Chacón, Cristian Andres Figueroa; Kumru, Hatice",NeuroRehabilitation,368,12

However, its protective effect on gentamicin-induced ototoxicity remains unexplored. Therefore, here, we aimed to investigate the otoprotective effect of THSG on gentamicin-induced apoptosis in mouse cochlear UB/OC-2 cells. We evaluated the effect of gentamicin and THSG on the ROS level, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, mitochondrial membrane potential, nuclear condensation, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release, and the expression of apoptosis-related proteins was assessed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying its preventive effects. The findings demonstrated that gentamicin increased ROS generation, LDH release, and promoted apoptotic cell death in UB/OC-2 cells. However, THSG treatment reversed these effects by suppressing ROS production and downregulating the mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway. Additionally, it increased the SOD activity, decreased the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, alleviated the levels of the apoptotic cells, and impaired cytotoxicity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate that THSG could be a potential therapeutic option to attenuate gentamicin-induced ototoxicity.","Wen, Yu-Hsuan; Lin, Jia-Ni; Wu, Rong-Shuan; Yu, Szu-Hui; Hsu, Chuan-Jen; Tseng, Guo-Fang; Wu, Hung-Pin",Molecules,368,5

A phylogenetic analysis of 23 nebovirus RdRp fragments showed that these strains were closely related to Nebraska-like (NB-like) strains but were all located in a unique large branch. Moreover, a phylogenetic analysis of the 18 complete VP1 sequences from this study revealed that 14 strains belonged to lineage 1 and 4 strains belonged to lineage 3.

While initially perceived as being a solely restrictive procedure, it is now theorized to have additional hormonal effects (primarily the reduction of circulating levels of plasma ghrelin). However, there is limited supporting evidence for this claim. Therefore, the purpose of our study is to conduct a systematic review of the literature to clarify the effects of LSG on modulation of postoperative ghrelin concentrations. A comprehensive literature search for published or unpublished studies of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and ghrelin written in English prior to February 2013 was performed using Pubmed, EMBASE, the Cochrane database, and Scopus. Gray literature was also searched through Google. Inclusion criteria for searches were: randomized controlled trials, non-randomized clinical trials, retrospective and prospective cohort studies, or case series.

Pooled analysis of ghrelin levels at 3, 6, and 12 months showed a significant reduction in circulating levels. Our systematic review shows that LSG has a significant effect on ghrelin levels, leading to considerable reduction in circulation levels following surgery. Further research and standardization is necessary to clearly establish a causative relationship between LSG and reduction of circulating ghrelin levels.","Anderson, Blaire; Switzer, Noah J; Almamar, Ahmad; Shi, Xinzhe; Birch, Daniel W; Karmali, Shahzeer",Obesity surgery,368,5

RESULTS Physiological uptake was seen in 10/38 pNETs (SUV(max) range, mean±SD and median in HUP and BT: 2.4-12.7, 5.9±3.2 and 4.6; 3.8-6.6, 6.6±2.5 and 5.6, respectively). A total of 18/38 showed high uptake (SUV(max) range, mean±SD and median in HUP and BT: 6.9-50, 26.9±13.5 and 27; 10-151, 32.2±36 and 19.4, respectively) with abnormal MI results. Among 10/38 patients we observed a total of n=15 discordant findings between PET/CT and MI: two lesions detected by MI did not correspond to any pathologial uptake on PET/CT, five suspicious uptake in the HUP did not correspond to any abnormal finding on MI, one HUP suspicious uptake correspondend to a lymphadenopaty on MI and seven suspicious BT uptake correspondend to calcification (1/6), cystic lesions (3/6), lesion different form the one detected by PET/CT (1/6) or negative findings (2/6) on MI. Among the 100 patients with non-pNETs, 97 showed homogeneous uptake and three had suspicious pancreatic uptake without concordant findings on MI. CONCLUSION Physiological pancreatic uptake of (68)Ga-DOTATATE showed low SUV(max), whereas tumours showed higher SUV(max); this is in agreement with previously published data. Equivocal findings showed SUV(max) in the grey area between physiological and pathological ranges, and for these lesions MI and histological confirmation are required for final diagnosis.","Mapelli, Paola; Tam, Henry H; Sharma, Rohini; Aboagye, Eric O; Al-Nahhas, Adil",Nuclear medicine communications,368,31

Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of flow diverters in the treatment of middle cerebral artery bifurcation aneurysms and to analyze midterm angiographic patterns of regional flow modifications for safety and clinical outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS Consecutive patients treated from January 2010 to December 2014 by the authors by using endovascular flow-diverting stents for MCA bifurcation aneurysms were evaluated retrospectively with prospectively maintained data. All patients had been followed for at least 12 months after treatment, with at least 2 control angiograms; regional flow-related angiographic modifications were registered by using a new angiographic outcome scale for flow diverters. Data were analyzed with emphasis on procedure-related events, angiographic results, and clinical outcome. RESULTS Fifty-eight patients were included in the study, with 63 MCA bifurcation aneurysms; 13 of these were large and giant. Pretreatment mRS was 0 for 12 patients (20.7%), 1 for 41 (70.7%), and 2 for 5 patients (8.6%). Six-month control revealed mRS 0-2 for 57 (98.3%) patients and 3 for 1 (1.7%) patient. Procedure-related morbidity and mortality were 8.6% (5/58) and 0%, respectively. From 95% of still circulating immediate postprocedure angiographic outcomes, 68% progressed to aneurysm occlusion at 6 months and 95%, to occlusion at 12 months, with a 0% aneurysm rupture rate. CONCLUSIONS Flow diverters seem to be an effective treatment alternative for complex MCA bifurcation aneurysms, with reasonable complication rates. Longer angiographic follow-ups are needed to assess the morphologic outcome; immediate subtotal occlusions do not seem to be related to rupture.","Iosif, C; Mounayer, C; Yavuz, K; Saleme, S; Geyik, S; Cekirge, H S; Saatci, I",AJNR.

Stay-at-home orders (SHO) prompted rapid upscaling of telemedicine capabilities and upskilling of providers. This study compares telemedicine usage before and after the SHO and analyzes how a Children's Center addressed challenges associated with a rapid rise in telemedicine. Methods: Data on outpatient visits across 14 specialty divisions were abstracted from the institutional electronic medical record. The 12-week study period (March 9, 2020-May 29, 2020) spanned three epochs: pre-SHO; post-SHO; reopening to in-person visits. Changes in in-person visits, video visits, and completed, cancelled, and no-show appointments were compared between three epochs. Results: A total of 4,914 outpatient pediatric specialty visits were completed, including 67% (3,296/4,914) in-person and 33% (1,618/4,914) through video. During the first two epochs encompassing the SHO, video visits increased by 4,750%. During the third epoch when the SHO was lifted, video visits decreased by 66%, with 19.4% of visits conducted through video in week 12. Overall, for outpatient video appointments, 82.8% (1,618/1,954) were completed, 9.1% (178/1,954) were cancelled, and 8.1% (158/1,954) were no-shows. The percentage of completed and no-show appointments did not differ between epochs. However, the cancellation rate decreased significantly from Epochs 1 to 3 (p = 0.008). Conclusion: A SHO was associated with a large increase in pediatric specialty video visits. Post-SHO, the percentage of pediatric specialty visits conducted through video decreased but remained higher than before the SHO. Frequent, content-rich communications, self-directed tutorials, and individualized coaching may facilitate successful increases in telemedicine use.","Howie, Flora; Kreofsky, Beth L; Ravi, Anupama; Lokken, Troy; Hoff, Mekenzie D; Fang, Jennifer L",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,368,31

This solution phase complexity impacts industries such as nuclear waste treatment, where NO2- significantly affects the solubility of other constituents present in sodium hydroxide (NaOH)-rich nuclear waste. This work provides molecular scale information into sodium nitrite (NaNO2) and NaOH ion-pairing processes to provide a physical basis for later development of thermodynamic models. Solubility isotherms of NaNO2 in aqueous mixtures with NaOH and total alkalinity were also measured. Spectroscopic characterization of these solutions utilized high-field nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) and Raman spectroscopy, with additional solution structure detailed by X-ray total scattering pairwise distribution function analysis (X-ray PDF). Despite the NO2- deformation Raman band's insensitivity to added NaOH in saturated NaNO2 solutions, 23Na and 15N NMR studies indicated the Na+ and NO2- chemical environments change likely due to ion pairing. The ion pairing correlates with a decrease in diffusion coefficient of solution species as measured by pulsed field gradient 23Na and 1H NMR. Two-dimensional correlation analyses of the 2800-4000 cm-1 Raman region and X-ray PDF indicated that saturated NaNO2 and NaOH mixtures disrupt the hydrogen network of water into a new structure where the length of the OO correlations is contracted relative to the typical H2O structure. Beyond describing the solubility of NaNO2 in a multicomponent electrolyte mixture, these results also indicate that nitrite exhibits greater ion pairing in mixtures of concentrated NaNO2 and NaOH than in comparable solutions with only NaNO2.","Graham, Trent R; Dembowski, Mateusz; Wang, Hsiu-Wen; Mergelsberg, Sebastian T; Nienhuis, Emily T; Reynolds, Jacob G; Delegard, Calvin H; Wei, Yihui; Snyder, Michelle; Leavy, Ian I; Baum, Steven R; Fountain, Matthew S; Clark, Sue B; Rosso, Kevin M; Pearce, Carolyn I",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,368,7

Some evidence suggests that infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) produces a 'cytokine storm', which is related to acute respiratory distress syndrome or multi-organ dysfunction leading to physiological deterioration and death. It is important to highlight the state of hypercoagulability that can be triggered, involving microvascular thrombosis and vascular occlusive events, which are relevant to such poor outcomes. At present, no specific antiviral drug or vaccine is available for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and current research is aimed at preventing and mitigating damage to the target organs, mainly the lungs. In seeking therapies for patients with COVID-19, immunomodulators, cytokine antagonists and early anti-coagulation therapies have been tested in attempts to reduce the mortality rate. Pentoxifylline, a non-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor widely used to improve the rheological properties of blood, has beneficial anti-inflammatory properties and can significantly reduce the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, C-reactive protein and other immunoregulators. It has also been found to exert anti-thrombotic, antioxidant and anti-fibrogenic actions. These properties could help to prevent or mitigate the inflammatory response and hypercoagulability that develop with SARS-CoV-2 infection, decreasing multi-organ dysfunction manifesting primarily as acute lung injury.","González-Pacheco, H; Amezcua-Guerra, L M; Sandoval, J; Arias-Mendoza, A",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,368,1

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Prospective observational study of adults with type 1 diabetes in our center, in whom a prescription for a flash monitoring sensor was collected. Primary outcome was change in HbA1c between 2016 and after flash monitoring. Rates of hospital admission were compared between the first year after flash monitoring and the corresponding 12-month period 2 years earlier. RESULTS Approximately half of all adults with type 1 diabetes, attending our center, collected prescriptions for flash monitoring sensors (n=2216). Median fall in HbA1c was -1 (-0.1) mmol/mol (%) (p<0.001) and was greatest in those with baseline HbA1c >75 (9.0) mmol/mol (%): -10 (-0.9) mmol/mol (%), p<0.001. 43% of those with a baseline HbA1c >53 mmol/mol (7%) experienced a ≥5 mmol/mol (0.5%) fall in HbA1c. In addition to higher HbA1c, early commencement within 1 month of NHS-funded flash monitoring (p<0.001), and male gender (p=0.013) were associated with a fall in HbA1c of ≥5 (0.5) mmol/mol (%). Socioeconomic deprivation (p=0.009) and collecting fewer than 2 sensors per month (p=0.002) were associated with lack of response. Overall, hospital admissions did not change but an increase in admissions for hypoglycemia was observed (1.1% vs 0.3%, p=0.026). CONCLUSIONS Flash monitoring is associated with reduction in HbA1c in individuals with HbA1c >58 mmol/mol. Numerous clinical features are independently associated with HbA1c response. An increase in hypoglycemia admissions occurred following flash monitoring.","Stimson, Roland H; Dover, Anna R; Ritchie, Stuart A; Wright, Rohana J; McKnight, John A; Zammitt, Nicola N; Gibb, Fraser W",BMJ open diabetes research & care,368,7

However, whether and how these particles could inhibit the growth of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells is unclear. In the present study, we prepared AgNPs with various sizes and investigated their cytotoxic effect on AML cells. We found that AgNPs could inhibit the viability of AML cells including the isolates from AML patients. AgNPs caused the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), losses of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), DNA damage and apoptosis. Both vitamin C (Vit C) and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) could completely reverse the generation of ROS upon AgNPs, however only NAC but not Vit C could protect the cells from losses of MMP, DNA damage and apoptosis thoroughly. Similar results were obtained when cells were treated with silver ions alone. As NAC was not only an antioxidant to scavenge ROS but also a silver ion chelator, these data supported the model that both generation of ROS and release of silver ions played critical roles in the AgNPs-induced cytotoxic effect against AML cells. Taken together, this work elucidated the cytotoxic effect of AgNPs on AML cells and their underlying mechanism and might have significant impact on AML treatment.","Guo, Dawei; Zhu, Lingying; Huang, Zhihai; Zhou, Haixia; Ge, Yue; Ma, Wenjuan; Wu, Jie; Zhang, Xiuyan; Zhou, Xuefeng; Zhang, Yu; Zhao, Yun; Gu, Ning",Biomaterials,368,20

However, data on the risks of COVID-19 to PWA have presented contradictory findings, with implications for asthma management. OBJECTIVE To assess the risks and management considerations of COVID-19 in people with asthma (PWA). METHOD We conducted a rapid literature review. We searched PubMed, medRxiv, LitCovid, TRIP, Google and Google Scholar for terms relating to asthma and COVID-19, and for systematic reviews related to specific management questions within our review, in April 2020. References were screened and data were extracted by one reviewer. RESULTS We extracted data from 139 references. The evidence available is limited, with some sources suggesting an under-representation of PWA in hospitalised cases and others showing an increased risk of worse outcomes in PWA, which may be associated with disease severity. Consensus broadly holds that asthma medications should be continued as usual. Almost all aspects of asthma care will be disrupted during the pandemic due not only to limits in face-to-face care but also to the fact that many of the diagnostic tools used in asthma are considered aerosol-generating procedures. Self-management and remote interventions may be of benefit for asthma care during this time but have not been tested in this context. CONCLUSIONS Evidence on COVID-19 and asthma is limited and continuing to emerge. More research is needed on the possible associations between asthma and COVID-19 infection and severity, as well as on interventions to support asthma care in light of constraints and disruptions to healthcare systems. We found no evidence regarding health inequalities, and this urgently needs to be addressed in the literature as the burdens of asthma and of COVID-19 are not equally distributed across the population.","Hartmann-Boyce, Jamie; Gunnell, James; Drake, Jonny; Otunla, Afolarin; Suklan, Jana; Schofield, Ella; Kinton, Jade; Inada-Kim, Matt; Hobbs, F D Richard; Dennison, Paddy",BMJ evidence-based medicine,368,19

Most studies have investigated short-term responses of organisms to unrealistically high concentrations of pesticides; however, chronic exposure to persistent low concentrations, which are more likely to occur in the environment, are rarely analyzed. Here, we tested the response of polyps of the Moon jellyfish Aurelia aurita, to environmental concentrations of the herbicide atrazine and the insecticide chlorpyrifos, individually and in combination, over nine weeks. We hypothesized that exposure to individual pesticides would reduce rates of asexual reproduction and alter polyps' metabolite profiles, and that the results would be more severe when polyps were exposed to the combined pesticides. Polyps survived and reproduced (through budding) in all treatments and no differences among treatments were observed. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H NMR) spectroscopy revealed no difference in profiles of polar metabolites of polyps exposed to the individual or combined pesticides. Our results suggest that A. aurita polyps are unaffected by chronic exposure to atrazine and chlorpyrifos at concentrations recommended as being protective by current Australian water quality guidelines.

Paramagnetic chemical exchange saturation transfer (paraCEST) agents are well-suited for imaging tissue pH because the basis of CEST, chemical exchange, is inherently sensitive to pH. Several previous pH-sensitive paraCEST agents were based upon with an exchanging Ln 3+ bound water molecule as the CEST antenna but this design often added additional line-broadening of the bulk water signal due to T 2 exchange. We report here a pH-sensitive paraCEST agent that lacks an inner-sphere water molecule but contains one Ln-bound -OH group for CEST activation. The Yb 3+ - complex, Yb( 1 ), displayed a single, highly-shifted CEST peak originating from the exchangeable Yb-OH proton, the frequency of which changed over the biologically relevant pH range. CEST images of phantoms ranging in pH from 6-8 demonstrate the potential of this agent for imaging pH. Initial rodent imaging studies showed that Gd( 1 ) remains in the vascular system much longer than anticipated but is cleared slowing via renal filtration.","Sherry, A Dean; Ratnakar, James; Chirayil, Sara; Funk, Alexander; Zhang, Shanrong; Queiro, J F; Geraldes, Carlos; Kovacs, Zoltan",Angewandte Chemie,368,1

However, mechanisms of unconventional secretion have been described that bypass the secretory pathway for the extracellular delivery of cytoplasmic molecules. Components of the autophagy pathway, an intracellular recycling process, have been shown to play a role in the unconventional secretion of cytoplasmic signaling proteins. Poliovirus is a lytic virus, although a few examples of apparently nonlytic spread have been documented. Real demonstration of nonlytic spread for poliovirus or any other cytoplasmic constituent thought to exit cells via unconventional secretion requires demonstration that a small amount of cell lysis in the cellular population is not responsible for the release of cytosolic material. Here, we use quantitative time-lapse microscopy to show the spread of infectious cytoplasmic material between cells in the absence of lysis. siRNA-mediated depletion of autophagy protein LC3 reduced nonlytic intercellular viral transfer. Conversely, pharmacological stimulation of the autophagy pathway caused more rapid viral spread in tissue culture and greater pathogenicity in mice. Thus, the unconventional secretion of infectious material in the absence of cell lysis is enabled by components of the autophagy pathway. It is likely that other nonenveloped viruses also use this pathway for nonlytic intercellular spread to affect pathogenesis in infected hosts.","Bird, Sara Whitney; Maynard, Nathaniel D; Covert, Markus W; Kirkegaard, Karla",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,368,1

Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), a primary inhibitor of tissue-type and urokinase-type plasminogen activators (tPA and uPA, respectively), plays a critical role in the development of fibrosis. In this study, we explored the therapeutic potential of an orally effective small molecule PAI-1 inhibitor, TM5275, in a model of lung fibrosis induced by transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), the most potent and ubiquitous profibrogenic cytokine, and in human lung fibroblasts (CCL-210 cells). The results show that an intranasal instillation of AdTGF-β1(223/225), an adenovirus expressing constitutively active TGF-β1, increased the expression of PAI-1 and induced fibrosis in murine lung tissue. On the other hand, treating mice with 40 mg/kg of TM5275 for 10 days, starting 4 days after the instillation of AdTGF-β1(223/225), restored the activities of uPA and tPA and almost completely blocked TGF-β1-induced lung fibrosis, as shown by collagen staining, Western blotting, and the measurement of hydroxyproline. No loss of body weight was evident under these treatment conditions with TM5275. Furthermore, we show that TM5275 induced apoptosis in both myofibroblasts (TGF-β1-treated) and naive (TGF-β1-untreated) human lung fibroblasts, and this apoptosis was associated with the activation of caspase-3/7, the induction of p53, and the inhibition of α-smooth muscle actin, fibronectin, and PAI-1 expression. Such an inhibition of fibrotic responses by TM5275 occurred even in cells pretreated with TGF-β1 for 6 hours. Together, the results suggest that TM5275 is a relatively safe and potent antifibrotic agent, with therapeutic potential in fibrotic lung disease.","Huang, Wen-Tan; Vayalil, Praveen K; Miyata, Toshio; Hagood, James; Liu, Rui-Ming",American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology,368,8

Against this background, it is hardly surprising that Telepharmacy has sparked the interest of a large number of stakeholders. In this respect, the Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy has developed a definition of the concept and outlined the conditions under which Telepharmacy should operate. It has also shared its institutional stance on the subject through a position statement that states that Telepharmacy is the provision of pharmaceutical care at a distance through information and communication technologies. Telepharmacy practice includes activities such as therapeutic validation, drafting of clinical documents, provision of pharmaceutical care, therapeutic follow-up, adherence monitoring, drug education and information, coordination between healthcare providers and evaluation of health outcomes. The clinical tasks performed as part of Telepharmacy practice must adhere to a standardized procedure and revolve around the patient's clinical record. Access to Telepharmacy must be provided without discrimination. The service comprises four main activities: pharmacotherapeutic follow-up; patient and caregiver-directed education and information-dissemination; coordination with healthcare providers from the same or different hospitals; and remote informed home drug delivery. Implementation of Telepharmacy requires an adjustment of human (training and capacity-building) and technological resources (validation, interoperability, confidentiality). It must also comply with the laws and regulations in force both at a regional and a national level. Telepharmacy procedures must also be adapted to the relevant ethical standards and codes of good practice. Appropriate indicators must be used to evaluate the performance of Telepharmacy and its impact on health outcomes. According to Spanish Society of Hospital Pharmacy Telepharmacy is a necessary complementary tool to provide specialized pharmaceutical care and thereby improve health outcomes and maximize patient safety and satisfaction.","Morillo-Verdugo, Ramón; Margusino-Framiñán, Luis; Monte-Boquet, Emilio; Morell-Baladrón, Alberto; Barreda-Hernández, Dolores; Rey-Piñeiro, Xosé Manuel; Negro-Vega, Eva; Delgado-Sánchez, Olga",Farmacia hospitalaria : organo oficial de expresion cientifica de la Sociedad Espanola de Farmacia Hospitalaria,368,19

Burden increases when new documentation elements are added, but unnecessary elements are not systematically identified and removed. OBJECTIVES Reducing the burden of nursing documentation during the inpatient admission process was a key objective for a group of nurse experts who collaboratively identified essential clinical data elements to be documented by nurses in the EHR. METHODS Twelve health care organizations used a data-driven process to evaluate inpatient admission assessment data elements to identify which elements were consistently deemed essential to patient care. Processes used for the twelve organizations to reach consensus included identifying: (1) data elements that were truly essential, (2) which data elements were explicitly required during the admission process, and (3) data elements that must be documented by a registered nurse (RN). RESULT The result was an Admission Patient History Essential Clinical Dataset (APH ECD) that reduced the amount of admission documentation content by an average of 48.5%. Early adopters experienced an average reduction of more than two minutes per admission history documentation session and an average reduction in clicks of more than 30%. CONCLUSION The creation of the essential clinical dataset is an example of combining evidence from nursing practice within the EHR with a set of predefined guiding principles to decrease documentation burden for nurses. Establishing essential documentation components for the adult admission history and intake process ensures the efficient use of bedside nurses' time by collecting the right (necessary) information collected by the right person at the right time during the patient's hospital stay. Determining essential elements also provides a framework for mapping components to national standards to facilitate shareable and comparable nursing data.","Sutton, Darinda E; Fogel, Jennifer R; Giard, April S; Gulker, Lisa A; Ivory, Catherine H; Rosa, Amy M",Applied clinical informatics,368,19

Objective measures to assess contact and effective coupling of ablation energy are sought. An electrical coupling index (ECI) was devised using complex impedance at 20 kHz to perform in the presence of RF ablation and deliver information about electrical interactions between the tip electrode and its adjacent environment. ECI was derived and compared with clinical judgment, pacing threshold, electrogram amplitude, and ablation lesion depth and transmurality in a porcine model. ECI was also compared with force and displacement using ex vivo bovine myocardial muscle. Mean noncontact ECI was 97.2 ± 14.3 and increased to 145.2 ± 33.6 (p <; 0.001) in clinician assessed (CLIN) moderate contact. ECI significantly improved CLIN's prediction of the variance in pacing threshold from 48.7% to 56.8% ( ). ECI was indicative of contact force under conditions of smooth myocardium. Transmural lesions were associated with higher pre-RF (109 ± 17 versus 149 ± 25, ) and during-RF (82 ± 9 versus 101 ± 17, ) ECI levels. ECI is a tip specific, robust, correlate with contact and ablation efficacy, and can potentially add to clinical interpretation of electrical coupling during electrophysiology procedures.","Deno, D Curtis; Sih, Haris J; Miller, Stephan P; Teplitsky, Liane R; Kuenzi, Russ",IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering,368,20

The co-existence of these epidemics has necessitated care practice changes, including the use of telehealth-based encounters for the diagnosis and management of opioid use disorder (OUD). METHODS We describe the development of the ""Addiction Telehealth Program"" (ATP), a telephone-based program to reduce treatment access barriers for people with substance use disorders staying at San Francisco's COVID-19 Isolation and Quarantine (I&Q) sites. Telehealth encounters were documented in the electronic medical record and an internal tracking system for the San Francisco Department of Public Health (SFDPH) COVID-19 Containment Response. Descriptive statistics were collected on a case series of patients initiated on buprenorphine at I&Q sites and indicators of feasibility were measured. RESULTS Between April 10 and May 25, 2020, ATP consulted on the management of opioid, alcohol, GHB, marijuana, and stimulant use for 59 I&Q site guests. Twelve patients were identified with untreated OUD and newly prescribed buprenorphine. Of these, all were marginally housed, 67% were Black, and 58% had never previously been prescribed medications for OUD. Four self-directed early discharge from I&Q-1 prior to and 3 after initiating buprenorphine. Of the remaining 8 patients, 7 reported continuing to take buprenorphine at the time of I&Q discharge and 1 discontinued. No patients started on buprenorphine sustained significant adverse effects, required emergency care, or experienced overdose. CONCLUSIONS ATP demonstrates the feasibility of telephone-based management of OUD among a highly marginalized patient population in San Francisco and supports the implementation of similar programs in areas of the U.S. where access to addiction treatment is limited. Legal changes permitting the prescribing of buprenorphine via telehealth without the requirement of an in-person visit should persist beyond the COVID-19 public health emergency.","Mehtani, Nicky J; Ristau, Jessica T; Snyder, Hannah; Surlyn, Colleen; Eveland, Joanna; Smith-Bernardin, Shannon; Knight, Kelly R",Substance abuse,368,31

RESULTS Most institutes of higher education (n = 93) offered some in-person teaching in the Fall 2020 semester; most adopted masking (100%) and physical distancing (99%) mandates. Other preventive strategies included on-campus housing de-densification (58%), classroom de-densification (61%), mandated COVID-19-related training (39%), and behavioral compacts (43%). Testing strategies included entry testing (65%), testing at regular intervals (32%), population sample testing (46%), and exit testing (15%). More private than public institutes implemented intercollegiate athletics bans, behavioral compacts, and suspension clauses for noncompliance.

We generated an nsp1 mutant (nsp1-mt) that neither promoted host mRNA degradation nor suppressed host protein synthesis in expressing cells. Both a SARS-CoV mutant virus, encoding the nsp1-mt protein (SARS-CoV-mt), and a wild-type virus (SARS-CoV-WT) replicated efficiently and exhibited similar one-step growth kinetics in susceptible cells. Both viruses accumulated similar amounts of virus-specific mRNAs and nsp1 protein in infected cells, whereas the amounts of endogenous host mRNAs were clearly higher in SARS-CoV-mt-infected cells than in SARS-CoV-WT-infected cells, in both the presence and absence of actinomycin D. Further, SARS-CoV-WT replication strongly inhibited host protein synthesis, whereas host protein synthesis inhibition in SARS-CoV-mt-infected cells was not as efficient as in SARS-CoV-WT-infected cells. These data revealed that nsp1 indeed promoted host mRNA degradation and contributed to host protein translation inhibition in infected cells. Notably, SARS-CoV-mt infection, but not SARS-CoV-WT infection, induced high levels of beta interferon (IFN) mRNA accumulation and high titers of type I IFN production. These data demonstrated that SARS-CoV nsp1 suppressed host innate immune functions, including type I IFN expression, in infected cells and suggested that SARS-CoV nsp1 most probably plays a critical role in SARS-CoV virulence.","Narayanan, Krishna; Huang, Cheng; Lokugamage, Kumari; Kamitani, Wataru; Ikegami, Tetsuro; Tseng, Chien-Te K; Makino, Shinji",Journal of virology,368,22

Its most important goal is to explore differential diagnoses, in particular major esophageal motility disturbances, that may be responsible for symptoms. HRM additionally provides insights into all relevant pathomechanisms of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD): It can reveal important information on the morphology and function of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ), the presence of a hiatus hernia, transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations, and dysmotility of the esophageal body. To obtain this information, a 3-step hierarchical system has been proposed for the algorithmic characterization of esophageal motor function. The first step is to investigate the morphology and contractility of the EGJ, the second to monitor esophageal body motor patterns in response to water swallows, and the third to determine the contraction reserve in patients with abnormal esophageal motor function using provocation tests. Observations made with HRM can not only explain the cause of symptoms in GERD patients but may also have the potential to direct specific treatment.","Keller, Jutta",Visceral medicine,368,16

BACKGROUND Working on the front lines of COVID-19 has brought unprecedented psychological stress on pre-examination and triage nurses. Nurse-patient communication ability and the level of self-efficacy are both significant for nurses' psychosomatic health and work input. However, limited empirical evidence exists regarding nurse-patient communication and self-efficacy and specific psychological intervention effects. DESIGN Cross-sectional research fulfilling the completed checklist of items that should be included in reports of cross-sectional studies (Supplementary File 1). METHODS Nurses (n=41) in the first layer of pre-examination and triage were engaged in a Balint group activity twice a week for two weeks. They were assessed with the General Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) pre- and postintervention, and a nurse-patient communication survey form was developed for further postintervention evaluation. The sample was recruited from a class A third -grade hospital in Sichuan, China. RESULTS Most of the subjects reported improvement in nurse-patient communication, increased cooperation between patients and their families, and a decreased missed examination rate after the intervention. Moreover, the total mean score of the GSES of nurses after the intervention was increased, but the difference was not statistically significant. The scores of all items in the GSES were improved, and the scores increase for item 4 (I am confident that I can effectively deal with any unexpected event) was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 pandemic, a short-term Balint group activity can improve the communication ability and self-efficacy level of front-line nurses to some extent. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE This information may provide some theoretical support for the development of early psychological interventions during major epidemic situations.","Yang, Chenghui; Zhou, Bo; Wang, Jinyu; Pan, Shuya",Journal of clinical nursing,368,13

Several innovations shifted the trajectory of improvement or resolved significant production limitations. Each is being integrated into practice, with the exception being gene editing technology, which is undergoing the federal approval process. Advances in molecular genomics have been applied to gene editing for control of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and to identify piglet genome contributions from each parent. Post-cervical artificial insemination technology is not novel, but this technology is now used extensively to accelerate the rate of genetic progress. A milestone was achieved with the discovery that dietary essential fatty acids, during lactation, were limiting reproduction. Their provision resulted in a dose-related response for pregnancy, pregnancy maintenance and litter size, especially in maturing sows and ultimately resolved seasonal infertility. The benefit of segregated early weaning (12 to 14 days of age) was realized for specific pathogen removal for genetic nucleus and multiplication. Application was premature for commercial practice, as piglet mortality and morbidity increased. Early weaning impairs intestinal barrier and mucosal innate immune development, which coincides with diminished resilience to pathogens and viability later in life. Two important milestones were achieved to improve precision nutrition for growing pigs. The first involved the updated publication of the National Research Council nutrient requirements for pigs, a collaboration between scientists from America and Canada. Precision nutrition advanced further when ingredient description, for metabolically available amino acids and net energy (by source plant), became a private sector nutrition product. The past decade also led to fortuitous discoveries of health-improving components in ingredients (xylanase, soybeans). Finally, two technologies converged to facilitate timely detection of multiple pathogens in a population: oral fluids sampling and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for pathogen analysis. Most critical diseases in North America are now routinely monitored by oral fluid sampling and prepared for analysis using PCR methods.","Boyd, R D; Zier-Rush, C E; Moeser, A J; Culbertson, M; Stewart, K R; Rosero, D S; Patience, J F",Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,368,28

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have been shown to improve the survival in metastatic NSCLC, but are far from being accepted as an induction therapy. METHODS We retrospectively collected data of all patients who received induction ICI (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) and chemotherapy (carboplatin with paclitaxel) for stage IIIA-B NSCLC followed by surgery in our unit between January 2019 and March 2020. RESULTS Of the 12 patients (9 males, 3 females) 6 had a squamous cell carcinoma, 3 had adenocarcinoma, 1 had an undifferentiated adenocarcinoma and 1 had adeno-squamous carcinoma. Seven patients had stage IIIA disease and 5 had stage IIIB. After induction therapy, 6 patients had stable disease and 6 had a partial response. The median tumor reduction was 3.05 cm (range 2.30-8.70). All patients, but one due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 outbreak, had no delay in surgery. Two patients experienced myelosuppression after induction therapy, two had minor adverse effects. Three patients had postoperative complications not related to the induction therapy. All patients had a pathological response: 5 complete, 4 major and 3 partial. Eleven patients are alive (mean months of follow-up 18.17±4.97) and free of disease.

Depending on channel-binding partners, polypeptides are moved by different mechanisms. In cotranslational translocation, the ribosome feeds the polypeptide chain directly into the channel. In posttranslational translocation, a ratcheting mechanism is used by the ER-lumenal chaperone BiP in eukaryotes, and a pushing mechanism is utilized by the SecA ATPase in bacteria. In prokaryotes, posttranslational translocation is facilitated through the function of the SecD/F protein.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the roles and molecular mechanisms of the lncRNA LOC440173 in ESCC progression. Microarray analysis and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were conducted to measure the expression levels of LOC440173 and miR-30d-5p. The biological function of this lncRNA was investigated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, clone formation, and transwell assays, as well as flow cytometry and Western blot analysis. The function of LOC440173 was validated in vivo using tumor xenografts. The regulatory network of LOC440173/miR-30d-5p/HDAC9 was established using bioinformatic analysis and verified with dual-luciferase reporter assays, RNA immunoprecipitation assay, and rescue experiments. The expression level of LOC440173 was significantly increased in ESCC tissues and esophageal carcinoma cells. High LOC440173 expression was correlated with histological grade, tumor invasion depth, lymph node metastasis, and TNM stage. Overexpression of LOC440173 promoted esophageal cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, as well as the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process in vitro, and facilitated tumor growth in vivo. MicroRNA-30d-5p (miR-30d-5p) was downregulated in ESCC tissues and acted as a direct binding target of LOC440173 during the regulation of HDAC9 expression in esophageal carcinoma cells. In conclusion, LOC440173 exerts a promotive role in ESCC tumorigenesis by targeting the miR-30d-5p/HDAC9 axis and regulating the EMT process. LOC440173 might be a new therapeutic target for the treatment of ESCC.","Wang, Gaoyan; Feng, Bo; Niu, Yunfeng; Wu, Jianhua; Yang, Yang; Shen, Supeng; Guo, Yanli; Liang, Jia; Guo, Wei; Dong, Zhiming",Molecular carcinogenesis,368,5

A Systematic Review and Meta- Analysis.,18.802351,9.475231,2020-07-21,"OBJECTIVE Identification of biological markers able to better stratify cardiovascular risks in SLE patients is needed. We aimed to determine whether serum cardiac troponin T (cTnT) levels measured with a highly sensitive assay [high sensitivity cTnT (HS-cTnT)] may predict cardiovascular events (CVEs) in SLE. METHOD All SLE patients included between 2007 and 2010 in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre PLUS trial were screened. Patients with no past history of CVE at inclusion and a follow-up period of >20 months were analysed. HS-cTnT concentration was measured using the electrochemiluminescence method on serum collected at PLUS inclusion. The primary outcome was the incident CVE. Factors associated with the primary outcome were identified and multivariate analysis was performed. RESULTS Overall, 442 SLE patients (of the 573 included in the PLUS study) were analysed for the primary outcome with a median follow up of 110 (interquartile range: 99-120) months. Among them, 29 (6.6%) experienced at least one CVE that occurred at a median of 67 (interquartile range: 31-91) months after inclusion. Six out of 29 patients had more than one CVE. In the multivariate analysis, dyslipidaemia, age and HS-cTnT were associated with the occurrence of CVE. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that a concentration of HS-cTnT > 4.27 ng/l at inclusion increased by 2.7 [hazard ratio 2.7 (95% CI: 1.3, 5.6), P =0.0083] the risk of CVE in SLE. CONCLUSION HS-cTnT measured in serum is the first identified biomarker independently associated with incident CVE in SLE patients.","Chezel, Julie; Costedoat-Chalumeau, Nathalie; Laouénan, Cedric; Rouzaud, Diane; Chenevier-Gobeaux, Camille; Le Guern, Véronique; Mathian, Alexis; Belhadi, Drifa; de Almeida Chaves, Sébastien; Duhaut, Pierre; Fain, Olivier; Galicier, Lionel; Ghillani-Dalbin, Pascale; Kahn, Jean Emmanuel; Morel, Nathalie; Perard, Laurent; Pha, Micheline; Saidoune, Fanny; Sarrot-Reynauld, Francoise; Aumaitre, Olivier; Chasset, François; Limal, Nicolas; Desmurs-Clavel, Helene; Ackermann, Felix; Amoura, Zahir; Papo, Thomas; Sacre, Karim",Rheumatology,368,29

Specific factors, such as hearing loss severity and location of residence, may disproportionately impact patients during the pandemic. The objective of this study was to assess the relative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on hearing loss patients, based on hearing device type and location of residence. STUDY DESIGN Prospective cross-sectional questionnaire study. SETTING Tertiary referral center. PATIENTS Adults with hearing loss. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Data included sociodemographic data, communication challenges, pandemic preparedness, access to healthcare, and mental and emotional health. RESULTS A total of 614 patients responded (27.8% response rate). Compared with hearing aid users, cochlear implant users reported more difficulty communicating with family/friends (53% versus 41%, p = 0.017), obtaining pandemic information (10% versus 3%, p = 0.002), and understanding live broadcasts (47% versus 17%, p = 0.001) during the pandemic. CI users were less likely than hearing aid users to seek general (52% versus 69%, p = 0.001) and hearing healthcare services (20% versus 34%, p = 0.002). Rural residents reported greater difficulty than urban residents communicating with friends/family (53% versus 39%, p = 0.001), obtaining food/supplies (41% versus 20%, p = 0.004), understanding live broadcasts (31% versus 20%, p = 0.001) during the pandemic.

AIM To assess the impact of enteral nutrition on the survival of alcoholic cirrhotic patients with jaundice but without acute alcoholic hepatitis. METHODS The study was a multicentre prospective randomised controlled trial comparing effects of enteral nutrition vs. a symptomatic support in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and jaundice (bilirubin ≥51 µmol/L) but without severe acute alcoholic hepatitis. A total of 99 patients were randomised to receive either the conventional symptomatic treatment (55 patients) or the symptomatic support associated with 35 kcal/Kg/day of enteral nutrition during 4 weeks followed by an oral nutritional support during 2 months (44 patients). Randomisation was stratified on nutritional status. One-year survival curves were compared using the Kaplan-Meier method and Logrank test. RESULTS Populations in both arms were similar. One-year survival was similar in the overall population (27/44 patients (61.4%) in the enteral nutrition arm vs. 36/55 (65.5%) in the control arm; Logrank P = 0.60) and in the subgroup suffering from malnutrition [18/29 patients (62.1%) in the enteral nutrition arm vs. 20/32 (62.5%) in the control arm; Logrank P = 0.99]. There was no statistical difference for bilirubin, prothrombin rate, Child-Pugh score, albumin or nutritional assessment. Complications during treatment (bleeding, encephalopathy, infection) occurred in 23% of patients in the enteral nutrition group (10/44) vs. 16% (9/55) of the control patients (P = 0.59).

We researched the roles and possible mechanism of miR-155-5p in renal interstitial fibrosis, which may provide a potential endogenous target for renal interstitial fibrosis in obstructive nephropathy. Herein, NRK-49F cells were transfected with miR-155-5p mimic, miR-155-5p inhibitor, SIRT1 plasmid and/or SIRT1 siRNA. The unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) model was built with male C57 black mice and administrated with SRT1720 by tail vein injection. Levels of miR-155-5p, SIRT1 and relative proteins (TGF-β1, α-SMA, Collage I and fibronectin) in NRK-49F cells or mice kidney tissues were measured with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or Western blot. The target gene of miR-155-5p was analyzed through TargetScan and dual-luciferase reporter assay. Mice kidney tissue was stained with Masson trichrome. It was found that miR-155-5p overexpression promoted the expressions of fibroblast related proteins expression and inhibited the SIRT1 expression in NRK-49F cells, while miR-155-5p silencing had an opposite effect. SIRT1 can bind with miR-155-5p. MiR-155-5p inhibited the level of SIRT1. Fibroblast related proteins were up-regulated by miR-155-5p and down-regulated by SIRT1 in NRK-49F cells, while the up-regulatory effect of miR-155-5p was reversed by SIRT1. MiR-155-5p expression was up-regulated and SIRT1 expression was down-regulated in the kidney tissue of UUO mice. SRT1720 attenuated the fiber deposition, up-regulated SIRT1 level and down-regulated the levels of fibroblast related proteins in UUO model mice. To conclude, miR-155-5p promotes renal interstitial fibrosis in obstructive nephropathy via inhibiting SIRT1 signaling pathway.","Wang, Zhan; Chen, Rui; Xu, Zheming; Ru, Wei; Tian, Hongjuan; Yang, Fan; Tao, Chang",Journal of receptor and signal transduction research,368,29

The aim of this trial was to compare postoperative pain within the first 3 months and 1 year after surgery in patients undergoing open mesh inguinal hernia repair using either a self-gripping lightweight polyester mesh or a polypropylene lightweight mesh fixed with sutures. METHODS Adult men undergoing Lichtenstein repair for primary inguinal hernia were randomized to ProGrip™ self-gripping mesh or standard sutured lightweight polypropylene mesh. RESULTS In total 557 men were included in the final analysis (self-gripping mesh 270, sutured mesh 287). Early postoperative pain scores were lower with self-gripping mesh than with sutured lightweight mesh: mean visual analogue pain score relative to baseline +1·3 and +8·6 respectively at discharge (P = 0·033), and mean surgical pain scale score relative to baseline +4·2 and +9·7 respectively on day 7 (P = 0·027). There was no significant difference in mid-term (1 month) and long-term (3 months and 1 year) pain scores between the groups. Surgery was significantly quicker with self-gripping mesh (mean difference 7·6 min; P < 0·001). There were no significant differences in reported mesh handling, analgesic consumption, other wound complications, patient satisfaction or hernia recurrence between the groups. CONCLUSION Self-gripping mesh for open inguinal hernia repair was well tolerated and reduced early postoperative pain (within the first week), without increasing the risk of early recurrence. It did not reduce chronic pain.

Lung macrophages are important in mounting an inflammatory response to injury, but they are also involved in repair of injury. Macrophages develop mixed phenotypes in complex pathological conditions and polarize to a predominant phenotype depending on the duration and stage of injury and/or repair. Little is known about the reprogramming required for lung macrophages to switch between these divergent functions; therefore, understanding the mechanism(s) by which macrophages promote metabolic reprogramming to regulate lung injury is essential. Here, we show that lung macrophages polarize to a pro-inflammatory, classically activated phenotype after cadmium-mediated lung injury. Since metabolic adaptation provides energy for the diverse macrophage functions, these classically activated macrophages show metabolic reprogramming to glycolysis. RNA sequencing revealed upregulation of glycolytic enzymes and transcription factors regulating glycolytic flux in lung macrophages from cadmium-exposed mice. Moreover, cadmium exposure promoted increased macrophage glycolytic function with enhanced extracellular acidification rate (ECAR), glycolytic metabolites, and lactate excretion. These observations suggest that cadmium mediates the persistence of classically activated lung macrophages to exacerbate lung injury.","Larson-Casey, Jennifer L; Gu, Linlin; Fiehn, Oliver; Carter, A Brent",The Journal of biological chemistry,368,1

This protocol outlines an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational cohort studies to explore the overall effect of delayed prescribing and identify key patient characteristics that are associated with efficacy of delayed prescribing. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A systematic search of the databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, EBSCO CINAHL Plus and Web of Science was conducted to identify relevant studies from inception to October 2017. Outcomes of interest include duration of illness, severity of illness, complication, reconsultation and patient satisfaction. Study authors of eligible papers will be contacted and invited to contribute raw IPD data. IPD data will be checked against published data, harmonised and aggregated to create one large IPD database. Multilevel regression will be performed to explore interaction effects between treatment allocation and patient characteristics. The economic evaluation will be conducted based on IPD from the combined trial and observational studies to estimate the differences in costs and effectiveness for delayed prescribing compared with normal practice. A decision model will be developed to assess potential savings and cost-effectiveness in terms of reduced antibiotic usage of delayed prescribing and quality-adjusted life years. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Southampton Faculty of Medicine Research Ethics Committee (Reference number: 30068). Findings of this study will be published in peer-reviewed academic journals as well as General Practice trade journals and will be presented at national and international conferences.

Primary outcomes include incidence proportions of local control, enucleation, metastatic progression, disease-specific, and overall mortality. Treatment-related toxicities such as incidence proportions of radiation retinopathy, neovascular glaucoma, optic neuropathy, and cataract formation were examined as secondary outcomes. Five-year survival and 5-year local control rates were also assessed. MATERIALS AND METHODS PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and 2 Cochrane databases were searched up to December 31, 2018. Random effects models were used to calculate pooled incidence proportions of outcome measures. Meta-regression was carried out to explore the potential impact of dose per fraction on local control. RESULTS Twenty-four articles with a total of 1745 patients were included in the meta-analysis. There were no statistically significant differences between photon-based fSRT and SRS for all primary, secondary and 5-year outcome measures, including local control (P=0.28), enucleation (P=0.51), and neovascular glaucoma (P=0.40). The 5-year local control rate was 90% (95% confidence interval: 76%, 96%) for fSRT and 89% (70%, 97%) for SRS. CONCLUSIONS Our meta-analysis showed no difference in tumor control, survival and toxicities, as defined in this paper, between SRS and fSRT for uveal melanoma. Confounding biases remain an expected limitation in this study of novel treatment modalities deployed in rare tumors.

A series of prominent scandals involving harmful medical devices has made improving the regulation of these devices an urgent problem for the European Union (EU). This is, however, a specific example of a general phenomenon. The EU remains first and foremost a large and integrated market within which the EU institutions have considerable regulatory authority. Even if there is little EU commitment to a health or social policy agenda, its use of that regulatory authority shapes health care cost and quality and should be understood as health policy. We use data from EU-level and national policy documents to analyse the EU's current regulatory framework for medical devices and assess its likely future efficacy. Despite revising the medical devices directive to require more stringent pre-authorization requirements for high-risk medical devices and improvements in post-market surveillance, the key underlying problems of market fragmentation and patient safety persist.

They are often caused by poor wound healing. We present the case of a complex giant incisional hernia that was repaired by implanting an intraperitoneal mesh. Case presentation A 63-year-old man with obesity, hypertension, and multiple previous laparotomies, who developed a complex giant incisional hernia (xipho-pubic > 10 cm wide). An open technique repair was decided with the introduction of a large mesh (Parietex ™ Composite) in an intraperitoneal position, covering a 25 × 16 cm hernial ring. After two years, the patient continues to be followed due to a low-output distal enterocutaneous fistula. Clinical discussion Currently, there is no technique or approach that has become a gold standard for ventral incisional hernia repair. The introduction of an intraperitoneal mesh with two surfaces by laparotomy is recommended when there are contraindications for laparoscopic surgery, for example in obese patients, and patients with multiple previous laparotomies. However, it has been reported to be a complex technique with an enterocutaneous fistula rate of 0.3-4%. Conclusion The introduction of a composite mesh represents an alternative surgical technique for the repair of giant incisional hernias.","Palacios Huatuco, René M; Pinsak, Agustín E; Palencia, Rafael",Annals of medicine and surgery,368,1

It can occur as an idiopathic disorder at birth or as part of a variety of cardiovascular and pulmonary disorders. Inhaled pulmonary vasodilators (IPV) can reduce pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and improve RV function with minimal systemic effects. IPV includes inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), inhaled aerosolized prostacyclin, or analogs, including epoprostenol, iloprost, treprostinil, and other vasodilators. In addition to pulmonary vasodilating effects, IPV can also be used to improve oxygenation, reduce inflammation, and protect cell. Off-label use of IPV is common in daily clinical practice. However, evidence supporting the inhalational administration of these medications is limited, inconclusive, and controversial regarding their safety and efficacy. We conducted a search for relevant papers published up to May 2020 in four databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE and Web of Science. This review demonstrates that the clinical using and updated evidence of IPV. iNO is widely used in neonates, pediatrics, and adults with different cardiopulmonary diseases. The limitations of iNO include high cost, flat dose-response, risk of significant rebound PH after withdrawal, and the requirement of complex technology for monitoring. The literature suggests that inhaled aerosolized epoprostenol, iloprost, treprostinil and others such as milrinone and levosimendan may be similar to iNO. More research of IPV is needed to determine acceptable inclusion criteria, long-term outcomes, and management strategies including time, dose, and duration.","Liu, Kai; Wang, Huan; Yu, Shen-Ji; Tu, Guo-Wei; Luo, Zhe",Annals of translational medicine,368,11

Group differences in COVID-19 impact on families were also examined based on race and ethnicity, being medically and/or geographically underserved, and insurance status. METHODS Participants (n = 131) included children with epilepsy and their families from two clinical trials. The Impact of COVID-19 on Pediatric Epilepsy Management (ICPEM) measure was developed and administered to caregivers online from April 2020 to September 2020 across four large pediatric hospitals. Administration of the ICPEM occurred both during routine study assessments and an additional acute time point to obtain information early in the pandemic (e.g., April and May 2020). Descriptive statistics and t-tests were used for analyses. RESULTS Data indicate minor to moderate impact of COVID-19 on pediatric epilepsy management. Caregivers of children with epilepsy reported the most impact on education and social functioning. Adherence to CDC guidelines was reported to be high. Those having public insurance reported greater difficulties obtaining daily anti-seizure medications compared to those with private insurance. CONCLUSIONS This study presents important initial data regarding the impact of COVID-19 epilepsy management and daily functioning in children with epilepsy and their families. While the acute impact of COVID-19 restrictions appear to be mild to moderate, it is unclear what the long-term impact of the pandemic will be on families of children with epilepsy.","Modi, Avani C; Patel, Anup D; Stevens, Jack; Smith, Gigi; Huszti, Heather; Guilfoyle, Shanna M; Mara, Constance A; Schmidt, Matthew; Wagner, Janelle L",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,368,20

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of a new tailored dosing (TD) regimen compared with the approved PICOPREP day-before dosing regimen (DBD) in the European Union. Patient and methods Patients (≥ 18 years) undergoing colonoscopy were randomised (2:1) to TD (Dose 1, 10 - 18 hours; Dose 2, 4 - 6 hours before colonoscopy) or DBD (Dose 1 before 8:00AM on the day before colonoscopy; Dose 2, 6 - 8 hours after Dose 1). The primary endpoint of overall colon cleansing efficacy was based on total Ottawa Scale (OS) scores (0 - 14, excellent-worst). The key secondary endpoint was a binary endpoint based on the ascending colon OS (success 0 or 1, failure [≥ 2]). Convenience and satisfaction were evaluated similar to the primary and key secondary endpoints. Safety and tolerability were also evaluated. Results Use of the PICOPREP TD regimen resulted in a statistically significant reduction in the mean total Ottawa Scale score compared to the PICOPREP DBD regimen (-3.93, 95 % confidence intervals [CI]: - 4.99, - 2.97; P < 0.0001) in the intent-to-treat analysis set. The PICOPREP TD regimen also resulted in a statistically significant increase in the odds of achieving an ascending colon OS score ≤ 1, compared to the PICOPREP DBD regimen (estimated odds ratio 9.18, 95 % CI: 4.36, 19.32; P < 0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference in the overall rate of treatment-emergent adverse events (12 % (TD) and 5.7 % (DBD), respectively, P = 0.2988). The convenience and satisfaction were comparable in the two groups. Conclusion The TD regimen was superior to the DBD regimen for overall and ascending colon cleansing efficacy.

The study was focused on changes in two types of motivation: autonomous motivation- finding importance in the task of staying at home, and controlled motivation- staying at home because of felt pressure or choicelessness, as autonomous motivation predicts effective behavior change better than controlled motivation, especially long-term. Predictions grounded in self-determination theory (SDT) tested whether three motivating aspects of messages to stay at home from governmental and public health agencies, physicians, the news, and family and friends predicted changes in these motivations across time. Perceiving messages to stay at home as controlling predicted increases in controlled motivation and decreases in autonomous motivation over two months. Conversely, perceiving messages to stay at home as autonomy supportive predicted increases in autonomous motivation over two months. Results for mandated orders to stay at home were intriguing: they related to increases in both controlled and autonomous motivations over time. Exploratory analyses revealed that increases in autonomous motivation over time predicted actual time spent at home reported at Wave 2, whereas increases in controlled motivation did not relate.

A systematic review and meta-analysis.,19.293732,9.416064,2019-12-17,"Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the gold standard for gallbladder removal and the most common laparoscopic procedure worldwide. With the advent of laparoscopic surgery and its continuous development, the focus has shifted to 'scarless' surgery. In recent times, the innovative technique of single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) has been applied in gallbladder removal and even more complex biliopancreatic procedures to further minimize the invasiveness of the surgery. Newer developments in laparoscopic equipments and instrumentation have helped to further evolve this field of minimally invasive surgery. Literature search was performed using the following online search engines: Google, Medline, PubMed, Cochrane, and the online Springer link library. The terms used for the search were as follows: SILS, LESS, single-incision laparoscopic surgery, single-port laparoscopic surgery, SILS cholecystectomy, and SILS pancreatic surgery. Articles that matched the search criteria were selected and extensively reviewed. Moreover, pertinent information on instrumentation and technology for SILS and LESS was obtained by accessing websites of manufacturers. Although SILS represents the search for an essentially scarless surgery, there is still not a widespread use and uniformity of this procedure. SILS is performed either by single- or multiple-port technique. In the present article, we present a review of the potential benefits, limitations, and risks of SILS in biliary and pancreatic diseases. There are many studies showing benefits in cholecystectomy. A few case reports have also emerged about its feasibility in procedures such as cystogastrostomy and limited pancreatic resection. Further research and development of this technique is needed to arrive at a tangible conclusion about the perceived benefits of SILS. Randomized studies to compare SILS with traditional laparoscopy are essential.","Sharma, A; Dahiya, P; Khullar, R; Soni, V; Baijal, M; Chowbey, P K",The Indian journal of surgery,368,19

Quantitative analysis (at least 2-fold quantitative alteration, p < 0.05) revealed 127 differentially expressed proteins with 68 up-regulated proteins and 59 down-regulated proteins of which 93 were successfully identified. The implication for mammalian cellular responses to this neurotropic flavivirus infection was analyzed and made possible more comprehensive characterization of the virus-host interactions involved in pathogenesis.

We hypothesized that the outcome of AED treatment can be predicted from EEG data in patients with TLE. METHODS Twenty-three patients with TLE and twenty-five healthy controls were examined. Clinical outcome was dichotomized into seizure-free (SF) and non-seizure-free (NSF) after two years of LEV. EEG parameters were compared between healthy controls and patients with TLE at baseline (EEGpre) and after three months of AED therapy (EEGpre-post) and between SF and NSF patients. Receiver Operating Characteristic curves models were built to test whether EEG parameters predicted outcome. RESULTS AED therapy induces an increase in EEG power for Alpha (p = 0.06) and a decrease in Theta (p < 0.05). Connectivity values were lower in SF compared to NSF patients (p < 0.001). Quantitative EEG predicted outcome after LEV treatment with an estimated accuracy varying from 65.2% to 91.3% (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.56-0.93) for EEGpre and from 69.9% to 86.9% (AUC = 0.69-0.94) for EEGpre-post. CONCLUSIONS AED therapy induces EEG modifications in TLE patients, and such modifications are predictive of clinical outcome. SIGNIFICANCE Quantitative EEG may help understanding the effect of AEDs in the central nervous system and offer new prognostic biomarkers for patients with epilepsy.","Ricci, Lorenzo; Assenza, Giovanni; Pulitano, Patrizia; Simonelli, Valerio; Vollero, Luca; Lanzone, Jacopo; Mecarelli, Oriano; Di Lazzaro, Vincenzo; Tombini, Mario",Clinical neurophysiology : official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology,368,17

There is a lack of epidemiological data about these pathogens in Morocco. Hence the aim of this study, which is the determination of their prevalence in some leafy greens and root vegetables sold in Marrakech. Methods A total of 132 vegetable samples including carrot, coriander, lettuce, parsley and radish were purchased monthly from three different markets in Marrakech from March 2017 to January 2018, pre-treated and subjected to microscopic and molecular analyses. Results Of the 132 samples of vegetables analyzed by qPCR, the overall rate of protozoan was 21.21% (28/132); 22 samples were found to be contaminated with T. gondii, 6 with G. duodenalis, and none was positive for C. parvum/hominis. Whereas, modified Ziehl-Neelsen staining allowed the detection of Cryptosporidium spp. in 3% (4/132) of examined samples.

From the early 1990s, a severe alder (Alnus spp.) decline due to an unknown Phytophthora species was observed in several European countries. Genetic analyses revealed that the disease was caused by the triploid hybrid P. x alni, which originated in Europe from the hybridization of P. uniformis and P. x multiformis. Here, we investigated the population structure of P. x alni (158 isolates) and P. uniformis (85 isolates) in several European countries using microsatellite markers. Our analyses confirmed the genetic structure previously observed in other European populations, with P. uniformis populations consisting of at most two multilocus genotypes (MLGs) and P. x alni populations dominated by MLG Pxa-1. The genetic structure of P. x alni populations in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Sweden seemed to reflect the physical isolation of river systems. Most rare P. x alni MLGs showed a loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at one or a few microsatellite loci compared with other MLGs. This LOH may allow a stabilization within the P. x alni genome or a rapid adaptation to stress situations. Alternatively, alleles may be lost because of random genetic drift in small, isolated populations, with no effect on fitness of P. x alni. Additional studies would be necessary to confirm these patterns of population diversification and to better understand the factors driving it.","Mizeriene, Goda; Cerny, Karel; Zyka, Vladimir; Bakonyi, József; Nagy, Zoltán Á; Oliva, Jonas; Redondo, Miguel Angel; Corcobado, Tamara; Martín-García, Jorge; Prospero, Simone",Phytopathology,368,1

Acute or subacute infarction was seen in 39 (6%), intraparenchymal hemorrhage in 14 (2%), corpus callosum involvement in 7, and thalamus in 5 patients. In spine and neck studies, lung opacities and adenopathy were seen in 46 and 4 patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Infarction followed by intraparenchymal hemorrhage was the most common acute findings in the brain with frequent involvement of the corpus callosum and thalami. In the neck, lung abnormalities were frequently present, and adenopathy was almost always associated with a second pathology.","Kelsch, Ryan D; Silbergleit, Richard; Krishnan, Anant",Journal of computer assisted tomography,368,31

An alternative approach to the pathogen-detection strategy is based on a comprehensive analysis of the host response to the infection. This review focuses on the value of transcriptome analyses of blood leukocytes for the diagnosis and management of patients with infectious diseases. RECENT FINDINGS Initial studies showed that RNA from blood leukocytes of children with acute viral and bacterial infections carried pathogen-specific transcriptional signatures. Subsequently, transcriptional signatures for several other infections have been described and validated in humans with malaria, dengue, salmonella, melioidosis, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, tuberculosis, and HIV. In addition, transcriptome analyses represent an invaluable tool to understand disease pathogenesis and to objectively classify patients according to the clinical severity. SUMMARY Microarray studies have been shown to be highly reproducible using different platforms, and in different patient populations, confirming the value of blood transcriptome analyses to study pathogen-specific host immune responses in the clinical setting. Combining the detection of the pathogen with a comprehensive assessment of the host immune response will provide a new understanding of the correlations between specific causative agents, the host response, and the clinical manifestations of the disease.","Mejias, Asuncion; Suarez, Nicolas M; Ramilo, Octavio",Current opinion in infectious diseases,368,31

Our objective was to describe the relationship between autoregulation and neurologic injury in HIE. METHODS Neonates with HIE had autoregulation monitoring with the hemoglobin volume index (HVx) during therapeutic hypothermia, rewarming, and the first 6 h of normothermia. The 5-mm Hg range of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) with best vasoreactivity (MAPOPT) was identified. The percentage of time spent with MAP below MAPOPT and deviation in MAP from MAPOPT were measured. Neonates received brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 3-7 d after treatment. MRIs were coded as no, mild, or moderate/severe injury in five regions. RESULTS HVx identified MAPOPT in 79% (19/24), 77% (17/22), and 86% (18/21) of the neonates during hypothermia, rewarming, and normothermia, respectively. Neonates with moderate/severe injury in paracentral gyri, white matter, basal ganglia, and thalamus spent a greater proportion of time with MAP below MAPOPT during rewarming than neonates with no or mild injury. Neonates with moderate/severe injury in paracentral gyri, basal ganglia, and thalamus had greater MAP deviation below MAPOPT during rewarming than neonates without injury. CONCLUSION Maintaining MAP within or above MAPOPT may reduce the risk of neurologic injuries in neonatal HIE.","Howlett, Jessica A; Northington, Frances J; Gilmore, Maureen M; Tekes, Aylin; Huisman, Thierry A G M; Parkinson, Charlamaine; Chung, Shang-En; Jennings, Jacky M; Jamrogowicz, Jessica J; Larson, Abby C; Lehmann, Christoph U; Jackson, Eric; Brady, Ken M; Koehler, Raymond C; Lee, Jennifer K",Pediatric research,368,19

Sofía is a Mexican health care and technology startup that implemented an app-based telemedicine program during this pandemic in Mexico. Materials and Methods: The telemedicine program included on-demand video consultations with internal medicine specialists from March to September 2020. In the following study, we present a descriptive analysis of all the patients in the telemedicine program, called Coronaid. Results: 2,585 video consultations were conducted for a total of 1,545 patients and 44.4% of these were associated with respiratory symptoms. Of all patients, 46% were female and the mean age was 34 years, 52.2% were overweight or obese, and 25% presented at least one comorbid condition. Aside from respiratory complaints, the most common chief complaints were associated with gastrointestinal, psychiatric, and genitourinary symptoms. Patient satisfaction after video consultation services was >80%. Discussion: During the COVID-19 pandemic, an application-based telemedicine program had a high patient satisfaction rate in a significant sample of young patients, which can be attributed to the accessibility of the medical services and widespread use of smartphones in this patient demographic. Conclusion: Telemedicine has proven to be a useful, safe, and effective tool to improve patients' health, which has been boosted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of mobile applications and video consultation services can encourage patients to improve their health and prevent complications in the short and long terms.","Morgenstern-Kaplan, Dan; Rocha-Haro, Andrea; Canales-Albarrán, Sofía Jimena; Núñez-García, Edgar; León-Mayorga, Yasshid",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,368,1

We studied the relative cost-effective initial diagnostic strategy for a 1.5- to 2-cm nodule suggestive of cancer. METHODS A decision analysis model was developed to assess the costs and outcomes of four initial diagnostic strategies for diagnosis of a 1.5- to 2-cm nodule with either a 50% or 65% pretest probability of cancer. Medicare reimbursement rates were used for costs. Quality-adjusted life years were estimated using patient survival based on pathologic staging and utilities derived from the literature. RESULTS When cancer prevalence was 65%, tissue acquisition strategies of NB and CT-FNA had higher quality-adjusted life years compared with either FDG-PET or VATS, and VATS was the most costly strategy. In sensitivity analyses, NB and CT-FNA were more cost-effective than FDG-PET when FDG-PET specificity was less than 72%. When cancer prevalence was 50%, NB, CT-FNA, and FDG-PET had similar cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS Both NB and CT-FNA diagnostic strategies are more cost-effective than either VATS biopsy or FDG-PET scan to diagnose lung cancer in moderate- to high-risk nodules and resulted in fewer nontherapeutic operations when FDG-PET specificity was less than 72%. An FDG-PET scan for diagnosis of lung cancer may not be cost-effective in regions of the country where specificity is low.","Deppen, Stephen A; Davis, William T; Green, Elizabeth A; Rickman, Otis; Aldrich, Melinda C; Fletcher, Sarah; Putnam, Joseph B; Grogan, Eric L",The Annals of thoracic surgery,368,1

Following ward restructuring at our tertiary paediatric centre in preparation for the COVID-19 pandemic, a new dedicated General Paediatrics ward was established. We evaluated medical and nursing staff well-being, morale and perceived impacts on care after the ward's establishment. METHODS Experiences were sought from medical and nursing staff whom had worked across both previous wards caring for General Paediatrics patients, as well as the new dedicated General Paediatrics ward. Mandated responses used the format of much better, better, same, worse and much worse. RESULTS A total of 73/82 (89%) medical and nursing staff completed the survey. A greater than 90% improved or neutral response was noted for 31/35 (89%) questions. About 80% of staff reported the new dedicated General Paediatrics ward provided a better or much better team-based approach, time efficient approach and overall model of care. A much better or better response was reported for communication between medical and nursing staff in 68%, team comradery in 69%, supportive/helpful nursing staff in 74%, job stress level in 66% and staff morale in 60% of respondents.

Understanding the reliability of self-reported smell loss in ambulatory cases can assess the utility of this screening measure. METHODS A prospective, longitudinal study evaluating patient-reported and measured olfactory function using the validated 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT) was conducted on adult outpatients with COVID-19. Patient-reported olfaction scores using a visual analog scale (VAS) were obtained at baseline, time of COVID-19 testing, and time of BSIT completion. Linear associations between VAS and BSIT were evaluated using Spearman's correlation coefficient and the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of VAS scores were calculated. Logistic regression identified characteristics associated with accurate assessment of olfactory function. RESULTS A total of 81 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 positive subjects, of whom 54 self-reported smell loss, were prospectively recruited ≤5 days from diagnosis date between May 8, 2020, and July 8, 2020. Self-reported smell loss had good discriminative ability in identifying abnormal BSIT (area under receiver operating curve [AUC] 0.82, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.71 to 0.92). A VAS <5 demonstrated sensitivity of 0.62 and specificity of 0.94 for predicting hyposmia (BSIT ≤8) with accuracy of 82.7%, whereas a VAS <9 had highest sensitivity at 0.86. Moderate bivariate linear associations were found between VAS and BSIT scores (rs = 0.59, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION Self-reported olfactory loss associated with COVID-19 has a strong ability to predict abnormal olfactory function though the 2 measures are moderately correlated. Subjective olfactory assessment is useful in screening olfactory dysfunction at early disease time points when psychophysical testing cannot be conducted.","Prajapati, Divya P; Shahrvini, Bita; MacDonald, Bridget V; Crawford, Kayva L; Lechner, Matt; DeConde, Adam S; Yan, Carol H",International forum of allergy & rhinology,368,1

However, accumulating evidence indicates that the ArkDPI vaccine is ineffective when applied by hatchery spray cabinet using the same manufacturer-recommended dose per bird. For this study, we aimed to determine the minimum infectious dose for the spray-administered ArkDPI vaccine, which we designate as the dose that achieves the same level of infection and replication as the eye drop-administered ArkDPI vaccine. To this end, we used increasing doses of commercial ArkDPI vaccine to vaccinate 100 commercial broiler chicks at day of hatch, using a commercial hatchery spray cabinet. The choanal cleft of each bird was swabbed at 7 and 10 days postvaccination, and real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR was performed. We observed that the level of infection and replication with spray vaccination matches with that of eye drop vaccination when chicks received 100 times the standard dose for the commercial ArkDPI vaccine. We further examined the S1 spike gene sequence from a subset of reisolated ArkDPI vaccine virus samples and observed that certain nucleotide changes arise in vaccine viruses reisolated from chicks, as previously reported. This suggests that the ArkDPI vaccine has a certain virus subpopulation that, while successful at infecting and replicating in chicks, represents only a minor virus subpopulation in the original vaccine. Thus, the minimum infectious dose for the ArkDPI vaccine using a hatchery spray cabinet appears to be dependent on the amount of this minor subpopulation reaching the chicks.","Leyson, Christina M; Hilt, Deborah A; Jordan, Brian J; Jackwood, Mark W",Avian diseases,368,1

METHODS A survey was sent to MFM fellowship program directors for distribution to current MFM fellows across U.S. Geographic regions, as determined using Census Bureau-designated regions. The survey looked at comfort and experience with FAVDs and vacuum-assisted vaginal deliveries (VAVD) throughout their post-graduate training. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze survey responses. Respondents were compared by post-graduate year (PGY) and region. RESULTS One hundred six MFM fellows (32%) completed the survey. 22.6% of MFM fellows had performed greater than 30 FAVDs, with 33% having performed ≤10 FAVDs. In comparison, 35.8% of fellows had performed more than 30 VAVDs. While 95.2% of fellows feel prepared to perform a VAVD independently, only 59.4% feel prepared to do FAVDs independently. Never the less, 53% of MFM fellows favor performing a FAVD. While some regional differences were seen, there was no significant difference in the percent of fellows by geographic region who have performed >30 FAVD (p = .87). MFM fellows in the West are most likely to have performed >30 FAVD at 57.8%, compared to 42.3, 35, and 11.4% in the Midwest, South, and Northeast, respectively. CONCLUSION MFM fellows are more confident with VAVD compared to FAVD. Despite feeling less confident performing FAVD (versus VAVD), the majority of MFM fellows feel comfortable performing FAVDs independently. Region of training fellowship training does not significantly affect one's confidence in FAVDs. A coordinated nationwide effort to increase exposure to and confidence for FAVDs should be considered.","Rose, Kelsey; Mei, Jenny; Kwan, Lorna; Pluym, Ilina D; Han, Christina S; Afshar, Yalda","The journal of maternal-fetal & neonatal medicine : the official journal of the European Association of Perinatal Medicine, the Federation of Asia and Oceania Perinatal Societies, the International Society of Perinatal Obstetricians",368,1

This study used the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) model to examine (a) whether workplace accommodations enable workers, particularly those with different impairments, to remain economically active; and (b) the predictors of the onset of work accommodations. Data from two waves of a large-scale longitudinal survey of disability in Great Britain, the Life Opportunities Survey (2009-2012) were analysed. 2307 workers with an impairment and 4308 workers without an impairment were followed up for a year. Work accommodations appear to enable workers with impairments to remain economically active, especially those with mental impairments. There was no difference in the employment rates of workers with and without mental impairments who had two or more work accommodations, in contrast to the 10% employment gap between workers with and without mental impairments who did not have any work accommodations. While there was no gender difference in the disability employment gap, barriers to employment related to caregiving were much greater for women compared to men. Moreover, only workers with incident pain impairments were associated with an increase in their work accommodations, not workers with incident mental impairments. Despite the evidence that workers with mental impairments could benefit considerably from workplace accommodations, they are less likely to have their workplace adjusted. The ICF model is particularly useful in analysing the role of work accommodations because it considers a much wider range of factors that are relevant not just to workers with different types of impairments, but are also relevant to the wider group of workers who use workplace accommodations.","Chandola, Tarani; Rouxel, Patrick",Social science & medicine,368,31

A century of information on BCG, and three decades of experience with rBCG, has generated solid knowledge in this field. AREA COVERED Here, we review the current state of knowledge of BCG and rBCG development. Molecular tools have facilitated the expression of a variety of molecules in BCG, with the aim of improving its efficacy as a tuberculosis vaccine, generating polyvalent vaccines against other pathogens, including viruses, bacteria, and parasites, and developing immunotherapy approaches against non-invasive bladder cancer. BCG's recently appraised heterologous effects and prospects for expanding its application to other diseases are also addressed. EXPERT OPINION There are high expectations for new tuberculosis vaccines currently undergoing advanced clinical trials, which could change the prospects of the field. Systems biology could reveal effective biomarkers of protection, which would greatly support vaccine development. The development of appropriate large-scale production processes would further support implementation of new vaccines and rBCG products. The next few years should consolidate the broader applications of BCG and produce insights into improvements using the recombinant BCG technology.","Marques-Neto, Lazaro M; Piwowarska, Zuzanna; Kanno, Alex I; Moraes, Luana; Trentini, Monalisa M; Rodriguez, Dunia; Silva, JoseLSC; Leite, LucianaCC",Expert review of vaccines,368,28

The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiological results after laparoscopic surgery in patients with symptomatic rectocele and III/IV stage vaginal vault prolapse METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study of women with symptomatic rectoceles and middle compartment prolapse operated on between 2013 and 2015, who underwent a laparoscopic sacrocolpoperineopexy with synthetic Y mesh attached to puborectalis muscles, the anterior and posterior vagina wall and the sacrum. The clinical outcomes measured were symptoms of prolapse, obstructive defecation syndrome and quality of life. Radiological outcomes were distance of the vaginal vault below pubococcigeal line and depth of rectovaginal wall protrusion in dynamic pelvic resonance. RESULTS 33 patients were included. 32 of them remained asymptomatic after a three years follow-up. Significant differences were shown in the obstructed defecation score and quality of life after 6, 12 and 36 months compared to preoperatively. No differences were identified when the postoperative results were compared. Significant differences were shown in preoperative vaginal vault prolapse (3.2 cms ± 0.8 SD below the pubococcigeal Line) and rectocele size, compared with 1 and 3 years after surgery. There were no significant differences in vaginal vault prolapse when compared after 1 and 3 years. When rectocele size after 1 and 3 years was compared, significant differences were shown, but only one clinical recurrence (3%) was identified after a mean follow-up of 47 months. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic sacrocolpoperineopexy in patients with symptomatic rectocele and III/IV vaginal vault prolapse solves the constipation and obstructed defecation with an excellent quality of life and low clinical recurrences.

With the investigation of the gut-lung axis, more studies have demonstrated the important role of gut microbiota in lung inflammation. The precise role of the gut microbiota in chickens-associated colibacillosis, however, is unknown. Thus, this study assessed the function of the gut microbiota in the chicken defense against APEC infection. Chicken gut microbiota was depleted by drinking water with a mixture of antibiotics (Abx), and subsequently, a model of colibacillosis was established by the intranasal perfusion of APEC. The results showed that gut microbiota protects the chicken challenge by APEC from aggravated lung histopathologic injury, up-regulated pro-inflammatory cytokine production, and increased bacterial load in lung tissues compared with controls. In addition, the air-blood barrier permeability was significantly increased in gut microbiota-depleted chickens compared to the control chickens after challenge with APEC. Furthermore, feeding acetate significantly inhibited the lung inflammatory response and the reduced air-blood permeability induced by APEC infection. The expression of free fatty acid receptor 2 (FFAR2), a receptor for acetate, was also increased in the lung after treatment with acetate. In conclusion, depletion of the gut microbiota resulted in increased susceptibility of chickens to APEC challenge, and gut microbiota derived acetate acted as a protective mediator during the APEC challenge. Novel therapeutic targets that focus on the gut microbiota may be effective in controlling colibacillosis in poultry.","Peng, Lu-Yuan; Shi, Hai-Tao; Gong, Zi-Xuan; Yi, Peng-Fei; Tang, Bo; Shen, Hai-Qing; Fu, Ben-Dong",Veterinary microbiology,368,31

In response, states have passed regulations for office-based surgeries, private organizations have established standards for facility accreditation, and professional associations have developed clinical guidelines. While abortions have been performed in office setting for decades, states have also enacted laws requiring that facilities that perform abortions meet specific requirements. The extent to which facility requirements have an impact on patient outcomes-for any procedure-is unclear. METHODS AND FINDINGS We conducted a systematic review to examine the effect of outpatient facility type (ASC vs. office) and specific facility characteristics (e.g., facility accreditation, emergency response protocols, clinician qualifications, physical plant characteristics, other policies) on patient safety, patient experience and service availability in non-hospital-affiliated outpatient settings. To identify relevant research, we searched databases of the published academic literature (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science) and websites of governmental and non-governmental organizations. Two investigators reviewed 3049 abstracts and full-text articles against inclusion/exclusion criteria and assessed the quality of 22 identified articles. Most studies were hampered by methodological challenges, with 12 of 22 not meeting minimum quality criteria. Of 10 studies included in the review, most (6) examined the effect of facility type on patient safety. Existing research appears to indicate no difference in patient safety for outpatient procedures performed in ASCs vs. physician offices. Research about specific facility characteristics is insufficient to draw conclusions. CONCLUSIONS More and higher quality research is needed to determine if there is a public health problem to be addressed through facility regulation and, if so, which facility characteristics may result in consistent improvements to patient safety while not adversely affecting patient experience or service availability.","Berglas, Nancy F; Battistelli, Molly F; Nicholson, Wanda K; Sobota, Mindy; Urman, Richard D; Roberts, Sarah C M",PloS one,368,1

Monitoring and treatment of PKU patients can be complicated in challenging circumstances as pandemics. This study aims to evaluate the impact of telemedicine for monitoring and treatment of PKU patients on metabolic outcome during coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) outbreak. Materials and Methods: Patients who were diagnosed as PKU and treated with low Phe diet, tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), or BH4 adjunct with low Phe diet were enrolled. Study period was divided into two periods: prepandemic period wherein patients were followed up in outpatients' clinic and during pandemic wherein telemedicine was used. Demographic findings, laboratory results, and therapy responses were reviewed retrospectively and compared between the two periods. All procedures were in accordance with the ethical standards of the local ethical committee of Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty (17/11/2020-151640) and with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2013. Results: Ninety-three (n = 93) patients were enrolled to this study. The ratio of the samples with Phe levels in the recommended ranges was found to be statistically higher during the pandemic wherein an online monitoring system was used in all treatment modalities (p < 0.05). The decrease in Phe washout frequency was statistically significant during the pandemic in the low Phe diet group (p < 0.05). Considering the relationship between Phe tolerance before and during the pandemic, a significant increase in Phe tolerance was noted during the pandemic in the low Phe diet group (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Telemedicine can be an appropriate and effective monitoring option for PKU patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Zubarioglu, Tanyel; Hopurcuoglu, Duhan; Uygur, Esma; Ahmadzada, Saffa; Oge-Enver, Ece; Isat, Esra; Cansever, Mehmet Serif; Kiykim, Ertugrul; Aktuglu-Zeybek, Cigdem",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,368,29

We investigated whether these changes would occur in conjunction with favourable alterations in meal-related gut hormone secretion and insulin processing. METHODS Forty participants with type 2 diabetes and 22 participants without diabetes from the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS-2) study were enrolled in a separate, longitudinal cohort (LABS-3 Diabetes) to examine the mechanisms of postsurgical diabetes improvement. Study procedures included measures of SI, islet secretory response and gastrointestinal hormone secretion after both intravenous glucose (frequently-sampled IVGTT [FSIVGTT]) and a mixed meal (MM) prior to and up to 24 months after RYGB. RESULTS Postoperatively, weight loss and SI-FSIVGTT improvement was similar in both groups, whereas the acute insulin response to glucose (AIRglu) decreased in the non-diabetic participants and increased in the participants with type 2 diabetes. The resulting disposition indices (DIFSIVGTT) increased by three- to ninefold in both groups. In contrast, during the MM, total insulin responsiveness did not significantly change in either group despite durable increases of up to eightfold in postprandial glucagon-like peptide 1 levels, and SI-MM and DIMM increased only in the diabetes group. Peak postprandial glucagon levels increased in both groups. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION For up to 2 years following RYGB, obese participants without diabetes showed improvements in DI that approach population norms. Those with type 2 diabetes recovered islet-cell insulin secretion response yet continued to manifest abnormal insulin processing, with DI values that remained well below population norms. These data suggest that, rather than waiting for lifestyle or medical failure, RYGB is ideally considered before, or as soon as possible after, onset of type 2 diabetes.

METHODS Between August 2013 and April 2015, we performed four consecutive laparoscopic total gastrectomies with double tract reconstruction for duodenal surveillance. Three of the patients were diagnosed with gastric cancer, while the remaining patient was diagnosed with gastric carcinoid. RESULTS No deaths occurred, and three of the patients showed no early complications. One patient with Crohn's disease developed anastomotic leakage, but it was successfully managed conservatively. On endoscopy three to seven months later, we were able to observe the duodenum via jejunal anastomosis in all of the patients. DISCUSSION Roux-en-Y reconstruction is one of the options after laparoscopic total gastrectomy. However, given that periodical endoscopic examinations of the duodenum are strongly recommended after surgery, double-tract reconstruction may be preferable in these patients. CONCLUSION Although more detailed data are required, double-tract reconstruction may be the best choice for patients requiring total gastrectomy with regular check-up of the duodenum.","Otsuka, Ryota; Hayashi, Hideki; Hanari, Naoyuki; Gunji, Hisashi; Hayano, Koichi; Kano, Masayuki; Matsubara, Hisahiro",Annals of medicine and surgery,368,1

METHODS In this cross-sectional study, an online-based anonymous survey was conducted within the Convention of University Professors of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery in Germany from April 3 to April 11, 2020. A bipolar 5-point Likert scale (with possible responses of ""totally disagree,"" ""rather disagree,"" ""neutral,"" ""rather agree,"" and ""totally agree"") was applied. Fifty-two (69.3%) of 75 clinic directors participated. RESULTS Communication and cooperation with the government, hospital administration, and other departments during the COVID-19 pandemic were mainly perceived as appropriate. However, only 7 respondents (13.7%) totally agreed or rather agreed with the statement that the authorities are supporters of orthopaedic and trauma surgery departments. Substantial financial and personnel changes in orthopaedic and trauma surgery departments of university hospitals were reported, resulting in an average reduction of 49.4% in operating room capacity and an expected 29.3% loss of revenue. In addition, 14.7% of physicians were reallocated from orthopaedic and trauma surgery to other care-delivery environments. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on orthopaedic and trauma surgery departments in German university hospitals. Distinct structural and financial effects were noted. Nevertheless, the present study demonstrates the commitment of our specialty to overcome the pandemic by providing competent personnel as well as close cooperation with the hospital administration and other departments. CLINICAL RELEVANCE To our knowledge, this is the first Germany-wide survey among the heads of orthopaedic and trauma surgery departments in university hospitals on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

METHODS Overall, 120 of 159 consecutive cases isolated due to suspected COVID-19 at our hospital between 17 and 25 March 2020 were included in this retrospective study. All patients underwent both chest CT and RT-PCR at first admission. The patients were divided into two groups: laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 and clinically diagnosed COVID-19. Clinical findings, laboratory findings, radiologic features and CT severity index (CT-SI) of the patients were noted. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of chest CT were calculated for the diagnosis of COVID-19, using RT-PCR as reference. RESULTS The laboratory-confirmed and clinically diagnosed COVID-19 groups consisted of 69 (M/F 43/26, mean age 50.9±14.0 years) and 51 patients (M/F 24/27, mean age 50.9±18.8 years), respectively. Dry cough (62.3% vs. 52.9%), fever (30.4% vs. 25.5%) and dyspnea (23.2% vs. 27.5%) were the most common admission symptoms in the laboratory-confirmed and clinically diagnosed COVID-19 groups, respectively. Bilateral multilobe involvement (83.1% vs. 57.5%), peripheral distribution (96.9% vs. 97.5%), patchy shape (75.4% vs. 70.0%), ground-glass opacities (GGO) (96.9% vs. 100.0%), vascular enlargement (56.9% vs. 50.0%), intralobular reticular density (40.0% vs. 40.0%) and bronchial wall thickening (27.7% vs. 45.0%) were the most common CT findings in the laboratory-confirmed and clinically diagnosed COVID-19 subgroups, respectively. Except for the bilateral involvement and white blood cell (WBC) count, no difference was found between the clinical, laboratory, and parenchymal findings of the two groups. Positive correlation was found between CT-SI and, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and C-reactive protein (CRP) values in the laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 subgroup. Chest CT and RT-PCR positivity rates among patients with suspected COVID-19 were 87.5% (105/120) and 57.5% (69/120), respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and accuracy rates of chest CT were determined as 94.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 85.8-98.4), 21.57% (95% CI, 11.3-35.3), 61.90% (95% CI, 58.2-65.5), 73.3% (95% CI, 48.2-89.1) and 63.3% (95% CI, 54.1-71.9), respectively.

We found that labyrinthopeptins A1 and A2, the prototype congeners of carbacyclic lanthipeptides, inhibit the proliferation of diverse enveloped viruses, including Dengue virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, Hepatitis C virus, Chikungunya virus, Karposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpes virus, Cytomegalovirus, and Herpes Simplex virus, in the low μM to nM range. Mechanistic studies on viral particles revealed that labyrinthopeptins induce a virolytic effect through binding to the viral membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). These effects are enhanced by a combined equimolar application of both labyrinthopeptins, and a clear synergism was observed across a concentration range corresponding to IC10-IC90 values of the compounds. Time-resolved experiments with large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs) reveal that membrane lipid raft compositions (PC/PE/Chol/SM (17:10:33:40)) are particularly sensitive to labyrinthopeptins compared to PC/PE (90:10) LUVs, even though the overall PE-amount remains constant. Labyrinthopeptins exhibited low cytotoxicity and had favorable pharmacokinetic properties in mice (t1/2= 10.0 h), which designates them as promising antiviral compounds acting by an unusual viral lipid targeting mechanism.Importance For many viral infections, current treatment options are insufficient. Because the development of each antiviral drug is time-consuming and expensive, the prospect of finding broad-spectrum antivirals that can fight multiple, diverse viruses - well-known as well as (re-)emerging species - has gained attention, especially for the treatment of viral co-infections. While most known broad spectrum agents address processes in the host cell, we found that targeting lipids of the free virus outside the host cell with the natural products labyrinthopeptin A1 and A2 is a viable strategy to inhibit the proliferation of a broad range of viruses from different families, including Chikungunya virus, Dengue virus, Zika virus, Karposi's Sarcoma-associated Herpes virus, or Cytomegalovirus. Labyrinthopeptins bind to viral phosphatidylethanolamine and induce virolysis without exerting cytotoxicity to host cells. This represents a novel and unusual mechanism to tackle medically relevant viral infections.","Prochnow, Hans; Rox, Katharina; Birudukota, N V Suryanarayana; Weichert, Loreen; Hotop, Sven-Kevin; Klahn, Philipp; Mohr, Kathrin; Franz, Sergej; Banda, Dominic H; Blockus, Sebastian; Schreiber, Janine; Haid, Sibylle; Oeyen, Merel; Martinez, Javier P; Süssmuth, Roderich D; Wink, Joachim; Meyerhans, Andreas; Goffinet, Christine; Messerle, Martin; Schulz, Thomas F; Kröger, Andrea; Schols, Dominique; Pietschmann, Thomas; Brönstrup, Mark",Journal of virology,368,1

Methods This is a single-center cohort study of sequentially hospitalized patients with COVID-19 at Stony Brook University Medical Center from March 7, 2020 to April 1, 2020, inclusive of these dates. Data collection included history of known comorbidities, medications, vital signs and laboratory values (admission and during the hospitalization). Outcomes include inflammatory burden (composite scores for multiple markers of inflammation), acute kidney injury (AKI), admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), need for invasive mechanical ventilation, and mortality. Results Of the 300 patients in the study cohort, 80 patients (26.7%) had history of ACEI or ARB use prior to admission, with 61.3% (49/80) of these patients continuing the medications during hospitalization. Multivariable analysis revealed that the history of ACEI or ARB use prior to hospitalization was not associated with worse outcomes. In addition, the continuation of these agents during hospitalization was not associated with an increase in adverse outcomes and predicted fewer ICU admissions (OR=0.25, 0.08-0.81) with a decrease in the severity of inflammatory burden (peak CRP (6.9±3.1mg/dl, p=0.03) and peak inflammation score (2.3±1.1unit reduction, p=0.04)).

Methods Total RNA was extracted from effusion samples from 20 cats with confirmed FIP and 23 cats with other diseases. Feline coronavirus RNA was detected using a reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay (qRT-PCR), and positive samples underwent pyrosequencing of position 1058 with or without Sanger sequencing of position 1060 in the FCoV spike protein. Results Seventeen (85%) of the effusion samples from 20 cats with FIP were positive for FCoV RNA, whereas none of the 23 cats with other diseases were positive. Pyrosequencing of the 17 FCoV-positive samples showed that 11 (65%) of the cats had leucine and two (12%) had methionine at position 1058. Of the latter two samples with methionine, one had alanine at position 1060. Conclusions and relevance A positive FCoV qRT-PCR result on effusions appears specific for FIP and may be a useful diagnostic marker for FIP in cats with effusions. The majority of FCoVs contained amino acid changes previously associated with systemic spread or virulence (FIP) of the virus.","Longstaff, Louise; Porter, Emily; Crossley, Victoria J; Hayhow, Sophie E; Helps, Christopher R; Tasker, Séverine",Journal of feline medicine and surgery,368,33

Patients in group B (n = 20) underwent SILS cholecystectomy. In all patients, preincisional local infiltration of ropivacaine around the trocar wounds was performed. Infusion of ropivacaine solution in the right subdiaphragmatic area at the beginning of the procedure plus normal saline infusion in the same area at the end of the procedure was performed in all patients as well. Shoulder tip and abdominal pain were registered at 2, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h postoperatively using visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS Significantly lower pain scores were observed in the SILS group versus the classic laparoscopic cholecystectomy group after the first 12 h for abdominal pain, and after the first 6 h for shoulder pain. Total pain after the first 24 h was nonexistent in the SILS group. Also, requests for analgesics were significantly less in the SILS group, while no difference was observed in incidence of nausea and vomiting between the two groups. CONCLUSION SILS cholecystectomy, as well as the invisible scar, has significantly lower abdominal and shoulder pain scores, especially after the first 24 h postoperatively, when this pain is nonexistent.

This need is more urgent in resource-constrained settings. The present study aimed to identify the predictors of ICU admission among hospitalized COVID-19 patients. STUDY DESIGN The current study was conducted based on a retrospective cohort design. . METHODS The participants included 665 definite cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) hospitalized in Imam Hossein Hospital from February 20 to May 14, 2020. The baseline characteristics of patients were assessed, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was utilized to determine the significant odds ratio (OR) for ICU admission. RESULTS Participants were aged 59.52±16.72 years, and the majority (55.6%) of them were male. Compared to non-ICU patients (n=547), the ICU patients (n=118) were older, had more baseline comorbidities, and presented more often with dyspnea, convulsion, loss of consciousness, tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypoxia, and less often with myalgia. Significant OR (95% CI) of ICU admission was observed for the 60-80 age group (2.42, 95%CI: 1.01; 5.79), ≥80 age group (3.73, 95%CI: 1.44; 9.42), ≥3 comorbidities (2.07, 95%CI: 1.31; 3.80), loss of consciousness (6.70, 95%CI: 2.94, 15.24), tachypnea (1.79, 95%CI: 1.03, 3.11), and SpO2<90 (5.83, 95%CI: 2.74; 12.4). Abnormal laboratory results were more common among ICU-admitted patients; in this regard, leukocytosis (4.45, 95%CI: 1.49, 13.31), lymphopenia (2.39, 95%CI: 1.30; 4.39), elevated creatine phosphokinase (CPK) (1.99, 95%CI: 1.04; 3.83), and increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (2.25, 95%CI: 1.18-4.30) had a significant OR of ICU admission. Chest computer tomography (CT) revealed that consolidation (1.82, 95%CI: 1.02, 3.24), pleural effusion (3.19, 95%CI: 1.71, 5.95), and crazy paving pattern (8.36, 95%CI: 1.92, 36.48) had a significant OR of ICU admission. CONCLUSION As evidenced by the obtained results, the predictors of ICU admission were identified among epidemiological characteristics, presenting symptoms and signs, laboratory tests, and chest CT findings.","Hatami, Hossein; Soleimantabar, Hussein; Ghasemian, Mehrdad; Delbari, Negar; Aryannezhad, Shayan",Journal of research in health sciences,368,28

METHODS Sixty-seven TA patients, who had IL-6 levels detected at the first visit and had a regular follow-up of at least 2 years, were enrolled. Data recorded up to March 31, 2019, including clinical presentations, laboratory indices, treatments, and radiological images were collected and used for analysis. The value of IL-6 in predicting disease relapse and imaging progression was analyzed. RESULTS IL-6 levels were positively related with disease activity index, including Kerr scores, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Patients were divided into three groups according to baseline serum IL-6 levels: low group (< 5.4 pg/mL, n = 29), medium group (5.4-11.5 pg/mL, n = 20), and high group (> 11.5 ng/mL, n = 18). Patients in the medium and high group had higher disease activity than those in the low group (p < 0.01). Baseline IL-6 levels were correlated with luminal stenosis (p < 0.05), although no significant correlations with long-term imaging progression were observed. Patients with more than 2 episodes of disease relapses were most commonly seen in the medium group (p < 0.05). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis indicated that medium and high IL-6 levels were positive predictors for disease relapse (HR 4.3, 95%CI 1.3-18.7 p = 0.07 for medium group; HR 2.1, 95% CI 0.7-48.9, p = 0.19 for high group) with disease status and treatment adjusted. CONCLUSIONS IL-6 may be a valuable predictor of TA disease relapse during long-term follow-up. Treatments targeted at IL-6 pathways might reduce disease relapse and have better prognostic effects for TA.Key Points• Positive relationships between IL-6 levels and disease activity index, including Kerr scores, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, etc. were indicated.• Medium and high baseline IL-6 levels were valuable for predicting disease relapse during the 2-year follow-up.• Baseline IL-6 levels were positively correlated with luminal stenosis on imaging.","Sun, Ying; Kong, Xiufang; Cui, Xiaomeng; Dai, Xiaomin; Ma, Lili; Chen, Huiyong; Chen, Rongyi; Lv, Peng; Lin, Jiang; Huang, Qingrong; Jin, Xuejuan; Jiang, Lindi",Clinical rheumatology,368,16

The goal of this study was to quantify changes in medical care during the first wave of the pandemic using radiological examinations as a comprehensive surrogate marker and to determine potential future workload. METHODS A retrospective analysis of all radiological examinations during the first wave of the pandemic was performed. The number of examinations was compared to time-matched control periods. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of radiological examinations attributed to various medical specialties was conducted and postponed examinations were extrapolated to calculate additional workload in the near future. RESULTS A total of 596,760 examinations were analyzed. Overall case volumes decreased by an average of 41 % during the shutdown compared to the control period. The most affected radiological modalities were sonography (-54 %), X-ray (-47 %) followed by MRI (-42 %). The most affected medical specialty was trauma and orthopedics (-60 % case volume) followed by general surgery (-49 %). Examination numbers increased during the post-shutdown period leading to a predicted additional workload of up to 22 %. CONCLUSION This study shows a marked decrease in radiological examinations in total and among several core medical specialties, indicating a significant reduction in medical care during the first COVID-19 shutdown. KEY POINTS · Number of radiological examinations decreased by 41 % during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.. · Several core medical specialties were heavily affected with a reduction of case volumes up to 60 %.. · When extrapolating postponed examinations to the near future, the overall workload for radiological departments might increase up to 22 %..

We aimed to characterize unit culture differences at hospitals that successfully reduced their cesarean rates compared with those that did not. METHODS A mixed methods study of California hospitals participating in a statewide initiative to reduce cesarean delivery. Participants included nurses, obstetricians, family physicians, midwives, and anesthesiologists practicing at participating hospitals. Hospitals' net change in nulliparous, term, singleton, and vertex cesarean delivery rates classified them as successful if they achieved either a minimum 5 percentage point reduction or rate of fewer than 24%. The Labor Culture Survey was used to quantify differences in unit culture. Key informant interviews were used to explore quantitative findings and characterize additional cultural barriers and facilitators. RESULTS Out of 55 hospitals, 37 (n = 840 clinicians) meeting inclusion criteria participated in the Labor Culture Survey. Physicians' individual attitudes differed by hospital success on 5 scales: best practices (P = .003), fear (P = .001), cesarean safety (P = .014), physician oversight (P <.001), and microculture (P = .044) scales. Patient ability to make informed decisions showed poor agreement across all hospitals, but was higher at successful hospitals (38% vs 29%, P = .01). Important qualitative themes included: ease of access to shared resources on best practices, fear of bad outcomes, personal resistance to change, collaborative practice and effective communication, leadership engagement, and cultural flexibility. CONCLUSIONS Successful hospitals' culture and context was measurably different from nonresponders. Leveraging these contextual factors may facilitate success.","White VanGompel, Emily C; Perez, Susan L; Datta, Avisek; Carlock, Francesca R; Cape, Valerie; Main, Elliott K",Annals of family medicine,368,24

We hypothesized that human fibrinogen concentrate (FC) and prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), administered as combined therapy with TXA, would provide additive effects for reducing blood loss in an animal trauma model. METHODS Thirty-six pigs were subjected to 2 consecutive blunt liver injuries, resulting in severe hemorrhagic shock and coagulopathy. Intervention comprised saline (control group); TXA (15 mg kg, TXA group); TXA and FC (90 mg kg, TXA-FC); or TXA, FC, and PCC (20 U kg, TXA-FC-PCC). Blood loss, thromboelastometry (ROTEM), measures of thrombin generation, platelet activation, and global coagulation variables were monitored for 4 hours. Tissue sections were examined to determine the occurrence of thromboembolic events. RESULTS Total blood loss was similar in the TXA-FC and TXA-FC-PCC groups (mean ± SD: 1012 ± 86 mL and 1037 ± 118 mL, respectively; P = 1.000). These values were both lower (P < 0.001) than the TXA group (1579 ± 306 mL). Blood loss in all 3 intervention groups was lower (P < 0.001) than in the control group (2376 ± 478 mL). After trauma and resuscitation, but before study intervention, plasma fibrinogen levels were severely depleted (median for the whole study population: 66 mg dL; interquartile range: 51-108 mg dL) and clot strength was decreased (EXTEM whole-blood maximum clot firmness [MCF]: 53 ± 5 mm). Compared with controls, TXA inhibited fibrinolysis and stabilized MCF and clotting time. The addition of FC restored and stabilized hemostasis to a greater extent than TXA alone; the addition of PCC had no statistically significant impact on blood loss, clot strength (MCF), or clotting time, but it increased thrombin generation. There were no significant differences among the study groups regarding platelet activation. No thrombi or microthrombi were observed in any group at necropsy. CONCLUSIONS The early use of TXA and FC reduced blood loss and improved coagulation measurements in a porcine model of blunt liver injury and hemorrhagic shock. FC, administered in addition to TXA, was highly effective in reducing blood loss. The lack of statistically significant reduction in blood loss when PCC was added to TXA and FC may be attributable to the absence of thrombin generation impairment in this model.","Zentai, Christian; van der Meijden, Paola E J; Braunschweig, Till; Hueck, Nicolai; Honickel, Markus; Spronk, Henri M H; Rossaint, Rolf; Grottke, Oliver",Anesthesia and analgesia,368,1

As the chronological age advances, physiological and psychosocial decline will be evident among all older adults. The potentially relevant literature was identified using appropriate search terms in electronic databases such as PubMed MEDLINE, Scopus, ProQuest, Web of Science, CINAHL, IndMed, and Google Scholar. Articles published from 2006 to 2019, reported the prevalence and the risk factors for depression among older adults living in the community, old age homes, or hospitals of the South Asian countries. Articles were published in the languages other than English and those reporting the categorised or mean depressive scores were excluded from the review. After quality check for all the retrieved articles from different databases, 120 articles were included for the meta-analysis. The data were extracted based on a validated data extraction form, and the reviewer contacted the authors for clarification of the missing data whenever required. The estimates were pooled using the random effect model for meta-analyses. Sub-group and sensitivity analyses were also performed. The overall pooled estimate (random effect models) of the prevalence of depression among the elderly was 42.0% (95% CI: 0.38-0.46), Chi-squared P-value <0.001, and I2 99.14%.

Besides tobacco, smoke infectious diseases such as human papillomavirus (HPV) might be involved in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. However, data are inconsistent due to differences in study design and HPV detection methods. AIM A systematic meta-analysis was performed to examine the presence of HPV-infection with lung cancer. METHODS AND RESULTS All studies in all languages were considered for the search concepts ""lung cancer"" and ""HPV"" if data specific to HPV prevalence in lung cancer tissue were given. This included Journal articles as well as abstracts and conference reports. As detection method, only HPV PCR results from fresh frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue were included. Five bibliographic databases and three registers of clinical trials including MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched through February 2020. A total 4298 publications were identified, and 78 publications were selected, resulting in 9385 included lung cancer patients. A meta-analysis of 15 case-control studies with n = 2504 patients showed a weighted overall prevalence difference of 22% (95% CI: 12%-33%; P < .001) and a weighted overall 4.7-fold (95% CI: 2.7-8.4; P < .001) increase of HPV prevalence in lung cancer patients compared to controls. Overall, HPV prevalence amounted to 13.5% being highest in Asia (16.6%), followed by America (12.8%), and Europe (7.0%). A higher HPV prevalence was found in squamous cell carcinoma (17.9%) compared to adenocarcinoma (P < .01) with significant differences in geographic patterns. HPV genotypes 16 and 18 were the most prevalent high-risk genotypes identified.

The virus has mostly affected elderly populations, but there may be corollary effects on young adults' psychosocial adjustment due to educational, economic, and occupational disruptions. Using latent class analysis, we examined unique typologies of coping in response to the pandemic among young adults. We used an expanded set of indicators including traditional measures of problem- and emotion-focused coping as well as measures of resilience and coping flexibility. We also examined whether class membership could be predicted by demographics, stress appraisal, and psychosocial characteristics including catastrophic thinking and impulsivity. The sample of 1,391 young adults (ages 18-35) was recruited via Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk) and snowball methods from late-April to early-May 2020. Six classes were identified: (1) Resilient Flexible Problem-Focused Copers, (2) Resilient Inflexible Problem-Focused Copers, (3) Non-Resilient Flexible Problem-Focused Venters, (4) Non-Resilient Flexible Problem-Focused Copers, (5) Non-Resilient Flexible Non-Copers, and (6) Non-Resilient Inflexible Non-Copers. Using Class 1 as the reference class, we found perceived centrality and uncontrollability of the pandemic as well as catastrophic thinking and impulsivity were significant predictors of class membership. The mean levels of stress appraisal and psychosocial characteristics varied significantly between the classes, reinforcing the structural validity of these classes. The findings suggest the importance of training young adults to develop resilience and flexibility as well as specific coping skills that can help offset the psychological effects of dramatic lifestyle changes that may result from pandemics or other health crises in the future.","Shigeto, Aya; Laxman, Daniel J; Landy, Justin F; Scheier, Lawrence M",The Journal of general psychology,368,24

We present the principles of nBCA preparation and delivery for tumor embolization of a right convexity meningioma in a patient who presented with a 6-month history of word-finding difficulty and memory loss video 1 Angiography of the middle meningeal artery showed a hairpin turn that was not negotiable with a number of different microwires, including the Synchro-2, Chikai 014 and Balt hybrid 008 wire. Due to the tortuous hairpin turn, the microcatheter position was distal to the tumor blush for the convexity meningioma. Given the distal microcatheter position, we opted for nBCA as the liquid embolic of choice for tumor embolization. The time of polymerization for nBCA may be delayed using glacial acetic acid, which makes nBCA ideal when the microcatheter is in a distal position relative to the target location for embolization.

'Batesian'-type mimicry entails a conflict of interest between sender and receiver, reflected in a deceptive mimic signal. 'Müllerian'-type mimicry occurs when there is perfect common interest between sender and receiver in a particular type of encounter, manifested by an honest co-mimic signal. Using a signalling games approach, simulations show that invasion by Batesian mimics will make Müllerian mimicry unstable, in a coevolutionary chase. We use these results to better understand the deceptive strategies of SARS-CoV-2 and their key role in the COVID-19 pandemic. At the biomolecular level, we explain how cellularization promotes Müllerian molecular mimicry, and discourages Batesian molecular mimicry. A wide range of processes analogous to cellularization are presented; these might represent a manner of reducing oscillatory instabilities. Lastly, we identify examples of mimicry in human society that might be addressed using a signalling game approach.","Casey, William; Massey, Steven E; Mishra, Bud","Journal of the Royal Society, Interface",368,24

A socioeconomic-ethno-genetic cline was established soon after the conquest. Spaniards born in Spain or Chile occupied the highest Socioeconomic Strata, while Amerindians belonged to the lowest. The intermediate strata consisted of people with different degrees of ethnic admixture; the larger the European admixture, the higher the Socioeconomic Level. The present study of molecular genomic markers sought to calculate the percentage of Amerindian admixture and revealed a finer distribution of this cline, as well as differences between two Amerindian groups: Aymara and Mapuche. The use of two socioeconomic classifications - Class and Socioeconomic Level - reveals important differences. Furthermore, Self-reported Ethnicity (self-assignment to an ethnic group) and Self-reported Ancestry (self-recognition of Amerindian ancestors) show variations and differing relationships between socioeconomic classifications and genomic Amerindian Admixture. These data constitute a valuable input for the formulation of public healthcare policy and show that the notions of Ethnicity, Socioeconomic Strata and Class should always be a consideration in policy development.","Barozet, E; Valenzuela, C Y; Cifuentes, L; Verdugo, R A; Herrera, L; Acuña, M; Llop, E; Moraga, M; Berríos, S; Di Genova, A; Digman, D; Symon, A; Asenjo, S; López, P; Bustamante, M L; Pezo-Valderrama, P; Suazo, J; Caba, F; Villalón, M; Alvarado, S; Cáceres, D; Salgado, K; Portales, P; Loira, N; Maas, A",Biodemography and social biology,368,1

Evidence-based information sustaining these decisions is frequently lacking. The aim of this paper is to propose a practical clinical approach to cognitive impairments in patients with known cerebrovascular disease. Methods The document was produced by the Dementia Committee of the European Stroke Organisation (ESO), based on evidence from the literature where available and on the clinical experience of the Committee members. This paper was endorsed by the ESO. Findings Many patients with stroke or other cerebrovascular disease have cognitive impairment, but this is often not recognized. With improvement in acute stroke care, and with the ageing of populations, it is expected that more stroke survivors and more patients with cerebrovascular disease will need adequate management of cognitive impairment of vascular etiology. This document was conceived for the use of strokologists and for those clinicians involved in cerebrovascular disease, with specific and practical hints concerning diagnostic tools, cognitive impairment management and decision on some therapeutic options.Discussion and conclusions: It is essential to consider a possible cognitive deterioration in every patient who experiences a stroke. Neuropsychological evaluation should be adapted to the clinical status. Brain imaging is the most informative biomarker concerning prognosis. Treatment should always include adequate secondary prevention.","Verdelho, Ana; Wardlaw, Joanna; Pavlovic, Aleksandra; Pantoni, Leonardo; Godefroy, Olivier; Duering, Marco; Charidimou, Andreas; Chabriat, Hugues; Biessels, Geert Jan",European stroke journal,368,28

Current antemortem IAV surveillance strategies in swine require collecting nasal swabs, which entails restraining pigs with snares. Restraint is labor-intensive for samplers, stressful for pigs, and displeasing to onlookers because pigs often resist and vocalize. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the utility of snout wipes in exhibition swine as a method to make IAV surveillance efforts less intrusive, less labor-intensive, and more widely accepted among pig owners and exhibition officials. METHODS Three materials (rayon/polyester gauze, cotton gauze, and Swiffer(®) Sweeper dry cloths) were inoculated with IAV, and viral recoveries from these materials were quantified using qRT-PCR and TCID50 assays. In a field trial, paired cotton gauze snout wipes and gold standard polyester-tipped nasal swabs were collected from 553 pigs representing 29 agricultural fairs and the qualitative results of rRT-PCR and viral isolation were compared. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS Viral recoveries from potential snout wipe materials ranged from 0.26 to 1.59 log10 TCID50 /ml less than that of the positive control in which no substrate was included; rayon/polyester gauze performed significantly worse than the other materials. In the field, snout wipes and nasal swabs had high levels of agreement for both rRT-PCR detection and virus isolation. Although further investigation and refinement of the sampling method is needed, results indicate that snout wipes will facilitate convenient and undisruptive IAV surveillance in pigs at agricultural fairs.","Edwards, Jody L; Nelson, Sarah W; Workman, Jeffrey D; Slemons, Richard D; Szablewski, Christine M; Nolting, Jacqueline M; Bowman, Andrew S",Influenza and other respiratory viruses,368,1

METHODS AND ANALYSIS A prospective, multicentre, observational, cohort study of 300 patients prescribed budesonide MMX for the treatment of mild-to-moderate active UC will be conducted in Europe, Israel and Canada. Patients will be treated with budesonide MMX9 mg daily for induction of remission for ≤8 weeks. Data on effectiveness, including patient-reported outcomes, tolerability and use will be recorded at the end of treatment and at ≥2 weeks after. The primary outcome (improvement ≥3 point in the clinical subscores of the UC Disease Activity Index score at the end of treatment) will be compared in: patients who receive budesonide MMX added to mesalazine >2 weeks after increased/optimised mesalazine dose for the treatment of flare (late add-on); patients who receive budesonide MMX added to mesalazine ≤2 weeks since mesalazine increased/optimised for the treatment of flare, or without mesalazine dose modification (early add-on); and patients who receive budesonide MMX as monotherapy for the treatment of flare (mono).

Accordingly, statins decrease the risk of developing atherosclerosis and its acute complications, such as acute myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Besides the LDL-C-lowering impact, statins also have other so-called pleiotropic effects. Among them, the ability to modulate differentiation and function of bone cells and exert direct effects on osteosynthesis factors. Specifically, earlier studies have shown that statins cause in vitro and in vivo osteogenic differentiation. Statins increase the expression of many mediators involved in bone metabolism, including bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), glucocorticoids, transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), type I collagen, and collagenase-1. As a result, they enhance bone formation and improve bone mineral density by modulating osteoblast and osteoclast differentiation. This review article summarizes the literature exploring bone-related ""pleiotropic"" effects of statins and suggesting an anabolic role in the bone tissue for such a drug class. Accordingly, current knowledge encourages further clinical trials to assess their therapeutic potential in the treatment of bone disorders, such as arthritis and osteoporosis.","Chamani, Sajad; Liberale, Luca; Mobasheri, Leila; Montecucco, Fabrizio; Al-Rasadi, Khalid; Jamialahmadi, Tannaz; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",European journal of clinical investigation,368,31

Recently, using a multi-omics-based strategy, we predicted potential drugs for COVID-19 with ∼70% accuracy. Herein, using a novel multi-omics-based bioinformatic approach and three ways of analysis, we identified the symptoms, comorbid conditions, and short-, mid-, and possible long-term complications of COVID-19 with >90% precision including 27 parent, 170 child, and 403 specific conditions. Among the specific conditions, 36 viral, 53 short-term, 62 short-mid-long-term, 194 mid-long-term, and 57 congenital conditions are identified. At a threshold ""count of occurrence"" of 4, we found that 83-100% (average 92.67%) of enriched conditions are associated with COVID-19. Except for dry cough and loss of taste, all the other COVID-19-associated mild and severe symptoms are enriched. CVDs, and pulmonary, metabolic, musculoskeletal, neuropsychiatric, kidney, liver, and immune system disorders are top comorbid conditions. Specific diseases like myocardial infarction, hypertension, COPD, lung injury, diabetes, cirrhosis, mood disorders, dementia, macular degeneration, chronic kidney disease, lupus, arthritis, etc. along with several other NCDs were found to be top candidates. Interestingly, many cancers and congenital disorders associated with COVID-19 severity are also identified. Arthritis, gliomas, diabetes, psychiatric disorders, and CVDs having a bidirectional relationship with COVID-19 are also identified as top conditions. Based on our accuracy (>90%), the long-term presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in human, and our ""genetic remittance"" assumption, we hypothesize that all the identified top-ranked conditions could be potential long-term consequences in COVID-19 survivors, warranting long-term observational studies.","Barh, Debmalya; Tiwari, Sandeep; Andrade, Bruno Silva; Weener, Marianna E; Góes-Neto, Aristóteles; Azevedo, Vasco; Ghosh, Preetam; Blum, Kenneth; Ganguly, Nirmal Kumar",Molecular omics,368,30

A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,19.30633,9.695928,2021-10-08,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) is a clinicoradiological syndrome characterized by acute cerebral endotheliopathy with consecutive disruption of the blood-brain barrier and vasogenic edema. Since its first description in 1996, PRES is increasingly recognized. However, many aspects of this syndrome with its wide spectrum of clinical and radiological features are still incompletely understood. In this review, possible pathophysiological mechanisms, approaches to diagnosis, recent study results on outcome, and future directions of research are described. RECENT FINDINGS Clinical manifestations of PRES include seizures, headache, visual disturbances, altered mental state, and more rarely hemiparesis or aphasia. Vasogenic edema predominantly occurs in the parieto-occipital region, but lesions affecting formerly called 'atypical' regions such as frontal lobe, cerebellum, or basal ganglia are common. If treated early and adequately, that is by removal of the underlying cause, PRES has a favorable prognosis, but neurological residual symptoms and even mortality can occur, particularly in patients with complications such as intracranial hemorrhage. SUMMARY In summary, validated diagnostic criteria and algorithms are warranted to standardize the diagnosis of PRES. This is essential for further research and future prospective studies that should investigate risk factors for unfavorable outcome and identify the roles of imaging features, clinical symptoms, and other biomarkers in predicting outcome.","Liman, Thomas G; Siebert, Eberhard; Endres, Matthias",Current opinion in neurology,368,1

The present study was undertaken to define the baseline characteristics of the patients with data entered into BOLD. METHODS The data submitted by >800 surgeons and >450 facilities using BOLD before May 20, 2009, were analyzed. RESULTS A total of 57,918 research-consented patients with surgical procedure data were included. Of the 57,918 patients, 41,243 were adults aged 26-55 years, with few patients aged < or =18 years (.14%) or > or = 66 years (5.67%). Females constituted a significant majority of the study population (45,619 [78.76%]). Of the 57,918 patients, 78.12% registered were described as Caucasian, 10.52% as African-American, 6.02% as Hispanic, .20% as Asian, and .46% as Native American. The most common bariatric surgical procedure was some form of gastric bypass (31,668 [54.68%]), followed by some form of gastric banding (22,947 [39.62%]), sleeve gastrectomy (1,328 [2.29%]), and biliopancreatic diversion (517 [.89%]). The vast majority of index procedures were completed using laparoscopic surgery techniques, except for biliopancreatic diversion, which was primarily done with an open approach. Through May 2009, 78 deaths were reported at any point after the index procedure, for a mortality rate of .13%. The 90-day mortality rate was .11%, and the 30-day mortality rate was .09%.

RESULTS At 18 months after RY gastric bypass, weight losses of respectively 30 ± 11% and 34 ± 9% of total initial body weight were measured in the older and younger patients (p < 0.05). After 12 months, HbA1c dropped below 6.5% in 89% of patients younger and in 81% of patients older than 60 (p = 0.11). There was no mortality in either group, but there were significantly more complications and there was a longer hospital stay in the older patients. CONCLUSION RY gastric bypass comes with a significantly higher morbidity and hospital stay in older patients, but weight loss and improvement of DM are similar as in the younger patients.","Van Nieuwenhove, Y; Spriet, E; Sablon, T; Van Daele, E; Willaert, W; Ceelen, W; Pattyn, P",Acta chirurgica Belgica,368,20

Since cyclic stretch with cycle-by-cycle variability is known to augment surfactant release by epithelial cells, we hypothesized that such in vivo mechanotransduction improves surfactant maturation and hence lung physiology in preterm subjects. We thus tested whether breath-by-breath variability in tidal volume (VT) in variable ventilation (VV) can be tuned for optimal performance in a preterm lamb model. Preterm lambs were ventilated for 3 h with conventional ventilation (CV) or two variants of VV that used a maximum VT of 1.5 (VV1) or 2.25 (VV2) times the mean VT. VT was adjusted during ventilation to a permissive pCO2 target range. Respiratory mechanics were monitored continuously using the forced oscillation technique, followed by postmortem bronchoalveolar lavage and tissue collection. Both VVs outperformed CV in blood gas parameters (pH, SaO2, cerebral O2 saturation). However, only VV2 lowered PaCO2 and had a higher specific respiratory compliance than CV. VV2 also increased surfactant protein (SP)-B release compared to VV1 and stimulated its production compared to CV. The production and release of proSP-C however, was increased with CV compared to both VVs. There was more SP-A in both VVs than CV in the lung, but VV2 downregulated SP-A in the lavage, whereas SP-D significantly increased in CV in both the lavage and lung. Compared to CV, the cytokines IL-1β, and TNFα decreased with both VVs with less inflammation during VV2. Additionally, VV2 lungs showed the most homogeneous alveolar structure and least inflammatory cell infiltration assessed by histology. CV lungs exhibited over-distension mixed with collapsed and interstitial edematous regions with occasional hemorrhage. Following VV1, some lambs had normal alveolar structure while others were similar to CV. The IgG serum proteins in the lavage, a marker of leakage, were the highest in CV. An overall combined index of performance that included physiological, biochemical and histological markers was the best in VV2 followed by VV1. Thus, VV2 outperformed VV1 by enhancing SP-B metabolism resulting in open alveolar airspaces, less leakage and inflammation and hence better respiratory mechanics.","Bartolák-Suki, Erzsébet; Noble, Peter B; Bou Jawde, Samer; Pillow, Jane J; Suki, Béla",Frontiers in physiology,368,30

METHODS Retrospective observational study. RESULTS DBE procedures (n=205) showed small bowel lesions in 64% cases. Antegrade DBE showed positive results in 79% cases, mostly angiodysplasias (63%). Retrograde DBE showed positive results in 22% cases. An intervention was performed in 64% of DBE procedures. The major complication rate was 0.5%, which was one case of perforation. Pancreatitis did not occur. The overall diagnostic agreement was 66% among the 134 DBEs with preceded VCE. CONCLUSIONS In cases of overt or occult bleeding or anemia, DBE was positive in 64%, with only a few complications. Positive correlation was 66% among initially performed VCEs and DBEs. Owing to the time-consuming and invasive character of DBE, performing VCE before DBE might still be clinically relevant.","Hermans, Carlijn; Stronkhorst, Arnold; Tjhie-Wensing, Annemarie; Kamphuis, Jan; Balkom, Bas van; Dahlmans, Rob; Gilissen, Lennard",Clinical endoscopy,368,1

AIM To generate greater understanding of technology adoption and to test strategies supporting virtual care interventions in hospitalised older people with dementia, such as the use of an iPad to connect them with their family members. METHOD Older people with dementia in two Canadian hospitals were observed and interviewed to explore their experiences of using an iPad. Focus groups were conducted with staff and interviews were undertaken with two frontline nurses and three research partners with lived experience of dementia in hospitalised older people. Data were thematically analysed in collaboration with 12 stakeholders. Strategies to overcome the barriers identified were tested as part of the study. FINDINGS There were three main barriers to implementing virtual care interventions: lack of familiarity with the technology; difficulties with operating the device; and privacy and connectivity issues. Strategies to overcome these barriers included providing personalised support, working with users to support adaptation, and ensuring privacy and optimal connectivity. CONCLUSION Using an iPad has the potential to enable hospitalised older people with dementia to connect with their family members and take part in activities that support person-centred care.

By providing key information on the immunogenicity and protective properties of the antibodies elicited by viral proteins, the analytic vaccinology method guides the selection of the most appropriate vaccine candidates. Here we discuss methodologies for the generation of human monoclonal antibodies from B cells of immune donors, antibody screening in in vitro assays of antigen binding and virus neutralization, and strategies of animal immunization useful for the preclinical evaluation of selected viral antigens.

With the ability to encapsulate non-native enzymes, BMCs show high potential for applied use. For this goal, a detailed look into shell form variability is significant to predict shell adaptability. Here we present four novel 3D cryo-EM maps of recombinant Klebsiella pneumoniae GRM2 BMC shell particles with the resolution in range of 9 å to 22 å and nine novel 2D classes corresponding to discrete BMC shell forms. These structures reveal icosahedral, elongated, oblate, multi-layered and polyhedral traits of BMCs, indicating considerable variation in size and form as well as adaptability during shell formation processes.

Methods The exo (miR-27a) were intended to be constructed and identified by transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, Western blot, and real-time fluorescent quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). qRT-PCR was used to evaluate the effect of exo (miR-27a) in delivering miR-27a to osteoblasts (MC3T3-E1 cells). Alkaline phosphatase staining, alizarin red staining, and qRT-PCR were used to evaluate its effect on MC3T3-E1 cells osteogenesis. Dual-luciferase reporter (DLRTM) assay was used to verify whether miR-27a targeting Dickkopf WNT signaling pathway inhibitor 2 (DKK2) was a potential mechanism, and the mechanism was further verified by qRT-PCR, Western blot, and alizarin red staining in MC3T3-E1 cells. Finally, the protective effect of exo (miR-27a) on ONFH was verified by the GC-ONFH model in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. Results Transmission electron microscopy, nanoparticle tracking analysis, Western blot, and qRT-PCR detection showed that exo (miR-27a) was successfully constructed. exo (miR-27a) could effectively deliver miR-27a to MC3T3-E1 cells and enhance their osteogenic capacity. The detection of DLRTM showed that miR-27a promoted bone formation by directly targeting DDK2. Micro-CT and HE staining results of animal experiments showed that tail vein injection of exo (miR-27a) improved the osteonecrosis of SD rat GC-ONFH model. Conclusion exo (miR-27a) can promote bone regeneration and protect against GC-ONFH to some extent.","Zhang, Gensheng; Liu, Ruiyu; Dang, Xiaoqian; Liu, Jichao; Jiao, Haibin",Zhongguo xiu fu chong jian wai ke za zhi = Zhongguo xiufu chongjian waike zazhi = Chinese journal of reparative and reconstructive surgery,368,1

No existing reviews have examined the evidence for preserving or enhancing social health in people living with neurocognitive disorders, such as mild cognitive impairment and dementia. The present review examines recent epidemiological studies and interventions with social health outcome measures, including interventions across multiple modalities and settings, from communities to assisted living facilities. RECENT FINDINGS Epidemiological evidence shows that neurocognitive disorders are associated with poorer social support, and greater social isolation and loneliness. This highlights the importance of maintaining and enhancing social health in people living with neurocognitive disorders. Group activities involving dance or music have emerging evidence indicating improvements in social health in communities and assisted living facilities. More quantitative research is required on the social health benefits of cognitive/multicomponent interventions, community social groups, exercise groups and other interventions. Several socially assistive robots are being developed to help foster social participation and require further research. SUMMARY There is evidence that group music or dance interventions can improve social health for people living with neurocognitive disorders. Larger trials with multiple social health outcome measures are required to investigate the social health benefits of exercise, cognitive/multicomponent and community social group interventions.","Samtani, Suraj; Stevens, Ashley; Brodaty, Henry",Current opinion in psychiatry,368,1

Cognitive dysfunction is common following major surgery and may relate to intra-operative cerebral hypoperfusion. OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate whether internal carotid artery (ICA) blood flow increases when MAP is kept higher than 60 mmHg using noradrenaline. DESIGN A randomised, cross-over trial. SETTING Department of Anaesthesia, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark, from December 2017 to April 2018. PATIENTS Patients with median [IQR] age 71 [63 to 75] years underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (n = 19), total pancreatic resection (n = 1) or gastro-entero anastomosis (n = 2) during combined propofol-remifentanil and thoracic epidural anaesthesia. INTERVENTION MAP was maintained between 60 to 65, 70 to 75 and 80 to 85 mmHg, in a random order, by noradrenaline infusion at a stable level of anaesthesia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome was change in ICA flow at MAP 60 to 65 vs. 80 to 85 mmHg. Secondary outcomes were change in ICA flow at MAP 60 to 65 vs. 70 to 75 and 70 to 75 vs. 80 to 85 mmHg. Duplex ultrasound evaluated ICA flow. RESULTS A (mean ± SD) increase in MAP from 62 ± 1 to 82 ± 1 mmHg elevated ICA flow from 196 ± 53 to 226 ± 61 ml min (mean difference 31 ml min; 95% CI 19 to 42; P < 0.0001). An increase in MAP from 62 ± 1 to 72 ± 1 mmHg elevated ICA flow to 210 ± 52 ml min (P = 0.0271) and ICA flow increased further (P = 0.0165) when MAP was elevated to 82 ± 1 mmHg. CONCLUSION During combined propofol-remifentanil and thoracic epidural anaesthesia, ICA flow increased by approximately 15% when the MAP was elevated from about 60 to 80 mmHg. Treatment of a reduction in MAP brought about by anaesthesia seems to enhance ICA flow.

However, the role of the ERAD pathway in the viral life cycle is poorly defined. In this paper, we demonstrate that hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection activates the ERAD pathway, which in turn controls the fate of viral glycoproteins and modulates virus production. ERAD proteins, such as EDEM1 and EDEM3, were found to increase ubiquitylation of HCV envelope proteins via direct physical interaction. Knocking down of EDEM1 and EDEM3 increased the half-life of HCV E2, as well as virus production, whereas exogenous expression of these proteins reduced the production of infectious virus particles. Further investigation revealed that only EDEM1 and EDEM3 bind with SEL1L, an ER membrane adaptor protein involved in translocation of ERAD substrates from the ER to the cytoplasm. When HCV-infected cells were treated with kifunensine, a potent inhibitor of the ERAD pathway, the half-life of HCV E2 increased and so did virus production. Kifunensine inhibited the binding of EDEM1 and EDEM3 with SEL1L, thus blocking the ubiquitylation of HCV E2 protein. Chemical inhibition of the ERAD pathway neither affected production of the Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) nor stability of the JEV envelope protein. A co-immunoprecipitation assay showed that EDEM orthologs do not bind with JEV envelope protein. These findings highlight the crucial role of the ERAD pathway in the life cycle of specific viruses.","Saeed, Mohsan; Suzuki, Ryosuke; Watanabe, Noriyuki; Masaki, Takahiro; Tomonaga, Mitsunori; Muhammad, Amir; Kato, Takanobu; Matsuura, Yoshiharu; Watanabe, Haruo; Wakita, Takaji; Suzuki, Tetsuro",The Journal of biological chemistry,368,1

Here, we studied brain glucose metabolism in 22 morbidly obese patients before and 6 months after bariatric surgery. Seven healthy subjects served as control subjects. Brain glucose metabolism was measured twice per imaging session: with and without insulin stimulation (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp) using [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose scanning. We found that during fasting, brain glucose metabolism was not different between groups. However, the hyperinsulinemic clamp increased brain glucose metabolism in a widespread manner in the obese but not control subjects, and brain glucose metabolism was significantly higher during clamp in obese than in control subjects. After follow-up, 6 months postoperatively, the increase in glucose metabolism was no longer observed, and this attenuation was coupled with improved peripheral insulin sensitivity after weight loss. We conclude that obesity is associated with increased insulin-stimulated glucose metabolism in the brain and that this abnormality can be reversed by bariatric surgery.","Tuulari, Jetro J; Karlsson, Henry K; Hirvonen, Jussi; Hannukainen, Jarna C; Bucci, Marco; Helmiö, Mika; Ovaska, Jari; Soinio, Minna; Salminen, Paulina; Savisto, Nina; Nummenmaa, Lauri; Nuutila, Pirjo",Diabetes,368,1

Significant changes have occurred in the lives of Russian students. The research objective is to study students' strategies of adaptation to the self-isolation caused by the need to prevent the spread of COVID-19. To achieve this purpose, an online survey of students was conducted, followed by a correlation analysis of the data. The survey involved 269 students aged 17-21. In self-isolating conditions, students prefer to use strategies aimed at self-change. Two groups of strategies are distinguished in the structure of students' adaptive behavior, between which there are positive correlations of average strength. The first group includes students' preferable behavior strategies (accommodating, self-change, and self-immersion). The second group consists of strategies that are not popular among students (environment changing, waiting, avoidance, and passive self-representation). Male students are more active in solving problems than female students. The research results expand the existing understanding of students' reactions to changes related to selfisolation. They can be useful to teachers, psychologists involved in assessing the social consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on students.","Sivrikova, N.; Chernikova, E.; Kharlanova, E.; Ptashko, T.; Perebejnos, A.; Ryabykh, I.",International Conference Sport and Healthy Lifestyle Culture in the Xxi Century,368,20

Obtaining feedback was essential for identifying the effectiveness of training and areas of improvement for future sessions and for the service of the trust. Methods: Training was delivered during the COVID-19 pandemic in July -September 2020. Anaesthetists, obstetricians, midwives, theatre nurses, clinical support staff and students were involved in managing a clinical scenario. Feedback was obtained post-simulation in a questionnaire adapted from the Joint Royal College of Physicians Training Board evaluation form.1 87 feedback forms were completed, which equates to 74.35% response rate. Results: Not all members were aware of trust MOH protocols nor how to access guidelines. On a five-point scale (very poor, poor, satisfactory, good and excellent), over 90% of staff thought the simulation training was ‘good’ or ‘excellent’ in the following categories: teaching environment (n = 84);learning objectives were met (n = 84);delivery of teaching was clear and effective (n = 79);candidates had learnt something today (n = 83);and the usefulness of the session (n = 83). Only 68 (78%) of staff knew how to access the local trust guidelines, however following this training 84 (97%) felt more confident in calling a MOH. General comments include greater appreciation of other team members’ roles, whilst developing better communication and team-working skills. Through general feedback and discussion we have also identified the staff members’ concerns which were not highlighted previously. We found due to recent changes in theatre facilities and staff role, O negative blood was no longer readily available within the theatre complex and required delivery from a separate hospital building (which would take around 15 min). This was investigated, only to find that the blood fridge was non- functional and had no direct internet connection (for remote site monitoring). These concerns were highlighted leading to (1) reinstatement of accessible and functionable fridge;(2) establishment of wired internet access for remote site monitoring of fridge temperature;(3) negotiation with biomedical scientists and transfusion practitioner to expand role in monitoring fridge by direct checks;and (4) training of local staff within the maternity department to monitor and maintain fridge conditions. Discussion: Having alleviated our staff concerns, improved their confidence and knowledge in managing a frequent obstetric complication as well as allowing better access to crucial blood products, we hope this reflects as an improvement in service provision by auditing in the future. We hope to replicate this activity over at our cross-site hospital with the intention of enhancing staff training, inter- departmental relationships and again identification of concerns which can be rectified to improve patient safety.","Man, R.; Munshi, S.",International Journal of Obstetric Anesthesia,368,1

The article analyzes the phenomenon of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the human rights and freedoms. It emphasizes that some information about the coronavirus infection was available several decades ago. At the same time, the specialists unfortunately weren't ready for the possible mutation of this virus, which has now exposed a large-scales threat to the population of the whole world. The purpose of the article is to identify the problems of the implementation of the citizens' rights and offer proposals for improving the Russian and Belarusian legislation and the practice of its implementation in the field of combating the coronavirus infection. The methodology. The authors take into account the practice of the European Court of Human Rights and the constitutional control bodies of Russia and foreign countries. They make a conclusion on the legitimacy and necessity of the taken restrictive measures. The article is based on the dialectical method, as well as at the logical, historical, systemic methods. Methods of analysis and synthesis were of particular importance. The authors have applied the functional method to research the main areas for ensuring a reasonable balance of private (individual) and public interests. The main results, scope of application. Modern constitutions, including the Russian and the Belarusian ones, contains the most important principles of the rule of law, enshrine human rights and freedoms as the highest value. Human rights and freedoms continue to be are at the epicenter of many disputes and discussions. The modern system of rights and freedoms is constantly developing;the legal status of a person receives new content as the human civilization develops and the paradigm of values changes. For example, we see how information technology and other advances affect the scope of rights and freedoms. Rights, freedoms and obligations are interconnected and interdependent. All groups of rights are currently in the field of view of international organizations. The problem of equality, the elimination of discrimination, the restoration of violated rights, the assessment of the limits of the state's invasion in human rights and freedoms continues to be relevant nowadays. The article focuses on the international and national standards for the possible restriction of rights and freedoms in order to protect the health of the population. The international law rules on human rights oblige states to take measures to protect health and provide medical assistance to those in need. Conclusions. One of the constant problems is the relationship between the rights of a particular person and the rights of other persons, group or society as a whole and the state. At the same time, the coronavirus pandemic forced the public authorities to determine the balance of the priority of human rights and freedoms or the protection of the life and health of citizens. The coronavirus pandemic is the factor that affects the content of the legal regulation of relations in the field of human rights and freedoms. The measures taken by the state affect the right to health protection, freedom of movement, the right to education, right to have sport activity, right to work, freedom of assembly and others. The article proposes to inform the population more fully about the measures taken by the state and society in this direction, about the wider use of information technologies, about the possible responsibility for non-compliance with the requirements for the use of personal protective equipment and the self-isolation regime.","Vasilevich, G.

However, controversial cardiac toxicity results obtained from clinical trials and epidemic studies suggest that the cardiotoxicity of these two drugs should be re-evaluated. In the present study, we aimed to assess the impact of a short course of AZM or HCQ + AZM combination treatment on ECG and cardiac function in healthy guinea pigs. Methods Thirty-two male guinea pigs were randomly divided into four groups: control; AZM; HCQ; and HCQ + AZM groups. At 3, 6, and 9 days after treatment, electrocardiograms (ECGs) and echocardiographic techniques were used to determine important ECG parameters and cardiac functional parameters of the left ventricle (including posterior wall thickness, end systolic/end diastolic volume, ejection fraction, and fractional shortening). Results Although AZM decreased the heart rates of guinea pigs on day 9 (under anesthetized conditions), HCQ + AZM decreased heart rates on days 3, 6, and 9. The corrected QT intervals of guinea pigs after AZM and HCQ + AZM treatments were significantly increased, compared with CON and HCQ treatment respectively, on days 3, 6, and 9. However, QRS complex durations were not significantly different between the groups. AZM significantly decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and left ventricular fraction shortening (LVFS) on days 3, 6, and 9, whereas HCQ + AZM only decreased LVEF and LVFS on day 9. Posterior wall thickness and of the left ventricle in the diastolic and systolic states were not significantly different between these groups. In addition, compared with CON, AZM and HCQ decreased the EDV. And, in comparison with HCQ treatment, HCQ + AZM treatment increased ESV on day 9. Conclusions According to our study, AZM significantly prolongs the QT interval and damages cardiac function. Moreover, HCQ + AZM treatment increased the risk of cardiac dysfunction compared with HCQ treatment.","Li, Xiang; Tan, Weijiang; Zheng, Shuang; Sun, Huan; Zhang, Xiaoshen; Li, Xiaohui; Chen, Honghua; Ren, Xuecong; He, Tianzhen; Zhu, Caiyi; Zhang, Yu; Yang, Feng Hua",bioRxiv,368,1

Among the many identified cellular interactors of SFV proteins, the enrichment of factors involved in translation and nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) was striking, reflecting the virus’ hijacking of the translation machinery and indicating viral countermeasures for escaping NMD by inhibiting NMD at later time points during the infectious cycle. In addition to observing a general inhibition of NMD about 4 hours post infection, we also demonstrate that transient expression of the SFV capsid protein is sufficient to inhibit NMD in cells, suggesting that the massive production of capsid protein during the SFV reproduction cycle is responsible for NMD inhibition.","Contu, Lara; Balistreri, Giuseppe; Domanski, Michal; Uldry, Anne-Christine; Mühlemann, Oliver",bioRxiv,368,16

The parameters for bonded interactions are derived by mapping the bonds and angles for 20 amino acids onto target distributions obtained from fully atomistic simulations in explicit solvent. A dual-basin potential is introduced for stabilizing backbone angles, to cover a wide spectrum of protein secondary structures. The backbone dihedral potential enables folding of the protein from an unfolded initial state to the folded native structure. The proposed force field is validated by evaluating structural properties of several model peptides and proteins including the SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptide, consisting of α-helices, β-sheets, loops and turns. Detailed comparisons with fully atomistic simulations are carried out to assess the ability of the proposed force field to stabilize the different secondary structures present in proteins. The compact conformations of the native states were evident from the radius of gyration as well as the high intensity peaks of the root mean square deviation histograms, which were found to lie below 0.4 nm. The Ramachandran-like energy landscape on the phase space of backbone angles (θ) and dihedrals (ϕ) effectively captured the conformational phase space of α-helices at ∼(ϕ = 50°, θ = 90°) and β-strands at ∼(ϕ = ±180°, θ = 90° − 120°). Furthermore, the residue-residue native contacts are also well reproduced by the proposed DPD model. The applicability of the model to multidomain complexes is assessed using lysozyme as well as a large α helical bacterial pore-forming toxin, cytolysin A. Our studies illustrate that the proposed force field is generic, and can potentially be extended for efficient in-silico investigations of membrane bound polypeptides and proteins using DPD simulations.","Vaiwala, Rakesh; Ayappa, K.

The emergence of SM activity around the ASCO annual meetings has dramatically increased over the past 5 years, with factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic further accelerating use of digital platforms. This growth in SM engagement within the oncology community has previously been presented by totaling the quantity of tweets within a given time frame. Here, we explore the impact of specific trends through impression data. Methods: To evaluate activity trends among certain oncology stakeholders, we utilized an SM analytics platform, Symplur, to conduct a content analysis around ASCO conferences (2016-2020) using hashtags (#ASCOyy) as the search criterion. We focused our analysis on trends in impressions, defined by the theoretical maximum number of Twitter users a given tweet could have directly reached in a follower's timeline. We gathered impressions data to quantitatively assess overall ASCO engagement and evaluate topics of interest, and to discover common ASCO themes and reach within specific stakeholder groups. Results: Our results show the largest increase in impressions was during #ASCO20, despite a plateauing effect seen in the actual number of tweets (Table). The cumulative number of impressions for #ASCO16 was 468.2 million compared with approximately 1.12 billion for #ASCO20. Differentiating this result from the number of tweets related to ASCO, there was stabilization in the absolute number from #ASCO17 onward. When compiling impressions by doctors and by patient advocates, a similar trend emerged, with the most impressions captured during #ASCO20 (Table). Conclusions:As SM use continues to expand in the oncology community, stakeholders have turned to their digital voice to express views and opinions. The impact of impressions versus absolute number of tweets will continue to grow with a stakeholder's follower count, thus building on the digital presence in oncology.","Morgan, G.; Choueiri, T.

We also use multivariate copulae in an attempt to capture various patterns of dependence structures. In doing so, we relax the joint normality assumption of the errors of the demand system and estimate the model without having to delete one equation as is usually the practice. We show that the Minflex Laurent copula-based demand system produces a higher income elasticity for credit card transaction services and higher Morishima elasticities between credit card transaction services and monetary assets compared to the traditional estimation of the Minflex Laurent demand system. We also show that credit cards are substitutes for monetary assets and that there is lower tail dependence between the demand for credit card transaction services and transaction balances. © The Author(s), 2021.

The number people affected by this virus are increasing exponentially day by day and the number has already crossed 6.4 million. As no vaccine has been discovered yet, the early detection of patients and isolation is the only and most effective way to reduce the spread of the virus. Detecting infected persons from chest X-Ray by using Deep Neural Networks, can be applied as a time and laborsaving solution. In this study, we tried to detect Covid-19 by classification of Covid-19, pneumonia and normal chest X-Rays. We used five different Convolutional Pre-Trained Neural Network models (VGG16, VGG19, Xception, InceptionV3 and Resnet50) and compared their performance. VGG16 and VGG19 shows precise performance in classification. Both models can classify between three kinds of X-Rays with an accuracy over 92%. Another part of our study was to find the impact of weather factors (temperature, humidity, sun hour and wind speed) on this pandemic using Decision Tree Regressor. We found that temperature, humidity and sun-hour jointly hold 85.88% impact on escalation of Covid-19 and 91.89% impact on death due to Covid-19 where humidity has 8.09% impact on death. We also tried to predict the death of an individual based on age, gender, country, and location due to COVID-19 using the LogisticRegression, which can predict death of an individual with a model accuracy of 94.40%.","Haque, A K M Bahalul; Pranto, Tahmid Hasan; Noman, Abdulla All; Mahmood, Atik",,368,33

Spiritual leadership as a new genre has been acknowledged as an important influencing factor in employees’ innovation across various industries. However, there is a lack of research linking spiritual leadership, workplace spirituality and innovation in highly stressful mining industries, specifically within a newly developed country like Indonesia. Therefore, during crisis time, it would be interesting to test the indirect effect of spiritual leadership on followers’ innovative work behaviour as mediated through followers’ perception of workplace spirituality. The current study is set to serve two purposes. The first purpose clears the confusion regarding the findings related to spiritual leadership’s influence on employee’s innovative work behaviour. The second purpose investigates the mediating role of workplace spirituality in explaining the relationship between spiritual leadership and innovative work behaviour. Employing structural equation modelling (SEM) on samples of 217 employees of mining companies in South Kalimantan, Indonesia, the results have revealed a positive and significant relationship between spiritual leadership and innovative work behaviour. These relationships were mediated by workplace spirituality. Within the specific milieu of respondents who consider that life is preordained and people cannot conquer nature, the management must enhance the workplace spirituality to keep employees remain innovative besides moulding inner motivation created through spiritual leadership. © 2021, Czestochowa University of Technology.

Primary care has transformed dramatically with much care being provided remotely. The COVID surges and vaccination programme have reduced capacity further. People with conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease and diabetes depend on regular review and treatment optimisation to keep them well. There is a high risk that continued disruption to proactive care will drive an increase in exacerbations and complications. It is likely this will drive further waves of demand for urgent care over the coming months in primary care, in emergency departments and in hospital admissions. Methods The team of GPs & pharmacists at UCLPartners, with patient and public support, developed proactive care frameworks for six conditions including atrial fibrillation, hypertension, high cholesterol and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The frameworks focus on the 'how to' of delivering care in the new world of primary care post COVID-19. They are built on 4 principles: virtual where appropriate, use of the wider workforce, step change in self-management, and use of digital resources. For each condition, the frameworks include: risk stratification tools;pathways that support remote care and deploy staff such as healthcare assistants and social prescribers to systematically support education, self-management and lifestyle change;scripts, protocols and training to guide these staff in consultations;digital tools;and resources to support treatment optimisation. The frameworks include clinical and project management support for local pathway adaptation and implementation. Results The frameworks have gained wide traction in primary care across England. There have been over 2,700 downloads of the search/stratification tools with evidence of implementation in several regions. In the UCLP geography, North East London and North Central London have adopted the frameworks for roll out across 475 GP practices and 2.8 million people. NHSEngland has now adopted the Frameworks as a key part of the NHS@Home programme with plans to support at scale national roll out. Evaluation is being commissioned. Conclusions The UCLPartners Proactive Care Frameworks provide systematic, evidence-based support to restore services post COVID: stratifying so that higher risk patients can be prioritised and workload managed;maximising remote care;optimising personalisation and support for self-care. By using a population health management approach together with comprehensive resources to support clinical management in real world primary care, the frameworks provide a platform not just to restore services but to optimise treatment and outcomes in the high-risk conditions for CVD. The widespread national traction the frameworks are gaining suggests that despite the pandemic, this brings an opportunity to deliver the NHS Long Term Plan ambitions for CVD prevention and prevent 150,000 heart attacks, strokes and cases of dementia.","Kearney, M.; Shah, D.; Peate, S.; Robson, J.; Williams, H.; Antoniou, S.; Butt, M.; Saleemi, A.; Amevenu, D.; Hameed, N.; Khanji, M.; McErlean, M.; Boyd, L.",Heart,368,16

We review all patients with COVID 19 disease admitted in our trust requiring transthoracic echocardiograms on their clinical indications. Background Cardiac involvement in COVID-19 disease has been found to be prognostic factor and has been related with higher mortality and morbidity. In a large series with COVID-19 those with heart disease had a fatality rate around 10.5%.1 2 Methods All adult patients who were COVID-19 positive on PCR admitted between March 2020 and February 2021, who had an echocardiogram, were identified through our local database. Their demographics, co-morbid, troponin levels and Pro NT-BNP were analysed. All echocardiograms reports which were finalised by the imaging cardiologist were included in our analysis. Results There were a total of 41 patients who had echocardiograms during their stay in the hospital with COVID-19 disease. Mean age was 70 (range 45-90) years old. There were 70% male and 30% female patients. 12% were diabetic, 49% hypertensive and 40% had previous heart disease. Pulmonary embolism diagnosed in 10% of patients by CT pulmonary angiogram. 56% of patients required high flow oxygen and 21% need mechanical ventilation. Almost all patients had troponin and CRP levels on admission. Mean troponin level 215 and mean CRP levels were 197. Mean D dimer levels 1130, and mean creatinine levels were 138. 92% had evidence of lung involvement in chest X-ray. 13% patients had new evidence of a diagnosis of left ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography. Similarly, 27% had a new diagnosis of right ventricular dysfunction. Mean left ventricular diastolic dimension were 4.6 cm and systolic dimension. 2% had echo diagnosis of left ventricular thrombus echocardiographic studies. Mean PA pressure on echocardiography were 35 mmHg and mean E/A ratio was 1.2. 17% of patients were found to have pericardial effusion but none causing haemodynamic compromise. Conclusion This data suggests high incidence of right and left ventricular involvement in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. We recommend that all patients with COVID-19 disease admitted to hospital and requiring oxygen should have transthoracic echocardiograms during their admission.","Ahmed, M.

We interpret these as most likely the orbital periods of different debris clumps. Changes in the detailed dip structures within the light curves are observed on nightly, weekly, and monthly timescales, reminiscent of the dynamic behavior observed in the first white dwarf discovered to harbor a disintegrating asteroid, WD 1145+017.

The value added is much beyond the money it can save people's life, with the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic the benefits derived from IoT enabled technology has been remarkable. A striking feature of IoT enabled tools in the field of health care sector is thait can cater to a large population simultaneously and remotely. If IoT platform is implemented in healthcare services it can reduce the expenditure of health care services to the national GDP and can reduce the mortality rate.

For many, the special circumstances brought by the Covid-19 pandemic and related counter measures led to required transformations in incumbent practices. While all sectors were impacted during 2020, manufacturing industries experienced unique challenges due to supply shortages and shutdowns of production plants. This research focuses in studying the external communications of manufacturing companies. Social media platforms have emerged as channels for company communications, and Twitter as a focal one for less than formal communication. Companies’ activity on this platform during challenging times arises as meaningful for identifying latent signals on the developments in industries. Hence, Twitter activity of 18 most traded Finnish manufacturing companies in Helsinki Stock Exchange during 2020 is studied. In total, 4 915 tweets and their contents were analyzed. Frequently used words and n-grams are reflected with the financial performance of said companies and developments of Covid-19 pandemic during that year. The overall activity is observed to somewhat correlate with the recorded Covid-19 infections, however, number of tweets was lower than in 2019. Also, activity seems to follow official statements and set preventing measures concerning the virus. Content analysis of tweets reveals that Covid-19 was frequent topic in the studied companies’ external communications. In addition, need to organize non-conventional stakeholder events emerge from the companies’ communications. However, mostly the content seems to focus on long-time strategies of the studied companies, e.g., business renewal and efforts to increase sustainability. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Lähdeaho, O.; Hilmola, O.

Traditional vaccines based on killed and attenuated organisms and inactivated toxins have constituted the majority of clinically used vaccines to date, but novel vaccines based on subunits of these organisms will be increasingly represented in future. In contrast to attenuated and whole cell vaccines, subunit vaccines do not generally contain immune-stimulatory components and are poorly immunogenic. As a result, new, potent and safe adjuvants and delivery systems are needed to enhance the immunogenicity of these vaccines. Furthermore, there is a drive to replace injected vaccines with those that can be administered by mucosal routes. Since the induction of innate immunity is crucial for vaccines to elicit potent antigen specific immune responses, a greater understanding of innate immunity at mucosal surfaces and the mechanism of action of adjuvants and delivery systems is required.","Lavelle, E C",Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,368,1

This model underlies a concept that demyelinating diseases are caused by viruses producing immunopathologic responses realized via certain histocompatibility loci.

To assess the role of this leucine zipper domain in S-induced cell-to-cell fusion, the six heptadic leucine and isoleucine residues were replaced with alanine by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant S proteins were analyzed for cell-to-cell membrane fusion activity as well as for progress through the glycoprotein maturation process, including intracellular glycosylation, oligomerization, and cell surface expression. Single-alanine-substitution mutations had minimal, if any, effects on S-induced cell-to-cell fusion. Significant reduction in fusion activity was observed, however, when two of the four middle heptadic leucine or isoleucine residues were replaced with alanine. Double alanine substitutions that involved either of the two end heptadic leucine residues did not significantly affect fusion. All double-substitution mutant S proteins displayed levels of endoglycosidase H resistance and cell surface expression similar to those of the wild-type S. However, fusion-defective double-alanine-substitution mutants exhibited defects in S oligomerization. These results indicate that the leucine zipper domain plays a role in S-induced cell-to-cell fusion and that the ability of S to induce fusion may be dependent on the oligomeric structure of S.","Luo, Z; Matthews, A M; Weiss, S R",Journal of virology,368,1

The patients underwent partial small-bowel resections and either handsewn or stapled anastomoses for the ileostomy closures. They were followed up postoperatively with routine surgical examinations. RESULTS The study group consisted of 124 men and 101 women with a mean age of 49.12 years. The ileostomy closure was performed with handsewn in 129 patients and with stapled in 96 patients. The mean time to the first postoperative flatus was 2.426 days in the handsewn group and 2.052 days in the stapled group (p <0.05). The mean time to the first postoperative defecation was 3.202 days in the handsewn group and 2.667 days in the stapled group (p <0.05). The mean duration of patient hospital stay was 8.581 days for the handsewn group and 6.063 days for the stapled group (p <0.05). CONCLUSIONS Patients who underwent ileostomy closure with stapled recovered faster in the postoperative period and required shorter hospital stays than those whose closures were performed with handsewn. In our opinion, stapled should be considered the gold standard for loop ileostomy closures.","Balik, Emre; Eren, Tunc; Bugra, Dursun; Buyukuncu, Yilmaz; Akyuz, Ali; Yamaner, Sumer",Clinics,368,16

Here, we show that the CoV replicative machinery, unlike that of other RNA viruses, also uses an exoribonuclease (ExoN) activity, which is associated with nonstructural protein (nsp) 14. Bacterially expressed forms of SARS-CoV nsp14 were shown to act on both ssRNAs and dsRNAs in a 3'-->5' direction. The activity depended on residues that are conserved in the DEDD exonuclease superfamily. The protein did not hydrolyze DNA or ribose-2'-O-methylated RNA substrates and required divalent metal ions for activity. A range of 5'-labeled ssRNA substrates were processed to final products of approximately 8-12 nucleotides. When part of dsRNA or in the presence of nonlabeled dsRNA, the 5'-labeled RNA substrates were processed to significantly smaller products, indicating that binding to dsRNA in cis or trans modulates the exonucleolytic activity of nsp14. Characterization of human CoV 229E ExoN active-site mutants revealed severe defects in viral RNA synthesis, and no viable virus could be recovered. Besides strongly reduced genome replication, specific defects in sg RNA synthesis, such as aberrant sizes of specific sg RNAs and changes in the molar ratios between individual sg RNA species, were observed. Taken together, the study identifies an RNA virus ExoN activity that is involved in the synthesis of multiple RNAs from the exceptionally large genomic RNA templates of CoVs.","Minskaia, Ekaterina; Hertzig, Tobias; Gorbalenya, Alexander E; Campanacci, Valérie; Cambillau, Christian; Canard, Bruno; Ziebuhr, John",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,368,1

The chimeric genes were cloned into plasmid pGEX-6p-1 and expressed in E. coli with IPGT inducing. BALB/c mice were immunized with the purified recombinant fusion protein. The specificity of monoclonal antibodies were tested with a commercial ELISA kit for detecting antibody against SARS-CoV. The results showed that two peptides with molecular weights of 34kD and 35kD expressed by the two chimeric genes could be recognized by SARS patient convalescent serum in Western blot. Six positive hybridoma cell lines stably secreting monoclonal antibodies were selected. The subtype of monoclonal antibody D3C5 is IgG2a, and subtypes of all other five monoclonal antibodies are IgG1. Light chains of all monoclonal antibodies are kappa. With a commercial SARS-CoV antibodies detection ELISA kit, five out of six monoclonal antibodies were positively recognized. In western blot analysis with inactived virus cultures, D3D1 specifically recognized a band of about 180 kD. To further analyse the epitopes corresponding to the monoclonal antibodies, six oligoes (S1-S6) from S gene were synthesized and expressed. The results showed that the monoclonal antibodies D3D1 and D3C5 specifically recognized expression product of S2 and S5 oligoes, respectively. The S2 and S5 oligoes are corresponding to 447-458aa and 789-799aa of SARS-CoV S protein respectively.","Zhou, Yan-Jun; Hua, Rong-Hong; Wang, Yun-Feng; An, Tong-Qing; Liu, Jin-Xia; Yang, Jin-Yu; Hua, Yu-Zhuo; Tong, Guang-Zhi",Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology,368,16

It is a highly mutable virus consisting of numerous antigenically distinct serotypes with different pathology. These can be divided according to their tissue tropism into respiratory and enterotropic strains. The course of an MHV infection is dependent on virus strain and host factors. Generally MHV causes an acute, self limiting infection which is inapparent in adult mice. Neonates are highly susceptible to disease and show high mortality. In an enzootically infected colony however, they are protected by maternally derived passive immunity. MHV's importance in biomedical research on one hand stems from its potential as an interfering agent, mainly in the field of immunology. On the other hand MHV serves as a model for coronaviruses of other species including man in studies on virus replication and tissue tropism. Since MHV infections are usually subclinical, detection depends on serological screening of colonies using Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) or immunofluorescence. MHV is controlled by culling and rederivation of the affected colony using hysterectomy or embryo transfer or by elimination by cessation of breeding.","Homberger, F R",Schweizer Archiv fur Tierheilkunde,368,26

For coronaviruses, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is an important polymerase that catalyzes the replication of RNA from RNA template and is an attractive therapeutic target. In this study, we screened these chemical structures from traditional Chinese medicinal compounds proven to show antiviral activity in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the similar chemical structures through a molecular docking study to target RdRp of SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV, and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). We found that theaflavin has a lower idock score in the catalytic pocket of RdRp in SARS-CoV-2 (-9.11 kcal/mol), SARS-CoV (-8.03 kcal/mol), and MERS-CoV (-8.26 kcal/mol) from idock. To confirm the result, we discovered that theaflavin has lower binding energy of -8.8 kcal/mol when it docks in the catalytic pocket of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by using the Blind Docking server. Regarding contact modes, hydrophobic interactions contribute significantly in binding and additional hydrogen bonds were found between theaflavin and RdRp. Moreover, one &#960;-cation interaction was formed between theaflavin and Arg553 from the Blind Docking server.

There are various subtypes of coronavirus, 7 out of these can cause infection in human beings. The Alpha subtype is responsible for mild infection showing symptoms or infection without any prevailing symptoms. On the other hand, the beta subtype is responsible for very serious diseases leading to fatality. The lineage of this novel SARS-CoV-2 falls under the beta lineage of the beta coronavirus which has been observed to have a relation to the MERS and SARS coronavirus.

In general, there is no local team with enough experts with the required different skills capable of analyzing them in entirety. The integration of those abilities usually demands a relatively long-period and is cost. Considering that scenario, this paper proposes a new Feature Sensitivity technique that can automatically deal with a large dataset. It uses a criterion-based sampling strategy from the Optimization based on Phylogram Analysis. Called FS-opa, the new approach seems proper for dealing with any types of raw data from health centers and manipulate their entire datasets. Besides, FS-opa can find the principal features for the construction of inference models without depending on expert knowledge of the problem domain. The selected features can be combined with usual statistical or machine learning methods to perform predictions. The new method can mine entire datasets from scratch. FS-opa was evaluated using a relatively large dataset from electronic health records of mental disorder prehospital services in Brazil. Cox's approach was integrated to FS-opa to generate survival analysis models related to the length of stay (LOS) in hospitals, assuming that it is a relevant aspect that can benefit estimates of the efficiency of hospitals and the quality of patient treatments. Since FS-opa can work with raw datasets, no knowledge from the problem domain was used to obtain the preliminary prediction models found. Results show that FS-opa succeeded in performing a feature sensitivity analysis using only the raw data available. In this way, FS-opa can find the principal features without bias of an inference model, since the proposed method does not use it. Moreover, the experiments show that FS-opa can provide models with a useful trade-off according to their representativeness and parsimony. It can benefit further analyses by experts since they can focus on aspects that benefit problem modeling.","Gholi Zadeh Kharrat, Fatemeh; Shydeo Brandão Miyoshi, Newton; Cobre, Juliana; Mazzoncini De Azevedo-Marques, João; Mazzoncini de Azevedo-Marques, Paulo; Cláudio Botazzo Delbem, Alexandre",PLoS One,368,22

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, some clinicians might have opted for less potent immunosuppressive agents to counterbalance the novel infectious risk. We conducted a nationwide study to characterize immunosuppression use and subsequent clinical outcomes during the first 5 months of COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. METHODS: Using data from the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients, we studied all kidney-only recipients in the United States from January 1, 2017, to March 12, 2020 (""prepandemic"" era; n = 64 849) and from March 13, 2020, to July 31, 2020 (""pandemic"" era; n = 5035). We compared the use of lymphocyte-depleting agents (versus basiliximab or no induction) and maintenance steroids (versus steroid avoidance/withdrawal) in the pandemic era compared with the prepandemic era. Then, we compared early posttransplant outcomes by immunosuppression regimen during the pandemic era. RESULTS: Recipients in the pandemic era were substantially less likely to receive lymphocyte-depleting induction agents compared with their prepandemic counterparts (aOR = 0.400.530.69); similar trends were found across subgroups of state-level COVID-19 incidence, donor type, and recipient age. However, lymphocyte-depleting induction agents were associated with decreased rejection during admission (aOR = 0.110.230.47) but not with increased mortality in the pandemic era (aHR = 0.130.471.66). On the other hand, the use of maintenance steroids versus early steroid withdrawal remained similar (aOR = 0.711.071.62). CONCLUSIONS: The use of lymphocyte-depleting induction agents has decreased in favor of basiliximab and no induction during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this shift might have resulted in increases in rejection with no clear reductions in posttransplant mortality.","Bae, Sunjae; McAdams-DeMarco, Mara A; Massie, Allan B; Ahn, JiYoon B; Werbel, William A; Brennan, Daniel C; Lentine, Krista L; Durand, Christine M; Segev, Dorry L",Transplantation,368,14

The search was limited to the studies that reported the data on the number of COVID-19 positive healthcare workers, among the COVID-19 positive patients. Case reports, duplicate publications, reviews, and family-based studies were excluded. The methodological quality of studies was assessed by the Appraisal tool for Cross-Sectional Studies (AXIS) tool. RESULTS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we pooled eleven studies to investigate the above factors. The overall proportion of HCW who were SARS-CoV-2 positive among all COVID-19 patients was 10.1% (95%CI: 5.3-14.9).

This included working from home (WHF) wherever possible. Many experts from the IT industry were long arguing about the potential for WFH, which suddenly now became indisputable. The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of WFH on the individuals' perception about their future financial situation and their mental well-being. We apply a difference-in-differences (DiD) framework using data from the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS) combined with the UKHLS COVID-19 survey conducted in April 2020. Our findings suggest that those who have not experienced a shift from working at the employer's premises to WFH became more concerned about their future financial situation. However, we find that WFH has a negative impact on mental well-being. On the other hand, we find no difference in the mental well-being when we consider those who work from home on occasion. The findings of this study have policy implications for government, firms and health practitioners. In particular, a balance between WFH and at the employer's premises may provide both financial security and maintain the mental and psychological well-being at satisfying levels.","Giovanis, Eleftherios; Ozdamar, Oznur",Int. j. health policy manag,368,16

We aim to investigate the impact of the pandemic on psychiatric services and the severity of presentations in Edinburgh, with a particular focus on the North-West Edinburgh Community Mental Health Team (NW CMHT).MethodMeasures of the impact of the pandemic on NW CMHT were identified as referral numbers from primary care and Did Not Attend (DNA) rates. Royal Edinburgh Hospital admissions, detentions under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 (MHA) and Out of Hours (OOH) contacts were used as proxy measures to explore the severity and urgency of presentations.Quantitative data focussing on these parameters for patients aged 18–65 years in NW CMHT in 2019 and 2020 were collected from NHS Lothian Analytical Services. OOH data were only available Edinburgh-wide. All data were anonymised in line with NHS Lothian Information Governance Policy.In order to assess the impact on staff, a questionnaire was created and disseminated, with qualitative data returned anonymously.ResultReferrals to NW CMHT decreased by 9.3% in 2020 (n = 2164) compared to 2019 (n = 2366). Referrals in April (n = 81) and May (n = 102) 2020 were far below the monthly average across the two years (n = 188).Appointment numbers were very similar in 2019 (n = 3542) and 2020 (n = 3514). Despite this, DNA and cancellation rates decreased by 3.94% in 2020. Questionnaire results illustrated some of the challenges for staff of working during a pandemic.Admissions to hospital reduced by 6.8% in 2020 (n = 219 vs n = 235). While MHA detentions in NW Edinburgh increased by only 1.8% (n = 173 vs n = 170), new Compulsory Treatment Orders (CTO) increased by 60%. Furthermore, OOH contacts across Edinburgh increased by 45.2% when compared to 2019.ConclusionThe COVID-19 pandemic altered the way patients accessed healthcare. Uncertainty of the public in accessing primary care services early in the pandemic may have contributed to reduced referral numbers.The increase in CTOs is suggestive of severe relapses in previously stable patients or new episodes of illness. The pandemic may have contributed to a reduction in early recognition, and referral, of those with major mental disorders resulting in more protracted or severe illness episodes. The increase in OOH crisis contacts supports such a hypothesis.Despite what would be expected, DNA and cancellation rates in NW CMHT reduced. The contribution of telemedicine to this warrants further exploration as a means of delivering healthcare in an efficient and accessible way.","Devadas, Ritika Murdie Douglas Idris Thomas Hannah Rhona Karbowniczek Wiktoria Kinney Tara Lacey-Solymar Oscar Łukaszuk Adam MacDonald Seona McIntosh Sarah Taha Danya Taylor Charles",BJPsych Open,368,27

IgG products from plasma obtained from Germany, Czech Republic, Slovak Republic, USA and Spain were tested for antibodies to four common HCoV: 229E, OC43, NL63 and HKU1. Since these products are manufactured from pooled plasma from thousands of donors, the antibodies therein are a representation of the HCoV exposure of the population at large. MethodsIgG products of different concentrations manufactured from geographically diverse plasma pools were tested for antibodies to four common HCoV by ELISA. In addition, neutralization assays were conducted using HCoV-229E expressed in MRC5 cells. Complete concentration-neutralization curves were obtained to calculate potencies. ResultsThe ELISA assays showed that when expressed as specific activity (anti-HCoV activity/mg IgG) similar activity against the four common HCoV was seen across the IgG products regardless of concentration or geographic origin. Highest anti-HCoV activity was seen against HCoV-229E, followed by HCoV-OC43 and then HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1. The neutralization assays showed similar potency for two preparations of IgG prepared by different processes. ConclusionsThese studies are the first demonstration of antibodies to common HCoV in IgG products. The level of activity was similar regardless of the geographic origin of the plasma pool. These antibodies demonstrated neutralization activity against HCoV-229E in MRC5 cells. These results may explain the cross-reactivity seen with pre-pandemic IgG products and SARS-CoV-2 and contribute to the variability in disease course in different patients.","Díez, José-María; Romero, Carolina; Gajardo, Rodrigo",,368,16

In addition, tracheal compression by thyroid nodules can aggravate hypoxia in critically ill patients. No studies have investigated the effect of thyroid nodules on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. In this study, we investigated the effect of thyroid hormonal disorders and thyroid nodules on the prognosis of patients with COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at the Sirnak State Hospital (Pandemic hospital in Turkey) between 15 March and 15 August 2020. We evaluated thyroid hormonal disorder and thyroid nodules in 125 patients who were admitted to the non-intensive care unit (non-ICU) due to mild COVID-19 pneumonia (group 1) and 125 critically ill patients who were admitted to the ICU (group 2). RESULTS: Thyroid-stimulating hormone levels (TSH) were not significantly different between groups 1 and 2; however, group 2 patients had significantly lower levels of free thyroxine (FT4) and free triiodothyronine (FT3) as compared to group 1 (P = .005, P < .0001, respectively). FT3 level showed a negative correlation with length of hospital stay and C-reactive protein level (rho: -0.216, p: 0.001; rho: -0.383, P < .0001). Overt thyroid disorder was observed in 13 patients [2 patients in group 1 (both with overt thyrotoxicosis) and 11 patients in group 2 (3 overt hypothyroidism, 8 overt thyrotoxicosis) (P = .01)]. Thyroid nodules sized &#8805;1 cm were found in 9 patients (7%) in group 1 and 32 patients (26%) in group 2 (P < .0001). CONCLUSION: Overt thyroid hormonal disorders were more common in critically ill COVID-19 patients. FT3 level at hospital admission is a potential prognostic marker of COVID-19 patients. Thyroid nodules may be associated with severe COVID-19 disease.","Güven, Mehmet; Gültekin, Hamza",Int J Clin Pract,368,17

The signaling process initiates with the detection of endogenous and/or external danger signals by specific sensors, followed by the nucleation and polymerization from sensor to downstream adaptor and then to the effector, caspase-1. Aberrant activation of inflammasomes promotes autoinflammatory diseases, cancer, neurodegeneration, and cardiometabolic disorders. Therefore, an equitable level of regulation is required to maintain the equilibrium between inflammasome activation and inhibition. Recent advancement in the structural and mechanistic understanding of inflammasome assembly potentiates the emergence of novel therapeutics against inflammasome-regulated diseases.

We argue that sentiment analysis is well suited to study an important topic in digital sociology: affective publics. Specifically, sentiment analysis reveals useful to explore two key components of affective publics: a) structure (emergence of dominant emotions);b) dynamics (transformation of affectivity into emotions). To do that we suggest combining sentiment analysis with emotion detection, text analysis and social media engagement metrics – which help to better understand the semantic and social context in which the sentiment related to a specific issue is situated. To illustrate our methodological point, we draw on the analysis of 33,338 tweets containing two hashtags – #NHSHeroes and #Covidiot – emerged in response to the global pandemic caused by Covid-19. Drawing on the analysis of the two affective publics aggregating around #NHSHeroes and #Covidiot, we conclude that they reflect a blend of emotions. In some cases, such generic flow of affect coalesces into a dominant emotion while it may not necessarily occur in other instances. Affective publics structured around positive emotions and local issues tend to be more consistent and cohesive than those based on general issues and negative emotions. Although negative emotions might attract the attention of digital publics, positively framed messages engage users more. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Rathnayake, C.; Caliandro, A.",Lect.

SUMMARY: IV room TAWFs help to standardize intravenous admixture operations while incorporating patient safety measures such as ingredient barcode scanning and image capture. The 4 oncology infusion center pharmacies of a large health system implemented a TAWF system integrated within the health system's EMR software, transitioning to the new TAWF system from an external TAWF system operating outside of the EMR. Considerable planning was required to determine the hardware and workflow processes needed for the new integrated TAWF system to function within pharmacy IV rooms. Several operational challenges were encountered during the initial implementation phase of the project. Frequent occurrence of system malfunctions during the product imaging step was the largest problem, which was overcome by special hardware and a software upgrade. The project also involved an evaluation of the integrated TAWF system after implementation to ensure the pharmacies maintained operational efficiency and patient safety. The evaluation showed that after an initial transition period, the new technology was able to maintain IV admixture efficiency and safety. CONCLUSION: This project and subsequent evaluation showed the operational feasibility, efficiency, and safety of a TAWF integrated within the health system's EMR software.","Flanagin, Connor M; Little, Jeff; Brookins, Leslie; Wills, Meredith",Am J Health Syst Pharm,368,16

Multidepartment data analysis will reflect the pandemic’s impact and challenges in managing surgical cases in various surgery departments. AIM: This study aims to assess the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on surgical cases carried out in eight tertiary care center surgery departments. METHODS: Retrospective data from all patients in the eight surgery departments of Dr. Moewardi General Hospital, Surakarta, during the lockdown period due to COVID-19 were collected and compared to the period before the lockdown. Then, the data were analyzed regarding the effects of following the standard operating procedure for surgical services in the hospital during the lockdown period. RESULTS: All the surgery departments involved in the study showed a significant reduction in the number of patients treated during the lockdown period than before the lockdown, with a total number of cases across all departments of 2432, a decrease from 4503 before the lockdown. In surgical patient care, several special measures during the COVID-19 pandemic were carried out in outpatient, intraoperative, and inpatient services to reduce the virus spread to patients and health workers. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected the provision of health services in hospitals with a reduction in the number and types of patients in each surgery department, and the obligation to follow hospital protocols against COVID-19 has resulted in various treatments and services being delayed in all surgery departments.","Putra, M.

However, there is no comprehensive review of safety data reported from the vaccine trials, which is critical information to inform the policies in order to improve uptake of COVID-19 vaccines and mitigate the risk aversion perceived due to the COVID-vaccine side effects. This study aims to systematically review and synthesize the evidence on the safety data from the published COVID-19 vaccine trials. This study followed PRISMA guidelines. We searched three major electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, and Google Scholar) for published studies between Dec 2019 and 2020. Eligible study designs were randomized trials and pre-and post-intervention evaluations. Descriptive findings of included studies were reported stratified by target population, setting, outcomes, and overall results. From PubMed, Embase, WHO database, and Google Scholar screened titles and abstracts, 11 studies were identified in this review. Most of the reactions reported were mild to moderate whereas a few with severe intensity. All reactions resolved within 3-4 days. The commonly reported local adverse events were pain at the site of injection, swelling, and redness. The systemic reactions included fever, fatigue, myalgia, and headache. Some trials also reported laboratory derangements like decreased hemoglobin, increased bilirubin, altered SGOT and SGPT. None of these alterations were clinically manifested and were self-limiting. Few clinical trials reported serious adverse events, but they were unrelated to vaccination. This systematic review indicates that COVID-19 vaccines can be safe with no serious adverse events. However, long-term post-marketing surveillance data, particularly in high-risk vulnerable populations (elderly and those with co-morbidities, pregnant women, and children) is warranted to ensure the safety of COVID-19 vaccines.","Kaur, Rimple Jeet; Dutta, Siddhartha; Bhardwaj, Pankaj; Charan, Jaykaran; Dhingra, Sameer; Mitra, Prasenjit; Singh, Kavita; Yadav, Dharmveer; Sharma, Praveen; Misra, Sanjeev",Indian J Clin Biochem,368,33

During the first 2 years after adolescents with chronic conditions are transferred to adult hospitals, non-adherence rates approach 70% and emergency visits and hospitalisation rates significantly increase. The purpose of the Bridge study is to prospectively examine associations of transition readiness and care experiences with transition success: young patients' health, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and adherence to medical appointments as well as costs of care. In addition, we will track patients' growing independence and educational and employment pathways during the transition process. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Bridge is an international, prospective, observational cohort study. Study participants are adolescents with a chronic health condition or disability and their parents/guardians who attended the New Children's Hospital in Helsinki, Finland, or the Royal Children's Hospital (RCH) in Melbourne, Australia. Baseline assessment took place approximately 6 months prior to the transfer of care and follow-up data will be collected 1 year and 2 years after the transfer of care. Data will be collected from patients' hospital records and from questionnaires completed by the patient and their parent/guardian at each time point. The primary outcomes of this study are adherence to medical appointments, clinical health status and HRQoL and costs of care. Secondary outcome measures are educational and employment outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The Ethics Committee for Women's and Children's Health and Psychiatry at the Helsinki University Hospital (HUS/1547/2017) and the RCH Human Research Ethics Committee (38035) have approved the Bridge study protocol.

This renders the goal of active immunization of the population through vaccination a worldwide public health priority. In fact, only when efficient vaccination programs will be successfully implemented, a return to pre-pandemic normality can be considered. The scientific community has made a tremendous effort to blow the lid off the pathogenesis of the disease, and unprecedented efforts are ongoing with governments, private organizations, and academics working together to expeditiously develop safe and efficacious vaccines. Previous research efforts in the development of vaccines for other coronaviruses (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 1 and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus) as well other emerging viruses have opened the door for exploiting several strategies to design a new vaccine against the pandemic virus. Indeed, in a few months, a stunning number of vaccines have been proposed, and almost 50 putative vaccine candidates have entered clinical trials. The different vaccine candidates use different vaccine development platforms, from inactivated whole virus vaccine to subunit vaccine, nucleic acid, and vectored vaccines.

Although, there are currently no specific drugs approved, several existing drugs are being repurposed, but their successful outcomes are not guaranteed. Therefore, the search for novel therapeutics remains a priority. We screened for inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease and the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein from an integrated library of African natural products, compounds generated from machine learning studies and antiviral drugs using AutoDock Vina. The binding mechanisms between the compounds and the proteins were characterized using LigPlot+ and molecular dynamics simulations techniques. The biological activities of the hit compounds were also predicted using a Bayesian-based approach. Six potential bioactive molecules NANPDB2245, NANPDB2403, fusidic acid, ZINC000095486008, ZINC0000556656943 and ZINC001645993538 were identified, all of which had plausible binding mechanisms with both viral receptors. Molecular dynamics simulations, including molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA) computations revealed stable protein-ligand complexes with all the compounds having acceptable free binding energies <-15 kJ/mol with each receptor. NANPDB2245, NANPDB2403 and ZINC000095486008 were predicted as antivirals; ZINC000095486008 as a membrane permeability inhibitor; NANPDB2403 as a cell adhesion inhibitor and RNA-directed RNA polymerase inhibitor; and NANPDB2245 as a membrane integrity antagonist. Therefore, they have the potential to inhibit viral entry and replication. These drug-like molecules were predicted to possess attractive pharmacological profiles with negligible toxicity. Novel critical residues identified for both targets could aid in a better understanding of the binding mechanisms and design of fragment-based de novo inhibitors. The compounds are proposed as worthy of further in vitro assaying and as scaffolds for the development of novel SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic molecules.","Kwofie, Samuel K; Broni, Emmanuel; Asiedu, Seth O; Kwarko, Gabriel B; Dankwa, Bismark; Enninful, Kweku S; Tiburu, Elvis K; Wilson, Michael D",Molecules (Basel),368,9

In collaboration with 43 community health workers (CHWs) and Promotor/as serving the needs of underserved Latinx communities in South Texas and guided by principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR), the purpose of this study was to identify relevant mental health stressors and related consequences, and to identify strategies for coping with distress among underserved Latinx communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected on July 2020 using mixed methods to obtain more in-depth information. Surveys were administered, and three focus groups were conducted. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics, whereas qualitative data were analysed systematically by starting with a priori questions and themes followed by data categorisation, reduction, display and conclusion drawing. Results showed six themes related to mental health stressors including economics (e.g., job insecurity), immigration (e.g., undocumented status), misinformation, family stress (e.g., changes in family dynamics and the home environment), health (e.g., limited healthcare access) and social isolation. Coping skills of the community were categorised into four themes with multiple codes including behavioural strategies (e.g., identifying reliable information), cognitive strategies (e.g., collectivistic thinking), social support and spirituality. Findings indicate that underserved Latinx communities are dealing with substantial distress and mental health concerns secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic; yet these are resilient communities. Implications of these findings can inform development of resources, interventions, best practices and training avenues to address the mental health needs of underserved Latinx communities, while considering relevant cultural and contextual factors that may influence their effectiveness.","Garcini, Luz M; Rosenfeld, Jason; Kneese, Garrett; Bondurant, Ruth G; Kanzler, Kathryn E",Heal. soc. care community,368,1

An immediate medical breakthrough is needed. However, parallel to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic is the proliferation of information regarding the pandemic, which, if uncontrolled, cannot only mislead the public but also hinder the concerted efforts of relevant stakeholders in mitigating the effect of this pandemic. It is known that media communications can affect public perception and attitude toward medical treatment, vaccination, or subject matter, particularly when the population has limited knowledge on the subject. OBJECTIVE: This study attempts to systematically scrutinize media communications (Google News headlines or snippets and Twitter posts) to understand the prevailing sentiments regarding COVID-19 vaccines in Africa. METHODS: A total of 637 Twitter posts and 569 Google News headlines or descriptions, retrieved between February 2 and May 5, 2020, were analyzed using three standard computational linguistics models (ie, TextBlob, Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner, and Word2Vec combined with a bidirectional long short-term memory neural network). RESULTS: Our findings revealed that, contrary to general perceptions, Google News headlines or snippets and Twitter posts within the stated period were generally passive or positive toward COVID-19 vaccines in Africa. It was possible to understand these patterns in light of increasingly sustained efforts by various media and health actors in ensuring the availability of factual information about the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: This type of analysis could contribute to understanding predominant polarities and associated potential attitudinal inclinations. Such knowledge could be critical in informing relevant public health and media engagement policies.","Gbashi, Sefater; Adebo, Oluwafemi Ayodeji; Doorsamy, Wesley; Njobeh, Patrick Berka",JMIR Med Inform,368,16

This study examines how socially isolated individuals with a history of heavy drinking used alcohol during the pandemic. METHODS: Data for this study came from an add-on to the Managing Heavy Drinking (MHD) longitudinal study of drivers convicted of DWI that was conducted in Erie County, New York. Pre-COVID information (October 2019-March 2020) was augmented with a COVID-19 questionnaire collected between July and August 2020. A total of 92 participants completed the COVID-19 survey. RESULTS: The sample of problem drinkers showed a significant increase after the pandemic outbreak in the average number of drinking days from 1.99 to 2.49 per week (p = 0.047), but a significant decrease in the average number of drinks per drinking day, from 3.74 to 2.74 (p = 0.003). The proportion of individuals who drank more frequently was greater among those who, before the outbreak had an Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) score <8 (26% increase) compared with those with an AUDIT score of >8 (13%). Alcohol treatment was also associated with the frequency of drinking, with individuals who were not in alcohol treatment showing a 16% increase in frequency compared with a 10% increase among those in treatment. Further, individuals who, after the outbreak worried about their health (30%) or finances (37%) reported greater increases in the frequency of drinking than those who did not worry about their health (17%) or finances (10%). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the individuals in our sample showed small changes in the frequency andheaviness of drinking after the outbreak of COVID-19, effects that opposite in direction from one another and thus resulted in no overall change in drinks consumed. Nonetheless, we identified factors that influenced the effects of the pandemic ond rinking behavior among individuals convicted of DWI, which emphasizes the need to individualize these individuals' treatment, particularly in the context of dramatic environmental change.","Manning, Amy R; Romano, Eduardo; Diebold, Josal; Nochajski, Thomas H; Taylor, Eileen; Voas, Robert B; Scherer, Michael",Alcohol. clin. exp. res,368,27

We predicted that greater impairments in emotional and social cognition would be observed in people who experienced more disruption to their usual social connectivity during COVID-19 social isolation. Healthy volunteers (N = 92) without prior mental health problems completed assessments online in their own homes during the most stringent period of the first COVID-19 ""lockdown"" in the UK (March - May 2020). Measures included two questionnaires probing levels of social isolation, anxiety levels, as well as five neuropsychological tasks assessing emotional and social cognition. Reduced positive bias in emotion recognition was related to reduced contact with friends, household size and communication method during social isolation. In addition, reduced positive bias for attention to emotional faces was related to frequency of contact with friends during social isolation. Greater cooperative behaviour in an ultimatum game was associated with more frequent contact with both friends and family during social isolation. The present study provides important insights into the detrimental effects of subjective and objective social isolation upon affective cognitive processes.","Bland, Amy Rachel; Roiser, Jonathan Paul; Mehta, Mitul Ashok; Sahakian, Barbara Jacquelyn; Robbins, Trevor William; Elliott, Rebecca",Cogn Emot,368,1

This study also aimed to see CT changes with clinical recovery or progression of disease. Materials and methods: In an attempt to provide extensive information pertaining to clinical and radiological characteristics of COVID-19, the present study was undertaken in 80 hospitalized patients. The patients were COVID-19 confirmed positive by genomic analysis through RT-PCR at tertiary care center in Jaipur. Initially all patients were evaluated for their clinical parameters and then correlated with HRCT chest after hospitalization. CT findings correlated with duration of disease to assess progress or recovery. Results: A total of 80 patients of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 test by RT-PCR at SMS Hospitals, Jaipur were assessed. Among the confirmed cases, most of patients were young adults in the fifth and sixth decade of age group with mean age of 50.40 years. There was a male preponderance (59% male and 41% female). Out of total analyzed patients, 39 patients (48.75%) were symptomatic, among them fever (79.47%), cough (74.35%), shortness of breath (36%) and sore throat (17.94%) were the most common presenting clinical manifestations. A few patients (12.82%) also had other symptoms like headache, chest pain, pain abdomen, altered sensorium etc. 54% patients had some underlying co morbid disease in sample population. The most prevalent comorbidities were Diabetes mellitus (56%), Hypertension (48.83%), COPD/K-chest (12%), CAD (9.32%) and others (11.62%) like hypothyroidism, anemia, CVA etc. The lung pathological changes were evaluated by HRCT imaging and by assigning CT severity score. We found Typical COVID findings in 50% patients, Indeterminate in 11%, Atypical in 11% and 28% patients had Negative CT chest for COVID. The clinical status of patients correlated with the CT severity score, with mild cases showing score <15/25 in 45.83% patients and severe cases showing CT severity score >15/25 in 87.50% patients. The CT features varied with duration and course of disease. Proportional GGO was higher (59.37%) in early phase and it was lower (12.5%) in later stage of disease. Conclusion: The varied spectra of COVID-19 presentation included fever, cough, shortness of breath, sore throat etc. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension, COPD/K-Chest and CAD were found as major comorbid conditions. Symptomatic presentation of COVID-19 was observed to be higher in patients with co morbid disease, especially if multiple. HRCT chest in COVID-19 patients had a major diagnostic and prognostic importance as positive CT findings were more prominent in symptomatic patients and co-morbid patients. Clinical symptoms of patients directly correlated with CT severity index. CT imaging was found to be useful in predicting clinical recovery of patients or progression of disease.","Bhandari, Sudhir; Rankawat, Govind; Bagarhatta, Meenu; Singh, Ajeet; Singh, Aparna; Gupta, Vishal; Sharma, Shrikant; Sharma, Raman",J Assoc Physicians India,368,26

In this study, we study the spinescence traits from five different species rattan: Daemonorops lewisiana, Daemonorops geniculata, Calamus castaneus, Plectomia griffithii, and Korthalsia scortechinii. We tested length, width, angle, strength, spine density, cross-section surface, spine color, and leaf trichomes (only for D. lewisiana, C. castaneus and D. geniculata). We also tested whether the spines were capable of deterring small climbing mammals (for Plectomia griffithii and Calamus castaneus) by using a choice selection experiment. Due to a variety of spine traits, we could not categorize whether any species is more or less spinescent than the others. We suggest that spines have a much more significant role than merely as a physical defense and work together with other rattan characteristics. This is also evidenced by our choice selection experiment, in which the spines on a single stem donot deter small climbing mammals. However, this is a work in progress, and we have outlined several alternative methods to be used in future work.","Liu, Kunpeng; Mansor, Asyraf; Ruppert, Nadine; Fadzly, Nik",Plant Signal Behav,368,20

Dentists fall in this category, as not only do they operate with aerosol generating procedures but also operate within a face-to-face contact area. METHODS: A structured self-administered questionnaire was developed at Najran University and provided to the participants for data collection. The data collected included information on risk perception and incorporation of measures for protection against COVID-19 to gauge the attitude of dentists during this period. Also, clinical implementation of various protective measures was reviewed. RESULTS: Of the n = 322 dentists that answered the questions, 50% were general dentists and 28.9% were dentists working at specialist clinics, while the remaining 21.1% of dentists were employed in academic institutions. Among the newer additions to the clinic, 36.3% of dentists answered that they had added atomizers to their practices, followed by 26.4% of dentists that had incorporated the use of UV lamps for sterilization. We found that 18.9% dentists were using HEPA filters in their clinics, while 9.9% of dentists were making use of fumigation devices to control the risk of infection. One-way ANOVA was also carried out to demonstrate that there was a statistically significant difference (p = 0.049) between groups of dentists utilizing HEPA filters, UV lamps, atomizers, and fumigation devices to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV2 across their workplaces. CONCLUSION: Dentists are aware of recently updated knowledge about the modes of transmission of COVID-19 and the recommended infection control measures in dental settings. A better understanding of the situation and methods to prevent it will ensure that the dental community is able to provide healthcare services to patients during the pandemic.","Marya, Anand; Karobari, Mohmed Isaqali; Selvaraj, Siddharthan; Adil, Abdul Habeeb; Assiry, Ali A; Rabaan, Ali A; Horn, Rithvitou; Venugopal, Adith; Messina, Pietro; Scardina, Giuseppe Alessandro",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),368,1

As the disease is spreading rapidly all over the world, it is urgent to find effective drugs to treat the virus. The main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2 is one of the potential drug targets. Therefore, in this context, we used rigorous computational methods, including molecular docking, fast pulling of ligand (FPL), and free energy perturbation (FEP), to investigate potential inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. We first tested our approach with three reported inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, and our computational results are in good agreement with the respective experimental data. Subsequently, we applied our approach on a database of â¼4600 natural compounds, as well as 8 available HIV-1 protease (PR) inhibitors and an aza-peptide epoxide. Molecular docking resulted in a short list of 35 natural compounds, which was subsequently refined using the FPL scheme. FPL simulations resulted in five potential inhibitors, including three natural compounds and two available HIV-1 PR inhibitors. Finally, FEP, the most accurate and precise method, was used to determine the absolute binding free energy of these five compounds. FEP results indicate that two natural compounds, cannabisin A and isoacteoside, and an HIV-1 PR inhibitor, darunavir, exhibit a large binding free energy to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro, which is larger than that of 13b, the most reliable SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitor recently reported. The binding free energy largely arises from van der Waals interaction. We also found that Glu166 forms H-bonds to all of the inhibitors. Replacing Glu166 by an alanine residue leads to â¼2.0 kcal/mol decreases in the affinity of darunavir to SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Our results could contribute to the development of potential drugs inhibiting SARS-CoV-2.","Ngo, Son Tung; Quynh Anh Pham, Ngoc; Thi Le, Ly; Pham, Duc-Hung; Vu, Van V",J. chem. inf. model,368,22

In reality, Australia is very far away from addressing the societal level drivers of health inequity. There is little progressive policy that touches on the conditions of daily life that matter for health, and action to redress inequities in power, money and resources is almost non-existent. In this chapter we ask you to pause this reality and come on a fantastic journey where we envisage how COVID-19 was a great disruptor and accelerator of positive progressive action. We offer glimmers of what life could be like if there was committed and real policy action on the social determinants of health equity. It is vital that the health sector assists in convening the multisectoral stakeholders necessary to turn this fantasy into reality. CHAPTER 2: ABORIGINAL AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER CONNECTION TO CULTURE: BUILDING STRONGER INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE WELLBEING: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have long maintained that culture (ie, practising, maintaining and reclaiming it) is vital to good health and wellbeing. However, this knowledge and understanding has been dismissed or described as anecdotal or intangible by Western research methods and science. As a result, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture is a poorly acknowledged determinant of health and wellbeing, despite its significant role in shaping individuals, communities and societies. By extension, the cultural determinants of health have been poorly defined until recently. However, an increasing amount of scientific evidence supports what Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have always said - that strong culture plays a significant and positive role in improved health and wellbeing. Owing to known gaps in knowledge, we aim to define the cultural determinants of health and describe their relationship with the social determinants of health, to provide a full understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander wellbeing. We provide examples of evidence on cultural determinants of health and links to improved Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and wellbeing. We also discuss future research directions that will enable a deeper understanding of the cultural determinants of health for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. CHAPTER 3: PHYSICAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH: HEALTHY, LIVEABLE AND SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES: Good city planning is essential for protecting and improving human and planetary health. Until recently, however, collaboration between city planners and the public health sector has languished. We review the evidence on the health benefits of good city planning and propose an agenda for public health advocacy relating to health-promoting city planning for all by 2030. Over the next 10 years, there is an urgent need for public health leaders to collaborate with city planners - to advocate for evidence-informed policy, and to evaluate the health effects of city planning efforts. Importantly, we need integrated planning across and between all levels of government and sectors, to create healthy, liveable and sustainable cities for all. CHAPTER 4: HEALTH PROMOTION IN THE ANTHROPOCENE: THE ECOLOGICAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH: Human health is inextricably linked to the health of the natural environment. In this chapter, we focus on ecological determinants of health, including the urgent and critical threats to the natural environment, and opportunities for health promotion arising from the human health co-benefits of actions to protect the health of the planet. We characterise ecological determinants in the Anthropocene and provide a sobering snapshot of planetary health science, particularly the momentous climate change health impacts in Australia. We highlight Australia's position as a major fossil fuel producer and exporter, and a country lacking cohesive and timely emissions reduction policy. We offer a roadmap for action, with four priority directions, and point to a scaffold of guiding approaches - planetary health, Indigenous people's knowledge systems, ecological economics, health co-benefits and climate-resilient development. Our situation requires a paradigm shift, and this demands a recalibration of health promotion education, research and practice in Australia over the coming decade. CHAPTER 5: DISRUPTING THE COMMERCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH: Our vision for 2030 is an Australian economy that promotes optimal human and planetary health for current and future generations. To achieve this, current patterns of corporate practice and consumption of harmful commodities and services need to change. In this chapter, we suggest ways forward for Australia, focusing on pragmatic actions that can be taken now to redress the power imbalances between corporations and Australian governments and citizens. We begin by exploring how the terms of health policy making must change to protect it from conflicted commercial interests. We also examine how marketing unhealthy products and services can be more effectively regulated, and how healthier business practices can be incentivised. Finally, we make recommendations on how various public health stakeholders can hold corporations to account, to ensure that people come before profits in a healthy and prosperous future Australia. CHAPTER 6: DIGITAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH: THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION: We live in an age of rapid and exponential technological change. Extraordinary digital advancements and the fusion of technologies, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things and quantum computing constitute what is often referred to as the digital revolution or the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). Reflections on the future of public health and health promotion require thorough consideration of the role of digital technologies and the systems they influence. Just how the digital revolution will unfold is unknown, but it is clear that advancements and integrations of technologies will fundamentally influence our health and wellbeing in the future. The public health response must be proactive, involving many stakeholders, and thoughtfully considered to ensure equitable and ethical applications and use. CHAPTER 7: GOVERNANCE FOR HEALTH AND EQUITY: A VISION FOR OUR FUTURE: Coronavirus disease 2019 has caused many people and communities to take stock on Australia's direction in relation to health, community, jobs, environmental sustainability, income and wealth. A desire for change is in the air. This chapter imagines how changes in the way we govern our lives and what we value as a society could solve many of the issues Australia is facing - most pressingly, the climate crisis and growing economic and health inequities. We present an imagined future for 2030 where governance structures are designed to ensure transparent and fair behaviour from those in power and to increase the involvement of citizens in these decisions, including a constitutional voice for Indigenous peoples.

During the early months of the pandemic, when little was known about the virus, the acute hypoxemic respiratory failure it caused did not appear to fit conveniently or consistently into our classification of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This not only re-ignited a half-century's long simmering debate over taxonomy, but also fueled similar debates over how PEEP and lung-protective ventilation should be titrated, as well as the appropriate role of non-invasive ventilation in ARDS. Furthermore, COVID-19 ignited other debates on emerging concepts such as ARDS phenotypes and patient self-inflicted lung injury from vigorous spontaneous breathing. Over a year later these early perplexities have receded into the background without having been reviewed or resolved. With a full year of evidence having been published this narrative review systematically analyzes whether or not COVID-19 associated respiratory failure is essentially ARDS, with perhaps a somewhat different course of presentation. This includes a review of the severity of hypoxemia and derangements in pulmonary mechanics, PEEP requirements, recruitment potential, the ability to achieve lung-protective ventilation goals, duration of mechanical ventilation, associated mortality, and response to non-invasive ventilation. It also reviews the concepts of ARDS phenotypes and patient self-inflicted lung injury as these are crucial to understanding the contentious debate over the nature and management of COVID-19.","Kallet, Richard H",Respir. care,368,14

Lockdowns and social distancing strategies effectively closed and could ultimately decimate the sector. With the pandemic affording people and planet some short-term relief from T&T’s impact on communities, destinations and the environment, this is the time to re-imagine the sector. Looking ahead, a range of approaches to advance sustainable T&T could help it ‘build back better’, attenuating its negative impacts and advancing the contribution T&T makes to global citizenship and to a more balanced economy and equitable society. T&T business leaders are widening their view of sustainability beyond immediate operational impact to consider the broader systems in which they operate, adopting sustainability leadership practices for the twenty-first century and beyond. COVID-19 represents a ‘teachable moment’ for the T&T sector to accelerate sustainability, paying greater attention to the trade-offs and dilemmas presented by its activities. Indeed, T&T has enormous potential to educate the traveler and drive fulfilment of the Sustainable Development Goals.

We therefore aimed to assess the effects of vaccine characteristics, information on herd immunity, and general practitioner (GP) recommendation on vaccine hesitancy in a representative working-age population in France. METHODS: In this survey experiment, adults aged 18-64 years residing in France, with no history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, were randomly selected from an online survey research panel in July, 2020, stratified by gender, age, education, household size, and region and area of residence to be representative of the French population. Participants completed an online questionnaire on their background and vaccination behaviour-related variables (including past vaccine compliance, risk factors for severe COVID-19, and COVID-19 perceptions and experience), and were then randomly assigned according to a full factorial design to one of three groups to receive differing information on herd immunity (>50% of adults aged 18-64 years must be immunised [either by vaccination or infection]; >50% of adults must be immunised [either by vaccination or infection]; or no information on herd immunity) and to one of two groups regarding GP recommendation of vaccination (GP recommends vaccination or expresses no opinion). Participants then completed a series of eight discrete choice tasks designed to assess vaccine acceptance or refusal based on hypothetical vaccine characteristics (efficacy [50%, 80%, 90%, or 100%], risk of serious side-effects [1 in 10â000 or 1 in 100â000], location of manufacture [EU, USA, or China], and place of administration [GP practice, local pharmacy, or mass vaccination centre]). Responses were analysed with a two-part model to disentangle outright vaccine refusal (irrespective of vaccine characteristics, defined as opting for no vaccination in all eight tasks) from vaccine hesitancy (acceptance depending on vaccine characteristics). FINDINGS: Survey responses were collected from 1942 working-age adults, of whom 560 (28·8%) opted for no vaccination in all eight tasks (outright vaccine refusal) and 1382 (71·2%) did not. In our model, outright vaccine refusal and vaccine hesitancy were both significantly associated with female gender, age (with an inverted U-shaped relationship), lower educational level, poor compliance with recommended vaccinations in the past, and no report of specified chronic conditions (ie, no hypertension [for vaccine hesitancy] or no chronic conditions other than hypertension [for outright vaccine refusal]). Outright vaccine refusal was also associated with a lower perceived severity of COVID-19, whereas vaccine hesitancy was lower when herd immunity benefits were communicated and in working versus non-working individuals, and those with experience of COVID-19 (had symptoms or knew someone with COVID-19). For a mass vaccination campaign involving mass vaccination centres and communication of herd immunity benefits, our model predicted outright vaccine refusal in 29·4% (95% CI 28·6-30·2) of the French working-age population. Predicted hesitancy was highest for vaccines manufactured in China with 50% efficacy and a 1 in 10â000 risk of serious side-effects (vaccine acceptance 27·4% [26·8-28·0]), and lowest for a vaccine manufactured in the EU with 90% efficacy and a 1 in 100â000 risk of serious side-effects (vaccine acceptance 61·3% [60·5-62·1]). INTERPRETATION: COVID-19 vaccine acceptance depends on the characteristics of new vaccines and the national vaccination strategy, among various other factors, in the working-age population in France.

This suggested that monitoring of these searches with tools including Google Trends may help monitor the pandemic itself. In Europe and North America, dermatologists reported an unexpected outbreak of cutaneous acral lesions (eg, chilblain-like lesions) in April 2020. However, external factors such as public communications may also hinder the use of Google Trends as an infodemiology tool. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to assess the impact of media announcements and lockdown enforcement on internet searches related to cutaneous acral lesions during the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020. METHODS: Two searches on Google Trends, including daily relative search volumes for (1) ""toe"" or ""chilblains"" and (2) ""coronavirus,"" were performed from January 1 to May 16, 2020, with the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Spain, and Germany as the countries of choice. The ratio of interest over time in ""chilblains"" and ""coronavirus"" was plotted. To assess the impact of lockdown enforcement and media coverage on these internet searches, we performed an interrupted time-series analysis for each country. RESULTS: The ratio of interest over time in ""chilblains"" to ""coronavirus"" showed a constant upward trend. In France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, lockdown enforcement was associated with a significant slope change for ""chilblain"" searches with a variation coefficient of 1.06 (SE 0.42) (P=0.01), 1.04 (SE 0.28) (P<.01), and 1.21 (SE 0.44) (P=0.01), respectively. After media announcements, these ratios significantly increased in France, Spain, Italy, and the United States with variation coefficients of 18.95 (SE 5.77) (P=.001), 31.31 (SE 6.31) (P<.001), 14.57 (SE 6.33) (P=.02), and 11.24 (SE 4.93) (P=.02), respectively, followed by a significant downward trend in France (-1.82 [SE 0.45]), Spain (-1.10 [SE 0.38]), and Italy (-0.93 [SE 0.33]) (P<.001, P=0.004, and P<.001, respectively). The adjusted R2 values were 0.311, 0.351, 0.325, and 0.305 for France, Spain, Italy, and the United States, respectively, suggesting an average correlation between time and the search volume; however, this correlation was weak for Germany and the United Kingdom. CONCLUSIONS: To date, the association between chilblain-like lesions and COVID-19 remains controversial; however, our results indicate that Google queries of ""chilblain"" were highly influenced by media coverage and government policies, indicating that caution should be exercised when using Google Trends as a monitoring tool for emerging diseases.","Huynh Dagher, Solene; Lamé, Guillaume; Hubiche, Thomas; Ezzedine, Khaled; Duong, Tu Anh",JMIR Public Health Surveill,368,16

Results from a single Italian centre",19.102676,9.428478,2020,"Freshwater ecosystems are constantly threatened by the advance of agricultural activities. Abiotic variables (such as temperature, ammonia, and nitrite) and contaminants (e.g. pesticides) can potentially interact, increasing metabolism and the absorption of toxic substances, which can alter the ability of organisms to establish adequate stress responses. This study aimed to verify which pesticides were most frequently found and in the greatest quantities in low-order streams, and whether the combination of these pesticides with the abiotic variables altered the biological metabolism of aeglids. These freshwater crustaceans are important shredders that inhabit low-order streams and are sensitive to disturbances and/or abrupt environmental variations. The animals were exposed in situ in four streams (reference site and sites 1, 2, and 3). The reference site is a preserved stream with no apparent anthropogenic interference where aeglids still occur, while the other sites no longer exhibit populations of these animals and are influenced by agricultural activities. The exposure was performed bimonthly from November 2017 to September 2018 and lasted 96 h. Measured abiotic data and water samples were collected through all days of exposure. The analyzed biochemical parameters were acetylcholinesterase activity in muscle; and glutathione S-transferase, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, non-protein thiols, antioxidant capacity against peroxides, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in muscle, gills, and hepatopancreas. We found 24 active principles of pesticides, the most frequently being clomazone, atrazine, and propoxur. Bentazone was present at the highest amounts. The parameters evaluated in this study, including biochemical biomarkers and abiotic factors measured from the water, provided a separation of the months as a function of environmental conditions. There was a difference in activity and biomarker levels throughout the year within the same site and in some months between sites. The greater concentration or variety of pesticides associated with extreme abiotic (very high temperatures) data generated increased oxidative stress, with high levels of protein damage and considerable lipid damage in all tissues, as well as elevation in ROS, even with high levels of antioxidant capacity and non-protein thiols. With these data, we intend to warn about the risks of exposure to these environmental conditions by trying to contribute to the preservation of limnic fauna, especially aeglid crabs, because most species are under some degree of threat.","Cerezer, Cristina; Marins, Aline Teixeira; Cerezer, Felipe Osmari; Severo, Eduardo Stringini; Leitemperger, Jossiele Wesz; Grubel Bandeira, Nelson Miguel; Zanella, Renato; Loro, Vania Lucia; Santos, Sandro",Ecotoxicol Environ Saf,368,12

However, molecular data strongly and consistently suggest that hylobatids should be present by approximately 20 Ma; thus, there are large temporal, geographical, and morphological gaps between early fossil apes in Africa and the earliest fossil hylobatids in China. Here, we describe a new approximately 12.5-13.8 Ma fossil ape from the Lower Siwaliks of Ramnagar, India, that fills in these long-standing gaps with implications for hylobatid origins. This ape represents the first new hominoid species discovered at Ramnagar in nearly a century, the first new Siwalik ape taxon in more than 30 years, and likely extends the hylobatid fossil record by approximately 5 Myr, providing a minimum age for hylobatid dispersal coeval to that of great apes. The presence of crown hylobatid molar features in the new species indicates an adaptive shift to a more frugivorous diet during the Middle Miocene, consistent with other proposed adaptations to frugivory (e.g. uricase gene silencing) during this time period as well.","Gilbert, Christopher C; Ortiz, Alejandra; Pugh, Kelsey D; Campisano, Christopher J; Patel, Biren A; Singh, Ningthoujam Premjit; Fleagle, John G; Patnaik, Rajeev",Proc Biol Sci,368,26

Viral infections alone do not lead to virus-induced malignancies, as both genetic and host safety factors are also involved in the occurrence of malignancies. Acquired immune responses, through the differentiation of Th17 cells, form the novel components of the Th17 cell pathway when reacting with viral infections all the way from the beginning to its final stages. As a result, instead of inducing the right immune responses, these events lead to the suppression of the immune system. In fact, the responses from Th17 cells during persistent viral infections causes chronic inflammation through the production of IL-17 and other cytokines which provide a favorable environment for tumor growth and its development. Additionally, during the past decade, these cells have been understood to be involved in tumor progression and metastasis. However, further research is required to understand Th17 cells' immune mechanisms in the vast variety of viral diseases. This review aims to determine the roles and effects of the immune system, especially Th17 cells, in the progression of viral diseases; which can be highly beneficial for the diagnosis and treatment of these infections.","Aghbash, Parisa Shiri; Hemmat, Nima; Nahand, Javid Sadri; Shamekh, Ali; Memar, Mohammad Yousef; Babaei, Abouzar; Baghi, Hossein Bannazadeh",Int Immunopharmacol,368,9

Neurorehabilitation has been progressively relying on computer-assisted programs and, more recently, on virtual reality (VR). Current reviews explore VR-based neurorehabilitation for assessing and treating the most common neurological pathologies. However, none of them explored specifically the impact of VR on multiple cognitive domains. AREAS COVERED: The present work is a review of six years of literature (2015-2020) on VR in neurorehabilitation with the purpose of analysing its effects on memory, attention, executive functions, language and visuospatial ability. EXPERT OPINION: Our review suggests that VR-based neurorehabilitation showed encouraging results for executive functions and visuospatial abilities particularly for both acute and neurodegenerative conditions. Conversely, memory and attention outcomes are conflicting, and language did not show significant improvements following VR-based rehabilitation. Within five years, it is plausible that VR-based intervention would be provided in standalone and mobile-based platforms that won't need a PC to work, with reduced latency and improved user interaction.","Riva, Giuseppe; Mancuso, Valentina; Cavedoni, Silvia; Stramba-Badiale, Chiara",,368,24

AIMS: To provide a brief overview of the existing evidence for such differences in host response and outcome, and generate hypotheses for divergent patterns and avenues for future research, by highlighting similarities and differences in histopathological appearance between COVID-19 and influenza as well as previous coronavirus outbreaks, and by discussing predisposition through genetics and underlying disease. MATERIALS AND METHOD: We assessed the available early literature for histopathological patterns of COVID-19 pneumonia and underlying risk factors. RESULT: The histopathological spectrum of COVID-19 pneumonia includes variable patterns of epithelial damage, vascular complications, fibrosis and inflammation. Risk factors for a fatal disease include older age, respiratory disease, diabetes mellitus, obesity and hypertension. DISCUSSION: While some risk factors and their potential role in COVID-19 pneumonia are increasingly recognized, little is known about the mechanisms behind episodes of sudden deterioration or the infrequent idiosyncratic clinical demise in otherwise healthy and young subjects. CONCLUSION: The answer to many of the remaining questions regarding COVID-19 pneumonia pathogenesis may in time be provided by genotyping as well careful clinical, serological, radiological and histopathological phenotyping.","von der Thüsen, Jan; van der Eerden, Menno",Eur J Clin Invest,368,20

Some low- and middle-income countries have highlighted the challenges with COVID-19 testing, such as inadequate capacity, untrained laboratory personnel, and inadequate funding. This article describes the components and implementation of a healthcare worker surveillance programme in a designated COVID-19 teaching hospital in Malaysia. In addition, the distribution and characteristics of healthcare workers placed under surveillance are described. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A COVID-19 healthcare worker surveillance programme was implemented in University Malaya Medical Centre. The programme involved four teams: contact tracing, risk assessment, surveillance and outbreak investigation. Daily symptom surveillance was conducted over fourteen days for healthcare workers who were assessed to have low-, moderate- and high-risk of contracting COVID-19. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted for data collected over 24 weeks, from the 6th of March 2020 to the 20th of August 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1,174 healthcare workers were placed under surveillance. The majority were females (71.6%), aged between 25 and 34 years old (64.7%), were nursing staff (46.9%) and had no comorbidities (88.8%). A total of 70.9% were categorised as low-risk, 25.7% were moderate-risk, and 3.4% were at high risk of contracting COVID-19. One-third (35.2%) were symptomatic, with the sore throat (23.6%), cough (19.8%) and fever (5.0%) being the most commonly reported symptoms. A total of 17 healthcare workers tested positive for COVID-19, with a prevalence of 0.3% among all the healthcare workers. Risk category and presence of symptoms were associated with a positive COVID-19 test (p<0.001). Fever (p<0.001), cough (p = 0.003), shortness of breath (p = 0.015) and sore throat (p = 0.002) were associated with case positivity. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 symptom surveillance and risk-based assessment have merits to be included in a healthcare worker surveillance programme to safeguard the health of the workforce.","Wan, Kim Sui; Tok, Peter Seah Keng; Yoga Ratnam, Kishwen Kanna; Aziz, Nuraini; Isahak, Marzuki; Ahmad Zaki, Rafdzah; Nik Farid, Nik Daliana; Hairi, Noran Naqiah; Rampal, Sanjay; Ng, Chiu-Wan; Samsudin, Mohd Fauzy; Venugopal, Vinura; Asyraf, Mohammad; Damanhuri, Narisa Hatun; Doraimuthu, Sanpagavalli; Arumugam, Catherine Thamarai; Marthammuthu, Thaneswaran; Nawawi, Fathhullah Azmie; Baharudin, Faiz; Chong, Diane Woei Quan; Jayaraj, Vivek Jason; Magarita, Venna; Ponnampalavanar, Sasheela; Hasnan, Nazirah; Kamarulzaman, Adeeba; Said, Mas Ayu",PLoS One,368,16

Targeting these aspects of SARS-CoV-2 is important as the pandemic affects greater proportions of the population. In clinical and animal studies, fucoidans have been shown to increase innate immunity and decrease inflammation. In addition, dietary fucoidan has been shown to attenuate pulmonary damage in a model of acute viral infection. Direct inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro has been described, but is not universal.

Physicians are being called upon to be both managers-able to set processes and structures-and leaders-capable of creating vision and inspiring action. Although these skills may have been previously considered as just nice to have, they are now as central to being a physician as physiology and biochemistry. While traditionally only selected physicians have received management training, either through executive or joint degree programs, the authors argue that the pandemic has highlighted the importance of all physicians learning management and leadership skills. Training should emphasize skills related to interpersonal management, systems management, and communication and planning; be seamlessly integrated into the medical curriculum alongside existing content; and be delivered by existing faculty with leadership experience. While leadership programs, such as the Pediatric Leadership for the UnderServed Program at the University of California, San Francisco, and the Clinical Process Improvement Leadership Program at Mass General Brigham, may include project work, instruction by clinical leaders, and content delivered over time, examples of leadership training that seamlessly blend biomedical and management training are lacking. The authors present the Leader and Leadership Education and Development curriculum used at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, which is woven through 4 years of medical school, as an example of leadership training that approximates many of the principles espoused here. The COVID-19 pandemic has stretched the logistical capabilities of health care systems and the entire United States, revealing that management and leadership skills-often viewed as soft skills-are a matter of life and death.

The World Health Organization (WHO) proposed a new name coronavirus disease (COVID-19) for this disease, whereas the International Committee on Virus Taxonomy renamed 2019-nCov as SARS-Cov-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2). The development of the COVID-19 pandemic is not only of great social importance, but also draws the attention of a medical community to the fundamentally new clinical and fundamental problems of the immunopathology of human diseases that are yet to be formulated. The unique experience gained in rheumatology from studies of the pathogenetic mechanisms and pharmacotherapy of immune-mediated inflammatory rheumatic diseases (IMIRDs) can be of great importance for deciphering the nature of the pathological processes that underlie the severe, potentially fatal complications of COVID-19, and may assist in improving their therapy. As for prospects in patients with IMIRDs, although the development of COVID-19 in the presence of IMIRDs has not yet fortunately been described, infection with SARS-CoV-2, like other viruses, can be assumed to cause an exacerbation of the pathological process, whereas severe immune system pathology and comorbidities can worsen the course of infection. Since, according to the current concepts, it is the «hyperimmune» response, and not just the effect only of the virus itself, that underlies lung damage and deaths from COVID-19, special attention is drawn to the effects of antirheumatic therapy that includes glucocorticoids, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), biological agents, and targeted DMARDs, which can have a multidirectional effect on the course of COVID-19. There are significant theoretical prerequisites for the repurposing of some drugs widely used in rheumatology for the treatment of COVID-19 and its complications. Consideration is given to the prospects of studying the immunopathology of COVID-19 and to the theoretical justifications for the use of antimalarial 4-aminoquinolines, anti-cytokine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), and Janus kinase inhibitors for the prevention of complications and for the treatment of COVID-19.","Nasonov, E.

METHODS: systematic review, searching seven databases using a comprehensive search strategy. We included cross-sectional prospective diagnostic studies on (1) clinical features, (2) diagnostic prediction rules based on clinical features alone, (3) blood tests and (4) diagnostic prediction rules combining clinical features and blood tests. Study participants had to be community-dwelling adults aged &#8805;65 years, in whom a physician suspected an infection. We used QUADAS-2 to assess risk of bias. We calculated measures of diagnostic accuracy and present descriptive statistics. RESULTS: out of 13,757 unique articles, only six studies with a moderate to high risk of bias were included. There was substantial clinical heterogeneity across these studies. Clinical features had LR- &#8805;0.61 and LR+ &#8804;4.94. Twelve prediction rules using clinical features had LR- &#8805;0.30 and LR+ &#8804;2.78. There was evidence on four blood tests of which procalcitonin was the most often investigated: levels <0.37 ng/ml (LR- = 0.20; 95%CI 0.10-0.42) were suitable to rule out sepsis in moderately high prevalence situations. Two diagnostic prediction rules combining clinical features and procalcitonin had LR- of &#8804;0.12 (95%CI 0.05-0.33) and LR+ of maximum 1.39 (95%CI 1.30-1.49). CONCLUSIONS: we found few studies on the diagnostic accuracy of clinical features and blood tests to detect serious infections in older people presenting to ambulatory care. The risk of bias was mostly moderate to high, leading to substantial uncertainty.","Struyf, Thomas; Boon, Hanne A; van de Pol, Alma C; Tournoy, Jos; Schuermans, Alexander; Verheij, Theo J M; Verbakel, Jan Y; Van den Bruel, Ann",Age ageing,368,16

However, neither measure stress during an evolving public health crisis. The aim was to refine the PSS to measure stress during an event (e.g. COVID-19 pandemic) and examine its psychometric properties within a 4-year Hispanic-Serving Institution in the Bronx, NY. Three items from the IES were added to and one PSS item was removed from the PSS-10, creating a new PSS-12. Cronbach's &#945; for the scale was 0.902 for faculty and 0.903 for students, indicating high internal consistency. Factor analyses also supported calculation of two subtotals similarly across groups. The PSS-12 is a valid instrument to measure perceived stress during a public health crisis, particularly among populations that already experience community health disparities.","Eubank, Jacob M; Burt, Kate G; Orazem, John",J Prev Interv Community,368,1

The MAC-RF is an eight-item, self-report scale that has been developed to assess clinically relevant domains of fear during the COVID-19 pandemic. The MAC-RF is based on a comprehensive theoretical model conceptualizing fears during the pandemics as resulting from an interaction of bodily, interpersonal, cognitive, and behavioral experiences. The MAC-RF was administered to a sample of 623 Italian adults from the community aged between 18 and 76 years old (M= 35.67, SD= 12.93), along with a measure of current clinical symptoms. Item response theory analyses demonstrated that each item of the MAC-RF provided sufficient information about the underlying construct of fear. The statistical fit of the scale was satisfactory. MAC-RF total scores correlated significantly and positively with total scores on the measure of psychopathology and with the clinical symptom domain scores. A ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis showed that the MAC-RF total score was sufficiently able to identify cases with high levels of current psychopathology, with an area under the curve of.76. These findings suggest that the MAC-RF can be used to assess pathological fear during pandemics. The English, Italian, and French versions of the MAC-RF are annexed to this article for use by clinicians and health services.","Schimmenti, Adriano; Starcevic, Vladan; Giardina, Alessandro; Khazaal, Yasser; Billieux, Joël",Front.

Social distancing and isolation have brought about challenges to student's mental health. Mobile health apps and wearable sensors may help to monitor students at risk for COVID-19 and support their mental well-being. OBJECTIVE: Through the use of a wearable sensor and smartphone-based survey completion, this study aimed to monitor students at risk for COVID-19. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of students, undergraduate and graduate, at a public university in the Midwest. Students were instructed to download the Fitbit, Social Rhythms, and Roadmap 2.0 apps onto their personal mobile devices (Android or iOS). Subjects consented to provide up to 10 saliva samples during the study period. Surveys were administered through the Roadmap 2.0 app at five timepoints - at baseline, 1-month later, 2-months later, 3-months later, and at study completion. The surveys gathered information regarding demographics, COVID-19 diagnoses and symptoms, and mental health resilience, with the aim of documenting the impact of COVID-19 on the college student population. RESULTS: This study enrolled 2,158 college students between September 2020 and January 2021. Subjects are currently being followed on-study for one academic year. Data collection and analysis are ongoing. CONCLUSIONS: This study examined student health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also assessed the feasibility of wearable sensor use and survey completion in a college student population, which may inform the role of our mobile health tools on student health and well-being. Finally, using wearable sensor data, biospecimen collection, and self-reported COVID-19 diagnosis, our results may provide key data towards the development of a model for the early prediction and detection of COVID-19.

Nitric oxide at a dose of 20 ppm was added to the sweep gas in the treatment group. Blood was collected at baseline and prior to separation from CPB to measure platelet count and function as determined by responsiveness to specific agonists. Clinical outcomes were observed through hospital discharge. Methemoglobin levels were measured preoperatively, at the conclusion of CPB, and upon admission to the ICU. Forty patients consented and were randomized in the trial. Eighteen patients were randomized to the treatment group and 22 were included in the placebo group. The groups were similar in terms of age, weight, gender, and surgical complexity. No significant differences were found in measures of platelet count, platelet response to agonist, or clinical outcomes. Patients in the treatment group had higher methemoglobin levels after receiving nitric oxide, but no levels approached toxicity (maximum 2.4%).

Subsequent implementation of a three-phase nationwide lockdown strategy greatly reduced infection numbers and hospitalizations. Yet we present evidence of sustained viral spread among sporadic clusters acting as ""hidden reservoirs"" during summer 2020. Mathematical modelling shows that increased mobility among residents eventually catalyzed the coalescence of such clusters, thus driving up the number of infections and initiating a new epidemic wave.

There has been much debate on whether the damage of COVID-19 is due predominantly to the pathogen itself or our response to it. We compare SARS-CoV-2 against three other major pandemics (1347 Black Death, 1520's new world smallpox outbreaks, and 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic) over the course of 700 years to unearth similarities and differences in pathogen, social and medical context, human response and behavior, and long-term social and economic impact that should be used to shape COVID-19 decision-making. We conclude that <100 years ago, pandemic disease events were still largely uncontrolled and unexplained. The extensive damage wreaked by historical pandemics on health, economy, and society was a function of pathogen characteristics and lack of public health resources. Though there remain many similarities in patterns of disease spread and response from 1300 onwards, the major risks posed by COVID-19 arise not from the pathogen, but from indirect effects of control measures on health and core societal activities. Our understanding of the epidemiology and effective treatment of this virus has rapidly improved and attention is shifting toward the identification of long-term control strategies that balance consideration of health in at risk populations, societal behavior, and economic impact. Policymakers should use lessons from previous pandemics to develop appropriate risk assessments and control plans for now-endemic COVID-19, and for future pandemics.","Patterson, Grace E; McIntyre, K Marie; Clough, Helen E; Rushton, Jonathan",Front Public Health,368,2

The aim of this study to investigate the prognostic value of right ventricular (RV) strain in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Consecutive adult patients admitted to the emergency room for COVID-19 between 1 and 30 April were included in this study. ECG was performed on hospital admission and was evaluated as blind. RV strain was defined as in the presence of one or more of the following ECG findings: complete or incomplete right ventricular branch block (RBBB), negative T wave in V1-V4 and presence of S1Q3T3. The main outcome measure was death during hospitalization. The relationship of variables to the main outcome was evaluated by multivariable Cox regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 324 patients with COVID-19 were included in the study; majority of patients were male (187, 58%) and mean age was 64.2 ± 14.1. Ninety-five patients (29%) had right ventricular strain according to ECG and 66 patients (20%) had died. After a multivariable survival analysis, presence of RV strain on ECG (OR: 4.385, 95%CI: 2.226-8.638, p < 0.001), high-sensitivity troponin I (hs-TnI), d-dimer and age were independent predictors of mortality.

Maternity care provisions have been challenged attempting to balance the needs and safety of pregnant women and their care providers. Women experiencing a pregnancy after loss (PAL) during these times face particularly difficult circumstances. AIM: In this paper we highlight the situation in three high income countries (Australia, Ireland and USA) and point to the need to remember the unique and challenging circumstances of these PAL families. We suggest new practices may be deviating from established evidence-based guidelines and outline the potential ramifications of these changes. FINDINGS: Recommendations for health care providers are suggested to bridge the gap between the necessary safety requirements due to the pandemic, the role of the health care provider, and the needs of families experiencing a pregnancy after loss. DISCUSSION: Changes to practices i.e. limiting the number of antenatal appointments and access to a support person may have detrimental effects on both mother, baby, and their family. However, new guidelines in maternity care practices developed to account for the pandemic have not necessarily considered women experiencing pregnancy after loss. CONCLUSION: Bereaved mothers and their families experiencing a pregnancy after loss should continue to be supported during the COVID-19 pandemic to limit unintended consequences.","Pollock, Danielle; Murphy, Margaret M; O039,; Leary, Joann; Warland, Jane",Women Birth,368,16

Many of these drugs suffer from polymorphic transformations with changes in the drug's safety and efficacy; many are poorly soluble, poorly bioavailable drugs. Current tools to reformulate antiviral APIs into safer and more bioavailable forms include pharmaceutical salts and cocrystals, even though it is difficult to classify solid forms into these regulatory-wise mutually exclusive categories. Pure liquid salt forms of APIs, ionic liquids that incorporate APIs into their structures (API-ILs) present all the advantages that salt forms provide from a pharmaceutical standpoint, without being subject to solid-state matter problems. In this perspective article, the myths and the most voiced concerns holding back implementation of API-ILs are examined, and two case studies of API-ILs antivirals (the amphoteric acyclovir and GSK2838232) are presented in detail, with a focus on drug property improvement. We advocate that the industry should consider the advantages of API-ILs which could be the genesis of disruptive innovation and believe that in order for the industry to grow and develop, the industry should be comfortable with a certain element of risk because progress often only comes from trying something different.","Shamshina, Julia L; Rogers, Robin D",,368,1

This study investigated expression of circular RNA (circRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) in sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) treated with a P2X7 R antagonist. METHODS: Sepsis was induced by tracheal administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the mice were then divided into two groups: without (sepsis + DMSO) or with P2X7 R antagonist treatment (sepsis + P2X7 A). Sham mice was administrated sterile normal saline. Serum levels of interleukin 1ß (IL-1ß) and tumor necrosis factor-&#945; (TNF-&#945;), pathological changes, cell apoptosis, and P2X7 R expression in lung were assessed, following with RNA-seq and bioinformatics analyses. RT-qPCR was used to validate circRNAs and mRNAs RESULTS: Compared with sham group, LPS-induced sepsis produced obvious pathological changes in lung tissue, increased apoptotic lung cells, serum TNF-&#945; and IL-1ß levels, and P2X7 R expression; P2X7 R antagonism significantly ameliorated these changes. RNA-seq identified many dysregulated circRNAs and mRNAs during sepsis, while changed with P2X7 R antagonism. RT-qPCR confirmed that Mus musculus (mmu)_circ_0001679, mmu_circ_0001212, Pln, Cdh2, and Nprl3 expression were significantly increased in sepsis + DMSO group compared with that in the sham group but were decreased in the sepsis + P2X7 A group compared with that in the sepsis + DMSO group. circRNA-miRNA-mRNA coexpression network indicated that mmu_circ_0001679 may regulate Nprl3 and that mmu_circ_0001212 may similarly regulate Pln, Cdh2, and Nprl3 as a ceRNA. CONCLUSIONS: P2X7 R antagonism attenuates sepsis-induced ALI by inhibiting dysregulated expression of circRNA (circ_0001679, circ_0001212) and mRNA (Pln, Cdh2, and Nprl3).","Zou, Zijun; Wang, Qin; Zhou, Minggen; Li, Weichao; Zheng, Yikai; Li, Fanyi; Zheng, Shengcai; He, Zhijie",J Gene Med,368,1

Clinicians and public health experts should be aware of emerging infectious causes of encephalitis, mechanisms by which they are transmitted, and clinical manifestations of disease. RECENT FINDINGS: A number of arthropod-borne viral infections -- transmitted chiefly by mosquitoes and ticks -- have emerged in recent years to cause outbreaks of encephalitis. Examples include Powassan virus in North America, Chikungunya virus in Central and South America, and tick-borne encephalitis virus in Europe. Many of these viruses exhibit complex life cycles and can infect multiple host animals in addition to humans. Factors thought to influence emergence of these diseases, including changes in climate and land use, are also believed to underlie the emergence of the rickettsial bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi, now recognized as a major causative agent of acute encephalitis syndrome in South Asia. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the role of bats as carriers of viruses. Recent studies have begun to uncover mechanisms by which the immune systems of bats are poised to allow for viral tolerance. Several bat-borne infections, including Nipah virus and Ebola virus, have resulted in recent outbreaks of encephalitis. SUMMARY: Infectious causes of encephalitis continue to emerge worldwide, in part because of climate change and human impacts on the environment. Expansion of surveillance measures will be critical in rapid diagnosis and limiting of outbreaks in the future.","Venkatesan, Arun",Curr Opin Neurol,368,1

We find that the private vehicle restriction policies reduce the degree of air pollution to a certain extent. However, their effect varies with other policies implemented in the same period and the economic development of the city itself. Through the analysis of different categories of restrictions, we find that restriction policy for local fuel vehicles and the restriction policy based on the last digit of license plate numbers have the best effect in reducing air pollution. Under the background of COVID-19 epidemic and the implementation of private vehicle restriction policies and other traffic control policies during this period, we have also obtained other enlightenment on air pollution control.","Chen, Zhongfei; Hao, Xinyue; Zhang, Xiaoyu; Chen, Fanglin",J.

The delivery of cardiovascular care has been stifled during the pandemic to adhere to infection control measures as a way of protecting patients and the workforce at large. This cautious approach has been protective since individuals with COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease are anticipated to have poorer outcomes and an increased risk of death. The combination of postponing elective cardiovascular surgeries, reduced acute care and long-term cardiac damage directly resulting from COVID-19 will likely have increased the demand for cardiac care, particularly from patients presenting with more severe symptoms. The combination of increased demand and inhibited supply will likely result in huge backlog of unmet patients' needs. The novelty, virulence and infectivity of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has caused substantial morbidity and mortality, thus necessitating modifications to the UK government's healthcare strategy. Without improving cost efficiency, the UK's ageing population will likely need an increasing spend on cardiac surgery simply to maintain the same level of service. However, the government's short-term increase in spending is unsustainable especially in the face of ongoing economic uncertainty. This means that the long-term impact of COVID-19 will only increase the need to find innovative ways of delivering equivalent or superior cardiac care at a reduced unit cost.","Osman, Fatima; Caplin, Noah; Bashir, Mohamad",J. card. surg,368,20

Antipsychotics are usually used for the pharmacological management of delirium, and confusion and behavioral disturbances. The concurrent use of treatments for COVID-19 and antipsychotics should consider eventual drug-drug interactions OBJECTIVE: To systematically review evidence-based available on drug-drug interactions between COVID-19 treatments and antipsychotics. EVIDENCE REVIEW: Three databases were consulted: Lexicomp® Drug Interactions, Micromedex® Solutions Drugs Interactions, and Liverpool© Drug Interaction Group for COVID-19 therapies. To acquire more information on QT prolongation and Torsade de Pointes (TdP), the CredibleMeds® QTDrugs List was searched. The authors made a recommendation agreed to by consensus. Additionally, a systematic review of drug-drug interactions between antipsychotics and COVID-19 treatment was conducted. RESULTS: The main interactions between COVID-19 drugs and antipsychotics are the risk of QT-prolongation and TdP, and cytochromes P450 interactions. Remdesivir, baricinitib, and anakinra can be used concomitantly with antipsychotics without risk of drug-drug interaction (except for hematological risk with clozapine and baricinitib). Favipiravir only needs caution with chlorpromazine and quetiapine. Tocilizumab is rather safe to use in combination with antipsychotics. The most demanding COVID-19 treatments for coadministration with antipsychotics are chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and lopinavir/ritonavir because of the risk of QT prolongation and TdP and cytochromes interactions. The systematic review provides highly probable drug interaction between lopinavir/ritonavir plus quetiapine and ritonavir/indinavir plus risperidone. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians prescribing antipsychotics should be aware of the likely risk of drug-drug interaction with COVID-19 medication and may benefit from taking into account present recommendations of use to preserve patient safety.","Plasencia-García, Beatriz Oda; Rodríguez-Menéndez, Gonzalo; Rico-Rangel, María Isabel; Rubio-García, Ana; Torelló-Iserte, Jaime; Crespo-Facorro, Benedicto",Psychopharmacology (Berl),368,16

CRC transcription factors create and engage super-enhancers by recruiting acetylation writers depositing permissive H3K27ac chromatin marks. These super-enhancers are largely associated with BET proteins, including BRD4, that influence higher-order chromatin structure. The orchestration of these events triggers accessibility of RNA polymerase machinery and the imposition of lineage-specific gene expression. In cancers, CRCs drive cell identity by superimposing developmental programmes on a background of genetic alterations. Further, the establishment and maintenance of oncogenic states are reliant on CRCs that drive factors involved in tumour development. Hence, the molecular dissection of CRC components driving cell identity and cancer state can contribute to elucidating mechanisms of diversion from pre-determined developmental programmes and highlight cancer dependencies. These insights can provide valuable opportunities for identifying and re-purposing drug targets. In this article, we review the current understanding of CRCs across solid and liquid malignancies and avenues of investigation for drug development efforts. We also review techniques used to understand CRCs and elaborate the indication of discussed CRC transcription factors in the wider context of cancer CRC models.","Jahangiri, Leila; Tsaprouni, Loukia; Trigg, Ricky M; Williams, John A; Gkoutos, Georgios V; Turner, Suzanne D; Pereira, Joao",Open Biol,368,29

Taking the central air conditioning system as an example, we analyze the mechanism and potential health risk of respiratory virus transmission in air-conditioned rooms and propose a method to study the risk of virus transmission in central air conditioning systems by investigating the data from medical experiments. The virus carrying capacity and the decay characteristics of indoor pathogen droplets are studied in this research. Additionally, the effects of air temperature and relative humidity on the virus survival in the air or on surfaces are investigated. The removal efficiency of infectious droplet nuclei by using an air conditioning filter was then determined. Thus, the transmission risk during the operation of the centralized air conditioning system is evaluated. The results show that the indoor temperature and humidity are controlled in the range of 20-25 °C and 40-70% by central air conditioning during the epidemic period, which not only benefits the health and comfort of residents, but also weakens the vitality of the virus. The larger the droplet size, the longer the viruses survive. Since the filter efficiency of the air conditioning filter increases with the increase in particle size, increasing the number of air changes of the circulating air volume can accelerate the removal of potential pathogen particles. Therefore, scientific operation of centralized air conditioning systems during the epidemic period has more advantages than disadvantages.","Jia, Yonghong; Xiang, Yue; Guo, Shurui; Guo, Lei; Guo, Luyao; Cheng, Zhu; Zhang, Yin; Zhang, Li; Long, Enshen",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

While COVID-19 has impacted the entire world, COVID-19 has disproportionately impacted low-income countries, particularly in South America, causing not only increased mortality but also increased associated mental health complaints. Anxiety sensitivity (AS), reflecting fear of anxiety-related physical sensations, may be particularly important to understand COVID-19 mental health effects among Latinx individuals in South America (Argentina). Past work suggests that Latinx individuals report greater somatization of mental health symptoms, and AS has been specifically linked to greater mental health symptoms. Yet, to date, no work has examined AS as a vulnerability factor for the negative mental health effects of COVID-19. Method: Therefore, the current manuscript examined the association of AS with COVID-19 worry, functional impairment, anxiety, and symptom severity across two samples of adults in Argentina: a community sample (n = 105, M age = 38.58, SD = 14.07, 69.5% female) and a clinical sample comprised of individuals with an anxiety disorder (n = 99, M age = 34.99, SD = 10.83, 66.7% female). Results: Results from the current study provide support for AS as a potential vulnerability factor for COVID-19-related mental health problems across both samples, and these effects were evident over and above the variance accounted for by age, sex, pre-existing medical conditions, and COVID-19 exposure. Conclusions: These data identify AS as a potential intervention target to reduce COVID-19 mental health burden among adults in Argentina.","Rogers, Andrew H; Bogiaizian, Daniel; Salazar, Patricio López; Solari, Adrian; Garey, Lorra; Fogle, Brienna M; Schmidt, Norman B; Zvolensky, Michael J",Cognit Ther Res,368,32

The success of delivering mass vaccination, on the scale of what would be applied to contain COVID-19, largely depends on the compliance of the public to programs mandated by public health officials. This study was aimed to evaluate the perception and possible hesitance of people in Jordan toward a tentative COVID-19 vaccine using self-administrated online survey. During the study period, a total of 1287 agreed to participate in the study. More than half of the participants (n = 734, 57%) were females and the majority (n = 893, 69%) had a University degree. Most of the participants (n = 871, 68%) believed that scientists have adequate tools to develop a safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccine and two-third of them (n = 861, 67%) believed that developing vaccines would end the pandemic. However, around half of them (n = 665, 52%) reported not having adequate information on the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination. Preference of study participants to achieve immunity against COVID-19 using natural way was the most commonly reported reason to refuse vaccination (n = 826, 64%), followed by their concern about adverse effects associated with the vaccine (n = 781, 61%). In conclusion, the sampled participants showed an overall positive attitude toward receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Educational campaigns using television and social media are recommended to better inform the public of the benefits of COVID-19 vaccine in reaching a ""herd immunity"" based strategy to control the current pandemic.","Abu Farha, Rana K; Alzoubi, Karem H; Khabour, Omar F; Alfaqih, Mahmoud A",Hum Vaccin Immunother,368,16

METHODS: We reviewed ten weeks of press releases from the Uganda Ministry of Health from the day when the first case was announced, March 22, through May 29, 2020. We obtained the press releases from the MoH website and the Twitter handle (@MinofHealthUG). Data include the number of persons tested and the categories were classified as international arrivals, community members, and long-distance truck drivers. RESULTS: The first cases were international arrivals from Asia and Europe, and after that, community cases emerged. However, in the middle of April 2020, COVID-19 cases were detected among long-distance truck drivers. By May 29, 2020, 89, 224 persons had been tested; overall, 442 tested positive. Of those that tested positive, the majority, or 317 (71.8%) were truck drivers, 75 (16.9%) were community cases, and 50 (11.3%) were international arrivals. The majority of community cases have been linked to contact with truck drivers. CONCLUSIONS: Truck drivers were the most frequently diagnosed category, and have become a core group for COVID-19 in Uganda.

Therefore, during the different waves of the COVID-19 pandemic we have to face the problems of how to perform elective cardiac invasive procedures in non-COVID patients and which patients/procedures should be prioritised. In this context, the interplay between the pandemic stage, the availability of healthcare resources and the priority of specific cardiac disorders is crucial. Clear pathways for ""hot"" or presumed ""hot"" patients and ""cold"" patients are mandatory in each hospital. Depending on the local testing capacity and intensity of transmission in the area, healthcare facilities may test patients for SARS-CoV-2 infection before the interventional procedure, regardless of risk assessment for COVID-19. Pre-hospital testing should always be conducted in the presence of symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In cases of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 positive patients, full personal protective equipment using FFP 2/N95 masks, eye protection, gowning and gloves is indicated during cardiac interventions for healthcare workers.

However, building a robust image classification model for datasets with data irregularity or imbalanced classes can be a very challenging task, especially in the medical imaging domain. In this article, we propose a novel deep convolutional neural network, which we called self-supervised super sample decomposition for transfer learning (4S-DT) model. The 4S-DT encourages a coarse-to-fine transfer learning from large-scale image recognition tasks to a specific chest X-ray image classification task using a generic self-supervised sample decomposition approach. Our main contribution is a novel self-supervised learning mechanism guided by a super sample decomposition of unlabeled chest X-ray images. 4S-DT helps in improving the robustness of knowledge transformation via a downstream learning strategy with a class-decomposition (CD) layer to simplify the local structure of the data. The 4S-DT can deal with any irregularities in the image dataset by investigating its class boundaries using a downstream CD mechanism. We used 50,000 unlabeled chest X-ray images to achieve our coarse-to-fine transfer learning with an application to COVID-19 detection, as an exemplar. The 4S-DT has achieved a high accuracy of 99.8% on the larger of the two datasets used in the experimental study and an accuracy of 97.54% on the smaller dataset, which was enriched by augmented images, out of which all real COVID-19 cases were detected.","Abbas, Asmaa; Abdelsamea, Mohammed M; Gaber, Mohamed Medhat",IEEE trans. neural netw. learn. syst.

From 97 cases with all four samples, there were 24 with at least one positive result for viral infection. Some cases had multiple positive results and a total of 27 respiratory tract viruses were identified, of which rhinovirus, influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus were the most common. Seventeen of the 27 viral infections (63%) were identified in all four samples. However, in nearly all cases (96%) the nasopharyngeal swab detected the infective agent when the multiplex PCR panel had detected infection in any of the four sample types. A nasopharyngeal swab is considered to be an optimal sample for detection of respiratory tract viral infection.

The study aims to assess patients' perception on risks associated with hypertension. Design and method: Hypertension patients visiting the emergency (non-COVID) department or the outpatient clinics of a tertiary hospital in Northern Greece were invited to participate by completing a short questionnaire. This observational study was conducted during the first and the much more forceful ongoing second wave. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) were used to measure the frequency and severity of depression and anxiety. Results: 373 hypertensive patients (205 women, 55.0%) participated (mean age 63.6±9.4 years), with 341 (91.4%) taking RAAS-i. About half (191, 51.2%) were taking RAAS-i for hypertension, while the rest for other indications. The vast majority (364, 97.6%) were alert that hypertension was a risk factor for COVID-19, although only 1 in 8 were informed that it mainly implied uncontrolled/untreated hypertension. Most of the patients (347, 93.0%) had heard that antihypertensive drugs might be harmful (mainly from TV reports), though only 199 (58.4%) of the patients taking RAAS-i knew they were taking such drugs. Moreover, 176 patients (47.2%), mostly during second wave, conducted their doctor and eventually 17 altered therapy. Participants during second wave reported higher chances of getting COVID-19, with the majority believing they are more susceptible and expecting more severe disease. The mean Beck's anxiety and depression score was 10.7 ± 7.1 and 12.2 ± 9.3 respectively, with the prevalence of significant anxiety (BAI&gt;=10) or depression (BDI&gt;=17) reaching 11% (41 patients) and 6.2% (23 patients), with as expected, higher scores for second wave patients. Disturbingly, only 20 patients (5.4%) had been informed of the position of major scientific. Conclusions: Greek patients are concerned of hypertension association with COVID-19 although not properly informed that it implies mainly uncontrolled/ untreated hypertension.

Although global supply chains have been affected by the general lockdown, due to their particular characteristics, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have been hit most severely by the measures implemented to prevent the spread of the virus. This study aims to determine how these firms coped with the disruption caused by the closure, in terms of population and their daily lives to carry out their economic activities. For this purpose, a qualitative methodology (descriptive and inductive) was used through the use of snowball sampling with a questionnaire in Portugal during the lockdown. The results obtained show that SMEs face a series of difficulties from interrupting their operations, which has caused serious liquidity problems, with effects on their future continuity and maintaining jobs. Additionally, it showed the importance of government measures to support these firms today and in the future, although the number of firms adhering to them is considerably affected by the eligibility criteria and the speed of institutions’ response. The main contribution of this research lies in confirming that the weaknesses in SMEs are the principal obstacle to a resilient response to this crisis, such as their limited liquidity, human resources, digitalization, and use of information technology. These weaknesses and/or threats had already been indicated in the various theoretical currents stemming from Organizational Theory, so the originality of this contribution lies in the fact that the managers of these SMEs are endowed with other skills and characteristics, such as, for example, dynamic capacities to manage business in an unparalleled crisis and to continue their operations, even when faced with a global blockage. Implications for theory and practice, limitations, and suggestions for future research are also presented.","Rodrigues, Margarida Franco Mário Sousa Nuno Silva Rui",Sustainability,368,1

Disease severity is associated with age and comorbidities. Understanding of viral infectious mechanisms, and antibody immune response, can help to better control disease progression. SARS-CoV-2 has a major impact on the Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone System (RAAS), through its binding to the membrane cellular glycoprotein, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme-2 (ACE-2), then infecting cells for replication. This report hypothesizes the possible implication of an autoimmune response, induced by generation of allo- or autoantibodies to ACE-2, or to its complexes with viral spike protein.

Yet the scarcity of knowledge on the dynamics of the immune response to infection has led to hesitation on recommending the use of rapid immunodiagnostic tests, even though rapid serology tests are commercially available and scalable. On the basis of our knowledge and understanding of viral infectivity and host response, we urge countries without the capacity to do molecular testing at scale to research the use of serology tests to triage symptomatic patients in community settings, to test contacts of confirmed cases, and in situational analysis and surveillance. The WHO R&D Blue Print expert group identified eight priorities for research and development, of which the highest is to mobilise research on rapid point-of-care diagnostics for use at the community level. This research should inform control programmes of the required performance and utility of rapid serology tests, which, when applied specifically for appropriate public health measures to then be put in place, can make a huge difference.","Peeling, Rosanna W; Wedderburn, Catherine J; Garcia, Patricia J; Boeras, Debrah; Fongwen, Noah; Nkengasong, John; Sall, Amadou; Tanuri, Amilcar; Heymann, David L",Lancet Infect Dis,368,7

With so much uncertainty about the future of travel, the transportation sector needs to move rapidly to shape the nature of public transit and shared mobility services during the COVID-19 recovery period. Consequently, the University of California Institute of Transportation Studies (UC ITS) and the Transportation Research Board’s (TRB) Executive Committee launched a scenario planning exercise from June to September 2020 involving 36 transportation experts. The exercise resulted in a series of policy options and research directions across three timeframes (i.e., within 12 months, one to three years, four to six years) that could guide the recovery of the public transit and shared mobility industries. This report offers several key takeaways. First, external forces beyond COVID-19 (e.g., economy, political will, etc.) will significantly drive the future of public transit and shared mobility and determine the effectiveness and feasibility of any policy strategies. Second, while public transit and shared mobility face a dire future in the short run, steps can be taken immediately to reduce the effects of the current crisis, while also laying the groundwork for more sustainable transportation in the future beyond COVID-19. Actions taken to only address the current crisis will not prepare public transit and shared mobility for the future. Finally, future policies and actions will not be effective without in-depth analysis and development. Research and lessons learned from demonstration and pilot projects will be critical for crafting policies, identifying all positive and negative outcomes, and shaping actions toward a future transportation system that is more resilient, socially equitable, and environmentally friendly.","Shaheen, Susan Wong Stephen University of California Berkeley University of California Institute of Transportation Studies",,368,1

This extended duration of prone positioning puts patients at risk of developing orbital compartment syndrome if direct pressure to the orbit and the globe occurs and concomitant protection of the eyes is not undertaken. Objective: To report 2 cases of orbital compartment syndrome, as well as optic disc edema and retinal hemorrhages, in the setting of prolonged prone positioning of patients in the intensive care unit during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: The cases took place from April 27, 2020, to May 4, 2020, at a COVID-19 intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital. Four of 16 patients in the intensive care unit required prolonged prone-position ventilation. A bedside eye examination was performed on 4 selected patients due to the observed presence of substantial periorbital edema. Main Outcomes and Measures: Intraocular pressures and fundus findings of 4 patients with periorbital edema. Results: Two of 4 patients who were in the prone position for extended periods of time had bilateral fundoscopic findings of optic disc edema and retinal hemorrhages, possibly consistent with a papillophlebitis. Additionally, both patients had a substantial increase in intraocular pressure of 2- to 3-fold in the prone position compared with the supine position. Conclusions and Relevance: Prolonged prone positioning of patients with COVID-19 can be associated with elevated intraocular pressure from periorbital edema, direct compression on the eye, and increased orbital venous pressure. Orbital compartment syndrome can be avoided by the use of protective cushioning around the eyes and maintaining the patient's head position above heart level during prone positioning. Patients with COVID-19 may also develop papillophlebitis with optic disc edema and retinal hemorrhages, which may be associated with a hypercoagulable state caused by COVID-19. These observations suggest awareness for the possible presence of these ophthalmic findings while treating severely ill patients with COVID-19.","Sun, Lucy; Hymowitz, Maggie; Pomeranz, Howard D",JAMA ophthalmol.

In hospital settings, the possibility of airborne transmission needs to be investigated thoroughly. MATERIALS AND METHODS: There was a nosocomial outbreak of COVID-19 in a hematologic ward in a tertiary hospital, Seoul, Korea. We found 11 patients and guardians with COVID-19 through vigorous contact tracing and closed-circuit television monitoring. We found one patient who probably had acquired COVID-19 through airborne-transmission. We performed airflow investigation with simulation software, whole-genome sequencing of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). RESULTS: Of the nine individuals with COVID-19 who had been in the hematologic ward, six stayed in one multi-patient room (Room 36), and other three stayed in different rooms (Room 1, 34, 35). Guardian in room 35 was close contact to cases in room 36, and patient in room 34 used the shared bathroom for teeth brushing 40 minutes after index used. Airflow simulation revealed that air was spread from the bathroom to the adjacent room 1 while patient in room 1 did not used the shared bathroom. Airflow was associated with poor ventilation in shared bathroom due to dysfunctioning air-exhaust, grill on the door of shared bathroom and the unintended negative pressure of adjacent room. CONCLUSION: Transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the hematologic ward occurred rapidly in the multi-patient room and shared bathroom settings. In addition, there was a case of possible airborne transmission due to unexpected airflow.","Jung, Jiwon; Lee, Jungmin; Jo, Seongmin; Bae, Seongman; Kim, Ji Yeun; Cha, Hye Hee; Lim, Young Ju; Kwak, Sun Hee; Hong, Min Jee; Kim, Eun Ok; Bae, Joon Yong; Kang, Changmin; Sung, Minki; Park, Man Seong; Kim, Sung Han",Infect Chemother,368,1

Our objective was to conduct a systematic review of the safety of vaccines recommended for children, adults, and pregnant women in the United States. METHODS: We searched the literature in November 2020 to update a 2014 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality review by integrating newly available data. Studies of vaccines that used a comparator and reported the presence or absence of key adverse events were eligible. Adhering to Evidence-based Practice Center methodology, we assessed the strength of evidence (SoE) for all evidence statements. The systematic review is registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020180089). RESULTS: Of 56,603 reviewed citations, 338 studies reported in 518 publications met inclusion criteria. For children, SoE was high for no increased risk of autism following measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. SoE was high for increased risk of febrile seizures with MMR. There was no evidence of increased risk of intussusception with rotavirus vaccine at the latest follow-up (moderate SoE), nor of diabetes (high SoE). There was no evidence of increased risk or insufficient evidence for key adverse events for newer vaccines such as 9-valent human papillomavirus and meningococcal B vaccines. For adults, there was no evidence of increased risk (varied SoE) or insufficient evidence for key adverse events for the new adjuvanted inactivated influenza vaccine and recombinant adjuvanted zoster vaccine. We found no evidence of increased risk (varied SoE) for key adverse events among pregnant women following tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine, including stillbirth (moderate SoE). CONCLUSIONS: Across a large body of research we found few associations of vaccines and serious key adverse events; however, rare events are challenging to study. Any adverse events should be weighed against the protective benefits that vaccines provide.","Gidengil, Courtney; Goetz, Matthew Bidwell; Newberry, Sydne; Maglione, Margaret; Hall, Owen; Larkin, Jody; Motala, Aneesa; Hempel, Susanne",Vaccine,368,22

METHODS: We used California (CA) surveillance data to describe trends in case reporting for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis of any stage in the pre- versus post-COVID-19 eras (January-June 2019 and January-June 2020). We also analyzed data from an electronic survey administered by the CA STD Control Branch to local health jurisdictions in April, June, and September of 2020, assessing the impact of COVID-19 on STD programs. RESULTS: There were sharp declines in cases of all reportable bacterial STDs occurring in conjunction with the March 19, 2020 CA stay-at-home order, most of which did not return to baseline by July. Comparing January-June 2020 to January-June of 2019, there were decreases in reported cases of chlamydia (31%), late syphilis (19%), primary/secondary syphilis (15%), early nonprimary nonsecondary syphilis (14%), and gonorrhea (13%). The largest percentage declines in STD case reporting were among Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Black persons. Seventy-eight percent of local health jurisdiction respondents indicated that half or more of their workforce had been redeployed to COVID-19 by September 2020. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 era, STD case reporting and programmatic functions have diminished throughout CA. Because this may contribute to decreases or delays in STD diagnosis and treatment-with resultant increases in STD transmission-providers and public health officials should prepare for potential increases in STD-related morbidity in the months and years to come.","Johnson, Kelly A; Burghardt, Nicole O; Tang, Eric C; Long, Pike; Plotzker, Rosalyn; Gilson, Denise; Murphy, Ryan; Jacobson, Kathleen",Sex Transm Dis,368,16

The proteases that mediate entry differ between cell lines, and it is currently unclear which proteases are relevant in vivo. A remarkable feature of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike is the presence of a multibasic cleavage site (MBCS), which is absent in the SARS-CoV spike. Here, we report that the SARS-CoV-2 spike MBCS increases infectivity on human airway organoids (hAOs). Compared with SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 entered faster into Calu-3 cells and, more frequently, formed syncytia in hAOs. Moreover, the MBCS increased entry speed and plasma membrane serine protease usage relative to cathepsin-mediated endosomal entry. Blocking serine proteases, but not cathepsins, effectively inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication in hAOs. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 enters relevant airway cells using serine proteases, and suggest that the MBCS is an adaptation to this viral entry strategy.","Mykytyn, Anna Z; Breugem, Tim I; Riesebosch, Samra; Schipper, Debby; van den Doel, Petra B; Rottier, Robbert J; Lamers, Mart M; Haagmans, Bart L",eLife (Cambridge),368,22

The newly synthesized TiO2-NPs (nanotubes) were characterized by chemical spectroscopic analysis Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and ultraviolet FT-IR and UV. The chemical purity and Zeta potential distribution of the TiO2-NPs (nanotubes) were evaluated to confirm their nano-range, and their surface morphology was determined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM), and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX). The antiviral activity of the TiO2-NPs (nanotubes) against SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated using 10% (Dimethyl sulfoxide) DMSO and dist.H2O using a cytotoxicity assay and inhibitory concentration assay (to determine the cytotoxic half concentration CC50 and half maximal inhibitory concentration IC50). The current results confirmed that TiO2-NPs exhibit strong anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity at very low cytotoxic concentrations in vitro with a non-significant selectivity index (CC50/IC50 ≤ 1). The obtained results indicate that TiO2-NPs and nanotubes have potent antiviral activity at a very low concentrations (IC50 = 568.6 ng/mL), with a weak cytotoxic effect on the cellular host (CC50 = 399.1 ng/mL). Thus, we highly recommend the use of TiO2-NPs (nanotubes) in vitro and in wall coatings as a potent disinfectant to combat SARS-CoV-2 with little irritation of the cellular hosts. Furthermore, we also recommend more and excessive prospective studies on the complexation of natural active or natural compounds with TiO2-NPs (nanotubes) to minimize their cytotoxicity, enhance their antiviral activity, and increase their inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.","Hamza, Reham Z.; Gobouri, Adil A.; Al-Yasi, Hatim M.; Al-Talhi, Tarek A.; El-Megharbel, Samy M.",Coatings,368,16

METHODS: We performed a realist synthesis and meta-narrative review extracting data in English, French, German and Thai from PubMed/Medline, Embase, Biomed Central, Cochrane Library, and Thai Journals Online, until 1 January 2021. The primary outcome variable was CMF manifestations grouped into 5 categories: (1) mouth and throat, (2) nose, paranasal sinus, and skull base (3) ocular/orbital and periorbital tissue, (4) ear, and (5) craniofacial skin. Appropriate statistics was computed. RESULTS: Thirty-seven original articles meeting the inclusion criteria were analysed; all were in English and indexed in PubMed/Medline. Hand searches of their references yielded a total of 101 articles for the review. Most data were in low level of evidence and focused on smell and taste disturbances and non-specific orofacial lesions. Iatrogenic complications may occur in this body region. Conservative measures remained effective and were usually enough for patient care. CONCLUSION: Because SARS-CoV-2 infection is new and becomes the stringent worldwide pandemic within a short time period, most of the data on CMF symptoms are of low level evidence. Apart from taste and smell dysfunctions, non-specific CMF lesions can be found and treated conservatively. Treatment complications are possible.

Exosomes are small lipid bilayer particles released by cells with pleiotropic functions that have been reported to regulate the complex intracellular pathway involved in all steps of breast cancer development-from initiation to progression toward a metastatic dissemination. Particularly, the role of these microvesicles has been explored in metastasis, which represents the leading cause of breast cancer morbidity and mortality worldwide. Reports highlight that the plasticity of breast cancer cells, fundamental for the establishment of distant metastasis, may be in part attributed to exosome-carried signals shared between adjacent cells and long-distance cells in the body. In the present review, we will discuss the functions of exosomes in the metastatic breast cancer process and secondary site outgrowth. The possibility to decode the exosome functions in advanced diseases may offer new opportunities for early detection, molecular targeted therapies and exosome-based therapeutics in breast cancer.","Giordano, Cinzia; La Camera, Giusi; Gelsomino, Luca; Barone, Ines; Bonofiglio, Daniela; Andò, Sebastiano; Catalano, Stefania",,368,30

The level of awareness and knowledge of the disease as well as the related attitude and practice amongst hospital workers could determine its extent of control. The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge, attitude and practices amongst hospital staff regarding COVID-19. Methods: this cross-sectional study was conducted among staff of the Niger Delta University Teaching Hospital, Bayelsa State, Nigeria. A self-administered semi-structured questionnaire was adapted in assessing their knowledge, attitude and practice towards COVID-19. Results: one hundred and twenty four respondents completed the study with a mean age of 30.9 ± 6.5 years. Up to 90% of them demonstrated good knowledge of COVID-19 with regard to preventive and control measures. Approximately 90% of them practiced good hand hygiene though a lesser proportion wore face masks (51.6%) and practiced crowd avoidance (58.1%). Medical doctors had a marginally higher practice score compared with ""others"" (p = 0,047). Up to 98(79.0%) of respondents were scared of self-infection and 99(79.8%) were not motivated to work due to inadequate facilities, equipment and resources in 50% of cases. Knowledge of COVID-19 was positively correlated with the practices of the participants (p = 0.023). Conclusion: the hospital staff lacked adequate motivation towards management of COVID-19 and were constrained for the fear of self- infection, inadequate equipment, resources and equipment despite possessing a good knowledge of the disease. There is need for concerted efforts by stakeholders in the health care industry to ensure hospital workers are adequately motivated and provided with the needed risk protection devices and resources during this pandemic.","Egbi, Oghenekaro Godwin; Duru, Chika; Kasia, Benedicta",Pan Afr Med J,368,16

To track the emergence as well as the persistence of mutations during the early stage of the pandemic, a comparative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 whole proteome sequences has been performed by considering manually curated 31,389 whole genome sequences from 84 countries. Among the 7 highly recurring (percentage frequency&#8805;10%) mutations (Nsp2:T85I, Nsp6:L37F, Nsp12:P323L, Spike:D614G, ORF3a:Q57H, N protein:R203K and N protein:G204R), N protein:R203K and N protein: G204R are co-occurring (dependent) mutations. Nsp12:P323L and Spike:D614G often appear simultaneously. The highly recurring Spike:D614G, Nsp12:P323L and Nsp6:L37F as well as moderately recurring (percentage frequency between &#8805;1 and <10%) ORF3a:G251V and ORF8:L84S mutations have led to4 major clades in addition to a clade that lacks high recurring mutations. Further, the occurrence of ORF3a:Q57H&Nsp2:T85I, ORF3a:Q57H and N protein:R203K&G204R along with Nsp12:P323L&Spike:D614G has led to 3 additional sub-clades. Similarly, occurrence of Nsp6:L37F and ORF3a:G251V together has led to the emergence of a sub-clade. Nonetheless, ORF8:L84S does not occur along with ORF3a:G251V or Nsp6:L37F. Intriguingly, ORF3a:G251V and ORF8:L84S are found to occur independent of Nsp12:P323L and Spike:D614G mutations. These clades have evolved during the early stage of the pandemic and have disseminated across several countries. Further, Nsp10 is found to be highly resistant to mutations, thus, it can be exploited for drug/vaccine development and the corresponding gene sequence can be used for the diagnosis. Concisely, the study reports the SARS-CoV-2 antigens diversity across the globe during the early stage of the pandemic and facilitates the understanding of viral evolution.","Patro, L Ponoop Prasad; Sathyaseelan, Chakkarai; Uttamrao, Patil Pranita; Rathinavelan, Thenmalarchelvi",Infect Genet Evol,368,24

NHE activity increases in response to a decrease in intracellular pH, and it maintains intracellular pH in a narrow range. Patients with obesity, diabetes, and hypertension and the elderly are prone to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. The angiotensin II (Ang II) level is high in chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Ang II is the main stimulator of NHE, and an increased Ang II level causes prolonged NHE activation in these patients. The long-term increase in NHE activity causes H+ ions to leave the cell in patients with diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Increasing H+ ions outside the cell lead to an increase in oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species. H+ ion flows into the cell due to the increased oxidative stress. This vicious circle causes intracellular pH to drop. Although NHE is activated when intracellular pH decreases, there is prolonged NHE activation in chronic diseases such as aforementioned. Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) progression may be more severe and mortal in these patients. SARS-CoV-2 readily invades the cell at low intracellular pH and causes infection. The renin-angiotensin system and NHE play a vital role in regulating intracellular pH. The reduction of NHE activity or its prolonged activation may cause susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection by lowering intracellular pH in patients with diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Prolonged NHE activation in these patients with COVID-19 may worsen the course of the disease. Scientists continue to investigate the mechanism of the disease and the factors that affect its clinical progression.","Cumhur Cure, Medine; Cure, Erkan",J Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone Syst,368,20

COVID-19 and pulmonary embolism (PE) are both associated with tachypnoea, hypoxemia, dyspnoea, and increased D-dimer. Diagnosis of pulmonary embolism in a patient with COVID-19 compared to an individual without it, using the conventional clinical and biochemical evidence is challenging and somehow impossible. In this study, we reported four male cases affected by COVID-19 and admitted to hospitals in Sanandaj, Iran. The patients were all older adults (ranging between 56 and 95 years of age). Fever, chills, muscle pain, and cough were evident in all the cases. Red blood cell levels were low, and pulmonary embolism was clearly detected on spiral computed tomographic (CT) angiography of the pulmonary circulation of all patients. These cases demonstrated that COVID-19 may lead to pulmonary embolism by causing blood coagulation problems. As COVID-19 continues to cause considerable mortality, more information is emerging which reveals its complicated pathogenicity. In the meantime, venous thromboembolism remains an uncommon finding in patients with COVID-19. It is essential that health care providers perform the necessary diagnostic evaluations and provide appropriate treatment for patients.","Hesam-Shariati, S.; Fatehi, P.; Abouzaripour, M.; Fathi, F.; Hesam-Shariati, N.; Hesam Shariati, M.

The reports of confirmed COVID-19 cases based on molecular tests do not completely cover the total number of infected people. These reports do not include the asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients and also the patients with false-negative RT-PCR results, while the infection is contagious in all of these conditions. ObjectiveIn this study, we tried to improve our conception of the hidden perspective of SARS-CoV-2 in epidemiological reports. MethodsFrom May 30 to June 17, 2020, blood samples were collected from two groups of people: asymptomatic or mild symptomatic volunteer participants and severe symptomatic hospitalized patients with negative PCR results. Detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibody was done with ELISA kit targeting N or S proteins. ResultsTotally 716 samples from volunteer participants and 81 samples from symptomatic hospitalized patients with negative PCR were evaluated. The test performance-adjusted seroprevalence (95% CI) of SARS-CoV-2 anti-N IgG was 17.3% (8.8%, 25.8%) for volunteers and 25.5% (12.8%, 39.7%) for anti-N and S IgM in hospitalized group. There was an association between high-risk occupations, high-risk behaviors, or symptomatic diseases with positive SARA-Cov-2 N antibody results. Among anti-N positive infected individuals, 49.2% (21.4%, 78.8%) were anti-S positive. ConclusionThe results showed that SARS-COV-2 infection occurs in asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals, but in more than half of them, the produced antibody is not protective. Findings of hospitalized patients also showed that the combination of IgM assay with real-time PCR improves the detection of the disease by more than 25% in negative molecular cases.","Hajiahmadi, Nazila; mojtahedzade, Faezeh; Yari, Atefeh; Tat, Mahdi; Soleimanjahi, Hoorieh; Jamehdar, Saeid Amel; Jafari, Mitra; Asli, Samira; Dorostkar, Rohollah; Nazemipour, Maryam; Mansournia, Mohammad Ali; Bamdad, Taravat",,368,20

We aimed to examine the use of rapid SARS-CoV-2 sequencing combined with detailed epidemiological analysis to investigate health-care associated SARS-CoV-2 infections and inform infection control measures. METHODS: In this prospective surveillance study, we set up rapid SARS-CoV-2 nanopore sequencing from PCR-positive diagnostic samples collected from our hospital (Cambridge, UK) and a random selection from hospitals in the East of England, enabling sample-to-sequence in less than 24 h. We established a weekly review and reporting system with integration of genomic and epidemiological data to investigate suspected health-care associated COVID-19 cases. FINDINGS: Between March 13 and April 24, 2020, we collected clinical data and samples from 5613 patients with COVID-19 from across the East of England. We sequenced 1000 samples producing 747 high-quality genomes. We combined epidemiological and genomic analysis of the 299 patients from our hospital and identified 35 clusters of identical viruses involving 159 patients. 92 (58%) of 159 patients had strong epidemiological links and 32 (20%) patients had plausible epidemiological links. These results were fed back to clinical, infection control, and hospital management teams, leading to infection-control interventions and informing patient safety reporting. INTERPRETATION: We established real-time genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in a UK hospital and showed the benefit of combined genomic and epidemiological analysis for the investigation of health-care associated COVID-19. This approach enabled us to detect cryptic transmission events and identify opportunities to target infection-control interventions to further reduce health-care associated infections. Our findings have important implications for national public health policy as they enable rapid tracking and investigation of infections in hospital and community settings.

We examined the association between male sex and severe Covid-19 infection and if an increased risk remains after adjustment for age and comorbidities. METHODS: Nationwide register-based follow-up study of Covid-19 patients in Denmark until May 16, 2020. Average risk ratio comparing 30-day composite outcome of all-cause death, severe Covid-19 diagnosis or intensive care unit (ICU) admission for men versus women standardized to the age and comorbidity distribution of all patients were derived from multivariable Cox regression. Included covariates were age, hypertension, diagnoses including obesity, alcohol, sleep apnea, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, previous myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic heart disease (IHD), heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AF), stroke, peripheral artery disease, cancer, liver-, rheumatic-, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). RESULTS: Of 4,842 Covid-19 patients, 2,281 (47.1%) were men. Median age was 57 [25%-75% 43-73] for men versus 52 [38-71] for women (P<0.001); however, octogenarians had equal sex distribution. Alcohol diagnosis, diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea, prior MI and IHD (all P<0.001) as well as AF, stroke and HF (all P=0.01) were more often seen in men, and so was CKD (P=0.03). Obesity diagnosis (P<0.001) were more often seen in women. Other comorbidity differences were insignificant (P>0.05). The fully adjusted average risk ratio was 1.63 [95% CI 1.44-1.84]. CONCLUSIONS: Men with Covid-19 infection have >50% higher risk of all-cause death, severe Covid-19 infection, or ICU admission than women.

DATA SOURCES: A search of EMBASE, PubMed, and Google Scholar (January 1990 to May 2021), limited to the English language, using applicable search terms resulted in 137 articles, with 21 relevant articles included. Regulatory agency and clinical guidance documents were also reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Included articles describe in vitro or in vivo animal or human data for dexamethasone induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 or P-glycoprotein (P-gp). DATA SYNTHESIS: Dexamethasone has the potential to interact with the DOACs via CYP3A4 and/or P-gp induction. Only apixaban and rivaroxaban have CYP3A4 metabolism. Dexamethasone can increase CYP3A4 activity by up to 70% and reduce the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) of CYP3A4 substrates by >40%, which is consistent with criteria for a weak CYP inducer. In rodents, dexamethasone P-gp induction is associated with AUC reductions of 20% to 50%. Human data are lacking. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: Severe COVID-19 infection is associated with hypercoagulability. Although heparins are the preferred anticoagulants for hospitalized COVID-19 patients, DOACs are being utilized. Dexamethasone is recommended for hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen. The concurrent use of dexamethasone and apixaban or rivaroxaban in such patients carries the potential for reduced anticoagulant effect during a state of heightened thrombotic risk. CONCLUSIONS: Concurrent use of dexamethasone and apixaban or rivaroxaban in hospitalized COVID-19 patients with laboratory evidence of COVID coagulopathy should be avoided until higher-quality data are available.","Smythe, Maureen A; Burns, Carly; Liu, Qianyue; Garwood, Candice L",Ann Pharmacother,368,24

Thus, the study aimed to evaluate the characteristics of pediatric patients with type 1 diabetes hospitalized during the first wave of the pandemic and the prevalence of new onset diabetes among patients with evidence of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A single-center surveillance study included all patients with diabetes admitted to Children's Hospital, Ain Shams University, in Egypt between May to August 2020. Data were collected to evaluate patients' clinical and laboratory characteristics as well as their outcomes. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients were admitted during the study period. The mean age was 8.4 ± 3.8 years. Patients presented late to the emergency department with a mean delay of 3.05 ± 1.19 days from onset of symptoms. 34/36 patients presented in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), 50% presenting in severe DKA. Almost 81% of the patients were newly diagnosed. During the study period, SARS-CoV-2 PCR was found positive in four patients, COVID Ig M antibodies were positive in another two patients; all were symptomatic requiring ICU admission. Four patients showed a picture suggestive of the multi-inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C); cardiac affection was a constant feature. CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic affected both the prevalence and severity of DKA among pediatric patients. The increased prevalence of severe DKA could be partly related to delayed hospital admission or the effect of COVID-19 in triggering DKA. Efforts should be done to continuously raise awareness about diabetes in children as well as the importance of seeking timely medical guidance.","Sherif, Eman Monir; Elhenawy, Yasmine Ibrahim; Matter, Randa Mahmoud; Aly, Hanan Hassan; Thabet, Rasha Adel; Fereig, Yasmeen Abdelaziz",,368,1

The coronavirus crisis has affected many sectors in Romania, some companies diminishing or even ceasing their activity. Making forecasts of the unemployment rate has a fundamental impact and importance on future social policy strategies. The aim of the paper is to comparatively analyze the forecast performances of different univariate time series methods with the purpose of providing future predictions of unemployment rate. In order to do that, several forecasting models (seasonal model autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA), self-exciting threshold autoregressive (SETAR), Holt-Winters, ETS (error, trend, seasonal), and NNAR (neural network autoregression)) have been applied, and their forecast performances have been evaluated on both the in-sample data covering the period January 2000-December 2017 used for the model identification and estimation and the out-of-sample data covering the last three years, 2018-2020. The forecast of unemployment rate relies on the next two years, 2021-2022. Based on the in-sample forecast assessment of different methods, the forecast measures root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percent error (MAPE) suggested that the multiplicative Holt-Winters model outperforms the other models. For the out-of-sample forecasting performance of models, RMSE and MAE values revealed that the NNAR model has better forecasting performance, while according to MAPE, the SARIMA model registers higher forecast accuracy. The empirical results of the Diebold-Mariano test at one forecast horizon for out-of-sample methods revealed differences in the forecasting performance between SARIMA and NNAR, of which the best model of modeling and forecasting unemployment rate was considered to be the NNAR model.","Davidescu, Adriana AnaMaria; Apostu, Simona-Andreea; Paul, Andreea",,368,12

METHOD: In this prospective study consecutive patients hospitalized in non-intensive care units with diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia and D-dimerâ¯>â¯1000â¯ng/ml were screened for asymptomatic DVT with complete compression doppler ultrasound (CCUS). The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. RESULTS: The study comprised 156 patients (65.4% male). All but three patients received standard doses of thromboprophylaxis. Median days of hospitalization until CCUS was 9 (IQR 5-17). CCUS was positive for DVT in 23 patients (14.7%), of whom only one was proximal DVT. Seven patients (4.5%) had bilateral distal DVT.

In this study, we explore the dynamic alternation in the levels of SDC-1 in cases with COVID-19. A total of 120 cases definitely diagnosed with COVID-19 were admitted to the Firoozgar Hospital, Tehran, Iran, from December 1, 2020, to January 29, 2021, and included in our study. Also, 58 healthy subjects (HS) were chosen as the control group. Patients were classified into two groups: 1) ICU patients and (63 cases) 2) non-ICU patients (57 cases). The dynamic changes of serum SCD-1, CRP, IL-6, IL-10, IL-18, and Vit D levels a well as the disease activity were investigated in three-time points (T1-T3). Our results indicated that the COVID-19 patients had significantly increased SCD-1, CRP, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-18 levels than in HS, while the Vit D levels in COVID-19 patients were significantly lower than HS. Further analysis demonstrated that the SCD-1, CRP, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-18 levels in ICU patients were significantly higher than in non-ICU patients. Tracking dynamic changes in the above markers indicated that on the day of admission, the SCD-1, CRP, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-18 levels were gradually increased on day 5 (T2) and then gradually decreased on day 10 (T3). ROC curve analysis suggests that markers mentioned above, SDC-1, IL-6, and IL-18 are valuable indicators in evaluating the activity of COVID-19. All in all, it seems that the serum SDC-1 levels alone or combined with other markers might be a good candidate for disease activity monitoring.","Karampoor, Sajad; Zahednasab, Hamid; Farahmand, Mohammad; Mirzaei, Rasoul; Zamani, Farhad; Tabibzadeh, Alireza; Bouzari, Behnaz; Ajdarkosh, Hossein; Nikkhah, Mehdi; Hashemi, Melika Razavi; Laali, Azadeh; Keyvani, Hossein",Int Immunopharmacol,368,24

There is an immediate need to develop a safe and efficient discharge process and recovery programme. Established rehabilitation programmes are well placed to deliver a programme for this group but will most likely need to be adapted for the post-COVID-19 population. The purpose of this survey was to rapidly identify the components of a post-COVID-19 rehabilitation assessment and elements of a successful rehabilitation programme that would be required to deliver a comprehensive service for those post-COVID-19 to inform service delivery. DESIGN: A survey comprising a series of closed questions and a free-text comment box allowing for a qualitative analysis. SETTING: Online survey. PARTICIPANTS: Multiprofessional clinicians across specialties were invited to take part. RESULTS: 1031 participants responded from a broad range of specialties. There was overwhelming support for an early posthospital discharge recovery programme to advise patients about the management of fatigue (95% agreed/strongly agreed), breathlessness (94%) and mood disturbances (including symptoms of anxiety and depression, 92%). At the time point of 6-8 weeks, an assessment was considered important, focusing on a broad range of possible symptoms and supporting a return to work. Recommendations for the intervention described a holistic programme focusing on symptom management, return of function and return to employment. The free-text comments added depth to the survey and the need 'not to reinvent the wheel' but rather adapt well-established rehabilitation services to individually tailor needs-based care with continued learning for service development. CONCLUSION: The responses indicate a huge interest and the urgent need to establish a programme to support and mitigate the long-term impact of COVID-19 by optimising and individualising existing rehabilitation programmes.","Singh, Sally J; Barradell, Amy C; Greening, Neil J; Bolton, Charlotte; Jenkins, Gisli; Preston, Louise; Hurst, John R",BMJ Open,368,1

DESIGN: A 48-year-old female university professor, gynecologist, and obstetrician with a history of laryngopharyngeal reflux and a left vocal polyp participated. Treatment was provided in 10 sessions. Pre- and post-treatment audio recordings of sustained vowels, selected sentences, and connected speech samples were submitted to auditory-perceptual and acoustical analysis to assess the effects of the two-treatment program. Also, laryngoscopic images, perceptions by the patient about her voice quality and quality of life before and after therapy were assessed. RESULTS: Improvements in acoustic parameters were obtained especially in perturbation and CCPS parameters. The overall voice quality scores on the CAPE-V were moderate before therapy and became mild after therapy. Laryngoscopy images demonstrated improvement in the glottis closure configuration in two phases (open and close) in pre- and post- CVM therapy and a decrease in polyp size. The patient had improvement in VAS, IVQLP, and VRQOL scores. CONCLUSION: The CVM therapy used in the study resulted in positive changes in acoustic and perceptual-auditory aspects of voice production, self-report, and QOL for the patient. The CVM approach appears to have been effective for this case in decreasing the polyp size or its regression or for vocal adaptation.","Dehqan, Ali",J. voice,368,10

While a terrible event, it can also be approached as offering a once-in-a-lifetime (hopefully) natural experiment. This is certainly true as far as the global pandemic applies to how and what we eat, given how it has radically altered many everyday food-related practices, whether due to supply chain failures or state-mandates (e.g., shelter-in-place orders). This paper is based on data collected pre- and post-outbreak, triangulating survey and qualitative data, in an attempt to further interrogate the concepts of ethical consumption and activism broadly defined, including the idea of consumer activism. With conceptual assistance from social practice theory, the paper interrogates certain long-standing questions in the literature, such as ethical consumption's link to other forms of political action. It also poses new ones, such as by disentangling the various ways individuals do (and do not do) ethical consumption. Finally, the data suggest tentative empirical and conceptual paths forward as we contemplate ethical consumption and social activism more generally in the shadow of COVID-19.","Carolan, Michael",Appetite,368,33

In India, the Rotavirus Vaccine (RVV) (2019) and the fractionated injectable polio vaccine (f-IPV) (2016) are more prone to wastage with high procurement costs. In this operational research study, we determined the effectiveness of a (self-designed) dose based reporting tool (DBRT) in reducing vaccine (f-IPV and RVV) wastage at primary care facilities in India during December 2019 to March' 2020. Data reports of all the immunization sessions conducted at three primary care facilities were analyzed to calculate the wastage rates of the RVV and the f-IPV for the following periods: (1). Period of initiation (August-November' 2019) (2). Pre-intervention with sensitization of healthcare providers (December' 2019-January' 2020) (3). Post-intervention after application of the DBRT. Intervention: The DBRT is a paper-based reporting format that assigns a unique code to each RVV and IPV vial. The health facility is required to report the total doses administered from each coded vial during every immunization session by updating it on the assigned reporting format. Pre-intervention, the average monthly wastage of f-IPV was 23.5% and of the RVV ranged from 18%-31%. Post-intervention, on using the DBRT, the monthly wastage of both RVV and f-IPV dropped significantly to 8.6% and 11.4%, respectively. During the subsequent month, the IPV wastage further decreased to only 4.7%. In conclusion, the DBRT reduces vaccine wastage in government primary care facilities by enabling a paper audit trail that promotes responsiveness and accountability among healthcare workers directly involved in vaccine administration.","Rustagi, Ruchir; Basu, Saurav; Sharma, Pragya; Sharma, Nandini",Hum Vaccin Immunother,368,21

The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of a multi-viral microbiological POCT for suspected respiratory tract infections (RTIs). METHODS: In this observational, mixed-methods feasibility study practices were provided with a POCT machine for any patient aged &#8805;3 months with suspected RTI. Dual throat/nose swabs tested for 17 respiratory viruses and three atypical bacteria, 65 minutes per sample. RESULTS: Twenty clinicians recruited 93 patients (estimated 1:3 of all RTI cases). Patient's median age was 29, 57% female, and 44% with co-morbidities. Pre-test diagnoses: upper RTI (48%); lower RTI (30%); viral/influenza-like illness (18%); other (4%). Median set-up time was 2.72 minutes, with 72% swabs processed <4 hours, 90% <24 hours. Tests detected &#8805;1 virus in 58%, no pathogen 37% and atypical bacteria 2% (3% inconclusive). Antibiotics were prescribed pre-test to 35% of patients with no pathogen detected and 25% with a virus. Post-test diagnoses changed in 20%, and diagnostic certainty increased (P = 0.02), more so when the test was positive rather than negative (P < 0.001). Clinicians predicted decreased antibiotic benefit post-test (P = 0.02). Interviews revealed the POCT has clear potential, was easy to use and well-liked, but limited by time-to-result and the absence of testing for typical respiratory bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: This POCT was acceptable and appeared to influence clinical reasoning. Clinicians wanted faster time-to-results and more information about bacteria. Randomized trials are needed to understand the safety, efficacy and patient perceptions of these POCTs.","Khalid, Tanzeela Y; Duncan, Lorna J; Thornton, Hannah V; Lasseter, Gemma; Muir, Peter; Toney, Zara Abigail; Hay, Alastair D",,368,30

Population demographics in the UAE are dissimilar to many other countries and data on antibody responses to COVID-19 is also limited. The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics of patients who developed COVID-19, the impact of the screening strategy, and to assess the antibody response to a subset of dialysis patients. METHODS: We retrospectively examined the outcomes of COVID19 infection in all our haemodialysis patients, who were tested regularly for COVID 19, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic. In addition, IgG antibody serology was also performed to assess response to COVID-19 in a subset of patients. RESULTS: 152 (13 %) of 1180 dialysis patients developed COVID-19 during the study period from 1st of March to the 1st of July 2020. Of these 81 % were male, average age of 52â years and 95 % were on in-centre haemodialysis. Family and community contact was most likely source of infection in most patients. Fever (49 %) and cough (48 %) were the most common presenting symptoms, when present. Comorbidities in infected individuals included hypertension (93 %), diabetes (49 %), ischaemic heart disease (30 %). The majority (68 %) developed mild disease, whilst 13 % required critical care. Combinations of drugs including hydroxychloroquine, favipiravir, lopinavir, ritonavir, camostat, tocilizumab and steroids were used based on local guidelines. The median time to viral clearance defined by two negative PCR tests was 15 days [IQR 6-25]. Overall mortality in our cohort was 9.2 %, but ICU mortality was 65 %. COVID-19 IgG antibody serology was performed in a subset (n = 87) but 26 % of PCR positive patients (n = 23) did not develop a significant antibody response. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports a lower mortality in this patient group compared with many published series. Asymptomatic PCR positivity was present in 40 %. Rapid isolation of positive patients may have contributed to the relative lack of spread of COVID-19 within our dialysis units. The lack of antibody response in a few patients is concerning.","Ahmed, Wasim; Al Obaidli, Ali Abdul Kareem; Joseph, Princy; Smith, Edward R; Khan, Ayaz Ahmad; Anwar, Siddiq; Chandrasekar, Thangavelu; Al Madani, Ayman Kamal; Dastoor, Hormazdiar Dara; Zahid, Imran; Costales, Freddie Agbayani; Boobes, Yousef Abdul Rahim; Al Kindi, Fatima; Issa, Salah Eldin Khalil; Hassan, Mohamed H; George, Abraham; Holt, Stephen Geoffrey",BMC Nephrol,368,16

Qualitative studies exploring the experiences of healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic have mainly focused on secondary care. AIM: To understand the experiences of European PCPs working during the first peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN AND SETTING: An exploratory qualitative study, using semi-structured interviews in primary care in England, Belgium, the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, Poland, Greece and Sweden, between April and July 2020. METHOD: Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed using a combination of inductive and deductive thematic analysis techniques. RESULTS: Eighty interviews were conducted with PCPs. PCPs had to make their own decisions on how to rapidly transform services in relation to COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 care. Despite being overwhelmed with guidance, they often lacked access to practical training. Consequently, PCPs turned to their colleagues for moral support and information to try to quickly adjust to new ways of working, including remote care, and deal with uncertainty. CONCLUSION: PCPs rapidly transformed primary care delivery despite a number of challenges. Representation of primary care at policy level and engagement with local primary care champions will facilitate easy and coordinated access to practical information on how to adapt services, ongoing training and access to appropriate mental health support services for PCPs. Preservation of autonomy and responsiveness of primary care are critical to preserve the ability for rapid transformation in any future crisis of care delivery.","Wanat, Marta; Hoste, Melanie; Gobat, Nina; Anastasaki, Marilena; Boehmer, Femke; Chlabicz, Slawomir; Colliers, Annelies; Farrell, Karen; Karkana, Maria-Nefeli; Kinsman, John; Lionis, Christos; Marcinowicz, Ludmila; Reinhardt, Katrin; Skoglund, Ingmarie; Sundvall, Pär-Daniel; Vellinga, Akke; Verheij, Theo; Goossens, Herman; Butler, Christopher; van der Velden, Alike; Anthierens, Sibyl; Tonkin-Crine, Sarah",Br.j.gen.pract,368,20

Although the human-to-human transmission route for this disease has been well established, its transmission mechanism is not fully understood. In this paper, we propose a mathematical model for COVID-19 which incorporates multiple transmission pathways and which employs time-dependent transmission rates reflecting the impact of disease prevalence and outbreak control. Applying this model to a retrospective study based on publicly reported data in China, we argue that the environmental reservoirs play an important role in the transmission and spread of the coronavirus. This argument is supported by our data fitting and numerical simulation results for the city of Wuhan, for the provinces of Hubei and Guangdong, and for the entire country of China.","Yang, Chayu; Wang, Jin",J Biol Dyn,368,1

Methods: A retrospective analysis was conducted using data from the Maryland statewide EMS electronic medical records and daily COVID-19 hospitalizations from March 13, 2020 through July 31, 2020. All unique EMS patients who were identified as COVID-19 PUIs during the study period were included. Descriptive analysis was performed. The Box-Jenkins approach was used to evaluate the relationship between EMS transports and daily new hospitalizations. Separate Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models were constructed to transform the data into a series of independent, identically distributed random variables. Fit was measured using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The Box-Ljung white noise test was utilized to ensure there was no autocorrelation in the residuals. Results: EMS units in Maryland identified a total of 26,855 COVID-19 PUIs during the 141-day study period. The median patient age was 62 years old, and 19,111 (71.3%) were 50 years and older. 6,886 (25.6%) patients had an abnormal initial pulse oximetry (<92%). A strong degree of correlation was observed between EMS PUI transports and new hospitalizations. The correlation was strongest and significant at a 9-day lag from time of EMS PUI transports to new COVID-19 hospitalizations, with a cross correlation coefficient of 0.26 (P < .01). Conclusions: A strong correlation between EMS PUIs and COVID-19 hospitalizations was noted in this state-wide analysis. These findings demonstrate the potential value of incorporating EMS clinical information into the development of a robust syndromic surveillance system for COVID-19. This correlation has important utility in the development of predictive tools and models that seek to provide indicators of an impending surge on the healthcare system at large.","Levy, Matthew J; Klein, Eili; Chizmar, Timothy P; Pinet Peralta, Luis M; Alemayehu, Teferra; Sidik, Mustafa M; Delbridge, Theodore R",Prehosp Emerg Care,368,22

However, professional interpretation usage is infrequent due to high cost and poor interpreter availability. Healthcare-oriented mobile applications are becoming more accepted and may help alleviate this burden. This literature review aims to better understand the utility of mobile technology in healthcare interpretation. Specifically, the objective of this review is to synthesize the feasibility, outcome, and challenges of implementing technological medical interpretation services. PATIENT INVOLVEMENT: No patients were involved for this review. METHODS: In December 2019, MEDLINE (Ovid) was systematically searched according to PRISMA guidelines. All articles discussing the utility of technology in healthcare interpretation encounters were included. RESULTS: Two major themes emerged: 1) comparing video and phone interpretation with in-person interpretation and 2) assessing direct translation software in healthcare settings. Phone and video interpretation help reduce overall patient wait-times. Both patients and clinicians preferred in-person or video interpretation over interpretation by phone. Chief benefits of using direct translation software include immediate access, low costs, and sustainability. Several studies discussed potential translation inaccuracies and the importance of having professional interpreters in medico-legal discussions. CONCLUSION: Mobile applications may be used to facilitate access to medical interpreters with high clinician and patient satisfaction. Direct in-app translations facilitate access but risk inaccuracies with important medico-legal considerations. PRACTICAL VALUE: Mobile applications are available at low costs and can improve access to interpreters though video and phone calls. Mobile software can also provide direct translation and facilitate clinical care. Clinicians should prioritize face-to-face encounters with professional medical interpreters, whenever possible. In a time of social distancing amidst the current COVID-19 pandemic, there is crucial value in elucidating the best telehealth interpretation practices.","Ji, Xinyu; Chow, Ellen; Abdelhamid, Kenzy; Naumova, Darya; Mate, Kedar K V; Bergeron, Amy; Lebouché, Bertrand",Patient educ. couns,368,20

We present a program for IPP using expedient materials for settings of significant limitations in both overwhelmed established ICUs and particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) treating ARDS due to COVID-19 caused by SARS CoV-2. METHODS: The proning program evolved based on the principles of High Reliability Organizations (HROs) and Crew Resource Management (CRM). Patients with severe ARDS [PaO2:FiO2 ratio (PFr) &#8804; 150 on FiO2 &#8805; 0.6 and PEEP &#8805; 5 cm H2O] received IPP. Patients were placed prone 16 h each day. When PFr was &#8805; 200 for > 8 h supine IPP ceased. IPP used available materials without requiring additional work from the bedside team. Changes in PFr, PaCO2, and the SaO2:FiO2 ratio (SaFr) positionally were evaluated using t-statistics and ANOVA with Bonferroni correction (p < 0.017). RESULTS: Between 14APR2020 and 09MAY2020, at the peak of deaths in New York, there were 202 IPPs in 29 patients. Patients were 58.5 ± 1.7 years of age (37, 73), 76% male and had a body mass index (BMI) of 27.8 ± 0.8 (21, 38). Pressor agents were used in 76% and 17% received dialysis. The PFr prior to IPP was 107.5 ± 5.6 and 1 h after IPP was 155.7 ± 11.2 (p < 0.001 compared to pre-prone). PFr after the patients were placed supine was 131.5 ± 9.1 (p = 0.02). Pre-prone PaCO2 was 60.0 ± 2.5 and the 1-h post-prone PaCO2 was 67.2 ± 3.1 (p = 0.02). Supine PaCO2 after IPP was 60.4 ± 3.4 (p = 0.90). The SaFr prior to IPP was 121.3 ± 4.2 and the SaFr 1 h after positioning was 131.5 ± 5.1 (p = 0.03). The post-IPP supine SaFr was 139.7 ± 5.9 (p < 0.001). With ANOVA and Bonferroni correction there were statistically significant changes in PFr (p < 0.001) and SaFr (p < 0.001) and no significant changes in PaCO2 over the four time points measured. Using regression coefficients, the SaFrs predicted by PFrs of 150 and 200 at baseline are 133.2 and 147.3, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: An IPP program for patients with COVID-19 ARDS can be instituted rapidly, safely, and effectively during an overwhelming mass casualty scenario. This approach may be equally applicable in both traditionally austere environments in LMICs and in otherwise capable centers facing situational resource limitations.","Astua, Alfredo J; Michaels, Eli K; Michaels, Andrew J",BMC Pulm Med,368,11

Along with these tasks, we collected data from either an IQ test or a math computation test. Subjects in the lexical decision and item recognition tasks were relatively well-behaved, with only a few giving a significant number of responses with response times (RTs) under 300 ms at chance accuracy, i.e., fast guesses, and a few with unstable RTs across a session. But in the numerosity discrimination tasks, almost half of the subjects gave a significant number of fast guesses and/or unstable RTs across the session. Diffusion model parameters were largely consistent with the earlier studies as were correlations across tasks and correlations with IQ and age. One surprising result was that eliminating fast outliers from subjects with highly variable RTs (those eliminated from the main analyses) produced diffusion model analyses that showed patterns of correlations similar to the subjects with stable performance. Methods for displaying data to examine stability, eliminating subjects, and implementing RT data collection on AMT including checks on timing are also discussed.","Ratcliff, Roger; Hendrickson, Andrew T",Behav. res. meth,368,20

This study aims to establish the prevalence of acute stress disorder and predictors of psychological distress among Jordanian nurses. METHODS: A quantitative, cross-sectional, descriptive and comparative design was used. Data were collected using a Web-based survey. A total of 448 Jordanian nurses (73% females) completed and returned the study questionnaire. RESULTS: The majority of nurses (64%) are experiencing ASD due to the COVID-19 pandemic and thus are at risk for PTSD predisposition. More than one-third of nurses (41%) are also suffering significant psychological distress. Among our sample, age, ASD and coping self-efficacy significantly predicted psychological distress. More specifically, younger nurses are more prone to experience psychological distress than older ones. While higher scores on ASD showed more resultant psychological distress, coping self-efficacy was a protective factor. CONCLUSION: Given that individuals who suffer from ASD are predisposed to PTSD, follow-up with nurses to screen for PTSD and referral to appropriate psychological services is pivotal. Coping self-efficacy is found to ameliorate the effect of psychological distress on nurses' traumatic experience. Such findings warrant intensive efforts from health care institutions to provide psychosocial support services for nurses and ongoing efforts to screen them for traumatic and psychological distress symptoms. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: Nursing leaders and managers are in the forefront of responding to the unique needs of their workforces during the COVID-19 crisis. They need to implement stress-reduction strategies for nurses through providing consecutive rest days, rotating allocations of complex patients, arranging support services and being accessible to staff. They also need to ensure nurses' personal safety through securing and providing personal safety measures and undertake briefings to ensure their staff's physical and mental well-being, as well as providing referrals to appropriate psychological services.","Shahrour, Ghada; Dardas, Latefa Ali",J. nurs. manag,368,16

For instance, after RNA mis-replication, a very premature stop codon (UAG, UAA, UGA) coding for a prematurely truncated (nonsense-mutated) spike protein may occur. In the natural virus replication process via cell infection, the nonsense genomes are corrected by the proofreading enzymes of the virus, strongly penalized by natural selection and condemned to a very short life by the host cell's mRNA watching mechanisms. However, for the very long spike genome of 1273 codons, a truncated non-functional spike protein may potentially still occur with a high frequency, even in presence of a low mutation rate per single nucleotide. With this paper, a hi-fidelity post-processing of SARS-CoV2 spike sequences is provided: in ex-vivo samples from patients, an impressively high rate of 26\% of prematurely-stopped (nonsense-mutated) spike genomes sequences due to insertions/deletions is found, compared with a 9.7\% obtained from in-vitro cell culture. A general warning on the possible high rate of prematurely-stopped spike protein sequences is also raised for""artificial""de novo DNA synthesis processes of SARS-CoV2 spike genomes with no associated natural proofreading/selection, possibly including vaccine preparations.

RECENT FINDINGS: Several, but not all, studies examining disasters including earthquake-affected communities and refugee populations have found increased incidence of PSDs. Studies have been inconsistent regarding psychosis incidence in COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, patients with PSD have been found to cope poorly in recent disasters including flooding and a nuclear accident. Patients with schizophrenia appear to be at particular risk during COVID-19 due to such issues as poor awareness of health precautions and the psychiatric impact of lockdown. However, novel methods including telepsychiatry have allowed care of this population to remain consistent during COVID-19. SUMMARY: There is conflicting evidence as to the association between disasters and onset of PSD, and further study is needed to elucidate this link. Patients with PSDs are more likely to fare worse during disasters. Novel approaches to delivery of care have helped offset the psychiatric risks to PSD patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. These approaches may be applicable to other disaster scenarios or to general outpatient care.","Jing, Genevieve P; Katz, Craig L",Curr Opin Psychiatry,368,20

DESIGN: A longitudinal point prevalence study during August 17- September 4 2020 and December 2nd - 23rd. SETTING: Community based teaching health system. PARTICIPANTS: All HCS were invited to participate. Among HCW who acquired COVID-19, logistic regression models were used to evaluate the adjusted odds of asymptomatic disease using high-risk exposure outside the healthcare system as the explanatory variable. The number of symptoms between exposure groups was evaluated with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The risk of seropositivity among all HCS by work exposure was evaluated during both periods. INTERVENTIONS: Survey and serological testing. RESULT: Seroprevalence increased from 1.9% (95% CI 1.2% - 2.6%) to 13.7% (95% CI 11.9% - 15.5%) during the study. Only during Period 2 did HCW with the highest work exposure (versus low exposure) have an increased risk of seropositivity (RD 7% [95% CI 1% -13%]). Participants who had a high-risk exposure outside of work (compared to those without) had a decreased probability of asymptomatic disease (OR 0.38 [95% CI 0.16 - 0.86]) and demonstrated more symptoms (median of 3 [IQR 5] vs 1 [IQR 2]; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Health care acquired COVID-19 increases the probability of asymptomatic or mild COVID-19 disease compared to community acquired disease.

For investigating the additional effects on the speaker’s vocal output, speech was also recorded while people were reading a text when wearing a mask, and without a mask. In order to discriminate between effects of acoustic filtering by the mask and mask-induced effects of vocal output changes, the latter was monitored by measuring vibrations at the suprasternal notch, using an attached accelerometer. It was found that when wearing a mask, people tend to slightly increase their voice level, while when wearing plastic face shield, they reduce their vocal power. Unlike the Lombard effect, no significant change was found in the spectral content. All face mask and face shields attenuate frequencies above 1–2 kHz. In addition, plastic shields also increase frequency components to around 800 Hz, due to resonances occurring between the face and the shield.

The new type of corona virus COVID-19 disease was firstly discovered in Wuhan-China. However, recently, the virus has been widely spread in most of the world countries and is reported as a pandemic. Further, nowadays, all the world countries are striving to control the coronavirus disease COVID-19. There are many mechanisms to detect the coronavirus disease COVID-19 including clinical analysis of chest CT scan images and blood test results. The confirmed COVID-19 patient manifests as fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Particularly, several techniques can be used to detect the initial results of the virus such as medical detection Kits. However, such devices are incurring huge cost and it takes time to install them and use.

Globally, the cumulative number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases is increasing daily. Thus the potential for ocular transmission and manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 requires more investigation. METHODS: A systematic search of electronic databases for ocular transmission and manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 was performed. Pooled cross-sectional studies were used for conducting a meta-analysis to estimate the prevalence of ocular transmission of SARS-CoV-2 to the respiratory system and ocular manifestations (associated symptoms) of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The highest prevalence of SARS-CoV-2-positive tears using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was found to be 7.5%. However, the highest prevalence of ocular conjunctivitis associated with SARS-CoV-2 was 32%. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 can evidently infect the eye, as revealed in the conjunctival secretions of COVID-19 patients. CONCLUSION: The available data reflect the influence of the ocular structure on SARS-CoV-2. The analysis showed that ocular manifestation is an indication for SARS-CoV-2, particularly conjunctivitis. Moreover, there is no evidence that the ocular structure can be an additional path of transmission for SARS-CoV-2, however, it warrants further investigation.","Almazroa, Ahmed; Alamri, Suhailah; Alabdulkader, Balsam; Alkozi, Hanan; Khan, Altaf; Alghamdi, Walead",International health (Online),368,29

The stem-loop 2 motif (s2m) is one such element with an unusually high degree of sequence conservation, being found in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) in the genomes of many astroviruses, some picornaviruses and noroviruses, and a variety of coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2. The evolutionary conservation and its occurrence in all viral subgenomic transcripts imply a key role for s2m in the viral infection cycle. Our findings indicate that the element, while stably folded, can nonetheless be invaded and remodeled spontaneously by antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) that initiate pairing in exposed loops and trigger efficient sequence-specific RNA cleavage in reporter assays. ASOs also act to inhibit replication in an astrovirus replicon model system in a sequence-specific, dose-dependent manner and inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication in cell culture. Our results thus permit us to suggest that the s2m element is readily targeted by ASOs, which show promise as antiviral agents. IMPORTANCE The highly conserved stem-loop 2 motif (s2m) is found in the genomes of many RNA viruses, including SARS-CoV-2.

CRISPR/Cas systems have the capabilities to be optimized for this purpose. There is a broad diversity among Cas12a nucleases with immense detection capability, but only a few have been purified and studied biochemically. Here we present the investigation of 22 Cas12a orthologs, with a focus on their cis- and trans-cleavage activity, and thermal stability in combination with non-canonical crRNAs. We noticed that some non-canonical crRNA:Cas12a effector complexes outperformed its corresponding wild-type crRNA:Cas12a complex in trans-cleavage assays. In particular, TsCas12a, ErCas12a, and ArCas12a showed an increase in thermal stability in binary complex compared to its wild-type structure and apo form. Moreover, Cas12a was observed to have the ability to recruit segments of truncated crRNAs providing insights into crRNA:Cas12a catalytic complex with potential for further applications. We also discovered that ErCas12a, BsCas12a, BoCas12a, and TsCas12a possess robust trans-cleavage activity with a shorter PAM sequence requirement. Finally, we applied these effector complexes to discriminately detect SARS-CoV-2 and its B.1.1.7 lineage in clinical nasopharyngeal swabs, saliva samples, and tracheal aspirates. Our findings further expand the toolbox for next-generation CRISPR-based diagnostics.","Nguyen, Long T.; Macaluso, Nicolas C.; Jain, Piyush K.",,368,24

METHODS: In May 2020, we interrogated the MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL databases. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratios of CT for COVID-19 identification were computed. Cumulative positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value, stratified by disease prevalence, were calculated. RESULTS: Ten articles were included (1332 patients). Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and summary diagnostic odds ratio of CT were 82% [95% confidence interval (CI), 79%-84%], 68% (95% CI, 65%-71%), and 18 (95% CI, 9.8-32.8). The PPV and negative predictive value were 54% (95% CI, 30%-77%) and 94% (95% CI, 88%-99%) at a COVID-19 prevalence lower than 40%, and 80% (95% CI, 62%-91%) and 77% (95% CI, 68%-85%) at a prevalence higher than 40%. CONCLUSION: CT yields higher specificity and PPV, albeit lower sensitivity, than previously reported for the identification of COVID-19.","Bellini, Davide; Panvini, Nicola; Carbone, Iacopo; Rengo, Marco; Wang, Carolyn L; Mileto, Achille",J Comput Assist Tomogr,368,1

Various factors ranging from emissions from traffic and power plants, household emissions, natural causes are known to be primary causal agents or influencers behind rising air pollution levels. However, the lack of large scale data involving the major factors has hindered the research on the causes and relations governing the variability of the different air pollutants. Through this work, we introduce a large scale city-wise dataset for exploring the relationships among these agents over a long period of time. We analyze and explore the dataset to bring out inferences which we can derive by modeling the data.

Nearly 800 000 people around the world lose their life to suicide every year, and many more attempt suicide. METHODS: A decomposition analysis was performed using global suicide mortality and population data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019. RESULTS: Despite a significant decrease in age-specific suicide rate between 1990 and 2019 (-4.01; from 13.8% to 9.8% per 100 000), the overall numbers of suicide deaths increased by 19 897 (from 738 799 to 758 696) in the same time period. The reductions in age-specific suicide rates (-6.09; 152%) contributed to the overall reductions in suicide rates; however, this was offset by overtime changes in population age structure (2.08; -52%). The increase in suicide numbers was partly attributable to population growth (300 942; 1512.5%) and population age structure (189 512; 952.4%), which was attenuated by the significant reduction in overall suicide rates (-470 556; 2364.9%). The combined effect of these factors varied across the World Bank income level regions. For example, in the upper-middle-income level region, the effect of the reduction in age-specific suicide rates (-289 731; -1456.1%) exceeded the effect of population age structure (124 577; 626.1%) and population growth (83 855; 421.4%), resulting in its substantial decline in total suicide deaths (-81 298; -408.6%). However, in lower-middle income region, there was a notable increase in suicide death (72 550; 364.6%), which was related to the net gain of the reduction in age-specific suicide rates (-115 577; -580.9%) and negated by the increase in the number of suicide deaths due to population growth (152 093; 764.4%) and population age structure (36 034; 181.1%). CONCLUSION: More support and resources should be deployed for suicide prevention to the low-income and middle-income regions in order to achieve the reduction goal. Moreover, suicide prevention among older adults is increasingly critical given the world's rapidly ageing populations in all income level regions.","Yip, Paul Siu Fai; Zheng, Yan; Wong, Clifford",Inj. prev,368,6

Using fluid-phase luciferase immune precipitation (LIPS) assays, we characterized IgG, IgM, and IgA antibodies to the spike receptor binding domain (RBD), S1+S2, nucleocapsid, and ORF6 to ORF10 of SARS-CoV-2, to the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 betacoronaviruses spike S2, and the H1N1Ca2009 flu virus hemagglutinin. Sequential samples at 1 and 3 months after hospital discharge were also tested for SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies in 95 patients.RESULTSAntibodies developed rapidly against multiple SARS-CoV-2 antigens in 95% of patients by 4 weeks after symptom onset and IgG to the RBD increased until the third month of follow-up. We observed a major synchronous expansion of antibodies to the HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 spike S2. A likely coinfection with influenza was neither linked to a more severe presentation of the disease nor to a worse outcome. Of the measured antibody responses, positivity for IgG against the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD was predictive of survival.CONCLUSIONThe measurement of antibodies to selected epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 antigens can offer a more accurate assessment of the humoral response in patients and its impact on survival. The presence of partially cross-reactive antibodies with other betacoronaviruses is likely to impact on serological assay specificity and interpretation.TRIAL REGISTRATIONCOVID-19 Patients Characterization, Biobank, Treatment Response and Outcome Predictor (COVID-BioB).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: By using administrative data from all outpatient hospital encounters in California (2005-2011) and Florida (2005-2014), all patients in the outpatient setting with symptomatic uterine leiomyomata were identified. Patients were categorized as undergoing hysterectomy, myomectomy, uterine artery embolization (UAE), or no intervention. Hospital stay durations and costs were recorded for each encounter. RESULTS: A total of 227,489 patients with uterine leiomyomata were included, among whom 39.9% (n = 90,800) underwent an intervention, including hysterectomy (73%), myomectomy (19%), or UAE (8%). The proportion of patients undergoing hysterectomy increased over time (2005, hysterectomy, 53.2%; myomectomy, 26.9%; UAE, 18.0%; vs 2013, hysterectomy, 80.1%; myomectomy, 14.4%; UAE, 4.0%). Hysterectomy was eventually performed in 3.5% of patients who underwent UAE and 4.1% who underwent myomectomy. Mean length of stay following hysterectomy was significantly longer (0.5 d) vs myomectomy (0.2 d) and UAE (0.3 d; P < .001 for both). The mean encounter cost for UAE ($3,772) was significantly less than those for hysterectomy ($5,409; P < .001) and myomectomy ($6,318; P < .001). Of the 7,189 patients who underwent UAE during the study period, 3.5% underwent subsequent hysterectomy. CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of women treated with hysterectomy in the outpatient setting has increased since 2005. As a lower-cost alternative with a low rate of conversion to hysterectomy, UAE may be an underutilized treatment option for patients with uterine leiomyomata.","Wang, Courtney; Kuban, Joshua D; Lee, Stephen R; Yevich, Steven; Metwalli, Zeyad; McCarthy, Colin J; Sheth, Sunil A; Sheth, Rahul A",J. vasc. interv. radiol,368,1

METHODS: Patients with complex cerebral arteriovenous malformations seen in our neurosurgery department from January 2016 to December 2017 were prospectively enrolled. The hybrid surgery protocol included ""angiographic diagnosis, surgical resection, and intraoperative angiographic evaluation"" and ""angiographic diagnosis and embolization, surgical resection, and intraoperative angiographic evaluation"". The patients were randomly stratified into intensive care group and routine care group. After surgery, intensive or routine care was provided, and the prognosis of patients was evaluated, with a subsequent comparative analysis. RESULTS: A total of 109 cases were divided into the routine nursing group (n = 54 cases) and intensive nursing group (n = 55 cases). There were no significant differences between the two groups in baseline data before surgery. Postoperative lung infection in the intensive nursing group was significantly less frequent than those in the routine nursing group (5.5% vs. 18.5%, P=0.039) with pulmonary infection and lower extremity venous thrombosis (5.5% vs. 24.1%, P=0.006). The average hospital stay in the intensive nursing group was 14.4 ± 5.78 days, which was significantly lower than that in the routine nursing group (19.3 ± 6.38 days, P=0.013). At 3 months' follow-up after surgery, the Generic Quality of Life Inventory-74 (GQOLI-74) dimension score and GQOLI-74 total score in the enhanced group were significantly better than those in the routine nursing group (P=0.017 and 0.023, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Intensive postoperative nursing can improve the safety of patients after hybrid surgery, reduce the postoperative complications and the average length of hospital stay, and improve the quality of life of patients.","Zhao, Dong-Hong; Xue, Rui; Sun, Xiao-Rong",Chin Neurosurg J,368,16

Despite the widespread availability of attenuated vaccines, safer, more stable, and more effective CPV2 vaccine candidates are still under exploration. Vaccinia virus (VV) has already been proved to be a safe, stable, and effective vaccine vector. In this study, we generated a VV-based CPV2 vaccine candidate (VV-CPV-VP2) and then evaluated its immunogenicity in mice and dogs. The exogenous vp2 gene of CPV2, which replaced the major virulence gene hemagglutinin (ha) of VV, expressed efficiently and stably in vitro. Subsequently, intramuscular immunization of mice induced robust and lasting systemic immune responses, including neutralizing antibody against both CPV2a and CPV2b, and CPV2-VP2-specific interferon gamma (IFN-Î³) secreting T cell. In addition, administration with a high-dose of VV-CPV-VP2 did not cause significant side effects for mice, thus indicating marked safety of this vaccine candidate. Most importantly, a single-dose vaccination of VV-CPV2-VP2 elicited substantial antibody responses and provided comparable protection for dogs with attenuated CPV2 vaccine. Collectively, this study demonstrated that VV-CPV2-VP2 could be used as a promising vaccine candidate preventing CPV2 from infection for dogs.","Zhao, Wanbo; Wang, Xiaomei; Li, Yi; Li, Yaoming",Viral Immunol,368,14

DESIGN: Nationwide nested case-control study. SETTINGS: South Korea. PARTICIPANTS: Psychiatric inpatients. INTERVENTIONS: Continuity of psychiatric outpatient care was measured from the time of hospital discharge until readmission or death occurred, using the continuity of care index. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Readmission, all-cause mortality, and suicides within 1-year post-discharge. RESULTS: Of 18,702 psychiatric inpatients in the study, 8,022 (42.9%) were readmitted, 355 (1.9%) died, and 108 (0.6%) died by suicide within 1 year after discharge. Compared to the psychiatric inpatients with a high continuity-of-care score, a significant increase in the readmission risk within 1 year after discharge was found in those with medium and low continuity of care scores. An increased risk of all-cause mortality within 1 year after hospital discharge was shown in the patients in the low continuity group, relative to those in the high-continuity group. The risk of suicide within 1 year after hospital discharge was higher in those with medium and low continuity of care than those with high continuity of care. CONCLUSION: This study's results provide empirical evidence of the importance of continuity of care when designing policies to improve the quality of mental health care, such as increasing patient awareness of the importance of continuity and implementation of policies to promote continuity.","Choi, Young; Nam, Chung Mo; Lee, Sang Gyu; Park, Sohee; Ryu, Hwang-Gun; Park, Eun-Cheol",Int. j. qual. health care,368,24

The amount of aerosol generation from the respiratory tract with these various oxygen modalities is unknown.Objectives: To measure the size and number concentration of particles and droplets generated from the respiratory tract of humans exposed to various oxygen delivery modalities.Methods: Ten healthy participants with no active pulmonary disease were enrolled. Oxygen modalities tested included nonhumidified nasal cannula, face mask, heated and humidified high-flow nasal cannula, and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. Aerosol generation was measured with each oxygen mode while participants performed maneuvers of normal breathing, talking, deep breathing, and coughing. Testing was conducted in a negative-pressure room. Particles with a diameter between 0.37 and 20 µm were measured using an aerodynamic particle spectrometer.Measurements and Main Results: Median particle concentration ranged from 0.041 to 0.168 particles/cm3. Median diameter ranged from 1.01 to 1.53 µm. Cough significantly increased the number of particles measured. Measured aerosol concentration did not significantly increase with the use of either humidified high-flow nasal cannula or noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation. This was the case during normal breathing, talking, deep breathing, and coughing.Conclusions: Oxygen delivery modalities of humidified high-flow nasal cannula and noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation do not increase aerosol generation from the respiratory tract in healthy human participants with no active pulmonary disease measured in a negative-pressure room.","Gaeckle, Nathaniel T; Lee, Jihyeon; Park, Yensil; Kreykes, Gean; Evans, Michael D; Hogan, Christopher J",Am J Respir Crit Care Med,368,24

This study evaluated access to health care services among selected essential workers. METHODS: We used the most recent data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, 2017-2018, to estimate the prevalence of 4 measures of health care access (having health insurance, being able to afford to see a doctor when needed, having a personal health care provider, and having a routine checkup in the past year) by broad and detailed occupation group among 189 208 adults aged 18-64. RESULTS: Of all occupations studied, workers in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations were most likely to have no health insurance (46.4%). Personal care aides were most likely to have been unable to see a doctor when needed because of cost (29.3%). Construction laborers were most likely to lack a personal health care provider (51.1%) and to have not had a routine physical checkup in the past year (50.6%). Compared with workers in general, workers in 3 broad occupation groups-food preparation and serving; building and grounds cleaning and maintenance; and construction trades-had significantly lower levels of health care access for all 4 measures. CONCLUSION: Lack of health insurance and underinsurance were common among subsets of essential workers. Limited access to health care might decrease essential workers' access to medical testing and needed care and hinder their ability to address underlying conditions, thereby increasing their risk of severe outcomes from some infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. Improving access to health care for all workers, including essential workers, is critical to ensure workers' health and workforce stability.","Boal, Winifred L; Li, Jia; Silver, Sharon R",Public Health Rep,368,16

METHODS: PubMed, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WANFANG DATA, and VIP Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals were searched for articles published from January 1, 2019, to April 19, 2020. The prevalence estimates of adverse mental health symptoms in medical staff were pooled using the random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of 35 articles and data of 25,343 medical staff were used in the final analysis. The pooled prevalence estimates in medical staff during the COVID-19 pandemic were as follows (ordered from high to low): fear-related symptoms, 67% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 61%-73%); high levels of perceived stress, 56% (95% CI = 32%-79%), anxiety symptoms, 41% (95% CI = 35%-47%); insomnia, 41% (95% CI = 33%-50%); posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, 38% (95% CI = 34%-43%); depressive symptoms, 27% (95% CI = 20%-34%); and somatic symptoms, 16% (95% CI = 3%-36%). The subgroup analysis revealed that the prevalence estimates of fear-related symptoms were consistently high. CONCLUSIONS: Medical staff during the COVID-19 epidemic have a high prevalence of adverse mental health symptoms.

Becoming acquainted traditionally relies heavily on face-to-face interaction to advance and cement feelings of trust that eventually lead to successfully concluded transactions. Using linguistic ethnography, I interviewed 36 professionals about networking during COVID. For all three aspects of networking (creating, cultivating, and utilizing relationships for attaining professional goals), participants indicated significant changes as embodied co-present interactions all but ceased and were replaced by computer-mediated communication, including video platforms such as Zoom. Many, but not all, participants indicated that they had made either no new, or a greatly decreased number of new professional acquaintances, compared to pre-COVID times. The cues that would be present in face-to-face interaction were largely viewed as essential for establishing trust in deepening relationships and achieving professional goals such as concluding transactions. There were some compensatory affordances such as more ‘objective’ evaluations and equalization for those in more peripheral geographic locations. The material outcomes were that, for most, new relationships were significantly handicapped, resulting in networks in a state of stasis, a situation that privileged extant connections and those with strong professional networks.","Militello, Jacqueline",Languages,368,1

High dose intravenous immunoglobulin is the most effective approach to reduce cardiovascular complications. It remains unclear why patients with KS develop coronary artery aneurysms. A subset of patients is resistant to immunoglobulin therapy. Given the heterogeneity of clinical features, variability of history, and therapeutic response, KS may be a cluster of phenotypes triggered by multiple infectious agents and influenced by various environmental, genetic, and immunologic responses. The cause of KS is unknown, and a diagnostic test remains lacking. A better understanding of mechanisms leading to acute KS would contribute to a more precision medicine approach for this complex disease.

To mitigate the spread of the virus, many states in the U.S. issued lockdown orders to urge their residents to stay at their homes, avoid get-togethers, and minimize physical interactions. While many offline workers are experiencing significant challenges performing their duties, digital technologies have provided ample tools for individuals to continue working and to maintain their productivity. Although using digital platforms to build resilience in remote work is effective, other aspects of remote work (beyond the continuation of work) should also be considered in gauging true resilience. In this study, we focus on content creators, and investigate how restrictions in individual's physical environment impact their online content creation behavior. Exploiting a natural experimental setting wherein four states issued state-wide lockdown orders on the same day whereas five states never issued a lockdown order, and using a unique dataset collected from a short video-sharing social media platform, we study the impact of lockdown orders on content creators' behaviors in terms of content volume, content novelty, and content optimism. We combined econometric methods (difference-in-differences estimations of a matched sample) with machine learning-based natural language processing to show that on average, compared to the users residing in non-lockdown states, the users residing in lockdown states create more content after the lockdown order enforcement. However, we find a decrease in the novelty level and optimism of the content generated by the latter group. Our findings have important contributions to the digital resilience literature and shed light on managers' decision-making process related to the adjustment of employees' work mode in the long run.","Wang, Xunyi; Mousavi, Reza; Hong, Yili",,368,16

Weick and Sutcliffe (Managing the unexpected: resilient performance in an age of uncertainty. Wiley, San Francisco, 2007 [1]) argue that ‘unexpected events often audit our resilience. Everything that was left unprepared becomes a complex problem’. Leadership plays a pivotal role in managing such crisis (whether they emerge as a black swan event (Taleb in The black swan: the impact of the highly improbable. Penguin Books Ltd, London, 2007 [2]), the ‘elephant in the room’ or as a ‘creeping crisis’ (Boin et al. in Risk Hazards Crisis Public Policy 11(2), 2020c [3]). The Covid-19 pandemic for example has resulted in considerable impact on global health security, human security and the global economy. As described in (OECD in A systemic resilience approach to dealing with Covid-19 and future shocks New Approaches to Economic Challenges, 2020 [4]), ‘…the pandemic has reminded us bluntly of the fragility of some of our most basic human-made systems. Shortages of masks, tests, ventilators and other essential items have left frontline workers and the general population dangerously exposed to the disease itself. At a wider level, we have witnessed the cascading collapse of entire production, financial, and transportation systems, due to a vicious combination of supply and demand shocks’. This highlights the volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity (VUCA) conditions that shape the crisis landscape and its effect on inherent vulnerabilities that exist within our systems. By drawing upon recent disaster events and more recently the COVID-19 pandemic, this chapter examines sensemaking within the context of crisis leadership and presents a crisis leadership framework focused on absorptive, adaptive and generative capacities (Castillo and Trinh in J Organ Change Manage 32(3), 2019 [5]) to support problem framing, solution navigation and innovation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Masys, A.

We investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on acute stroke care quality and clinical outcomes to detect healthcare system's bottlenecks from a territorial point of view. METHODS: Crossed-data analysis between a prospective nation-based mandatory registry of acute stroke, Emergency Medical System (EMS) records, and daily incidence of COVID-19 in Catalonia (Spain). We included all stroke code activations during the pandemic (March 15-May 2, 2020) and an immediate prepandemic period (January 26-March 14, 2020). Primary outcomes were stroke code activations and reperfusion therapies in both periods. Secondary outcomes included clinical characteristics, workflow metrics, differences across types of stroke centers, correlation analysis between weekly EMS alerts, COVID-19 cases, and workflow metrics, and impact on mortality and clinical outcome at 90 days. RESULTS: Stroke code activations decreased by 22% and reperfusion therapies dropped by 29% during the pandemic period, with no differences in age, stroke severity, or large vessel occlusion. Calls to EMS were handled 42 min later, and time from onset to hospital arrival increased by 53 min, with significant correlations between weekly COVID-19 cases and more EMS calls (rho = 0.81), less stroke code activations (rho = -0.37), and longer prehospital delays (rho = 0.25). Telestroke centers were afflicted with higher reductions in stroke code activations, reperfusion treatments, referrals to endovascular centers, and increased delays to thrombolytics. The independent odds of death increased (OR 1.6 [1.05-2.4], p 0.03) and good functional outcome decreased (mRS &#8804;2 at 90 days: OR 0.6 [0.4-0.9], p 0.015) during the pandemic period. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Catalonia's stroke system's weakest points were the delay to EMS alert and a decline of stroke code activations, reperfusion treatments, and interhospital transfers, mostly at local centers. Patients suffering an acute stroke during the pandemic period had higher odds of poor functional outcome and death. The complete stroke care system's analysis is crucial to allocate resources appropriately.","Ramos-Pachón, Anna; García-Tornel, Álvaro; Millán, Mònica; Ribó, Marc; Amaro, Sergi; Cardona, Pere; Martí-Fàbregas, Joan; Roquer, Jaume; Silva, Yolanda; Ustrell, Xavier; Purroy, Francisco; Gómez-Choco, Manuel; Zaragoza-Brunet, José; Cánovas, David; Krupinski, Jurek; Sala, Natalia Mas; Palomeras, Ernest; Cocho, Dolores; Redondo, Laura; Repullo, Carmen; Sanjurjo, Eduardo; Carrión, Dolors; López, Mercè; Almendros, M Cruz; Barceló, Miquel; Monedero, Jordi; Catena, Esther; Rybyeba, Maria; Diaz, Gloria; Jiménez-Fàbrega, Xavier; Solà, Silvia; Hidalgo, Verónica; Pueyo, Maria Jesus; Pérez de la Ossa, Natàlia; Urra, Xabier",Cerebrovasc Dis,368,16

Travel restrictions and limits on large public gatherings have necessitated the cancelling of numerous regional and national conferences as well as local grand rounds at many academic centers. Podcasting provides a potential solution for providing CME in a safe, socially distant way as an alternative to these more traditional CME sources for health care professionals. Using a popular CME podcast for pediatric hospitalists as an example, this article describes the many advantages that podcasting poses over more traditional CME methods, outlines some of the methodological and technological considerations that go into creating a high-quality podcast, and describes how podcasting can be leveraged during a global pandemic. Finally, we identify areas for further research regarding podcasting, including effective ways to virtually replace the more social and community building aspects of traditional conferences and grand rounds.","Tarchichi, Tony R; Szymusiak, John",J. contin. educ. health prof,368,3

With the increasing accessibility of technology, a ""flipped classroom"" allows students to learn foundational material independently. Class time is instead devoted to in-depth skill building with instructors, promoting an active learning environment. This method of content delivery is also relevant given the current COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVES: To comprehensively evaluate the benefit of adopting a flipped classroom approach in teaching physical exam skills (PES) to first-year osteopathic medical students. METHODS: A cohort study was conducted comparing first-year osteopathic students in the class of 2022 (n=201), who had taken the PES course traditionally, with the class of 2023 (n=203), who experienced the flipped classroom approach. Objective metrics such as cumulative grades, objective structural clinical examination performance (OSCE), and practical exam performance were compared using nonparametric Mann-Whitney U rank sum tests. Subjective measures such as student course evaluations were used to analyze course perceptions using independent sample t-tests assuming unequal variances. A faculty survey was administered to faculty who taught both cohorts to assess instructor attitudes toward the flipped classroom approach. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Spring 2020 quarter data was not included, given the transition of all classes to an online learning environment. RESULTS: The flipped classroom approach significantly improved objective student performance for the Fall (p=0.009) and Winter (p<0.001) student cumulative grades and the History-Taking OSCE (p=0.010). Performance on Fall and Winter practical exam scores had no significant association with the flipped classroom. General student perceptions of the course remained unchanged between both cohorts. Faculty survey results from 10 faculty members showed that six (60%) faculty members preferred the traditional classroom, while four (40%) preferred the flipped classroom. CONCLUSIONS: The flipped classroom approach showed some statistically significant improvement in student PES. Further studies are needed to evaluate the benefits of a flipped classroom approach using skills-based assessments styles to measure student performance, with a focus on standardization of in-classroom groupwork.","Bhai, Sahar Amin; Poustinchian, Brian",J Osteopath Med,368,20

In this report, we describe an adjuvanted subunit candidate vaccine that affords elevated, sustained and cross-variant SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibodies (NAbs) in multiple animal models. Alhydroxiquim-II is a TLR7/8 small-molecule agonist chemisorbed on aluminium hydroxide. Vaccination with Alhydroxiquim-II combined with a stabilized, trimeric form of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (termed CoVac-II) resulted in high-titre NAbs in mice, with no decay in responses over an 8-month period. NAbs from sera of CoVac-II-immunized mice, horses and rabbits were broadly neutralising against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Boosting long-term CoVac-II-immunized mice with adjuvanted spike protein from the Beta variant markedly increased levels of NAb titres against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants; notably high titres against the Delta variant were observed. These data strongly support the clinical assessment of Alhydroxiquim-II-adjuvanted spike proteins to protect against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern.","Counoupas, Claudio; Pino, Paco; Stella, Alberto; Ashley, Caroline; Lukeman, Hannah; Bhattacharyya, Nayan; Tada, Takuya; Anchisi, Stephanie; Metayer, Charles; Martinis, Jacopo; Aggarwal, Anupriya; Dcosta, Belinda; Kint, Joeri; Wurm, Maria; Landau, Nathaniel; Steain, Megan; Turville, Stuart; Wurm, Florian; David, Sunil; Triccas, James A",,368,1

The primary reuse potential of this forecasting data is to enable decision-makers to develop action plans against the pandemic, and to help researchers working in infection prevention and control to: 1) explore limited data usage in predicting infections. 2) develop a reinforcement learning model on top of this data-lake, which can perform an online game between the trained models to generate a new capable model for predicting future true data. The prediction data was generated by training 4200 recurrent neural networks (54 to 84 days validation periods) on raw data from Johns Hopkins University's online repository, to pave the way for generating reliable extended long-term predictions.","Hawas, Mohamed",Data Brief,368,3

To overcome this resistance, 4-anilinoquinazoline-based irreversible inhibitors afatinib, dacomitinib has been developed. However, the clinical application of these irreversible inhibitors is limited due to its narrow selectivity against L858R/T790M mutant EGFR. In an attempt to develop potent and selective EGFR T790M inhibitors, we have designed and synthesized two series of novel acrylamide linked quinazolines. Among them, compounds 2i (IC50 0.171 µM) and 11h (IC50 0.159 µM) were identified as potent compounds, which displayed selective and potent anti-proliferative activity on gefitinib-resistant cell line NCI-H1975 as compared to the gefitinib and WZ4002 in cellular assay. Furthermore, a molecular dynamic simulation of 11h was carried out to assess the stability to form a complex with the L858R/T790M EGFR Kinase domain, which demonstrated that complex was stable for the 100 ns and form strong crucial covalent binding contacts with the thiol group of Cys797 residue. Finally, satisfactory in silico pharmacokinetics properties of 2i, 11h and 11i compounds were predicted. The synthesized compounds were also evaluated for in vitro cytotoxic activity/hepatotoxicity against HepG2 cell line through MTT assay. The results revealed that compounds exhibited lower cytotoxicity to HepG2 cells.","Pawara, Rahul; Ahmad, Iqrar; Nayak, Deepika; Wagh, Shivani; Wadkar, Avinash; Ansari, Azim; Belamkar, Sateesh; Surana, Sanjay; Nath Kundu, Chanakya; Patil, Chandragauda; Patel, Harun",Bioorg Chem,368,16

It was used extensively during the 1990s for this purpose as well as in other epidemiological contexts. Surveillance data on COVID-19 diagnoses can be analysed by the method of back-projection using information about the probability distribution of the time between infection and diagnosis, which is primarily determined by the incubation period. This paper demonstrates the value of such analyses using daily diagnoses from Australia. It is shown how back-projection can be used to assess the pattern of COVID-19 infection incidence over time and to assess the impact of control measures by investigating their temporal association with changes in incidence patterns. For Australia, these analyses reveal that peak infection incidence coincided with the introduction of border closures and social distancing restrictions, while the introduction of subsequent social distancing measures coincided with a continuing decline in incidence to very low levels. These associations were not directly discernible from the daily diagnosis counts, which continued to increase after the first stage of control measures. It is estimated that a one week delay in peak incidence would have led to a fivefold increase in total infections. Furthermore, at the height of the outbreak, half to three-quarters of all infections remained undiagnosed. Automated data analytics of routinely collected surveillance data are a valuable monitoring tool for the COVID-19 pandemic and may be useful for calibrating transmission dynamics models.","Marschner, I C",Epidemiol Infect,368,1

Method: From April to June 2020, minors with recent skin manifestations and symptoms of COVID-19, themselves or any of first-degree relatives, were enrolled. Epidemiological and clinical information, and biological results including 3 types of SARS-CoV-2 tests [nasal PCR (systemic symptoms within the past 48 hours), serology (IgG, Abbott ARCHITECT), and IFN-γ-ELISPOT-assay] were collected. Results: Thirty patients (20 boys, average 9.5 years) and 37 symptomatic first-degree relatives were enrolled. Seventeen patients presented with chilblains (Figure 1) occurring before (n = 2, average: 19 days), simultaneously (n = 2, 12%) or after systemic manifestations (60%, average: 22 days). Spontaneous resolution was complete in 27 days (10-50) in 11/17 patients. Elevated CRP and/or increased inflammatory cytokines were noted in 11 children (37%) including 8/17 with chilblains (47%): mostly TNF-α, IL-1, type 1 IFN and IL-6. Biological inflammation was not correlated with time lapses from cutaneous or systemic symptoms to the blood test, or with severity of chilblains. The 3/3 PCR, the 10/10 IFN-γ-ELISPOT-assay and the 15/16 serology were negative. Dicussion: A cytokine storm was described in adults with COVID-19 and in the paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-COV-2 infection: elevated CRP and IL-6 levels. The peak of incidence of COVID-19 and the reported chilblains occurred simultaneously. Only 1/16 serology in children with chilblains was positive. Its sensitivity varies from 100 to 85% in severe or mild symptomatic patients respectively. We confirmed the COVID-19 only once, using 3 different methods. This result might reflect the estimated prevalence of seropositivity for SARS-CoV-2 in the general French population. While epidemiological data, clinical manifestations and elevated cytokines level suggest an association with SARS-CoV-2, no evident link could have been made here.","Fertitta, L.; Welfringer-Morin, A.; Polivka, L.; Chhun, S.; Ouedrani, A.; Chatenoud, L.; Hadj-Rabia, S.; Sermet-Gaudelus, I.; Bodemer, C.",Pediatric Dermatology,368,19

Method: 94 consecutive Urgent Suspicion of Cancer (USOC) referrals undergoing gastroscopy were studied over a 6-month period. General, and specific upper GI symptoms, as well as endoscopic findings, were recorded. Results: 68% of patients were female. 98% of referrals mentioned weight loss, 94.5% of these patients had concurrent symptoms. 77.5% of patients had a positive finding. 5% (n=5) had a diagnosis of malignancy. Of the 5 diagnosed with malignancy, none had presented with symptoms of weight loss alone. Conclusions: Our practice is in accordance with NICE guidelines. Despite perception, OGD for weight loss alone does not occur commonly. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, it is even more important to vet patients appropriately to prevent unnecessary aerosol generating procedures. We cannot extrapolate from this pilot study whether weight loss alone, is a good indicator for detecting upper GI malignancies, though all cases of malignancy had other specific alarm symptoms.","Pickard, C.; Komolafe, S.",British Journal of Surgery,368,16

SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen of COVID-19, enters into cells through binding to the Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) homolog-2 (ACE2). ACE2 is a regulator of two contrary pathways in renin angiotensin system (RAS): ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis and ACE2-Ang 1-7-Mas axis. Viral entry process eventuates in downregulation of ACE2 and subsequent activation of ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis. ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis increases lipid storage, reduces white-to-beige fat conversion and plays role in obesity. Conversely, adipose tissue is an important source of angiotensin, and obesity results in increased systemic RAS. ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis, which has proinflammatory, profibrotic, prothrombotic, and vasoconstrictive effects, is potential mechanism of more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. The link between obesity and severe COVID-19 may be attributed to ACE2 consumption and subsequent ACE-Ang-II-AT1R axis activation. Therefore, patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection may benefit from therapeutic strategies that activate ACE2-Ang 1-7-Mas axis, such as Ang II receptor blockers (ARBs), ACE inhibitors (ACEIs), Mas receptor agonists and ACE2.","Aksoy, Hasan; Karadag, Ayse Serap; Wollina, Uwe",Dermatol Ther,368,30

The antibody and cellular responses were tightly interconnected, their magnitude inversely correlated with infection probability. Similar maximal level of protection was reached by individuals positive for both types of responses and by individuals with antibodies alone.

The interplay of biological, social, structural and random factors makes disease forecasting extraordinarily complex. In this work, we reframe a stochastic branching process analysis in terms of probability generating functions and compare it to continuous time epidemic simulations on networks. In doing so, we predict the diversity of emerging epidemic courses on both homogeneous and heterogeneous networks. We show how the challenge of inferring the early course of an epidemic falls on the randomness of disease spread more so than on the heterogeneity of contact patterns. We provide an analysis which helps quantify, in real time, the probability that an epidemic goes supercritical or conversely, dies stochastically. These probabilities are often assumed to be one and zero, respectively, if the basic reproduction number, or R0, is greater than 1, ignoring the heterogeneity and randomness inherent to disease spread. This framework can give more insight into early epidemic spread by weighting standard deterministic models with likelihood to inform pandemic preparedness with probabilistic forecasts.","Allen, Andrea J.; Boudreau, Mariah C.; Roberts, Nicholas J.; Allard, Antoine; H'ebert-Dufresne, Laurent",,368,1

Years of life lost is therefore widely used as a more relevant metric, however, such calculations in the context of COVID-19 are all biased upwards: patients dying from COVID-19 are typically multimorbid, having far worse life expectation than the general population. These questions are quantitatively investigated using a unique Hungarian dataset that contains individual patient level data on comorbidities for all COVID-19 deaths in the country. To account for the comorbidities of the patients, a parametric survival model using 11 important long-term conditions was used to estimate a more realistic years of life lost. As of 12 May, 2021, Hungary reported a total of 27,837 deaths from COVID-19 in patients above 50 years of age. The usual calculation indicates 10.5 years of life lost for each death, which decreases to 9.2 years per death after adjusting for 11 comorbidities. The expected number of years lost implied by the life table, reflecting the mortality of a developed country just before the pandemic is 11.1 years. The years of life lost due to COVID-19 in Hungary is therefore 12% or 1.3 years per death lower when accounting for the comorbidities and is below its expected value, but how this should be interpreted is still a matter of debate.

METHODS: 11 CL attending surveys and 8 attendings' tele-encounter logs from March-June 2020 were completed and reviewed to assess for patient and provider characteristics associated with barriers to using telepsychiatry. RESULTS: The vast majority of 223 tele-psychiatric encounters were acceptable to providers in terms of technology (82%) and their ability to form a connection with the patient (78%). In multivariable logistic regression models, an unresolvable difficulty utilizing the platform was less common for female patients (OR = 0.239, p = 0.002) and more common for patients who prefer a non-English language (OR = 9.059, p < 0.001); achieving a personal connection that felt right was also less likely for patients who prefer a non-English language (OR = 0.189, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Telepsychiatry has previously been limited to outpatient use and, generally, for providers and patients who specifically preferred it. However, abrupt transition to use of telepsychiatry to limit contagion risk was mostly satisfactory in our center; identifying for which patient encounters it is most and least appropriate will help guide future use.","Cheung, Stephanie G; Capote, Justin; Fan, Weijia; Mishkin, Adrienne D",,368,24

The objective of this study is to explore risk factors for 28-day mortality of COVID-19 patients receiving invasive ventilation. Methods: 74 consecutive adult invasively ventilated COVID-19 patients were included in this retrospective study. The demographic and clinical data were compared between survivors and non-survivors, and Cox regression analysis was used to explore risk factors for 28-day mortality. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality after initiation of invasive ventilation. Secondary outcome was the time from admission to intubation. Results: Of 74 patients with COVID-19, the median age was 68.0 years, 53 (71.6%) were male, 47 (63.5%) had comorbidities with hypertension, and diabetes commonly presented. The most frequent symptoms were fever and dyspnea. The median time from hospital admission to intubation was similar in survivors and non-survivors (6.5 days vs. 5.0 days). The 28-day mortality was 81.1%. High Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score (hazard ratio [HR], 1.54; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.23-1.92; p < 0.001) and longer time from hospital admission to intubation (HR, 2.41; 95% CI, 1.15-5.07; p = 0.020) were associated with 28-day mortality in invasively ventilated COVID-19 patients.

The repurposing of drugs that are approved or are under advanced clinical investigation provides a cost- and time-effective therapeutic solution. This review summarizes the major repurposed approaches that have been proposed or are already being studied in clinical trials for COVID-19. Among these approaches are drugs that aim to reduce SARS-CoV-2 replication by targeting either viral enzymatic functions or cellular factors required for the viral life cycle. Drugs that modulate the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection by boosting it to enhance viral clearance or by suppressing it to prevent excessive inflammation and tissue injury represent another category.

MethodWe mapped the distribution of Aotearoas population and used the enhanced-two-step-floating-catchment-method (E2SFCA) to estimate spatial access to vaccination services, taking into account service supply, population demand, and distance between populations and services. We used the Gini coefficient and both global and local measures of spatial autocorrelation to assess the spatial equity of vaccination services across Aotearoa. Additional statistics included an analysis of spatial accessibility for priority populations, including M[a]ori (Indigenous people of Aotearoa), Pacific, over 65-year-olds, and people living in areas of high socioeconomic deprivation. We also examined vaccination service access according to rurality, and by District Health Board region. ResultsSpatially accessibility to vaccination services varies across Aotearoa, and appears to be better in major cities than rural regions. A Gini coefficient of 0.426 confirms that spatial accessibility scores are not shared equally across the vaccine-eligible population. Furthermore, priority populations including M[a]ori, older people, and residents of areas with socioeconomic constraint have, on average, statistically significantly lower spatial access to vaccination services. This is also true for people living in rural areas. Spatial access to vaccination services, also varies significantly by District Health Board (DHB) region as does equality of access, and the proportion of DHB priority population groups living in areas with poor access to vaccination services. A strong and significant positive correlation was identified between average spatial accessibility and the M[a]ori vaccination rate ratio of DHBs. ConclusionCovid-19 vaccination services in Aotearoa are not equitably distributed. Priority populations, with the most pressing need to receive Covid-19 vaccinations, have the worst access to vaccination services.","Whitehead, Jesse; Carr, Polly Atatoa; Scott, Nina; Lawrenson, Ross",,368,22

Among the total 668 seropositive participants, 433 (64.8%) had previously been tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, and 50.0% had a positive RT-PCR result. CONCLUSIONS: We found large differences in the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in staff working in the healthcare sector within a small geographical area of Denmark. Half of all seropositive staff had been tested positive by PCR prior to this survey. This study raises awareness of precautions which should be taken to avoid in-hospital transmission. Regular testing of healthcare workers for SARS-CoV-2 should be considered to identify areas with increased transmission.","Jespersen, Sanne; Mikkelsen, Susan; Greve, Thomas; Kaspersen, Kathrine Agergård; Tolstrup, Martin; Boldsen, Jens Kjærgaard; Redder, Jacob Dvinge; Nielsen, Kent; Abildgaard, Anders Mønsted; Kolstad, Henrik Albert; Østergaard, Lars; Thomsen, Marianne Kragh; Møller, Holger Jon; Erikstrup, Christian",Clin. infect. dis,368,10

Based on the potent immunomodulatory properties of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), a growing number of trials are ongoing. This prompted us to carry out a thorough immunological study in a patient treated with umbilical cord-derived MSCs and admitted to the Intensive Care Unit for COVID-19-related pneumonia. The exploratory analyses were assessed on both peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar fluid lavage samples at baseline and after cellular infusion by means of single-cell RNA sequencing, flow cytometry, ELISA, and functional assays. Remarkably, a normalization of circulating T lymphocytes count paralleled by a reduction of inflammatory myeloid cells, and a decrease in serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, mostly of interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-&#945;, were observed. In addition, a drop of plasma levels of those chemokines essential for neutrophil recruitment became evident that paralleled the decrease of lung-infiltrating inflammatory neutrophils. Finally, circulating monocytes and low-density gradient neutrophils acquired immunosuppressive function. This scenario was accompanied by an amelioration of respiratory, renal, inflammatory, and pro-thrombotic indexes. Our results provide the first immunological data possibly related to the use of umbilical cord-derived MSCs in severe COVID-19 context.","Ciccocioppo, Rachele; Gibellini, Davide; Astori, Giuseppe; Bernardi, Martina; Bozza, Angela; Chieregato, Katia; Elice, Francesca; Ugel, Stefano; Caligola, Simone; De Sanctis, Francesco; Canè, Stefania; Fiore, Alessandra; Trovato, Rosalinda; Vella, Antonio; Petrova, Varvara; Amodeo, Giuseppe; Santimaria, Monica; Mazzariol, Annarita; Frulloni, Luca; Ruggeri, Marco; Polati, Enrico; Bronte, Vincenzo",Stem Cell Res Ther,368,1

A number of promising vaccines have been recently developed as a protective measure; however, cost-effective treatments are also of great importance to support this critical situation. Previously, betulinic acid has shown promising antiviral activity against SARS CoV via targeting its main protease. Herein, we investigated the inhibitory potential of this compound together with three other triterpene congeners (i.e., ursolic acid, maslinic acid, and betulin) derived from olive leaves against the viral main protease (Mpro) of the currently widespread SARS CoV-2. Interestingly, betulinic, ursolic, and maslinic acids showed significant inhibitory activity (IC50 = 3.22-14.55 µM), while betulin was far less active (IC50 = 89.67 µM). A comprehensive in-silico analysis (i.e., ensemble docking, molecular dynamic simulation, and binding-free energy calculation) was then performed to describe the binding mode of these compounds with the enzyme catalytic active site and determine the main essential structural features required for their inhibitory activity. Results presented in this communication indicated that this class of compounds could be considered as a promising lead scaffold for developing cost-effective anti-SARS CoV-2 therapeutics.","Alhadrami, Hani A; Sayed, Ahmed M; Sharif, Ahmed M; Azhar, Esam I; Rateb, Mostafa E",Molecules (Basel),368,16

Rapid, accurate, and easily configurable molecular diagnostic tests are imperative to prevent global spread of new diseases. CRISPR-based diagnostic approaches are proving to be useful as field-deployable solutions. In one basic form of this assay, the CRISPR-Cas12 enzyme complexes with a synthetic guide RNA (gRNA). This complex becomes activated only when it specifically binds to target DNA and cleaves it. The activated complex thereafter nonspecifically cleaves single-stranded DNA reporter probes labeled with a fluorophore-quencher pair. We discovered that electric field gradients can be used to control and accelerate this CRISPR assay by cofocusing Cas12-gRNA, reporters, and target within a microfluidic chip. We achieve an appropriate electric field gradient using a selective ionic focusing technique known as isotachophoresis (ITP) implemented on a microfluidic chip. Unlike previous CRISPR diagnostic assays, we also use ITP for automated purification of target RNA from raw nasopharyngeal swab samples. We here combine this ITP purification with loop-mediated isothermal amplification and the ITP-enhanced CRISPR assay to achieve detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA (from raw sample to result) in about 35 min for both contrived and clinical nasopharyngeal swab samples. This electric field control enables an alternate modality for a suite of microfluidic CRISPR-based diagnostic assays.","Ramachandran, Ashwin; Huyke, Diego A; Sharma, Eesha; Sahoo, Malaya K; Huang, ChunHong; Banaei, Niaz; Pinsky, Benjamin A; Santiago, Juan G",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,368,18

High sensitivity of optimized real-time RT-PCR assays makes pooled testing a potentially efficient strategy for resource utilization when positivity rates for particular regions or groups of individuals are low. We report here a comparative analysis of pooled testing for 5- and 10-sample pools by real-time RT-PCR across 10 COVID-19 testing laboratories in India. METHODS: Ten virus research and diagnostic laboratories (VRDLs) testing for COVID-19 by real-time RT-PCR participated in this evaluation. At each laboratory, 100 nasopharyngeal swab samples including 10 positive samples were used to create 5- and 10-sample pools with one positive sample in each pool. RNA extraction and real-time RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2-specific E gene target were performed for individual positive samples as well as pooled samples. Concordance between individual sample testing and testing in the 5- or 10-sample pools was calculated, and the variation across sites and by sample cycle threshold (C(t)) values was analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 110 each of 5- and 10-sample pools were evaluated. Concordance between the 5-sample pool and individual sample testing was 100 per cent in the C(t) value ≤30 cycles and 95.5 per cent for C(t) values ≤33 cycles. Overall concordance between the 5-sample pooled and individual sample testing was 88 per cent while that between 10-sample pool and individual sample testing was 66 per cent. Although the concordance rates for both the 5- and 10-sample pooled testing varied across laboratories, yet for samples with C(t) values ≤33 cycles, the concordance was ≥90 per cent across all laboratories for the 5-sample pools. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: Results from this multi-site assessment suggest that pooling five samples for SARS-CoV-2 detection by real-time RT-PCR may be an acceptable strategy without much loss of sensitivity even for low viral loads, while with 10-sample pools, there may be considerably higher numbers of false negatives. However, testing laboratories should perform validations with the specific RNA extraction and RT-PCR kits in use at their centres before initiating pooled testing.","Praharaj, Ira; Jain, Amita; Singh, Mini; Balakrishnan, Anukumar; Dhodapkar, Rahul; Borkakoty, Biswajyoti; Ashok, Munivenkatappa; Das, Pradeep; Biswas, Debasis; Kalawat, Usha; Turuk, Jyotirmayee; Sugunan, A.P.; Prakash, Shantanu; Singh, Anirudh K.; Barathidasan, Rajamani; Subhadra, Subhra; Sabat, Jyotsnamayee; Manjunath, M.J.; Kanta, Poonam; Mudhigeti, Nagaraja; Hazarika, Rahul; Mishra, Hricha; Abhishek, Kumar; Santhalembi, C.; Dikhit, Manas Ranjan; Vijay, Neetu; Narayan, Jitendra; Kaur, Harmanmeet; Giri, Sidhartha; Gupta, Nivedita",Indian J Med Res,368,16

This novel virus is thought to have originated from an animal reservoir, and acquired the ability to infect human cells using the SARS-CoV cell receptor hACE2. In the wake of a global pandemic it is essential to improve our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics surrounding the origin and spread of a novel infectious disease. One way theory predicts selection pressures should shape viral evolution is to enhance binding with host cells. We first assessed evolutionary dynamics in select betacoronavirus spike protein genes to predict where these genomic regions are under directional or purifying selection between divergent viral lineages at various scales of relatedness. With this analysis, we determine a region inside the receptor-binding domain with putative sites under positive selection interspersed among highly conserved sites, which are implicated in structural stability of the viral spike protein and its union with human receptor hACE2. Next, to gain further insights into factors associated with coronaviruses recognition of the human host receptor, we performed modeling studies of five different coronaviruses and their potential binding to hACE2. Modeling results indicate that interfering with the salt bridges at hot spot 353 could be an effective strategy for inhibiting binding, and hence for the prevention of coronavirus infections. We also propose that a glycine residue at the receptor binding domain of the spike glycoprotein can have a critical role in permitting bat variants of the coronaviruses to infect human cells.","Armijos-Jaramillo, Vinicio; Yeager, Justin; Muslin, Claire; Perez-Castillo, Yunierkis",bioRxiv,368,33

Fisheries around the world are not an exception due to the long-term isolation and the non-activities period suffered. To do an evaluation of its impact on the fishing sectors in the Canary Islands, 87 online and phone questionnaires were carried out between July and September 2020, conducting the interviews to artisanal fishermen, fishmongers, recreational charter boats fishermen and tackle shops along the archipelago. Both, the artisanal and recreational fishing sectors have been affected by this pandemic, but in an unequal manner. The drop of the demand of fresh fishing products in the islands markets due to the closure of hotels, restaurants and other services, and the highly significant decreasing in the number of tourists, provoked an estimated income loss for the artisanal fishermen about the 40% on average, but the majority of vessels continued their activities during the pandemic, with very limited effects on direct employment. However, the fishmonger’s activity apparently was not affected and increased their monthly income in relation to the previous year. Likewise, the infeasibility of fishing charter companies due to the great reduction in the number of tourists contrasted with the significant increase in the number of recreational fishing licenses immediately after the confinement ended. Even though that fishing tackle shops increased sales by over 60% in relation to the similar period of the year before, only 4.4% of these shops declared not to have had economic losses.","Guerra-Marrero, Airam; Couce-Montero, Lorena; Jiménez-Alvarado, David; Espino-Ruano, Ana; Núñez-González, Raibel; Sarmiento-Lezcano, Airam; Santana del Pino, Ángelo; Castro, José J.",Mar Policy,368,1

Typical presenting symptoms include fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and hypoxia. However, several other symptoms have been reported, including fatigue, weakness, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. We have identified a series of patients with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) likely precipitated by COVID-19. Case Series We describe five patients with previously known type 2 diabetes and no history of DKA, who presented to the emergency department with new-onset DKA and COVID-19. Why should an emergency physician be aware of this? Diabetes mellitus is a known risk factor for poor outcomes in viral respiratory illnesses, including COVID-19. Infection may precipitate DKA in patients with type 2 diabetes. Aggressive management of these patients is recommended; however, management guidelines have not yet been put forth for this unique subset of patients.","Croft, Alexander; Bucca, Antonino; Jansen, Jaclyn H.; Motzkus, Christine; Herbert, Audrey; Wang, Alfred; Hunter, Benton R.",J Emerg Med,368,18

The COVID-19 virus is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus with a genome size of ~29.9 kb. It is believed that the viral spike (S) protein attaches to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 cell surface receptors and, eventually, the virus gains access into the host cell with the help of intracellular/extracellular proteases or by the endosomal pathway. Once, the virus enters the host cell, it can either be degraded via autophagy or evade autophagic degradation and replicate using the virus encoded RNA dependent RNA polymerase. The virus is highly contagious and can impair the respiratory system of the host causing dyspnea, cough, fever, and tightness in the chest. This disease is also characterized by an abrupt upsurge in the levels of proinflammatory/inflammatory cytokines and chemotactic factors in a process known as cytokine storm. Certain reports have suggested that COVID-19 infection can aggravate cardiovascular complications, in fact, the individuals with underlying co-morbidities are more prone to the disease. In this review, we shall discuss the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, potential drug candidates, the interaction between virus and autophagy, and the role of coronavirus in exaggerating cardiovascular complications.","Randhawa, Puneet Kaur; Scanlon, Kaylyn; Rappaport, Jay; Gupta, Manish K.",Front Physiol,368,30

We aimed to assess the association of NIV versus MV with mortality and morbidity during respiratory intervention among hypoxemic patients admitted with COVID-19. METHODS: We performed a retrospective multi-center cohort study across 5 hospitals during March–April 2020. Outcomes included mortality, severe COVID-19-related symptoms, time to discharge, and final oxygen saturation (SpO2) at the conclusion of the respiratory intervention. Multivariable regression of outcomes was conducted in all hypoxemic participants, 4 subgroups, and propensity-matched analysis. RESULTS: Of 2381 participants with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2, 688 were included in the study who were hypoxemic upon initiation of respiratory intervention. During the study period, 299 participants died (43%), 163 were admitted to the ICU (24%), and 121 experienced severe COVID-19-related symptoms (18%). Participants on MV had increased mortality than those on NIV (128/154 [83%] versus 171/534 [32%], OR = 30, 95% CI 16–60) with a mean survival of 6 versus 15 days, respectively. The MV group experienced more severe COVID-19-related symptoms [55/154 (36%) versus 66/534 (12%), OR = 4.3, 95% CI 2.7–6.8], longer time to discharge (mean 17 versus 7.1 days), and lower final SpO2 (92 versus 94%). Across all subgroups and propensity-matched analysis, MV was associated with a greater OR of death than NIV. CONCLUSIONS: NIV was associated with lower respiratory intervention mortality and morbidity than MV. However, findings may be liable to unmeasured confounding and further study from randomized controlled trials is needed to definitively determine the role of NIV in hypoxemic patients with COVID-19.

A large challenge lies in how policies to improve detection, diagnosis and treatment completion interact with social and structural drivers of TB. Detailed understanding and theoretical development of the contextual determinants of problems in TB care is required for developing effective interventions. This article reports findings from the pre-implementation phase of a study of TB care in South Africa, contributing to HeAlth System StrEngThening in Sub-Saharan Africa (ASSET)—a five-year research programme developing and evaluating health system strengthening interventions in sub-Saharan Africa. The study aimed to develop hypothetical propositions regarding contextual determinants of problems in TB care to inform intervention development to reduce TB deaths and incidence whilst ensuring the delivery of quality integrated, person-centred care. METHODS: Theory-building case study design using the Context and Implementation of Complex Interventions (CICI) framework to identify contextual determinants of problems in TB care. Between February and November 2019, we used mixed methods in six public-sector primary healthcare facilities and one public-sector hospital serving impoverished urban and rural communities in the Amajuba District of KwaZulu-Natal Province, South Africa. Qualitative data included stakeholder interviews, observations and documentary analysis. Quantitative data included routine data on sputum testing and TB deaths. Data were inductively analysed and mapped onto the seven CICI contextual domains. RESULTS: Delayed diagnosis was caused by interactions between fragmented healthcare provision; limited resources; verticalised care; poor TB screening, sputum collection and record-keeping. One nurse responsible for TB care, with limited integration of TB with other conditions, and policy focused on treatment adherence contributed to staff stress and limited consideration of patients’ psychosocial needs. Patients were lost to follow up due to discontinuity of information, poverty, employment restrictions and limited support for treatment side-effects. Infection control measures appeared to be compromised by efforts to integrate care. CONCLUSIONS: Delayed diagnosis, limited psychosocial support for patients and staff, patients lost to follow-up and inadequate infection control are caused by an interaction between multiple interacting contextual determinants. TB policy needs to resolve tensions between treating TB as epidemic and individually-experienced social problem, supporting interventions which strengthen case detection, infection control and treatment, and also promote person-centred support for healthcare professionals and patients.

This impact is mediated both by the intrinsic nutritional and biochemical qualities of the diet, and by its influence on the intestinal microbiota. Fish as a food is rich in compounds with immunoregulatory properties, among them omega-3 fatty acids, melatonin, tryptophan, taurine and polyamines. In addition, regular fish consumption favors the proliferation of beneficial members of the intestinal microbiota, like short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria. By substituting arachidonic acid in the eicosanoid biosynthesis pathway, long-chain omega-3 fatty acids from fish change the type of prostaglandins, leukotrienes and thromboxanes being produced, resulting in anti-inflammatory properties. Further, they also are substrates for the production of specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) (resolvins, protectins, and maresins), lipid compounds that constitute the physiological feedback signal to stop inflammation and give way to tissue reparation. Evidence from human observational and interventional studies shows that regular fish consumption is associated with reduced incidence of chronic inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, and that continuous infusion of fish oil to tube-fed, critically ill patients may improve important outcomes in the ICU. There is also evidence from animal models showing that larger systemic concentrations of omega-3 fatty acids may counter the pathophysiological cascade that leads to psoriasis. The knowledge gained over the last few decades merits future exploration of the potential role of fish and its components in other conditions characterized by deregulated activation of immune cells and a cytokine storm like viral sepsis or COVID-19.","Mendivil, Carlos O.",Front Nutr,368,16

However, little is known about how to effectively encourage large numbers of residents to reach out to others about conservation causes. We examined the influence of normative and efficacy‐based messaging at motivating residents to engage in and to encourage others to participate in native plant gardening in their community. To do so, we conducted a field experiment with messages on mailings and tracked native plant vouchers used. Efficacy messages tended to be more effective than normative messages at increasing residents’ willingness to reach out to others to encourage conservation action, as indicated by a several percentage point increase in native plant voucher use by residents’ friends and neighbors. Messages sometimes had different impacts on residents based on past behaviors and perceptions related to native plant gardening. Among these subgroups, efficacy and combined efficacy and norm messages most effectively encouraged individual and collective actions, as indicated by increased voucher usage. Our findings suggest that interventions that build residents’ efficacy for engaging in a conservation behavior and for reaching out to others may be a promising path forward for outreach. However, given our results were significant at a false discovery rate cutoff of 0.25 but not 0.05, more experimental trials are needed to determine the robustness of these trends.","Niemiec, Rebecca; Jones, Megan S.; Lischka, Stacy; Champine, Veronica",Conserv Biol,368,32

The entry of 3PPs into supply chains, not only changes the cash flow, but also decreases consumer price sensitivity and stimulates demand by facilitating credit consumptions. Moreover, information sharing becomes more feasible with the help of 3PPs. To study the impacts of 3PP entry, we build game-theoretic models in a supply chain consisting of a manufacturer, a retailer and a 3PP, and derive the equilibrium in both the non-information sharing and information sharing cases. We show that the 3PP should make a reasonable commission rate which can lure the retailer to introduce the 3PP as well as maintain the 3PP’s profitability. The 3PP entry allows the retailer to set a higher price without decreasing the demand. However, to seize all of the benefit of the 3PP entry, the first mover manufacturer increases the wholesale price to a large extent. As a result, the 3PP entry causes a win-lose situation for the manufacturer and the retailer. The supply chain can be better off from the 3PP entry if it can significantly decrease consumer price sensitivity or its fixed investment cost is low. Furthermore, we find that information sharing benefits the manufacturer and the 3PP but harms the retailer. While information sharing always decreases the expected profit for the supply chain without the 3PP, it may increase that for the supply chain with the 3PP. To improve the supply chain profitability, we suggest to provide incentives for retailer information sharing if the 3PP can significantly decrease consumer price sensitivity (i.e., the proportion of the 3PP users is higher, the grace period of credit consumption is lower, or the cash opportunity cost is lower).","Fan, Xiaojun; Zhao, Wenyu; Zhang, Ting; Yan, Endian",Ann Oper Res,368,28

The time before desaturation occurs can be prolonged by applying high flow oxygen into the airway. Aim of this study was to scientifically assess the flow that is necessary to avoid nitrogen entering the airway of a manikin model during application of pure oxygen via high flow nasal oxygen. METHODS: We measured oxygen content over a 20-min observation period for each method in a preoxygenated test lung applied to a human manikin, allowing either room air entering the airway in control group, or applying pure oxygen via high flow nasal oxygen at flows of 10, 20, 40, 60 and 80 L/min via nasal cannula in the other groups. Our formal hypothesis was that there would be no difference in oxygen fraction decrease between the groups. RESULTS: Oxygen content in the test lung dropped from 97 ± 1% at baseline in all groups to 43 ± 1% in the control group (p < 0.001 compared to all other groups), to 92 ± 1% in the 10 L/min group, 92 ± 1% in the 20 L/min group, 90 ± 1% in the 40 L/min group, 89 ± 0% in the 60 L/min group and 87 ± 0% in the 80 L/min group.

Pathogen photoinactivation efficacy depends critically on UV-C dose, which is distance- and angle-dependent and thus varies substantially across N95 surfaces within a decontamination system. Due to nonuniform and system-dependent UV-C dose distributions, characterizing UV-C dose and resulting pathogen inactivation with sufficient spatial resolution on-N95 is key to designing and validating UV-C decontamination protocols. However, robust quantification of UV-C dose across N95 facepieces presents challenges, as few UV-C measurement tools have sufficient (1) small, flexible form factor, and (2) angular response. To address this gap, we combine optical modeling and quantitative photochromic indicator (PCI) dosimetry with viral inactivation assays to generate high-resolution maps of “on-N95” UV-C dose and concomitant SARS-CoV-2 viral inactivation across N95 facepieces within a commercial decontamination chamber. Using modeling to rapidly identify on-N95 locations of interest, in-situ measurements report a 17.4 ± 5.0-fold dose difference across N95 facepieces in the chamber, yielding 2.9 ± 0.2-log variation in SARS-CoV-2 inactivation. UV-C dose at several on-N95 locations was lower than the lowest-dose locations on the chamber floor, highlighting the importance of on-N95 dose validation. Overall, we integrate optical simulation with in-situ PCI dosimetry to relate UV-C dose and viral inactivation at specific on-N95 locations, establishing a versatile approach to characterize UV-C photoinactivation of pathogens contaminating complex substrates such as N95s.","Geldert, Alisha; Su, Alison; Roberts, Allison W.; Golovkine, Guillaume; Grist, Samantha M.; Stanley, Sarah A.; Herr, Amy E.",Sci Rep,368,26

Some people with disability are at greater risk of contracting COVID-19 because they require support for personal care and are unable to physically distance, e.g. those living in congregate settings. Additionally, some people with disability have health conditions that put them at higher risk of poor outcomes if they become infected. Despite this, governments have been slow to recognise, and respond to, the unique and diverse health care needs of people with disability during COVID-19. While some countries, including Australia, have improved access to high-quality health care for people with disability others, like England, have failed to support their citizens with disability.

However, the association between distancing and patient-centered outcomes in Covid-19 has not been demonstrated. In the United States social distancing orders are implemented at the state level with variable timing of onset. Emergency declarations and school closures were two early statewide interventions. METHODS: To determine whether later distancing interventions were associated with higher mortality, we performed a state-level analysis in 55,146 Covid-19 non-survivors. We tested the association between timing of emergency declarations and school closures with 28-day mortality using multivariable negative binomial regression. Day 1 for each state was set to when they recorded ≥ 10 deaths. We performed sensitivity analyses to test model assumptions. RESULTS: At time of analysis, 37 of 50 states had ≥ 10 deaths and 28 follow-up days. Both later emergency declaration (adjusted mortality rate ratio [aMRR] 1.05 per day delay, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.09, p=0.040) and later school closure (aMRR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.09, p=0.008) were associated with more deaths. When assessing all 50 states and setting day 1 to the day a state recorded its first death, delays in declaring an emergency (aMRR 1.05, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.09, p=0.020) or closing schools (aMRR 1.06, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.09, p<0.001) were associated with more deaths. Results were unchanged when excluding New York and New Jersey. CONCLUSIONS: Later statewide emergency declarations and school closure were associated with higher Covid-19 mortality.

Most of the research on sustainability has a business-to-consumer focus, with limited research emphasizing sustainability in the context of business-to-business marketing. The paper examines research on sustainability, published in the journal Industrial Marketing Management, where thirty-eight articles have appeared in the past twenty-seven years, the majority on supply-chain research. Research on sustainability in business-to-business markets is sparse, and some of the fundamental research questions in this area have gone unaddressed. This paper addresses three interrelated research issues associated with sustainability in business-to-business markets. First, what research is available to researchers and practitioners? Second, what framework can be used to examine sustainability research in business-to-business markets? Third, what subareas of sustainability research need focus and deeper examination, and what are the associated research questions? Overall, the findings from this paper suggest the need for additional research in the area because of its substantial implications for theory, research, and practice.","Sharma, Arun",Industrial Marketing Management,368,28

MK-p10 S protein had four mutations relative to the original virus S, and one of these (H → R at position 1381, H1381R) in the cytoplasmic tail (CT) was suggested to be responsible for the increased fusion activity. To explore this, we examined fusion activity using recombinant S proteins. We expressed and compared the fusion activity of MK-p10 S, S with the H1381R mutation, S with the three other mutations that were not thought to be involved in high fusion activity, and the original S protein. The MK-p10 and MK-H1381R S proteins induced larger cell fusions than others. We also examined the distribution of these S proteins; the MK-p10 and MK-H1381R S proteins were transported onto the cell surface more efficiently than others. These findings suggest that the H1381R mutation is responsible for enhanced fusion activity, which may be attributed to the efficient transfer of S onto the cell surface. H1381 is a component of the KxHxx motif in the CT region, which is a retrieval signal of the S protein for the endoplasmic reticulum–Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). Loss of this motif could allow for the efficient transfer of S proteins from ERGIC onto the cell surface and subsequent increased fusion activity.","Shirato, Kazuya; Maejima, Madoka; Matsuyama, Shutoku; Ujike, Makoto; Miyazaki, Ayako; Takeyama, Natsumi; Ikeda, Hidetoshi; Taguchi, Fumihiro",Virus Res,368,16

The severity of the illness can also extend from mild disease to life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). SARS-CoV-2 infection can also affect the gastrointestinal tract, liver and pancreatic functions, leading to gastrointestinal symptoms. Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 can cause central and peripheral neurological manifestations, affect the cardiovascular system and promote renal dysfunction. Epidemiological data have indicated that cancer patients are at a higher risk of contracting the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Considering the multitude of clinical symptoms of COVID-19, the objective of the present review was to summarize their pathophysiology in previously healthy patients, as well as in those with comorbidities. The present review summarizes the current, though admittedly fluid knowledge on the pathophysiology and symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Although unclear issues still remain, the present study contributes to a more complete understanding of the disease, and may drive the direction of new research.

Consequently, considerable effort has been invested in developing more evolutionarily robust vaccines, either by targeting highly conserved components of the pathogen (universal vaccines) or by including multiple immunological targets within a single vaccine (multi‐epitope vaccines). An unexplored third possibility is to vaccinate individuals with one of a number of qualitatively different vaccines, creating a “mosaic” of individual immunity in the population. Here we explore whether a mosaic vaccination strategy can deliver superior epidemiological outcomes to “conventional” vaccination, in which all individuals receive the same vaccine. We suppose vaccine doses can be distributed between distinct vaccine “targets” (e.g., different surface proteins against which an immune response can be generated) and/or immunologically distinct variants at these targets (e.g., strains); the pathogen can undergo antigenic evolution at both targets. Using simple mathematical models, here we provide a proof‐of‐concept that mosaic vaccination often outperforms conventional vaccination, leading to fewer infected individuals, improved vaccine efficacy, and lower individual risks over the course of the epidemic.","McLeod, David V.; Wahl, Lindi M.; Mideo, Nicole",Evol Lett,368,10

We now report that an HCoV-OC43 mutant harboring two persistence-associated S glycoprotein point mutations (H183R and Y241H), induced a stronger unfolded protein response (UPR) and translation attenuation in infected human neurons. There was a major contribution of the IRE1/XBP1 pathway, followed by caspase-3 activation and nuclear fragmentation, with no significant role of the ATF6 and eIF2-alpha/ATF4 pathways. Our results show the importance of discrete molecular viral S determinants in virus–neuronal cell interactions that lead to increased production of viral proteins and infectious particles, enhanced UPR activation, and increased cytotoxicity and cell death. As this mutant virus is more neurovirulent in mice, our results also suggest that two mutations in the S glycoprotein could eventually modulate viral neuropathogenesis.","Favreau, Dominique J.; Desforges, Marc; St-Jean, Julien R.; Talbot, Pierre J.",Virology,368,1

However, the majority of these studies were conducted among primarily White, relatively advantaged populations and in well-resourced settings. OBJECTIVE We conducted a qualitative, theory-informed implementation science study to assess the readiness for VR in safety-net settings. METHODS Using the theoretical lens of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) framework, we conducted semistructured interviews with current VR users and nonusers based in safety-net health systems (n=15). We investigated barriers and facilitators to a commercially available, previously validated VR technology platform AppliedVR (Los Angeles, CA, USA). We used deductive qualitative analysis using the overarching domains of the CFIR framework and performed open, inductive coding to identify specific themes within each domain. RESULTS Interviewees deemed the VR intervention to be useful, scalable, and an appealing alternative to existing pain management approaches. Both users and nonusers identified a lack of reimbursement for VR as a significant challenge for adoption. Current users cited positive patient feedback, but safety-net stakeholders voiced concern that existing VR content may not be relevant or appealing to diverse patients. All respondents acknowledged the challenge of integrating and maintaining VR in current pain management workflows across a range of clinical settings, and this adoption challenge was particularly acute, given resource and staffing constraints in safety-net settings. CONCLUSIONS VR for pain management holds interest for frontline pain management clinicians and leadership in safety-net health settings but will require significant tailoring and adaption to address the needs of diverse populations. Integration into complex workflows for pain management is a significant barrier to adoption, and participants cited structural cost and reimbursement concerns as impediments to initial implementation and scaling of VR use.","Sarkar, Urmimala; Lee, Jane E; Nguyen, Kim H; Lisker, Sarah; Lyles, Courtney R",Journal of medical Internet research,368,11

Besides pigmentary effects generated by α-Melanocytic Hormone (α-MSH), new physiologic roles in sexual activity, exocrine secretion, energy homeostasis, as well as immunomodulatory actions, exerted by melanocortins, have been described recently. Among the most common and burdensome consequences of chronic inflammation is the development of fibrosis. Depending on the regenerative capacity of the affected tissue and the quality of the inflammatory response, the outcome is not always perfect, with the development of some fibrosis. Despite the heterogeneous etiology and clinical presentations, fibrosis in many pathological states follows the same path of activation or migration of fibroblasts, and the differentiation of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, which produce collagen and α-SMA in fibrosing tissue. The melanocortin agonists might have favorable effects on the trajectories leading from tissue injury to inflammation, from inflammation to fibrosis, and from fibrosis to organ dysfunction. In this review we briefly summarized the data on structure, receptor signaling, and anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties of α-MSH and proposed that α-MSH analogues might be promising future therapeutic candidates for inflammatory and fibrotic diseases, regarding their favorable safety profile.","Dinparastisaleh, Roshan; Mirsaeidi, Mehdi",Pharmaceuticals (Basel),368,22

The purification methods included sucrose gradient and Sephacryl S-1000 size-exclusion chromatography. Ultracentrifugation through a cushion of 60% sucrose solution was better than the other two methods for concentration of TCoV from intestinal homogenate. The most effective method for purifying TCoV and removing extraneous materials was size-exclusion chromatography as analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. More spike-rich particles were observed in the sample purified by chromatography than those purified by sucrose gradient as examined by electron microscopy.

Remdesivir (GS-5734) is the first approved treatment for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is a novel nucleoside analog with a broad antiviral activity spectrum among RNA viruses, including ebolavirus (EBOV) and the respiratory pathogens Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. First described in 2016, the drug was derived from an antiviral library of small molecules intended to target emerging pathogenic RNA viruses. In vivo, remdesivir showed therapeutic and prophylactic effects in animal models of EBOV, MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the substance failed in a clinical trial on ebolavirus disease (EVD), where it was inferior to investigational monoclonal antibodies in an interim analysis. As there was no placebo control in this study, no conclusions on its efficacy in EVD can be made. In contrast, data from a placebo-controlled trial show beneficial effects for patients with COVID-19. Remdesivir reduces the time to recovery of hospitalized patients who require supplemental oxygen and may have a positive impact on mortality outcomes while having a favorable safety profile. Although this is an important milestone in the fight against COVID-19, approval of this drug will not be sufficient to solve the public health issues caused by the ongoing pandemic.

METHODS: This academic, matched-cohort study compared outcomes of 90 consecutive consenting patients with mild COVID-19 treated at home by their family physicians between October 2020 and January 2021 in Northern and Central Italy, according to the proposed recommendation algorithm, with outcomes for 90 age-, sex-, and comorbidities-matched patients who received other therapeutic regimens. Primary outcome was time to resolution of major symptoms. Secondary outcomes included prevention of hospitalisation. Analyses were by intention-to-treat. FINDINGS: All patients achieved complete remission. The median [IQR] time to resolution of major symptoms was 18 [14–23] days in the ‘recommended schedule' cohort and 14 [7–30] days in the matched ‘control’ cohort (p = 0·033). Other symptoms persisted in a lower percentage of patients in the ‘recommended’ than in the ‘control’ cohort (23·3% versus 73·3%, respectively, p<0·0001) and for a shorter period (p = 0·0107). Two patients in the ‘recommended’ cohort were hospitalised compared to 13 (14·4%) controls (p = 0·0103). The prevention algorithm reduced the days and cumulative costs of hospitalisation by >90%.

The first case of COVID-19 was identified in Lebanon on the 21(st) of February 2020, amid a national economic crisis. As the numbers of cases increased, ICU admissions and mortality rose, which led hospitals across Lebanon to take certain safety measures to contain the virus. The Naef K. Basile Cancer Institute (NKBCI) at the American University of Beirut Medical Center handles oncology outpatient visits and outpatient treatment protocol infusions. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the safety measures put forth by the NKBCI early in the pandemic. METHODS: Oncology patients are amongst the immunosuppressed population, who are at greatest risk of contracting COVID-19 and consequently suffering its complications. In this manuscript, we evaluated the precautionary measures implemented at the NKBCI of AUBMC from March 1(st) to May 31(st) of 2020, by surveying oncology patients on the telephone who had live and virtual appointments in both the oncology outpatient clinics and infusion unit. We conducted a prospective study of 670 oncology patients who had appointments at the NKBCI during this period and used their answers to draw responses about patient satisfaction towards those safety measures. RESULTS: Our results involved 387 responses of oncology patients who visited the NKBCI during the period of March 1(st) to May 31(st) of 2020. 99% of our respondents gave a rating of good to excellent with these new measures. The option of online consultation was given to 35% in the hematology group compared to 19% in those with solid tumors (p=0.001).

Of this group of patients, 22% faced problems with connectivity and 19% faced problems with online payment. CONCLUSION: NKBCI was competent in following the WHO guidelines in protecting the oncology patient population. Feedback collected from the surveys will be taken into account by the committee of the NKBCI to develop new safety measures that can better control viral spread while providing patient-centered medical care.","El Cheikh, Jean; El Warrak, Samantha; Ghaoui, Nohra; Al Chami, Farouk; Shahbaz, Maya; Chehayeb, Sarah; Saghir, Nagi; Bazarbachi, Ali; Taher, Ali",Front Oncol,368,1

In this landscape, the management of patients with chronic kidney disease, acute kidney injury or patients undergoing immunosuppressant therapies for kidney transplant or glomerular diseases, represent a clinical challenge for nephrologists, especially in patients with severe acute lung involvement. Therefore in this setting, due to the lack of anti-COVID treatment schedules, tailored management is mandatory to reduce the side effects, as consequence of impaired renal function and drugs interactions.

Tocilizumab, an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist, might improve outcomes by mitigating inflammation. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of patients admitted to the University of Washington Hospital system with COVID-19 and requiring supplemental oxygen. Outcomes included clinical improvement, defined as a two-point reduction in severity on a 6-point ordinal scale or discharge, and mortality within 28 days. We used Cox proportional-hazards models with propensity score inverse probability weighting to compare outcomes in patients who did and did not receive tocilizumab. Results We evaluated 43 patients who received tocilizumab and 45 who did not. Patients receiving tocilizumab were younger with fewer comorbidities but higher baseline oxygen requirements. Tocilizumab treatment was associated with reduced CRP, fibrinogen, and temperature, but there were no meaningful differences in Cox models of time to clinical improvement (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.92; 95% CI, 0.38-2.22) or mortality (aHR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.21-1.52). A numerically higher proportion of tocilizumab-treated patients had subsequent infections, transaminitis, and cytopenias.

The question has been raised on whether DPP4 modulation or inhibition may prevent infection and/or progression of the COVID‐19. A docked complex model of the SARS‐CoV‐2 spike glycoprotein and DPP4 has been proposed, showing a large interface between the proteins and proposing close similarity with other coronaviruses using DPP4 as functional receptor. In absence of experimental validation, these data should be interpreted with caution. Nevertheless, this observation may rise the question on whether DPP4 is directly involved in SARS‐CoV‐2 cell adhesion/virulence, and whether DPP4 inhibition might be a therapeutic strategy for preventing infection. Although a direct involvement of DPP4 in SARS‐CoV‐2 infection needs to be clarified, there is also evidence suggesting that DPP4i modulate inflammation and exert anti‐fibrotic activity. These properties may be of potential use for halting progression to the hyperinflammatory state associated with severe COVID‐19. Taken together these findings may suggest a potential role for DPP4 inhibition or modulation in one or more steps of COVID‐19 immunopathogenesis. This article is protected by copyright.

Currently, the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is poorly understood. During the course of COVID-19 infection, many patients experience deterioration, which might be associated with systemic inflammation and cytokine storm syndrome; however, other patients have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic. There are some suggestions that impaired cellular immunity through a reduction in Th1 response and IFNG (interferon gamma) expression, as well as cross-reactivity with common cold coronaviruses, might be involved in the differential COVID-19 course. Here, we show that CD4+ cells isolated from unexposed healthy donors that were differentiated towards the Th1 lineage in the presence of SARS-CoV-2 proteins exhibited induction of IFNG. Interestingly, the same cells induced to differentiate towards a Th17 lineage did not exhibit changes in IFNG expression or Th17-related cytokines. This suggests the cellular response to SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins is primarily associated with Th1 lymphocytes and may be dependent on past infections with common cold coronaviruses or vaccinations that induce unspecific cellular responses, e.g., BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guérin). Thus, our results might explain the high variability in the course of COVID-19 among populations of different countries.","Sałkowska, Anna; Karwaciak, Iwona; Karaś, Kaja; Dastych, Jarosław; Ratajewski, Marcin",Vaccines (Basel),368,0

METHODS: We searched relevant databases/websites (up to September 2020) and selected English-language RCT publications of remdesivir for COVID-19. We conducted meta-analysis using an inverse variance, random-effects model in addition to trial sequential analysis (TSA) for the efficacy outcomes: all-cause mortality, viral burden and clinical progression. Safety outcomes were diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting. We calculated the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for all outcomes. Statistical heterogeneity was calculated using the I(2) statistic. RESULTS: We included five RCTs (7540 participants) from 7237 citations. Most (80%) were of an unclear to high risk of bias. There was no evidence of a significant improvement with remdesivir (100 mg, 10 days) regarding all-cause mortality (RR 0.94, CI 0.82–1.07; I(2) = 0%; 4 RCTs; 7143 patients), clinical progression (RR 1.08, CI 0.99–1.18; I(2) = 70.4%; 3 RCTs; 1692 patients), or diarrhoea (RR 0.82, CI 0.40–1.66; I(2) = 0%; 2 RCTs; 630 patients). Nausea occurred more often with remdesivir (RR 2.77, CI 1.28–6.03; I(2) = 0%; 2 RCTs; 630 patients). TSA showed that the required information size was not reached for firm conclusions to be drawn. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: There is insufficient evidence to support the use of remdesivir for treatment of COVID-19. More high-quality RCTs are needed for a stronger evidence. Until then, remdesivir should remain an experimental drug for COVID-19.","Okoli, George N.; Rabbani, Rasheda; Copstein, Leslie; Al-Juboori, Amenah; Askin, Nicole; Abou-Setta, Ahmed M.",Infectious diseases,368,30

Unlike many other candidates being investigated, tizoxanide (the active metabolite of nitazoxanide) plasma concentrations achieve antiviral levels after administration of the approved dose, although higher doses are expected to be needed to maintain these concentrations across the dosing interval in the majority of patients. Here an LC-MS/MS assay is described that has been validated in accordance with Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines. Fundamental parameters have been evaluated, and these included accuracy, precision and sensitivity. The assay was validated for human plasma, mouse plasma and Dulbeccos Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM) containing varying concentrations of Foetal Bovine Serum (FBS). Matrix effects are a well-documented source of concern for chromatographic analysis, with the potential to impact various stages of the analytical process, including suppression or enhancement of ionisation. Therefore, a robustly validated LC-MS/MS analytical method is presented capable of quantifying tizoxanide in multiple matrices with minimal impact of matrix effects.

By contrast, stricter public health measures are in place in ‘red zones’, and mobility between red and green zones is restricted. France and Spain were among the first countries to introduce green zoning in April 2020. Subsequently, more and more countries followed suit and the European Commission advocated for the implementation of a European green zoning strategy, which has been supported by the EU member states. While there remain coordination problems, green zoning has proven to be an effective strategy for containing the spread of the virus and limiting its negative economic and social impact. This strategy should provide important lessons and prove useful in future outbreaks. Research in epidemiology indicates that thoroughly implemented and operationalised green zoning can prevent the spread of a transmittable disease that is poorly understood, highly virulent and potentially highly lethal. Finally, there is strong evidence that green zoning can reduce economic and societal damage as it avoids worst-in-class measures.","Oliu-Barton, Miquel; Pradelski, Bary",Health Policy,368,6

This project will be the first of its kind in aiming to implement a digital health literacy intervention, using smartphone and internet, to disadvantaged women through female community healthcare workers. Improved health literacy in women of reproductive years is known to promote maternal, child and family health overall. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study will include a baseline survey, a pre- and post-test survey and a 3-month lasting intervention on (1) hygiene and prevention and (2) coronavirus awareness and prevention. Women of reproductive years will be sampled from disadvantaged areas across the four provinces of Pakistan (Baluchistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and Sindh), and the selection criteria will be poor, semiliterate or illiterate, belonging to underdeveloped neighbourhoods devoid of universal healthcare coverage and dependent on free primary health services. A target of 1000 women will comprise the sample, with 500 women each assigned randomly to the intervention and control groups. Analysis of variance and multivariate analysis will be used for analysing the intervention’s effects compared with the control group.

Participants were screened with a modified donor history questionnaire and, if eligible, were asked for consent and tested for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (IgG and IgM). Participants positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG were referred for CCP collection. RESULTS: Of 179 patients screened, 128 completed serologic testing and 89 were referred for CCP donation. IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 were detected in 23 of 51 participants with suspected COVID-19 and 66 of 77 participants with self-reported COVID-19 confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The anti–SARS-CoV-2 IgG level met the US Food and Drug Administration criteria for “high-titer” CCP in 39% of participants confirmed by PCR, as measured by the Ortho VITROS IgG assay.

Our findings suggest that COVID-19’s basic reproductive number ([Formula: see text]) and other key signatures of outbreak intensity are defined by transmission between infected individuals and the environment. Summarizing, we propose that variation in environmental transmission may explain observed differences in disease dynamics from setting to setting, and can inform public health interventions.","Ogbunugafor, C.

Viruses must mutate to generate the ability to transfer to humans. A key factor is the diversity of species. With 1400 species of bats (20% of all species of mammals), the diversity of bats species is highly favorable to the emergence of new viruses. Moreover, several species of bats live within the same location, and share advanced social behavior, favoring the transmission of viruses. Because they fly, bats are also hosts for a wide range of viruses from many environments. They also eat everything (including what humans eat), they share humans’ environment and become closer to domestic species, which can serve as relays between bats and humans. Bats also have a long-life expectancy (up to 40 years for some bats), which is particularly effective for transmission to humans. However, a recent publication came out challenging what we think about bats. Proportionally, bats may not carry a higher number of zoonotic pathogens, normalized by species richness, compared to other mammalian and avian species. Viral zoonotic risk is homogenous among taxonomic orders of mammalian and avian reservoir hosts, without evidence that bats carry more viruses that infect humans.","Dutheil, Frédéric; Clinchamps, Maëlys; Bouillon-Minois, Jean-Baptiste",Pathogens,368,28

Unfractionated heparin (UFH) to prevent circuit clotting is mandatory but monitoring is complicated by (pseudo)-heparin resistance. In this observational study, we compared two different activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) assays and a chromogenic anti-Xa assay in COVID-19 patients on CRRT or ECMO in relation to their UFH dosages and acute phase reactants. Materials and Methods The aPTT (optical [aPTT-CS] and/or mechanical [aPTT-STA] clot detection methods were used), anti-Xa, factor VIII (FVIII), antithrombin III (ATIII), and fibrinogen were measured in 342 samples from 7 COVID-19 patients on CRRT or ECMO during their UFH treatment. Dosage of UFH was primarily based on the aPTT-CS with a heparin therapeutic range (HTR) of 50–80s. Associations between different variables were made using linear regression and Bland–Altman analysis. Results Dosage of UFH was above 35,000IU/24 hours in all patients. aPTT-CS and aPTT-STA were predominantly within the HTR. Anti-Xa was predominantly above the HTR (0.3–0.7 IU/mL) and ATIII concentration was >70% for all patients; mean FVIII and fibrinogen were 606% and 7.5 g/L, respectively. aPTT-CS correlated with aPTT-STA ( r (2) = 0.68) with a bias of 39.3%. Correlation between aPTT and anti-Xa was better for aPTT-CS (0.78 ≤ r (2) ≤ 0.94) than for aPTT-STA (0.34 ≤ r (2) ≤ 0.81). There was no general correlation between the aPTT-CS and ATIII, FVIII, fibrinogen, thrombocytes, C-reactive protein, or ferritin. Conclusion All included COVID-19 patients on CRRT or ECMO conformed to the definition of heparin resistance. A patient-specific association was found between aPTT and anti-Xa.

Such variability stresses the need for novel biomarkers associated with disease outcome. As SARS-CoV-2 infection causes a kidney proximal tubule dysfunction with urinary loss of uric acid, we hypothesized that low serum levels of uric acid (hypouricemia) may be associated with severity and outcome of COVID-19. METHODS: In a retrospective study using two independent cohorts, we investigated and validated the prevalence, kinetics and clinical correlates of hypouricemia among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 to a large academic hospital in Brussels, Belgium. Survival analyses using Cox regression and a competing risk approach assessed the time to mechanical ventilation and/or death. Confocal microscopy assessed the expression of urate transporter URAT1 in kidney proximal tubule cells from patients who died from COVID-19. RESULTS: The discovery and validation cohorts included 192 and 325 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, respectively. Out of the 517 patients, 274 (53%) had severe and 92 (18%) critical COVID-19. In both cohorts, the prevalence of hypouricemia increased from 6% upon admission to 20% within the first days of hospitalization for COVID-19, contrasting with a very rare occurrence (< 1%) before hospitalization for COVID-19. During a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 148 days (50–168), 61 (12%) patients required mechanical ventilation and 93 (18%) died. In both cohorts considered separately and in pooled analyses, low serum levels of uric acid were strongly associated with disease severity (linear trend, P < 0.001) and with progression to death and respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation in Cox (adjusted hazard ratio 5.3, 95% confidence interval 3.6–7.8, P < 0.001) or competing risks (adjusted hazard ratio 20.8, 95% confidence interval 10.4–41.4, P < 0.001) models. At the structural level, kidneys from patients with COVID-19 showed a major reduction in urate transporter URAT1 expression in the brush border of proximal tubules. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with COVID-19 requiring hospitalization, low serum levels of uric acid are common and associate with disease severity and with progression to respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.

Although numerous strategies, including education, quarantine, and immunization, have been used to control COVID-19, the best method to curb this disease is vaccination. Due to the high demand for COVID 19 vaccine, developing countries must carefully identify and prioritize vulnerable populations and rationalize the vaccine allocation process. This study presents a mixed-integer linear programming model for equitable COVID-19 vaccine distribution in developing countries. Vaccines are grouped into cold, very cold, and ultra-cold categories where specific refrigeration is required for their storage and distribution. The possibility of storage for future periods, facing a shortage, budgetary considerations, manufacturer selection, order allocation, time-dependent capacities, and grouping of the heterogeneous population are among the practical assumptions in the proposed approach. Real-world data is used to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the mathematical programming approach proposed in this study.","Tavana, Madjid; Govindan, Kannan; Nasr, Arash Khalili; Heidary, Mohammad Saeed; Mina, Hassan",Ann Oper Res,368,16

The use of selenium as a tool in organic synthesis and as a pharmacological agent goes back to the middle of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth centuries. The rediscovery of ebselen and its investigation in clinical trials have motivated the search for new organoselenium molecules with pharmacological properties. Although ebselen and diselenides have some overlapping pharmacological properties, their molecular targets are not identical. However, they have similar anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, possibly, via activation of transcription factors, regulating the expression of antioxidant genes. In short, our knowledge about the pharmacological properties of simple organoselenium compounds is still elusive. However, contrary to our early expectations that they could imitate selenoproteins, organoselenium compounds seem to have non-specific modulatory activation of antioxidant pathways and specific inhibitory effects in some thiol-containing proteins. The thiol-oxidizing properties of organoselenium compounds are considered the molecular basis of their chronic toxicity; however, the acute use of organoselenium compounds as inhibitors of specific thiol-containing enzymes can be of therapeutic significance. In summary, the outcomes of the clinical trials of ebselen as a mimetic of lithium or as an inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 proteases will be important to the field of organoselenium synthesis. The development of computational techniques that could predict rational modifications in the structure of organoselenium compounds to increase their specificity is required to construct a library of thiol-modifying agents with selectivity toward specific target proteins.","Nogueira, Cristina W.; Barbosa, Nilda V.; Rocha, João B.

One of such plant materials that have been consumed to remedy the severity of this viral infection is the oil of Nigella sativa seed commonly called black seed oil. In this study, we extracted and characterized the oil from this seed using gas chromatography coupled to a mass selective detector to identify the component phytochemicals. Site-directed multiligand docking of the identified compounds was performed on SARS-CoV-2 molecular targets- Replicase polyprotein 1a, RNA binding protein of NSP9, ADP ribose phosphatase of NSP3, 3-chymotrypsin-like protease 3CLpro, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase RDRP, and ACE2–angiotensin-converting enzyme from the Homo sapiens. RESULTS: The binding affinity of caryophyllene oxide was the highest on 3CLpro (− 6.0 kcal/mol), NSP3 (− 6.3 kcal/mol), NSP9 (− 6.3 kcal/mol), and RDRP (− 6.9 kcal/mol) targets, while α-bergamotene gave the best binding affinity on RPIA (5.7 kcal/mol) target. The binding affinity of β-bisabolene on the ACE2 target (− 8.0 kcal/mol) was almost the same as Remdesivir (− 8.1 kcal/mol). The ADMET properties of these three phytochemicals showed that they are good drug leads for these SARS-CoV-2 receptors. CONCLUSION: The findings from this study strongly indicate that the reported recovery from COVID-19 infection claimed by patients who consumed black seed oil could be linked to the presence of caryophyllene oxide, α-bergamotene, and β-bisabolene in this natural product.","Duru, Chidi Edbert; Duru, Ijeoma Akunna; Adegboyega, Abayomi Emmanuel",Bull Natl Res Cent,368,32

In this study five groups of masks were investigated that are of particular relevance to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: re-usable, fabric two-layer and multi-layer masks, disposable procedure/surgical masks, KN95 and N95 filtering facepiece respirators. Experimental work focussed on the particle penetration through mask materials as a function of particle diameter, and the total inward leakage protection performance of the mask system. Geometric mean fabric protection factors varied from 1.78 to 144.5 for the fabric two-layer and KN95 materials, corresponding to overall filtration efficiencies of 43.8% and 99.3% using a flow rate of 17 L/min, equivalent to a breathing expiration rate for a person in a sedentary or standing position conversing with another individual. Geometric mean total inward leakage protection factors for the 2-layer, multi-layer and procedure masks were <2.3, while 6.2 was achieved for the KN95 masks. The highest values were measured for the N95 group at 165.7. Mask performance is dominated by face seal leakage. Despite the additional filtering layers added to cloth masks, and the higher filtration efficiency of the materials used in disposable procedure and KN95 masks, the total inward leakage protection factor was only marginally improved. N95 FFRs were the only mask group investigated that provided not only high filtration efficiency but high total inward leakage protection, and remain the best option to protect individuals from exposure to aerosol in high risk settings. The Mask Quality Factor and total inward leakage performance are very useful to determine the best options for masking. However, it is highly recommended that testing is undertaken on prospective products, or guidance is sought from impartial authorities, to confirm they meet any implied standards.","Duncan, Scott; Bodurtha, Paul; Naqvi, Syed",PLoS One,368,0

However, of the accounts examining the 1918 influenza pandemic and COVID-19, only a notable few discuss race. Yet, a rich, broader scholarship on race and epidemic disease as a “sampling device for social analysis” exists. This commentary examines the historical arc of the 1918 influenza pandemic, focusing on black Americans and showing the complex and sometimes surprising ways it operated, triggering particular responses both within a minority community and in wider racial, sociopolitical, and public health structures. This analysis reveals that critical structural inequities and health care gaps have historically contributed to and continue to compound disparate health outcomes among communities of color.

To determine the localization of virus-specific RNA, serial sections of brains from infected and uninfected mice were annealed with a 35S-labeled antisense RNA probe and analyzed by film autoradiography. In the mice with acute encephalomyelitis, viral RNA was present in the mesencephalon, hypothalamus, hippocampus, basal ganglia, subcortical white matter, and thalamus. Viral RNA was detected in the spinal cords of all mice with the late onset, demyelinating encephalomyelitis, but was distributed into three different patterns in the brains of these mice, even though all had the same clinical disease. In the first group, viral RNA was detected only in the brainstem. In the second group, viral RNA was detected in the brainstem, thalamus, and cerebral grey matter. This distribution was consistent with viral spread along well-defined tracts connecting these parts of the brain. In the third group, viral RNA could be detected both in the brainstem and in several white matter tracts within close physical proximity to the optic chiasm. This distribution was consistent with viral spread by an extracellular route from one white matter tract to other tracts which were physically close, but which were not part of the same pathways. These results suggest that MHV-JHM spreads through the central nervous system both along well-defined neuronal pathways and by spread from contiguous structures, but also suggest that viral replicates preferentially in a limited number of areas of the brain. The technique of in situ hybridization with film autoradiography should be generally useful for analyzing macroscopic movements of virus within infected organs.","Perlman, Stanley; Jacobsen, Gary; Moore, Steven",Virology,368,1

We matched the patients characteristics of cases before COVID-19 to four other patients (controls) with the similar diagnosis, age, gender and comorbidities, known 3-months outcomes which were treated previously at the clinic and no history of COVID 19 disease. Results: All patients who had COVID-19 disease (cases) were required to increase antithrombotic medications, statins, antihypertensive drugs, glucose-lowering medications if diabetes соmpare to before-COVID-19 period compare to 24/248 controls.

This picture contrasts with the discrete representation of n and t underlying the real epidemiological data reported in terms daily numbers of infection cases, for which a description based on finite difference equations would be more adequate. Adopting a logistic growth framework, in this paper we present a quantitative analysis of the errors introduced by the continuous time description. This analysis reveals that, although the height of the epidemiological curve maximum is essentially unaffected, the position Tc1/2 obtained within the continuous time representation is systematically shifted backwards in time with respect to the position Td1/2 predicted within the discrete time representation. Rather counterintuitively, the magnitude of this temporal shift {tau} {equiv} Tc1/2 - Td1/2 < 0 is basically insensitive to changes in infection rate {kappa}.

Findings have consistently identified an increased severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection in individuals with diabetes. Osteopontin, a cytokine-like matrix-associated phosphoglycoprotein, is elevated in diabetes and drives the expression of furin, a proprotein convertase implicated in the proteolytic processing and activation of several precursors, including chemokines, growth factors, hormones, adhesion molecules, and receptors. Elevated serum furin is a signature of diabetes mellitus progression and is associated with a dysmetabolic phenotype and increased risk of diabetes-linked premature mortality. Additionally, furin plays an important role in enhancing the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 by promoting its entry and replication in the host cell. Here, we hypothesize that diabetes-induced osteopontin and furin protein upregulation results in worse outcomes in diabetic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection owing to the roles of these protein in promoting viral infection and increasing metabolic dysfunction. Thus, targeting the osteopontin-furin axis may be a plausible strategy for reducing mortality in SARS-CoV-2 patients with diabetes.","Adu-Agyeiwaah, Yvonne; Grant, Maria B.; Obukhov, Alexander G.",Cells,368,26

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients with maxillofacial fracture visiting during the lockdown period (Phase) were compared to the patient’s record during the same time period in the year 2019 (Control). They were subcategorised based on the etiology of trauma, i.e., road traffic accident (RTA), self-fall, physical assault and animal attacks. Age and gender variations were also assessed. Degree of significance was calculated using t test and p value obtained. RESULT: Mean age of trauma patients during lockdown and control period was 32.66 and 27.93 years, respectively. Number of cases of overall trauma had significantly decreased. Cases of RTA and self-fall were 22 and 4 in lockdown compared to 135 and 16 during control phase.

RESULTS: The results demonstrated that N30 inhibited the replication of H1N1, H3N2, influenza B viruses, including oseltamivir and amantadine resistant strains in vitro. Mechanistically, neuraminidase inhibition assay and hemagglutination inhibition assay suggested that N30 did not directly target the two envelope glycoproteins required for viral adsorption or release. Instead, the compound could depress the activity of IMPDH type II. Based on these findings, we further confirmed that N30 provided a strong inhibition on the replication of respiratory syncytial virus, coronavirus, enterovirus 71 and a diverse strains of coxsackie B virus.

In this respect, it is crucial to determine the case‐increase, case‐fatality, and case‐recovery rates to control COVID‐19. In this study, the case‐increase, case‐fatality, and case‐recovery rates of COVID‐19 in 36 European countries were analyzed with the meta‐analysis method using data released by the health organizations and WHO. The data were obtained from the website of health organizations of 36 European countries and the website of WHO until 11 May 2020. The analyses were carried out on 1 744 704 COVID‐19‐diagnosed cases in 36 European countries. The case‐increase, case‐fatality and case‐recovery rates of COVID‐19 were calculated using 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), single‐arm meta‐analysis, cross‐temporal meta‐analysis, and meta‐regression random‐effects model. The standardized case‐increase rate of COVID‐19 is 5% (95% CI [0.040, 0.063]) and the average case‐increase rate in European countries has started to decline by around 3% (95% CI [0.047, 0.083]) weekly. The countries with the highest rate of case increase are Belgium, Sweden, Russia, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Although the case‐fatality rate of COVID‐19 patients was 4.5% as of May 11 (95% CI [0.037‐0.055]), this rate is 6.3% (95% CI [0.047, 0.083]) in standardized time (6th week). The case‐recovery rates of patients are 46% (95% CI [0.376‐0.547]). This study presents important results regarding the COVID‐19 pandemic in Europe. Although the rate of increase in new COVID‐19 cases has dropped, there is not much decline in the case‐fatality rates and no increase in case‐recovery rates. The case‐fatality rate of COVID‐19 in Europe was estimated to be in the range of 4% to 4.5% and a minimum of 4 weeks (as of 11 May) is expected to have the figure below 1% in a country with an average case‐increase rate. Monitoring case fatalities in Belgium, the Netherlands and Sweden, and treatment successes in Germany and Austria play a role of utmost importance.","Karadag, Engin",J Med Virol,368,10

Authors' response,19.178095,9.650411,2021-08-18,"OBJECTIVE: To explore ABO blood group distribution and clinical characteristics in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: The clinical data of 187 patients with COVID-19 seen between January 20, 2020 and March 5, 2020 at the First Hospital of Changsha were retrospectively analyzed. The differences in the ABO blood group distribution between COVID-19 patients and the control group (1991 cases) were analyzed. The relationship between blood type and clinical characteristics was analyzed. RESULTS: Of the 187 patients with COVID-19, 69 had type A (36.90%), 63 had type B (33.69%), 41 had type O (21.92%), and 14 had type AB blood (7.49%). The proportion of patients with type A blood in the COVID-19 group was significantly higher than that in the control group (36.90% vs. 27.47%, P = 0.006), while the proportion of patients with type O blood in the COVID-19 group was significantly lower than that in the control group (21.92% vs. 30.19%, P = 0.018). The risk of COVID-19 was higher for individuals with blood group A than for those with blood group O (OR = 1.849, 95% CI = 1.228–2.768, P = 0.003). The risk of COVID-19 was higher for patients with blood group A than for those with a blood group other than A (OR = 1.544, 95% CI = 1.122–2.104, P = 0.006). Patients with blood group O had a lower risk of COVID-19 than non-O blood group patients (OR = 0.649, 95% CI = 0.457–0.927, P = 0.018). The ABO blood group distribution was related to COVID-19 status. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with blood group A had an increased risk for infection with SARS-CoV-2, whereas blood group O was associated with a decreased risk, indicating that certain ABO blood groups were correlated with SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility.

Social media has unique and partially untapped potential to supplement formal medical education. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this review is to provide a summary of the incentives, applications, challenges, and pitfalls of social media–based medical education for both trainees and educators. METHODS: We performed a literature review via PubMed of medical research involving social media platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp, and podcasts. Papers were reviewed for inclusion based on the integrity and power of the study. RESULTS: The unique characteristics of social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, WhatsApp, and podcasts endow them with unique communication capabilities that serve different educational purposes in both formal and informal education settings. However, contemporary medical education curricula lack widespread guidance on meaningful use, application, and deployment of social media in medical education. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians and institutions must evolve to embrace the use of social media platforms for medical education. Health care professionals can approach social media engagement in the same ethical manner that they would with patients in person; however, health care institutions ultimately must enable their health care professionals to achieve this by enacting realistic social media policies. Institutions should appoint clinicians with strong social media experience to leadership roles to spearhead these generational and cultural changes. Further studies are needed to better understand how health care professionals can most effectively use social media platforms as educational tools. Ultimately, social media is here to stay, influencing lay public knowledge and trainee knowledge. Clinicians and institutions must embrace this complementary modality of trainee education and champion social media as a novel distribution platform that can also help propagate truth in a time of misinformation, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.","Katz, Marc; Nandi, Neilanjan",JMIR Med Educ,368,16

While previous studies suggest social media usage increases the risk of developing anxiety symptoms, how induced anxiety affects attitudes and behaviors is less discussed, let alone during a global pandemic. Little is known about the relationship between older adults using social media during a pandemic and their anxiety, their attitudes toward social trust in information, and behaviors to avoid contracting COVID-19. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate the associations between using social media for COVID-19-related information and anxiety symptoms as well as the mediation effect of anxiety symptoms on social trust in information and COVID-safe behaviors among older adults. METHODS: A cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted in Hong Kong between May and August 2020. A rapid warm-call protocol was developed to train social workers and volunteers from participant nongovernmental organizations to conduct the telephone surveys. Questions related to COVID-safe behaviors, social trust in information, social media use, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and sociodemographic information were asked. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at the community level was used to account for the risk of contracting COVID-19. Ordinary least squares regressions examined the associations between social media use and anxiety symptoms, and how they were associated with social trust in information and COVID-safe behaviors. Structural equation modeling further mapped out these relationships to identify the mediation effects of anxiety symptoms. RESULTS: This study collected information regarding 3421 adults aged 60 years and older. Use of social media for COVID-19-related information was associated with more anxiety symptoms and lower social trust in information but had no significant relationship with COVID-safe behaviors. Anxiety symptoms predicted lower social trust in information and higher COVID-safe behaviors. Lower social trust in information was predicted by using social media for COVID-19 information, mediated by anxiety symptoms, while no mediation effect was found for COVID-safe behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Older adults who rely on social media for COVID-19-related information exhibited more anxiety symptoms, while showing mixed effects on attitudes and behaviors. Social trust in information may be challenged by unverified and contradictory information online. The negligible impact on COVID-safe behaviors suggested that social media may have caused more confusion than consolidating a consistent effort against the pandemic. Media literacy education is recommended to promote critical evaluation of COVID-19-related information and responsible sharing among older adults.","Wong, Frankie Ho Chun; Liu, Tianyin; Leung, Dara Kiu Yi; Zhang, Anna Y; Au, Walker Siu Hong; Kwok, Wai Wai; Shum, Angie K Y; Wong, Gloria Hoi Yan; Lum, Terry Yat-Sang",J Med Internet Res,368,16

This article presents incidence and mortality estimates for 25 major cancers across 40 individual countries within European areas and the European Union (EU-27) for the year 2020. METHODS: The estimated national incidence and mortality rates are based on statistical methodology previously applied and verified using the most recently collected incidence data from 151 population-based cancer registries, mortality data and 2020 population estimates. RESULTS: Estimates reveal 4 million new cases of cancer (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) and 1.9 million cancer-related deaths. The most common cancers are: breast in women (530,000 cases), colorectum (520,000), lung (480,000) and prostate (470,000). These four cancers account for half the overall cancer burden in Europe. The most common causes of cancer deaths are: lung (380,000), colorectal (250,000), breast (140,000) and pancreatic (130,000) cancers. In EU-27, the estimated new cancer cases are approximately 1.4 million in males and 1.2 million in females, with over 710,000 estimated cancer deaths in males and 560,000 in females. CONCLUSION: The 2020 estimates provide a basis for establishing priorities in cancer-control measures across Europe. The long-established role of cancer registries in cancer surveillance and the evaluation of cancer control measures remain fundamental in formulating and adapting national cancer plans and pan-European health policies. Given the estimates are built on recorded data prior to the onset of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), they do not take into account the impact of the pandemic.","Dyba, Tadeusz; Randi, Giorgia; Bray, Freddie; Martos, Carmen; Giusti, Francesco; Nicholson, Nicholas; Gavin, Anna; Flego, Manuela; Neamtiu, Luciana; Dimitrova, Nadya; Negrão Carvalho, Raquel; Ferlay, Jacques; Bettio, Manola",Eur J Cancer,368,16

One way to stop spreading over the airline network are travel restrictions for major airports or network hubs based on the total number of passengers of an airport. Here, we test alternative strategies using edge removal, cancelling targeted flight connections rather than restricting traffic for network hubs, for controlling spreading over the airline network. We employ a SEIR metapopulation model that takes into account the population of cities, simulates infection within cities and across the network of the top 500 airports, and tests different flight cancellation methods for limiting the course of infection. The time required to spread an infection globally, as simulated by a stochastic global spreading model was used to rank the candidate control strategies. The model includes both local spreading dynamics at the level of populations and long-range connectivity obtained from real global airline travel data. Simulated spreading in this network showed that spreading infected 37% less individuals after cancelling a quarter of flight connections between cities, as selected by betweenness centrality. The alternative strategy of closing down whole airports causing the same number of cancelled connections only reduced infections by 18%. In conclusion, selecting highly ranked single connections between cities for cancellation was more effective, resulting in fewer individuals infected with influenza, compared to shutting down whole airports. It is also a more efficient strategy, affecting fewer passengers while producing the same reduction in infections. The network of connections between the top 500 airports is available under the resources link on our website http://www.biological-networks.org.","Marcelino, Jose; Kaiser, Marcus",PLoS Curr,368,1

The COVID-19 is not only a simple viral infection of the bronchial system but is also a pandemic hyperinflammatory multiorgan disease. The cardiovascular system plays a causal role in this context, as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) invades host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2), an enzyme in the renin-angiotensin system. Furthermore, cardiovascular comorbidities and risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes and obesity play an important role in the severity of the course of the disease. Additional risk factors, such as gender, age, genetics and air pollution modulate both the severity of the SARS-CoV‑2 infection as well as cardiovascular diseases. As sequelae of COVID-19, increased thrombosis, myocardial infarction, myocardial inflammation and vasculitis occur, which directly damage the cardiovascular system and substantially contribute to the high morbidity and mortality. Knowledge gained from many studies on the course of the disease in patients infected with SARS-CoV‑2 has led to improved treatment possibilities, which now in the second wave are partly standardized and were, and are, in particular adapted to complications of the cardiovascular system.

Mie scattering and laser induced incandescence (LII) were respectively employed to measure the sooting limits and soot volume fraction, both of which were used as quantitative sooting tendency indices of the flames. Research foci were paid to analyze the impacts of fuel molecular structure on sooting tendencies, ranging from the length of the carbon chain, fuel unsaturation, presence and position of the branched chain as well as the cyclic ring structure. It was found that the present CDF-based sooting tendency data did not always agree with existing literature results that were obtained from either coflow or premixed flame experiments, indicating the importance of considering flame conditions when assessing fuel sooting tendencies. Several interesting observations were made; in particular, our results showed that the sooting limits of C5-C8 n-alkane is comparable, regardless of the carbon-chain length, indicating an interesting fuel similarity pertinent to sooting tendency. In addition, we found that cyclopentane, with a five-membered ring, has even stronger sooting propensity than the six-membered cyclohexane; this trend occurs because cyclopentane prefers to decompose to more odd-carbon radicals of cyclopentadienyl and allyl, which are efficient aromatic precursors.

The number of reported infected people and its consequent death toll herald relative inadequacies in the quality and extent of the measures in curbing the COVID‐19 transmission cycle. This study was conducted to investigate knowledge, attitude, precautionary practices and degree of fear related to COVID‐19 in a sample of Iranian population. This study was conducted among 457 residents of Kurdistan Province, Iran, through social networks and social media (WhatsApp and Telegram). Knowledge, attitude and practice and fear of COVID‐19 were collected using valid tools. Multiple logistic regression and multivariate linear regression analyses were used to identify factors associated with binary outcome attitudes, practices and continuous variables knowledge and fear of COVID‐19, respectively. The mean (SD) age of participants was 37.86 (10.42); of them, 252 (55.1%) were men, and more than two‐thirds were married (74.8%). About 10% of the respondents were in believed that COVID‐19 could create a type of social stigma. Level of knowledge about COVID‐19 in 77.8% of the study attendees was acceptable, and 352 of them (70%) were confident that the virus would eventually be successfully controlled in the world, but only 252 of the attendants (50%) had confidence about successful control of COVID‐19 in Iran. Applying multiple logistic regression, knowledge (OR: 1.18, p = 0.028) and fear (OR: 1.04, p = 0.028) of COVID‐19 were associated with positive attitude towards controllability of COVID‐19.

Global change refers to environmental changes arising from human activities affecting the fundamental mechanisms operating in the biosphere. This paper discusses the changes observed in recent times with regard to some important arboviral (arthropod-borne viral) diseases of animals, and the role global change could have played in these variations. Two of the most important arboviral diseases of animals, bluetongue (BT) and West Nile fever/encephalitis (WNF), have been selected as models. In both cases, in the last 15 years an important leap forward has been observed, which has lead to considering them emerging diseases in different parts of the world. BT, affecting domestic ruminants, has recently afflicted livestock in Europe in an unprecedented epizootic, causing enormous economic losses. WNF affects wildlife (birds), domestic animals (equines), and humans, thus, beyond the economic consequences of its occurrence, as a zoonotic disease, it poses an important public health threat. West Nile virus (WNV) has expanded in the last 12 years worldwide, and particularly in the Americas, where it first occurred in 1999, extending throughout the Americas relentlessly since then, causing a severe epidemic of disastrous consequences for public health, wildlife, and livestock. In Europe, WNV is known long time ago, but it is since the last years of the twentieth century that its incidence has risen substantially. Circumstances such as global warming, changes in land use and water management, increase in travel, trade of animals, and others, can have an important influence in the observed changes in both diseases. The following question is raised: What is the contribution of global changes to the current increase of these diseases in the world?","Jiménez-Clavero, Miguel Á",Front Genet,368,1

We estimate that households lost a substantial share of their net income of 6.9% on average. But policies protected household incomes to a substantial degree: compared to the drop in net income, GDP per capita fell by 18.9% between the first and second quarter of 2020. Earnings subsidies (the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme) protected household finances and provided the main insurance mechanism during the crisis. Besides subsidies, Covid-related increases to state benefits, as well as the automatic stabilisers in the tax and benefit system, played an important role in mitigating the income losses. However, analysing the impact of a near-decade of austerity on the UK safety net, we find that, compared to 2011 policies, the 2020 pre-Covid tax-benefit policies would have been less effective in insuring incomes against the shocks. We also assess the potential distributional impact of introducing a Universal Basic Income (UBI) instead of the Covid emergency measures and find that a UBI would have supported the incomes of different vulnerable groups but would have provided less protection to those hit hardest by the labour market shocks.

This technique is known as electroosmotic flow (EOF). The problem of the Caputo–Fabrizio time-fractional derivative of the electroosmotic generalized Burgers’ fluid through a vertical annulus with free convection heat transfer has been investigated. The annulus walls kept at constant values of a zeta potential. The dimensionless governing equations have been solved with the help of the Laplace and finite Hankel transforms. The inversion of Laplace for the transformed functions is calculated numerically. The essential features of the electroosmotic flow (EOF) and the related thermal characteristics are clearly illustrated by the variations in the velocity, the flow rate, the temperature and the Nusselt number. Moreover, comparisons with other non-Newtonian fluids have been discussed. It was found that the presence of the electric double layer (EDL) accelerates the fluid near the walls of the annulus, while in the core region, the reverse flow is noticed.","Abd Elmaboud, Y.",,368,15

The aim of this study was to describe the etiology, clinical characteristics, and outcomes of adult SHLH. Fifty‐four adult patients who fulfilled the criteria of SHLH were enrolled in the study. Viral etiology, blood biomarkers, and clinical manifestations of SHLH were analyzed in these patients. Twenty‐four SHLH patients had viraemia, whereas 30 SHLH patients were secondary to other diseases. Epstein‐Barr virus (EBV) was the most common virus that associated SHLH among all viruses studied. Severe SHLH patients with EBV‐viraemia presented significantly high levels of ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase, aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase (ALT). Positively relationships existed between EBV DNA titers and levels of AST and ALT (P < 0.05). The prognosis of SHLH patients with EBV viraemia was worse than that of non‐EBV SHLH and non‐viral SHLH.

While the expression of ACE2 in healthy human tissues has been well characterized, it is not known which diseases and drugs might modulate the ACE2 expression. In this study, we developed GENEVA (GENe Expression Variance Analysis), a semi-automated framework for exploring massive amounts of RNA-seq datasets. We applied GENEVA to 28,6650 publicly available RNA-seq samples to identify any previously studied experimental conditions that could directly or indirectly modulate ACE2 expression. We identified multiple drugs, genetic perturbations, and diseases that modulate the expression of ACE2, including cardiomyopathy, HNF1A overexpression, and drug treatments with RAD140 and Itraconazole. Our unbiased meta-analysis of seven datasets confirms ACE2 up-regulation in all cardiomyopathy categories. Using electronic health records data from 3936 COVID19 patients, we demonstrate that patients with pre-existing cardiomyopathy have an increased mortality risk than age-matched patients with other cardiovascular conditions.

For these viruses, receptor binding and entry are accomplished by a single viral envelope protein (termed the fusion protein), the structural changes of which trigger the remodeling and merger of the viral and target cellular membranes. The number of fusion proteins required for fusion activity is still under debate, and several studies report this value to range from 1 to 9 for type I fusion proteins. Here, we consider the earliest stage of viral fusion based on the continuum theory of membrane elasticity. We demonstrate that membrane deformations induced by the oblique insertion of amphipathic fusion peptides mediate the lateral interaction of these peptides and drive them to form into a symmetric fusion rosette. The pulling force produced by the structural rearrangements of the fusion protein ectodomains gives additional torque, which deforms the membrane and additionally stabilizes the symmetric fusion rosette, thus allowing a reduction in the number of fusion peptides needed for fusion. These findings can resolve the large range of published cooperativity indices for HIV, influenza, and other type I fusion proteins.","Akimov, Sergey A.; Kondrashov, Oleg V.; Zimmerberg, Joshua; Batishchev, Oleg V.",Int J Mol Sci,368,1

We simulated: 1) individual and cumulative SARS-CoV-2 infection risks from close contact (droplet and aerosols at 1–3m), aerosol, and fomite-mediated exposures to a susceptible worker following exposure to an infected worker during an 8h-shift; and 2) the relative reduction in SARS-CoV-2 infection risk attributed to infection control interventions (physical distancing, mask use, ventilation, surface disinfection, hand hygiene). Without mitigation measures, the SARS-CoV-2 infection risk was largest for close contact (droplet and aerosol) at 1m (0.96, 95%CI: 0.67–1.0). In comparison, risk associated with fomite (0.26, 95%CI: 0.10–0.56) or aerosol exposure alone (0.05, 95%CI: 0.01–0.13) at 1m distance was substantially lower (73–95%).

Periodontal pathogenic bacteria like Porphyromonas gingivalis, that belongs to the complex net of oral microflora, exhibits a toxicogenic potential by releasing endotoxins, which are the lipopolysaccharide component (LPS) available in the outer cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria. Endotoxins are released into the tissues causing damage after the cell is lysed. There are three well-defined regions in the LPS: one of them, the lipid A, has a lipidic nature, and the other two, the Core and the O-antigen, have a glycosidic nature, all of them with independent and synergistic functions. Lipid A is the “bioactive center” of LPS, responsible for its toxicity, and shows great variability along bacteria. In general, endotoxins have specific receptors at the cells, causing a wide immunoinflammatory response by inducing the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the production of matrix metalloproteinases. This response is not coordinated, favoring the dissemination of LPS through blood vessels, as well as binding mainly to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expressed in the host cells, leading to the destruction of the tissues and the detrimental effect in some systemic pathologies. Lipid A can also act as a TLRs antagonist eliciting immune deregulation. Although bacterial endotoxins have been extensively studied clinically and in a laboratory, their effects on the oral cavity and particularly on periodontium deserve special attention since they affect the connective tissue that supports the tooth, and can be linked to advanced medical conditions. This review addresses the distribution of endotoxins associated with periodontal pathogenic bacteria and its relationship with systemic diseases, as well as the effect of some therapeutic alternatives.","Marcano, Rosalia; Rojo, M.

The present study investigated depression and anxiety and their correlates among individuals with medical conditions in Bangladesh. METHODS: Subjects were recruited to participate in an internet-based survey. Data were collected from November 2020 to January 2021 using convenience sampling by a semi-structured questionnaire through online platforms. Multiple regression analyses were performed to determine associations applying Bonferroni correction (p < 0.004). The Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) measured depression and anxiety, respectively. RESULTS: Nine-hundred-and-seventy-one participants (50.1% male; mean age = 42.29 ± 15.86 years; age range = 18-80 years) with medical conditions were included in final analyses. The most frequently reported conditions were diabetes, hypertension, obesity, heart disease, asthma, and anemia. Estimates of moderate to severe depression and anxiety were 38.9% and 35.2%, respectively. The mean depression and anxiety scores were significantly higher among participants who reported having hypertension, obesity, heart disease, asthma, anemia, cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Using Bonferroni correction (p < 0.004), depression was associated with being female and a student, having poorer quality of life, poorer health status and greater numbers of co-morbidities, not engaging in physical exercise and tobacco smoking. Anxiety was associated with being female and a student, having lower socioeconomic status, poorer quality of life, poorer health status and greater numbers of co-morbidities, less sleep and tobacco smoking. CONCLUSIONS: Depression and anxiety are prevalent among individuals with medical conditions and correlate with sociodemographic, quality-of-life and smoking measures. Interventions targeting vulnerable groups should be employed and investigated.","Tasnim, Rafia; Sujan, Md. Safaet Hossain; Islam, Md. Saiful; Ferdous, Most.

The majority of planned surgery was cancelled or postponed in March 2020 for the duration of the first wave of the pandemic. We investigated the experiences of staff responsible for delivering rapid changes to surgical services during the first wave of the pandemic in the UK, with the aim of developing lessons for future major systems change. Methods Using a rapid qualitative study design, we conducted 25 interviews with frontline surgical staff during the first wave of the pandemic. We also carried out a policy review of the guidance developed for those delivering surgical services in pandemic conditions. We used framework analysis to organise and interpret findings. Results Staff discussed positive and negative experiences of rapid service organisation. Clinician-led decision making, the flexibility of individual staff and teams, and the opportunity to innovate service design were all seen as positive contributors to success in service adaptation. The negative aspects of rapid change were inconsistent guidance from national government and medical bodies, top-down decisions about when to cancel and restart surgery, the challenges of delivering emergency surgical care safely and the complexity of prioritising surgical cases when services re-started. Conclusion Success in the rapid reorganisation of elective surgical services can be attributed to the flexibility and adaptability of staff. However, there was an absence of involvement of staff in wider system-level pandemic decision-making and competing guidance from national bodies. Involving staff in decisions about the organisation and delivery of major systems change is essential for the sustainability of change processes.","Singleton, G.; Dowrick, A.; Manby, L.; Fillmore, H.; Syversen, A.; Lewis-Jackson, S.; Uddin, I.; Sumray, K.; Bautista, E.; Johnson, G.; Vindrola-Padros, C.",,368,1

This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcomes including mortality and viral shedding period in COVID-19 patients with cancer in Japan. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 32 patients with a history of cancer who were referred to our hospital between January 31, 2020 and May 25, 2020. We evaluated the association between clinical outcomes and potential prognostic factors using univariate analyses. RESULTS: The median age was 74.5 (range 24–90) years and 22 patients (69%) were men. A total of 11 patients (34%) died. Our analyses demonstrated that the mortality was significantly associated with lymphocyte count, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, serum ferritin, and C-reactive protein on admission. The median period between illness onset and the first effective negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR result was 22 days (interquartile range 18–25) in survivors. Of four patients with hematological malignancy who developed COVID-19 within the rest period of chemotherapy, three died and the other patient, who received bendamustine plus rituximab therapy, had the longest duration of viral shedding (56 days). CONCLUSION: Our study suggested that the risk factors for mortality previously reported in general COVID-19 patients, including lymphocytopenia, were also effective in cancer patients. Patients who received cytotoxic chemotherapy recently or were treated with chemotherapy, which can lead to lymphocyte reduction, had poor prognosis and prolonged periods of viral shedding.

SARS‐CoV‐2 is novel and the effect on typically prevalent seasonal viruses is just becoming apparent. We present our initial data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the month of March 2020. This is a retrospective cohort study post launching of SARS‐CoV‐2 testing at Baylor Scott and White Hospital (BSWH), Temple, Texas. Testing for SARS‐CoV‐2 was performed by real‐time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay and results were shared with State public health officials for immediate interventions. More than 3500 tests were performed during the first 2 weeks of testing for SARS‐CoV‐2 and identified 168 (4.7%) positive patients. Sixty‐two (3.2%) of the 1912 ambulatory patients and 106 (6.3%) of the 1659 emergency department/inpatients tested were positive. The highest rate of infection (6.9%) was seen in patients aged 25 to 34 years, while the lowest rate of infection was seen among patients aged <25 years old (2%). County‐specific patient demographic information was shared with respective public health departments for epidemiological interventions. Incidentally, this study showed that there was a significant decrease in the occurrence of seasonal respiratory virus infections, perhaps due to increased epidemiological awareness about SARS‐CoV‐2 among the general public, as well as the social distancing measures implemented in response to SARS‐CoV‐2. Data extracted for BSWH from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System site revealed that Influenza incidence was 8.7% in March 2020, compared with 25% in March 2019. This study was intended to provide an initial experience of dealing with a pandemic and the role of laboratories in crisis management.

Description Nous rapportons quatre cas de patients ayant présenté une aggravation de leur insuffisance rénale chronique (IRC) dans les suites d’une infection COVID-19. Méthodes Entre novembre 2020 et avril 2021, quatre patients d’origine Africaine âgés de 47 à 74 ans, suivis dans notre service, ont été hospitalisés pour une aggravation de leur IRC. Leur néphropathie sous-jacente était une néphroangiosclérose (n =2), un diabète (n =1), une HSF collapsante (n =1) prouvée par ponction biopsie rénale (PBR). Lors du suivi, leur clairance était en moyenne de 47mL/min/1,73m2 avec une protéinurie négative ou<1,6g/g. Résultats Les patients ont été hospitalisés pour une aggravation majeure de leur IRC. À l’admission, la clairance moyenne était de 18mL/min/1,73m2 associée à une protéinurie de rang néphrotique. Une infection COVID-19 a été retrouvée dans les deux mois précédents chez deux des quatre patients. Tous avaient une sérologie COVID-19 positive, ainsi que les allèles à risque du gène ApoL1 (homozygote G1/G1 ou hétérozygote G1/G2). Deux patients ont eu une PBR retrouvant une HSF collapsante. La PBR n’a pas été réalisée chez les autres en raison d’une hypotrophie rénale. Durant le suivi, deux patients sont restés stables, un a nécessité le recours à l’hémodialyse et le dernier a été traité par corticoïdes 0,5mg/kg/j, permettant une diminution de la protéinurie et une amélioration partielle de la fonction rénale. La particularité de notre série est l’existence d’une IRC sous-jacente régulièrement suivie. Il reste à déterminer si la présence d’une IRC constitue un facteur favorisant la survenue d’une COVAN (Tableau 1). Conclusion L’aggravation rapide d’une IRC et d’une protéinurie doit maintenant faire rechercher une antériorité d’infection par la COVID-19. La COVAN est probablement sous-estimée chez ces patients pour lesquels la PBR n’est la plupart du temps pas effectuée.","Housset, P.; Kone, I.; Boudina, R.; Faucon, A.

To this end, many antigen detection devices were developed and commercialized. These devices are mostly based on detecting SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein. Recently, alerts issued by both the FDA and the CDC raised concerns regarding the devices tendency to exhibit false positive results. In this work we developed a novel alternative spike-based antigen assay, comprised of four high-affinity, specific monoclonal antibodies, directed against different epitopes on the spike S1 subunit. The assay performance was evaluated for COVID-19 detection from nasopharyngeal swabs, compared to an in-house nucleocapsid-based assay, composed of antibodies directed against the nucleocapsid. Detection of COVID-19 was carried out in a cohort of 284 qRT-PCR positive and negative nasopharyngeal swab samples. The time resolved fluorescence (TRF) ELISA spike-assay displayed very high specificity (99%) accompanied with a somewhat lower sensitivity (66% for Ct<25), compared to the nucleocapsid ELISA assay which was more sensitive (85% for Ct<25) while less specific (87% specificity). Despite being out-performed by qRT-PCR, we suggest that there is room for such tests in the clinical setting, as cheap and rapid pre-screening tools. Our results further suggest that when applying antigen detection, one must consider its intended application (sensitivity vs specificity), taking into consideration that the nucleocapsid might not be the optimal target. In this regard, we propose that a combination of both antigens might contribute to the validity of the results.","Barlev-Gross, M.; Weiss, S.; Ben-Shmuel, A.; Sittner, A.; Eden, K.; Mazuz, N.; Glinert, I.; Bar-David, E.; Puni, R.; Amit, S.; Kriger, O.; Schuster, O.; Alcalay, R.; Makdasi, E.; Epstein, E.; Noy-Porat, T.; Rosenfeld, R.; Achdout, H.; Mazor, O.; Israely, T.; Levy, H.; Mechaly, A.",,368,8

In our study (N = 783), we examined whether people with higher feelings of anxiety and lack of control early in the COVID‐19 pandemic endorse more conspiracy theories. Our results show that a higher perception of risk of COVID‐19 and lower trust in institutions' response to the pandemic were related to feelings of anxiety and lack of control. Feeling the lack of control, but not anxiety, independently predicted COVID‐19 conspiracy theory endorsement. Importantly, COVID‐19 conspiracy beliefs were strongly correlated with generic conspiracy and pseudoscientific beliefs, which were likewise associated with the feeling of lack of control and lower trust in institutions.

In total, 23% (n=105) of the participating women had severe stress while 16.7% (n=76) reported extremely severe stress. Multiparity (2–4) and occupation, such as trading and farming, were predictors of depression whereas grand-multiparity, urban residence, and trading, were identified as predictors of anxiety and stress. CONCLUSION: Symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress were relatively common among pregnant women during the COVID-19 lockdown in Abakaliki, Nigeria. There is a clear need to integrate screening for depression, anxiety and stress, in existing antenatal care programs so as to identify and prevent long-term adverse psychological outcomes related to the COVID-19 pandemic.","Nwafor, Johnbosco Ifunanya; Okedo-Alex, Ijeoma Nkem; Ikeotuonye, Arinze Chidiebele",Malawi Med J,368,20

However, despite our best efforts to mitigate viral transmission, many of our migraine patients may eventually be exposed to SARS‐CoV2. While most patients will have mild to moderate symptoms, a subset will become severely ill, with possible complications including respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Given the possibility of this level of severe respiratory illness, we should consider what effect blocking calcitonin gene‐related peptide (CGRP) might have on these patients.","Robertson, Carrie E.",Headache,368,19

Efforts to develop a protective vaccine against COVID-19 have yielded several vaccine platforms currently in distribution targeting the original SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequence from the first cases of infection. In recent months, variants of SARS-CoV-2 have raised concerns that viral mutation may undermine vaccination efforts through viral escape of host immune memory acquired from infection or vaccination. We therefore used a computational approach to predict changes in spike protein antigenicity with respect to host B cell and CD8+ T cell immunity across six SARS-CoV-2 variants (D614G, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, P.1, B.1.429, and mink-related). Our epitope analysis using DiscoTope suggests possible changes in B cell epitopes in the S1 region of the spike protein across variants, in particular the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 lineages, which may influence immunodominance. Additionally, we show that high-affinity MHC-I-binding peptides and glycosylation sites on the spike protein appear consistent between variants with the exception of an extra glycosylation site in the P.1 variant. Together, these analyses suggests T cell vaccine strategies have the most longevity before reformulation.","Ge, Anni; Rioux, Melissa; Kelvin, Alyson A.",bioRxiv,368,1

During this period, consultations and admissions for acute medical conditions decreased, which was associated with an increase in disease-specific morbidity and mortality. Therefore, we sought to determine what, if any, effect the early COVID-19 pandemic period had on the presentation, management, and histopathologic severity of acute appendicitis. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, observational study to compare the frequencies with which patients presented with acute appendicitis, the proportion of whom were managed surgically, and the distribution of histopathologic disease severity among all resected appendix specimens during the early COVID-19 pandemic period (March 6–June 30, 2020) to equivalent time periods for the 3 preceding/pre-pandemic years (2017–2019). RESULTS: Compared with equivalent pre-pandemic time periods, during the COVID-19 pandemic period there was no significant difference in the number of patients who presented for acute appendicitis, there was a decreased rate of surgical management (81% vs 94%; p=0.014), and there was an overall increase in the incidence of perforated appendicitis (31% vs 16%; p=0.004), including by histopathologic diagnosis (25% vs 11%; p=0.01). DISCUSSION: Despite potential patient hesitancy to present for care, the early COVID-19 pandemic period was associated with no significant change in the number of patients presenting with acute appendicitis; however, there was a significant increase in the incidence of perforated appendicitis. This study highlights the need to encourage patients to avoid late presentation for acute surgical conditions and for the robust planning for the medical management of otherwise surgical abnormalities during episodes of restricted or limited resources.

While a clinical setting allows the estimation of gait speed under controlled conditions that present functional capacity, gait speed in real-life conditions provides the actual performance of the patient. The goal of this study was to investigate objectively under what conditions during daily activities, patients perform as well as or better than in the clinic. To this end, we recruited 27 Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients and measured their gait speed by inertial measurement units through several walking tests in the clinic as well as their daily activities at home. By fitting a bimodal Gaussian model to their gait speed distribution, we found that on average, patients had similar modes in the clinic and during daily activities. Furthermore, we observed that the number of medication doses taken throughout the day had a moderate correlation with the difference between clinic and home. Performing a cycle-by-cycle analysis on gait speed during the home assessment, overall only about 3% of the strides had equal or greater gait speeds than the patients’ capacity in the clinic. These strides were during long walking bouts (>1 min) and happened before noon, around 26 min after medication intake, reaching their maximum occurrence probability 3 h after Levodopa intake. These results open the possibility of better control of medication intake in PD by considering both functional capacity and continuous monitoring of gait speed during real-life conditions.","Atrsaei, Arash; Corrà, Marta Francisca; Dadashi, Farzin; Vila-Chã, Nuno; Maia, Luis; Mariani, Benoit; Maetzler, Walter; Aminian, Kamiar",NPJ Parkinsons Dis,368,1

Therefore, we hypothesized that the predictive performance of COVID-19 mortality scores is now lower than originally reported. We aimed to prospectively evaluate the current predictive accuracy of six COVID-19 scores and compared it with the accuracy of clinical gestalt predictions. 200 patients with COVID-19 were enrolled in a tertiary hospital in Mexico City between September and December 2020. The area under the curve (AUC) of the LOW-HARM, qSOFA, MSL-COVID-19, NUTRI-CoV, and NEWS2 scores and the AUC of clinical gestalt predictions of death (as a percentage) were determined. In total, 166 patients (106 men and 60 women aged 56±9 years) with confirmed COVID-19 were included in the analysis. The AUC of all scores was significantly lower than originally reported: LOW-HARM 0.76 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.84) vs 0.96 (95% CI 0.94 to 0.98), qSOFA 0.61 (95% CI 0.53 to 0.69) vs 0.74 (95% CI 0.65 to 0.81), MSL-COVID-19 0.64 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.73) vs 0.72 (95% CI 0.69 to 0.75), NUTRI-CoV 0.60 (95% CI 0.51 to 0.69) vs 0.79 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.82), NEWS2 0.65 (95% CI 0.56 to 0.75) vs 0.84 (95% CI 0.79 to 0.90), and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio 0.65 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.73) vs 0.74 (95% CI 0.62 to 0.85). Clinical gestalt predictions were non-inferior to mortality scores, with an AUC of 0.68 (95% CI 0.59 to 0.77). Adjusting scores with locally derived likelihood ratios did not improve their performance; however, some scores outperformed clinical gestalt predictions when clinicians’ confidence of prediction was <80%. Despite its subjective nature, clinical gestalt has relevant advantages in predicting COVID-19 clinical outcomes.

Currently, no empirical research has yet been published in China evaluating IRB performance measures by the use of a standardized tool. This study was therefore conducted to develop a Chinese version of the IRB Researcher Assessment Tool (IRB-RAT), assess the psychometric properties of the Chinese version (IRB-RAT-CV), and validate the tool for use in China. METHODS: In this cultural adaptation, cross-sectional validation study, the IRB-RAT-CV was developed through a back-translation process and then distributed to 587 IRB staff members and researchers in medical institutions and schools in Hunan Province that review biomedical and social-behavioral research. Data from the 470 valid questionnaires collected from participants was used to evaluate the reliability, content validity, and construct validity of the IRB-RAT-CV.

The source of the virus for the cats was their COVID‐19‐affected owner, with whom they were in continuous proximity in a small household setting. The owner's signs included fatigue, sneezing, anosmia and loss of taste, and diagnosis was confirmed 4 days after symptom onset. Oropharyngeal and faecal swabs were collected from the cats, to investigate the course of SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA concentrations, as well as the directionality of the chain of virus transmission. Both infected cats were real‐time RT‐PCR‐positive on various time‐points. Pharyngeal shedding of at least 6 days was observed in them, with high SARS‐CoV‐2 titres (> 7 Log(10) copies/swab) on the first sampling time‐point, that is, 7 days after the onset of owner's clinical signs. In one cat, after the initial decline, slightly increasing virus titres were measured 3 to 6 days after the first real‐time RT‐PCR‐positive swab. Serological testing of this cat revealed absence of seroconversion. The course of viral RNA concentrations in the faecal swabs of the other cat was similar to that in its pharynx. The detected SARS‐CoV‐2 strains, from both infected cats and their owner, underwent whole‐genome sequencing, revealing the absence of emergence of cross‐species adaptive mutations in cats. The results support the notion that human SARS‐CoV‐2 strains are relatively well‐adapted to cats. It is still unclear whether asymptomatic animals could play a role in COVID‐19 epidemiology, in case of interaction with naïve animals and/or people. Our findings highlight difficulties in SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission to cats, as neither the two infected cats nor their owner was able to transmit the virus to a third cat living in the same small flat, despite their very close contact during the days corresponding to high virus shedding.","Chaintoutis, Serafeim C.; Siarkou, Victoria I.; Mylonakis, Mathios E.; Kazakos, George M.; Skeva, Panagiota‐Nefeli; Bampali, Maria; Dimitriou, Marios; Dovrolis, Nikolaos; Polizopoulou, Zoe S.; Karakasiliotis, Ioannis; Dovas, Chrysostomos I.",Transbound Emerg Dis,368,20

We undertook a population-based retrospective observational study in Ontario, Canada to assess the impact of the pandemic on organized cancer screening and diagnostic services, and assess whether patterns of cancer screening service use and diagnostic delay differ across population sub-groups during the pandemic. Provincial health databases were used to identify age-eligible individuals who participated in one or more of Ontario's breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancer screening programs from January 1, 2019-December 31, 2020. Ontario's screening programs delivered 951,000 (-41%) fewer screening tests in 2020 than in 2019 and volumes for most programs remained more than 20% below historical levels by the end of 2020. A smaller percentage of cervical screening participants were older (50-59 and 60-69 years) during the pandemic when compared with 2019. Individuals in the oldest age groups and in lower-income neighborhoods were significantly more likely to experience diagnostic delay following an abnormal breast, cervical, or colorectal cancer screening test during the pandemic, and individuals with a high probability of living on a First Nation reserve were significantly more likely to experience diagnostic delay following an abnormal fecal test. Ongoing monitoring and management of backlogs must continue. Further evaluation is required to identify populations for whom access to cancer screening and diagnostic care has been disproportionately impacted and quantify impacts of these service disruptions on cancer incidence, stage, and mortality.

Clinicians frequently rely solely on their own clinical judgement for risk prediction rather than objective measures. We aimed to compare the accuracy of freely available objective surgical risk tools with subjective clinical assessment in predicting 30-day mortality. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a prospective observational study in 274 hospitals in the United Kingdom (UK), Australia, and New Zealand. For 1 week in 2017, prospective risk, surgical, and outcome data were collected on all adults aged 18 years and over undergoing surgery requiring at least a 1-night stay in hospital. Recruitment bias was avoided through an ethical waiver to patient consent; a mixture of rural, urban, district, and university hospitals participated. We compared subjective assessment with 3 previously published, open-access objective risk tools for predicting 30-day mortality: the Portsmouth-Physiology and Operative Severity Score for the enUmeration of Mortality (P-POSSUM), Surgical Risk Scale (SRS), and Surgical Outcome Risk Tool (SORT). We then developed a logistic regression model combining subjective assessment and the best objective tool and compared its performance to each constituent method alone. We included 22,631 patients in the study: 52.8% were female, median age was 62 years (interquartile range [IQR] 46 to 73 years), median postoperative length of stay was 3 days (IQR 1 to 6), and inpatient 30-day mortality was 1.4%. Clinicians used subjective assessment alone in 88.7% of cases. All methods overpredicted risk, but visual inspection of plots showed the SORT to have the best calibration. The SORT demonstrated the best discrimination of the objective tools (SORT Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic curve [AUROC] = 0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.88–0.92; P-POSSUM = 0.89, 95% CI 0.88–0.91; SRS = 0.85, 95% CI 0.82–0.87). Subjective assessment demonstrated good discrimination (AUROC = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.86–0.91) that was not different from the SORT (p = 0.309). Combining subjective assessment and the SORT improved discrimination (bootstrap optimism-corrected AUROC = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.90–0.94) and demonstrated continuous Net Reclassification Improvement (NRI = 0.13, 95% CI: 0.06–0.20, p < 0.001) compared with subjective assessment alone. Decision-curve analysis (DCA) confirmed the superiority of the SORT over other previously published models, and the SORT–clinical judgement model again performed best overall. Our study is limited by the low mortality rate, by the lack of blinding in the ‘subjective’ risk assessments, and because we only compared the performance of clinical risk scores as opposed to other prediction tools such as exercise testing or frailty assessment. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed that the combination of subjective assessment with a parsimonious risk model improved perioperative risk estimation. This may be of value in helping clinicians allocate finite resources such as critical care and to support patient involvement in clinical decision-making.","Wong, Danny J.

The principal aim of the study was to assess the frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infections and sinus rhythm restoration among patients who arrived at the ED with AF. Secondary aims included determining whether patients arriving at the ED principally due to AF delayed their presentations and whether the frequency of successful cardioversion for AF was decreased during the pandemic period. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of medical records of patients admitted to two hospital EDs due to AF during July–December 2019 (pre-pandemic period) versus July–December 2020 (pandemic period) was performed. Results: During the study periods, 601 ED visits by 497 patients were made due to the primary diagnosis of AF. The patients were aged 71.2+/−13.5 years and 51.3% were male. The duration of an AF episode before the ED admission was 10 h (4.5–30 h) during the pandemic period vs. 5 h (3–24 h) during the non-pandemic period (p = 0.001). A shorter duration of the AF episode before ED admission was associated with the successful restoration of the sinus rhythm. During the pandemic period, among patients with short-lasting AF who were not treated with Phenazolinum, the restoration of the sinus rhythm was more frequent in the Copernicus Memorial Hospital than in the University Hospital (p = 0.026). A positive SARS-CoV-2 test was found in 5 (1%) patients, while 2 other patients (0.5%) had a prior diagnosis of COVID-19 disease noted in their medical history. Conclusions: 1. The number of AF episodes treated in these two EDs was lower during the pandemic than non-pandemic period. 2. The patients with AF appeared at the ED later after AF onset in the pandemic period. 3. Successful cardioversion of atrial fibrillation was more frequent during the pre-pandemic period in one of the two hospitals. 4. A difference of approaches to the treatment of short-lasting AF episodes between EDs during the pandemic period may exist between these two EDs. 5.

In the UK, at least 10% of patient report symptoms at 12 weeks following a positive COVID-19 test. The aims of this quality improvement survey were to explore patients’ acute and post-acute “long” COVID-19 symptoms, their experiences of community services and their recommendations for improving these services. METHODS: Seventy patients diagnosed with COVID were randomly selected from 2 large socially and ethnically diverse primary care practices. Of those contactable by telephone, 85% (41/48) agreed to participate in the quality improvement survey. They were interviewed by telephone using a semi-structured questionnaire about community services for COVID-19 patients. Interviews lasted 10 to 15 minutes. RESULTS: Forty-nine percent of patients reported at least 1 post-acute COVID-19 symptom. The most common were severe fatigue (45%), breathlessness (30%), neurocognitive difficulties (such as poor memory), poor concentration and “brain fog” (30%), headaches (20%), and joint pain (20%). Many patients felt isolated and fearful, with scant information about community resources and little safety netting advice. Patients also expected more from primary care with over half (56%) recommending regular phone calls and follow up from healthcare staff as the most important approach in their recovery.

A real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to quantify Puumala virus before and after treatment with these products. Inactivation of Puumala virus was effective after 10min with all products except ethanol. Inactivation with absolute ethanol was effective only after 30min. Using the qRT-PCR method, this study has shown that the commercially available products Clidox®, Halamid-d® and Virkon®S in particular represent a rapid and safe way to decontaminate surfaces with possible Puumala virus contamination. These products can be used in solutions of 1–2%, with contact times greater than 10min, for inactivating effectively Puumala virus.","Maes, Piet; Li, Sandra; Verbeeck, Jannick; Keyaerts, Els; Clement, Jan; Van Ranst, Marc",Journal of Virological Methods,368,22

These challenges involve its actual and perceived role within the medical system, in particular how psychiatric hospitals can maintain their core mission of attending to people with mental illness while at the same time providing relief to overstretched general medicine services. Although psychiatric disorders comprise the leading cause of the global burden of disease, mental healthcare has been deemphasised in the wake of the onslaught of the pandemic: to make room for emergency care, psychiatric wards have been downsized, clinics closed, psychiatric support systems discontinued and so on. To deal with this pressing issue, we developed a pandemic contingency plan with the aim to contain, decelerate and, preferably, avoid transmission of COVID-19 and to enable and maintain medical healthcare for patients with mental disorders. AIMS: To describe our plan as an example of how a psychiatric hospital can share in providing acute care in a healthcare system facing an acute and highly infectious pandemic like COVID-19 and at the same time provide support for people with mental illness, with or without a COVID-19 infection. METHOD: This was a descriptive study. RESULTS: The plan was based on the German national pandemic strategy and several legal recommendations and was implemented step by step on the basis of the local COVID-19 situation. In addition, mid- and long-term plans were developed for coping with the aftermath of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: The plan enabled the University Hospital to maintain medical healthcare for patients with mental disorders. It has offered the necessary flexibility to adapt its implementation to the first and second waves of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany. The plan is designed to serve as an easily adaptable blueprint for psychiatric hospitals around the world.","Adorjan, Kristina; Pogarell, Oliver; Streb, Dorothee; Padberg, Frank; Erdmann, Christian; Koller, Gabriele; Raabe, Florian; Reich-Erkelenz, Daniela; de Jonge, Sylvia; Neumeier, Karin; Zill, Peter; Jauch, Karl-Walter; Schulze, Thomas G.; Falkai, Peter",BJPsych Open,368,1

Comprehensive efforts are being made globally toward the search of therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. Several drugs such as remdesivir, favipiravir, ritonavir, and lopinavir have been included in the treatment regimen and shown effective results in several cases. Among the existing broad-spectrum antiviral drugs, remdesivir is found to be more effective against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir has broad-spectrum antiviral action against many single-stranded RNA viruses including pathogenic SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV). In this study, we proposed that remdesivir strongly binds to membrane protein (Mprotein), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP), and main protease (Mprotease) of SARS-CoV-2. It might show antiviral activity by inhibiting more than one target. It has been found that remdesivir binds to Mprotease, Mprotein, and RDRP with −7.8, −7.4, and −7.1 kcal/mol, respectively. The structure dynamics study suggested that binding of remdesivir leads to unfolding of RDRP. It has been found that strong binding of remdesivir to Mprotein leads to decrease in structural deviations and gyrations. Additionally, the average solvent-accessible surface area of Mprotein decreases from 127.17 to 112.12 nm(2), respectively. Furthermore, the eigenvalues and the trace of the covariance matrix were found to be low in case of Mprotease–remdesivir, Mprotein–remdesivir, and RDRP–remdesivir. Binding of remdesivir to Mprotease, Mprotein, and RDRP reduces the average motions in protein due to its strong binding. The MMPBSA calculations also suggested that remdesivir has strong binding affinity with Mprotein, Mprotease, and RDRP. The detailed analysis suggested that remdesivir has more than one target of SARS-CoV-2.","Khan, Faez Iqbal; Kang, Tongzhou; Ali, Haider; Lai, Dakun",Front Pharmacol,368,22

STUDY DESIGN: Ethics approval was obtained from the University of Toronto’s Research Ethics Board (#39169). Responses were collected between March 20 and April 17, 2020, capturing the first month of government-mandated social distancing in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: We distributed the online survey to the University of Toronto student population, yielding a total convenience sample of 592 participants. We summarised the results and conducted Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis tests to explore relationships between demographic data and perceived severity of COVID-19. Pearson’s Chi-square tests were used to explore the relationship between demographic variables and perceived susceptibility, with phi being used to explore the strength of the association. A value of p ​< ​0.05 was used to determine significance. RESULTS: The majority of participants (60.1%) judged COVID-19 to be Very Severe; there was a significant relationship between being female and the adoption of new health behaviours. 57.4% indicated they felt susceptible to COVID-19, while 40.9% did not. Feeling susceptible was associated with studying a healthcare field or being personally affected by COVID-19. Individuals who stated they were not susceptible to COVID-19 declared mitigating factors such as new health behaviours to be a major driver in their perception. CONCLUSION: University students believe COVID-19 is a severe disease and have adopted new and increased health behaviours to mitigate the spread. While this study demonstrates differing health behaviour adoption rates based upon demographic factors, overall this research finds young adults supportive and accepting of government policy as a protective and susceptibility-mitigating measure.","Mant, M.; Holland, A.; Prine, A.",Public Health Pract (Oxf),368,21

However, many available SARS‐CoV‐2 diagnostic tests demonstrated a moderate sensitivity, 70%–80% is probably a reasonable estimate. Consequently, having useful tools for differential diagnosis becomes essential. In this scenario, lung ultrasound (LUS) may have an important role in the evaluation of lung involvement in hemodialysis patients during COVID‐19 pandemic. METHODS: We present two cases of hemodialysis patients with COVID‐19 pneumonia in whom LUS had a central role in the diagnostic process. Ultrasound images of COVID‐19 pneumonia show a typical bilateral pattern characterized by multiple or confluent B‐lines with spared areas, thickened and irregular pleural line, and rare subpleural consolidations. LUS showed high accuracy in diagnosing COVID‐19 pneumonia. FINDINGS: Despite both patients appeared clinically euvolemic and afebrile, they presented with acute diarrhea and oxygen saturation level of 92%–93%. Although clinical manifestations were mild and not specific in both patients, LUS raised suspicion on the possible COVID‐19 diagnosis which was confirmed by a positive nasopharyngeal RT‐PCR. DISCUSSION: There are many reasons for a patient on dialysis to present shortness of breath, fever, and multiple B‐lines at LUS assessment (such as heart failure, fluid overload, vascular access infection, interstitial pneumonia) but the recognition of typical ultrasound patterns of the COVID‐19 pneumonia is helpful for differential diagnosis. LUS may have an important role in the screening process of hemodialysis patients during the COVID‐19 pandemic, especially in oligosymptomatic patients before the SARS‐CoV‐2 diagnostic tests, and in those with suspected symptoms and/or known exposure with unexpected negative SARS‐CoV‐2 diagnostic tests.","Allinovi, Marco; Laudicina, Selene; Dallari, Lorenzo; Gianassi, Iacopo; Dervishi, Egrina; Biagini, Maria; Cirami, Lino",Hemodial Int,368,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We created a web-based survey with 34 items and collected data from 114 respondents from a range of health care professions and settings. We established the proportion of cognitive assessments which were face-to-face or via video or telephone conferencing, both pre- and post-March 2020. Further, we asked respondents about the assessment tools used and perceived barriers, challenges, and facilitators for the remote assessment of cognition. In addition, we asked questions specifically about the use of the Oxford Cognitive Screen. RESULTS: We found that the frequency of assessing cognition was stable compared to pre-pandemic levels. Use of telephone and video conferencing cognitive assessments increased by 10% and 18% respectively. Remote assessment increased accessibility to participants and safety but made observing the subtleties of behaviour during test administration difficult. The respondents called for an increase in the availability of standardised, validated, and normed assessments. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the pandemic has not been detrimental to the frequency of cognitive assessments. In addition, a shift in clinical practice to include remote cognitive assessments is clear and wider availability of validated and standardised remote assessments is necessary.IMPLICATIONS FOR REHABILITATIONWe caution the wider use and interpretation of remote formal cognitive assessments due to lack of validated, standardised, and normed assessments in a remote format.Clinicians should seek out the latest validation and normative data papers to ensure they are using the most up to date tests and respective cut offs.Support is needed for individuals who lack knowledge/have anxiety over the use of technology in formal cognitive assessments.","Webb, Sam S; Kontou, Eirini; Demeyere, Nele",Disabil Rehabil,368,1

Nevertheless, viruses have evolved different strategies to evade innate immune control. In this review, we describe recent findings delineating the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 and type I IFN response in vitro and in vivo and report current studies using IFN-based therapy for COVID-19 treatment. ABSTRACT: Among the many activities attributed to the type I interferon (IFN) multigene family, their roles as mediators of the antiviral immune response have emerged as important components of the host response to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Viruses likewise have evolved multiple immune evasion strategies to circumvent the host immune response and promote virus propagation and dissemination. Therefore, a thorough characterization of host–virus interactions is essential to understand SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Here, we summarize the virus-mediated evasion of the IFN responses and the viral functions involved, the genetic basis of IFN production in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the progress of clinical trials designed to utilize type I IFN as a potential therapeutic tool.","Palermo, Enrico; Di Carlo, Daniele; Sgarbanti, Marco; Hiscott, John",Biology (Basel),368,33
