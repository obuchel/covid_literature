3174,"A Combined Syndromic Approach to Examine Viral, Bacterial, and Parasitic Agents among Febrile Patients: A Pilot Study in Kilombero, Tanzania",2017-12-26,"The use of fever syndromic surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa is an effective approach to determine the prevalence of both malarial and nonmalarial infectious agents. We collected both blood and naso/oro-pharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs from consecutive consenting patients ≥ 1 year of age, with an axillary temperature ≥ 37.5°C, and symptom onset of ≤ 5 days. Specimens were analyzed using both acute febrile illness (AFI) and respiratory TaqMan array cards (Resp TAC) for multiagent detection of 56 different bloodstream and respiratory agents. In addition, we collected epidemiologic data to further characterize our patient population. We enrolled 205 febrile patients, including 70 children (1 < 15 years of age; 34%) and 135 adults (≥ 15 years of age; 66%). AFI TAC and Resp TAC were performed on 191 whole blood specimens and 115 NP/OP specimens, respectively. We detected nucleic acid for Plasmodium (57%), Leptospira (2%), and dengue virus (1%) among blood specimens. In addition, we detected 17 different respiratory agents, most notably, Haemophilus influenzae (64%), Streptococcus pneumonia (56%), Moraxella catarrhalis (39%), and respiratory syncytial virus (11%) among NP/OP specimens. Overall median cycle threshold was measured at 26.5. This study provides a proof-of-concept for the use of a multiagent diagnostic approach for exploratory research on febrile illness and underscores the utility of quantitative molecular diagnostics in complex epidemiologic settings of sub-Saharan Africa.","Hercik, Christine; Cosmas, Leonard; Mogeni, Ondari D.; Wamola, Newton; Kohi, Wanze; Houpt, Eric; Liu, Jie; Ochieng, Caroline; Onyango, Clayton; Fields, Barry; Mfinanga, Sayoki; Montgomery, Joel M.",Am J Trop Med Hyg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5929188/,43
4308,"Compassion in the Clinical Context: Constrained, Distributed, and Adaptive",2019-10-21,"BACKGROUND: Compassion is intrinsically situated within particular contexts and how these contexts can shape compassion has not been well-described. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to describe how individual and contextual challenges can impact compassion within critical care and palliative care settings. DESIGN: This qualitative study adopted phenomenology and autoethnography to inform data collection, and principles of activity theory and realist inquiry for data interpretation. PARTICIPANTS: Five clinicians who work in critical care (n = 3) and palliative care (n = 3) participated in the study. APPROACH: Qualitative data were obtained from ethnographic observations, interviews, and focus groups. Participants observed and recorded field notes (n = 53) on instances of suffering and compassion in their workplace settings. At the end of the study period, they participated in a focus group or individual interview to reflect on their experiences. Data was analyzed using constructivist grounded theory techniques and iteratively synthesized through group discussion and model building. KEY RESULTS: The findings reflected four phenomena associated with compassion in context: individual gaps and lapses in compassion, relational challenges, contextual constraints on compassion, and distributed compassion. Individual gaps and lapses in compassion involved inattention, intention vs. perception, personal capacity, and personal toll. Relational challenges included receptivity, fragmentation, and lack of shared understanding. Contextual constraints consisted of situational pressures, the clinical environment, gaps in education, and organizational culture. The distribution of compassion within teams and how teams adapt their behaviors in response to perceived needs for greater compassion modulated these challenges. CONCLUSIONS: The study illustrates the many ways in which compassion can be shaped by context and highlights the role of teamwork in identifying gaps and lapses in compassion and responding in a way that supports patients, families, and colleagues.

5389,Adult bacterial nasopharyngitis: A clinical entity?,1993-12-11,"High-level expression of the ORF6 gene of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been proved very difficult. In this work, we cloned and sequenced the ORF6 gene of PRRSV and found that it could not be expressed in Pichia pastoris strain GS115. Then, the ORF6 gene was modified and synthesized based on the codon bias, poly (A) signal of yeast expression system and secondary structure of 5′-end mRNA of foreign gene. The modified gene was inserted into the yeast expression vector pPICZαA, induced and expressed by the same methods. The recombinant protein with a molecular mass of approximately 23 kDa was screened by SDS-PAGE and identified by Western blot with convalescent sera of animals infected with CH-1a strain of PRRSV. The results indicated that it was similar to the native protein. The expression level of the recombinant protein could attain 2.0 g/L. In the meanwhile, the optimal conditions for expression were determined. It provides an additional means for studying the structural and functional characteristics of PRRSV ORF6 gene.","Qian, Ping; Li, Xiangmin; Tong, Guangzhi; Chen, Huanchun",Virus Genes,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089132/,43

18165,Exposure to Workplace Trauma and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Among Intern Physicians,2021-06-08,"Acute ethanol intoxication increases the risk of sepsis and aggravates the symptoms of sepsis and lung injury. Therefore, this study aimed to explore whether sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1)/sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)/S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) signaling pathway functions in lung injury caused by acute ethanol intoxication-enhanced sepsis, as well as its underlying mechanism. The acute ethanol intoxication model was simulated by intraperitoneally administering mice with 32% ethanol solution, and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was used to construct the sepsis model. The lung tissue damage was observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, and the wet-to-dry (W/D) ratio was used to evaluate the degree of pulmonary edema. Inflammatory cell counting and protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were, respectively, detected by hemocytometer and bicinchoninic acid (BCA) method. The levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, and IL-18 in BALF were detected by their commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and expression of apoptosis-related proteins and SphK1/S1P/S1PR1 pathway-related proteins were, respectively, analyzed by MPO ELISA kit and Western blot analysis. The cell apoptosis in lung tissues was observed by TUNEL assay. Acute ethanol intoxication (EtOH) decreased the survival rate of mice and exacerbated the lung injury caused by sepsis through increasing pulmonary vascular permeability, neutrophil infiltration, release of inflammatory factors, and cell apoptosis. In addition, EtOH could activate the SphK1/S1P/S1PR1 pathway in CLP mice. However, PF-543, as a specific inhibitor of SphK1, could partially reverse the deleterious effects on lung injury of CLP mice. PF-543 alleviated lung injury caused by sepsis in acute ethanol intoxication rats by suppressing the SphK1/S1P/S1PR1 signaling pathway.","Chen, Liang; Li, Lingling; Song, Yong; Lv, Tangfeng",Inflammation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8189277/,43

19016,Development and Validation of Computerized Adaptive Assessment Tools for the Measurement of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Among US Military Veterans,2021-07-08,"Curcumin, an active component of the rhizome turmeric, has gained much attention as a plant-based compound with pleiotropic pharmacological properties. It possesses anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, hypoglycemic, antimicrobial, neuroprotective, and immunomodulatory activities. However, the health-promoting utility of curcumin is constrained due to its hydrophobic nature, water insolubility, poor bioavailability, rapid metabolism, and systemic elimination. Therefore, an innovative stride was taken, and complexes of metals with curcumin have been synthesized. Curcumin usually reacts with metals through the β-diketone moiety to generate metal–curcumin complexes. It is well established that curcumin strongly chelates several metal ions, including boron, cobalt, copper, gallium, gadolinium, gold, lanthanum, manganese, nickel, iron, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, silver, vanadium, and zinc. In this review, the pharmacological, chemopreventive, and therapeutic activities of metal–curcumin complexes are discussed. Metal–curcumin complexes increase the solubility, cellular uptake, and bioavailability and improve the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and antiviral effects of curcumin. Metal–curcumin complexes have also demonstrated efficacy against various chronic diseases, including cancer, arthritis, osteoporosis, and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. These biological activities of metal–curcumin complexes were associated with the modulation of inflammatory mediators, transcription factors, protein kinases, antiapoptotic proteins, lipid peroxidation, and antioxidant enzymes. In addition, metal–curcumin complexes have shown usefulness in biological imaging and radioimaging. The future use of metal–curcumin complexes may represent a new approach in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases.","Prasad, Sahdeo; DuBourdieu, Dan; Srivastava, Ajay; Kumar, Prafulla; Lall, Rajiv",Int J Mol Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8268053/,43

The endothelial glycocalyx plays a critical role in glomerular barrier function. In the present study, the effects of piperazine ferulate (PF) on HG-induced filtration barrier injury of glomerular endothelial cells (GEnCs) were investigated and the underlying mechanism was assessed. Immunofluorescence was used to observe the distribution of the glycocalyx as well as the expression levels of syndecan-1 and Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1). Endothelial permeability assays were performed to assess the effects of PF on the integrity of the filtration barrier. Protein and mRNA expression levels were measured by western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR analyses, respectively. In vitro experiments revealed that adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) mediated HG-induced glycocalyx degradation and endothelial barrier injury. PF inhibited the HG-induced endothelial barrier injury and restored the expression levels of heparanase-1 (Hpa-1), ZO-1 and occludin-1 by AMPK. In vivo assays demonstrated that PF reduced the expression levels of Hpa-1, increased the expression levels of ZO-1 and attenuated glycocalyx degradation in the glomerulus. These data suggested that PF attenuated HG-induced filtration barrier injury of GEnC by regulating AMPK expression.","Yang, Yong-Yu; Chen, Zhuo; Yang, Xi-Ding; Deng, Rong-Rong; Shi, Ling-Xing; Yao, Liang-Yuan; Xiang, Da-Xiong",Exp Ther Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8393711/,43

61950,Highlights from the literature.,2021-04-01,"OBJECTIVES During the early ('containment') phase of the influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, when the severity of the pandemic was unclear, health care workers (HCWs) across the UK were deployed to swab and prescribe antiviral drugs to suspected cases. This study describes the knowledge, attitudes, experience and behaviour of frontline HCWs in Birmingham, West Midlands, during this period. METHODS During June 2009, a 25-item semi-structured questionnaire was used to survey HCWs who undertook defined clinical duties as part of the public health response during the early phase of the pandemic. Participants were clinical staff based in a primary care out-of-hours service provider. RESULTS The response rate was 50% (n = 20). All respondents provided direct clinical care that necessitated prolonged close contact with potentially infectious cases. Knowledge and use of personal protective equipment and infection control procedures was consistently high. However, the main source of infection control advice was local guidance. Uptake of, and attitude towards, vaccination as a preventive measure and antiviral prophylaxis was poor. CONCLUSIONS HCWs were prepared to provide an essential health care response during the pandemic even when the severity of disease was unclear. However, more needs to be done to change health care workers' negative attitudes towards taking antivirals and receiving influenza vaccination.","Edeghere, Obaghe; Fowler, Tom; Wilson, Fay; Caspa, Richard; Raichand, Smitri; Kara, Edna; Janmohamed Rampling, Sumi; Olowokure, Babatunde",Journal of health services research & policy,https://doi.org/10.1177/1355819614554243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25392369/,43
63172,Highlights from the literature.,2020-06-01,"OBJECTIVES Coach-centred antidoping education is scarce. We tested the efficacy of a motivationally informed antidoping intervention for coaches, with their athletes' willingness to dope as the primary outcome. METHODS We delivered a cluster randomised controlled trial in Australia, the UK and Greece. This study was a parallel group, two-condition, superiority trial. Participants were 130 coaches and 919 athletes. Coaches in the intervention group attended two workshops and received supplementary information to support them in adopting a motivationally supportive communication style when discussing doping-related issues with their athletes. Coaches in the control condition attended a standard antidoping workshop that provided up-to-date information on antidoping issues yet excluded any motivation-related content. Assessments of willingness to dope (primary outcome) and other secondary outcomes were taken at baseline, postintervention (3 months) and at a 2-month follow up. RESULTS Compared with athletes in the control group, athletes in the intervention group reported greater reductions in willingness to take prohibited substances (effect size g=0.17) and psychological need frustration (g=0.23) at postintervention, and greater increases in antidoping knowledge (g=0.27) at follow-up. Coaches in the intervention group reported at postintervention greater increases in efficacy to create an antidoping culture (g=0.40) and in perceived effectiveness of need supporting behaviours (g=0.45) to deal with doping-related situations. They also reported greater decreases in doping attitudes (g=0.24) and perceived effectiveness of need thwarting behaviours (g=0.35). CONCLUSIONS Antidoping education programmes should consider incorporating principles of motivation, as these could be beneficial to coaches and their athletes. We offer suggestions to strengthen these programmes, as most of the effects we observed were not sustained at follow-up.

MAIN CONCLUSION ECoV infection should be considered in horses presenting with acute onset of fever, especially when nasal discharge is absent as one of the cardinal clinical sign. APPROACH A total of 277 adult horses with acute onset of fever were enrolled in this study. Feces were tested for ECoV and nasal secretions for common respiratory pathogens (equine herpesvirus (EHV)-1, EHV-4, equine influenza virus (EIV), equine rhinitis viruses (ERVs) and Streptococcus equi ss. equi) and ECoV by qPCR. Each submission was accompanied by a questionnaire requesting information pertaining to signalment, use, recent transportation, number of affected horses on the premise and presence of clinical signs at the time of sample collection. RESULTS The total number of horses testing qPCR-positive for ECoV in feces was 20 (7.2%), 4 of which also tested qPCR-positive for ECoV in nasal secretions. In the same population 9.0% of horses tested qPCR-positive for EHV-4, 6.1% for EIV, 4.3% for Streptococcus equi ss. equi, 3.2% for ERVs and 0.7% for EHV-1. Draft horses, pleasure use, multiple horses affected on a premise and lack of nasal discharge were significantly associated with ECoV qPCR-positive horses. INTERPRETATION The present study results showed that 7.2% of horses with acute onset of fever tested qPCR-positive for ECoV in feces, highlighting the importance of testing such horses for ECoV in feces. The various prevalence factors associated with ECoV qPCR-positive status likely relate to the high infectious nature of ECoV and breed-specific differences in management and husbandry practices. SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS ECoV infection should be suspected and tested for in horses presenting with acute onset of fever, lethargy and anorexia with no respiratory signs. A two-step approach should be consider in which respiratory secretions and feces should be collected from such horses and submitted to a diagnostic laboratory. If the respiratory secretions test negative by qPCR for a panel of respiratory pathogens, feces already submitted to the laboratory should be tested for ECoV.","Pusterla, Nicola; James, Kaitlyn; Mapes, Samantha; Bain, Farifield",The Veterinary record,https://doi.org/10.1136/vr.104919; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30850426/,43

Data on this modality are primarily limited to small retrospective single-center series. OBJECTIVE To assess safety and efficacy of this treatment by establishing an international, multicenter collaboration. METHODS Consecutive posterior circulation aneurysms treated with the PED from 2012 to 2019 across 11 neurovascular centers were retrospectively reviewed. Baseline demographics, aneurysm and treatment characteristics, complications, occlusion status, and functional outcome were assessed. RESULTS There were 149 posterior circulation aneurysms treated with PED in 146 patients. A total of 24 (16.4%) patients presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage. Most aneurysms were dissecting/blister (36.2%) in morphology, followed by saccular (35.6%) and fusiform (28.2%). The most common locations were the vertebral (51.7%) and basilar arteries (22.8%). Complete or near-complete occlusion (>90%) was achieved in 90.9% of aneurysms at a median follow-up of 12 mo. Dissecting/blister aneurysms were most likely to occlude (P = .06). Symptomatic neurologic complications occurred in 9.4% of aneurysms, associated with larger size, ruptured presentation, presentations with brain stem compression, cranial nerve palsy, or stroke. Favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Score 0-2) was achieved in 86.2% of patients. There were 6 fatalities of which 4 occurred in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage patients. CONCLUSION This multicenter study shows that PED for the treatment of posterior circulation is preferentially used for the treatment of fusiform and dissecting/blister aneurysm morphologies. Despite the challenges presented by these less-common morphologies, flow diversion may be performed with a neurologic complication rate of about 10% and favorable long-term aneurysm occlusion rates.","Griessenauer, Christoph J; Enriquez-Marulanda, Alejandro; Taussky, Philipp; Biswas, Arundhati; Grandhi, Ramesh; Xiang, Sissi; Hong, Tao; Rinaldo, Lorenzo; Lanzino, Giuseppe; Brinjikji, Waleed; Burkhardt, Jan-Karl; Kan, Peter; Ghuman, Mandeep; Yang, Victor X D; Chen, Karen; Aziz-Sultan, Mohammad A; Ghorbani, Mohammad; Schirmer, Clemens M; Goren, Oded; Dalal, Shamsher S; Killer-Oberpfalzer, Monika; Müller-Thies-Broussalis, Erasmia; Koch, Matthew J; Stapleton, Christopher J; Patel, Aman B; Foreman, Paul M; Cress, Marshall C; Hirschl, Robert A; Krings, Timo; Zhang, Hongqi; Dmytriw, Adam A",Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/neuros/nyaa277; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32629474/,43

78091,COVID-19: Lessons from Thailand.,2021-01-01,"BACKGROUND It is vital to identify a surrogate last-known-well time to perform proper endovascular thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke; however, no established imaging biomarker can easily and quickly identify eligibility for endovascular thrombectomy and predict good clinical prognosis. OBJECTIVE To investigate whether low relative diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) signal intensity can be used as a predictor of good clinical outcome after endovascular thrombectomy in patients with acute ischemic stroke. METHODS We retrospectively identified consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke who were treated with endovascular thrombectomy within 24 hours of the last-known-well time and achieved successful recanalization (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction score ≥2b). Relative DWI signal intensity was calculated as DWI signal intensity in the infarcted area divided by DWI signal intensity in the contralateral hemisphere. Good prognosis was defined as a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 90 days after stroke onset (good prognosis group). RESULTS 49 patients were included in the analysis. Relative DWI signal intensity was significantly lower in the group with good prognosis than in the those with poor prognosis (median (IQR) 1.32 (1.27-1.44) vs 1.56 (1.43-1.66); p<0.01), and the critical cut-off value for predicting good prognosis was 1.449 (area under the curve 0.78). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed association of good prognosis after endovascular thrombectomy with low relative DWI signal intensity (OR=6.84; 95% CI 1.13 to 41.3; p=0.04).

We sought to calculate the prevalence of spitting on police officers in use of force incidents, as well as the demographic and situational factors associated with spitting. METHODS Data on spitting were compiled from more than 10,000 use of force incidents occurring at 81 agencies in eight different states in the US. RESULTS Spitting occurred in 3.6% of cases. Female and younger subjects and those using drugs and/or alcohol are more likely to spit on officers. Spitting is more likely to occur in incidents of longer duration, when officers use less force relative to subject resistance, when subjects are assaultive or engage in self-harm, and when subjects are hobbled. CONCLUSIONS Spitting on officers is common and may now constitute a significant work hazard. Implications for police practice are discussed.","Strote, Jared; Warner, Joey; M Scales, Robert; J Hickman, Matthew",Forensic science international,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.forsciint.2021.110747; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33743512/,43

Acellular dermal matrix materials, which allow surgeons to minimize skin graft donor site morbidity in the process of repairing injured areas, play a role in addressing these important issues. Many favorable reports have been published, but they are generally characterized by small sample sizes, limited objective testing, and retrospective analysis. There does appear to be some evidence for ADM application in patient populations in whom donor site availability (those with massive burns) or morbidity (children, the elderly) is a concern, but more studies are needed. In this article, the authors discuss the current applications for ADM in burn management, review the existing literature, and present opportunities for future research.","Wainwright, David J; Bury, Sean B",Aesthetic surgery journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/1090820x11418202; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21908820/,43

Recently, SARS-Cov-2 protease structure was released and may be exploited in in-silico studies in order to conduct molecular docking analysis. METHODS In particular, we compared the binding of two used antimalarial drugs (i.e. chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) which showed some potential clinical effects in COVID-19 patients, using as positive control tree antiviral recognized compounds, ritonavir, lopinavir and darunavir. RESULTS Our results showed that hydroxychloroquine but not chloroquine exhibited a significant binding activity to the main protease similar to that possessed by protease inhibitors tested for other viral infections. CONCLUSION Our data suggest that hydroxychloroquine may exert additional direct antiviral activity compared to chloroquine. In the absence of clinical studies comparing the efficacy of these two compounds, hydroxychloroquine may offer additional effects and may be considered as first choice.","Ronsisvalle, Simone; Panarello, Federica; Di Mauro, Rosaria; Bernardini, Renato; Volti, Giovanni Li; Cantarella, Giuseppina",Current pharmaceutical design,https://doi.org/10.2174/1381612826666201210092736; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33302855/,43

METHODS Data was collected for consecutive patients with ITM receiving lesional therapies from 2008 to 2018 in a retrospective review. Included patients did not have metastatic disease at time of starting on lesional therapy and were not on systemic therapy. The primary outcome was complete pathologic response (pCR). RESULTS Of 83 patients, 57 (69%) started treatment with IL-2, 10 (12%) with DPCP, 12 (14%) with CLT, and 4 (5%) with imiquimod. pCR was achieved in 34 patients (41%) overall, including 44% starting on IL-2, 20% on DPCP, 58% on CLT, and none on imiquimod (P = .024). With a median follow-up of 45 months, cumulative one-year overall survival was 86%, with the best survival in the CLT group. Forty-eight percent experienced common terminology criteria for adverse events grade 1 or 2 toxicity. A quarter of patients on DPCP discontinued therapy due to toxicity (P = .002).

The purpose of this study was to analyze conditional outcomes of CAT to determine which result in maximum angiographic benefits. METHODS Patients who received CAT for anterior circulation occlusive stroke between January 2017 and December 2018 were included. Angiographic and clinical outcomes were compared relative to BGC use, stroke etiology, and occlusion location. Multivariable analyses for first-pass reperfusion (FPR) and favorable clinical outcome were performed. RESULTS Of 160 included patients, the rates of FPR, successful reperfusion after CAT, final successful reperfusion, and favorable clinical outcome were 43.1%, 58.1%, 81.9%, and 60.6%, respectively. BGC use was associated with a higher rate of FPR, successful reperfusion after CAT, a lower rate of distal embolization, and faster reperfusion. Based on subgroup analysis, BGC usage in ICA, MCA M1 occlusion, and cardioembolism were associated with higher FPR, successful reperfusion after CAT, and lower distal embolization. Faster reperfusion was achieved in ICA occlusions and cardioembolisms. BGC usage was an independent predictor of FPR. Favorable clinical outcome was associated with male gender, low initial NIHSS score, fast onset to reperfusion, and FPR. CONCLUSIONS In CAT, BGC usage was associated with better angiographic outcomes, including higher FPR, successful reperfusion after CAT, prevention of distal embolization, and faster reperfusion, especially in proximal occlusions and cardioembolisms. These conditions may play a role in maximizing the benefits of CAT.","Kim, Yong-Won; Kang, Dong-Hun; Son, Wonsoo; Hwang, Yang-Ha; Kim, Yong-Sun; Shin, Jong Wook; Lim, Jeong-Wook; Koh, Hyeon-Song; Kwon, Hyon-Jo",Acta neurochirurgica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-021-04787-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33723972/,43

BACKGROUND Esophagectomy is a high-risk procedure with an incidence of major complications around 25% and short-term mortality around 4%. METHODS We systematically searched the Medline and Embase databases for studies investigating the associations between patient-related prognostic factors and anastomotic leakage, major postoperative complications (Clavien-Dindo ≥ IIIa), and/or 30-day/in-hospital mortality after esophagectomy for cancer. RESULTS Thirty-nine eligible studies identifying 37 prognostic factors were included. Cardiac comorbidity was associated with anastomotic leakage, major complications, and mortality. Male sex and diabetes were prognostic factors for anastomotic leakage and major complications. Additionally, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score > III and renal disease were associated with anastomotic leakage and mortality. Pulmonary comorbidity, vascular comorbidity, hypertension, and adenocarcinoma tumor histology were identified as prognostic factors for anastomotic leakage. Age > 70 years, habitual alcohol usage, and body mass index (BMI) 18.5-25 kg/m2 were associated with increased risk for mortality. CONCLUSIONS Various patient-related prognostic factors are associated with anastomotic leakage, major postoperative complications, and postoperative mortality following oncological esophagectomy. This knowledge may define case-mix adjustment models used in benchmarking or auditing and may assist in selection of patients eligible for surgery or tailored perioperative care.","van Kooten, Robert T; Voeten, Daan M; Steyerberg, Ewout W; Hartgrink, Henk H; van Berge Henegouwen, Mark I; van Hillegersberg, Richard; Tollenaar, Rob A E M; Wouters, Michel W J M",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-021-10734-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34482453/,43
104348,COVID-19 and Biomedical Publishing: Challenges and Prospects.,2020-10-01,"Handcycling performance is dependent on the physiological economy of the athlete, however handbike configuration and the biomechanical interaction between the two is also vital. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of crank length manipulations on physiological and biomechanical aspects of recumbent handcycling performance in highly trained recumbent handcyclists at a constant linear handgrip speed and sport-specific intensity. Nine competitive handcyclists completed a 3-min trial in an adjustable recumbent handbike in four crank length settings (150, 160, 170 & 180 mm) at 70% peak power output. Handgrip speed was controlled (1.6 m∙s-1 ) across trials with cadences ranging from 102 to 85 rpm. Physiological economy, heart rate and ratings of perceived exertion were monitored in all trials. Handcycling kinetics were quantified using an SRM (Schoberer Rad Messtechnik) powermeter and upper limb kinematics were determined using a 10-camera VICON motion capture system. Physiological responses were not significantly affected by crank length. However, greater torque was generated (p < 0.0005) and peak torque occurred earlier during the push and pull phase (p ≤ 0.001) in longer cranks. Statistical parametric mapping revealed that the timing and orientation of shoulder flexion, shoulder abduction and elbow extension was significantly altered in different crank lengths. Despite the biomechanical adaptations, these findings suggest that at constant handgrip speeds (and varying cadence) highly trained handcyclists may select crank lengths between 150 - 180 mm without affecting their physiological performance. Until further research, factors such as anthropometrics, comfort and self-selected cadence should be used to facilitate crank length selection in recumbent handcyclists.","Mason, Barry S; Stone, Benjamin; Warner, Martin B; Goosey-Tolfrey, Victoria L",Scandinavian journal of medicine & science in sports,https://doi.org/10.1111/sms.13859; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079394/,43

Although the incidence of viral infections in HLA-haploidentical HCT recipients who receive post-transplant cyclophosphamide (PTCy)-based graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis is reportedly increased, there are insufficient data describing the incidence of CRVIs and the impact of donor source and PTCy on transplant outcomes. Analysing patients receiving their first HCT between 2012 and 2017 for acute myeloid leukaemia, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes, we describe comparative outcomes between matched sibling transplants receiving either calcineurin-based GVHD prophylaxis (SibCNI, N = 1605) or PTCy (SibCy, N = 403), and related haploidentical transplants receiving PTCy (HaploCy, N = 757). The incidence of CRVIs was higher for patients receiving PTCy, regardless of donor type. Patients in the HaploCy cohort who developed a CRVI by day +180 had both a higher risk of treatment-related mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 2⋅14, 99% confidence interval (CI) 1⋅13-4⋅07; P = 0⋅002] and inferior 2-year overall survival (HR 1⋅65, 99% CI 1⋅11-2⋅43; P = 0⋅001) compared to SibCNI with no CRVI.

METHODS The aim of this study was to examine the evolving changes in the technique, outcome, and new strategies in management of postoperative leaks after MIE was performed at a single institution over a two-decade period. A retrospective chart review of 75 MIE operations was performed between November 2011 and September 2018 and this was compared to the initial series of 104 MIE operations performed by the same group between 1998 and 2007. Operative technique, outcomes, and management strategies of leaks were compared. RESULTS There were 65 males (86.7%) with an average age of 61 years. The laparoscopic/thoracoscopic Ivor Lewis esophagectomy became the preferred MIE approach (49% of cases in the initial vs. 95% in the current series). Compared to the initial case series, there was no significant difference in median length of stay (8 vs. 8 days), major complications (12.5% vs. 14.7%, p = 0.68), incidence of leak (9.6% vs. 10.6%, p = 0.82), anastomotic stricture (26% vs. 32.0%, p = 0.38), or in-hospital mortality (2.9% vs. 2.6%, p = 0.47). Management of esophageal leaks has changed from primarily thoracotomy ± diversion initially (50% of leak cases) to endoscopic stenting ± laparoscopy/thoracoscopy currently (87.5% of leak cases). CONCLUSION In a single-institutional series of MIE over two decades, there was a shift toward a preference for the laparoscopic/thoracoscopic Ivor Lewis approach with similar outcomes. The management of postoperative leaks drastically changed with predilection toward minimally invasive option with endoscopic drainage and stenting.","Gambhir, Sahil; Daly, Shaun; Maithel, Shelley; Putnam, Luke R; Nguyen, James; Smith, Brian R; Nguyen, Ninh T",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-019-07057-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31385074/,43

High resolution melt curve analysis previously detected a variant strain, N1/08, and the present study confirmed that this strain had emerged as a result of recombination between Australian subgroup 2 and 3 strains in the spike gene region, in a similar manner reported for turkey coronaviruses. The S1 gene for N1/08 had highest nucleotide similarity with subgroup 2 strains, which is interesting considering subgroup 2 strains have not been detected since the early 1990s. SimPlot analysis of the 7.2-kb 3' end of the N1/08 genome with the same region for other Australian reference strains identified the sites of recombination as immediately upstream and downstream of the S1 gene. A pathogenicity study in 2-week-old chickens found that N1/08 had similar pathogenicity for chicken respiratory tissues to that reported for subgroup 2 strains rather than subgroup 3 strains. The results of this study demonstrate that recombination is a mechanism utilized for the emergence of new strains of IBV, with the ability to alter strain pathogenicity in a single generation.","Hewson, Kylie A; Noormohammadi, Amir H; Devlin, Joanne M; Browning, Glenn F; Schultz, Bridie K; Ignjatovic, Jagoda",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,https://doi.org/10.1080/03079457.2014.914624; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24730363/,43

Neonatal mice with higher numbers of MMc and monocytes show enhanced resilience against cytomegalovirus infection. Similarly, higher numbers of MMc in human cord blood are linked to a lower number of respiratory infections during the first year of life. Our data highlight the importance of MMc in promoting fetal immune development, potentially averting the threats caused by early life exposure to pathogens.","Stelzer, Ina Annelies; Urbschat, Christopher; Schepanski, Steven; Thiele, Kristin; Triviai, Ioanna; Wieczorek, Agnes; Alawi, Malik; Ohnezeit, Denise; Kottlau, Julian; Huang, Jiabin; Fischer, Nicole; Mittrücker, Hans-Willi; Solano, Maria Emilia; Fehse, Boris; Diemert, Anke; Stahl, Felix R; Arck, Petra Clara",Nature communications,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-24719-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34349112/,43
123004,Bringing Back the Human Connection with a Tablet.,2020-07-06,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an important emerging virus that is highly pathogenic in aged populations and is maintained with great diversity in zoonotic reservoirs. While a variety of vaccine platforms have shown efficacy in young-animal models and against homologous viral strains, vaccine efficacy has not been thoroughly evaluated using highly pathogenic variants that replicate the acute end stage lung disease phenotypes seen during the human epidemic. Using an adjuvanted and an unadjuvanted double-inactivated SARS-CoV (DIV) vaccine, we demonstrate an eosinophilic immunopathology in aged mice comparable to that seen in mice immunized with the SARS nucleocapsid protein, and poor protection against a nonlethal heterologous challenge. In young and 1-year-old animals, we demonstrate that adjuvanted DIV vaccine provides protection against lethal disease in young animals following homologous and heterologous challenge, although enhanced immune pathology and eosinophilia are evident following heterologous challenge. In the absence of alum, DIV vaccine performed poorly in young animals challenged with lethal homologous or heterologous strains. In contrast, DIV vaccines (both adjuvanted and unadjuvanted) performed poorly in aged-animal models. Importantly, aged animals displayed increased eosinophilic immune pathology in the lungs and were not protected against significant virus replication. These data raise significant concerns regarding DIV vaccine safety and highlight the need for additional studies of the molecular mechanisms governing DIV-induced eosinophilia and vaccine failure, especially in the more vulnerable aged-animal models of human disease.","Bolles, Meagan; Deming, Damon; Long, Kristin; Agnihothram, Sudhakar; Whitmore, Alan; Ferris, Martin; Funkhouser, William; Gralinski, Lisa; Totura, Allison; Heise, Mark; Baric, Ralph S",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.06048-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21937658/,43
133530,Videoconsultation to overcome barriers during COVID-19.,2021-01-01,"OBJECTIVE This paper examines whether atypical depression is still a valid entity as a diagnosis subtype in the light of publications with most recent antidepressants. METHOD First, we present the origins of the diagnosis sub-specification of atypical depression, which is based on a different drug response to tricyclic antidepressants and mono amino oxydase inhibitors. Secondly, we discuss the different definitions that can be found for the terms of atypical depression. We present more specifically the definition of atypical depression as it is described in the DSM-IV, with its most important criterion: mood reactivity. Then we present a review of scientific publications questioning atypical depression validity as a clinical syndrome (based on medline researches). We will see whether this diagnosis is still relevant with the latest drugs used to treat mood disorders. A special focus is made on the link between atypical depression and bipolar disorder, based on Benazzi's work. RESULTS Most of publications confirm that atypical depression is a valid syndrome regarding first antidepressants clinical trials. Nevertheless, more studies with the latest antidepressants and atypical antipsychotics are needed to confirm this hypothesis. The link between atypical depression and bipolar disorders seems to be quite strong although it requires further investigations. DISCUSSION There are very few double-blind drug trials focusing on atypical depressions and results need to be confirmed by trials with new drugs. Moreover, we regret that there are no studies including cerebral imagery. More studies are also needed on neurobiology and psychotherapy specificity. CONCLUSION Atypical depression is still a useful concept, because of its specific clinical presentation, evolution and treatments, even if more studies should be done. Atypical depression could also be useful to diagnose more easily some bipolar disorders and should help clinicians to focus more on suicidal risks and addiction evaluation for these patients, considering the mood reactivity and the link with bipolar disorder. To conclude, we propose that atypical depression should still figure in the future DSM-V for these different reasons.","Lutz, M; Morali, A; Lang, J-P",L'Encephale,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.encep.2012.08.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23541919/,43
138058,Providing beds for children.,2021-06-17,"INTRODUCTION The Low-profile Visualized Intraluminal Support (LVIS) device is a new generation of self-expanding braided stent recently introduced in China for stent assisted coiling of intracranial aneurysms. The aim of our study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of the LVIS device in reconstructive treatment of vertebral artery dissecting aneurysms (VADAs). METHODS We retrospectively reviewed the neurointerventional database of our institution from June 2014 to May 2016. Patients who underwent endovascular treatment of VADAs with LVIS stents were included in this study. Clinical presentation, aneurysmal characteristics, technical feasibility, procedural complications, and angiographic and clinical follow-up results were evaluated. RESULTS 38 patients with VADAs who underwent treatment with LVIS stent were identified, including 3 ruptured VADAs. All VADAs were successfully treated with reconstructive techniques including the stent-assisted coiling (n = 34) and stenting only (n = 4). Post-procedural complications developed in 3 patients (7.9%) including two small brainstem infarctions and one delayed thromboembolic event. Complications resulted in one case of minor permanent morbidity (2.6%). There was no procedure-related mortality. The follow-up angiogram was available in 30 patients at an average of 8.3 months (range, 2 to 30 months), which revealed complete occlusion in 23 patients (76.7%), residual neck in five patients (16.7%), and residual sac in two patients (6.7%). The follow-up of 25 aneurysms with incomplete immediate occlusion revealed 22 aneurysms (88%) with improvement in the Raymond class. One aneurysm (3.3%) showed recanalization and required retreatment. Clinical followed-up at 5-28 months (mean 14.1 months) was achieved in 36 patients because two patients died of pancreatic cancer and basal ganglia hemorrhage, respectively. No new neurologic deterioration or aneurysm (re)bleeding was observed. CONCLUSIONS Our preliminary experience with reconstruction of VADAs with the LVIS device demonstrates that this treatment approach is feasible with good short-term angiographic and clinical outcomes. Long-term and larger cohort studies are necessary to determine long-term outcomes of this therapy.","Wang, Chuan-Chuan; Fang, Yi-Bin; Zhang, Ping; Zhu, Xuan; Hong, Bo; Xu, Yi; Liu, Jian-Min; Huang, Qing-Hai",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0180079; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28662097/,43
142144,Investigation of QT Prolongation with Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin for the Treatment of COVID-19.,2020-10-01,"OBJECTIVES The novel corona virus disease, which was initially reported in China in late 2019, has become a global pandemic affecting 330 million cases. COVID-19 affects predominantly the respiratory system, in addition to other organ systems, mainly the cardiovascular system. One of the hypotheses is that virus entering the target cells by binding to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 affecting hypothalamic pituitary axis could lead to dysautonomia which is measured by heart rate variability (HRV). HRV is a non-invasive measure of autonomic function that facilitates identification of COVID-19 patients at the risk of developing cardiovascular complications. So, we aimed to assess HRV in COVID patients and compare between COVID patients and normal controls. METHODS In a case control design, we compared 63 COVID-19 infected patients with 43 healthy controls matched for age and gender. Along with clinical characterization, heart rate variability was evaluated using ambulatory 5 min ECG in lead II and expressed in frequency and time domain measures. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0. RESULTS Mean age of the study population was 49.1 ± 14.2 years and 71 (66.9%) were males. Frequency domain measures high (HF) and low (LF) frequency powers were significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients compared to controls. HF/LF and LF/HF ratios were not different between groups. Time domain measures rMSSD (root mean square of successive RR interval differences) and SDNN (standard deviation of NN intervals) were significantly increased among COVID-19 subjects. COVID-19 infection was associated with increased parasympathetic activity as defined by rMSSD>40 {adjusted odds ratio 7.609 (95% CI 1.61-35.94); p=0.01} and SDNN>60 {adjusted odds ratio 2.620 (95% CI 1.070-6.44); p=0.035} after adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities. CONCLUSIONS Our study results showed increased parasympathetic tone in COVID patients. Early diagnosis of autonomic imbalance in COVID patients is needed to plan management and limit progression of disease.","Kaliyaperumal, Deepalakshmi; Rk, Karthikeyan; Alagesan, Murali; Ramalingam, Sudha",Journal of basic and clinical physiology and pharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1515/jbcpp-2020-0378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33705614/,43
144071,Lung Biopsy in Coronavirus-19 Pneumonia: A Case Report and Review of Literature.,2021-07-01,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading viral cause of severe pediatric respiratory illness, and a safe and effective vaccine for use in infancy and early childhood is needed. We previously showed that deletion of the coding sequence for the viral M2-2 protein (ΔM2-2) down-regulated viral RNA replication and up-regulated gene transcription and antigen synthesis, raising the possibility of development of an attenuated vaccine with enhanced immunogenicity. RSV MEDI ΔM2-2 was therefore evaluated as a live intranasal vaccine in adults, RSV-seropositive children, and RSV-seronegative children. When results in RSV-seronegative children were compared to those achieved with the previous leading live attenuated RSV candidate vaccine, vaccine virus shedding was significantly more restricted, yet the postvaccination RSV-neutralizing serum antibody achieved [geometric mean titer (GMT) = 1:97] was significantly greater. Surveillance during the subsequent RSV season showed that several seronegative RSV MEDI ΔM2-2 recipients had substantial antibody rises without reported illness, suggesting that the vaccine was protective yet primed for anamnestic responses to RSV. Rational design appears to have yielded a candidate RSV vaccine that is intrinsically superior at eliciting protective antibody in RSV-naïve children and highlights an approach for the development of live attenuated RSV vaccines.","Karron, Ruth A; Luongo, Cindy; Thumar, Bhagvanji; Loehr, Karen M; Englund, Janet A; Collins, Peter L; Buchholz, Ursula J",Science translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aac8463; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26537255/,43
144772,The use of Pregabalin in Intensive Care Unit in the Treatment of Covid-19-related Pain and Cough.,2021-07-01,"BACKGROUND Although our earlier videos demonstrated extrahepatic control of the hepatic arterial, portal venous, and biliary system, we have begun transecting the biliary system intraparenchymally for lesions distant from hilar plate and the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts.1 (-) 3 METHODS The patient was a 50-year old gentleman with synchronous colorectal hepatic metastasis, who underwent 6 cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with a Folfox-based regimen followed by laparoscopic right hepatectomy plus wedge resection of segment 4 and microwave ablation for a lesion in segment 2. This was followed 1 month later by laparoscopic proctocolectomy. Of note, the patient was also treated with Avastin for 1 month, which was stopped 2 months prior to his liver surgery. Pneumoperitoneum was obtained with the Veress needed; alternatively, the open technique may need to be used in patients who have undergone previous surgery. A 12-mm blunt tip balloon trocar was placed approximately 1 hand-breadth below the right costal margin. Two 12-mm working trocars were placed to the left and right of this optic trocar, and trocars were then placed in the left sub xiphoid region and in the right flank for the assistants. The right hepatic artery was triply clipped proximally and twice distally prior to being sharply transected. The right hepatic portal vein was then transected using a laparoscopic vascular GIA stapler device (TriStapler, Covidien, Norwalk, CT). The anterior surface of the liver was examined, and there was a clear line of demarcation along Cantlie's line. Using the ultrasonic shears (Harmonic Scalpel, Ethicon, Cincinnati, OH), the liver parenchyma was then transected. In the area of the right hepatic duct, the liver parenchyma was transected with a single firing of the laparoscopic GIA vascular stapler device. The right hepatic vein was then identified and similarly transected with a single firing of the laparoscopic vascular GIA stapler device. Hemostasis along the hepatic parenchyma was reinforced with the laparoscopic bipolar device. The two trocars on the right of the patient are connected into 1 incision, and a gel port is placed to facilitate removal of the specimen; alternatively, an old incision can be used. For patients who will need a laparoscopic or open colectomy, a lower midline incision is made. RESULTS From Jan 2009 to Oct 2010, 13 patients underwent right hepatectomy. The average age was 63.5 years (range, 46-87 years). The indication for surgery were all for cancer including 11 colorectal metastasis, 1 anal cancer metastasis, and 1 cholangiocarcinoma. In these 13 patients, 1 patient (7.7%) required conversion to an open approach because of bleeding, 1 additional patient required laparoscopic hand assistance, and the remaining patients were completed laparoscopically. There were no surgical mortalities at 30 or 90 days. Complications occurred in 2 (15%) patients, and included 1 patient who was converted to an open procedure because of hemorrhage and was complicated by a bile leak; the second patient with complication also developed a 1-bile leak, both of which responded to percutaneous treatments. The mean hospital stay was 7.7 days (range, 5-17 days). The mean operative time was 401 min (range, 220-600 min). The mean estimated blood loss was 878 cm(3) (range, 100-3,000 cm(3)). All patients underwent an R0 resection. DISCUSSION Laparoscopic major hepatectomy is feasible. As in open hepatectomies, intrahepatic transection of the right bile duct may be safer because there is a decreased risk of injury to the left hepatic duct.4 (,) 5 Larger series with longer-term follow-up are necessary.","Tsai, Tzu-Jung; Chouillard, Elie K; Gumbs, Andrew A",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-011-1927-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21822559/,43

RECENT FINDINGS Pandemic influenza typically results in large numbers of individuals with life-threatening pneumonia requiring treatment in ICUs. Clinical preparedness of ICUs relates to planning to provide increased 'surge' capacity to meet increased demand and requires consideration of staffing, equipment and consumables, bed-space availability and management systems. Research preparedness is also necessary, as timely clinical research has the potential to change the trajectory of a pandemic. The clinical research response during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic was suboptimal.

We developed and characterized flexible carbon-black doped TPU-based sEMG sensing structures. The structures are directly 3D-printed without the need for an additional post-processing step using a low-cost, consumer grade multi-material FDM printer. A comparison between the gold standard Ag/AgCl gel electrodes and the 3D-printed EMG electrodes with a comparable contact area shows that there is no significant difference in the EMG signals' amplitude. The sensors are capable of distinguishing a variable level of muscle activity of the biceps brachii. Furthermore, as a proof of principle, sEMG data of a 3D-printed 8-electrode band are analyzed using a patten recognition algorithm to recognize hand gestures. This work shows that 3D-printed sEMG electrodes have great potential in practical applications.","Wolterink, Gerjan; Dias, Pedro; Sanders, Remco G P; Muijzer, Frodo; van Beijnum, Bert-Jan; Veltink, Peter; Krijnen, Gijs",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s20154292; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32752062/,43

Design/methodology/approach - The information was obtained by applying an online survey to a sample of 295 residents in Tijuana, Mexico, who were repeat customers of the FDAs during COVID-19 quarantine. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA), the average variance explained (AVE) and composite reliability (CR) were conducted to ensure the validity of each construct. Multiple regression analysis was done to identify predictors of customers' continuance usage intention. Findings - Based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT-2), four constructs were included: effort expectancy, performance expectancy, food and beverage quality and price saving orientation. Multiple linear regressions were carried out to assess the relationship between the four dimensions and customers' continuance usage intention of FDAs. The results obtained show that effort expectancy, performance expectancy and price saving orientation influenced the customers' continuous usage behavior. Originality/value - This study contributes to the body of knowledge on consumer behavior on the continuance usage intention of FDAs during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has been scarcely studied.

180478,Highlights from this issue,2021,"Phage display links phenotype of displayed polypeptides with DNA sequence in phage genome and offers a universal method for discovery of proteins with novel properties. Injection of phage-displayed libraries in living organisms further provides a unique and powerful approach to optimize biochemical, pharmacological and biological properties of the displayed peptides, antibodies and other proteins in vivo. However, over 60% of the proteome is comprised of multi-domain proteins, and display of large multi-subunit proteins on phages remains a challenge. Majority of protein display systems are based on monovalent phagemid constructs but methods for robust display of multiple copies of large proteins are scarce. Here, we describe a DNA-encoded display of a ∼200 kDa tetrameric protein tetrameric L-asparaginase on M13 phage produced by ligation of SpyCatcher-Asparaginase fusion (ScA) to prospectively barcoded phage clones displaying SpyTag peptide. Starting from the SpyTag display on p3 minor coat protein or p8 major coat protein yielded constructs with five copies of ScA displayed on p3 (ScA5-phage) and 50 copies of ScA on p8 protein (ScA50-phage). ScA remained active after conjugation. It could be easily produced directly from lysates of bacteria that express ScA. Display constructs of different valency can be injected into mice and analyzed by deep-sequencing of the DNA barcodes associated phage clones. In these multiplexed studies, we observed a density-dependent clearance rate in vivo. A known clearance mechanism of L-asparaginase is endocytosis by phagocytic cells. Our observations, thus, link the increase in density of the displayed protein with the increased rate of the endocytosis by cells in vivo. In conclusion, we demonstrate that a multivalent display of L-asparaginase on phage could be used to study the circulation life of this protein in vivo and such approach opens the possibility to use DNA sequencing to investigate multiplexed libraries of other multi-subunit proteins in vivo.

We calibrated the model to English surveillance data using a Bayesian evidence synthesis framework, then modelled the potential trajectory of the epidemic for a range of different schedules for relaxing NPIs. Findings: The roadmap was successful in offsetting the increased transmission resulting from lifting NPIs with increasing population immunity through vaccination. However due to the emergence of Delta, with an estimated transmission advantage of 73% (95%CrI: 68-79) over Alpha, fully lifting NPIs on 21 June 2021 as originally planned may have led to 3,400 (95%CrI: 1,300-4,400) peak daily hospital admissions under our central parameter scenario. Delaying until 19 July reduced peak hospitalisations by three-fold to 1,400 (95%CrI: 700-1,500) per day. There was substantial uncertainty in the epidemic trajectory, with particular sensitivity to estimates of vaccine effectiveness and the intrinsic transmissibility of Delta. Interpretation: Our findings show that the risk of a large wave of COVID hospitalisations resulting from lifting NPIs can be substantially mitigated if the timing of NPI relaxation is carefully balanced against vaccination coverage. However, with Delta, it may not be possible to fully lift NPIs without a third wave of hospitalisations and deaths, even if vaccination coverage is high. Variants of concern, their transmissibility, vaccine uptake, and vaccine effectiveness must be carefully monitored as countries relax pandemic control measures.

Numerous research shows how various factors will affect travel after COVID-19. No doubt that tourism has become a major global industry with an annual average growth rate of 4-5%. It also creates 8% of the global GDP and 10% of employment. Yet it is also very vulnerable to crises of different origin such as natural disasters, epidemics, economic crises, political crises, terror, etc. Because tourism product (e.g. hotel beds, airline seats, restaurant tables, guide services) is perishable, unlike physical goods, they cannot be stored for future use. Past crises with few exceptions (e.g. 2008 Financial Crisis, 2014 Financial Crisis, the terroristic attack of airplane in Cairo 31st of October, 2015) had regional impacts and their global impact on tourism volume was limited. Yet, taking into account the speed and impact, Covid-19 is the most serious crises tourism industry has ever faced. This crisis is estimated to have a seven time larger impact on tourism than the 2008 Financial Crises. The effects of Covid-19 are expected to extend for two years and result in a decrease of 39-50% in global tourism volume.

The Covid-19 outbreak and subsequent lockdowns led to an unprecedented economic crisis in this sector. Governments had to block all unnecessary travel and keep only essential services moving, reducing public transport services (air, train, bus, metro, etc.) by more than 90%. Despite the economic aids provided by Governments, many LPT companies are facing a crisis that they are unlikely to be able to overcome. This for two reasons: skepticism of passengers in the use of public transport, and therefore reduced revenue from ticket sales, and additional costs for the vehicles’ sanitization Focusing on the Italian case, and especially on Sicily, the paper aims to analyze the standard costs of the LPT road service and assess the cost increase in which companies have to incur in order to meet the guidelines imposed by Government and encourage citizens to use public transport.

There was a major reduction in travel by people of child-bearing age. But the temporary regression in the spread, and preoccupation with COVID-19, seem to have overshadowed concern about Zika virus. In order to investigate this phenomenon, we conducted an online survey of 157 high-school students from four schools in different parts of the United States regarding their knowledge, practices, and attitudes about Zika virus. The mean age of the respondents was 16.4 +or- 1.1 years, 55% were girls, and 60% attended public (rather than private) schools. Most students (70%) had taken no steps to prevent Zika, but said they would tell their parents or a physician if they were exposed. They relied primarily on school and the internet (76% and 72%, respectively) as trusted sources of information about the virus. The majority (73%) said they would spend some time to learn more about Zika;girls exhibited more concern than did boys. Half (50%) of respondents knew the signs and symptoms of Zika, but only 20% knew all the ways Zika could be transmitted and 31% why Zika prevention was crucial for pregnant women and their partners.

However, past infection and vaccination may affect an individual's susceptibility to infection. Little research has evaluated whether annual vaccination is the best strategy. Using the United Kingdom as our motivating example, we assess the impact of different childhood vaccination strategies, specifically annual and biennial (every other year), on attack rate and expected number of infections. Methods and Findings: We present a multi-annual, individual-based, stochastic, force of infection model that accounts for individual exposure histories and disease/vaccine dynamics influencing susceptibility. We simulate birth cohorts that experience yearly influenza epidemics and follow them until age 18 to determine attack rates and the number of childhood infections. We perform simulations under baseline conditions, with an assumed vaccination coverage of 44%, to compare annual vaccination to no and biennial vaccination. We relax our baseline assumptions to explore how our model assumptions impact vaccination program performance. At baseline, we observed more than a 50% reduction in the number of infections between the ages 2 and 10 under annual vaccination in children who had been vaccinated at least half the time compared to no vaccination. When averaged over all ages 0-18, the number of infections under annual vaccination was 2.07 (2.06, 2.08) compared to 2.63 (2.62, 2.64) under no vaccination, and 2.38 (2.37, 2.40) under biennial vaccination. When we introduced a penalty for repeated exposures, we observed a decrease in the difference in infections between the vaccination strategies. Specifically, the difference in childhood infections under biennial compared to annual vaccination decreased from 0.31 to 0.04 as exposure penalty increased. Conclusion: Our results indicate that while annual vaccination averts more childhood infections than biennial vaccination, this difference is small. Our work confirms the value of annual vaccination in children, even with modest vaccination coverage, but also shows that similar benefits of vaccination can be obtained by implementing a biennial vaccination program.","Ainslie, K.

185394,Pilot survey of the diagnosis and management of heart failure in primary care: a Singaporean perspective.,2004,"PurposeIn responding to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, drastic public health measures such as social distancing and lockdowns have been implemented across the globe to slow the spread of the virus. In the USA, the public's reaction to social distancing has been mixed, evident in a high number of people flocking to beaches, bars and shops as coronavirus cases soar. Public health officials have issued strong warnings about the danger people face but the problem persists. To fill this gap, informed by the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this research explores why many people refuse to practice social distancing.Design/methodology/approachTwo studies were conducted during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. In the first study, a sample of 750 respondents was recruited from a US online consumer panel to complete a structured survey questionnaire. The data were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. In the second study, an open-ended questionnaire was administered to 50 US online participants to further uncover people's in-depth perceptions and perspectives toward the pandemic and social distancing. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the data.FindingsThe results from the first study show that risk-taking attitude, authoritarianism and subjective norm are significant predictors of social distancing intention and behavior, through perceived severity of COVID-19. Four themes emerged from the second study, which are consistent with the proposed conceptual framework in the first study.Originality/valueTheoretically, the authors’ findings first contribute to the emerging marketing literature that focuses on creating sustained positive changes and improving the well-being of consumers, communities and societies. Secondly, their findings corroborate with previous findings documented in the social influence literature by showing that during the times of uncertainty and confusion such as COVID-19, social norms (not forced by laws and regulations) play the most critical role in influencing a voluntary, socially beneficial behavior (such as social distancing). Third, this study extends the application of the TPB into the realm of social distancing behavior. The three main components of the TPB, namely attitude, behavioral control and subjective norm, are shown to predict social distancing behavior. Practically, the results of this research have important implications for public health policies on how to encourage positive public health behavior amid pandemics such as COVID-19.","Ang, Tyson Wei Shuqin Arli Denni",Marketing Intelligence & Planning,https://doi.org/10.1108/mip-08-2020-0352,43

We need to understand why we were all caught unprepared. On the one hand, we have all short memories. As we forget too quickly, we were unable to recognize key factors influencing response and preparedness to public health threats. For many years, economic evaluation pushed governments all over the world to cut resources for public health systems, with COVID-19 pandemic the question arises: do we spend too much or too little on health care? What is the right amount to spend on health? Moreover, in many countries, the privatisation, or semi-privatisation, of healthcare may give rise to inequitable access to health care for everyone. Although COVID-19 is very “democratic”, its consequences aren’t. According to OECD, income inequality in OECD countries is at its highest level for the past half century. Three main causes have been recognized, technological revolution, globalization, and “financialisation”. In this scenario, lockdown measures adopted to save lives are showing dramatic economic consequences. To address post COVID-19 reconstruction we need to go beyond GDP. As an economic measure this has many shortcomings in describing the real well-being of a country, and since what we measure affects what we do, new paradigms will have to guide the post COVID-19 reconstruction strategies, as the fate of countries and their citizens is at stake.","Illario, M; Zavagli, V; Ferreira, L Noronha; Sambati, M; Teixeira, A; Lanata, F; Pais, S; Farrell, J; Tramontano, D",Transl Med UniSa,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7789920/,43

Characterization of SARS-CoV N multimerization may thereby help us better understand the coronavirus assembly. In the current work, using the yeast two-hybrid technique, an unexpected interaction between residues 1-210 and 211-290 (central region) of the SARS-CoV N protein was detected, and SPR results further revealed that the SR-rich motif (amino acids 183-197) of SARS-CoV N protein is responsible for such an interaction. Chemical cross-linking and gel-filtration analyses indicated that the residues 283-422 of the SARS-CoV N protein have multimeric ability, although the full-length N protein is prone to exist predominantly as dimers. In addition, the multimeric ability of the C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV N protein could be weakened by the SR-rich motif interaction with the central region (amino acids 211-290). All of these data suggested that the SR-rich motif of the SARS-CoV N protein might play an import role in the transformation of the SARS-CoV N protein between the dimer and multimer during its binding to its central region for self-association or dissociation. This current paper will hopefully provide some new ideas in studying SARS-CoV N multimerization.","Luo, Haibin; Ye, Fei; Chen, Kaixian; Shen, Xu; Jiang, Hualiang",Biochemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16285739/,43

All nonessential businesses were closed during this time, and health care services were reorganized. On March 11, the Stoma Care Center started providing telehealth services for patients with a stoma. PURPOSE This retrospective observational study describes the experience of the Stoma Care Center of the University Hospital Federico II, Naples, Italy, before and during the lockdown. METHODS Consultation records from January 1 through April 29 were retrieved, patient demographics and reasons for consultation abstracted, and pre-lockdown (January 1 to February 29) and lockdown (March 1 to April 29) information was compared. Patients who used telehealth services were also asked to rate their satisfaction with these services on a scale of 0 (extremely dissatisfied) to 4 (extremely satisfied). The authors analyzed all consultations provided from January to April 2020 and evaluated the use of telemedicine services for patients with an ostomy. Consultations were divided into 2 groups. Group A included consultations provided from January 1 to February 29. Group B included consultations provided from March 1 to April 29, which included the lockdown period. Group B included both in-person and telemedicine consultations. RESULTS During the pre-lockdown period, 240 in-person consultations were provided. During the lockdown period, 181 in-person and 99 telemedicine consultations were provided. The number of in-person consultations for mechanical bowel preparation and transanal irrigation system training was lower (12.5% vs 6.6% [P = .046] and 3.3% vs 0% [P = .03]), whereas the number of consults for stoma care follow-up and stoma complications was higher (202 [84.1%] vs 266 [95%]). Of the 65 patients who completed the questionnaire, 82% indicated being extremely satisfied. CONCLUSIONS The reorganization of stoma care services, including the availability of telemedicine, did not result in a decrease in the number of consultations provided. The results suggest that stoma care services using telemedicine may provide valid support for patients with an ostomy in the future.","Dinuzzi, Vincenza Paola; Palomba, Giuseppe; Minischetti, Maria; Amendola, Alfonso; Aprea, Pierluigi; Luglio, Gaetano; De Palma, Giovanni Domenico; Aprea, Giovanni",Wound management & prevention,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33448938/,43

Worldwide, health care centers are working more than their capacity with the scarcity of medical resources. Cancer patients are considered to be at higher risk of developing life-threatening complications from COVID-19 and at the same time treatment delays can lead to poorer oncological outcomes. Appropriate planning is therefore important to continue with cancer treatment services and simultaneously avoiding the risk of infection to the patients and healthcare staff and not allowing community transmission of viral infection. Methods and Results We modified our practice measures in cancer patients receiving systemic therapy. Tele-consultations and use of electronic means, providing the best supportive care at or near home, and involvement of local/ family physicians were widely practiced. We minimised in-patient admissions, however, day-care chemotherapies were continued to provide optimum oncology services. Conclusions Modified oncological practice measures need to be implemented as the pandemic seems to stay for a longer time.","Sundriyal, Deepak; Sehrawat, Amit; Kumar, Parmod; Bhandari, Rekha",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602680/,43

The endosomotropic weak bases chloroquine and ammonium chloride do not prevent MHV4 infection. In marked contrast, we have selected variants from a neural cell line persistently infected with MHV4 which are entirely dependent on acid pH to fuse host cells and are strongly inhibited by endosomotropic weak bases. Wild-type and variant viruses were compared at the level of the fusion-active surface (S) glycoprotein gene. Cloning and sequencing of each 4,131-base open reading frame predicted a total of eight amino acid differences which fell into three distinct clusters. Each S glycoprotein, when expressed from cDNA, was synthesized in equivalent amounts, and similar proportions were transported to the cell surface. Wild-type S induced cell-cell fusion at neutral pH, whereas variant S required prolonged exposure to acidic pH to induce fusion. Expression of hybrid S genes prepared by exchange of restriction fragments between wild-type and variant cDNAs revealed that elimination of neutral pH fusion was solely dependent on amino acid alterations at positions 1067 (Q to H), 1094 (Q to H), and 1114 (L to R). These changes lie within a predicted heptad repeat region of the transmembrane cleavage fragment of S (S2).

Thirty of these commercial herds had a clinical history of TGEV infection and a positive TGEV fluorescent antibody test recorded at necropsy within the last 35 months, while 70 herds had no history of clinical TGEV infection. The blocking ELISA and the VN showed good agreement (kappa 0.84) for the detection of porcine coronavirus antibody (TGEV or PRCV). The sensitivity (0.933) of the ELISA to identify TGEV-infected herds was good when considered on a herd basis. The ELISA was also highly specific (0.943) for the detection of TGEV-infected herds when the test results were evaluated on a herd basis. When sera from specific age groups were compared, the ELISA identified a greater proportion (0.83) of pigs in herds with TGEV antibody when suckling piglets were used. In repeatability experiments, the ELISA gave consistent results when the same sera were evaluated on different days (kappa 0.889) and when sera were evaluated before and after heating (kappa 0.888). The blocking ELISA was determined to be useful for herd monitoring programs and could be used alone without parallel use of the VN assay for the assessment of large swine populations for the detection of TGEV-infected herds.","Carman, Susy; Josephson, Gaylan; McEwen, Beverly; Maxie, Grant; Antochi, Mioara; Eernisse, Ken; Nayar, Gopi; Halbur, Pat; Erickson, Gene; Nilsson, Ernst","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11939346/,43

RAND staff reviewed available literature on the Kurdistan Region and information relevant to primary care; interviewed a wide range of policy leaders, health practitioners, patients, and government officials to gather information and understand their priorities; collected and studied all available data related to health resources, services, and conditions; and projected future supply and demand for health services in the Kurdistan Region; and laid out the health financing challenges and questions. In this volume, the authors describe the strengths of the health care system in the Kurdistan Region as well as the challenges it faces. The authors suggest that a primary care-oriented health care system could help the KRG address many of these challenges. The authors discuss how such a system might be implemented and financed, and they make recommendations for better utilizing resources to improve the quality, access, effectiveness, and efficiency of primary care.","Moore, Melinda; Anthony, C Ross; Lim, Yee-Wei; Jones, Spencer S; Overton, Adrian; Yoong, Joanne K",Rand health quarterly,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28083330/,43

The method was applied to partially purified tissue culture-adapted or egg-adapted mammalian and avian coronaviruses and to clarified fecal samples from diarrheic calves and turkey poults for detection of enteric coronaviruses. Aggregates of virus coated with specific antibody were seen in virus samples mixed with homologous antiserum but not in control samples containing preexposure serum. At least a 10-50-fold enhancement of the sensitivity of direct EM for virus detection was obtained using protein A-colloidal gold complex as an electron-dense marker. The PAG-IEM method demonstrated low nonspecific background labeling and permitted detection of soluble and particle-associated antigen. Reciprocal cross-reactivity was detected among the subgroup of mammalian hemagglutinating coronaviruses, and antisera to 4 members of other subgroups only recognized their homologous virus.","Dea, S; Garzon, S","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1662078/,43

191584,Risk Factors for Severe Adenovirus Infection in Children during an Outbreak in Singapore.,2015,"OBJECTIVE To explore the application effect of five-in-one nursing management in the rapid recovery of patients undergoing thoracic surgery. METHODS This prospective study included 45 patients admitted to thoracic surgery before the implementation of five-in-one nursing as the control group and 40 patients admitted during the implementation as the test group. The patients in the control group were nursed by conventional nursing plan, whole those in the test group received the five-in-one nursing management. The perioperative indicators, mental state, postoperative rehabilitation, surgical complications, and nursing satisfaction were compared between the two groups. RESULTS Compared with the control group, the time of extubation, the time of getting out of bed for the first time, the recovery time of bowel sounds, the time of the first defecation, and the length of hospital stay in the experimental group were significantly shortened (P<0.05). At 24 h after surgery, MTL and GAS levels of patients in the test group were significantly higher than those of the control group (P<0.001). Moreover, the test group had lower visual analogue score (VAS) at different times after the operation, as well as lower the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) scores after nursing than the control group (P<0.001). The total incidence of postoperative complications in the experimental group was significantly reduced, while nursing satisfaction was significantly increased (P<0.001) when compared with the control group. CONCLUSION The five-in-one nursing management effectively promoted the rapid recovery of patients after thoracic surgery, shortened the length of hospital stay, and improved nursing satisfaction.","Zhou, Fen; Yu, Minghong",American journal of translational research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34377287/,43
191633,A cross-sectional study on reference ranges of normal oral temperatures among students in Singapore.,2009,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a leading cause of illness and death in China. Approximately 60% of the population has a history of HBV infection, and 9.8% of persons in China are chronically infected with HBV and at risk for premature death from liver disease. Each year, an estimated 263,000 persons in China die from HBV-related liver cancer or cirrhosis, accounting for 37%-50% of HBV-related deaths worldwide. Because most HBV infections occur during infancy or early childhood, when HBV infection is most likely to become chronic, vaccination of infants beginning at birth is the key strategy for preventing chronic HBV infection. This report describes China's progress in increasing coverage among infants with hepatitis B vaccine (HepB) and timely administration of the HepB birth dose (i.e., within 24 hours of birth). Infant vaccination coverage with both the timely birth dose and the complete vaccine series was substantially higher among children born during 2003 than among those born during 1997; timely birth-dose coverage increased from 29.1% to 75.8%, and HepB series completion increased from 70.7% to 89.8%. Furthermore, in economically disadvantaged populations in western and middle provinces targeted by the China-Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (China-GAVI) project, reported coverage with timely HepB birth dose increased from 64% in 2004 to 81% in 2006, and coverage with the complete HepB series increased from 52% in 2001 to 92% in 2006. China has established a goal to reduce chronic HBV infection among children aged <5 years to <1% by 2010. Achieving this goal will require continued commitment to increasing vaccination coverage in impoverished regions and ensuring that infants born at home are vaccinated within 24 hours of birth.",,MMWR.

191917,Concept of operations for triage of mechanical ventilation in an epidemic.,2006,"Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was deemed a pandemic on 11 March 2020, we have seen exponential increases in the number of cases and deaths worldwide. The rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation requires revisions to clinical practice to defer non-essential clinical services to allocate scarce medical resources to the care of the COVID-19 patient and reduce risk to healthcare workers. Chronic pain patients require long-term multidisciplinary management even during a pandemic. Fear of abandonment, anxiety and depression may increase during this period of social isolation and aggravate pain conditions. Whilst physical consults for chronic pain patients were reduced, considerations including continuity of support and analgesia, telemedicine, allied health support and prioritising necessary pain services and interventions, were also taken to ensure biopsychosocial care for them. Chronic pain patients are mostly elderly with multiple comorbidities, and are more susceptible to morbidity and mortality from COVID-19. It is imperative to review pain management practices during the COVID-19 era with respect to infection control measures, re-allocation of healthcare resources, community collaborations, and analgesic use and pain interventions. The chronic pain patient faces a potential risk of functional and emotional decline during a pandemic, increasing healthcare burden in the long term. Clinical decisions on pain management strategies should be based on balancing the risks and benefits to the individual patient. In this commentary, we aim to discuss the basis behind some of the decisions and safeguards that were made at our tertiary pain centre over the last 6 months during the COVID-19 outbreak.","Chan, Diana Xh; Lin, Xu Feng; George, Jane Mary; Liu, Christopher W","Annals of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33241255/,43

192860,Head and Neck Surgery Residency during Covid-19 Pandemic. Lessons from Southern Italy.,2020-12-01,"We describe the construction of plasmids which express fusion proteins representing various regions of Germiston virus M polyprotein. The fusion proteins were purified and inoculated into rabbits to produce antisera. The N- and C-terminal regions of the polyprotein induced specific antibodies which reacted with glycoproteins G2 and G1, respectively, and the intermediate region induced antibodies against the NSM polypeptide. This enabled us to determine the gene order: G2-NSM-G1. Glycoproteins G1 and G2 form the spikes on the surface of the virion. We attempted to determine the structural organization of the glycoproteins by using a membrane-permeable cross-linking reagent, dimethyl suberimidate, but were unable to demonstrate that G1 and/or G2 form oligomeric structures. We analysed the glycoproteins further and showed that, like peripheral membrane proteins, the G2 and NSM proteins are almost completely extracted into the aqueous phase of detergent Triton X114-treated cellular extracts, whereas glycoprotein G1 is distributed in almost equal proportions between the aqueous and the detergent fractions. This indicates that G1 is a membrane-associated protein, but its presence in the aqueous phase suggests that it is less hydrophobic than a typical membrane protein. We have also characterized the intracellular transport of the envelope glycoproteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex. Pulse-chase labelling followed by immunoprecipitation and treatment with endoglycosidase H (endo H) showed that both G1 and G2 are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi complex. Conversion to the endo H-resistant form is a rather slow process which takes more than 2 h. The mature G1 and G2 proteins present in the virion particle contain almost completely endo-H-resistant glycans.","Gerbaud, S; Pardigon, N; Vialat, P; Bouloy, M",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1402815/,43

Therefore, in this study we evaluated the pathogenesis of all possible combinations of one, two, or three viruses in comparison to sham inoculates in 3-day-old turkey poults. Body weights were recorded at 2, 4, 7, 10, and 14 days postinoculation (PI) and were decreased in virus-infected turkeys throughout the experiment as compared to sham inoculates. Although not significantly different from the other virus-exposed groups, the poults exposed to all three viruses had the lowest body weights throughout the experiment. Clinical signs, including huddling, diarrhea, and agitation, were only observed in groups exposed to TAstV-2 and/or TRotV. At 4 days PI, birds from each treatment group were necropsied, and pale intestines with watery contents and undigested feed were observed in the groups that were exposed to TRotV + TReoV or TRotV + TAstV-2 and the group exposed to all three viruses. Minimal microscopic lesions were observed in the intestines of turkeys infected with TAstV-2, TReoV, or a combination of both. In the turkeys infected with TRotV, either alone or in combination with other viruses, mild microscopic lesions were found in all sections of the small intestine and viral antigen was identified by immunohistochemical staining in mature enterocytes. No or very mild lesions were observed in other organs with the exception of the bursa of Fabricius, where mild to severe atrophy was observed in all virus-infected poults examined. Cloacal shedding of TAstV-2 and TRotV was evaluated by reverse-transcription PCR testing of cloacal swabs and minimal differences were observed among the treatment groups.","Spackman, Erica; Day, J Michael; Pantin-Jackwood, Mary J",Avian diseases,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20408393/,43

194158,Dengue research in Singapore marking the inaugural ASEAN Dengue Day.,2011,"The p28 and p65 proteins of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) are the most amino-terminal protein domains of the replicase polyprotein. Cleavage between p28 and p65 has been shown to occur in vitro at cleavage site 1 (CS1), (247)Gly downward arrow Val(248), in the polyprotein. Although critical residues for CS1 cleavage have been mapped in vitro, the requirements for cleavage have not been studied in infected cells. To define the determinants of CS1 cleavage and the role of processing at this site during MHV replication, mutations and deletions were engineered in the replicase polyprotein at CS1. Mutations predicted to allow cleavage at CS1 yielded viable virus that grew to wild-type MHV titers and showed normal expression and processing of p28 and p65. Mutant viruses containing predicted noncleaving mutations or a CS1 deletion were also viable but demonstrated delayed growth kinetics, reduced peak titers, decreased RNA synthesis, and small plaques compared to wild-type controls. No p28 or p65 was detected in cells infected with predicted noncleaving CS1 mutants or the CS1 deletion mutant; however, a new protein of 93 kDa was detected. All introduced mutations and the deletion were retained during repeated virus passages in culture, and no phenotypic reversion was observed. The results of this study demonstrate that cleavage between p28 and p65 at CS1 is not required for MHV replication. However, proteolytic separation of p28 from p65 is necessary for optimal RNA synthesis and virus growth, suggesting important roles for these proteins in the formation or function of viral replication complexes.","Denison, Mark R; Yount, Boyd; Brockway, Sarah M; Graham, Rachel L; Sims, Amy C; Lu, XiaoTao; Baric, Ralph S",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15140993/,43

A real-time PCR assay was developed which has a linear dynamic range of 5 to 5 x 10(6) copies of HHV-6 and a sensitivity of five gene copies per reaction. While the assay detects both subtypes, HHV-6A and HHV-6B, it is specific and does not cross-react with a selected specificity panel. A total of 1,482 patient specimens, which were collected between 2003 and 2007, were tested; 26 specimens from 24 patients were found to be positive for HHV-6 by real-time PCR. The HHV-6 detection rate in this population was therefore 1.75%. The majority of the specimens tested (>95%) were cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens. We were able to type 20 of the 26 positive specimens by conventional PCR and sequence analysis; all were HHV-6B. Forty-two percent of the patients were 3 years of age or younger, which may indicate a primary infection in these patients. Given the ages of the remaining patients (from 4 to 81 years), their infections were most probably due to virus reactivations. Where information was available, symptoms of patients included fever (71%), altered mental status (67%), and abnormal CSF profile (75%). Fifty percent of patients of 3 years of age or younger suffered from seizures. The detection of HHV-6 in specimens from patients diagnosed with encephalitis or meningitis, in the absence of a positive PCR result for other agents, strongly suggests a role for HHV-6 in the pathogenesis of these central nervous system diseases.","Tavakoli, Norma P; Nattanmai, Seela; Hull, Rene; Fusco, Heather; Dzigua, Lela; Wang, Heng; Dupuis, Michelle",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17942643/,43

The interaction of JUNV with two types of polarized epithelial cultures, Vero C1008 and A549, was investigated. Radioactive virus-binding assays showed that JUNV infects polarized lines preferentially through the apical surface. High-level expression of viral nucleoprotein was detected in polarized cell lines infected through the apical domain. Virus production from apical media was about 100-fold higher than that found into the basolateral medium. Confocal-immunofluorescence analysis revealed high-level expression of glycoprotein at the apical-membrane surface. Disruption of the microtubule network by colchicine impaired JUNV vectorial release. This is the first study to analyse the interaction between a member of the virus family Arenaviridae and polarized epithelial cells, showing preferential entry and release from the apical plasma membrane.","Cordo, Sandra M; Cesio y Acuña, Maximiliano; Candurra, Nélida A",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15831960/,43

However, the clinical course of COVID-19 in pregnancy and risk of vertical and horizontal transmission remain relatively unknown. We aim to describe and evaluate outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19 in Singapore. METHODS Prospective observational study of 16 pregnant patients admitted for COVID-19 to 4 tertiary hospitals in Singapore. Outcomes included severe disease, pregnancy loss, and vertical and horizontal transmission. RESULTS Of the 16 patients, 37.5%, 43.8% and 18.7% were infected in the first, second and third trimesters, respectively. Two gravidas aged ≥35 years (12.5%) developed severe pneumonia; one patient (body mass index 32.9kg/m2) required transfer to intensive care. The median duration of acute infection was 19 days; one patient remained reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positive >11 weeks from diagnosis. There were no maternal mortalities. Five pregnancies produced term live-births while 2 spontaneous miscarriages occurred at 11 and 23 weeks. RT-PCR of breast milk and maternal and neonatal samples taken at birth were negative; placenta and cord histology showed non-specific inflammation; and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific immunoglobulins were elevated in paired maternal and umbilical cord blood (n=5). CONCLUSION The majority of COVID-19 infected pregnant women had mild disease and only 2 women with risk factors (obesity, older age) had severe infection; this represents a slightly higher incidence than observed in age-matched non-pregnant women.

So far, to our knowledge, no European study has been dedicated to their heath-related quality of life (HQoL). Therefore, the primarily aim of our study was to evaluate HQoL of Polish pharmacists utilizing the SF-36 health survey with regard to anthropometric and lifestyle-related variables. METHODS A total sample screened consisted of 1412 respondents, yet 765 pharmacists (mean age 40, 86.3% females) finally participated in the study. HQoL was assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36). RESULTS The lowest median scores were noted for general health (GH, 50.0) and vitality (V, 60.0) domains. No gender differences regarding physical and mental summary scores were found. Significant difference of HQoL was found among the assessed age groups in several domains, especially physical functioning (PF) and GH (p <0.001) scores, and especially in the group of 51-60-year-old-respondents. Correlations were found between PF (r = -0.29, p <0.001), GH (r = -0.25, p <0.001) and age as well PF (r = -0.27, p <0.001), GH (r = -0.21, p <0.001) and BMI. Self-assessed dietary habits were correlated with PF (r = 0.22, p <0.001), mental health (r = 0.25, p <0.001), GH (r = 0.27, p <0.001) and V (r = 0.30, p <0.001) scores. CONCLUSIONS The analysis indicates that pharmacists tend to have similar mental and physical burden according to SF-36, with age, BMI and dietary habits as predominant factors influencing their HQoL. The study presents unique values for future comparative analyses related, for instance, to the influence of the ongoing pandemic on HQoL of health-care providers.","Kurnik-Łucka, Magdalena; Pasieka, Paweł; Górecka-Mazur, Agnieszka; Rząsa-Duran, Elżbieta; Pękala, Jakub; Gil, Krzysztof",Folia medica Cracoviensia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34185765/,43

This variety of agents is currently the cause of severe respiratory diseases (SARS-CoV2 and Influenza), Hepatitis C, measles and of high prevalence tropical diseases that are detected throughout the year (Dengue and Zika). The rs10774671 polymorphism is a base change from G to A in the last nucleotide of intron-5 of the OAS1 gene. This change modifies a splicing site and generates isoforms of the OAS1 protein with a higher molecular weight and a demonstrated lower enzymatic activity. The low activity of these OAS1 isoforms makes the innate immune response against RNA virus infections less efficient, representing a previously unattended risk factor for certain populations. OBJECTIVE Determine the distribution of rs10774671 in the open population of Mexico. METHODS In 98 healthy volunteers, allelic and genotypic frequencies were determined by qPCR using allele specific labeled probes, and the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was determined.

We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 20 index patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 and 79 of their household contacts. We determined the transmission frequency, range of manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and factors associated with infection in household settings. Of the 79 household contacts, 53 (67%) developed SARS-CoV-2 infection (49 [62%] symptomatic, 4 [5%] asymptomatic). Eight patients (10%) developed severe COVID-19, and one died of COVID-19 pneumonia (case-fatality rate: 1.9%). The probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection was similar in children and adults (55% vs. 72%, p = .14), with children being less likely to develop the symptomatic disease (46% vs. 68%, p = .06). Handwashing &#8805; 5 times/day was associated with reduced infection risk (52.8% vs. 76.9%, p = .04). SARS-CoV-2 has a high frequency of transmission among household contacts. Nonhospitalized individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection should be quarantined in patient care facilities rather than at home to minimize spread, if possible, and frequent handwashing should be practiced to prevent transmission.","Xie, Wen; Chen, Zhihai; Wang, Qi; Song, Meihua; Cao, Ying; Wang, Lin; Pan, Calvin Q",J Med Virol,,43

204985,UK Head and neck cancer surgical capacity during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic - have we learned the lessons?,2021,"Although our current knowledge of the pathophysiology of COVID-19 is still fragmentary, the information so far accrued on the tropism and life cycle of its etiological agent SARS-CoV-2, together with the emerging clinical data, suffice to indicate that the severe acute pulmonary syndrome is the main, but not the only manifestation of COVID-19. Necropsy studies are increasingly revealing underlying endothelial vasculopathies in the form of micro-haemorrhages and micro-thrombi. Intertwined with defective antiviral responses, dysregulated coagulation mechanisms, abnormal hyper-inflammatory reactions and responses, COVID-19 is disclosing a wide pathophysiological palette. An additional property in categorising the disease is the combination of tissue (e.g. neuro- and vasculo-tropism) with organ tropism, whereby the virus preferentially attacks certain organs with highly developed capillary beds, such as the lungs gastrointestinal tract, kidney and brain. These multiple clinical presentations confirm that the acute respiratory syndrome as described initially is increasingly unfolding as a more complex nosological entity, a multiorgan syndrome of systemic breadth. The neurological manifestations of COVID-19, the focus of this review, reflect this manifold nature of the disease.","Barrantes, Francisco J",Brain Behav Immun Health,,43

Comparing and benchmarking different DNN models can often be tedious due to the use of different datasets and evaluation protocols. To facilitate the process, here, we present the Speech Emotion Recognition Adaptation Benchmark (SERAB), a framework for evaluating the performance and generalization capacity of different approaches for utterance-level SER. The benchmark is composed of nine datasets for SER in six languages. Since the datasets have different sizes and numbers of emotional classes, the proposed setup is particularly suitable for estimating the generalization capacity of pre-trained DNN-based feature extractors. We used the proposed framework to evaluate a selection of standard hand-crafted feature sets and state-of-the-art DNN representations. The results highlight that using only a subset of the data included in SERAB can result in biased evaluation, while compliance with the proposed protocol can circumvent this issue.","Scheidwasser-Clow, Neil; Kegler, Mikolaj; Beckmann, Pierre; Cernak, Milos",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03414v1.pdf,43

Current data evidenced that the rate of post discharge thrombotic events in COVID-19 patients is lower compared to that observed during hospitalization. Rather than ""true thrombotic events"", these complications seem more probably ""immunothrombosis"" consequent to the recent infection. Unfortunately, the absence of data from randomized controlled trials, large prospective cohorts, and ambulatory COVID-19 patients, left unresolved the question regarding the need of post discharge thromboprophylaxis due to the absence of strong-level recommendations.","Zuin, Marco; Rigatelli, Gianluca; Zuliani, Giovanni; Roncon, Loris",QJM,,43

METHODS: This study analysed the change in influenza-positive proportion (IPP) between 2010-2019 and 2020 in countries in the Southern hemisphere with &#8804;40% missing IPP data in FluNet to assess how coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) relates to influenza activity. The analysis considered the incidence of COVID-19 reported by the World Health Organization and the implementation date of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) reported by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker. RESULTS: In each of the seven included countries, the average IPP was lower in 2020 than in 2010-2019 (P < 0.01), with the largest difference being 31.1% (95% confidence interval 28.4-33.7%). In Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and South Africa, higher IPPs were observed during epidemiological weeks 4-16 in 2020 compared with the same weeks in 2010-2019. The IPP increased after NPIs were implemented in Argentina and South Africa, but started to decline in Bolivia, Chile, Madagascar and Paraguay before NPI implementation. CONCLUSIONS: Influenza burden and activity decreased in 2020 in the Southern hemisphere. The temporal decline in influenza activity varied between countries.","Kim, Jeehyun; Gómez Gómez, Raquel Elizabeth; Hong, Kwan; Yum, Sujin; Jang, Jieun; Chun, Byung Chul",Int J Infect Dis,,43
218789,"Covid-19 pandemic and head and neck cancers, what should we expect?",2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic effects daily dental work. Therefore, infection control measures are necessary to prevent infection of dental personnel during dental treatments. The use of a preprocedural mouth rinse with chlorhexidine (CHX), cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC), or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) solution for 30-60 s may reduce the viral load and may protect the personnel in a dental practice. In the present study the virucidal effect of the mouth rinsing solutions ViruProX® with 0.05% CPC and 1.5% H2O2 and BacterX® pro containing 0.1% CHX, 0.05% CPC, and 0.005% sodium fluoride (F-) was investigated in vitro. The mouth rinsing solutions successfully inactivated infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), within 30 s. To determine the effective components, CHX, CPC, H2O2, and a combination of CHX and CPC, were tested against SARS-CoV-2 in addition. While a combination of CPC and CHX as well as CPC alone led to a significant reduction of infectious viral particles, H2O2 and CHX alone had no virucidal effect against SARS-CoV-2. It can be assumed that preprocedural rinsing of the mouth with ViruProX® or BacterX® pro will reduce the viral load in the oral cavity and could thus lower the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in dental practice.","Koch-Heier, Julia; Hoffmann, Helen; Schindler, Michael; Lussi, Adrian; Planz, Oliver",,,43
219583,Optimum early orthopaedic surgery in COVID-19 patients,2021,"OBJECTIVES: To develop an international consensus on managing penile cancer patients during the COVID-19 acute waves. A major concern for patients with penile cancer during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is how the enforced safety measures will affect their disease management. Delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation may have an impact on the extent of the primary lesion as well as the cancer-specific survival because of the development and progression of inguinal lymph node metastases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review of the COVID-19 literature was conducted in conjunction with analysis of current international guidelines on the management of penile cancer. Results were presented to an international panel of experts on penile cancer and infection control by a virtual accelerated Delphi process using 4 survey rounds. Consensus opinion was defined as an agreement of &#8805;80%, which was used to reconfigure management pathways for penile cancer. RESULTS: Limited evidence is available for delaying penile cancer management. The consensus rate of agreement was 100% that penile cancer pathways should be reconfigured, and measures should be developed to prevent perioperative nosocomial transmission of COVID-19. The panel also reached a consensus on several statements aimed at reconfiguring the management of penile cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Senior medical students were identified as potential workers and many worldwide graduated early to serve as Junior Physicians in hospitals. The authors sought to identify factors that informed the decision to work, describe experiences in this capacity, and elucidate benefits for trainees. METHODS: The investigators conducted a mixed-methods observational cohort study of early medical graduates eligible to work as Junior Physicians at two New York medical centers in April/May 2020 during an initial surge in COVID-19 hospitalizations. Graduates were surveyed, and a sample of Junior Physicians participated in a focus group. Survey responses of those who worked were compared to those who did not. Focus group responses were transcribed, coded, and thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Fifty-nine graduates completed the study methods and 39 worked as Junior Physicians. Primary reasons for working included duty to help (39 [100%]), financial incentive (32 [82%]), desire to learn about pandemic response (25 [64%]), and educational incentive (24 [62%]). All had direct contact with COVID-19 patients, believed working was beneficial to their medical training, and were glad they worked. None contracted a symptomatic infection while working. Compared with non-Junior Physicians, Junior Physicians reported increased comfort levels in completing medical intern-level actions like transitions of care functions, such as writing transfer notes (P < 0.01), writing discharge orders (P = 0.01), and providing verbal sign out (P = 0.05), and they reported more comfort in managing COVID-19 patients. Sixteen themes emerged from the focus group and were placed into four categories: development of skills, patient care, safety, and wellness. CONCLUSIONS: Senior medical students chose to work as Junior Physicians for both personal and educational reasons. Experiences were beneficial to trainees and can inform future innovations in medical education.","Pravder, Harrison D; Langdon-Embry, Liana; Hernandez, Rafael J; Berbari, Nicholas; Shelov, Steven P; Kinzler, Wendy L",BMC Med Educ,,43

240909,Rapid training of non-intensivists using an online critical care course during COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly altered management of surgical patients globally. International guidelines recommended that non-operative management be implemented wherever possible (e.g. in proven uncomplicated appendicitis) to reduce pressure on healthcare services and reduce risk of peri-operative viral transmission. We sought to compare our management and outcomes of appendicitis during lockdown vs a non-pandemic period. METHODS: All presentations to our department with a clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis between 12/03/2020 and 30/06/2020 were compared to the same 110-day period in 2019. Quantity and severity of presentations, use of radiological investigations, rate of operative intervention and histopathological findings were variables collected for comparison. RESULTS: There was a reduction in appendicitis presentations (from 74 to 56 cases), and an increase in radiological imaging (from 70.27% to 89.29%) (P = 0.007) from 2019 to 2020. In 2019, 93.24% of patients had appendicectomy, compared to 71.42% in 2020(P < 0.001). This decrease was most pronounced in uncomplicated cases, whose operative rates dropped from 90.32% to 62.5% (P = 0.009). Post-operative histology confirmed appendicitis in 73.9% in 2019, compared to 97.5% in 2020 (P = 0.001). Normal appendiceal pathology was reported for 17 cases (24.64%) in 2019, compared to none in 2020 (P < 0.001) - a 0% negative appendicectomy rate (NAR). DISCUSSION: The 0% NAR in 2020 is due to a combination of increased CT imaging, a higher threshold to operate, and is impacted by increased disease severity due to delayed patient presentation. This study adds to growing literature promoting routine use of radiological imaging to confirm appendicitis diagnosis. As we enter a second lockdown, patients should be encouraged to avoid late presentations, and surgical departments should continue using radiological imaging more liberally in guiding appendicitis management.","Somers, Kate; Abd Elwahab, Sami; Raza, Muhammad Zeeshan; O039,; Grady, Sorcha; DeMarchi, Joshua; Butt, Abeeda; Burke, John; Robb, William; Power, Colm; McCawley, Niamh; McNamara, Deborah; Kearney, David; Hill, Arnold D K",Surg.

ARI-related symptoms declined following campus closure and implementation of stay-at-home orders, demonstrating the impact of population-based physical distancing measures on control of a broad range of respiratory infections.","Adenaiye, Oluwasanmi; Bueno de Mesquita, Paul Jacob; Wu, Qiong; Hong, Filbert; Lai, Jianyu; Chen, Shuo; Milton, Donald K",Influenza Other Respir Viruses,,43
275182,COVID-19 and the Return to Head and Neck Outpatient Activity in The United Kingdom: What Is the New Normal?,2021,"The most prominent strand of moral thought in the African philosophical tradition is relational and cohesive, roughly demanding that we enter into community with each other. Familiar is the view that being a real person means sharing a way of life with others, perhaps even in their fate. What does such a communal ethic prescribe for the coronavirus pandemic? Might it forbid one from social distancing, at least away from intimates? Or would it entail that social distancing is wrong to some degree, although morally permissible on balance? Or could it mean that social distancing is not wrong to any degree and could, under certain circumstances, be the right way to commune? In this article, I defend the latter view. I argue that, given an independently attractive understanding of how to value communal relationship, distancing oneself from others when necessary to protect them from serious incapacitation or harm can come at no cost to right action. However, I also discuss cases in which social distancing would evince a lack of good character, despite being the right thing to do.","Metz, Thaddeus",,,43

The impact of this coronavirus disease 2019 on the endocrine glands remains unknown. However, the results of previous studies on viruses from the same family allow us to write proposals for patients followed for chronic endocrine diseases. Currently, if these subjects are infected with SARS-CoV-2, they must not stop their treatment. In some cases, hormone replacement doses have to be increased. In case of worsening clinical signs, hormonal biological monitoring must be done. This article will be helpful for improving the management of chronic endocrine diseases that could affect thyroid, adrenals, gonads and pituitary gland functions. Proposals could be applied in COVID-19 infected subjects or in those who have been in contact with COVID-19 infected people.","Velayoudom, Fritz-Line; Alwis Wijewickrama, Piyumi Sachindra; Ranathunga, H Ishara; Somasundaram, Noel",J Pak Med Assoc,,43

297537,Head and neck surgical oncology in the time of a pandemic: Subsite-specific triage guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Individuals with cancer, particularly those who are receiving systemic anticancer treatments, have been postulated to be at increased risk of mortality from COVID-19. This conjecture has considerable effect on the treatment of patients with cancer and data from large, multicentre studies to support this assumption are scarce because of the contingencies of the pandemic. We aimed to describe the clinical and demographic characteristics and COVID-19 outcomes in patients with cancer. METHODS: In this prospective observational study, all patients with active cancer and presenting to our network of cancer centres were eligible for enrolment into the UK Coronavirus Cancer Monitoring Project (UKCCMP). The UKCCMP is the first COVID-19 clinical registry that enables near real-time reports to frontline doctors about the effects of COVID-19 on patients with cancer. Eligible patients tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 on RT-PCR assay from a nose or throat swab. We excluded patients with a radiological or clinical diagnosis of COVID-19, without a positive RT-PCR test. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality, or discharge from hospital, as assessed by the reporting sites during the patient hospital admission. FINDINGS: From March 18, to April 26, 2020, we analysed 800 patients with a diagnosis of cancer and symptomatic COVID-19. 412 (52%) patients had a mild COVID-19 disease course. 226 (28%) patients died and risk of death was significantly associated with advancing patient age (odds ratio 9·42 [95% CI 6·56-10·02]; p<0·0001), being male (1·67 [1·19-2·34]; p=0·003), and the presence of other comorbidities such as hypertension (1·95 [1·36-2·80]; p<0·001) and cardiovascular disease (2·32 [1·47-3·64]). 281 (35%) patients had received cytotoxic chemotherapy within 4 weeks before testing positive for COVID-19. After adjusting for age, gender, and comorbidities, chemotherapy in the past 4 weeks had no significant effect on mortality from COVID-19 disease, when compared with patients with cancer who had not received recent chemotherapy (1·18 [0·81-1·72]; p=0·380). We found no significant effect on mortality for patients with immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, targeted therapy, radiotherapy use within the past 4 weeks. INTERPRETATION: Mortality from COVID-19 in cancer patients appears to be principally driven by age, gender, and comorbidities. We are not able to identify evidence that cancer patients on cytotoxic chemotherapy or other anticancer treatment are at an increased risk of mortality from COVID-19 disease compared with those not on active treatment.

To capture these parameters, survey sample sizes may need to be very large, especially when the overall infection rate is still low. Therefore, we propose the use of ""snowball sampling"" to enrich serological surveys by testing contacts of infected individuals identified in the early stages of an outbreak. For future emerging pandemics, this observational study sampling design can answer many key questions, such as estimating the asymptomatic proportion of all infected cases, the probability of a given clinical presentation for a seropositive individual, or the association between characteristics of either the host or the infection and seropositivity among contacts of index individuals. We provide examples, in the context of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, of studies and analysis methods using a snowball sample and perform a simulation study that demonstrates scenarios where snowball sampling can answer these questions more efficiently than other sampling schemes. We hope such study designs can be applied to provide valuable information to slow the present pandemic as it enters its next stage and in early stages of future pandemics.","Kennedy-Shaffer, Lee; Qiu, Xueting; Hanage, William P",Am. j. epidemiol,,43

This study compared three clinical recommendations (dilution, rinsing and wiping) on plaque pH after formula consumption. METHODS: Eighteen subjects were recruited. The five interventions with 2-week washout between visits included: Rinse with undiluted formula for 30 s (UF); rinse with 50% diluted formula for 30 s (DF); rinse with undiluted formula for 30 s, followed by rinsing with water for 1 minute (UF/R); rinse with undiluted formula for 30 s, followed by wiping (UF/W); rinse with 10% sucrose for 30 s as control (C). Plaque samples were collected at baseline, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 30 min after the intervention and pH measured using the plaque sampling method. RESULTS: UF/R resulted in significantly smaller pH drops at 5, 10 and 20 min compared to UF. It also resulted in higher minimum pH (UF/R: 6.34 ± 0.36 Vs UF: 6.06 ± 0.40, p = 0.02), smaller maximum pH drop (UF/R: 0.63 ± 0.35 Vs UF: 0.90 ± 0.49, p = 0.03), smaller sum of change of hydrogen ion concentration (UF/R: 9.22 × 10-7 ± 7.8 × 10-7 Vs UF: 2.30 × 10-6 ± 2.6 × 10-6, p = 0.04), and smaller area under the curve (UF/R: 7.70 ± 5.44 Vs UF: 13.44 ± 9.44, p = 0.02). DF and UF/W did not result in any significant pH change compared to UF. CONCLUSIONS: Of the three clinical recommendations, only rinsing with water for 1 min after undiluted formula reduced plaque acidogenicity. Teeth wiping with a moist cloth and 50% dilution of infant formula did not have an effect on plaque acidity.","Koh, S G S; Sim, Y F; Sim, C J; Hu, S; Hong, C H L; Duggal, M S",Eur. Arch. Paediatr.

Due to the importance of issue and the lack of general statistics on these disorders among the Hospital staff treating the COVID-19 patients, this study aims to systematically review and determine the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression within front-line healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients. METHODS: In this research work, the systematic review, meta-analysis and meta-regression approaches are used to approximate the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression within front-line healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients. The keywords of prevalence, anxiety, stress, depression, psychopathy, mental illness, mental disorder, doctor, physician, nurse, hospital staff, 2019-nCoV, COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 and Coronaviruses were used for searching the SID, MagIran, IranMedex, IranDoc, ScienceDirect, Embase, Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science (ISI) and Google Scholar databases. The search process was conducted in December 2019 to June 2020. In order to amalgamate and analyze the reported results within the collected studies, the random effects model is used. The heterogeneity of the studies is assessed using the I2 index. Lastly, the data analysis is performed within the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. RESULTS: Of the 29 studies with a total sample size of 22,380, 21 papers have reported the prevalence of depression, 23 have reported the prevalence of anxiety, and 9 studies have reported the prevalence of stress. The prevalence of depression is 24.3% (18% CI 18.2-31.6%), the prevalence of anxiety is 25.8% (95% CI 20.5-31.9%), and the prevalence of stress is 45% (95% CI 24.3-67.5%) among the hospitals' Hospital staff caring for the COVID-19 patients. According to the results of meta-regression analysis, with increasing the sample size, the prevalence of depression and anxiety decreased, and this was statistically significant (P < 0.05), however, the prevalence of stress increased with increasing the sample size, yet this was not statistically significant (P = 0.829). CONCLUSION: The results of this study clearly demonstrate that the prevalence of stress, anxiety and depression within front-line healthcare workers caring for COVID-19 patients is high. Therefore, the health policy-makers should take measures to control and prevent mental disorders in the Hospital staff.","Salari, Nader; Khazaie, Habibolah; Hosseinian-Far, Amin; Khaledi-Paveh, Behnam; Kazeminia, Mohsen; Mohammadi, Masoud; Shohaimi, Shamarina; Daneshkhah, Alireza; Eskandari, Soudabeh",Hum Resour Health,,43
324848,Changing practice patterns in head and neck oncologic surgery in the early COVID-19 era,2020,"Ivermectin is an antiparasitic drug that some have claimed is an effective treatment for reducing Covid-19 deaths. To test this claim, two recent peer reviewed papers both conducted a meta-analysis on a similar set of randomized controlled trials data, applying the same classical statistical approach. Although the statistical results were similar, one of the papers (Bryant et al, 2021) concluded that ivermectin was effective for reducing Covid-19 deaths, while the other (Roman et al, 2021) concluded that there was insufficient quality of evidence to support the conclusion Ivermectin was effective. This paper applies a Bayesian approach, to a subset of the same trial data, to test several causal hypotheses linking Covid-19 severity and ivermectin to mortality and produce an alternative analysis to the classical approach. Applying diverse alternative analysis methods which reach the same conclusions should increase overall confidence in the result. We show that there is strong evidence to support a causal link between ivermectin, Covid-19 severity and mortality, and: i) for severe Covid-19 there is a 90.7% probability the risk ratio favours ivermectin; ii) for mild/moderate Covid-19 there is an 84.1% probability the risk ratio favours ivermectin. To address concerns expressed about the veracity of some of the studies we evaluate the sensitivity of the conclusions to any single study by removing one study at a time. In the worst case, where (Elgazzar 2020) is removed, the results remain robust, for both severe and mild to moderate Covid-19. The paper also highlights advantages of using Bayesian methods over classical statistical methods for meta-analysis. All studies included in the analysis were prior to data on the delta variant.","Neil, Martin; Fenton, Norman",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.13739v2.pdf,43

We aimed to provide an alternative to laboratory tests and to assess the value of home testing as part of our regular services going forward. METHODS: Home test kits as well as accompanying user instructions were made available to our patients with paediatric IBD that required faecal calprotectin test between 17 April and 12 August 2020. Once the user completed the test, results were automatically uploaded to the result portal and clinical staff were alerted. A user feedback questionnaire was sent to users that had completed the home test. RESULTS: Of the 54 patients, 41 (76%) aged between 4.7 and 18.1 years used the home test. A total of 45 home tests were done, one of which produced an invalid result. The decision to modify management was made in 12 (29%) of the patients, while 14 (34%) had no changes made and 15 (37%) required further assessment. Twenty (48.8%) responded to the questionnaire and 85% stated that they preferred the home test to the laboratory testing method. CONCLUSIONS: Home calprotectin tests were useful in guiding clinical management during a time when laboratory testing was less available. They may offer benefits as part of routine paediatric IBD monitoring to help target appointments and reduce unnecessary hospital attendances in the future.","Jere, Mwansa; Garrick, Vikki; Curtis, Lee; Tayler, Rachel; Gervais, Lisa; Gerasimidis, Konstantinos; Hansen, Richard",,,43
326625,Behavioural changes during the COVID-19 pandemic: Results of a nationwide survey in Singapore,2021,"Micro-mobility ride-sharing is an emerging technology that provides access to the transit system with minimum environmental impacts. Significant research is required to ensure that micro-mobility ride-sharing provides a better fulfilment of user needs. In this study, we propose a novel business model for the micro-mobility ride-sharing system where light vehicles such as electric scooters and electric bikes are crowdsourced. This new model consists of three entities, the suppliers, the customers, and a management party, which is responsible for receiving, renting, booking, and demand matching with offered resources. The proposed model has the potential to allow the suppliers to define the location of their private e-scooter/e-bike and the period of time they are available for rent, match it with a particular demand, and then offer suppliers the opportunity to get their e-scooters/e-bikes rented and returned at the end of the renting period to the same (nearby) location. The management party will need to match the e-scooter/e-bike to a series of renting demands with the last demand as a destination very close to the initial location of the e-scooter/e-bike at the start of the renting period. One potential advantage of the proposed model is that it shifts the charging and maintenance efforts to a crowd of suppliers.","Elhenawy, Mohammed; Komol, MD Mostafizur Rahman; Ashqar, Huthaifa I.; Almannaa, Mohammed Hamad; Masoud, Mahmoud; Rakha, Hesham A.; Rakotonirainy, Andry",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.15585v1.pdf,43
328596,Advanced head and neck surgery training during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"In the study of infectious diseases on networks, researchers calculate epidemic thresholds to help forecast whether a disease will eventually infect a large fraction of a population. Because network structure typically changes in time, which fundamentally influences the dynamics of spreading processes on them and in turn affects epidemic thresholds for disease propagation, it is important to examine epidemic thresholds in temporal networks. Most existing studies of epidemic thresholds in temporal networks have focused on models in discrete time, but most real-world networked systems evolve continuously in time. In our work, we encode the continuous time-dependence of networks into the evaluation of the epidemic threshold of a susceptible--infected--susceptible (SIS) process by studying an SIS model on tie-decay networks. We derive the epidemic-threshold condition of this model, and we perform numerical experiments to verify it. We also examine how different factors---the decay coefficients of the tie strengths in a network, the frequency of interactions between nodes, and the sparsity of the underlying social network in which interactions occur---lead to decreases or increases of the critical values of the threshold and hence contribute to facilitating or impeding the spread of a disease. We thereby demonstrate how the features of tie-decay networks alter the outcome of disease spread.","Chen, Qinyi; Porter, Mason A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.12932v2.pdf,43
328607,COVID-19 pandemic: Effects and evidence-based recommendations for otolaryngology and head and neck surgery practice,2020,"BACKGROUND: Toxic metabolic encephalopathy (TME) has been reported in 7-31% of hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, some reports include sedation-related delirium and few data exist on the etiology of TME. We aimed to identify the prevalence, etiologies, and mortality rates associated with TME in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-positive patients. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, multicenter, observational cohort study among patients with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection hospitalized at four New York City hospitals in the same health network between March 1, 2020, and May 20, 2020. TME was diagnosed in patients with altered mental status off sedation or after an adequate sedation washout. Patients with structural brain disease, seizures, or primary neurological diagnoses were excluded. The coprimary outcomes were the prevalence of TME stratified by etiology and in-hospital mortality (excluding comfort care only patients) assessed by using a multivariable time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models with adjustment for age, race, sex, intubation, intensive care unit requirement, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, hospital location, and date of admission. RESULTS: Among 4491 patients with COVID-19, 559 (12%) were diagnosed with TME, of whom 435 of 559 (78%) developed encephalopathy immediately prior to hospital admission. The most common etiologies were septic encephalopathy (n = 247 of 559 [62%]), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) (n = 331 of 559 [59%]), and uremia (n = 156 of 559 [28%]). Multiple etiologies were present in 435 (78%) patients. Compared with those without TME (n = 3932), patients with TME were older (76 vs. 62 years), had dementia (27% vs. 3%) or psychiatric history (20% vs. 10%), were more often intubated (37% vs. 20%), had a longer hospital length of stay (7.9 vs. 6.0 days), and were less often discharged home (25% vs. 66% [all P < 0.001]). Excluding comfort care patients (n = 267 of 4491 [6%]) and after adjustment for confounders, TME remained associated with increased risk of in-hospital death (n = 128 of 425 [30%] patients with TME died, compared with n = 600 of 3799 [16%] patients without TME; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.52, P = 0.031), and TME due to hypoxemia conferred the highest risk (n = 97 of 233 [42%] patients with HIE died, compared with n = 631 of 3991 [16%] patients without HIE; aHR 1.56, 95% CI 1.21-2.00, P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: TME occurred in one in eight hospitalized patients with COVID-19, was typically multifactorial, and was most often due to hypoxemia, sepsis, and uremia. After we adjustment for confounding factors, TME was associated with a 24% increased risk of in-hospital mortality.","Frontera, Jennifer A; Melmed, Kara; Fang, Taolin; Granger, Andre; Lin, Jessica; Yaghi, Shadi; Zhou, Ting; Lewis, Ariane; Kurz, Sebastian; Kahn, D Ethan; de Havenon, Adam; Huang, Joshua; Czeisler, Barry M; Lord, Aaron; Meropol, Sharon B; Troxel, Andrea B; Wisniewski, Thomas; Balcer, Laura; Galetta, Steven",Neurocritical care,,43

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to spread through the global population causing widespread morbidity, mortality, and socioeconomic chaos. Using SARS-CoV-2 as our model and starting with a gBlocks encoded nucleocapsid (N) gene, we purified recombinant protein from E. coli, to serve as bait for selecting semisynthetic nanobodies from our Nomad single-pot library. Clones were isolated in days and first fused to Gaussia luciferase to determine EC50 in the tens of nM range, and second fused to the ascorbate peroxidase derivative APEX2 for sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. To generate inherently fluorescent immunoreagents, we introduce novel periplasmic sdAb fusions made with mNeonGreen and mScarlet-I, which were produced at milligram amounts. The fluorescent fusion proteins enabled concise visualization of SARS-CoV-2 N in the cytoplasm but not in the nucleus 24 h post infection, akin to the distribution of SARS-CoV N, thereby validating these useful imaging tools. SdAb reactivity appeared specific to SARS-CoV-2 with very much weaker binding to SARS-CoV, and no noticeable cross-reactivity to a panel of overexpressed human codon optimized N proteins from other CoV. High periplasmic expression levels and in silico immortalization of the nanobody constructs guarantees a cost-effective and reliable source of SARS-CoV-2 immunoreagents. Our proof-of-principle study should be applicable to known and newly emerging CoV to broaden the tools available for their analysis and help safeguard human health in a more proactive than reactive manner.","Sherwood, Laura Jo; Hayhurst, Andrew",ACS Synth Biol,,43

336144,COVID-19 and Children: Many Questions Yet To Be Answered,2020,"BACKGROUND: In stable ischaemic heart disease (SIHD), measurement of fractional flow reserve (FFR) to guide selection of lesions for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) reduces death and myocardial infarction (MI) compared with angiographic guidance. However, it is unknown if the improved outcomes are due to avoidance of stenting of physiologically insignificant lesions or are a by-product of placing fewer stents. METHODS: We developed a Monte Carlo simulation using the PCI strata of the Bypass Angioplasty Revascularization Investigation 2 Diabetes study to investigate how random deferral of PCI impacts outcomes. To simulate deferral, a randomly selected group of patients randomised to PCI were removed and replaced by an equal number of randomly selected patients randomised to intensive medical therapy (IMT) using a random number generator in Python's NumPy module. The primary endpoint was the rate of death or non-fatal MI at 1 year. RESULTS: Death/MI at 1 year occurred in 8.3% of 798 patients in the PCI group and 5.1% of 807 patients in the IMT control group (p=0.02). Following 10 000 iterations of random replacement of 10%, 20%, 30% or 40% of PCI patients with randomly selected IMT patients, the rate of death/MI at 1 year progressively declined from 8.3% to 8.0%, 7.6%, 7.3% and 7.0%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In this simulation model, random deferral of PCI procedures in SIHD progressively reduced death/MI as the percentage of procedures deferred increases. FFR-guided deferral of PCI may improve outcomes as a result of placing fewer stents and be unrelated to the haemodynamic severity of lesions.","Williams, Conor; Brown, David L",Heart,,43

To address this gap, we developed remote tools and techniques to support screen reader users in learning web development. In this paper, we describe our design and implementation of a free, remote web development workshop, designed to introduce 12 screen reader users to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We taught the workshop remotely using synchronous lectures followed by 1-on-1 time with teaching assistants (TAs), and included a resource-rich website, tactile diagrams, and discussion forum. We evaluated the impact of the workshop, as well as techniques and tools using pre- and post-workshop surveys, observational field notes, exit interviews, and unit quizzes. At the end of the workshop, all students demonstrated their knowledge of web development basics by creating and publishing their own websites;showed an increase in self-efficacy;and maintained a high level of interest in the subject. Participating in this workshop benefited our TAs who reported increased confidence in understanding accessibility concepts, increased interest in pursuing work related to accessibility, and plans to apply what they learned. Based on these findings, we recommend techniques and tools to support remote screen reader users learning web development;and suggestions for engaging with post-secondary institutions to pair service learning with tech skills training.

352856,Highlights from this issue,2020,"It is impossible to predict or comprehend the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The UK Government's advice for vulnerable people, including older adults, to move towards self-isolation and social distancing is likely to reduce rates of transmission, the risk of severe illness and the impact on the acute health services. Although justified and necessary, this process of isolation is likely to have a negative impact on the mental health of these vulnerable groups, especially older people. It will become increasingly important for community health professionals to assess subtle changes in older persons' mental health, as the duration of this period of isolation remains unclear. The biopsychopharmacosocial model provides one method of assessing mental health and planning health and social care needs. This article hopes to guide community health professionals through the specifics of this assessment model in relation to the growing COVID-19 pandemic.","Baker, Edward; Clark, Louise L",Br J Community Nurs,,43

359898,Recurrence of COVID-19 documented with RT-PCR,2021,"BACKGROUND At the end of 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak began in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and spread rapidly to the whole country within 1 month. This new epidemic caused a great mental reaction among the public. This study aimed to assess and compare the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety and depression among the public affected by quarantine and those unaffected during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb. 2020. MATERIAL AND METHODS Data were collected using the self-rating anxiety scale (SAS) and the self-rating depression scale (SDS) administered to 1593 respondents aged 18 years and above. The respondents were grouped as 'affected group' and 'unaffected group' on the basis of whether they or their families/colleagues/classmates/neighbors had been quarantined. RESULTS Among 1593 participants, the prevalence of anxiety and depression was approximately 8.3% and 14.6%, respectively, and the prevalence in the affected group (12.9%, 22.4%) was significantly higher than that in the unaffected group (6.7%, 11.9%). Lower average household income, lower education level, having a higher self-evaluated level of knowledge, being more worried about being infected, having no psychological support, greater property damage, and lower self-perceived health condition were significant associated with higher scores on the SAS and SDS. People living in Chongqing had higher SAS and SDS scores than those living in Yunnan Province. CONCLUSIONS The prevalence of anxiety and depression of the affected group are higher than in the unaffected group during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb. 2020. The government should focus more on providing economic and medical support to improve the general population's mental state.","Lei, Lei; Huang, Xiaoming; Zhang, Shuai; Yang, Jinrong; Yang, Lin; Xu, Min",Med Sci Monit,,43

371133,Highlight from this issue,2021,"Interleukin 13 (IL-13) is an immunoregulatory cytokine that is primarily released by activated T-helper 2 cells. It induces the pathogenesis of many allergic diseases, such as airway hyperresponsiveness, glycoprotein hypersecretion and goblet cell hyperplasia. IL-13 also inhibits tumor immunosurveillance, which leads to carcinogenesis. In recent studies, elevated IL-13 serum levels have been shown in severe COVID-19 patients. Thus it is important to predict IL-13 inducing peptides or regions in a protein for designing safe protein therapeutics particularly immunotherapeutic. This paper describes a method developed for predicting, designing and scanning IL-13 inducing peptides. The dataset used in this study contain experimentally validated 313 IL-13 inducing peptides and 2908 non-inducing homo-sapiens peptides extracted from the immune epitope database (IEDB). We have extracted 95 key features using SVC-L1 technique from the originally generated 9165 features using Pfeature. Further, these key features were ranked based on their prediction ability, and top 10 features were used for building machine learning prediction models. In this study, we have deployed various machine learning techniques to develop models for predicting IL-13 inducing peptides. These models were trained, test and evaluated using five-fold cross-validation techniques; best model were evaluated on independent dataset. Our best model based on XGBoost achieves a maximum AUC of 0.83 and 0.80 on the training and independent dataset, respectively. Our analysis indicate that certain SARS-COV2 variants are more prone to induce IL-13 in COVID-19 patients. A standalone package as well as a web server named IL-13Pred has been developed for predicting IL-13 inducing peptides (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/il13pred/).

METHODS: Outbreak data from Colorado, USA (2020), alongside data on implemented public health measures were analyzed. RESULTS: There were three waves (n = 3169 outbreaks; 61 650 individuals). The first was led by healthcare settings, the second leisure/entertainment and the third workplaces followed by other settings where the trajectory was equally distributed amongst essential workplaces, non-essential workplaces, schools and non-essential healthcare.Non-acute healthcare, essential and non-essential workplace experienced more outbreaks compared to education, entertainment, large-group-living and social gatherings.Schools experienced 11% of identified outbreaks, yet involved just 4% of total cases. Conversely, adult-education outbreaks (2%) had disproportionately more cases (9%). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest schools were not the key driver of the latest wave in infections. School re-opening coinciding with returning to work may have accounted for the parallel rise in outbreaks in those settings suggesting contact-points outside school being more likely to seed in-school outbreaks than contact points within school as the wave of outbreaks in all other settings occurred either prior to or simultaneously with the schools wave.School re-opening is a priority but requires mitigation measures to do so safely including staggering opening of different settings whilst maintaining low levels of community transmission.","Lakha, F; King, A; Swinkels, K; Lee, A C K",J. public health (Oxf),,43

Our context is an effort to inform policy regarding social behavior, to mitigate strain on hospital capacity. The model unknowns are taken to be: the time-varying transmission rate, the fraction of exposed cases that require hospitalization, and the time-varying detection probabilities of new asymptomatic and symptomatic cases. In simulations, we obtain accurate estimates of undetected (that is, unmeasured) infectious populations, by measuring the detected cases together with the recovered and dead - and without assumed knowledge of the detection rates. These state estimates require a measurement of the recovered population, and are tolerant to low errors in that measurement. Further, excellent estimates of all quantities are obtained using a temporal baseline of 112 days, with the exception of the time-varying transmission rate at times prior to the implementation of social distancing. The estimation of this transmission rate is sensitive to contamination in the data, highlighting the need for accurate and uniform methods of reporting. Finally, we employ the procedure using real data from Italy reported by Johns Hopkins. The aim of this paper is not to assign extreme significance to the results of these specific experiments \textit{per se}. Rather, we intend to exemplify the power of SDA to determine what properties of measurements will yield estimates of unknown model parameters to a desired precision - all set within the complex context of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Armstrong, Eve; Runge, Manuela; Gerardin, Jaline",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.12441v1.pdf,43

412174,Head and Neck Surgery Residency during Covid-19 Pandemic. Lessons from Southern Italy,2020,"Samples of groundwater were collected during a post-monsoon period (January) and a pre-monsoon period (May) in 2020 from 30 locations in the rapidly developing industrial and residential area of the Coimbatore region in southern India. These sampling periods coincided with times before and during the lockdown in industrial activity and reduced agricultural activity that occurred in the region due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This provided a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of reduced anthropogenic activity on groundwater quality. Approximately 17% of the wells affected by high fluoride concentrations in the post-monsoon period returned to levels suitable for human consumption in samples collected in the pre-monsoon period. This was probably due to ion exchange processes, infiltration of rainwater during the seasonal monsoon that diluted concentrations of ions including geogenic fluoride, as well as a reduction in anthropogenic inputs during the lockdown. The total hazard index for fluoride in the post-monsoon samples calculated for children, adult women, and adult men indicated that 73%, 60%, and 50% of the groundwater samples, respectively, had fluoride levels higher than the permissible limit. In this study, nitrate pollution declined by 33.4% by the pre-monsoon period relative to the post-monsoon period. The chemical facies of groundwater reverted from the Na-HCO3-Cl and Na-Cl to the Ca-HCO3 type in pre-monsoon samples. Various geogenic indicators like molar ratios, inter-ionic relations along with graphical tools demonstrated that plagioclase mineral weathering, carbonate dissolution, reverse ion exchange, and anthropogenic inputs are influencing the groundwater chemistry of this region. These findings were further supported by the saturation index assessed for the post- and pre-monsoon samples. COVID-19 lockdown considerably reduced groundwater pollution by Na+, K+, Cl-, NO3¯, and F- ions due to shutdown of industries and reduced agricultural activities. Further groundwater quality improvement during lockdown period there is evidence that the COVID-19 lockdown by increased HCO3¯ ion concentration. Overall results illustrate the positive benefits to groundwater quality that could occur as a result of measures to control anthropogenic inputs of pollutants.","Karunanidhi, D; Aravinthasamy, P; Deepali, M; Subramani, T; Shankar, K",Arch Environ Contam Toxicol,,43
414285,Living with COVID-19: The road ahead,2021,"Global COVID-19 pandemic is caused by infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Continuous emergence of new variants and their rapid spread are jeopardizing vaccine countermeasures to a significant extent. While currently available vaccines are effective at preventing illness associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, these have been shown to be less effective at preventing breakthrough infection and transmission from a vaccinated individual to others. Here we demonstrate broad antiviral activity of cysteamine HCl in vitro against variants of SARS-CoV-2 assayed in a highly permissible Vero cell line. Cysteamine HCl inhibited infection of alpha, beta, gamma and delta variants effectively and the inhibitory activity was shown to manifest during the early stages of viral infection. Cysteamine is a very well-tolerated US FDA-approved drug used chronically as a topical ophthalmic solution to treat ocular cystinosis in patients who receive it hourly or QID lifelong at concentrations 3 to 4 times higher than that required to inhibit SARS CoV-2 in tissue culture. Application of cysteamine as a topical nasal treatment can potentially : 1) mitigate existing infection 2) prevent infection in exposed individuals, and 3) limit the contagion in vulnerable populations..","Thoene, Jess G; Gavin, Robert F; Towne, Aaron; Wattay, Lauren; Ferrari, Maria Grazia; Pal, Ranajit",,,43
416157,Olfactory and Gustatory Dysfunction in COVID-19 Patients from Northern India: A Cross-Sectional Observational Study,2021,"How amphipathic phospholipids are shuttled between the membrane bilayer remains an essential but elusive process, particularly at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). One prominent phospholipid shuttling process concerns the biogenesis of APOB-containing lipoproteins within the ER lumen, which may require bulk trans-bilayer movement of phospholipids from the cytoplasmic leaflet of the ER bilayer. Here, we show that TMEM41B, present in the lipoprotein export machinery, encodes a previously conceptualized ER lipid scramblase mediating trans-bilayer shuttling of bulk phospholipids. Loss of hepatic TMEM41B eliminates plasma lipids, due to complete absence of mature lipoproteins within the ER, but paradoxically also activates lipid production. Mechanistically, scramblase deficiency triggers unique ER morphological changes and unsuppressed activation of SREBPs, which potently promotes lipid synthesis despite stalled secretion. Together, this response induces full-blown nonalcoholic hepatosteatosis in the TMEM41B-deficient mice within weeks. Collectively, our data uncovered a fundamental mechanism safe-guarding ER function and integrity, dysfunction of which disrupts lipid homeostasis.","Huang, Dong; Xu, Bolin; Liu, Lu; Wu, Lingzhi; Zhu, Yuangang; Ghanbarpour, Alireza; Wang, Yawei; Chen, Feng-Jung; Lyu, Jia; Hu, Yating; Kang, Yunlu; Zhou, Wenjing; Wang, Xiao; Ding, Wanqiu; Li, Xin; Jiang, Zhaodi; Chen, Jizheng; Zhang, Xu; Zhou, Hongwen; Li, John Zhong; Guo, Chunguang; Zheng, Wen; Zhang, Xiuqin; Li, Peng; Melia, Thomas; Reinisch, Karin; Chen, Xiao-Wei",Cell metab,,43

427478,Reverse-surge planning during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cautionary ramp-up for the otolaryngologist. (Special section on COVID-19.),2020,"""COVID-19"" is the word that certainly isn't forgotten by everybody who lives in the first half of the twenty-first century. COVID-19, as a pandemic, has led many researchers from different biomedical fields to find solutions or treatments to manage the pandemic. However, no standard treatment for this disease has been discovered to date. Probably, preventing the severe acute respiratory infection form of COVID-19 as the most dangerous phase of this disease can be helpful for the treatment and reduction of the death rate. In this regard, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)-based immunomodulation treatment has been proposed as a suitable therapeutic approach and several clinical trials have begun. Recently, MSCs according to their immunomodulatory and regenerative properties attract attention in clinical trials. After the intravenous transplantation of MSCs, a significant population of cells accumulates in the lung, which they alongside immunomodulatory effect could protect alveolar epithelial cells, reclaim the pulmonary microenvironment, prevent pulmonary fibrosis, and cure lung dysfunction. Given the uncertainties in this area, we reviewed reported clinical trials and hypotheses to provide useful information to researchers and those interested in stem cell therapy. In this study, we considered this new approach to improve patient's immunological responses to COVID-19 using MSCs and discussed the aspects of this proposed treatment. However, currently, there are no approved MSC-based approaches for the prevention and/or treatment of COVID-19 patients but clinical trials ongoing.","Golchin, Ali; Seyedjafari, Ehsan; Ardeshirylajimi, Abdolreza",Stem Cell Rev Rep,,43
434639,Head and neck oncology during the COVID-19 pandemic: Reconsidering traditional treatment paradigms in light of new surgical and other multilevel risks,2020,"Herein, we consider venous immunothrombotic mechanisms in SARS-CoV-2 infection and anti-SARS-CoV-2 DNA vaccination. Primary SARS-CoV-2 infection with systemic viral RNA release (RNAaemia) contributes to innate immune coagulation cascade activation, with both pulmonary and systemic immunothrombosis - including venous territory strokes. However, anti-SARS-CoV-2 adenoviral-vectored-DNA vaccines -initially shown for the ChAdOx1 vaccine-may rarely exhibit autoimmunity with autoantibodies to Platelet Factor-4 (PF4) that is termed Vaccine-Induced Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT), an entity pathophysiologically similar to Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia (HIT). The PF4 autoantigen is a polyanion molecule capable of independent interactions with negatively charged bacterial cellular wall, heparin and DNA molecules, thus linking intravascular innate immunity to both bacterial cell walls and pathogen-derived DNA. Crucially, negatively charged extracellular DNA is a powerful adjuvant that can break tolerance to positively charged nuclear histone proteins in many experimental autoimmunity settings, including SLE and scleroderma. Analogous to DNA-histone interactons, positively charged PF4-DNA complexes stimulate strong interferon responses via Toll-Like Receptor (TLR) 9 engagement. A chain of events following intramuscular adenoviral-vectored-DNA vaccine inoculation including microvascular damage; microbleeding and platelet activation with PF4 release, adenovirus cargo dispersement with DNA-PF4 engagement may rarely break immune tolerance, leading to rare PF4-directed autoimmunity. The VITT cavernous sinus cerebral and intestinal venous territory immunothrombosis proclivity may pertain to venous drainage of shared microbiotal-rich areas of the nose and in intestines that initiates local endovascular venous immunity by PF4/microbiotal engagement with PF4 autoantibody driven immunothrombosis reminiscent of HIT. According to the proposed model, any adenovirus-vectored-DNA vaccine could drive autoimmune VITT in susceptible individuals and alternative mechanism based on molecular mimicry, vaccine protein contaminants, adenovirus vector proteins, EDTA buffers or immunity against the viral spike protein are secondary factors. Hence, electrochemical DNA-PF4 interactions and PF4-heparin interactions, but at different locations, represent the common denominator in HIT and VITT related autoimmune-mediated thrombosis.","McGonagle, Dennis; De Marco, Gabriele; Bridgewood, Charles",J Autoimmun,,43

441643,Cancer Versus COVID-19: A Coordinated Disease Outbreak Response System (DORS) to Combat COVID-19 at the National Cancer Centre Singapore,2020,"Urinary volatile compounds (VCs) have been recently assessed for disease diagnoses. They belong to very diverse chemical classes, and they are characterized by different volatilities, polarities and concentrations, complicating their analysis via a single analytical procedure. There remains a need for better, lower-cost methods for VC biomarker discovery. Thus, there is a strong need for alternative methods, enabling the detection of a broader range of VCs. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to optimize a simple and reliable liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) procedure for the analysis of VCs in urine using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), in order to obtain the maximum number of responses. Extraction parameters such as pH, type of solvent and ionic strength were optimized. Moreover, the same extracts were analyzed using Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-NMR), to evaluate the applicability of a single urine extraction for multiplatform purposes. After the evaluation of experimental conditions, an LLE protocol using 2 mL of urine in the presence of 2 mL of 1 M sulfuric acid and sodium sulphate extracted with dichloromethane was found to be optimal. The optimized method was validated with the external standards and was found to be precise and linear, and allowed for detection of >400 peaks in a single run present in at least 50% of six samples-considerably more than the number of peaks detected by solid-phase microextracton fiber pre-concentration-GC-MS (328 ± 6 vs. 234 ± 4). 1H-NMR spectroscopy of the polar and non-polar extracts extended the range to >40 more (mainly low volatility compounds) metabolites (non-destructively), the majority of which were different from GC-MS. The more peaks detectable, the greater the opportunity of assessing a fingerprint of several compounds to aid biomarker discovery. In summary, we have successfully demonstrated the potential of LLE as a cheap and simple alternative for the analysis of VCs in urine, and for the first time the applicability of a single urine solvent extraction procedure for detecting a wide range of analytes using both GC-MS and 1H-NMR analysis to enhance putative biomarker detection. The proposed method will simplify the transport between laboratories and storage of samples, as compared to intact urine samples.","Drabinska, Natalia; Mlynarz, Piotr; de Lacy Costello, Ben; Jones, Peter; Mielko, Karolina; Mielnik, Justyna; Persad, Raj; Ratcliffe, Norman Mark",Molecules (Basel),,43

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this online survey was to assess the changes and current status of rheumatology departments and practices in Germany. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was designed to differentiate the impact of the pandemic on inpatient and outpatient operations. Questions addressed the following issues: characteristics of the department, impact on patient care, application of recommendations, personal protective equipment (PPE), and organizational adaptations to the new framework conditions. The survey was available for 14 days and closed on 3 May 2020. RESULTS: A total of 66 complete answers were recorded and evaluated. In the first 4 weeks of the COVID-19 crisis the proportion of outpatients in the institutions decreased on average by -40.6%. The number of outpatients receiving infusions decreased by -25.6%. Of the inpatient facilities 81% reported an average decrease of hospitalized patients of -54.9% and 52% of the participants complained of a lack of PPE. Organizational adjustments are reported. CONCLUSION: The rheumatological services were significantly reduced 4 weeks after the SARS-CoV­2 pandemic had reached Germany on a large scale. The study showed that in this phase there were decisive turning points in patient care and implicated substantial organizational and ultimately also economic effects on the healthcare system, both in hospitals and private practices. As the survey cannot adapt to the daily dynamic changes in priorities it serves as a first snapshot, which requires follow-up studies.","Freudenberg, S; Vossen, D",Z Rheumatol,,43

458631,Olfactory and Gustatory Dysfunction in Covid-19: An Observational Study in a Tertiary Care Institute of Western Rajasthan,2021,"OBJECTIVE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has dominated the attention of health care systems globally since January 2020. Various health disciplines including physical therapists are still exploring the best way to manage this new disease. The role and involvement of physical therapists in the management of COVID-19 are not yet well defined and are limited in many hospitals. This article reports a physical therapy service specially commissioned by the Health Commission of Sichuan Province to manage COVID-19 during patients' stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) at the Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu in China. METHODS: Patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were classified into 4 categories under a directive from the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. Patients in the ""severe"" and ""critical"" categories were admitted to the ICU irrespective whether mechanical ventilation was required. Between January 31, 2020, and March 8, 2020, a cohort of 16 patients was admitted to the ICU at the Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu. The median (minimum to maximum) hospital and ICU stays for these patients were 27 (11-46) and 15 (6-38) days, respectively. Medical management included antiviral, immunoregulation and supportive treatment of associated comorbidities. Physical therapist interventions included body positioning, airway clearance techniques, oscillatory positive end-expiratory pressure, inspiratory muscle training, and mobility exercises. All patients had at least 1 comorbidity. Three of the 16 patients required mechanical ventilation and were excluded for outcome measures that required understanding of verbal instructions. In the remaining 13 patients, respiratory outcomes-including the Borg Dyspnea Scale, peak expiratory flow rate, Pao2/Fio2 ratio, maximal inspiratory pressure, strength outcomes, Medical Research Council Sum Score, and functional outcomes (including the Physical Function in Intensive Care Test score, De Morton Mobility Index, and Modified Barthel Index)-were measured on the first day the patient received the physical therapist intervention and at discharge. RESULTS: At discharge from the ICU, while most outcome measures were near normal for the majority of the patients, 61% and 31% of these patients had peak expiratory flow rate and maximal inspiratory pressure below 80% of the predicted value and 46% had De Morton Mobility Index values below the normative value. CONCLUSION: The respiratory and physical functions of some patients remained poor at ICU discharge, suggesting that long-term rehabilitation may be required for these patients. IMPACT: Our experience in the management of patients with COVID-19 has revealed that physical therapist intervention is safe and appears to be associated with an improvement in respiratory and physical function in patients with COVID-19 in the ICU.","Li, Lei; Yu, Pengming; Yang, Mengxuan; Xie, Wei; Huang, Liyi; He, Chengqi; Gosselink, Rik; Quan, Wei; Jones, Alice Y M",Phys. ther,,43

METHODS: A decision tree analysis evaluated five strategies: (1) classifying students with symptoms as having COVID-19, (2) RT-PCR testing for symptomatic students, (3) RT-PCR testing for all students, (4) RT-PCR testing for all students and retesting symptomatic students with a negative first test, and (5) RT-PCR testing for all students and retesting all students with a negative first test. The number of true positives, true negatives, RT-PCR tests, and RT-PCR tests per true positive (TTP) was calculated. RESULTS: Strategy 5 detected the most true positives but also required the most tests. The percentage of correctly identified infections was 40.6%, 29.0%, 53.7%, 72.5%, and 86.9% for Strategies 1-5, respectively. All RT-PCR strategies detected more true negatives than the symptom-only strategy. Analysis of TTP demonstrated that the repeat RT-PCR strategies weakly dominated the single RT-PCR strategy and that the thresholds for more intensive RT-PCR testing decreased as the prevalence of infection increased. CONCLUSION: Based on TTP, the single RT-PCR strategy is never preferred. If the cost of RT-PCR testing is of concern, a staged approach involving initial testing of all returning students followed by a repeat testing decision based on the measured prevalence of infection might be considered.","Van Pelt, Amelia; Glick, Henry A; Yang, Wei; Rubin, David; Feldman, Michael; Kimmel, Stephen E",J Adolesc Health,,43
487209,Timely Reminders from COVID-19 for Dementia Care,2020,"Background: Studies documented the important role of health-care professionals in encouraging their patients to adopt and use mobile health applications. Health-care professionals who use and believe in mobile health applications are more likely to encourage and empower their patients to use it. Likewise, students in health-profession related specialties who use mobile health applications are more likely to continue to do so when they join the workforce. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the rate of adoption of mobile health applications in students in health colleges, identify the types of health applications used by health students, and identify the barriers that prevent the use of mobile health applications. Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among university students. Students were invited to participate in a self-administrated survey from five health colleges. The survey included questions about the pattern of utilization, the purpose of the health-related application being used, and the barriers to adoption. The analysis included descriptive statistics using SPSS. Results: A total of 383 students participated in this study. The within gender comparison showed that more female students were using health-related applications 59.8% compared to male students 49%. The most frequent purpose of using mobile health applications were tracking physical activities 72.5% followed by counting calories intake 44%. We also identified the frequency and duration of use as well as the factors which may impact students intention to use. Conclusion: Fitness and dietary related applications were more common which might be explained by the fact that we only included a younger age group. The reported levels of perceived usefulness, accessibility and ease of use suggest that students will continue to use it.","Jabour, Abdulrahman M.; Rehman, Wajiha Idrees Sumaira Thanganadar Hemalatha Kiani Hira Alarifi Mohammad A.",Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare,,43
487394,Highlights from this issue,2020,"BACKGROUND: Respiratory viruses (RVs) is a common cause of illness in people of all ages, at present, different types of sampling methods are available for respiratory viral diagnosis. However, the diversity of available sampling methods and the limited direct comparisons in randomised controlled trials (RCTs) make decision-making difficult. We did a network meta-analysis, which accounted for both direct and indirect comparisons, to determine the detection rate of different sampling methods for RVs. METHODS: Relevant articles were retrieved comprehensively by searching the online databases of PubMed, Embase and Cochrane published before 25 March 2020. With the help of R V.3.6.3 software and 'GeMTC V.0.8.2' package, network meta-analysis was performed within a Bayesian framework. Node-splitting method and I 2 test combined leverage graphs and Gelman-Rubin-Brooks plots were conducted to evaluate the model's accuracy. The rank probabilities in direct and cumulative rank plots were also incorporated to rank the corresponding sampling methods for overall and specific virus. RESULTS: 16 sampling methods with 54 438 samples from 57 literatures were ultimately involved in this study. The model indicated good consistency and convergence but high heterogeneity, hence, random-effect analysis was applied. The top three sampling methods for RVs were nasopharyngeal wash (NPW), mid-turbinate swab (MTS) and nasopharyngeal swab (NPS). Despite certain differences, the results of virus-specific subanalysis were basically consistent with RVs: MTS, NPW and NPS for influenza; MTS, NPS and NPW for influenza-a and b; saliva, NPW and NPS for rhinovirus and parainfluenza; NPW, MTS and nasopharyngeal aspirate for respiratory syncytial virus; saliva, NPW and MTS for adenovirus and sputum; MTS and NPS for coronavirus. CONCLUSION: This network meta-analysis provides supporting evidences that NPW, MTS and NPS have higher diagnostic value regarding RVs infection, moreover, particular preferred methods should be considered in terms of specific virus pandemic. Of course, subsequent RCTs with larger samples are required to validate our findings.","Hou, Nianzong; Wang, Kai; Zhang, Haiyang; Bai, Mingjian; Chen, Hao; Song, Weidong; Jia, Fusen; Zhang, Yi; Han, Shiliang; Xie, Bing",,,43

Opting for proactive E-health services is the best thing. It helps the remote patients to share their confidential data through secured encryption. Telehealth services are emerging element in these proactive medical sciences. It helps the remote patients to share their confidential data through secured transmission. In this paper, amino acid guided matrix encoding scheme has been proposed. White blood cell count or Leukocute count is a dominant indicator of patients' health condition, even amid COVID-19. An abnormal growth in leukocyte count is mainly caused due to an infection, cancer, or any other severe symptoms. It initiates internal haematological inflammations, cardiovascular diseases, Type II diabetes, etc. Therefore, tracking leukocyte count may for disease diagnosis and further treatments. The leukocyte count is generally done in different pathologies, and the data evaluation needs the expertise of a pathologist. In this paper, a technique involving security measures to transmit the result of the histological test with the help of cryptography has been proposed. The data to be transferred to the concerned physician for further diagnosis with the help of proposed way of encryption using amino acids, which ensures no data loss, no data modification, no data theft in the middle of transmission. The proposed encryption method using the amino acid codes has produced results showing satisfactory performances such as p-values found to be 7.215544e-04 and 8.48904e-03 for the key stream and cipher key matrix monobit test respectively, and 8.10245e-04 and 8.10245e-04 for the key stream and cipher key matrix frequency test respectively.

The pathophysiological mechanisms are unclear, but endothelial damage secondary to systemic vasculitis and the onset of anticoagulation therapy, both associated with severe forms of the infection, have been proposed to play a role in the development of this complication. We present the case of a 66-year-old man who presented to the emergency department with acute abdominal pain, hypotension and decrease of consciousness, a few hours after being discharged after a prolonged hospitalisation of 26 days due to severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Initial resuscitation was carried out and, when haemodynamic stabilisation was achieved, a computed tomography scan showed contrast extravasation at the topography of the greater omentum. Urgent angiography revealing contrast extravasation originating in a pseudoaneurysm dependent on the right gastroepiploic artery was done, and embolisation with cyanoacrylate was performed at the bleeding point. Owing to persistent haemodynamic instability despite angiographic treatment and aggressive resuscitation, emergency laparotomy was indicated. Partial resection of the greater omentum was carried out and histopathologic examination showed a 5cm×4cm×6cm haematoma, with no signs of abnormalities such as aneurysm or malignancy. No rebleeding occurred. Spontaneous haemorrhage of the greater omentum associated with haemoperitoneum is a serious condition, with reported mortality rates exceeding 30%. This case highlights a very infrequent but potentially life-threatening complication in a patient diagnosed with COVID-19 on anticoagulation therapy.","Viñas, J.; Amor, M.

494725,Cross-reaction of Sera from COVID-19 Patients with SARS-CoV Assays,2020,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 outbreak, facility capacity for HIV testing has been limited. Further, people may have opted against HIV testing during this period to avoid COVID-19 exposure. We investigated the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV testing and the number of reported HIV cases in Japan. METHODS: We analyzed quarterly HIV/AIDS-related data from 2015 to the second quarter of 2020 using an anomaly detection approach. The data included the number of consultations, the number of HIV tests performed by public health centers or municipalities, and the number of newly reported HIV cases with and without an AIDS diagnosis. We further performed the same analysis for two subgroups: men who have sex with men (MSM) and non-Japanese persons. RESULTS: The number of HIV tests (9,584 vs. 35,908 in the year-before period) and consultations (11,689 vs. 32,565) performed by public health centers significantly declined in the second quarter of 2020, while the proportion of new HIV cases with an AIDS diagnosis (36.2% vs. 26.4%) significantly increased after removing the trend and seasonality effects. HIV cases without an AIDS diagnosis decreased (166 vs. 217), but the reduction was not significant. We confirmed similar trends for the MSM and non-Japanese subgroups. CONCLUSION: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the current HIV testing system in Japan seems to have missed more cases of HIV before developing AIDS. Continuously monitoring the situation as well as securing sufficient test resources by use of self-testing is essential to understand the clear epidemiological picture of HIV incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Ejima, Keisuke; Koizumi, Yoshiki; Yamamoto, Nao; Rosenberg, Molly; Ludema, Christina; Bento, Ana I; Yoneoka, Daisuke; Ichikawa, Seiichi; Mizushima, Daisuke; Iwami, Shingo",J. acquir. immune defic. syndr,,43
501683,Adding value to tumor staging in head and neck cancer: The role of metabolic parameters as prognostic factors,2021,"A growing body of evidence suggests that diet quality may predict muscle health. This study found that a ""Traditional"" dietary pattern predicted greater muscle mass, and an anti-inflammatory diet predicted greater muscle mass and better muscle function over 15 years. These findings reinforce the importance of optimising dietary behaviours for healthy ageing. INTRODUCTION: Research investigating the roles of individual nutrients in muscle health fails to account for the synergistic relationships between foods and nutrients. This study aimed to investigate the predictive value of diet quality and dietary patterns for muscle mass and function in men over a 15-year period. METHODS: This longitudinal study was conducted in 522 men from the Geelong Osteoporosis Study with complete dietary and muscle mass or muscle function data at both baseline and 15-year follow-up assessments. Dietary exposures were extracted from food frequency questionnaires and included the Australian Recommended Food Score, the Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII®), and three a posteriori dietary patterns: Plant-focused, Western, and Traditional (Anglo-Australian). Outcome variables included dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-derived skeletal muscle index (SMI) and muscle function measured with the timed up-and-go (TUG) test. RESULTS: An anti-inflammatory diet and higher scores on a Traditional dietary pattern both predicted greater SMI ((B: -0.04 (95%CI -0.08, -0.00) kg/m2) and (B: 0.12 (95%CI 0.04, 0.20) kg/m2), respectively), while a pro-inflammatory diet predicted slower TUG (B: 0.11 (95%CI 0.001, 0.21) sec) over the 15-year follow-up period. These associations remained significant following adjustment for confounding variables. There were no associations observed for other dietary exposures. CONCLUSION: A Traditional dietary pattern higher in vegetables, wholegrain cereals, and animal protein was associated with greater skeletal muscle mass, and an anti-inflammatory diet, also rich in vegetables, fruit, and wholegrain cereals, was associated with greater skeletal muscle mass and better muscle function over 15 years.","Davis, J A; Mohebbi, M; Collier, F; Loughman, A; Staudacher, H; Shivappa, N; Hébert, J R; Pasco, J A; Jacka, F N",Osteoporosis int,,43

Our objective is to describe the methods used to collect and ensure the data quality of a multicentre registry of patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. METHODS: This methodology study describes a population-based registry that has been enrolling consecutive patients presenting to the emergency department with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 since Mar. 1, 2020. Most data are collected from retrospective chart review. Phone follow-up with patients at 30 days captures the World Health Organization clinical improvement scale and contextual, social and cultural variables. Phone follow-up also captures patient-reported quality of life using the Veterans Rand 12-Item Health Survey at 30 days, 60 days, 6 months and 12 months. Fifty participating emergency departments from 8 provinces in Canada currently enrol patients into the registry. INTERPRETATION: Data from the registry of the Canadian COVID-19 Emergency Department Rapid Response Network will be used to derive and validate clinical decision rules to inform clinical decision-making, describe the natural history of the disease, evaluate COVID-19 diagnostic tests and establish the real-world effectiveness of treatments and vaccines, including in populations that are excluded or underrepresented in clinical trials.

516845,Highlights from this issue,2021,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic has spread globally, causing extensive illness and mortality. In advance of effective antiviral therapies, countries have applied different public-health strategies to control spread and manage healthcare need. Sweden has taken a unique approach of not implementing strict closures, instead urging personal responsibility. We analyze the results of this and other potential strategies for pandemic control in Sweden. METHODS: We implemented individual-based modeling of COVID-19 spread in Sweden using population, employment, and household data. Epidemiological parameters for COVID-19 were validated on a limited date range; where substantial uncertainties remained, multiple parameters were tested. The effects of different public-health strategies were tested over a 160-day period, analyzed for their effects on ICU demand and death rate, and compared to Swedish data for April 2020. RESULTS: Swedish mortality rates fall intermediate between European countries that quickly imposed stringent public-health controls and countries that acted later. Models most closely reproducing reported mortality data suggest large portions of the population voluntarily self-isolate. Swedish ICU utilization rates remained lower than predicted, but a large fraction of deaths occurred in non-ICU patients. This suggests that patient prognosis was considered in ICU admission, reducing healthcare load at a cost of decreased survival in patients not admitted. CONCLUSIONS: The Swedish COVID-19 strategy has thus far yielded a striking result: mild mandates overlaid with voluntary measures can achieve results highly similar to late-onset stringent mandates. However, this policy causes more healthcare demand and mortality than early stringent control and depends on continued public will.","Kamerlin, Shina C L; Kasson, Peter M",Clin. infect. dis,,43

The study focuses on Italy, which experienced significant restrictions imposed by local authorities, but results about Spain, France, Germany, Sweden, and the whole of Europe are also included. The analysis of a large set of measurements shows that the impact on the network can be significant, especially in terms of increased variability of latency. In Italy we observed that the standard deviation of the average additional delay – the additional time with respect to the minimum delay of the paths in the region – during lockdown is ∼3−4 times as much as the value before the pandemic. Similarly, in Italy, packet loss is ∼2−3 times as much as before the pandemic.

We aim to assess the clinical characteristics, outcomes and factors associated with hospital admission or death in adult outpatients with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort of outpatients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, registered in Covidom telesurveillance solution for home monitoring of patients with COVID-19 in the Greater Paris area, from March to August 2020. The primary outcome was clinical worsening, defined as hospitalization or death within 1 month after symptom onset. RESULTS: Among 43,103 patients, mean age was 42.9 years (SD=14.3); 93.0% (n=40,081) of patients were < 65 years old and 61.9% (n=26,688) were women. Of these 43,103 patients, 67.5% (n=29,104) completed a medical questionnaire on comorbidities and symptoms. The main reported comorbidities were asthma (12.8%; n=3,685), hypertension (12.3%; n=3,546) and diabetes (4.8%; n=1,385). A small proportion of all eligible patients (4.1% [95% CI: 3.9–4.2]; 1,751/43,103) experienced clinical worsening. The rate of hospitalisation was 4.0% (95% CI: 3.8–4.2; n=1,728) and 0.1% (95% CI: 0.1–0.2; n=64) died. Factors associated with clinical worsening were male sex, older age, obesity and comorbidities such as chronic renal disease or cancer under treatment. Probability of worsening was reduced with anosmia/ageusia. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical worsening was rare among outpatients. Male sex, older age and comorbidities such as chronic renal disease, active cancers or obesity were independently associated with clinical worsening. However, our cohort may include patients younger and healthier than the general population.","Yordanov, Youri; Dinh, Aurélien; Bleibtreu, Alexandre; Mensch, Arthur; Lescure, François-Xavier; Debuc, Erwan; Jourdain, Patrick; Jaulmes, Luc; Dechartres, Agnes",Clin Microbiol Infect,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33915287/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1198743X21001932; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cmi.2021.04.010; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1198743X21001932?v=s5,43

Because modulating −1 PRF can attenuate viral propagation, ligands binding to the viral RNA pseudoknot that stimulates −1 PRF may prove useful as therapeutics. Mutations in the pseudoknot have been observed over the course of the pandemic, but how they affect −1 PRF and the activity of inhibitors is unknown. Cataloguing natural mutations in all parts of the SARS-CoV-2 pseudoknot, we studied a panel of 6 mutations in key structural regions. Most mutations left the −1 PRF efficiency unchanged, even when base-pairing was disrupted, but one led to a remarkable three-fold decrease, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 propagation may be less sensitive to modulation of −1 PRF efficiency than some other viruses. Examining the effects of one of the few small-molecule ligands known to suppress −1 PRF significantly in SARS-CoV, we found that it did so by similar amounts in all SARS-CoV-2 mutants tested, regardless of the basal −1 PRF efficiency, indicating that the activity of anti-frameshifting ligands can be resistant to natural pseudoknot mutations. These results have important implications for therapeutic strategies targeting SARS-CoV-2 through modulation of −1 PRF.","Neupane, Krishna; Munshi, Sneha; Zhao, Meng; Ritchie, Dustin B.; Ileperuma, Sandaru M.; Woodside, Michael T.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.29.178707,43

Sometimes by the time a successful vaccine is out for public use, the outbreak may already be over. With no vaccine or antiviral drug available to treat the infected, we are left with the age-old methods of isolation, quarantine, and rest, to arrest such a viral outbreak. Convalescent blood therapy and covalent plasma therapy have often proved effective in reducing mortality, however, the role of innate and adaptive immune cells in these therapies have been overlooked. Antigen presenting cells (APCs), CD4+ T memory cells, CD8+ T memory cells, and memory B-Cells all play a vital role in sustainable defense and subsequent recovery. This report incorporates all these aspects by suggesting a novel treatment therapy called selective convalescent leukapheresis and transfusion (SCLT) and also highlights its potential in vaccination. The anticipated advantages of the proposed technique outweigh the cost, time, and efficiency of other available transfusion and vaccination processes. It is envisioned that in the future this new approach could serve as a rapid emergency response to subdue a pathogen outbreak and to stop it from becoming an epidemic, or pandemic.","Mukherjee, Arka Prava",Int J Med Sci,https://doi.org/10.7150/ijms.46363; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34522165/,43

Despite the importance of this process, little research has been completed to ensure the process efficiently addresses applicant preferences on interview day and the surrounding process. This study aimed to determine the factors influencing the family medicine applicant preferences regarding the pre-interview, interview, and post-interview ranking process. Methods The study method was a cross-sectional electronic survey utilizing anonymous questionnaires that assessed demographics, pre-interview, interview, post-interview ranking preference, and applicants' experiences applying to a community-based family medicine residency program after their interview for the 2020 application cycle. Results Out of the 106 family medicine applicants, 48 responded; 52.08% were males, 52.5% were married, 58.33% applicants were from the osteopathic medical school, 33.33% were from the allopathic Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) non accredited medical school/international medical graduates (IMG's), and 8.33% were from the allopathic LCME accredited medical schools. Free hotel accommodation was not offered from half of the programs to 27.8% of the applicants in the 2020 match cycle (pre-pandemic). Respondents favored electronic means of scheduling interviews with a positive experience with the online self-scheduling Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) calendar. A significantly higher proportion of IMGs applied to a higher number of family medicine programs followed by the osteopathic applicants. There was no statistical difference found between osteopathic and allopathic applicants for the number of programs they got invited to; however, the difference was significant for osteopathic and allopathic LCME accredited applicants who interviewed and ranked programs in the range of 11-20 (62.96%, p=0.0013 and 66.67%, p=0.0018, respectively). The respondents' most important experiences were interviewing the program director, faculty members, and tour the hospital facility. When ranking programs, these family medicine applicants considered the strength of program training, the quality of current residents, and the program's geographic location as the top three most significant factors, with mean importance ratings of 5.08, 5.02, and 4.35, respectively. Applicants also considered how the current residents perceive the program director, prior teaching experience, and program diversity with mean importance ratings of 3.42, 2.89, and 2.09, respectively. Conclusion Although applicants' preferences for family medicine residency programs are similar to generally reported by The National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) surveys, some key differences do exist. The program leadership should consider these preferences from the candidates’ perspective for a successful match in family medicine residency on both sides.","Waheed, Abdul; Rana, Masooma S; Rauf, Muhammad A; Green, Landen; Green, Salma; Azhar, Erum",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.11054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33101791/,43

This study aimed to assess factors associated with mental health among Lebanese HCWs six months after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional study was conducted among HCWs at a tertiary hospital, in Lebanon between June and July 2020. The survey included data on demographics, exposure to COVID-19, preparedness to COVID-19 outbreak, risk perceptions of COVID-19, and mental health dimensions. Chi-squared and Fisher’s exact tests were used to understand the association among these variables. One hundred and ninety-three of 1,600 Lebanese HCWs participated. More than 80% reported high preparedness levels towards the COVID-19 outbreak, 69% believed that their job was putting them at risk, and 70% altruistically accepted these risks. Anxiety and depression symptomatology were present in 24% and 23% of HCWs; who were more likely to feel more stress at work (83% vs 60%; p = 0.004; 82% vs 61%; p = 0.01, respectively), feel afraid of falling ill (72% vs 55%; p = 0.03; 77% vs 54%; p = 0.01, respectively), fear death (21% vs 7%; p = 0.01; 25% vs 6%; p ≤ 0.001, respectively), and believed that people avoided their families (39% vs 21%; p = 0.01; 35% vs 65%; p = 0.02, respectively). HCWs who reported signs of depression were less likely to altruistically accept the risks of caring for COVID-19 patients, compared to those who did not (57% vs 74%; p = 0.03). This study aimed to detect factors associated with mental health among Lebanese HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings suggested that altruistic acceptance of COVID-19 risks is higher among HCWs with positive exposure history to COVID-19 and those with less depressive symptomatology.","Msheik El Khoury, Fatima; Talih, Farid; Khatib, Mohamad F El; Abi Younes, Nadine; Siddik, Midhat; Siddik-Sayyid, Sahar",The Libyan journal of medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/19932820.2021.1901438; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33820499/,43

Lockdown started in Jordan and around the globe affecting several aspects of life including economy, education, entertainment, and government policies. Regarding education, the priority was to ensure the safety and progress of the educational process. Thus, new methods of teaching had to be applied using the online learning at Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST), Faculty of Medicine. This study was done to assess (1) Class Experience (2) Students and Lecturers' Interaction (3) Online Learning Advantages & Disadvantages (4) Students’ Preference. METHODS: A cross sectional study was conducted Convenience sampling technique was used to collect the data from the participants using a survey composed of 18 questions on Google Forms platform. A link was sent to the undergraduate medical students at the Jordan University of Science & Technology via their e-learning accounts (n = 3700). The form was available from May 22nd, 2020 to May 30th, 2020 for 8 days long. Data analysis was done using SPSS V 23. RESULTS: 2212 out of 3700 students responded, (55.8%) of them were in the basic years and (44.2%) of them were in the clinical years. (55.8%) of students started to take online lectures after 3 weeks. (45.7%) used the hybrid teaching method (asynchronous and synchronous), (31.4%) used live classes, and 22.8% recorded classes. Zoom was the most used platform. (48.7%) and (57%) of clinical students and basic students express their interaction as bad, while the others had good and excellent interaction. Maintaining social distance was the most advantage of online teaching, while poor technical setup and no direct contact were the most disadvantage, furthermore inability to have real clinical access was a significant problem for clinical students (p < .001). With reference to students’ preferences 75% of students were not pleased with their experience and 42% of students prefer to integrate online learning with traditional learning. CONCLUSION: Most medical students at JUST preferred the traditional face-to-face teaching method over the solo online teaching methods with recommendations to convert to a more integrated educational system. Also, a well-established infrastructure should be done in involving online teaching.","Sindiani, Amer Mahmoud; Obeidat, Nail; Alshdaifat, Eman; Elsalem, Lina; Alwani, Mustafa M.; Rawashdeh, Hasan; Fares, Ahmad S.; Alalawne, Tamara; Tawalbeh, Loai Issa",Ann Med Surg (Lond),https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2049080120303411; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.amsu.2020.09.036; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33042535/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2049080120303411?v=s5,43
648400,COVID-19 Airway Management Isolation Chamber,2020-07-14,"INTRODUCTION: Australia recorded its first case of COVID-19 in late January 2020. On 22P March 2020, amid increasing daily case numbers, the Australian Government implemented lockdown restrictions to help ‘flatten the curve’. Our study aimed to understand the impact of lockdown restrictions on sexual and reproductive health. Here we focus on sexual practices. METHODS: An online survey was open from the 23PP April 2020 to 11P May 2020. Participants were recruited online via social media and other networks and were asked to report on their sexual practices in 2019 and during lockdown. Logistic regression was used to calculate the difference (diff) (including 95% CIs) in the proportion of sex practices between time periods. RESULTS: Of the 1187 who commenced the survey, 965 (81.3%) completed it. Overall, 70% were female and 66.3% were aged 18–29 years. Most (53.5%) reported less sex during lockdown than in 2019. Compared with 2019, participants were more likely to report sex with a spouse (35.3% vs 41.7%; diff=6.4%; 95% CI 3.6 to 9.2) and less likely to report sex with a girl/boyfriend (45.1% vs 41.8%; diff=−3.3%; 95% CI −7.0 to -0.4) or with casual hook-up (31.4% vs 7.8%; 95% CI −26.9 to -19.8). Solo sex activities increased; 14.6% (123/840) reported using sex toys more often and 26.0% (218/838) reported masturbating more often. Dating app use decreased during lockdown compared with 2019 (42.1% vs 27.3%; diff= −14.8%; 95% CI −17.6 to -11.9). Using dating apps for chatting/texting (89.8% vs 94.5%; diff=4.7%; 95% CI 1.0 to 8.5) and for setting up virtual dates (2.6% vs 17.2%; diff=14.6%; 95% CI 10.1 to 19.2) increased during lockdown. CONCLUSION: Although significant declines in sexual activity during lockdown were reported, people did not completely stop engaging in sexual activities, highlighting the importance of ensuring availability of normal sexual and reproductive health services during global emergencies.","Coombe, Jacqueline; Kong, Fabian Yuh Shiong; Bittleston, Helen; Williams, Henrietta; Tomnay, Jane; Vaisey, Alaina; Malta, Sue; Goller, Jane L; Temple-Smith, Meredith; Bourchier, Louise; Lau, Andrew; Chow, Eric P F; Hocking, Jane S",Sex Transm Infect,https://doi.org/10.1136/sextrans-2020-054688; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33203737/,43

While great strides have been made toward understanding and combating the mechanisms of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, relatively little is known about the individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins that contribute to pathogenicity during infection and that cause neurological sequela after viral clearance. We used Drosophila to develop an in vivo model that characterizes mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity, and found ORF3a adversely affects longevity and motor function by inducing apoptosis and inflammation in the nervous system. Chloroquine alleviated ORF3a induced phenotypes in the CNS, arguing our Drosophila model is amenable to high throughput drug screening. Our work provides novel insights into the pathogenic nature of SARS-CoV-2 in the nervous system that can be used to develop new treatment strategies for post-viral syndrome.","Yang, Shuo; Tian, Meijie; Johnson, Aaron N.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.20.423533; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33398283/,43
653326,Covid19 pandemic; A practicing head and neck surgeon’s perspective of an institutional model,2020-05-14,"COVID-19 is a global catastrophic event that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome. The mechanism of the disease remains unclear, and hypoxia is one of the main complications. There is no currently approved protocol for treatment. The microbial threat as induced by COVID-19 causes the activation of macrophages to produce a huge amount of inflammatory molecules and nitric oxide (NO). Activation of macrophages population into a pro-inflammatory phenotype induces a self-reinforcing cycle. Oxidative stress and NO contribute to this cycle, establishing a cascade inflammatory state that can kill the patient. Interrupting this vicious cycle by a simple remedy may save critical patients’ lives. Nitrite, nitrate (the metabolites of NO), methemoglobin, and prooxidant-antioxidant-balance levels were measured in 25 ICU COVID-19 patients and 25 healthy individuals. As the last therapeutic option, five patients were administered methylene blue-vitamin C–N-acetyl Cysteine (MCN). Nitrite, nitrate, methemoglobin, and oxidative stress were significantly increased in patients in comparison to healthy individuals. Four of the five patients responded well to treatment. In conclusion, NO, methemoglobin and oxidative stress may play a central role in the pathogenesis of critical COVID-19 disease. MCN treatment seems to increase the survival rate of these patients. Considering the vicious cycle of macrophage activation leading to deadly NO, oxidative stress, and cytokine cascade syndrome; the therapeutic effect of MCN seems to be reasonable. Accordingly, a wider clinical trial has been designed. It should be noted that the protocol is using the low-cost drugs which the FDA approved for other diseases.

657230,“The early effects Of COVID-19 on head and neck oncology and microvascular reconstruction practice: National survey of oral and maxillofacial surgeons enrolled in the head and neck special interest group”,2020-07-17,"AIM: The recent availability of vaccines against COVID-19 has sparked national and international debate on the feasibility of administering them to pregnant and lactating women, given that these vaccines have not been tested to assess their safety and efficacy in such women. As concerns the risks of COVID-induced disease, published data show that pregnant women who develop COVID-19 have fewer symptoms than patients who are not pregnant, but they are more likely to need hospitalization in intensive care, and neonatal morbidity. Aim of the present perspective paper is to analyze the current literature regarding the use of the vaccine against COVID-19 infection, in terms of safety and protection, in high risk pregnant women as those affected by diabetes and obesity. METHODS: Analysis of literature about vaccination against COVID-19 infection in pregnancy. RESULTS: The main health organizations and international scientific societies, emphasize that—although data regarding the use of COVID vaccines during pregnancy and lactation are still lacking—vaccination should not be contraindicated. It should be considered for pregnant women at high risk of exposure to COVID-19. For such women, the potential benefits and risks should be assessed by the healthcare professionals caring for them. A recent prospective study to test the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of vaccination with COVID-19 mRNA in pregnant and lactating women, has showed that SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination triggers a robust humoral immunity in pregnant and lactating women; there was also evidence of an immune transfer to their newborn. CONCLUSIONS: We urgently need data on the effect of COVID-19 vaccination, in terms of maternal and fetal outcomes and vaccine related symptoms in high risk women during pregnancy and breastfeeding. It is important to run campaigns to promote vaccination, in particular in pregnant women at high risk to have severe COVID infection as those diabetics and/or obese.","Lapolla, A.; Dalfrà, M.

659493,Impact of a Dyadic Intervention on Family Supporter Involvement in Helping Adults Manage Type 2 Diabetes,2021-07-08,"BACKGROUND: Frailty, increased vulnerability to physiological stressors, is associated with adverse outcomes. COVID-19 exhibits a more severe disease course in older, co-morbid adults. Awareness of atypical presentations is critical to facilitate early identification. OBJECTIVE: To assess how frailty affects presenting COVID-19 symptoms in older adults. DESIGN: Observational cohort study of hospitalised older patients and self-report data for community-based older adults. SETTING: Admissions to St Thomas’ Hospital, London with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Community-based data for older adults using the COVID Symptom Study mobile application. SUBJECTS: Hospital cohort: patients aged 65 and over (n = 322); unscheduled hospital admission between March 1(st), 2020-May 5(th), 2020; COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR of nasopharyngeal swab. Community-based cohort: participants aged 65 and over enrolled in the COVID Symptom Study (n = 535); reported test-positive for COVID-19 from March 24th (application launch)-May 8(th), 2020. METHODS: Multivariable logistic regression analysis performed on age-matched samples from hospital and community-based cohorts to ascertain association of frailty with symptoms of confirmed COVID-19. RESULTS: Hospital cohort: significantly higher prevalence of probable delirium in the frail sample, with no difference in fever or cough. Community-based cohort: significantly higher prevalence of possible delirium in frailer, older adults, and fatigue and shortness of breath. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study demonstrating higher prevalence of probable delirium as a COVID-19 symptom in older adults with frailty compared to other older adults. This emphasises need for systematic frailty assessment and screening for delirium in acutely ill older patients in hospital and community settings. Clinicians should suspect COVID-19 in frail adults with delirium.","Zazzara, Maria Beatrice; Penfold, Rose S; Roberts, Amy L; Lee, Karla A; Dooley, Hannah; Sudre, Carole H; Welch, Carly; Bowyer, Ruth C E; Visconti, Alessia; Mangino, Massimo; Freydin, Maxim B; El-Sayed Moustafa, Julia S; Small, Kerrin; Murray, Benjamin; Modat, Marc; Wolf, Jonathan; Ourselin, Sebastien; Graham, Mark S; Martin, Finbarr C; Steves, Claire J; Lochlainn, Mary Ni",Age Ageing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32986799/; https://doi.org/10.1093/ageing/afaa223,43

Analysis with varying concentrations of urea allows to determine distinct differences in avidity maturation, though the total process remains at an unusually low level. Despite incomplete avidity maturation, this approach allows to define early and late stages of infection. It therefore can compensate for the recently described irregular kinetic patterns of immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G (IgG) directed towards SARS‐CoV‐2 antigens. The serological responses towards seasonal coronaviruses neither have a negative nor positive impact on SARS‐CoV‐2 serology in general. Avidity determination in combination with measurement of antibody titers and complexity of the immune response allows to clearly differentiate between IgG responses towards seasonal coronaviruses and SARS‐CoV‐2. Cross‐reactions seem to occur with very low probability. They can be recognized by their pattern of response and through differential treatment with urea. As high avidity has been shown to be essential in several virus systems for the protective effect of neutralizing antibodies, it should be clarified whether high avidity of IgG directed towards RBD indicates protective immunity. If this is the case, monitoring of avidity should be part of the optimization of vaccination programs.","Bauer, Georg; Struck, Friedhelm; Schreiner, Patrick; Staschik, Eva; Soutschek, Erwin; Motz, Manfred",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33565617/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26863,43
678861,Changes in Head and Neck Oncologic Practice During the COVID‐19 Pandemic,2020-05-01,"Daily, we face a plenty of negative information that can profoundly affect our perception and behavior. During devastating events such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, negative messages may hinder reasoning at individual level and social decisions in the society at large. These effects vary across genders in neurotypical populations (being more evident in women) and may be even more pronounced in individuals with neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression. Here, we examine how negative information impacts reasoning on a social perception task in females with breast cancer, a life-threatening disease. Two groups of patients and two groups of matched controls (N(TO)(TAL) = 80; median age, 50 years) accomplished a psychometrically standardized social cognition and reasoning task receiving either the standard instruction solely or additional negative information. Performance substantially dropped in patients and matched controls who received negative information compared to those who did not. Moreover, patients with negative information scored much lower not only compared with controls but also with patients without negative information. We suggest the effects of negative information are mediated by the distributed brain networks involved in affective processing and emotional memory. The findings offer novel insights on the impact of negative information on social perception and decision making during life-threatening events, fostering better understanding of its neurobiological underpinnings.","Simoes, Elisabeth; Sokolov, Alexander N.; Hahn, Markus; Fallgatter, Andreas J.; Brucker, Sara Y.; Wallwiener, Diethelm; Pavlova, Marina A.",Front Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2021.742576; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34557072/,43
