6780,Effects of mechanical ventilation with different tidal volume on oxidative stress and antioxidant in lung,2014-12-05,"Regarding limited availability of organ donors for heart transplantation, it is necessary to discuss optimal donor evaluation and donor management. In this manuscript general donor-related parameters as well as heart-specific parameters are discussed regarding international literature. In addition, ""marginal"" donors and in contrast ""optimal"" donors are defined. Donor management including optimal hemodynamic management and additional specific intensive care aspects are presented. Exact donor evaluation allows for matching the organ to the most suitable recipient and is therefore especially in the context of marginal donors a crucial step within transplantation process.","Höfer, Daniel; Aliabadi, Arezu; Ebner, Christian; Hörmann, Christoph; Mahr, Stephane; Mascherbauer, Regina; Pölzl, Gerhard; Reiter, Albert; Wasler, Andrä; Weber, Thomas; Zink, Michael; Zuckermann, Andreas; Antretter, Herwig",Wien Klin Wochenschr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102121/,643
13121,Diagnóstico diferencial de la neumonía en los tiempos del COVID-19,2020-08-03,"IMPORTANCE: Episodes of severe airway obstruction (SAO) are reported during surfactant administration. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate adherence to and impact of a surfactant protocol on adverse events. METHODS: An evidence-based protocol for surfactant administration was developed (2011), implemented (2012) and re-implemented (2014), including three major steps: lung recruitment, manual bagging, and bolus instillation. Three epochs were evaluated: E(0) (2010), E(1) (2015) and E(2) (2018). Adherence was defined as compliance with all steps. Adverse events such as hypoxia (<80%) and severe airway obstruction (SAO) were investigated. RESULTS: 197 infants (246 administrations) were included: E(0) 81 (110), E(1) 52 (63), and E(2) 64 (73). Adherence improved from 49% (E(1)) to 67% (E(2)). Full adherence to protocol significantly decreased SAO from 26% to 1.25% (E(2); p < 0.005) and hypoxia/bradycardia events (5 to 0% E(2); p < 0.005), without any side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence to a surfactant administration protocol improved over time and significantly decreased important adverse events.","Germain, Alexandra; Nouraeyan, Nina; Claveau, Martine; Leone, Marisa; Sant’Anna, Guilherme",J Perinatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7532933/,643

First, we suggest a set of generic scientific concepts that have been identified in a systematic annotation process. This set of concepts is utilised to annotate a corpus of scientific abstracts from 10 domains of Science, Technology and Medicine at the phrasal level in a joint effort with domain experts. The resulting dataset is used in a set of benchmark experiments to (a) provide baseline performance for this task, (b) examine the transferability of concepts between domains. Second, we present a state-of-the-art deep learning baseline. Further, we propose the active learning strategy for an optimal selection of instances from among the various domains in our data. The experimental results show that (1) a substantial agreement is achievable by non-experts after consultation with domain experts, (2) the baseline system achieves a fairly high F1 score, (3) active learning enables us to nearly halve the amount of required training data.","Brack, Arthur; D’Souza, Jennifer; Hoppe, Anett; Auer, Sören; Ewerth, Ralph",Advances in Information Retrieval,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148212/,643

Scientists are expected to understand and be aware of the health and safety issues associated with their profession. Regardless of the standards for laboratory safety in their country of origin and regardless of their position, all researchers require a good understanding of safety features in English before they can begin working in an English-speaking laboratory. All research institutions in English-speaking countries require all new staff to go through a safety orientation or training course before they can begin work. Your employer or institution has a legal requirement to provide you with safety training before you begin work. Generally, a safety officer, a person who acts as the institutional or departmental administrator for safety-related matters, gives the course, and a written safety test must be completed by all new employees following training before work can commence in the laboratory. It is your legal duty to cooperate with your employer or institution’s efforts to improve safety in the workplace. Not respecting safety regulations and procedures while working in a laboratory does not only put your own health and others’ at risk, but it may also have an impact on the lab’s license and may lead to disciplinary action against you.

In the Asia-Pacific region, bioethics education is less structured and often dependent on contextual constraints. This paper provides a cross-sectional analysis, describing institutional experiences in developing bioethics curriculum at two medical schools in Malaysia and Hong Kong. The medical programmes of the two institutions are distinctive in terms curriculum framework, teaching approach, and topic selection, and common challenges include implementation of bioethics courses, students’ resistance to bioethics, and limited teaching capacity, emerged as they evolve. The reported experiences revealed that there is room for improvement regarding how medical schools integrate bioethics education in regions where curriculum development remains at an early stage. At least, a bioethics education requires both top-down support from the faculty to improve teaching and educational quality, as well as from the bottom-up approach to empower students to raise awareness and concerns toward bioethics, and helps students developing reasoning through challenging issues.","Ngan, Olivia Miu Yung; Sim, Joong Hiong",International Journal of Ethics Education,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7590560/,643

We developed a simple test that uses colorimetric reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to detect SARS-CoV-2 in forty minutes from sample collection to result. METHODS: We tested 135 nasopharyngeal specimens from patients evaluated for COVID-19 infection at Massachusetts General Hospital. Specimens were either added directly to RT-LAMP reactions, inactivated by a combined chemical and heat treatment step, or inactivated then purified with a silica-particle based concentration method. Amplification was performed with two SARS-CoV-2-specific primer sets and an internal specimen control; the resulting color change was visually interpreted. RESULTS: Direct RT-LAMP testing of unprocessed specimens could only reliably detect samples with abundant SARS-CoV-2 (>3,000,000 copies/mL), with sensitivities of 50% (95% CI, 28 to 72) and 59% (95% CI, 43 to 73) in samples collected in universal transport medium and saline, respectively, compared to qPCR. Adding an up-front RNase inactivation step markedly improved the limit of detection to at least 25,000 copies/mL, with 87.5% (95% CI, 72 to 95) sensitivity and 100% specificity (95% CI, 87 to 100). Using both inactivation and purification increased the assay sensitivity by ten-fold, achieving a limit of detection comparable to commercial real-time PCR-based diagnostics. CONCLUSION: By incorporating a fast and inexpensive sample preparation step, RT-LAMP accurately detects SARS-CoV-2 with limited equipment for about US$6 per sample, making this a potentially ideal assay to increase testing capacity especially in resource-limited settings.","Anahtar, Melis N; McGrath, Graham E G; Rabe, Brian A; Tanner, Nathan A; White, Benjamin A; Lennerz, Jochen K M; Branda, John A; Cepko, Constance L; Rosenberg, Eric S",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7798487/,643
45463,Première vague de COVID-19: un retour d’expérience en clinique privée,2021-02-05,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae is extensively utilized for commercial fermentation, and is also an important biological model; however, its ecology has only recently begun to be understood. Through the use of whole-genome sequencing, the species has been characterized into a number of distinct subpopulations, defined by geographical ranges and industrial uses. Here, the whole-genome sequences of 104 New Zealand (NZ) S. cerevisiae strains, including 52 novel genomes, are analyzed alongside 450 published sequences derived from various global locations. The impact of S. cerevisiae novel range expansion into NZ was investigated and these analyses reveal the positioning of NZ strains as a subgroup to the predominantly European/wine clade. A number of genomic differences with the European group correlate with range expansion into NZ, including 18 highly enriched single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and novel Ty1/2 insertions. While it is not possible to categorically determine if any genetic differences are due to stochastic process or the operations of natural selection, we suggest that the observation of NZ-specific copy number increases of four sugar transporter genes in the HXT family may reasonably represent an adaptation in the NZ S. cerevisiae subpopulation, and this correlates with the observations of copy number changes during adaptation in small-scale experimental evolution studies.","Higgins, Peter; Grace, Cooper A; Lee, Soon A; Goddard, Matthew R",G3 (Bethesda),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7849907/,643

Nomophobia, the fear of being out of cellular contact, was typically assessed by self-report measures or proxy measures in adolescents and older adults. The goal of the current study was to examine nomophobia in late childhood and adolescence using scenario-based vignettes that are interactively presented and mediated by computers. To fulfill this goal, the Interactive Electronic Nomophobia Test (IENT), comprising of five scenario-based vignettes, was developed and administered to 1211 students aged between 10 and 18 years and enrolled in grades 5–12. The IENT psychometric properties were examined using a series of confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling. Additionally, the study examined the clustering nomophobia symptoms in a nationally representative sample of Omani students and explored the association of these Nomophobia symptoms with both students’ grade and gender. Results of the study provided evidence of the four-pronged structure of the IENT, and an overall all composite nomophobia score, with strong associations found among the subscales, and between each of the four subscales and Nomophobia composite score. Invariance tests found significantly different model results by gender in all cases. Finally, cluster analysis revealed two to three clusters, with significant associations between gender, class, and cluster type. Implications of the study are discussed in view of previous literature on the assessment of nomophobia and smartphone addiction.","Kazem, Ali Mahdi; Emam, Mahmoud Mohammed; Alrajhi, Marwa Nasser; Aldhafri, Said Sulaiman; AlBarashdi, Hafidha Sulaiman; Al-Rashdi, Bahia Abdullah",Trends in Psychol.,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7951125/,643

RECENT FINDINGS: Volatile anesthetics have been standard of care for general anesthesia for cardiac surgery, especially while using cardiopulmonary bypass. The 2019 published MYRIAD trial was not able to show a difference in mortality or cardiac biomarkers for volatile anesthetics compared to total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA), raising the question of equivalence with respect to patient outcome.

59393,Resilience.,2020-08-01,"In the last few years, microbial infection and innate immune theories have been proposed as an alternative approach explaining the etiopathogenesis and origin of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Lactoferrin, one of the main antimicrobial proteins in saliva, is an important modulator of immune response and inflammation, and represents an important defensive element by inducing a broad spectrum of antimicrobial effects against microbial infections. We demonstrated that lactoferrin levels in saliva are decreased in prodromal and dementia stages of AD compared with healthy subjects. That finding seems to be specific to cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) load as such observation was not observed in healthy elderly controls or those subjects with frontotemporal dementia. In the present study, we analysed salivary lactoferrin levels in a mouse model of AD. We observed robust and early reduction of lactoferrin levels in saliva from 6- and 12-month-old APP/PS1 mice. Because saliva is secreted by salivary glands, we presume that deregulation in salivary glands resulting in reduced salivary lactoferrin levels may occur in AD. To test this hypothesis, we collected submandibular glands from APP/PS1 mice, as well as submandibular gland tissue from AD patients and we analysed the expression levels of key components of the salivary protein signalling pathway. A significant reduction in M3 receptor levels was found along with decreased acetylcholine (Ach) levels in submandibular glands from APP/PS1 mice. Similarly, a reduction in M3 receptor levels was observed in human submandibular glands from AD patients but in that case, the Ach levels were found increased. Our data suggest that the ACh-mediated M3 signalling pathway is impaired in salivary glands in AD, resulting in salivary gland dysfunction and reduced salivary lactoferrin secretion.","Antequera, Desiree; Moneo, Diego; Carrero, Laura; Bartolome, Fernando; Ferrer, Isidro; Proctor, Gordon; Carro, Eva",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8514982/,643

61498,When will I have my surgery?,2020-12-01,"Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) is effective as a stand-alone bariatric procedure. Despite its positive effect with regard to weight loss and improvement of obesity-related co-morbidities, some patients develop gastroesophageal reflux symptoms postoperatively. The pathogenesis of these symptoms is not completely understood. Hence, this study aimed to assess the effect of sleeve gastrectomy on acid and non-acid gastroesophageal reflux, reflux symptoms and esophageal function. In a prospective study, patients underwent esophageal function tests (high-resolution manometry (HRM) and 24-h pH/impedance metry) before and 3 months after LSG. Preoperative and postoperative symptoms were assessed using the Reflux Disease Questionnaire (RDQ). In total, 20 patients (4 male/16 female, mean age 43 ± 12 years, mean weight 137.3 ± 25 kg, and mean BMI 47.6 ± 6.1 kg/m(2)) participated in this study. GERD symptoms did not significantly change after sleeve gastrectomy, but other upper gastrointestinal symptoms, particularly belching, epigastric pain and vomiting increased. Esophageal acid exposure significantly increased after sleeve gastrectomy: upright from 5.1 ± 4.4 to 12.6 ± 9.8% (p = 0.003), supine from 1.4 ± 2.4 to 11 ± 15% (p = 0.003) and total acid exposure from 4.1 ± 3.5 to 12 ± 10.4% (p = 0.004).

The lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure decreased from 18.3 ± 9.2 to 11.0 ± 7.0 mmHg (p = 0.02). After LSG, patients have significantly higher esophageal acid exposure, which may well be due to a decrease in LES resting pressure following the procedure.","Burgerhart, Jan S; Schotborgh, Charlotte A I; Schoon, Erik J; Smulders, Johannes F; van de Meeberg, Paul C; Siersema, Peter D; Smout, André J P M",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-014-1222-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24619293/,643

This article reviews recent literature and offers opinions on filter practices. IVC filtration is most likely to benefit patients at high risk of iatrogenic pulmonary embolus during endovenous intervention. Filters should be used selectively in patients with acute trauma or undergoing bariatric surgery. Retrieval should be attempted for perforating filter and fractured filter fragments when imaging suggests feasibility and favorable risk-to-benefit ratio. Antibiotic prophylaxis should be considered when removing filters with confirmed gastrointestinal penetration. Anticoagulation solely because of filter presence is not recommended except in patients with active malignancy. Anticoagulation while filters remain in place may decrease long-term filter complications in these patients. Patients with a filter and symptomatic IVC occlusion should be offered filter removal and IVC reconstruction. Physicians implanting filters may maximize retrieval by maintaining physician-patient relationships and scheduling follow-up at time of placement. Annual follow-up allows continued evaluation for removal or replacement appropriateness. Advanced retrieval techniques increase retrieval rates but require caution. Select cases may require referral to experienced centers with additional retrieval resources.

METHODS In this observational study, a 30 minutes respiration measurement was conducted by respiratory inductance plethysmography (RIP), the GC, and dEMG in stable preterm infants. Triggering was investigated with an in vitro set-up using the Infant Flow® SiPAPTM system. The possibility to optimize breath detection was tested by developing new algorithms with the abdominal RIP band (RIPAB ) as gold standard. In a subset of breaths, the delay time was calculated between the inspiratory onset in the RIPAB signal and in the GC and dEMG signal. RESULTS Fifteen preterm infants with a mean gestational age of 28 ± 2 weeks and a mean birth weight of 1086 ± 317 g were included. In total, 14 773 breaths were analyzed. Based on the GC and dEMG signal, the Infant Flow® SiPAP™ system, respectively, triggered 67.8% and 62.6% of the breaths. Breath detection was improved to 99.9% for the GC and 113.4% for dEMG in new algorithms. In 1492 stable breaths, the median delay time of inspiratory onset detection was +154 ms (IQR +118 to +164) in the GC and -50 ms (IQR -90 to -22) in the dEMG signal. CONCLUSION Breath detection using the GC can be improved by optimizing the algorithm. Transcutaneous dEMG provides similar breath detection but with the advantage of detecting the onset of inspiration earlier than the GC.","de Waal, Cornelia G; Kraaijenga, Juliette V; Hutten, Gerard J; de Jongh, Frans H; van Kaam, Anton H",Pediatric pulmonology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.23895; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29064171/,643

METHODS Pure laparoscopic subsegmentectomy of segment 6 (S6) was planned for a patient with HCC of S6 of the liver. The identification of the segment was performed by dye injection under percutaneous US guidance with artificial ascites. RESULTS The procedure was completed successfully in a minimally invasive manner with an operative time of 260 minutes and with intraoperative blood loss of 10 mL.

This survey aimed to explore the views of an ethnically diverse sample of HCPs in the UK about COVID-19-related deaths among HCPs in general and BAME HCPs in particular. METHODS It is a cross-sectional prospective survey of HCPs in UK and was conducted online using Google Forms between 28th April and 4th May 2020. FINDINGS A total of 1119 UK HCPs (aged 45.0 ± 9.5 years, 56% males, 71% BAME) participated. Seventy-two per cent of respondents reported being worried about COVID-19 and 84% had concerns about personal protective equipment (PPE). Almost all (93%) respondents felt that inadequate PPE may be a contributory factor to HCP deaths. Half of the respondents, especially younger and BAME, reported feeling unable to say 'no', if asked to work without adequate PPE. BAME HCPs were considered at a higher-risk of acquiring coronavirus and dying with COVID-19. Reasons for excess BAME HCP deaths were believed to be comorbidities, inadequate PPE and working in high-risk areas. Majority (81%) of respondents felt that the government has been slow to respond to COVID-19 related deaths in HCPs and 67% HCPs were of the opinion that BAME workers with risk factors should be removed from direct clinical care. INTERPRETATION HCPs have significant COVID-19-related concerns. BAME HCPs are considered at increased risk due to comorbidities, working in high-risk areas, and inadequate PPE. BAME HCP should have a thorough risk assessment and high-risk HCPs may need work adjustment or redeployment.

OBJECTIVE To characterize inpatient adaptations to care for non-ICU COVID-19 patients. DESIGN Cross-sectional survey. SETTING A network of 72 hospital medicine groups at US academic centers. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES COVID-19 testing, approaches to personal protective equipment (PPE), and features of respiratory isolation units (RIUs). RESULTS Fifty-one of 72 sites responded (71%) between April 3 and April 5, 2020. At the time of our survey, only 15 (30%) reported COVID-19 test results being available in less than 6 hours. Half of sites with PPE data available reported PPE stockpiles of 2 weeks or less. Nearly all sites (90%) reported implementation of RIUs. RIUs primarily utilized attending physicians, with few incorporating residents and none incorporating students. Isolation and room-entry policies focused on grouping care activities and utilizing technology (such as video visits) to communicate with and evaluate patients. The vast majority of sites reported decreases in frequency of in-room encounters across provider or team types. Forty-six percent of respondents reported initially unrecognized non-COVID-19 diagnoses in patients admitted for COVID-19 evaluation; a similar number reported delayed identification of COVID-19 in patients admitted for other reasons. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 pandemic has required medical wards to rapidly adapt with expanding use of RIUs and use of technology emerging as critical approaches. Reports of unrecognized or delayed diagnoses highlight how such adaptations may produce potential adverse effects on care.","Auerbach, Andrew; O'Leary, Kevin J; Greysen, S Ryan; Harrison, James D; Kripalani, Sunil; Ruhnke, Gregory W; Vasilevskis, Eduard E; Maselli, Judith; Fang, Margaret C; Herzig, Shoshana J; Lee, Tiffany",Journal of hospital medicine,https://doi.org/10.12788/jhm.3476; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32804610/,643

MATERIALS AND METHODS A phase I dose escalation study combining RFA with LTLD was performed with peri- and post- procedural CT and MRI. Imaging features were analyzed and measured in terms of ablative zone size and surrounding penumbra size. The dynamic imaging appearance was described qualitatively immediately following the procedure and at 1-month follow-up. The control group receiving liver RFA without LTLD was compared to the study group in terms of imaging features and post-ablative zone size dynamics at follow-up. RESULTS Post-treatment scans of hepatic lesions treated with RFA and LTLD have distinctive imaging characteristics when compared to those treated with RFA alone. The addition of LTLD resulted in a regular or smooth enhancing rim on T1W MRI which often correlated with increased attenuation on CT. The LTLD-treated ablation zones were stable or enlarged at follow-up four weeks later in 69% of study subjects as opposed to conventional RFA where the ablation zone underwent involution compared to imaging acquired immediately after the procedure. CONCLUSION The imaging features following RFA with LTLD were different from those after standard RFA and can mimic residual or recurrent tumor. Knowledge of the subtle findings between the two groups can help avoid misinterpretation and proper identification of treatment failure in this setting. Increased size of the LTLD-treated ablation zone after RFA suggests the ongoing drug-induced biological effects.,"Hong, Cheng William; Chow, Lucy; Turkbey, Evrim B; Lencioni, Riccardo; Libutti, Steven K; Wood, Bradford J",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00270-015-1186-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26228246/,643
87419,Proposal for radiologic diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19 in pregnant women.,2020-07-16,"INTRODUCTION Cholecystoenteric fistula (CEF) is rare in biliary tract surgery, and cholecystogastric fistula (CGF) is the rarest form of CEF. Although open cholecystectomy with the closure of the fistula is the gold standard treatment for nonobstructing biliary-enteric fistulas, the optimal treatment for CGF has not been established. Laparoscopic and endoscopic cooperative surgery (LECS), a minimally invasive surgery for gastric submucosal tumors, reportedly helps achieve favorable postoperative outcomes. This report presents a case wherein CGF was treated with LECS. CASE PRESENTATION An-84-year-old man with a history of chemotherapy for ileocecal diffuse large B cell lymphoma presented with fever and abdominal pain. He was diagnosed with cholangitis, and endoscopic lithotripsy was performed. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography revealed gastric wall thickening close to the gallbladder, indicating a malignant lymphoma. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy revealed a concavity on the anterior wall of the antrum of the stomach. Direct endoscopic cholangiography, which was performed by the injection of a contrast medium into the concavity, confirmed the concavity to be a CGF. Cholecystectomy with the closure of the fistula using the LECS was performed to check for suture line leakage and the positional relation of the suture line and the pylorus. The resected specimen showed acute and chronic cholecystitis without malignancy. The patient did not experience postoperative complications in the subsequent 3 months. DISCUSSION Resection and closure of the fistula using LECS were performed successfully. CONCLUSION LECS can be performed for CGF. LECS enables intraoperative observation of the fistula and suture line, and thus reduces postoperative complications.","Fujimoto, Goshi",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2020.04.100; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32446989/,643
90588,"Causes and characteristics of uveitis cases at a reference university hospital in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.",2021-09-10,"Biliary atresia (BA) is a destructive cholangiopathy of childhood in which Th1 immunity has been mechanistically linked to the bile duct inflammation and obstruction that culminate in liver injury. Based on reports of decreased Th1 cytokines in some patients and the development of BA in mice lacking CD4+ T cells, we hypothesized that Th1-independent mechanisms can also activate effector cells and induce BA. Here, we tested this hypothesis using Stat1-/- mice, which lack the ability to mount Th1 immune responses. Infection of Stat1-/- mice with rhesus rotavirus type A (RRV) on postnatal day 1 induced a prominent Th2 response, duct epithelial injury and obstruction within 7 days, and atresia shortly thereafter. A high degree of phosphorylation of the Th2 transcription factor Stat6 was observed; however, concurrent inactivation of Stat1 and Stat6 in mice did not prevent BA after RRV infection. In contrast, depletion of macrophages or combined loss of Il13 and Stat1 reduced tissue infiltration by lymphocytes and myeloid cells, maintained epithelial integrity, and prevented duct obstruction. In concordance with our mouse model, humans at the time of BA diagnosis exhibited differential hepatic expression of Th2 genes and serum Th2 cytokines. These findings demonstrate compatibility between Th2 commitment and the pathogenesis of BA, and suggest that patient subgrouping in future clinical trials should account for differences in Th2 status.","Li, Jun; Bessho, Kazuhiko; Shivakumar, Pranavkumar; Mourya, Reena; Mohanty, Sujit Kumar; Dos Santos, Jorge L; Miura, Irene K; Porta, Gilda; Bezerra, Jorge A",The Journal of clinical investigation,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci57728; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22005305/,643

This study aimed to explore the correlates of fatigue amongst a number of clinical parameters in patients with chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), in order to better understand potential contributing factors and resulting consequences. METHODS Twenty-six clinically stable CIDP patients underwent assessments of motor and sensory function, disability, quality of life and depression and anxiety. Experienced fatigue was assessed using the Rasch-built fatigue severity scale and Checklist of Individual Strength. RESULTS The two utilized fatigue scales showed significant inter-correlation. Only depression scores and grip strength predicted experienced fatigue levels in multivariate regression analyses. Fatigue scores inversely correlated with strength, sensory, disability and quality of life scores. DISCUSSION Experienced fatigue is likely multifactorial in CIDP, with both physical and neuropsychiatric components. Fatigue is associated with lower functional and quality-of-life outcomes in CIDP.

We surveyed 904 patients receiving injections at 5 centres in France regarding their feelings toward anti-VEGF injections. The mean age was 77.4 years, and the injections were performed mostly for age related macular degeneration (72%). Half of the patients had previously received>10 injections, 35.6% had received 3-10 injections, and 14.2% had received<3 injections. The mean (SD) stress score was 4.2 [on a scale from 1-10 (0=least stressful, 10=extremely stressful)]. Most patients (70%) reported low to moderate stress (score ≤5). The number of previous injections did not influence stress scores. Paradoxically, 61.2% of patients reported finding injections to be less stressful over time. Most patients found injections to be less traumatic than expected (64%) or just as they had anticipated (25%). Most patients (88%) were not bothered by the presence of other patients in the waiting room. Most patients (78.8%) preferred to be injected quickly before they had time to feel stressed about the procedure. Injections were generally well accepted; most patients would prefer to maintain their current schedule of injections and their current vision (55.7%), or would be willing to have more frequent injections for better vision (39.5%). Our results suggest that stress appears to be more related to the patient's psychological make-up than to the treatment experience or the number of injections received.","Gualino, V; Fourmaux, E; Grenet, T; Zerbib, J; Wolff, B",Journal francais d'ophtalmologie,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfo.2020.02.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004191/,643

Counter-Terrorism Medicine (CTM) addresses unique terrorism-related issues relating to the mitigation, preparedness, and response measures to asymmetric, multi-modality terrorist attacks. This study is an epidemiological examination of all terrorism-related events sustained from 1970-2019, analyzing historical weapon types used and the resulting fatal injuries (FI) and non-fatal injuries (NFI) sustained. METHODS The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) was searched for all attacks from 1970-2019. Attacks met inclusion criteria if they fulfilled the three terrorism-related criteria, as set by the GTD codebook. Ambiguous events were excluded. State-sponsored terrorist events do not meet the codebook's definition, and as such, are excluded from the study. Available counts of FI and NFI in each incident were then sorted and aggregated by weapon type to enable mean and standard deviation calculations. RESULTS In total, 168,003 events were recorded from the years 1970-2019. Explosives, bombs, and/or dynamite (E/B/D) were the most commonly used weapon type and accounted for 48.78% of all terrorism events, followed by the use of firearms in 26.77% of events. A total of 339,435 FI and 496,225 NFI resulted from all terrorism events that occurred during the study period. Combined, E/B/D and firearms accounted for 75.55% of all events, 67.1% of all FI, and 79.3% of all NFI. Each individual terrorism event inflicted a mean FI rate of 2.14 FI per event (SD = 10.2) and a mean NFI rate of 3.22 NFI per event (SD = 45.19). CONCLUSIONS Although terrorism is complex and does not solely rely on death tolls as a measure of success, this analysis shows a historic mean FI rate of 2.14 and NFI rate of 3.22 per event over the past 50 years. Proven weapons such as E/B/D and firearms combine to account for over 75% of weapon types used in all events. Use of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) such as chemical, biological, radiation, and nuclear (CBRN) weapons has been rare (0.2%), yet has extreme high potential to inflict mass casualties with mean NFI rates of 49.62 and 28.75 for chemical and biological weapons, respectively.","Tin, Derrick; Margus, Colton; Ciottone, Gregory R",Prehospital and disaster medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1049023x21000868; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34392864/,643

BACKGROUND SVGs are prone to develop atherosclerosis similar to native coronary arteries. They have received little study using NIRS. METHODS We examined the clinical characteristics and imaging findings from 43 patients who underwent NIRS imaging of 45 SVGs at our institution between 2009 and 2016. RESULTS The mean patient age was 67 ± 7 years and 98% were men, with high prevalence of diabetes mellitus (56%), hypertension (95%), and dyslipidemia (95%). Mean SVG age was 7 ± 7 years, mean SVG lipid core burden index (LCBI) was 53 ± 60 and mean maxLCBI4 mm was 194 ± 234. Twelve SVGs (27%) had lipid core plaques (2 yellow blocks on the block chemogram), with a higher prevalence in SVGs older than 5 years (46% vs. 5%, P = 0.002). Older SVG age was associated with higher LCBI (r = 0.480, P < 0.001) and higher maxLCBI4 mm (r = 0.567, P < 0.001). On univariate analysis, greater annual total cholesterol exposure was associated with higher SVG LCBI (r = 0.30, P = 0.042) and annual LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride exposure were associated with higher SVG maxLCBI4 mm (LDL-C: r = 0.41, P = 0.020; triglycerides: r = 0.36, P = 0.043). On multivariate analysis, the only independent predictor of SVG LCBI and maxLCBI4mm was SVG age. SVG percutaneous coronary intervention was performed in 63% of the patients. An embolic protection device was used in 96% of SVG PCIs. Periprocedural myocardial infarction occurred in one patient.

SETTING/PARTICIPANTS The first 60 inpatients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, referred to the hospital palliative care service between 1 March 2020 and 23 April 2020, and another 60 inpatients, referred to the hospital palliative care service between 11 March 2019 and 23 April 2019, were included from a district general hospital in East London, UK. RESULTS Patients with COVID-19 have lower comorbidity scores, poorer performance status, and a shorter time from referral to death compared to patients without COVID-19. Breathlessness, drowsiness, agitation, and fever are the most prevalent symptoms during COVID-19 compared to pain and drowsiness pre-COVID-19. Time from admission to referral to palliative care is longer for Black, Asian and minority ethnic patients, especially during COVID-19. CONCLUSION Early referral to palliative care is essential in COVID-19, especially for Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups. There is urgent need to research why Black, Asian and minority ethnic patients are referred late; how palliative care services have changed; and possible solutions to setting up responsive, flexible, and integrated services.","Chidiac, Claude; Feuer, David; Flatley, Mary; Rodgerson, Anna; Grayson, Kate; Preston, Nancy",Palliative medicine,https://doi.org/10.1177/0269216320946688; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32736485/,643
125534,Smartphone as a tool for evaluating oblique muscle dysfunction.,2021-09-10,"Inevitably, along with other healthcare specializations, pediatric surgery was affected by the Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic. Children were reported to manifest mild to moderate symptoms and mortality was primarily observed in patients aged <1 year and having underlying comorbidities. The majority of the cases were asymptomatic in children, hence, posing a challenge for pediatric surgery centers to take drastic measures to reduce the virus transmission. Telemedicine was introduced and outpatient consultations were conducted online as out-patient clinics were closed. Elective surgeries were postponed with delayed appointments while the healthcare sector was diverted towards tackling COVID-19. Case urgency was classified and triaged, leading to limited surgeries being performed only in COVID-19 negative patients following an extensive screening process. The screening process consisted of online history taking and RT-PCR tests. Newer practices such as mouth rinse, video laryngoscopy, and anesthesia were introduced to restrict patients from crying, coughing, and sneezing, as an attempt to avoid aerosolization of viral particles and safely conduct pediatric surgeries during the pandemic. Surgical trainees were also affected as the smaller number of surgeries conducted reduced the clinical experience available to medical enthusiasts. There is still room for advanced practices to be introduced in pediatric surgery, and restore all kinds of surgeries to improve the quality of life of the patient.","Yasmin, Farah; Bin Zafar, Muhammad D; Salman, Ariba; Farooque, Umar; Asghar, Muhammad S; Khan, Anosh A; Mohiuddin, Osama; Hassan, Syed A",Minerva pediatrics,https://doi.org/10.23736/s2724-5276.21.06146-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33845565/,643

However, the risk of secondary malignant neoplasms (SMNs) in DLBCL survivors with different primary extranodal sites are unknown. METHODS A total of 40,714 patients diagnosed with stage I/II DLBCL were included from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database from 1983 to 2015.The standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and absolute excess risk (AER) were used to assess the risk of SMNs. RESULTS The results show that the risk of SMN was significantly higher in extranodal DLBCL than in the US general population (SIR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.11-1.26), and the risk of developing SMN remains significantly elevated with increased latency. Moreover, there were multiple site-specific risk patterns. There was a 22%, 44%, 66%, 123% and 151% increased risk of SMN 10 years after primary gastrointestinal tract, head/neck, skeletal, lung and liver/pancreas DLBCL diagnosis, respectively. There was a significant decrease risk of SMN with increasing age at diagnosis for primary gastrointestinal tract and skeletal DLBCL. In addition, DLBCL patients with primary sites in the gastrointestinal tract, thyroid and liver/pancreas had the highest incidences of secondary stomach cancer, second thyroid cancer, and second hepatobiliary cancer, respectively, which indicated that the initial site of DLBCL may predict the type of SMN. CONCLUSIONS The strategies for cancer surveillance after extranodal DLBCL diagnosis may need to be individualized according to the subsite of extranodal DLBCL.","Yin, Xuejiao; Xu, Aoshuang; Huang, Zhenli; Fan, Fengjuan; Wang, Yajun; Chen, Lei; Cui, Guohui; Hu, Yu; Sun, Chunyan",Translational oncology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranon.2021.101106; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33932917/,643

Herein, we develop an ingenious green strategy to achieve the partial reduction of Eu3+ to Eu2+ ions in the complex of pyrenol-containing cyclen (H4(Pyr)4cyclen, H4[PC]) via a ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) effect in air at room temperature. To reveal the inherent regulated capacity of the Eu2+/3+ complex in catalysis, we prepared the nanocomposites assembled by the lanthanide complexes encapsulated into ZIF-67 to successively realize the decomposition of H2O2, including europium, gadolinium, and terbium complexes. Among the nanocomposites, Eu2+/3+[PC]H@ZIF-67 exhibits the best catalytic performance due to the achievement of dual regulation of Co3+/Co2+ ratio by the mixed-valent complex. Because of extremely abundant Co2+ active sites, the Eu2+/3+[PC]H@ZIF-67 after catalyzing H2O2 sample was further utilized to degrade organic dye rhodamine B (RhB). The rather outstanding catalytic degradation efficiency was still present in Eu2+/3+[PC]H@ZIF-67. This research presents a facile strategy of Eu3+ reduction based on the ligand design and a new direction for the future development of the composite catalytic materials with mixed-valent complexes.","Zhao, Zhongli; Shan, Changfu; Zhou, Panpan; Cao, Jing; Liu, Weisheng; Tang, Yu",Inorganic chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.inorgchem.0c01447; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32941032/,643

After LRYGB, the endoscopic access to the gastric remnant and pancreaticobiliary system is challenging. The laparoscopic gastric bypass with fundectomy and exploration of the gastric remnant (LRYGBfse) was introduced in an attempt to overcome this limitation. The purpose of this study was to analyze the medium-term outcomes and safety of LRYGBfse. METHODS Observational prospective single-arm multicenter cohort study. Patients with BMI > 35 kg/m2 were included. Previous open abdominal surgery was an exclusion criterion. Postoperative 1, 2, 3, and 5-year weight loss, BMI decrease, and percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) were recorded. Wilcoxon signed rank sum test was used for paired data. RESULTS Among 653 enrolled patients, 229 completed the 5-year follow-up. Preoperative median body weight (kg) and BMI (kg/m2) were 133.4 kg (interquartile range (IQR) = 12.0) and 48.2 kg/m2 (IQR = 10.1), respectively. Median 5-year body weight, BMI, and %EWL were 83.7 (IQR = 17.3), 31.2 (IQR = 7.7), and 74.8 (IQR = 23.4), respectively, all significantly improved compared to baseline (p = 0.002, p = 0.001, and p = 0.012, respectively). Comorbid improvement or resolution was observed in 88% of the patients. No major intraoperative complications were reported. Postoperative overall morbidity and mortality rates were 1 and 0%, respectively. Banding removal was necessary in one patient 62 months after the index operation. CONCLUSIONS The LRYGBfse seems safe and effective with durable results at 5-year follow-up. Endoscopic exploration of the gastric remnant is an additional valuable tool.","Lesti, Giovanni; Aiolfi, Alberto; Mozzi, Enrico; Altorio, Fabrizio; Lattuada, Ezio; Lesti, Francesco; Bonitta, Gianluca; Zappa, Marco Antonio",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-018-3220-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29623665/,643

To facilitate development of novel therapeutic interventions with the potential to control disease progression, there is a need to establish translational animal models that predict treatment effects in human DKD. The present study aimed to characterize renal disease and outcomes of standard of medical care in a mouse model of advanced DKD facilitated by adeno-associated virus (AAV)-mediated renin overexpression in uninephrectomized (UNx) db/db mice. Five weeks after single AAV administration and four weeks after UNx, female db/db UNx-ReninAAV mice received (PO, QD) vehicle, lisinopril (40 mg/kg), empagliflozin (20 mg/kg) or combination treatment for 12 weeks (n=17 per group). Untreated db/+ mice (n=8) and vehicle-dosed db/db UNx-LacZAAV mice (n=17) served as controls. Endpoints included plasma, urine and histomorphometric markers of kidney disease. Total glomerular numbers and individual glomerular volume was evaluated by whole-kidney 3D imaging analysis. db/db UNx-ReninAAV mice developed hallmarks of progressive DKD characterized by severe albuminuria, advanced glomerulosclerosis and glomerular hypertrophy. Lisinopril significantly improved albuminuria, glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial injury and inflammation. While empagliflozin alone had no therapeutic effect on renal endpoints, lisinopril and empagliflozin exerted synergistic effects on renal outcomes. In conclusion, the db/db UNx-ReninAAV mouse demonstrates good clinical translatability with respect to the physiological and histological hallmarks of progressive DKD. Efficacy of standard of care to control hypertension and hyperglycemia provides proof-of-concept for testing novel drug therapies in the model.","Østergaard, Mette Viberg; Secher, Thomas; Christensen, Michael; Salinas, Casper Gravesen; Roostalu, Urmas; Skytte, Jacob Lercke; Rune, Ida; Hansen, Henrik H; Jelsing, Jacob; Vrang, Niels; Fink, Lisbeth Nielsen",American journal of physiology.

An Egyptian experience.,2020-06-30,"The etiology of multiple sclerosis is, at present, not definitely known, but genetic and environmental factors play a role in its causation. Environmental causes have a predominant impact. Epidemiologic research has contributed considerably to the identification of external risk factors in this multifactorial setting, but methodological constraints still play a major part. Viral and other microbial agents have drawn much attention, although none of them is a necessary condition for the disease. This is true also for the Epstein-Barr virus, for which most data, including prospective data, supports a role in the majority of multiple sclerosis patients. In parallel, the hypothesis is still attractive in that it is not the virus per se, but rather more the age when it infects the human being that is the crucial matter. Other risk factors, such as tobacco smoking and vitamin D deficiency, which have immunomodulating properties, may also play some role, although the latter is not compatible with all data of the descriptive epidmiology of multiple sclerosis. Diet might be of considerable importance, all the more since multiple sclerosis can be ecologically attributed to a certain food patterns and is inversely associated with others (e.g., the 'Mediterranean diet'). The hypothesis that the preservation of meat by nitrite and wood smoke plays a role, and the protective influence of a fish and, possibly, a vegetable diet, are supported by some studies, but methodological constraints limit, at present, definite conclusions. A new avenue is the search for an interaction between genetic and environmental causes, and also between several environmental factors that might lead to new approaches for prevention and, perhaps, for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.","Lauer, Klaus",Expert review of neurotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1586/ern.10.7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20187864/,643

It has been assumed that the strength and the endurance of trunk flexor and extensor muscles are CLPB key factors, but it is not known whether these attributes are related to pain intensity. It was aimed to determine whether the strength and endurance of trunk flexor and extensor muscles differ in MPO with no pain (CON; n = 24), moderate (MOD; n = 42), and severe (SEV; n = 37) nonspecific chronic low back pain (CLBP). Methods: The peak torque and endurance test of trunk flexor (PTF.BM-1) and extensor (PTE.BM-1) muscles were compared. A multiple regression analysis was used to identify pain intensity predictors in all groups (PAIN) and according to pain intensity (MOD and SEV). Results: The PTF.BM-1 was negatively related to pain and was a significant predictor, irrespective of pain intensity (PAIN). Conclusion: When pain intensity was considered the PTF.BM-1 and PTE.BM-1 explained the pain in the MOD, while the PTE.BM-1 and service time explained pain intensity in the SEV. Endurance of the flexor and extensor muscles was not related to pain intensity. These results indicated that training protocols must emphasize specific strengthening routines.","Tavares, Janny M A; Rodacki, André L F; Hoflinger, Francielle; Dos Santos Cabral, Alexandre; Paulo, Anderson C; Rodacki, Cintia L N",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17176434; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899413/,643

We sought to estimate and compare the COVID-19 CFR in Canada and the United States while adjusting for 2 potential biases in crude CFR. METHODS We used the daily incidence of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths in Canada and the US from Jan. 31 to Apr. 22, 2020. We applied a statistical method to minimize bias in the crude CFR by accounting for the survival interval as the lag time between disease onset and death, while considering reporting rates of COVID-19 cases less than 50% (95% confidence interval 10%-50%). RESULTS Using data for confirmed cases in Canada, we estimated the crude CFR to be 4.9% on Apr. 22, 2020, and the adjusted CFR to be 5.5% (credible interval [CrI] 4.9%-6.4%). After we accounted for various reporting rates less than 50%, the adjusted CFR was estimated at 1.6% (CrI 0.7%-3.1%). The US crude CFR was estimated to be 5.4% on Apr. 20, 2020, with an adjusted CFR of 6.1% (CrI 5.4%-6.9%). With reporting rates of less than 50%, the adjusted CFR for the US was 1.78 (CrI 0.8%-3.6%). INTERPRETATION Our estimates suggest that, if the reporting rate is less than 50%, the adjusted CFR of COVID-19 in Canada is likely to be less than 2%. The CFR estimates for the US were higher than those for Canada, but the adjusted CFR still remained below 2%.

We collected 27 melanotic Xp11 neoplasms, the largest series to date, for a comprehensive evaluation. Fourteen of the cases, along with 8 alveolar soft part sarcomas (ASPS), 9 conventional PEComas, and a control group of 7 normal tissues were submitted to RNA sequencing. Follow-up available in 22 patients showed 5-year overall survival (OS) and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) of 47.6 and 35.7% respectively, which were similar to ASPS and significantly worse than conventional PEComa. Univariate analysis of location (occurring in the kidney versus not kidney), infiltrative growth pattern, nuclear pleomorphism, mitotic activity ≥2/50 HPF, necrosis, and lymphovascular invasion were found to be associated with OS and/or DFS. Multivariate analysis identified that location was the only factor found to independently correlate with DFS. More importantly, RNA sequencing-based clustering analysis segregated melanotic Xp11 neoplasm and ASPS, clearly from other tumors including conventional PEComa and Xp11 translocation renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and formed a compact cluster representative of the largely similar expression signature. In this study, we first clearly define the true biologic nature that melanotic Xp11 neoplasms are distinctive malignant mesenchymal tumors, rather than simply PEComa variants with occasionally unpredictable behavior. Meanwhile, melanotic Xp11 neoplasm and ASPS more likely represent phenotypic variants of the same entity, which is distinct from conventional PEComa and Xp11 translocation RCC. Based on these important findings, melanotic Xp11 neoplasm might be reclassified into a distinctive entity together with ASPS, independent from PEComa, in the future revisions of the current World Health Organization categories of tumors of soft tissue and bone for the improved reclassification.

The peritoneal closure after mesh placement can be performed in various ways. In any case, thorough closure is recommended to avoid mesh exposure to the viscera with the risk of adhesions and bowel incarceration into peritoneal defects. Postoperative intestinal obstructions can mainly occur due to adhesions or bowel herniation through peritoneal defects into the dissected preperitoneal space. Incarcerations can also occur as a consequence of trocar site herniation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION Recently barbed self-anchoring knotless suturing devices are frequently used for peritoneal closure. The correct handling of such sutures is crucial to avoid potential complications. Despite of accurate management, bowel adherence and injuries or volvulus can occur. METHODS We present an unusual case of a postoperative small bowel obstruction owing to strained adhesions and ingrowth between a small bowel segment and a polyglyconate unidirectional self-anchoring barbed suture device.

To reduce energy demand, China has implemented an energy cap policy and pledged to limit total energy consumption to around 5000 million tons of standard coal equivalent by 2020 in the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020). The prospect of achieving this target relies on the understanding of China's energy growth pattern. To this end, we investigate the transformation of the growth pattern in China's energy consumption from 2005 to 2015. We combine environmental input-output approach and structural decomposition analysis to study the factors that influence the changes in China's energy consumption. Results show that energy consumption growth shifted from export-driven before the Financial Crisis (2005-2007) to investment-driven during the Financial Crisis (2007-2010) and to consumption-driven both in the Economic Recovery (2010-2012) and in the New Normal (2012-2015). Consumption volume was the major promoting factor of the growth in energy consumption, but it became less important over time. In contrast, energy intensity was the primary factor offsetting energy consumption growth, with varying contribution over the period 2005-2015. Correspondingly, we further discuss how relevant policies for each period contribute to shaping the growth pattern and give recommendations for energy policymakers.","Guang, Fengtao; Wen, Le",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09206-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418106/,643

Whether telomere injury induces mitochondrial dysfunction in human T lymphocytes, the major component of adaptive host immunity against infection and malignancy, remains unclear. We have recently shown that disruption of telomere integrity by KML001, a telomere-targeting drug, induces T cell senescence and apoptosis via the telomeric DNA damage response (DDR). In this study, we used KML001 to further investigate the role and mechanism of telomere injury in mitochondrial dysregulation in aging T cells. We demonstrate that targeting telomeres by KML001 induces mitochondrial dysfunction, as evidenced by increased mitochondrial swelling and decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, oxidative phosphorylation, mitochondrial DNA content, mitochondrial respiration, oxygen consumption, glycolysis, and ATP energy production. Mechanistically, we found that the KML001-induced telomeric DDR activated p53 signaling, which in turn repressed the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1 alpha (PGC-1α) and nuclear respiratory factor 1 (NRF-1), leading to T cell mitochondrial dysfunction. These results, forging a direct link between telomeric and mitochondrial biology, shed new light on the human T cell aging network, and demonstrate that the p53-PGC-1α-NRF-1 axis contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction in the setting of telomeric DDR. This study suggests that targeting this axis may offer an alternative, novel approach to prevent telomere damage-mediated mitochondrial and T cell dysfunctions to combat a wide range of immune aging-associated human diseases.","Schank, Madison; Zhao, Juan; Wang, Ling; Li, Zhengke; Cao, Dechao; Nguyen, Lam Nhat; Dang, Xindi; Khanal, Sushant; Nguyen, Lam Ngoc Thao; Thakuri, Bal Krishna Chand; Ogbu, Stella C; Lu, Zeyuan; Zhang, Jinyu; Wu, Xiao Y; Morrison, Zheng D; El Gazzar, Mohamed; Ning, Shunbin; Moorman, Jonathan P; Yao, Zhi Q",Cell death & disease,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41419-020-03238-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33268822/,643

Here, we report that the M2 gene is a determinant of reovirus myocarditis. The reovirus M2 gene encodes outer capsid protein μ1, which influences both cell entry and cell death. We infected newborn C57BL/6 mice with reovirus strain type 1 Lang (T1L) or a reassortant reovirus in which the M2 gene from strain type 3 Dearing (T3D) was substituted into the T1L genetic background (T1L/T3DM2). T1L was non-lethal in wild-type mice, whereas greater than 90% of mice succumbed to T1L/T3DM2 infection. T1L/T3DM2 produced higher viral loads than T1L at the site of inoculation. In secondary organs, T1L/T3DM2 was detected with more rapid kinetics and reached higher peak titers than T1L. We found that hearts from T1L/T3DM2-infected mice were grossly abnormal, with large lesions corresponding to substantial cardiac injury with inflammatory infiltrates. Lesions in T1L/T3DM2-infected mice contained aggregates of necrotic cardiomyocytes with pyknotic debris, and prominent lymphocyte and histiocyte infiltration. In contrast, T1L induced the formation of smaller lesions in a subset of animals, consistent with T1L being mildly myocarditic. Finally, more activated caspase-3-positive cells were observed in hearts from animals infected with T1L/T3DM2 compared to T1L. Together, our findings indicate that substitution of the T3D M2 allele into an otherwise T1L genetic background is sufficient to change a non-lethal infection into a lethal infection. Our results further indicate that T3D M2 enhances T1L replication and dissemination in vivo, which potentiates the capacity of reovirus to cause myocarditis. IMPORTANCE Reovirus is a non-enveloped virus with a segmented double-stranded RNA genome that serves as a model for studying virus-induced injury to the heart. However, the mechanisms by which reovirus affects heart disease are not fully elucidated. We found that substituting a single gene from reovirus strain type 3 Dearing (T3D) into an otherwise type 1 Lang (T1L) genetic background (T1L/T3DM2) was sufficient to convert the non-lethal T1L strain into a lethal infection in neonatal mice. In comparison to T1L, T1L/T3DM2 reached distal organs such as the heart more efficiently. Furthermore, it replicated to higher levels at those sites. Hearts from mice infected with T1L resulted in limited recruitment of immune cells. In contrast, hearts from mice infected with T1L/T3DM2 contained substantially more immune cell invasion and cell death. Together, our findings identify the reovirus M2 gene as a new determinant of reovirus induced heart disease.","Dina Zita, Marcelle; Phillips, Matthew B.; Stuart, Johnasha D.; Kumarapeli, Asangi R.; Sridharan, Vijayalakshmi; Boerma, Marjan; Snyder, Anthony J.; Danthi, Pranav; Boehme, Karl W.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.16.452757,643

Design/methodology/approach: The changes in cyberattacks of the health-care sector are analyzed by examination of the number and essence of published news concerning cybersecurity attacks on the health-care sector during 2019 and compared them to those published during 2020, based on two main websites, which review such incidents. Findings: This study found that there was a significant growth in reports of cyberattacks on the health-care sector. Moreover, the number of cyberattacks fit interestingly to the pattern of waves of the disease, which expanded worldwide. During the first wave the number of reports was doubled or even tripled, compared to the same period in 2019, a tendency that was slightly waned afterwards. Practical implications: This study helps to deepen the awareness of information security implications of a potential global devastating crisis, even in the cybersecurity domain, and on the health-care sector, among various other affected sectors and domains. Social implications: COVID-19 pandemic created long-term wide-range changes that affect every individual and sector, mainly owing to the shift to remote working model, which impose long-term new cybersecurity changes, among them to the health-care industry. Originality/value: This paper extends the existing information on implication of remote working model on information security and of the COVID-19 pandemic on the cybersecurity of health-care institutions around the world. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Gafni, R.; Pavel, T.",Information and Computer Security,https://doi.org/10.1108/ics-05-2021-0059,643
171275,Bhutan: The role of the constitutional monarch in a public health crisis,2021,"Clinical trials and drug discovery would not be effective without the collaboration of institutions. Earlier, it has been at the cost of individual's privacy. Several pacts and compliances have been enforced to avoid data breaches. The existing schemes collect the participant's data to a central repository for learning predictions as the collaboration is indispensable for research advances. The current COVID pandemic has put a question mark on our existing setup where the existing data repository has proved to be obsolete. There is a need for contemporary data collection, processing, and learning. The smartphones and devices held by the last person of the society have also made them a potential contributor. It demands to design a distributed and decentralized Collaborative Learning system that would make the knowledge inference from every data point. Federated Learning [21], proposed by Google, brings the concept of in-place model training by keeping the data intact to the device. Though it is privacy-preserving in nature, however, it is susceptible to inference, poisoning, and Sybil attacks. Blockchain is a decentralized programming paradigm that provides a broader control of the system, making it attack resistant. It poses challenges of high computing power, storage, and latency. These emerging technologies can contribute to the desired learning system and motivate them to address their security and efficiency issues. This article systematizes the security issues in Federated Learning, its corresponding mitigation strategies, and Blockchain's challenges. Further, a Blockchain-based Federated Learning architecture with two layers of participation is presented, which improves the global model accuracy and guarantees participant's privacy. It leverages the channel mechanism of Blockchain for parallel model training and distribution. It facilitates establishing decentralized trust between the participants and the gateways using the Blockchain, which helps to have only honest participants. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.","Kasyap, H.; Tripathy, S.","ACM Transactions on Multimedia Computing, Communications and Applications",https://doi.org/10.1145/3426474,643

In Saudi Arabia, the Ministry of Health called for citizens and residents to take up the vaccine as an essential step to return life to normal. However, the take-up calls were made in the face of profound disagreements on social media platforms and online networks about the value and efficacy of the vaccines. Thus, this study seeks to explore the responses of Saudi citizens to the COVID-19 vaccines and their sentiments about being vaccinated using opinion mining methods to analyze data extracted from Twitter, the most widely used social media network in Saudi Arabia. A corpus of 37,467 tweets was built. Vector space classification (VSC) methods were used to group and categorize the selected tweets based on their linguistic content, classifying the attitudes and responses of the users into three defined categories: positive, negative, and neutral. The lexical semantic properties of the posts show a prevalence of negative responses. This indicates that health departments need to ensure citizens are equipped with accurate, evidence-based information and key facts about the COVID-19 vaccines to help them make appropriate decisions when it comes to being vaccinated. Although the study is limited to the analysis of attitudes of people to the COVID-19 vaccines in Saudi Arabia, it has clear implications for the application of opinion mining using computational linguistic methods in Arabic. © 2021","Alliheibi, F.

Objectives: Our aim was to evaluate in a cohort of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) patients treated with JAK-inhibitors (JAKi): the self-assessed disease activity during lockdown, the lockdown impact on fatigue, anxiety, depression and the prevalence of Covid-19. Methods: We enrolled RA patients treated with baricitinib or tofacitinib. At baseline (BL) and follow-up we collected: patients' demographic data, composite disease activity indices (CDAI, DAS28CRP), global assessment (PGA), pain visual analogue scale (VAS), FACIT (functional assessment of chronic illness therapy) and a self-rating scale for disease impact on anxiety and depression (Zung-A/D). Patients were instructed on how to perform self-assessment through video-material and fulfilled the online form of Rheumatoid Arthritis Impact of Disease (RAID)1 and RA Disease Activity Index (RADAI). To capture the pandemic effect, we compared patients in different status (remission, low, moderate and high-disease activity) at the last in-person visit (preCoV) through the DAS28CRP and CDAI, to the tele-health visit (THV), measured by the RAID. BL and pre-CoV ZUNG-A, ZUNG-D, FACIT questionnaires were compared with the online results during the pandemic. Exposure, tests and symptoms of Covid-19 were recorded. Data were expressed as mean±standard deviation or median(IQR) according to distribution. Results: Twenty patients (median age 58.2±11.9 and mean disease duration 153.5 ± 112.7 months) were treated with tofacitinib and 27 with baricitinib. The median time-lapse between the pre-CoV visit and the THV was 12 (IQR 4) weeks. DAS28CRP and CDAI significantly decreased from BL to pre-CoV visit. During the last in-person visit, 21 patients (48.83%) were in remission, 9 (20.93%) in low disease activity;according to the RAID, 15 (31.91%) and 7 (14.89%) patients were respectively in remission and low disease activity during the THV (Table A). PGA and pain significantly decreased from BL to pre-Cov visit but worsened during the lockdown (Table A). FACIT remaining stable during THV. At THV, we detected a significant improvement of anxiety from BL (Zung-A) and a tendency to lower depression scores compared to BL (Table A). JAKi showed a good safety profile considering Covid-19 symptoms, none of the patients was diagnosed with SarsCoV2 infection. Conclusion: This is the first study on virtual assessment in RA patients treated with JAKi. The unique social experiment of the pandemic impaired the clinical response already achieved before the lockdown, without a collateral worseling of FACIT, anxiety and depression.","Garufi, C.; Spinelli, F.

The paper aims to provide a case study of a real estate project by giving insight into the Latvian real estate project that had been experiencing similar economic uncertainty, to demonstrate hybrid real options valuation (ROV) method to adapt real estate investments to changing circumstances and to develop the decision-making solution to similar EU real estate problems during the pandemic. The paper provides the ""step-by-step"" ROV application's methodology in real estate development projects. The presented methodology is a powerful managerial risk management tool for the executives of similar real estate development projects in the EU countries struggling to make investment decisions in the pandemic and post-pandemic period.

We measured vaccination coverage as the percent of the total population fully vaccinated as of July 15, 2021, with the exception of 11 Texas counties, where the cutoff date was July 14, 2021. We measured COVID-19 incidence as the number of confirmed cases per 100,000 population during the 14-day period ending August 12, 2021. We measured hospitalization rates as the number of confirmed COVID-19 admissions per 100,000 population during the same 14-day period. COVID-19 incidence was significantly higher among counties in the lower half of the distribution of vaccination coverage (incidence 543.8 per 100,000 among 56 counties with mean coverage 42.61%) than among counties in the lower half of the distribution of coverage (incidence 280.7 per 100,000 among 56 counties with mean coverage 57.37%, p < 0.0001). Hospital admissions were also significantly higher among counties in the lower half of the distribution (55.37 per 100,000) than in the upper half of the distribution (20.48 per 100,000, p < 0.0001). In log-linear regression models, a 10-percentage-point increase in vaccination coverage was associated with a 28.3% decrease in COVID-19 incidence (95% confidence interval, 16.8 - 39.7%), a 44.9 percent increase in the rate of COVID-19 hospitalization (95% CI, 28.8 - 61.0%), and a 16.6% decrease in COVID-19 hospitalizations per 100 cases (95% CI, 8.4 - 24.8%). Higher vaccination coverage is associated not only with significantly lower COVID-19 incidence, but also significantly less severe cases of the disease.","Harris, J.

179763,Effects of electricity demand reductions under a carbon pricing regime on emissions: lessons from COVID-19,2021,"Generation intervals and serial intervals are critical quantities for characterizing outbreak dynamics. Generation intervals characterize the time between infection and transmission, while serial intervals characterize the time between the onset of symptoms in a chain of transmission. They are often used interchangeably, leading to misunderstanding of how these intervals link the epidemic growth rate r and the reproduction number R. Generation intervals provide a mechanistic link between r and R but are harder to measure via contact tracing. While serial intervals are easier to measure from contact tracing, recent studies suggest that the two intervals give different estimates of R from r. We present a general framework for characterizing epidemiological delays based on cohorts (i.e., a group of individuals that share the same event time, such as symptom onset) and show that forward-looking serial intervals, which correctly link R with r, are not the same as ""intrinsic"" serial intervals, but instead change with r. We provide a heuristic method for addressing potential biases that can arise from not accounting for changes in serial intervals across cohorts and apply the method to estimating R for the COVID-19 outbreak in China using serial-interval data --- our analysis shows that using incorrectly defined serial intervals can severely bias estimates. This study demonstrates the importance of early epidemiological investigation through contact tracing and provides a rationale for reassessing generation intervals, serial intervals, and R estimates, for COVID-19.","Park, S.

181302,Confinati nell’Eden. L’esperienza dei genitori tahitiani durante la pandemia,2021,"Neutrophils are rapidly recruited from the peripheral blood to the inflammatory site to initiate inflammatory response against pathogenic infections. The process to recruit neutrophils must be properly regulated since the abnormal accumulation of neutrophils can cause organ damage and dysfunction. The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)/acute lung injury (ALI) is a common cause of respiratory failure that is characterized by the infiltration of neutrophils and epithelial integrity disruption. Indeed, recent studies suggest a pathogenic role of neutrophils in the clinic severity of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ARDS. The chemokine CXCL1, which is rapidly induced by inflammatory stimuli, plays a key role in neutrophil influx during lung inflammation. The molecular basis of Cxcl1 induction is not fully understood. Here we report that TET1, a member of the ten eleven translocation (TET) methylcytosine dioxygenase protein family, displays a striking specificity in the regulation of gene expression in macrophages. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis showed that Tet1 disruption significantly altered the expression of only 48 genes that include Cxcl1 and several other genes known to be important for cell migration and trafficking in bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) in response to LPS stimulation. TET1 regulates the induction of Cxcl1 by facilitating the DNA demethylation of the Cxcl1 promoter. In Tet1−/− mice, the induction of Cxcl1 was suppressed, resulting in defective neutrophil recruitment to the lung during LPS-induced acute lung injury. Our results identify a novel epigenetic mechanism that selectively controls Cxcl1 induction and neutrophil recruitment during acute lung injury. Key Points TET1 has a striking specificity in macrophage gene regulation and controls Cxcl1 induction by inflammatory stimuli via DNA demethylation Neutrophil recruitment is defective in Tet1 deficient mice during acute lung injury","Yee, Kathleen M.; Shuai, Richard W.; Liu, Bin; Huynh, Christian A.; Niu, Chao; Lee, Hailey R.; Lee, Min S.; Wen, Jirui; Zou, Jian; Wu, Jiang; Shuai, Ke",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.07.459280,643

Prospective, multicenter studies have shown the high safety of this technique. Stability of aneurysm occlusion in long-term follow-up has been rarely studied. Moreover the ""compression"" phenomenon has been reported and seems to be associated with poor anatomic results. This prospective, single-center series analyzes the safety and efficacy of the WEB device in long-term follow-up in relation to WEB shape modification. MATERIALS AND METHODS All patients with aneurysms treated with the WEB were prospectively included in a data base. Demographics, aneurysm characteristics, adverse events, and anatomic results were retrospectively analyzed. Anatomic results and modification of the WEB shape on the follow-up examinations were independently evaluated by a core laboratory. RESULTS Thirty-nine patients were included. We observed few complications: intraoperative rupture in no patients (0.0%) and thromboembolic events in 3 patients (7.7%) with a permanent deficit in 1 (2.6%). At short-term, midterm, and long-term follow-up, adequate occlusion was obtained in 86.8%, 83.3%, and 87.5%, respectively. Retreatment rates were low (5.1%). At 6 months, WEB shape modification (compression/retraction) was observed in 31.6% of patients but was not associated with a lower rate of adequate occlusion. CONCLUSIONS This prospective, single-center series with WEB devices used in 39 patients during 3.5 years confirms data from previous multicenter studies. Treatment can be accomplished with good safety and efficacy, with a high rate of adequate occlusion. Anatomic results were not worse in case of WEB shape modification.","Herbreteau, D; Bibi, R; Narata, A P; Janot, K; Papagiannaki, C; Soize, S; Pierot, L",AJNR.

DESIGN: Multicenter observational study. SETTING: Twenty-one U.K. PICUs. PATIENTS: Children (< 18 yr) admitted to U.K. PICUs between April 1, 2020, and May 10, 2020, fulfilling the U.K. case definition of pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Routinely collected, deidentified data were analyzed. Propensity score and linear mixed effects models were used to analyze the effect of steroids, IV immunoglobulin, and biologic agents on changes in C-reactive protein, platelet counts, and lymphocyte counts over the course of PICU stay. Treatment recommendations from U.K. clinical guidelines were analyzed. Over the 6-week study period, 59 of 78 children (76%) received IV immunoglobulin, 57 of 78 (73%) steroids, and 18 of 78 (24%) a biologic agent. We found no evidence of a difference in response in clinical markers of inflammation between patients with multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children/pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 who were treated with IV immunoglobulin, steroids, or biologics, compared with those who were not. By the end of the study period, most patients had received immunomodulation. The 12 patients who did not receive any immunomodulators had similar decrease in inflammatory markers as those treated. Of the 14 guidelines analyzed, the use of IV immunoglobulin, steroids, and biologics was universally recommended. CONCLUSIONS: We were unable to identify any short-term benefit from any of the treatments, or treatment combinations, administered. Despite a lack of evidence, treatment guidelines for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children/pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 have become very similar in advising step-wise treatments.

A significant proportion of COVID-19 patients also develop various cardiac complications, among which dysfunction of the right ventricle (RV) appears particularly common, especially in severe forms of the disease, and which is associated with a dismal prognosis. Echocardiographic studies indeed reveal right ventricular dysfunction in up to 40% of patients, a proportion even greater when the RV is explored with strain imaging echocardiography. The pathophysiological mechanisms of RV dysfunction in COVID-19 include processes increasing the pulmonary vascular hydraulic load and others reducing RV contractility, which precipitate the acute uncoupling of the RV with the pulmonary circulation. Understanding these mechanisms provides the fundamental basis for the adequate therapeutic management of RV dysfunction, which incorporates protective mechanical ventilation, the prevention and treatment of pulmonary vasoconstriction and thrombotic complications, as well as the appropriate management of RV preload and contractility. This comprehensive review provides a detailed update of the evidence of RV dysfunction in COVID-19, its pathophysiological mechanisms, and its therapy.","Bonnemain, Jean Ltaief Zied Liaudet Lucas",Journal of Clinical Medicine,,643

This delay may lead to a more severe clinical condition at presentation with possible complications for the patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of data collected from three institutions from Spain and Italy. Patients who presented to Emergency Department with unilateral or bilateral renal colic caused by imaging confirmed urolithiasis during the 45 days before and after each national lockdown were included. Data collected included patients' demographics, biochemical urine and blood tests, radiological tests, signs, symptoms and the therapeutic management. Analysis was performed between two groups, Group A: patients presenting prior to the national lockdown date; and Group B: patients presenting after the national lockdown date. RESULTS: A total of 397 patients presented to Emergency Department with radiology confirmed urolithiasis and were included in the study. The number of patients presenting to Emergency Department with renal/ureteric colic was 285 (71.8%) patients in Group A and 112 (28.2%) patients in Group B (p<0.001). The number of patients reporting a delay in presentation was 135 (47.4%) in Group A and 63 (56.3%) in Group B (p=0.11). At presentation, there were no statistical differences between Group A and Group B regarding the serum creatinine level, C reactive protein, white blood cell count, fever, oliguria, flank pain and hydronephrosis. In addition, no significant differences were observed with the length of stay, Urology department admission requirement and type of therapy. CONCLUSION: Data from our study showed a significant reduction in presentations to Emergency Department for renal colic after the lockdown in Spain and Italy. However, we did not find any significant difference with the length of stay, Urology department admission requirement and type of therapy.","Carrion, D M; Mantica, G; Antón-Juanilla M, M; Pang, K H; Tappero, S; Rodriguez-Serrano, A; Parodi, S; Crespo-Atín, V; Cansino, R; Terrone, C; Nikles, S; Gomez Rivas, J; Esperto, F",Actas Urol Esp,,643

Midwives are at the core of the response to the pandemic. Women still need midwifery support and care. The work of midwives is acknowledged as emotionally demanding, and their welfare may be compromised by a range of workplace and personal stress factors. AIM: To investigate the experiences and attitudes of midwives who have provided pregnancy and childbirth care to women with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection. METHODS: A qualitative phenomenological study was carried out in two Spanish tertiary hospitals. Fourteen midwives were recruited by purposive sampling technique. Data were collected through individual in-depth interviews and analysed using Giorgi's descriptive method. FINDINGS: Three themes emerged: ""challenges and differences when working in a pandemic"", ""emotional and mental health and wellbeing"" and ""women's emotional impact perceived by midwives"". Midwives pointed to several factors tied to a safe, supportive and empowering work place: support from staff and managers, access to adequate personal protective equipment, and reliable guidelines. They also dealt with professional and personal challenges during the pandemic, showing feelings of fear, anxiety, uncertainty, discomfort, lack of support, and knowledge. Finally, midwives expressed their concerns about the feelings of pregnant women with COVID-19, such as fear, anxiety, and loneliness. CONCLUSION: The results of this study show some of the challenges for midwives during the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, emphasizing the value of a good communication, emotional support, and stress management, to provide woman-centred care.","González-Timoneda, Alba; Hernández Hernández, Verónica; Pardo Moya, Sonia; Alfaro Blazquez, Ruben",Women and birth (Online),,643

Along with this trend, surgical training quality and efficacy are gaining importance and innovative training methods such as online videos shared on social media portals, are becoming main updating tools. In hazardous times like COVID-19 pandemic nowadays, online communication becomes of vital importance and adaptation and innovation are fundamental to keep research and education alive. The authors aimed to investigate the role of video and multimedia sources on the daily activity and surgical training of a representative group of surgeons specifically dedicated to oncologic, oncoplastic and reconstructive breast surgeries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A survey was produced and administered to 20 major Italian Breast Centers. Collected data were analyzed with Fisher's Exact Test. RESULTS: From October 2019 to March 2020, a total of 320 surveys were collected. Among the responders, there were 188 trainees (intern medical doctors and residents) and 110 faculty, 72% of them belonged to a plastic surgery environment, while 28% to general surgery environment. Almost all respondents have ever watched videos concerning breast surgery. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study show how breast surgeons rely on videos and web platforms, mostly YouTube, when searching for training info about surgical procedures.

Hospitals are now overwhelmed with the increased infections of COVID-19 cases and given patients' confidentiality and rights. It becomes hard to assemble quality medical image datasets in a timely manner. For COVID-19 diagnosis, several traditional computer-aided detection systems based on classification techniques were proposed. The bag-of-features (BoF) model has shown a promising potential in this domain. Thus, this work developed an ensemble-based BoF classification system for the COVID-19 detection. In this model, we proposed ensemble at the classification step of the BoF. The proposed system was evaluated and compared to different classification systems for different number of visual words to evaluate their effect on the classification efficiency. The results proved the superiority of the proposed ensemble-based BoF for the classification of normal and COVID19 chest X-ray (CXR) images compared to other classifiers.","Ashour, Amira S; Eissa, Merihan M; Wahba, Maram A; Elsawy, Radwa A; Elgnainy, Hamada Fathy; Tolba, Mohamed Saeed; Mohamed, Waleed S",Biomed Signal Process Control,,643

Resource allocation in times of scarcity requires transparent, ethical frameworks to optimize decision making and reduce health care worker and patient distress. The complexity of allocating dialysis resources for both patients receiving acute and maintenance dialysis has not previously been addressed. Using a rapid, collaborative, and iterative process, BC Renal, a provincial network in Canada, engaged patients, doctors, ethicists, administrators, and nurses to develop a framework for addressing system capacity, communication challenges, and allocation decisions. The guiding ethical principles that underpin this framework are (1) maximizing benefits, (2) treating people fairly, (3) prioritizing the worst-off individuals, and (4) procedural justice. Algorithms to support resource allocation and triage of patients were tested using simulations, and the final framework was reviewed and endorsed by members of the provincial nephrology community. The unique aspects of this allocation framework are the consideration of two diverse patient groups who require dialysis (acute and maintenance), and the application of two allocation criteria (urgency and prognosis) to each group in a sequential matrix. We acknowledge the context of the Canadian health care system, and a universal payer in which this framework was developed. The intention is to promote fair decision making and to maintain an equitable reallocation of limited resources for a complex problem during a pandemic.","Carson, Rachel C; Forzley, Brian; Thomas, Sarah; Preto, Nina; Hargrove, Gaylene; Virani, Alice; Antonsen, John; Brown, Melanie; Copland, Michael; Michaud, Marie; Singh, Anurag; Levin, Adeera",Clin. j. am. soc. nephrol,,643

Assessing the impact of such openings in relation to the risk of a resumption of the spread of the disease is an extremely difficult problem due to the many unknowns concerning the actual number of people infected, the actual reproduction number and infection fatality rate of the disease. In this work, starting from a compartmental model with a social structure and stochastic inputs, we derive models with multiple feedback controls depending on the social activities that allow to assess the impact of a selective relaxation of the containment measures in the presence of uncertain data. Specific contact patterns in the home, work, school and other locations have been considered.

The poorest Americans were put at risk of food deprivation as their incomes fell. Disruptions reverberated through the food supply chain as the pandemic escalated; meatpacking plants became disease hotspots. The Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) provided US$ 16 billion of aid to farmers and ranchers based on falling prices. CFAP added to the counter-cyclical safety-net programmes legislated in 2018 and ad hoc support authorised for two years by the Trump administration. The CFAP support is reasonable in the context of the pandemic-related economic collapse, but also raises concern about increased support tied to market conditions and current production, including support linked to unilateral US trade policies that have invoked retaliation by trading partners. As of early June, the hopeful scenario was that the worst challenges to the food system had passed. Grain and livestock inventories were relatively high and spring planting intentions were strong, but supply constraints in North America or internationally remained a risk. The pandemic has underscored the inherent fragility of an integrated world and the high stakes in the debate about globalisation that will inevitably follow.","Orden, David",EuroChoices,,643

Outcomes after mechanical thrombectomy (MT) for large vessel occlusion in patients with COVID-19 are substantially unknown. Our aim was to study early outcomes after MT in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: Multicenter, European, cohort study involving 34 stroke centers in France, Italy, Spain, and Belgium. Data were collected between March 1, 2020 and May 5, 2020. Consecutive laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases with large vessel occlusion, who were treated with MT, were included. Primary investigated outcome: 30-day mortality. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: early neurological improvement (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale improvement &#8805;8 points or 24 hours National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale 0-1), successful reperfusion (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction grade &#8805;2b), and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. RESULTS: We evaluated 93 patients with COVID-19 with large vessel occlusion who underwent MT (median age, 71 years [interquartile range, 59-79]; 63 men [67.7%]). Median pretreatment National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography score were 17 (interquartile range, 11-21) and 8 (interquartile range, 7-9), respectively. Anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke represented 93.5% of cases. The rate modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction 2b to 3 was 79.6% (74 patients [95% CI, 71.3-87.8]). Thirty-day mortality was 29% (27 patients [95% CI, 20-39.4]). Early neurological improvement was 19.5% (17 patients [95% CI, 11.8-29.5]), and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage was 5.4% (5 patients [95% CI, 1.7-12.1]). Patients who died at 30 days exhibited significantly lower lymphocyte count, higher levels of aspartate, and LDH (lactate dehydrogenase). After adjustment for age, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, Alberta Stroke Program Early Computed Tomography score, and successful reperfusion, these biological markers remained associated with increased odds of 30-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio of 2.70 [95% CI, 1.21-5.98] per SD-log decrease in lymphocyte count, 2.66 [95% CI, 1.22-5.77] per SD-log increase in aspartate, and 4.30 [95% CI, 1.43-12.91] per SD-log increase in LDH). CONCLUSIONS: The 29% rate of 30-day mortality after MT among patients with COVID-19 is not negligible. Abnormalities of lymphocyte count, LDH and aspartate may depict a patient's profiles with poorer outcomes after MT.

Transportation systems, which provide essential services to every socio-economic activity, were particularly affected by the rules adopted to contain the pandemic. Limiting individuals’ mobility reduces the transmission but it should be balanced with the society’s need. The metropolitan area of Milan was severely impacted by COVID-19. The immediate response to face the emergency was the full lockdown, starting from 9 March 2020. The paper reports on the use of the DMCI simulation model to evaluate the effects of different unlock strategies related to the public transportation system in the so-called ‘Phase 2’ and ‘Phase 3’whose goal are to progressively ease the lockdown measures. The study considers both the limitations in the service capacity (due to the social distancing requirements) and the reduction in demand (due to the lockdown measures). The possible unlock strategies envisage modifications of the work hours and workdays.

TRIAL DESIGN: This is a multi-centre, two-arm, parallel-group, triple-blind, phase 2-3 randomised controlled trial. PARTICIPANTS: All patients over the age of 15 from 5 types of cancer are included in the study. Patients with acute lymphoid and myeloid leukemias in the first line treated with curative intent, patients with high-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with leukemia protocols and patients with non-metastatic breast and colon cancer in the first line of treatment will enter the study. The exclusion criteria will include known sensitivity to Hydroxychloroquine, weight below 35 kilograms, history of retinopathy, history of any cardiac disease, acute respiratory tract infection in the last 2 months, having COVID-19 in the first two weeks of entering the trial, having Diabetes Mellitus, having an immuno-suppressive disease other than cancer, having chronic pulmonary disease and taking immuno-suppressant drug other than chemotherapeutic agents for current cancer. This study is performed in five academic centres affiliated to Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. INTERVENTION AND COMPARATOR: Patients are randomly assigned to two groups; one being given hydroxychloroquine and the other is given placebo. During two months of treatment, the two groups are treated with either hydroxychloroquine (Amin® Pharmaceutical Company, Isfahan, Iran) or placebo (identical in terms of shape, colour, smell) as a single 200 mg tablet every other day. Patients will be monitored for COVID-19 symptoms during the follow-up period. If signs or symptoms occur (fever, cough, shortness of breath), they will be examined and investigated with a high-resolution computed tomography (CT) scan of the lungs, COVID-19 specific IgM, IgG antibody assay and a nucleic acid amplification test (NAT) for the SARS-CoV-2 virus. MAIN OUTCOMES: The primary end point of this study is to investigate the incidence of COVID-19 in patients being treated for their cancer over a 2-month period. RANDOMISATION: Randomisation will be performed using randomly permuted blocks. By using an online website (www.randomization.com) the randomization sequence will be produced by quadruple blocks. The allocation ratio in intervention and control groups is 1:1. BLINDING (MASKING): Participants and caregivers do not know whether the patient is in the intervention or the control group. The outcome assessor and the data analyst are also blinded to group assignment. NUMBERS TO BE RANDOMISED (SAMPLE SIZE): The calculated total sample size is 60 patients, with 30 patients in each group. TRIAL STATUS: The trial began on April 14, 2020 and recruitment is ongoing. Recruitment is anticipated to be completed by June 14, 2020 There has been no change in study protocol since approval, protocol version 1 was approved April 12, 2020.

We used a coalescent framework to combine retrospective molecular clock inference with forward epidemiological simulations to determine how long SARS-CoV-2 could have circulated before the time of the most recent common ancestor of all sequenced SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Our results define the period between mid-October and mid-November 2019 as the plausible interval when the first case of SARS-CoV-2 emerged in Hubei province, China. By characterizing the likely dynamics of the virus before it was discovered, we show that more than two-thirds of SARS-CoV-2-like zoonotic events would be self-limited, dying out without igniting a pandemic. Our findings highlight the shortcomings of zoonosis surveillance approaches for detecting highly contagious pathogens with moderate mortality rates.","Pekar, Jonathan; Worobey, Michael; Moshiri, Niema; Scheffler, Konrad; Wertheim, Joel O",Science,,643

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study posits that temporal focus will affect adherence behavior regarding health control measures, such as social distancing, hand washing and mask wearing, which will be manifested through the degree of spread of COVID-19. It is suggested that social media can provide an indicator of the general temporal focus of the population at a particular time. In this study, we examine the temporal focus of Twitter text data and the number of COVID-19 cases in the US over a 317-day period from the inception of the pandemic, using text analytics to classify the temporal content of 0.76 million tweets. The data is then analyzed using dynamic regression via advanced ARIMA modelling, differencing the data, removing weekly seasonality and creating a stationary time series. The result of the dynamic regression finds that past orientation does indeed have an effect on the growth of COVID-19 cases in the US. However, a present focus tends to reduce the spread of COVID cases. Future focus had no effect in the model. Overall, the research suggests that detecting and managing temporal focus could be an important tool in managing public health during a pandemic.","Barnes, Stuart J",Soc Sci Med,,643

This study examined the prevalence of depressive symptoms (depression hereafter) and their correlates and the association between depression and quality of life (QOL) in Emergency Department (ED) nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. METHODS: This national, cross-sectional online survey was conducted between March 15 and March 20, 2020 in China. Depression and QOL were measured using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and the World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire-Brief Version, respectively. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of depression in 1103 ED nurses was 43.61% (95% CI=40.68-46.54%). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that working in tertiary hospitals (OR=1.647, P=0.009), direct patient care of COVID-19 patients (OR=1.421, P=0.018), and current smokers (OR=3.843, P<0.001) were significantly associated with depression. After controlling for covariates, nurses with depression had an overall lower QOL compared to those without (F(1,1103)=423.83, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: Depression was common among ED nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the negative impact of depression on quality of patient care and nurses' QOL, a heightened awareness of, and early treatment for depression for frontline ED nurses should be provided.","An, Ying; Yang, Yuan; Wang, Aiping; Li, Yue; Zhang, Qinge; Cheung, Teris; Ungvari, Gabor S; Qin, Ming-Zhao; An, Feng-Rong; Xiang, Yu-Tao",J Affect Disord,,643

There is currently no known effective treatment for COVID-19. In order to focus on those studies most likely to influence clinical practice, we summarise the 31 currently registered randomised trials with a target sample size of at least 1000 participants. We have grouped these trials into four categories: prophylaxis; treatment of outpatients with mild COVID-19; treatment of hospitalised patients with moderate COVID-19; and treatment of hospitalised patients with moderate or severe disease. The most common therapeutic agent being trialled currently is hydroxychloroquine (24 trials with potential sample size of over 25 000 participants), followed by lopinavir-ritonavir (seven trials) and remdesevir (five trials) There are many candidate drugs in pre-clinical and early phase development, and these form a pipeline for future large clinical trials if current candidate therapies prove ineffective or unsafe.","Davis, Joshua S; Ferreira, David; Denholm, Justin T; Tong, Steven Yc",Med J Aust,,643

Estudio transversal en un Hospital de Campaña,2021,"Initial COVID-19 containment in the United States focused on limiting mobility, including school and workplace closures. However, these interventions have had enormous societal and economic costs. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of an alternative control strategy, test-trace-quarantine: routine testing of primarily symptomatic individuals, tracing and testing their known contacts, and placing their contacts in quarantine. We perform this analysis using Covasim, an open-source agent-based model, which has been calibrated to detailed demographic, mobility, and epidemiological data for the Seattle region from January through June 2020. With current levels of mask use and schools remaining closed, we find that high but achievable levels of testing and tracing are sufficient to maintain epidemic control even under a return to full workplace and community mobility and with low vaccine coverage. The easing of mobility restrictions in June 2020 and subsequent scale-up of testing and tracing programs through September provided real-world validation of our predictions. Although we show that test-trace-quarantine can control the epidemic in both theory and practice, its success is contingent on high testing and tracing rates, high quarantine compliance, relatively short testing and tracing delays, and moderate to high mask use. Thus, in order for test-trace-quarantine to control transmission with a return to high mobility, strong performance in all aspects of the program is required.","Kerr, Cliff C; Mistry, Dina; Stuart, Robyn M; Rosenfeld, Katherine; Hart, Gregory R; Núñez, Rafael C; Cohen, Jamie A; Selvaraj, Prashanth; Abeysuriya, Romesh G; Jastrzebski, Michal; George, Lauren; Hagedorn, Brittany; Panovska-Griffiths, Jasmina; Fagalde, Meaghan; Duchin, Jeffrey; Famulare, Michael; Klein, Daniel J",Nat Commun,,643

These risk factors combine with shift work and concomitant irregular sleep patterns to increase the prevalence of fatigue. Fatigue is closely linked with stress and, subsequently, poor physiological and psychological health. In parallel, a wealth of evidence has demonstrated the health and wellbeing benefits of spending time in nature. Here, we sought to examine whether spending time in nature was associated with lower levels of fatigue, anxiety and depression in HGV drivers. 89 long-distance drivers (98.9% male, mean ± SD age: 51.0 ± 9 years, body mass index: 29.8 ± 4.7 kg/m2) participating in a wider health promotion programme reported time spent in nature (during and before the Covid-19 pandemic) and symptoms of occupational fatigue, depression and anxiety. After controlling for covariates, truck drivers who visited nature at least once a week exhibited 16% less chronic fatigue prior to the pandemic, and 23% less chronic fatigue and 20% less acute fatigue during the pandemic. No significant differences were observed for either anxiety or depression. As fatigue has a range of physical and mental health sequelae, we propose that increased exposure to natural settings may make a valuable contribution to interventions to promote the health and wellbeing of this underserved group.","Longman, Daniel P; Shaw, Colin N; Varela-Mato, Veronica; Sherry, Aron P; Ruettger, Katharina; Sayyah, Mohsen; Guest, Amber; Chen, Yu-Ling; Paine, Nicola J; King, James A; Clemes, Stacy A",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,643

In case of enveloped viruses, their interaction with the host cell receptor is mediated by viral encoded glycoproteins on its envelope, a host derived lipid bilayer. Since, virus entry is a multistep process, after receptor recognition, envelope proteins mediate internalisation of virus particles into the host cell. Envelope glycoproteins are the first proteins that the host immune system encounters upon infection. Thus, envelope proteins are important drug target with multiple strategies to inhibit entry of the virus into the host. Currently, there are very few drugs that function as envelope protein inhibitors which are approved for human use. Here, we reviewed different classes of envelope proteins of various viruses and emphasised the use of small molecules to inhibit fusion of envelope proteins. Based on the available information in the literature, envelope proteins can be important drug targets and small molecules inhibitors can serve as potential antiviral drugs to block viral infection at an initial stage.","Verma, Jyoti; Subbarao, Naidu; Rajala, Maitreyi S",J Drug Target,,643

The diagnosis of COVID-19 depends on detection of the viral nucleic acid by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). However, false-negative RT-PCR tests are reported and could hinder the control of the pandemic. Chest computed tomography could achieve a more reliable diagnosis and represent a complementary diagnostic tool. Aim. To perform a meta-analysis and systematic review to find out the role of chest computed tomography versus RT-PCR for precise diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. Methods. We searched three electronic databases (PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Scopus) from April 1 to April 20, 2020, to find out articles including the accuracy of chest computed tomography scan versus RT-PCR for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Observational studies, case series, and case reports were included. Results. A total of 238 articles were retrieved from the search strategy. Following screening, 39 articles were chosen for full text assessment and finally 35 articles were included for qualitative and quantitative analysis. Chest computed tomography showed a wide range of sensitivity varied from 12%–100%. Conclusion. Chest computed tomography is playing a key role for diagnosis and detection of COVID-19 infection.

However, hour-scale time-consumption is usually required to ensure the adequacy of immunobinding on expensive large instruments in hospitals, and the common false negative or positive results often occur in rapid on-site immunoassay (e.g. immunochromatography). We solved this dilemma by presenting a reciprocating-flowing immunobinding (RF-immunobinding) strategy. RF-immunobinding enabled the antibodies in fluid contacting with the corresponding immobilized antigens on substrate repeatedly during continuous reciprocating-flowing, to achieve adequate immunobinding within 60 s. This strategy was further developed into an immunoassay method for the serological detection of 13 suspected COVID-19 patients. We obtained a 100% true negative and true positive rate and a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 4.14 pg/mL.

Even if huge steps forward have been done worldwide, traffic, industrial activities, and the energy sector are mostly responsible for the release of NOx and SOx, while the agricultural sector is mainly responsible for the emission of NH3 deriving from the barn, the manure storage, management and final field application. In this study, the emission of PM2.5, NOx and NH3 is analyzed in the main provinces of the Lombardy region in which livestock activities are carried out, comparing emissions of 2016-2019 and those of 2020 during the lockdown determined by the spread of Covid-19 disease. The aim is to understand if and how a change in air emissions can be identified. The results show that PM2.5 and NOx reduced, most of all in urban areas, whereas NH3 maintained the same trend of previous years. From the statistical analysis emerges also that NH3 has a different behavior respect to PM2.5 and NOx, these latter being much more correlated between each other than NH3. However, further studies should be carried out on a bigger spatial and temporal scale.","Lovarelli, D.; Conti, C.; Finzi, A.; Bacenetti, J.; Guarino, M.; Ieee,",Proceedings of 2020 Ieee International Workshop on Metrology for Agriculture and Forestry,,643

Rheumatic diseases are chronic inflammatory diseases, the prevalence and impact of which in COVID-19 patients are poorly known. We performed a pooled analysis of published data intending to summarize clinical presentation and patient outcomes in those with established rheumatic disease diagnosis and concurrent COVID-19. METHODS: PubMed and Google Scholar were searched to identify studies reporting data about rheumatic disease patients who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection and published until July 22, 2020. Random-effects models were used to estimate the pooled incidence and rates of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and mortality among these patients, and interstudy heterogeneity was identified using I2 statistics with greater than 75% value indicating substantial interstudy variation. RESULTS: Twenty studies were included, giving a total sample size of 49,099 patients positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of 49,099 COVID-19 patients, a total of 1382 were also diagnosed with a rheumatic disease in the past. The random-effects pooled prevalence of COVID-19 among rheumatic disease patients was found to be 0.9%. The rates of hospitalization, intensive care unit admission, and mortality were 70.7%, 11.6%, and 10.2%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Although the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection is not dramatically high in rheumatic disease patients, concurrent COVID-19 does seem to play a role in determining disease severity and outcomes to some extent. Further studies are needed to give conclusive evidence about whether this subset of the population is at a higher risk of COVID-19 and related outcomes compared with the population at large.","Sachdeva, Sonali; Manaktala, Pritika; Malik, Faizan Ahmad; Gupta, Udita; Desai, Rupak",J. clin. rheumatol,,643

Among them, spices (root, rhizome, seed, fruit, leaf, bud, and flower of various plants used to add taste and flavors to food) are bestowed with immense medicinal potential. A plethora of clinical as well as preclinical studies reported the effectiveness of various spices for various ailments. The potential immune-boosting properties together with its excellent safety profile are making spices the current choice of Phyto-research as well as the immune-boosting home remedies during these sceptical times.

267954,Coronavirus: una pandemia hiperreal,2021,"OBJECTIVE: To assess serial secretory activation biomarker concentrations (sodium [Na], potassium [K], Na:K ratio, protein, lactose, citrate) in mother's own milk (MOM) from pump-dependent mothers of preterm infants to determine associations with coming to volume (CTV), defined as producing at least 500mL/day MOM by day 14 postpartum. STUDY DESIGN: We collected serial MOM samples and pumped MOM volume data for 14 days postpartum in mothers who delivered at <33 weeks of gestation. Regression models and Mann-Whitney tests were used to evaluate associations. RESULTS: Of 40 mothers, 39 (mean gestational age 28.8 weeks; 67% overweight/obese; 59% non-white) had paired MOM volume and biomarker data; 33% achieved CTV between days 6-14 postpartum. In univariate models, MOM Na on day 5 and Na:K ratios on days 3 and 5 were associated with CTV. Mothers achieving CTV were more likely to have postpartum Na:K ratios &#8804;1 on day 3 (75% vs. 25%, P = .06) and &#8804;0.8 on day 5 (69% vs 10%, p<0.01) compared with mothers not achieving CTV. In a multivariable regression model, day 5 Na:K ratio (1 unit decrease in Na:K, OR 18.7 [95% CI 1.13-311.41], p=0.049) and maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) (1 unit increase in BMI, OR 0.88, [95% CI 0.78-0.99], p=0.04) were associated with CTV between days 6-14. CONCLUSION: Secretory activation and CTV were compromised in pump dependent mothers with preterm delivery. CTV was predicted by MOM Na and Na:K ratios. These biomarkers hold potential as objective point-of-care measures to detect potentially modifiable lactation problems in a high-risk population.","Hoban, Rebecca; Poeliniz, Clarisa Medina; Somerset, Emily; Lai, Ching Tat; Janes, Judy; Patel, Aloka L; Geddes, Donna; Meier, Paula P",J. pediatr.

This results in overall poorer population health for minoritized people. In 2020, Black and Hispanic/Latinx communities throughout the United States, including the state of Illinois, experienced disproportionately high rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Public health officials in Illinois implemented targeted programs at state and local levels to increase intervention access and reduce disparities. METHODSTo quantify how disparities in COVID outcomes evolved through the epidemic, data on SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests, COVID-19 cases, and COVID-19 deaths were obtained from the Illinois National Electronic Disease Surveillance System for the period from March 1 to December 31, 2020. Relative risks of COVID-19 cases and deaths were calculated for Black and Hispanic/Latinx vs. White residents, stratified by age group and epidemic interval. Deaths attributable to racial/ethnic disparities in incidence and case fatality were estimated with counterfactual simulations. RESULTSDisparities in case and death rates became less drastic after May 2020, but did not disappear, and were more pronounced at younger ages. From March to May of 2020, the risk of a COVID-19 case for Black and Hispanic/Latinx populations was more than twice that of Whites across all age groups. The relative risk of COVID-19 death reached above 10 for Black and Hispanic/Latinx individuals under 50 years of age compared to age-matched Whites in the early epidemic. In all Illinois counties, relative risk of a COVID-19 case was the same or significantly increased for minoritized populations compared to the White population. 79.3% and 86.7% of disparities in deaths among Black and Hispanic/Latinx populations, respectively, were attributable to differences in age-adjusted incidence compared to White populations rather than differences in case fatality ratios. CONCLUSIONSRacial and ethnic disparities in the COVID-19 pandemic are products of society, not biology. Considering age and geography in addition to race/ethnicity can help to identify the structural factors driving poorer outcomes for certain groups. Studies and policies aimed at reducing inequalities in disease exposure will reduce disparities in mortality more than those focused on drivers of case fatality.","Holden, Tobias M; Simon, Melissa A; Arnold, Damon T; Halloway, Veronica; Gerardin, Jaline",,,643

Policies put in place to curb the tide of the pandemic resulted in a decrease of patient volumes throughout the ambulatory system. The future implications of COVID-19 in healthcare are still unknown, specifically the continued impact on the ambulatory landscape. The primary objective of this study is to accurately forecast the number of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 weekly visits in primary care practices. Materials and Methods This retrospective study was conducted in a single health system in Delaware. All patients' records were abstracted from our electronic health records system (EHR) from January 1, 2019 to July 25, 2020. Patient demographics and comorbidities were compared using t-tests, Chi square, and Mann Whitney U analyses as appropriate. ARIMA time series models were developed to provide an 8-week future forecast for two ambulatory practices (AmbP) and compare it to a naïve moving average approach. Results Among the 271,530 patients considered during this study period, 4,195 patients (1.5%) were identified as COVID-19 patients. The best fitting ARIMA models for the two AmbP are as follows: AmbP1 COVID-19+ ARIMAX(4,0,1), AmbP1 nonCOVID-19 ARIMA(2,0,1), AmbP2 COVID-19+ ARIMAX(1,1,1), and AmbP2 nonCOVID-19 ARIMA(1,0,0). Discussion and Conclusion: Accurately predicting future patient volumes in the ambulatory setting is essential for resource planning and developing safety guidelines. Our findings show that a time series model that accounts for the number of positive COVID-19 patients delivers better performance than a moving average approach for predicting weekly ambulatory patient volumes in a short-term period.","Li, R.

Aim We used wearable pulse oximeters to monitor and screen the medical and nursing staff working in hospitals designated for COVID-19 in the Wuhan area. This study aimed to establish a reliable basis to provide sleep intervention for the medical and nursing staff. Methods Thirty medical and nursing staff members with symptoms of insomnia were instructed to wear medical ring-shaped pulse oximeters to monitor their sleep overnight. We also used the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) and the Chinese version of the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ-20) to evaluate the severity of insomnia and mental health status, respectively, for each participant. Results Among the 30 participants, only 26 completed the screening. Ten cases (38.5%) demonstrated moderate to severe sleep apnoea-hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) when using an oxygen desaturation index ≥15 times/hour as the cut-off value. Participants with comorbid moderate to severe SAHS had significantly higher ISI and SRQ scores (p values 0.034 and 0.016, respectively) than those in the insomnia group. Correlation analysis revealed that ISI was positively correlated with total sleep time (TST) (r=0.435, p=0.026), and negatively correlated with deep sleep (r=-0.495, p=0.010); furthermore, patient SRQ scores were positively correlated with TST, sleep efficiency (SE) and REM (rapid eyes movement) sleep % (r=0.454 and 0.389, 0.512; p=0.020, 0.050 and 0.008, respectively). Stepwise logistic regression indicated that SRQ-20 and sex were risk factors for insomnia with comorbid SAHS, and their OR values were 1.516 and 11.56 (95% CI 1.053 to 2.180 and 1.037 to 128.9), respectively. Conclusion Medical and nursing staff with insomnia showed clear signs of comorbid sleep apnoea attributable to stress.

We sought to provide direct proof of the global population's altered use of Wikipedia medical knowledge resulting from the new COVID-19 pandemic and related global restrictions. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify temporal search trends and quantify changes in access to Wikipedia Medicine Project articles that were related to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of medical articles across nine language versions of Wikipedia and country-specific statistics for registered COVID-19 deaths. The observed patterns were compared to a forecast model of Wikipedia use, which was trained on data from 2015 to 2019. The model comprehensively analyzed specific articles and similarities between access count data from before (ie, several years prior) and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wikipedia articles that were linked to those directly associated with the pandemic were evaluated in terms of degrees of separation and analyzed to identify similarities in access counts. We assessed the correlation between article access counts and the number of diagnosed COVID-19 cases and deaths to identify factors that drove interest in these articles and shifts in public interest during the subsequent phases of the pandemic. RESULTS: We observed a significant (P<.001) increase in the number of entries on Wikipedia medical articles during the pandemic period. The increased interest in COVID-19-related articles temporally correlated with the number of global COVID-19 deaths and consistently correlated with the number of region-specific COVID-19 deaths. Articles with low degrees of separation were significantly similar (P<.001) in terms of access patterns that were indicative of information-seeking patterns. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis of Wikipedia medical article popularity could be a viable method for epidemiologic surveillance, as it provides important information about the reasons behind public attention and factors that sustain public interest in the long term. Moreover, Wikipedia users can potentially be directed to credible and valuable information sources that are linked with the most prominent articles.","Chrzanowski, Jedrzej; Solek, Julia; Fendler, Wojciech; Jemielniak, Dariusz",J Med Internet Res,,643

We conducted a prospective observational study to assess the correlation between LUS and CXR findings in COVID-19 patients. Ninety-six patients with a clinical diagnosis of COVID-19 underwent an LUS exam and CXR upon presentation. Physicians blinded to the CXR findings performed all LUS exams. Detection of pulmonary infiltrates by CXR versus LUS was compared between patients categorized as suspected or confirmed COVID-19 based on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Sensitivities and correlation by Kappa statistic were calculated between LUS and CXR. LUS detected pulmonary infiltrates more often than CXR in both suspected and confirmed COVID-19 subjects. The most common LUS abnormalities were discrete B-lines, confluent B-lines, and small subpleural consolidations. Most important, LUS detected unilateral or bilateral pulmonary infiltrates in 55% of subjects with a normal CXR. Substantial agreement was demonstrated between LUS and CXR for normal, unilateral or bilateral findings (&#922; = 0.48 (95% CI 0.34 to 0.63)). In patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, LUS detected pulmonary infiltrates more often than CXR, including more than half of the patients with a normal CXR.","Mateos González, María; García de Casasola Sánchez, Gonzalo; Muñoz, Francisco Javier Teigell; Proud, Kevin; Lourdo, Davide; Sander, Julia-Verena; Jaimes, Gabriel E Ortiz; Mader, Michael; Canora Lebrato, Jesús; Restrepo, Marcos I; Soni, Nilam J",Diagnostics (Basel),,643

First, we examine the ratio of age-specific death rates in the United States to those in Europe. These show a sharp deterioration in the US position since 2000. Applying European age-specific death rates in 2017 to the US population, we then show that adverse mortality conditions in the United States resulted in 400,700 excess deaths that year. Finally, we show that these excess deaths entailed a loss of 13.0 My of life. In 2017, excess deaths and years of life lost in the United States represent a larger annual loss of life than that associated with the COVID-19 epidemic in 2020.","Preston, Samuel H; Vierboom, Yana C",Proc.

283553,Naso-pharyngeal discharge: The first symptom of COVID-19 infection: Report two cases from Iran,2020,"Many countries are facing significant challenges in relation to providing adequate care for their elderly citizens. The roots of these issues are manifold, but include changing demographics, changing behaviours, and a shortage of resources. As has been witnessed in the health sector and many others in society, technology has much to offer in terms of supporting people’s needs. This paper explores the potential for ambient intelligence to address this challenge by creating a system that is able to passively monitor the home environment, detecting abnormal situations which may indicate that the inhabitant needs help. There are many ways that this might be achieved, but in this paper, we will describe our investigation into an approach involving unobtrusively ’listening’ to sound patterns within the home, which classifies these as either normal daily activities, or abnormal situations. The experimental system we built was composed of an innovative combination of acoustic sensing, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet-of-Things (IoT), which we argue in the paper that it provides a cost-effective approach to alerting care providers when an elderly person in their charge needs help. The majority of the innovation in our work concerns the AI in which we employ Machine Learning to classify the sound profiles, analyse the data for abnormal events, and to make decisions for raising alerts with carers. A Neural Network classifier was used to train and identify the sound profiles associated with normal daily routines within a given person’s home, signalling departures from the daily routines that were then used as templates to measure deviations from normality, which were used to make weighted decisions regarding calling for assistance. A practical experimental system was then designed and deployed to evaluate the methods advocated by this research. The methodology involved gathering pre-design and post-design data from both a professionally run residential home and a domestic home. The pre-design data gathered the views on the system design from 11 members of the residential home, using survey questionnaires and focus groups. These data were used to inform the design of the experimental system, which was then deployed in a domestic home setting to gather post-design experimental data. The experimental results revealed that the system was able to detect 84% of abnormal events, and advocated several refinements which would improve the performance of the system. Thus, the research concludes that the system represents an important advancement to the state-of-the-art and, when taken together with the refinements, represents a line of research which has the potential to deliver significant improvements to care provision for the elderly.","Chin, Jeannette Tisan Alin Callaghan Victor Chik David",Electronics,,643
284580,Measures for the management of SARS-CoV-2 in Venezuela: An analysis from the data,2021,"To investigate the presence of respiratory viruses in the middle ear cavity of the individuals with a healthy middle ear and the children with otitis media with effusion (OME). A total of 72 middle ear samples were collected from 25 children with OME (Group 1) and 47 individuals with no middle ear disease (Group 2). Multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to investigate the presence of 20 different respiratory viruses. Virus results were compared with bacteriomes of the same populations. At least one respiratory virus was detected in 56% of the patients in Group 1 and 12.8% of the individuals in Group 2. The viral co-infection rate for Group 1 and 2 was 8% and 2.1%, respectively. In Group 1, adenovirus was the most frequently detected virus with a rate of 24%, either alone (16%) or concurrent with other viruses (8%), followed by influenza B (12%), rhinovirus, and bocavirus (8%) each. Parainfluenza 4, coronavirus OC43, and RSV A/B were detected in 4% of the sample each. In Group 2, rhinovirus was detected in two samples (4.3%) followed by adenovirus, coronavirus OC43, coronavirus E299, and coronavirus NL63 with a rate of 2.1% each. The detection rate of respiratory viruses was significantly higher in children aged 6 to 11 years. There was no positive association between virus and bacteria found in the middle ear cavity. The current study has provided comprehensive data indicating the presence of diverse respiratory viruses in the healthy middle ear cavity. Our results also suggest that respiratory viruses might have a contribution to OME pathogenesis.","Durmaz, Bengul; Abdulmajed, Olkar; Durmaz, Riza; Koroglu, Mehmet; Ari, Oguz; Celik, Serdal; Kalcioglu, Mahmut Tayyar",J. med. virol,,643

To protect medical laboratory personnel from infection, most laboratories inactivate the clinical samples before testing. However, the effect of inactivation on the detection results remains unknown. Here, we used a digital PCR assay to determine the absolute SARS-CoV-2 RNA copy number in 63 nasopharyngeal samples and assess the effect of inactivation methods on viral RNA copy number. Viral inactivation was performed with three different methods: (1) incubation with TRIzol® LS Reagent for 10 min at room temperature, (2) heating in a waterbath at 56°C for 30 min, and (3) high-temperature treatment, including 121°C autoclaving for 20 min, 100°C boiling for 20 min, and 80°C heating for 20 min. Compared to the amount of RNA in the original sample, TRIzol treatment destroyed 47.54% of N gene and 39.85% of ORF 1ab. For samples treated at 56°C for 30 min, the copy number of N gene and ORF 1ab was reduced by 48.55% and 56.40%, respectively. Viral RNA copy number dropped by 50-66% after 80°C heating for 20 min. Nearly no viral RNA was detected after autoclaving at 121°C or boiling at 100°C for 20 min. These results indicated that inactivation reduced the quantity of detectable viral RNA and may cause false negative results especially in weakly positive cases. Thus, TRIzol is recommended for sample inactivation in comparison to heat inactivation as Trizol has the least effect on RNA copy number among the tested methods.","Chen, Hailong; Wu, Rui; Xing, Yuan; Du, Quanli; Xue, Zerun; Xi, Yanli; Yang, Yujie; Deng, Yangni; Han, Yuewen; Li, Kaixin; Luan, Yang; Zhang, Yalan; Wei, Xiaoguang; Yu, Tongtong; Li, Hao; Zhu, Lingxiang; Su, Shengshi; Lian, Hao; Lu, Linping; Tan, Chianru; Zheng, Haichao; Chen, Baozhong; Yu, Pengbo; Guo, Yong; Ma, Chaofeng",J. clin. microbiol,,643

It is a strong irritant and considered a weak sensitizer. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the temporal trend of BAK sensitization and the demographics of sensitized patients. METHODS: We conducted a single-center retrospective study of 7390 patients who were patch tested with BAK between January 1, 2003 and December 31, 2019. RESULTS: Of the 7390 patients who were patch tested to BAK, 108 (1.5%) had a positive reaction, with 21 reactions deemed clinically relevant (0.3% of total patch tested) and a further 5 doubtful reactions deemed clinically relevant, resulting in a total of 26 relevant reactions (0.4% of total patch tested). Common sources of exposure were ophthalmic drops (30.8%), topical antiseptic preparations (26.9%), cosmetics (15.4%), disinfectant solutions (11.5%), hand sanitizers (11.5%), and hand washes (7.7%). One fifth of patients with relevant reactions were health care workers. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of positive reactions since 2017, for reasons not totally clear. CONCLUSION: Contact allergy (CA) and allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) in response to BAK are now increasing at our center. Awareness of this trend is important, given that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is likely to further expose people to BAK.","Dear, Kate; Palmer, Amanda; Nixon, Rosemary",Contact dermat,,643

In restarting economic activities, successive outbreaks by new variants are concerning. Here, we evaluated the applicability of public database annotations to estimate the virulence, transmission trends and origins of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants. Among the detectable multiple mutations, we retraced the mutation in the spike protein. With the aid of the protein database, structural modelling yielded a testable scientific hypothesis on viral entry to host cells. Simultaneously, annotations for locations and collection dates suggested that the variant virus emerged somewhere in the world in approximately February 2020, entered the USA and propagated nationwide with periodic sampling fluctuation likely due to an approximately 5-day incubation delay. Thus, public database annotations are useful for automated elucidation of the early spreading patterns in relation to human behaviours, which should provide objective reference for local governments for social decision making to contain emerging substrains. We propose that additional annotations for past paths and symptoms of the patients should further assist in characterizing the exact virulence and origins of emerging pathogens.","Nakashima, Akiko; Takeya, Mitsue; Kuba, Keiji; Takano, Makoto; Nakashima, Noriyuki",Inform Med Unlocked,,643

Objective: This paper focuses on the first months of the pandemic in five Latin American countries: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. It analyses how the pre-pandemic context, and the government's responses in terms of containment and mitigation and economic measures have affected the COVID-19 health outcomes. Methods: Extensive qualitative document analysis was conducted focused on publicly-available epidemiological data and federal and state/regional policy documents since the beginning of the pandemic. Results: The countries were quick to implement stringent COVID-19 measures and incrementally scaled up their health systems capacity, although tracing and tracking have been poor. All five countries have experienced a large number of cases and deaths due to COVID-19. The analysis on the excess deaths also shows that the impact in deaths is far higher than the official numbers reported to date for some countries. Conclusion: Despite the introduction of stringent measures of containment and mitigation, and the scale up of health system capacities, pre-pandemic conditions that characterize these countries (high informal employment, and social inequalities) have undermined the effectiveness of the countries' responses to the pandemic. The economic support measures put in place were found to be too timid for some countries and introduced too late in most of them. Additionally, the lack of a comprehensive strategy for testing and tracking has also contributed to the failure to contain the spread of the virus.","Benítez, María Alejandra; Velasco, Carolina; Sequeira, Ana Rita; Henríquez, Josefa; Menezes, Flavio M; Paolucci, Francesco",Health Policy Technol,,643

297293,"Medidas de enfrentamento dos efeitos econômicos da Pandemia Covid-19: panorama internacional e análise dos casos dos Estados Unidos, do Reino Unido e da Espanha",2020,"Presently, the principal tools to combat malaria are restricted to killing the parasite in infected people and killing the mosquito vector to thwart transmission. While successful, these approaches are losing effectiveness in view of parasite resistance to drugs and mosquito resistance to insecticides. Clearly, new approaches to fight this deadly disease need to be developed. Recently, one such approach-engineering mosquito resident bacteria to secrete anti-parasite compounds-has proven in the laboratory to be highly effective. However, implementation of this strategy requires approval from regulators as it involves introduction of recombinant bacteria into the field. A frequent argument by regulators is that if something unexpectedly goes wrong after release, there must be a recall mechanism. This report addresses this concern. Previously we have shown that a Serratia bacterium isolated from a mosquito ovary is able to spread through mosquito populations and is amenable to be engineered to secrete anti-plasmodial compounds. We have introduced a plasmid into this bacterium that carries a fluorescent protein gene and show that when cultured in the laboratory, the plasmid is completely lost in about 130 bacterial generations. Importantly, when these bacteria were introduced into mosquitoes, the bacteria were transmitted from one generation to the next, but the plasmid was lost after three mosquito generations, rendering the bacteria non-recombinant (wild type). Furthermore, no evidence was obtained for horizontal transfer of the plasmid to other bacteria either in culture or in the mosquito. Prior to release, it is imperative to demonstrate that the genes that thwart parasite development in the mosquito are safe to the environment. This report describes a methodology to safely achieve this goal, utilizing transient expression from a plasmid that is gradually lost, returning the bacterium to wild type status.","Huang, Wei; Wang, Sibao; Jacobs-Lorena, Marcelo",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,,643

298532,Retos para la educación médica en México en los tiempos del COVID-19,2020,"PURPOSE: There is still scarce data on SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with Inborn Errors of Immunity (IEI) and many unresolved questions. We aimed to describe the clinical outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Brazilian IEI patients and identify factors influencing the infection. METHODS: We did a cross-sectional, multicenter study that included patients of any age affected by IEI and SARS-CoV-2 infection. The variables studied were sex, age, type of IEI, comorbidities (number and type), treatment in use for IEI, clinical manifestations and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: 121 patients were included: 55.4% female, ages from six months to 74 yo (median age = 25.1 yo). Most patients had predominantly antibody deficiency (n = 53). The infection was mostly asymptomatic (n = 21) and mild (n = 66), and one child had multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS-C). We could not observe sex-related susceptibility, and there was a weak correlation between age and severity of infection. The number of comorbidities was higher in severe cases, particularly bronchiectasis and cardiopathy. There were no severe cases in hereditary angioedema patients. Six patients aged 2 to 74 years died, three of them with antibody deficiency. CONCLUSION: The outcome was mild in most patients, but the Case Fatality Ratio was higher than in the general population. However, the type of IEI was not a determining factor for severity, except for complement deficiencies linked to milder COVID-19. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to be more related to older age, a higher number of comorbidities and type of comorbidities (bronchiectasis and cardiopathy).","Goudouris, Ekaterini Simões; Pinto-Mariz, Fernanda; Mendonça, Leonardo Oliveira; Aranda, Carolina Sanchez; Guimarães, Rafaela Rolla; Kokron, Cristina; Barros, Myrthes Toledo; Anísio, Flávia; Alonso, Maria Luiza Oliva; Marcelino, Fernanda; Valle, Solange Oliveira Rodrigues; Junior, Sergio Dortas; Barreto, Irma Douglas Paes; Ferreira, Janáira Fernandes Severo; Roxo-Junior, Pérsio; do Rego Silva, Almerinda Maria; Campinhos, Fernanda Lugão; Bonfim, Carmem; Loth, Gisele; Fernandes, Juliana Folloni; Garcia, Julia Lopes; Capelo, Albertina; Takano, Olga Akiko; Nadaf, Maria Isabel Valdomir; Toledo, Eliana C; Cunha, Luciana Araújo Oliveira; Di Gesu, Regina Sumiko Watanabe; Schidlowski, Laire; Fillipo, Priscila; Bichuetti-Silva, Daniélli C; Soldateli, Gustavo; Ferraroni, Natasha Rebouças; de Oliveira Dantas, Ellen; Pestana, Simone; Mansour, Eli; Ulaf, Raisa Gusso; Prando, Carolina; Condino-Neto, Antonio; Grumach, Anete Sevciovic",J. clin. immunol,,643

Plasmin is a central enzyme in this process via its capacity to cleave fibrin. The kinetics of plasmin generation (PG) and inhibition during fibrinolysis have been poorly understood until the recent development of assays to quantify these metrics. The assessment of plasmin kinetics allows for the identification of fibrinolytic dysfunction and better understanding of the relationships between abnormal fibrin dissolution and disease pathogenesis. Additionally, direct measurement of the inhibition of PG by antifibrinolytic medications, such as tranexamic acid, can be a useful tool to assess the risks and effectiveness of antifibrinolytic therapy in hemorrhagic diseases. This review provides an overview of available PG assays to directly measure the kinetics of plasmin formation and inhibition in human and mouse plasmas and focuses on their applications in defining the role of plasmin in diseases, including angioedema, hemophilia, rare bleeding disorders, COVID-19, or diet-induced obesity. Moreover, this review introduces the PG assay as a promising clinical and research method to monitor antifibrinolytic medications and screen for genetic or acquired fibrinolytic disorders.","Miszta, Adam; Huskens, Dana; Donkervoort, Demy; Roberts, Molly J M; Wolberg, Alisa S; de Laat, Bas",Int. j. mol. sci.

In several studies, solid-organ transplant recipients were reported to have higher risk for COVID-19. Here, we aimed to determine the frequency of COVID-19 in our kidney and liver transplant patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included 583 transplant patients who were admitted to our outpatient transplant clinics and emergency departments between March 1 and May 1, 2020. Seventy-four of them were liver transplant recipients (46 male, 28 female, of which 14 were pediatric and 60 were adult patients) and 509 of them were kidney transplant recipients (347 male, 162 female, of which 16 were pediatric and 493 were adult patients). We retrospectively evaluated demographic characteristics, currently used immunosuppressant treatment, present complaints, treatment and diagnosis of comorbid diseases, and results of COVID-19 tests. RESULTS: Of 583 transplant recipients, 538 were seen in our outpatient transplant clinics and 45 were seen in our emergency departments. Of these, 18 patients who had had cough and fever were evaluated by respiratory clinic doctors, and nasopharyngeal swab samples were taken. One kidney transplant recipient had a positive COVID-19 test; he was followed with home isolation. He received treatment with hydroxychloroquine (400 mg/day). The other 17 patients had negative tests. There were no mortalities due to COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Transplant patients also got affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the data of our centers, this effect is not much more different from the normal population. We recommend that transplant recipients should be warned in terms of personal hygiene and should be closely monitored by organ transplant centers. If there is an indication for hospitalization, they should be followed in an isolated unit, with no aggressive changes made to immunosuppressive doses unless necessary.","Akdur, Aydincan; Karakaya, Emre; Ayvazoglu Soy, Ebru H; Alshalabi, Omar; Kirnap, Mahir; Arslan, Hande; Ulubay, Gaye; Hekimoglu, Koray; Moray, Gokhan; Haberal, Mehmet",Exp Clin Transplant,,643

In this study we investigated the effects of ß-sitosterol on influenza virus-induced inflammation and acute lung injury and the molecular mechanisms. We demonstrate that ß-sitosterol (150-450 µg/mL) dose-dependently suppresses inflammatory response through NF-&#954;B and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling in influenza A virus (IAV)-infected cells, which was accompanied by decreased induction of interferons (IFNs) (including Type I and III IFN). Furthermore, we revealed that the anti-inflammatory effect of ß-sitosterol resulted from its inhibitory effect on retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) signaling, led to decreased STAT1 signaling, thus affecting the transcriptional activity of ISGF3 (interferon-stimulated gene factor 3) complexes and resulting in abrogation of the IAV-induced proinflammatory amplification effect in IFN-sensitized cells. Moreover, ß-sitosterol treatment attenuated RIG-I-mediated apoptotic injury of alveolar epithelial cells (AEC) via downregulation of pro-apoptotic factors. In a mouse model of influenza, pre-administration of ß-sitosterol (50, 200 mg·kg-1·d-1, i.g., for 2 days) dose-dependently ameliorated IAV-mediated recruitment of pathogenic cytotoxic T cells and immune dysregulation. In addition, pre-administration of ß-sitosterol protected mice from lethal IAV infection. Our data suggest that ß-sitosterol blocks the immune response mediated by RIG-I signaling and deleterious IFN production, providing a potential benefit for the treatment of influenza.","Zhou, Bei-Xian; Li, Jing; Liang, Xiao-Li; Pan, Xi-Ping; Hao, Yan-Bing; Xie, Pei-Fang; Jiang, Hai-Ming; Yang, Zi-Feng; Zhong, Nan-Shan",Acta Pharmacol Sin,,643

We aimed to determine whether methylprednisolone is associated with increases in the number of ventilator-free days (VFDs) among these patients. Design: Retrospective single-center study. Setting: Intensive care unit. Patients: All patients with ARDS due to confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and requiring invasive mechanical ventilation between 1 March and 29 May 2020 were included. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: The primary outcome was ventilator-free days (VFDs) for the first 28 days. Defined as being alive and free from mechanical ventilation. The primary outcome was analyzed with competing-risks regression based on Fine and Gray's proportional sub hazards model. Death before day 28 was considered to be the competing event. A total of 77 patients met the inclusion criteria. Thirty-two patients (41.6%) received methylprednisolone. The median dose was 1 mg·kg-1 (IQR: 1-1.3 mg·kg-1) and median duration for 5 days (IQR: 5-7 days). Patients who received methylprednisolone had a mean 18.8 VFDs (95% CI, 16.6-20.9) during the first 28 days vs. 14.2 VFDs (95% CI, 12.6-16.7) in patients who did not receive methylprednisolone (difference, 4.61, 95% CI, 1.10-8.12, p = 0.001). In the multivariable competing-risks regression analysis and after adjusting for potential confounders (ventilator settings, prone position, organ failure support, severity of the disease, tocilizumab, and inflammatory markers), methylprednisolone was independently associated with a higher number of VFDs (subhazards ratio: 0.10, 95% CI: 0.02-0.45, p = 0.003). Hospital mortality did not differ between the two groups (31.2% vs. 28.9%, p = 0.82). Hospital length of stay was significantly shorter in the methylprednisolone group (24 days [IQR: 15-41 days] vs. 37 days [IQR: 23-52 days], p = 0.046). The incidence of positive blood cultures was higher in patients who received methylprednisolone (37.5% vs. 17.8%, p = 0.052). However, 81% of patients who received methylprednisolone also received tocilizumab. The number of days with hyperglycemia was similar in the two groups. Conclusions: Methylprednisolone was independently associated with increased VFDs and shortened hospital length of stay. The combination of methylprednisolone and tocilizumab was associated with a higher rate of positive blood cultures. Further trials are needed to evaluate the benefits and safety of methylprednisolone in moderate or severe COVID-19 ARDS.","Badr, Mohamed; De Oliveira, Bruno; Abdallah, Khaled; Nadeem, Ashraf; Varghese, Yeldho; Munde, Dnyaseshwar; Salam, Shameen; Abduljawad, Baraa; Saleh, Khaled; Elkambergy, Hussam; Taha, Ahmed; Bayrlee, Ahmed; Wahla, Ali; Dibu, Jamil; Haque, Rehan; Hamed, Fadi; Rahman, Nadeem; Mallat, Jihad",,,643

Method: The IDENTIFY study was an international, prospective, multicentre cohort study of over 11,000 patients referred to secondary care for investigation of haematuria. Using this data, we developed strategies using combinations of imaging and cytology as triage tests to maximise cancer detection within a pragmatic pathway. Results: 8112 patients (74.4%) received an ultrasound or a CT urogram, with or without cytology. 5737 (70.7%) patients had visible haematuria (VH) and 2375 (29.3%) had non-visible haematuria (NVH). Diagnostic test performance was used to determine optimal age cut-offs for four proposed strategies. We recommended proceeding directly to transurethral resection of bladder tumour for patients of any age with positive triage tests for cancer. Patients with negative triage tests under 35- years-old with VH, or under 50-years-old with NVH can safely be discharged without undergoing flexible cystoscopy. The remaining patients may undergo flexible cystoscopy, with a greater priority for older patients to capture high risk bladder cancer. Conclusions: We suggest diagnostic strategies in patients with haematuria, which focus on detection of bladder cancer, whilst reducing the burden to healthcare services in a resource-limited setting.","Anonymous,",British Journal of Surgery,,643

Demand for health care expenditure increased after the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is interesting in modeling the nexus between public and private health expenditure, carbon dioxide emissions, and economic growth. To this end, the present study analyzed the nexus between public and private health care expenditure, economic growth, and environmental pollution for 36 Asian countries for the period 1991-2017. FMOLS, GMM, and quantile regression analysis confirm the EKC hypothesis in Asia. Besides, FMOLS and quantile regressions reached the reducing effects of government and private health expenditures on CO2 emissions. While quantile regression results show that public and private health expenditures can mitigate CO2 emissions; however, these results differ for various levels of CO2. Findings of quantile regression show a significant impact of both public and private health expenditures in reducing CO2 at the 50th and 75th quantiles but results are insignificant for the 25th quantile. Overall, the paper concludes that both government and private health sectors' expenditures caused CO2 emissions to decrease in Asia and that the negative impact of the private health sector on CO2 emissions is greater than that of the government health sector. The concluding remark is that the higher the health spending, the higher the environmental quality will be in Asia. Hence, the health administrators need to increase public and private health expenditures with an effective cost-service and energy-efficient management approach to reach sustainable health services and a sustainable environment in Asia.","Bilgili, Faik; Kuskaya, Sevda; Khan, Masreka; Awan, Ashar; Türker, Oguzhan",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

313270,Een patiënt met COPD tijdens de COVID-19-pandemie,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Due to a substantial proportion of asymptomatic and mild courses, many SARS-CoV-2 infections remain unreported. Therefore, assessment of seroprevalence may detect the real burden of disease. We aimed at determining and characterizing the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and the resulting seroprevalence in a defined population. The primary objective of the study was to assess SARS-CoV-2 antibody seroprevalence using six different IgG detecting immunoassays. Secondary objectives of the study were: i.) to determine potential risk factors for symptomatic vs. asymptomatic Covid19 courses; ii.) to investigate the rate of virus RNA-persistence. METHODS: CoNAN is a population-based cohort study performed in the community Neustadt am Rennsteig, Germany that was quarantined from March 22nd to April 5th after six SARS-CoV-2 cases were detected in the villages' population. The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak compromised 51 cases and 3 deaths. The CoNAN study was performed from May 13th to May 22nd 2020 six weeks after a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. RESULTS: We enrolled a total of 626 participants (71% of the community population) for PCR- and antibody testing in the study. All actual SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were negative. Fifty-two out of 620 (8.4%) participants had antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in at least two different assays. There were 38 participants with previously PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of those, only 19 (50%) displayed anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. We also show that antibody positive participants with symptoms compatible with a respiratory tract infection had significantly higher antibody levels then asymptomatic participants (EU-assay: Median 2.9 vs. 7.2 IgG-index, p=0.002; DS-assay: Median 45.2 vs. 143 AU/mL, p=0.002). Persisting viral replication was not detected. CONCLUSIONS: Our data question the relevance and reliability of IgG antibody testing to detect past SARS-CoV-2 infections six weeks after an outbreak. We conclude that assessing immunity for SARS-CoV-2 infection should not only rely on antibody tests.","Weis, Sebastian; Scherag, André; Baier, Michael; Kiehntopf, Michael; Kamradt, Thomas; Kolanos, Steffi; Ankert, Juliane; Glöckner, Stefan; Makarewicz, Oliwia; Hagel, Stefan; Bahrs, Christina; Kimmig, Aurelia; Proquitté, Hans; Guerra, Joel; Rimek, Dagmar; Löffler, Bettina; Pletz, Mathias W",Clin. microbiol. infect,,643

This includes professional health program (PHP) monitoring of healthcare workers in recovery from substance use disorders. Here we present the case of a physician whose positive alcohol biomarker test result was complicated by a traumatic stress response to frontline work during COVID-19. METHODS: An anesthesiologist under PHP monitoring for substance use disorder and depression was interviewed extensively, urine and blood biomarkers were obtained, and longitudinal structured and semi-structured interviews related to anxiety, depression, posttraumatic stress, and cravings were used to monitor responses to the unanticipated death of a patient who succumbed to COVID-19. RESULTS: After an initial positive ethylglucuronide (EtG) and ethylsulfate (EtS) toxicology test result, all subsequent testing was negative. Standardized assessments and clinical interviews provided documentation of a post-traumatic stress reaction. The physician described compulsive sanitizing of hands/arms and mask with highly concentrated ethanol-based products. CONCLUSIONS: Inhalation of ethanol vapors is a possible explanation for the initial positive EtG/EtS results. To our knowledge, this case represents the highest reported levels of EtG/EtS likely due to workplace exposure. The importance of rapid intervention to thoroughly assess positive toxicology testing and its source(s) cannot be overstated, particularly as it relates to frontline healthcare workers during the pandemic. The PHP monitoring process provides an opportunity to promptly detect healthcare workers in distress, allowing for efficient connection to supportive resources and/or treatment when indicated, and possibly preventing escalation of symptoms or disease recurrence.","Polles, Alexis G; Jacobs, William S; Brazle, Chad; Merlo, Lisa J",Journal of addiction medicine (Online),,643

To date, there is no curative treatment for COVID-19, and with vaccines only recently being rolled out predominantly in wealthy countries, prevention still remains the main strategy. Social distancing has been proven to mitigate the epidemic and limit disease spread. As is the case in many other countries, the Ethiopian government has declared a state of emergency and taken several measures to impose social distancing. The level of compliance with social distancing measures in Ethiopia is unknown. The aim of this study was to assess the compliance, barriers, and facilitators to social distancing measures for the prevention of COVID-19 in Northwest Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional survey using telephone interview triangulated by a qualitative study was conducted over a period of one month from April 20th to May 20th, 2020 at the University of Gondar Hospital in Gondar, Ethiopia. A total of 401 randomly selected participants, and 12 key representative informants selected by convenience were included for the quantitative and qualitative studies, respectively. Information on socio-demographic factors, knowledge about COVID-19, and practices concerning preventive measures--particularly social distancing--was collected.

P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant, and a confidence level of 95% strength of association was used. Results: A total of 425 study subjects were approached and 401 responded positively (response rate of 94.4%). Of the 401 study participants, 55.4% (95% CI 50.4, 60.2) reported poor compliance with social distancing measures. The mean age of the participants was 36.4 years (SD ± 11.8). The majority of participants (63.84%) reported that they went to crowded places without putting on a face mask. Of the participants, 243 (60.6%) and 306 (76.3%) had good knowledge on COVID-19 transmission and prevention, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that only age (AOR= 1.02, 95% CI: 1.00-1.04) was significantly associated with social distancing measures, with older persons more likely than younger to comply with social distancing guidelines. Conclusion: The majority of the study's participants reported poor compliance with social distancing measures set by the government and health authorities. Reported compliance with social distancing measures was increased with increasing age.","Hailu, Workagegnehu; Derseh, Lemma; Hunegnaw, Melkamu Tamir; Tesfaye, Tsebaot; Abebaw, Dessie",Curr Ther Res Clin Exp,,643

318412,Resposta ao artigo “O que a medicina social latino-americana pode contribuir para os debates globais sobre as políticas da Covid-19: lições do Brasil”,2021,"The nutrient-sensing mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is integral to cell fate decisions after T cell activation. Sustained mTORC1 activity favors the generation of terminally differentiated effector T cells instead of follicular helper and memory T cells. This is particularly pertinent for T cell responses of older adults who have sustained mTORC1 activation despite dysfunctional lysosomes. Here, we show that lysosome-deficient T cells rely on late endosomes rather than lysosomes as an mTORC1 activation platform, where mTORC1 is activated by sensing cytosolic amino acids. T cells from older adults have an increased expression of the plasma membrane leucine transporter SLC7A5 to provide a cytosolic amino acid source. Hence, SLC7A5 and VPS39 deficiency (a member of the HOPS complex promoting early to late endosome conversion) substantially reduced mTORC1 activities in T cells from older but not young individuals. Late endosomal mTORC1 is independent of the negative-feedback loop involving mTORC1-induced inactivation of the transcription factor TFEB that controls expression of lysosomal genes. The resulting sustained mTORC1 activation impaired lysosome function and prevented lysosomal degradation of PD-1 in CD4+ T cells from older adults, thereby inhibiting their proliferative responses. VPS39 silencing of human T cells improved their expansion to pertussis and to SARS-CoV-2 peptides in vitro. Furthermore, adoptive transfer of CD4+ Vps39-deficient LCMV-specific SMARTA cells improved germinal center responses, CD8+ memory T cell generation, and recall responses to infection. Thus, curtailing late endosomal mTORC1 activity is a promising strategy to enhance T cell immunity.","Jin, Jun; Kim, Chulwoo; Xia, Qiong; Gould, Timothy M; Cao, Wenqiang; Zhang, Huimin; Li, Xuanying; Weiskopf, Daniela; Grifoni, Alba; Sette, Alessandro; Weyand, Cornelia M; Goronzy, Jorg J",Sci. immunol,,643

The PU was synthesized from polycaprolactone diol, hexamethylene diisocyanate, and dimethylolpropionic acid (DMPA) chain extender using two-step polymerization and designated as PU-DMPA. A control PU using 1,4-butanediol (1,4-BDO) as a chain extender was synthesized similarly and designated as PU-BDO. The chemical structure of the two PUs was verified by FT-IR and 1H-NMR. The PU-DMPA had a lower molecular weight than the PU-BDO (~16,700 Da vs. ~78,600 Da). The melting enthalpy of the PU-DMPA was greater than that of the PU-BDO. Both the PUs exhibited elastomeric behaviors with a comparable elongation at break (λ=L/L0= 13.2). The PU-DMPA had a higher initial modulus (19.8 MPa vs. 8.7 MPa) and a lower linear modulus (0.7 MPa vs. 1.2 MPa) and ultimate strength (9.5 MPa vs. 13.8 MPa) than the PU-BDO. The PU-DMPA had better hydrophilicity than the PU-BDO. Both the PUs displayed no cytotoxicity, although the adhesion of human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells on the PU-DMPA surface was better. Bead free electrospun PU-DMPA membranes with a narrow fiber diameter distribution were successfully fabricated. As a demonstration of its functionalizability, gelatin was conjugated to the electrospun PU-DMPA membrane using carbodiimide chemistry. Moreover, hyaluronic acid was immobilized on the amino-functionalized PU-DMPA. In conclusion, the PU-DMPA has the potential to be used as a scaffold material for soft tissue engineering.","Jin-Jia, Hu Liu Chia-Chi Lin Chih-Hsun Ho-Yi Tuan-Mu",Polymers,,643

This disease is caused by the novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, also known as the novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). A custom convolutional neural network and a selection of ImageNet pretrained models are trained and evaluated at patient-level on publicly available CXR collections to learn modality-specific feature representations. The learned knowledge is transferred and fine-tuned to improve performance and generalization in the related task of classifying CXRs as normal, showing bacterial pneumonia, or COVID-19-viral abnormalities. The best performing models are iteratively pruned to reduce complexity and improve memory efficiency. The predictions of the best-performing pruned models are combined through different ensemble strategies to improve classification performance. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the weighted average of the best-performing pruned models significantly improves performance resulting in an accuracy of 99.01% and area under the curve of 0.9972 in detecting COVID-19 findings on CXRs. The combined use of modality-specific knowledge transfer, iterative model pruning, and ensemble learning resulted in improved predictions.

This paper describes the phenomenon from the perspectives of a sample of adolescents with obesity enrolled in an inpatients' multidisciplinary rehabilitation program for weight-loss and their caregivers, and its impact on different life domains. Individual semi-structured ad hoc interviews were conducted with 10 adolescent-caregiver dyads, and narratives were qualitatively investigated using an interpretative phenomenology approach to data. Twenty participants took part in the study. The major themes that emerged from this study fall into five basic categories: (1) COVID-19 as an opportunity to reconsider what makes a good life; (2) Persistence in life; (3) Empowering relationship; (4) Daily routine in quarantine; (5) Lives on hold.

The goal of this study was to characterize these self-reported efforts by the pediatric simulation community. DESIGN: This was a global, multicenter survey developed via a Delphi process. SETTING: International survey study. SUBJECTS: The survey was sent to 555 individual members of the three largest international pediatric simulation societies (The International Pediatric Simulation Society, International Network for Simulation-based Pediatric Innovation, Research & Education, and Netzwerk Kindersimulation e.V.) between April 27, 2020, and May 18, 2020. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Description of coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic simulation-based preparation activities of pediatric acute and critical care healthcare providers. The Delphi process included 20 content experts and required three rounds to reach consensus. The survey was completed by 234 participants (42.2%) from 19 countries. Preparation differed significantly between the geographic regions, with 79.3% of Anglo-American/Anglo-Saxon, 82.6% of Indian, and 47.1% of European participants initiating specifically coronavirus disease 2019-related simulation activities. Frequent modifications to existing simulation programs included the use of telesimulation and virtual reality training. Forty-nine percent of institutions discontinued noncoronavirus disease 2019-related simulation training. CONCLUSIONS: The swift incorporation of disease-specific sessions and the transition of standard education to virtual or hybrid simulation training modes occurred frequently. The approach used, however, depended heavily on local requirements, limitations, and circumstances. In particular, the use of telesimulation allowed education to continue while maintaining social distancing requirements.","Wagner, Michael; Jaki, Chistina; Löllgen, Ruth M; Mileder, Lukas; Eibensteiner, Fabian; Ritschl, Valentin; Steinbauer, Philipp; Gottstein, Maximilian; Abulebda, Kamal; Calhoun, Aaron; Gross, Isabel T",Pediatric critical care medicine,,643

We further provide a fresh perspective on potential hedging and diversification benefits of AI & Robotics stocks. Overall, our results suggest that co-movements between AI & Robotics stocks and other assets significantly depend on the wavelet decomposition levels, suggesting time-scale-dependent investment benefits. Wavelet coherences and correlations have substantially increased, mostly in the low frequencies, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Government securities exhibit safe haven properties for investors at the highest and lowest scales. Even if cryptocurrencies can provide hedging benefits over the full sample, these benefits seem to be diminished during the COVID-19 period. We observe substantially higher co-movements of AI stocks with the composite stock index, corporate bonds, and commodities at all scales after March 2020, implying that inclusion of these assets in AI & Robotics stock portfolios may not enhance risk-adjusted portfolio performance in times of market turbulence. These results offer potential implications for investors and portfolio managers in terms of hedging/diversification benefits as well as for authorities and policy makers regarding the development of strategies to mitigate financial risk.","Demiralay, Sercan Gencer Hatice Gaye Bayraci Selcuk",Technological Forecasting and Social Change,,643

The entire humanity has to fight in this war against the unexpected and each and every individual role is important. Healthcare system is doing exceptional work and the government is taking various measures that help the society to control the spread. Public, on the other hand, coordinates with the policies and act accordingly in most state of affairs. But the role of technologies in assisting different social bodies to fight against the pandemic remains hidden. The intention of our study is to uncover the hidden roles of technologies that ultimately help for controlling the pandemic. On investigating, it is found that the strategies utilizing potential technologies would yield better benefits and these technological strategies can be framed either to control the pandemic or to support the confinement of the society during pandemic which in turn aids in controlling the spreading of infection. This study enlightens the various implemented technologies that assists the healthcare systems, government and public in diverse aspects for fighting against COVID-19. Furthermore, the technological swift that happened during the pandemic and their influence in the environment and society is discussed. Besides the implemented technologies, this work also deals with untapped potential technologies that have prospective applications in controlling the pandemic circumstances.

While three-layer masks are generally advised, many commonly available or makeshift masks contain single or double layers. Using carefully designed experiments involving high-speed imaging along with physics-based analysis, we show that high-momentum, large-sized (>250 micrometer) surrogate cough droplets can penetrate single- or double-layer mask material to a significant extent. The penetrated droplets can atomize into numerous much smaller (<100 micrometer) droplets, which could remain airborne for a significant time. The possibility of secondary atomization of high-momentum cough droplets by hydrodynamic focusing and extrusion through the microscale pores in the fibrous network of the single/double-layer mask material needs to be considered in determining mask efficacy. Three-layer masks can effectively block these droplets and thus could be ubiquitously used as a key tool against COVID-19 or similar respiratory diseases.","Sharma, Shubham; Pinto, Roven; Saha, Abhishek; Chaudhuri, Swetaprovo; Basu, Saptarshi",Sci.

Of the 330 cases of severe COVID-19 in double-vaccinated individuals, 47% had moderate risk conditions and 41% were CEV. In the double-vaccinated CEV group, the rate ratio for severe disease (with no risk condition as reference category) was highest in solid organ transplants at 98 (95% CI 29 to 332) but even in this subgroup the absolute risk of severe COVID-19 was low (14 cases in 16079 person-months of follow-up). ConclusionsTwo doses of vaccine protect against severe COVID-19 in CEV individuals but the residual risk in double-vaccinated individuals remains far higher in those who are CEV than in those who are not. These results suggest that any policy of offering booster doses to doubly-vaccinated individuals should focus initially on the clinically vulnerable, and lay a basis for determining eligibility for passive immunization to protect those at highest risk.","McKeigue, Paul M; McAllister, David; Robertson, Chris; Hutchinson, Sharon J; McGurnaghan, Stuart; Stockton, Diane; Colhoun, Helen M",,,643

In this paper, we investigated the reproductive toxicity of these pollutants using a C. elegans model to evaluate spermatogenesis throughout the entire developmental cycle of him-5 mutant by exposing to 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1 mmol/L PFOS or PFOA for 48 h. Experimental results suggested that PFOS and PFOA exposure led to reductions in brood size, germ cell number, spermatid size, and motility, and increases in rate of malformation spermatids. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that exposure to PFOS resulted in higher levels of damage than PFOA in germ cells only in 0.001 mmol/L exposure group. RT-qPCR was used to further investigate the expression of genes associated with different stages of spermatogenesis, such as mitosis and meiosis, fibrous body-membranous organelles (FB-MOs), and sperm activation. The expression levels of wee-1.3, spe-4, spe-6, and spe-17 genes were increased, while those of puf-8, spe-10, fer-1, swm-1, try-5, and spe-15 genes were decreased. Our results suggesting that PFOS or PFOA may cause spermatogenesis damage by disrupting the mitotic proliferation, meiotic entry, formation of the MOs, fusion of the MOs and plasma membrane (PM), and pseudopods. Loss-of-function studies using puf-8 and spe-10 mutants revealed spe-10 gene was specifically involved in PFOS- or PFOA-induced reproductive toxicity via regulating one or more critical palmitoylation events, while puf-8 gene was not direct target of PFOS and PFOA, and PFOS and PFOA may act on the upstream gene of puf-8, thus affecting reproductive ability. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential adverse impact of PFOS and PFOA exposure on spermatogenesis and provide valuable data for PFC risk assessment.

Though major symptoms are primarily generated from the respiratory system, neurological symptoms are being reported in some of the confirmed cases, raising concerns of its potential for intracranial invasion and neurological manifestations, both in the acute phase and in the long-term. At present, it remains unclear the extent to which SARS-CoV-2 is present in the brain, and if so, its pathogenic role in the central nervous system (CNS). Evidence for neuroinvasion and neurovirulence of hCoVs has been recognised in animal and human studies. Given that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the same family and shares characteristics in terms of receptor binding properties, it is worthwhile exploring its potential CNS manifestations. This review summarises previous findings from hCoVs in relation to the CNS, and compares these with the new strain, aiming to provide a better understanding of the effects of SARS-CoV-2 on the CNS.","Cheng, Qi; Yang, Yue; Gao, Jianqun",EBioMedicine,,643

Self-collected swab techniques can overcome many of the disadvantages of a nasopharyngeal swab, but they require evaluation. METHODS: Three self-collected non-nasopharyngeal swab techniques (saline gargle, oral swab and combined oral-anterior nasal swab) were compared to a nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 detection at multiple COVID-19 assessment centers in Toronto, Canada. The performance characteristics of each test were assessed. RESULTS: The adjusted sensitivity of the saline gargle was 0.90 (95% CI 0.86-0.94), the oral swab was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.72-0.89) and the combined oral-anterior nasal swab was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.77-0.93) compared to a nasopharyngeal swab, which demonstrated a sensitivity of Ë90% when all positive tests were the reference standard. The median cycle threshold values for the SARS-CoV-2 E-gene for concordant and discordant saline gargle specimens were 17 and 31 (P < .001), for the oral swabs these values were 17 and 28 (P < .001), and for oral-anterior nasal swabs these values were 18 and 31 (P = .007). CONCLUSIONS: Self-collected saline gargle and an oral-anterior nasal swab have a similar sensitivity to a nasopharyngeal swab for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. These alternative collection techniques are cheap and can eliminate barriers to testing, particularly in underserved populations.","Kandel, Christopher E; Young, Matthew; Serbanescu, Mihaela Anca; Powis, Jeff E; Bulir, David; Callahan, James; Katz, Kevin; McCready, Janine; Racher, Hilary; Sheldrake, Elena; Quon, Dorothy; Vojdani, Omid Kyle; McGeer, Allison; Goneau, Lee W; Vermeiren, Christie",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,643

However, this specification depends on two parameters only, which implies a lack of flexibility and the difficulty to replicate the volatile reproduction numbers observed in practice. We extend the classic SIR model by introducing nonlinear stochastic transmission, to get a stochastic SIR model. We derive its exact solution and discuss the condition for herd immunity. The stochastic SIR model corresponds to a population of infinite size. When the population size is finite, there is also sampling uncertainty. We propose a state-space framework under which we analyze the relative magnitudes of the observational and stochastic epidemiological uncertainties during the evolution of the epidemic. We also emphasize the lack of robustness of the notion of herd immunity when the SIR model is time discretized.","Gourieroux, Christian; Lu, Yang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.07816v1.pdf,643

Since the first case was recorded on December 29, 2019, in Wuhan of China, the disease has rapidly extended to other nations of the world to claim many lives, especially in the USA, the United Kingdom, and Western Europe. To stay ahead of the curve consequent of the continued increase in case and mortality, predictive tools are needed to guide adequate response. Therefore, this study aims to determine the best predictive models and investigate the impact of lockdown policy on the USA' COVID-19 incidence and mortality. This study focuses on the statistical modelling of the USA daily COVID-19 incidence and mortality cases based on some intuitive properties of the data such as overdispersion and autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity. The impact of the lockdown policy on cases and mortality was assessed by comparing the USA incidence case with that of Sweden where there is no strict lockdown. Stochastic models based on negative binomial autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity [NB INGARCH (p,q)], the negative binomial regression, the autoregressive integrated moving average model with exogenous variables (ARIMAX) and without exogenous variables (ARIMA) models of several orders are presented, to identify the best fitting model for the USA daily incidence cases. The performance of the optimal NB INGARCH model on daily incidence cases was compared with the optimal ARIMA model in terms of their Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). Also, the NB model, ARIMA model and without exogenous variables are formulated for USA daily COVID-19 death cases. It was observed that the incidence and mortality cases show statistically significant increasing trends over the study period. The USA daily COVID-19 incidence is autocorrelated, linear and contains a structural break but exhibits autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity. Observed data are compared with the fitted data from the optimal models. The results further indicate that the NB INGARCH fits the observed incidence better than ARIMA while the NB models perform better than the optimal ARIMA and ARIMAX models for death counts in terms of AIC and root mean square error (RMSE). The results show a statistically significant relationship between the lockdown policy in the USA and incidence and death counts. This suggests the efficacy of the lockdown policy in the USA.","Makinde, Olusola S; Adeola, Abiodun M; Abiodun, Gbenga J; Olusola-Makinde, Olubukola O; Alejandro, Aceves",Journal of epidemiology and global health (Online),,643

We present the first case in the literature of craniectomy procedure and asportation of a solitary cerebellar metastasis of the oesophagus squamous carcinoma in a 77 years old woman COVID-19 positive. In these particular circumstances, we show that adequate healthcare resources and risk assessments are essential in the management of COVID-19 patients referred to emergency surgery. Presentation of case: The case here presented was treated in 2019 for squamous carcinoma of the oesophagus. In April 2020, she presented a deterioration of her clinical picture consisting of dysphagia, abdominal pain, hyposthenia and ataxia. A Head CT scan was performed, which showed the presence of a solitary cerebellar metastasis. Her associated SARS-CoV-2 positivity status represented the principal clinical concern throughout her hospitalisation. Discussion: The patient underwent a suboccipital craniectomy procedure with metastasis asportation. She tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the pre- and post-operative phases, but she was not admitted to the intensive care unit because she did not present any respiratory complications. Her vital parameters and inflammation indexes fell within the reference ranges, and she was kept in isolation for 16 days in our neurosurgical unit following strict COVID-19 measures. She was asymptomatic and not treated for any of the specific and non-specific symptoms of COVID-19. Conclusion: This is the first case reported of solitary cerebellar metastasis of oesophagus carcinoma operated on a COVID-19 positive patient. It shows that asymptomatic COVID-19 positive patients can undergo major emergency surgeries without the risk of infecting the operating team if adequate Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) is used. The patient remained asymptomatic and did not develop the disease's active phase despite undergoing a stressful event such as a major emergency neurosurgical procedure. In the current crisis, a prophylactic COVID-19 screening test can identify asymptomatic patients undergoing major emergency surgery and adequate resource planning and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for healthcare workers can minimise the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Lapolla, Pierfrancesco; Familiari, Pietro; Bruzzaniti, Placido; Arcese, Roberto; Matassa, Roberto; Frati, Alessandro; D039,; Andrea, Giancarlo; Santoro, Antonio",Int J Surg Case Rep,,643

363774,The impact of face masks on children-A mini review,2021,"Coronavirus (COVID-19) is a humanitarian emergency, which started in Wuhan in China in early December 2019, brought into the notice of the authorities in late December, early January 2020, and, after investigation, was declared as an emergency in the third week of January 2020. The WHO declared this as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 31th of January 2020, and finally a pandemic on 11th March 2020. As of March 24th, 2020, the virus has caused a casualty of over 16,600 people worldwide with more than 380,000 people confirmed as infected by it, of which more than 10,000 cases are serious. Mainly based on Chinese newspapers, social media and other digital platform data, this paper analyzes the timeline of the key actions taken by the government and people over three months in five different phases. It found that although there was an initial delay in responding, a unique combination of strong governance, strict regulation, strong community vigilance and citizen participation, and wise use of big data and digital technologies, were some of the key factors in China's efforts to combat this virus. Being inviable and non-measurable (unlike radioactive exposure), appropriate and timely information is very important to form the basic foundation of mitigation and curative measures. Infodemic, as it is termed by WHO, is a key word, where different stakeholder's participation, along with stricter regulation, is required to reduce the impact of fake news in this information age and social media. Although different countries will need different approaches, focusing on its humanitarian nature and addressing infodemic issues are the two critical factors for future global mitigation efforts.","Hua, Jinling; Shaw, Rajib",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,643
364077,Lung Ultrasound in Children with COVID-19: Preliminary Findings,2020,"Bike sharing, as an important component of urban public transportation, has played a more important role during the COVID-19 pandemic because users could ride bikes in open space and avoid the risk of infection. Leveraging the trip data of the Divvy bike sharing system in Chicago, this study sets to explore the change of ridership that COVID-19 has brought and the built environment factors that influence the spatial variation of ridership under the pandemic. Results show that the ridership declines by xx% in total. To account for the spatially heterogeneous relationship between the built environment and the ridership, the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model and the semi-parametric GWR (S-GWR) model are constructed. By comparing the model results, we find that the S-GWR model outperforms the GWR and the multiple linear regression model. The results of the S-GWR model indicates that education employment density, distance to subway, COVID-19 cases and ridership before COVID-19 are global variables. The ridership between residential density, office employment density and the ridership vary across space. The results of this study could provide useful reference to transportation planners and bike sharing operators to determine the high bike sharing demand area under the pandemic and to make adjustment on the locations and capacity of the stations and the rebalancing schemes accordingly.","Yang, Hongtai; Guo, Zishuo; Huo, Jinghai; Yang, Linchuan",,,643

Concerns exist about sensitivity and false-negative SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing results. We describe a retrospective observational study examining the utility of repeat nasopharyngeal (NP) SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing at an academic center in a low-prevalence setting. Methods: All patients within our health system with >1 NP SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test result were included. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing was performed according to 1 of 4 validated assays. Key clinical and demographic data were collected, including whether the patient was inpatient or outpatient at time of the test and whether the test was performed as part of a person under investigation (PUI) for possible coronavirus disease 2019 or for asymptomatic screening. Results: A total of 660 patients had >1 NP SARS-CoV-2 PCR test performed. The initial test was negative in 638. There were only 6 negative-to-positive conversions (0.9%). All 6 were outpatients undergoing a PUI workup 5-17 days after an initial negative result. In >260 inpatients with repeat testing, we found no instances of negative-to-positive conversion including those undergoing PUI or asymptomatic evaluation. Conclusions: In a low-prevalence area, repeat inpatient testing after an initial negative result, using a highly analytically sensitive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR, failed to demonstrate negative-to-positive conversion. The clinical sensitivity of NP RT-PCR testing may be higher than previously believed. These results have helped shape diagnostic stewardship guidelines, in particular guidance to decrease repeated testing in the inpatient setting to optimize test utilization and preserve resources.","Lepak, Alexander J; Chen, Derrick J; Buys, Ashley; Stevens, Linda; Safdar, Nasia",Open Forum Infect Dis,,643

The study also examined routinely collected activity data for the chronic disease programs before COVID (January-February 2020) and for the first 3 months of the COVID-19 response (March-May 2020).ResultsChronic disease programs continued to provide similar numbers of appointments over the COVID-19 response period, but there was a marked increase in the proportion of appointments that were delivered virtually, either by telephone or video conference. Most patients were satisfied with their virtual care experiences and felt that their health care needs were met.ConclusionsThe COVID-19 response provided an opportunity to learn and further develop models of virtual care. Staff and patients were generally supportive of continuing to include virtual appointments in the future. Ongoing concerns were predominantly around the support available to patients and staff to ensure they are trained and equipped to manage the technology and new mode of communicating.What is known about the topic?Emerging evidence suggests that virtual models of health care delivery, such as telephone and video consultations and remote patient monitoring, can be safe and cost-effective alternatives to traditional face-to-face chronic disease management programs. Virtual care is associated with equal or improved clinical outcomes, as well as efficiency improvements, such as reduced failure to attend rates.What does this paper add?The increasing burden of chronic disease across Australia, as well as the need to minimise the risk of vulnerable patient groups attending in-hospital appointments where it is safe and appropriate to do so, means that expanding the delivery of virtual chronic disease management will become increasingly necessary. The results of this study provide an opportunity to learn from a rapid rollout of virtual care for these staff and patient groups and will help inform advances in this area.What are the implications for practitioners?Existing evidence, demographic pressures and the COVID-19 pandemic response all point to virtual care as a viable and safe alternative to traditional models of chronic disease management. The lessons presented here provide more detailed guidance on the support that staff and patients require to ensure virtual care is a seamless and safe alternative or adjunct to traditional chronic disease management programs.","Smithson, Rachael; Roche, Elisha; Wicker, Christina",,,643

However, this assumed data generation process can be unrealistic, since data sources for epidemics are often aggregated across geographic regions and communities. As a result, state-of-the-art models for estimating epidemiological parameters, e.g.~transmission rates, can be inappropriate when faced with complex systems. Our work empirically demonstrates some limitations of applying epidemiological models to aggregated datasets. We generate three complex outbreak scenarios by combining incidence curves from multiple epidemics that are independently simulated via SEIR models with different sets of parameters. Using these scenarios, we assess the robustness of a state-of-the-art Bayesian inference method that estimates the epidemic trajectory from viral load surveillance data. We evaluate two data-generating models within this Bayesian inference framework: a simple exponential growth model and a highly flexible Gaussian process prior model. Our results show that both models generate accurate transmission rate estimates for the combined incidence curve at the cost of generating biased estimates for each underlying epidemic, reflecting highly heterogeneous underlying population dynamics. The exponential growth model, while interpretable, is unable to capture the complexity of the underlying epidemics. With sufficient surveillance data, the Gaussian process prior model captures the shape of complex trajectories, but is imprecise for periods of low data coverage. Thus, our results highlight the potential pitfalls of neglecting complexity and heterogeneity in the data generation process, which can mask underlying location- and population-specific epidemic dynamics.","Trella, Anna L.; Argaw, Peniel N.; Li, Michelle M.; Hay, James A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10610v1.pdf,643
372059,El médico frente a la COVID-19: lecciones de una pandemia,2020,"BACKGROUND: Since the first cases of COVID-19 were reported in Wuhan, the nutritional status of individuals infected with the virus has not been included in the risk profiles prepared. However, nutritional status, along with other factors, is decisive in the evolution of patients with other infectious diseases. The nutritional status of individuals is considered an indicator of health status. Furthermore, optimal nutritional status transcends the individual, and poor diet in a population can be considered a group risk factor. Evidence exists on the influence that diet has on the immune system and susceptibility to disease. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the nutritional status of patients older than 65 years who were admitted due to COVID-19 and how this has influenced the evolution of patients. DESIGN: This prospective and observational study was performed in patients with COVID-19 infection confirmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Data were collected from the first 24 h of admission. All patients admitted during one month to the wards assigned to COVID-19 infection were included. RESULTS: A total of 83 patients were studied. The statistical study of mortality showed associations with age (p = .005), living in a nursing home (p = .022), a high Charlson Comorbidity Index (p = .039), hypertension (p = .032), comorbidities of dementia (p = .019) and cerebral vascular disease (p = .041), and Barthel Index (p = .010). The analysis of the influence of the nutritional state on mortality revealed a statistical association between malnutrition and mortality in the pooled data analysis (p = .005) and analysis by degrees of malnutrition (p = .27). CONCLUSIONS: Malnutrition was a risk factor as powerful as others such as hypertension, age, and different comorbidities. We must evaluate and treat the nutritional status of elderly patients with COVID-19 infection since it directly affects their evolution.","Abadía Otero, Jessica; Briongos Figuero, Laisa Socorro; Gabella Mattín, Miriam; Usategui Martín, Iciar; Cubero Morais, Pablo; Cuellar Olmedo, Luis; Inglada Galiana, Luis; Dueñas Gutiérrez, Carlos; Carretero Gómez, Juana; Corral Gudino, Luis; Miramontes González, José Pablo",Curr Med Res Opin,,643

The Utah Department of Health (UDOH) analyzed COVID-19 surveillance data to describe workplace outbreaks by industry sectors. In this report, workplaces refer to non-health care, noncongregate-living, and noneducational settings. As of June 5, 2020, UDOH reported 277 COVID-19 outbreaks, 210 (76%) of which occurred in workplaces. Approximately 12% (1,389 of 11,448) of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Utah were associated with workplace outbreaks. The 210 workplace outbreaks occurred in 15 of 20 industry sectors;* nearly one half of all workplace outbreaks occurred in three sectors: Manufacturing (43; 20%), Construction (32; 15%) and Wholesale Trade (29; 14%); 58% (806 of 1,389) of workplace outbreak-associated cases occurred in these three sectors. Although 24% of Utah's workforce in all 15 affected sectors identified as Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) or a race other than non-Hispanic white (nonwhite) (1), 73% (970 of 1,335) of workplace outbreak-associated COVID-19 cases were in persons who identified as Hispanic or nonwhite. Systemic social inequities have resulted in the overrepresentation of Hispanic and nonwhite workers in frontline occupations where exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, might be higher (2); extra vigilance in these sectors is needed to ensure prevention and mitigation strategies are applied equitably and effectively to workers of racial and ethnic groups disproportionately affected by COVID-19. Health departments can adapt workplace guidance to each industry sector affected by COVID-19 to account for different production processes and working conditions.","Bui, David P; McCaffrey, Keegan; Friedrichs, Michael; LaCross, Nathan; Lewis, Nathaniel M; Sage, Kylie; Barbeau, Bree; Vilven, Dede; Rose, Carolyn; Braby, Sara; Willardson, Sarah; Carter, Amy; Smoot, Christopher; Winquist, Andrea; Dunn, Angela",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,643

DESIGN: Single-centre, retrospective, observational study. PATIENTS: COVID-19 patients undergoing rehabilitation (24 April to 24 May 2020). METHODS: All COVID-19 inpatients undergoing rehabilitation in the general ward were assessed. Data were collected on age, sex, physical ability, rehabilitation modality (remote/direct), need for intubation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, degree of pneumonia, oxygen therapy from the start of rehabilitation, D-dimer and C-reactive protein levels, and rehabilitation-related complications. Activities of daily living were measured using the Barthel Index. RESULTS: Out of a total of 43 patients, 14 were initially provided with remote rehabilitation and 29 with direct rehabilitation. Four patients were switched from direct to remote rehabilitation during the study, thus at the end of the study there were 18 in the remote rehabilitation group and 25 in the direct rehabilitation group. Patients in remote rehabilitation were significantly younger than those in direct rehabilitation. Of 12 patients who required intubation, 3 were given remote rehabilitation. One extracorporeal membrane oxygenation survivor underwent direct rehabilitation. All patients on remote rehabilitation were discharged home or to a hotel. Twelve out of 29 patients were transferred to a rehabilitation hospital due to delayed recovery of activities of daily living. No serious adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION: Effective and safe remote rehabilitation was performed in 41.9% of COVID-19 patients in this study, which resulted in improved rehabilitation in COVID-19 zones.","Sakai, Tomoko; Hoshino, Chisato; Yamaguchi, Reiko; Hirao, Masanobu; Nakahara, Rui; Okawa, Atsushi",J Rehabil Med,,643

Although susceptible to infection, recent evidence indicates mostly asymptomatic or mild presentation of the disease in infants, children, and adolescents. Similar observations were made for acute respiratory infections caused by other coronaviruses (severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome). These observations suggest that the immune system behaves differently in children than adults. Recent developments in the field demonstrated fundamental differences in the neonatal immune system as compared with adults, whereby infants respond to microorganisms through biased immune tolerance rather than resistance strategies. Similarly, more frequent/recent vaccinations in children and younger populations may result in trained immunity. Therefore, the physiological abundance of certain immunosuppressive cells, a tightly regulated immune system, and/or exposure to attenuated vaccines may enhance trained immunity to limit excessive immune reaction to COVID-19 in the young.","Elahi, Shokrollah",J Immunol,,643

Risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection among children remain poorly defined. Objective: To evaluate the association between asthma and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection among children. Design: Retrospective cohort study Setting: A large, integrated health system in central North Carolina. Participants: Children 5 to 17 years of age with a Durham County address and at least one health care encounter in the Duke University Health System between March 1, 2017, and February 28, 2020. Exposure: Diagnosis of asthma Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was SARS-CoV-2 infection identified by PCR testing of a respiratory sample collected between March 1, 2020, and October 31, 2020. We matched children with asthma 1:1 to children without asthma using propensity scores and used Poisson regression to evaluate the association between asthma and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. We assessed for effect modification of this association by inhaled corticosteroid prescription and comorbid atopic diseases. Results: Of 49,455 children, 6,515 (13%) met criteria for a diagnosis of asthma; all children with asthma were matched to a control child without asthma for a final cohort of 13,030 children. Median (interquartile range) age was 11.0 (8.0, 14.0) years, 56% were male, and 78% were non-White. A diagnosis of asthma was associated with a decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection [risk ratio (RR): 0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.49-0.92]. This association tended to be stronger in children with asthma who were prescribed inhaled corticosteroids (RR: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.38-0.94) or who had comorbid atopic diseases (RR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.39-0.88). Of the 66 children with asthma who developed SARS-CoV-2 infection, none required hospitalization for COVID-19. Conclusions and Relevance: Children with asthma had a lower risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly children prescribed an inhaled corticosteroid or with comorbid atopic diseases.

We draw on a lens of structural injustice informed by critical theory and Black feminist scholarship to critically interrogate several widely-studied and widely-adopted categories of educational AI systems and demonstrate how educational AI technologies are bound up in and reproduce historical legacies of structural injustice and inequity, regardless of the parity of their models' performance.

Case reports and autopsy series have revealed that most patients with COVID-19 - associated acute kidney injury have evidence of acute tubular injury and necrosis - not unexpected in critically ill patients. Others have been found to have collapsing glomerulopathy, thrombotic microangiopathy and diverse underlying kidney diseases. A primary kidney pathology related to COVID-19 has not yet emerged. Thus far direct infection of the kidney, or its impact on clinical disease remains controversial. The management of AKI is currently supportive. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient presented here was positive for SARS-CoV-2, had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome and multi-organ failure. Within days of admission to the intensive care unit he developed oliguric acute kidney failure requiring dialysis. Acute kidney injury developed in the setting of hemodynamic instability, sepsis and a maculopapular rash. Over the ensuing days the patient also developed transfusion-requiring severe hemolysis which was Coombs negative. Schistocytes were present on the peripheral smear. Given the broad differential diagnoses for acute kidney injury, a kidney biopsy was performed and revealed granulomatous tubulo-interstitial nephritis with some acute tubular injury. Based on the biopsy findings, a decision was taken to adjust medications and initiate corticosteroids for presumed medication-induced interstitial nephritis, hemolysis and maculo-papular rash. The kidney function and hemolysis improved over the subsequent days and the patient was discharged to a rehabilitation facility, no-longer required dialysis. CONCLUSIONS: Acute kidney injury in patients with severe COVID-19 may have multiple causes. We present the first case of granulomatous interstitial nephritis in a patient with COVID-19. Drug-reactions may be more frequent than currently recognized in COVID-19 and are potentially reversible. The kidney biopsy findings in this case led to a change in therapy, which was associated with subsequent patient improvement. Kidney biopsy may therefore have significant value in pulling together a clinical diagnosis, and may impact outcome if a treatable cause is identified.","Szajek, Katarzyna; Kajdi, Marie-Elisabeth; Luyckx, Valerie A; Fehr, Thomas Hans; Gaspert, Ariana; Cusini, Alexia; Hohloch, Karin; Grosse, Philipp",BMC Nephrol,,643

The attachment of the virus with the cell-surface receptor and a cofactor is the first step for the infection. Here, bioinformatics approaches combining human-virus protein interaction prediction and protein docking based on crystal structures have revealed the high affinity between human dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP4) and the spike (S) receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. Intriguingly, the crucial binding residues of DPP4 are identical to those that are bound to the MERS-CoV-S. Moreover, E484 insertion and adjacent substitutions should be most essential for this DPP4-binding ability acquirement of SARS-CoV-2-S compared with SARS-CoV-S. This potential utilization of DPP4 as a binding target for SARS-CoV-2 may offer novel insight into the viral pathogenesis and help the surveillance and therapeutics strategy for meeting the challenge of COVID-19.","Li, Yu; Zhang, Ziding; Yang, Li; Lian, Xianyi; Xie, Yan; Li, Shen; Xin, Shuyu; Cao, Pengfei; Lu, Jianhong",iScience,,643

Therefore, there is a clear need for identifying effective therapeutic options and a review of secondary metabolites related to Brazilian herbal medicines was performed as a strategy for the discovery of new antiviral agents. To confirm this potential, an in silico screening of the identified compounds identified was also evaluated. The review was performed by the PubMed database and the selected natural compounds were subjected to in silico analysis such as QSAR, molecular docking and ADMET. 497 secondary metabolites were identified from 23 species. The in silico assays indicated 19 potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds, being triterpenes and phenolic compounds. The indicated compounds showed a high affinity with proteins considered as the main molecular targets against SARS-CoV-2 and parameters indicated low toxicity. In addition to Brazilian medicinal plants, these compounds can be found in other species and they can be a base for the synthesis of other anti-COVID-19 drugs. Therefore, this review is important to conduct researches that address the emerging need for drugs in COVID-19 treatment.","Amparo, Tatiane R; Seibert, Janaína B; Almeida, Tamires C; Costa, Fernanda S F; Silveira, Benila M; da Silva, Glenda N; Dos Santos, Orlando D H; de Souza, Gustavo H B",Phytother. res,,643

398202,"Covid-19, la notion d'empathie est-elle a reinterroger ?",2020,"Reduced mechanical loading results in atrophy of skeletal muscle fibers. Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) are causal in sarcolemmal dislocation of nNOS and FoxO3a activation. The Nox2 isoform of NADPH oxidase and mitochondria release ROS during disuse in skeletal muscle. Activation of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) can elicit Nox2 complex formation. The AT1R blocker losartan was used to test the hypothesis that AT1R activation drives Nox2 assembly, nNOS dislocation, FoxO3a activation, and thus alterations in morphology in the unloaded rat soleus. Male Fischer 344 rats were divided into four groups: ambulatory control (CON), ambulatory + losartan (40 mg kg-1 day-1 ) (CONL), 7 days of tail-traction hindlimb unloading (HU), and HU + losartan (HUL). Losartan attenuated unloading-induced loss of muscle fiber cross-sectional area (CSA) and fiber-type shift. Losartan mitigated unloading-induced elevation of ROS levels and upregulation of Nox2. Furthermore, AT1R blockade abrogated nNOS dislocation away from the sarcolemma and elevation of nuclear FoxO3a. We conclude that AT1R blockade attenuates disuse remodeling by inhibiting Nox2, thereby lessening nNOS dislocation and activation of FoxO3a.","Hord, Jeffrey M; Garcia, Marcela M; Farris, Katherine R; Guzzoni, Vinicius; Lee, Yang; Lawler, Matthew S; Lawler, John M",Physiol Rep,,643

Australia has not seen the huge surge of COVID-19 positive cases and subsequent hospitalisations and deaths experienced in other parts of the world. However there have been important social and health strategies to ""flatten"" the curve, to reduce infections and to manage those infected. These have included closure of international and interstate borders, local lockdown measures, physical distancing, shift to work from home, closure of non-essential businesses and full or partial closure of all schools and tertiary education facilities. From the diabetes care perspective, there was a significant and concerted diversion of hospital resources and staff to COVID-19 specific activities. Reduced access to primary care, diagnostic and hospital services for diabetes, combined with fear of exposure to the virus in these settings, led to a significant drop in access to usual diabetes care. Provision of outpatient and private sector diabetes services via telehealth was encouraged and supported by expanded and new government subsidies. Importantly, for the first time, there was government funded subsidy for care delivered via the telephone and inclusion of credentialled diabetes educators in funded telephone/telehealth support. The Australian health professional and consumer organisations worked cooperatively producing guidelines, position statements and other educational resources specific for the COVID-19 setting. Once the COVID-19 pandemic is over, review of all the changes will be important, determining which should be permanently implemented. The learnings from COVID-19 should help prepare Australia for future pandemics or other major health crises.","Andrikopoulos, Sof; Johnson, Greg",Diabetes Res Clin Pract,,643

400729,Cambios a partir de la COVID-19. Una perspectiva desde la pediatría interna hospitalaria./ [Changes from COVID-19. A perspective from internal pediatric medicine],2020,"A patient-reported outcome (PRO) is a measurement of the patient’s condition, reported directly by the patient, without the interpretation by a clinician or anyone else [1] Recently, there has been a growing interest in the integration of PROs as part of data collection about toxicity and symptoms experienced by patients with cancer This integration could have relevant implications not only for a more accurate reporting of adverse events and definition of quality of life (QoL) within clinical trials [2], but also for a better patients’ management in routine clinical practice [3] Many tools and questionnaires have been validated to properly measure QoL and symptoms in patients with lung cancer The inclusion of these measures in clinical trials has several important advantages It allows providing a patient-focused assessment of the burden and the impact of disease Moreover, it allows completely assessing the clinical benefit of a therapy, by complementing the information provided by commonly used efficacy endpoints, including overall survival, and the traditional description of safety based on physicians’ assessment Furthermore, the availability of QoL data from trials could allow a more accurate patient-physician communication about the treatment strategies offered in clinical practice However, a systematic review that we performed in order to evaluate the adoption of QoL among endpoints in randomized phase III trials conducted in lung cancer, published between 2012 and 2018 in 11 major journals, showed quite disappointing findings [4] Beyond the importance in clinical trials, PROs can play an important role in clinical practice Several studies have demonstrated a clear benefit in terms of patients’ QoL [5,6] Our experience, focused on the adoption of PROs in patients receiving active anticancer treatment at Mauriziano Hospital in Turin, showed that the introduction of PROs, thanks to an active role of nurses, was feasible, produced high patients’ satisfaction and a significant QoL improvement compared to the traditional modality of visit [6] In details, we compared 2 groups: patients in the control group underwent “usual” visits, while patients in the “PRO” group received a paper questionnaire by a dedicated nurse before each visit, in order to provide information about symptoms and toxicities After 1 month, mean change from baseline of global QoL was significantly better in the PRO group, and significantly higher proportion of patients obtained a clinically significant improvement in global QoL score In addition to QoL benefit, several studies have shown a significant improvement in overall survival with the adoption of electronic PROs in patients with lung cancer [7-9] In a pivotal randomized trial involving US patients with different solid tumors (including lung cancer) undergoing chemotherapy, patients assigned to the control arm received usual care, while subjects assigned to experimental arm could report their symptoms remotely from home, using tablet computers or computer kiosks [5,7] Doctors received a report of symptoms referred by patients during visits, and nurses received email alerts when patients reported severe or worsening symptoms Beyond the QoL improvement (the primary endpoint of the trial), a significantly longer life expectancy in the experimental arm (median 31 2 months) compared to the usual care arm (26 0 months) was reported [7] A French randomized trial, conducted in lung cancer patients without evidence of disease progression after or during initial treatment, compared a web-mediated follow-up algorithm (experimental arm), based on weekly self-scored patient symptoms, with routine follow-up with CT scans scheduled every 3-6 months according to the disease stage (control arm) [8] In the experimental arm, the oncologist received automatically an alert email when self-scored symptoms matched predefined criteria Notably, a significant improvement in overall survival was found in patients assigned to experimental arm [9] The adoption of electronic PROs in clinical practice could have many advantages [10] Regular discussion of PROs questionnaires, filled out electronically by patients and received by nurses or doctors, could allow a systematic check of the clinical trend of symptoms and side-effects The early, proactive identification of worsening symptoms and toxicities could help prevent the occurrence of severe adverse events needing ER access and hospitalization Adoption and discussion of PROs would reasonably have a positive psychological impact on patients, increasing their satisfaction with healthcare services While the adoption of electronic PROs could initially appear as a challenging organizational effort, we believe that their benefits will definitely be evident in the long-term The use of PROs may allow a significant benefit in terms of patients’ QoL, and this should be more than enough to consider its adoption in clinical practice, which - overall survival benefit or not – is worth the trouble References: 1 Di Maio M, et al Patient-reported outcomes

Although unlikely necessary for all patients, the criteria for utilizing ciNPWT in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA) remain poorly defined. This study's purpose was to compare the incidence of incisional wound complications, non-incisional complications (ie, dressing reactions), reoperations, and periprosthetic joint infections (PJIs) among a group of high-risk primary TKA patients treated with ciNPWT vs an occlusive silver impregnated dressing. METHODS: One hundred thirty high-risk primary TKA patients treated with ciNPWT were 1:1 propensity matched and compared to a historical control group treated with an occlusive silver impregnated dressing. High-risk criteria included the following: active tobacco use, diabetes mellitus, body mass index >35 kg/m2, autoimmune disease, chronic kidney disease, Staphylococcus aureus nasal colonization, and non-aspirin anticoagulation. RESULTS: Age, gender, and risk factor profile were comparable between cohorts. The ciNPWT cohort had significantly fewer incisional wound complications (6.9% vs 16.2%; P = .031) and significantly more non-incisional complications (16.9% vs 1.5%; P < .001). No dressing reactions required clinical intervention. There were no differences in reoperations or periprosthetic joint infections (P = 1.000). In multivariate analysis, occlusive silver impregnated dressings (odds ratio 2.9, 95% confidence interval 1.3-6.8, P = .012) and non-aspirin anticoagulation (odds ratio 2.5, 95% confidence interval 1.1-5.6, P = .028) were associated with the development of incisional wound complications. CONCLUSION: Among high-risk patients undergoing primary TKA, ciNPWT decreased incisional wound complications when compared to occlusive silver impregnated dressings, particularly among those receiving non-aspirin anticoagulation. Although an increase in dressing reactions was observed, the clinical impact was minimal.","Doman, David M; Young, Allison M; Buller, Leonard T; Deckard, Evan R; Meneghini, R Michael",J. arthroplasty,,643

DESIGN: Qualitative analysis of data collected through an anonymous website (www.covidconfidential) provided a repository of uncensored COVID-19 experiences of front-line NHS workers, accessed via a link advertised on the Twitter feed of two high profile medical tweeters and their retweets. SETTING: Community of NHS workers who accessed this social media. PARTICIPANTS: 54 healthcare workers, including doctors, nurses and physiotherapists, accessed the website and left a 'story'. RESULTS: Stories ranged from 1 word to 10 min in length. Thematic analysis identified common themes, with a central aspect being the experience and psychological consequence of trauma. Specific themes were: (1) the shock of the virus, (2) staff sacrifice and dedication, (3) collateral damage ranging from personal health concerns to the long-term impact on, and care of, discharged patients and (4) a hierarchy of power and inequality within the healthcare system. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 confidential gave an outlet for unprompted and uncensored stories of healthcare workers in the context of COVID-19. In addition to personal experiences of trauma, there were perceptions that many operational difficulties stemmed from inequalities of power between management and front-line workers. Learning from these experiences will reduce staff distress and improve patient care in the face of further waves of the pandemic.","Bennett, Paul; Noble, S; Johnston, Stephen; Jones, David; Hunter, Rachael",BMJ Open,,643
402797,Web-based Learning In Periods of Crisis: Reflections on the Impact of COVID-19,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the causative pathogen of pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). So far, no approved therapy has been developed to halt the spread of the pathogen, and unfortunately, the strategies for developing a new therapy will require a long time and very extensive resources. Therefore, drug repurposing has emerged as an ideal strategy toward a smart, versatile, quick way to confine the lethal disease. In this endeavor, natural products have been an untapped source for new drugs. This review represents the confederated experience of multidisciplinary researchers of 99 articles using several databases: Google Scholar, Science Direct, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed. To establish the hypothesis, a Bayesian perspective of a systematic review was used to outline evidence synthesis. Our docking documentation of 69 compounds and future research agenda assumptions were directed toward finding an effective and economic anti-COVID-19 treatment from natural products. Glucosinolate, flavones, and sulfated nitrogenous compounds demonstrate direct anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity through inhibition protease enzymes and may be considered potential candidates against coronavirus. These findings could be a starting point to initiate an integrative study that may encompass interested scientists and research institutes to test the hypothesis in vitro, in vivo, and in clinics after satisfying all ethical requirements.","Nazeam, Jilan; Mohammed, Esraa Z; Raafat, Mariam; Houssein, Mariam; Elkafoury, Asmaa; Hamdy, Dina; Jamil, Lina",SLAS Discov,,643

A key challenge for preventing and controlling COVID-19 is how to quickly, widely, and effectively implement the test for the disease, because testing is the first step to break the chains of transmission. To assist the diagnosis of the disease, radiology imaging is used to complement the screening process and triage patients into different risk levels. Deep learning methods have taken a more active role in automatically detecting COVID-19 disease in chest x-ray images, as witnessed in many recent works. Most of these works first train a CNN on an existing large-scale chest x-ray image dataset and then fine-tune it with a COVID-19 dataset at a much smaller scale. However, direct transfer across datasets from different domains may lead to poor performance due to visual domain shift. Also, the small scale of the COVID-19 dataset on the target domain can make the training fall into the overfitting trap. To solve all these crucial problems and fully exploit the available large-scale chest x-ray image dataset, we formulate the problem of COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification in a semi-supervised open set domain adaptation setting, through which we are motivated to reduce the domain shift and avoid overfitting when training on a very small dataset of COVID-19. In addressing this formulated problem, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Open set Domain Adversarial network (SODA), which is able to align the data distributions across different domains in a general domain space and also in a common subspace of source and target data. In our experiments, SODA achieves a leading classification performance compared with recent state-of-the-art models, as well as effectively separating COVID-19 with common pneumonia.","Zhou, Jieli; Jing, Baoyu; Wang, Zeya",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11003v1.pdf,643

This study included patients with coronavirus disease-2019, who were hospitalized between February 9, 2020, and March 30, 2020. Univariate Cox regression analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO) were used to select variables. Multivariate Cox regression analysis was applied to identify independent risk factors in coronavirus disease-2019. A total of 1135 patients were analyzed during the study period. A total of 35 variables were considered to be risk factors after the univariate regression analysis of the clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters (p < .05), and LASSO regression analysis screened out seven risk factors for further study. The six independent risk factors revealed by multivariate Cox regression were myoglobin (HR, 5.353; 95% CI, 2.633-10.882; p < .001), C-reactive protein (HR, 2.063; 95% CI, 1.036-4.109; p = .039), neutrophil count (HR, 2.015; 95% CI, 1.154-3.518; p = .014), interleukin 6 (Il-6; HR, 9.753; 95% CI, 2.952-32.218; p < .001), age (HR, 2.016; 95% CI, 1.077-3.773; p = .028), and international normalized ratio (HR, 2.595; 95% CI, 1.412-4.769; p = .002). Our results suggested that inflammation-associated factors were significantly associated with in-hospital mortality in coronavirus disease-2019 patients. C-reactive protein, neutrophil count, and interleukin 6 were independent factors for predicting in-hospital mortality and had a better independent predictive ability. We believe these findings may allow early identification of the patients at high risk for death, and can also assist in better management of these patients.","Wang, Jun-Hong; Chen, Ru-Dong; Yang, Hong-Kuan; Zeng, Ling-Cheng; Chen, Hao; Hou, Yu-Yang; Hu, Wei; Yu, Jia-Sheng; Li, Hua",J Med Virol,,643

Lockdown could be a factor in the emergence or deterioration of psychological disorders; it can be even more fragilizing during the specific period of adolescence. The « Maisons des Adolescents ¼ (Teenagers' Houses) had to urgently adjust their practices to provide continuity of care for adolescents suffering from physical or mental disorders. The « Maisons des Adolescents ¼ are pluridisciplinary care centres for adolescents and their families that provide assessments and services for medical, psychological, socio-educational, educational and legal needs. How did care continue for adolescents during lockdown? What adjustments occurred in the « Maisons des Adolescents ¼ during the health crisis? METHODS: This article presents the case of an adolescent who suffered a significant deterioration of her anorexia nervosa during confinement. Through this case, we describe the reorganization of care within the different units (consultations - day hospital - hospitalization unit) of a Parisian « Maison des Adolescents ¼ during the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: In this service, the rapid implementation of the telemedicine system in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic made possible provision of continuity in care for vulnerable adolescents and families. Based on the existing literature, we discuss the advantages and limitations of telemedicine and the practical issues for the future organization of care for adolescents. PERSPECTIVES: In contrast to pediatric medicine or child psychiatry, there is no protocol describing the application of telemedicine in adolescent medicine and psychiatry. There is an urgent need for further evaluation of the use of telemedicine for this population. This kind of research will improve knowledge about the effectiveness, acceptability and limitations of using a teleconsultation device in adolescent psychiatry in a crisis context. Certain remote care modalities implemented during the sanitary crisis could thus be maintained over time and become routine in the field of adolescent medicine and psychiatry.","Carretier, E; Guessoum, S B; Radjack, R; Mao, S-F; Minassian, S; Blanchet, C; Moro, M R; Lachal, J",Neuropsychiatr. enfance adolesc,,643

Temporary changes in re-imbursement, inclusion of home office and patient home environments, and increased access to telehealth technologies by patients, health care staff and health care facilities were key to provide an environment for creative and consistent high-quality stroke care. The continuum of care via telestroke has broadened to include prehospital, inter-facility and intra-facility hospital-based services, stroke telerehabilitation, and ambulatory telestroke. However, disparities in technology access remain a challenge. Preservation of reimbursement and the reduction of regulatory burden that was initiated during the public health emergency will be necessary to maintain expanded patient access to the full complement of telestroke services. Here we outline many of these initiatives and discuss potential opportunities for optimal use of technology in stroke care through and beyond the pandemic.","Guzik, Amy K; Martin-Schild, Sheryl; Tadi, Prasanna; Chapman, Sherita N; Al Kasab, Sami; Martini, Sharyl R; Meyer, Brett C; Demaerschalk, Bart M; Wozniak, Marcella A; Southerland, Andrew M",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,643

We further aimed to investigate the correlation of laboratory data and lymph node stiffness to provide a reference basis for the early diagnosis of NFKD. METHODS: Lymph node stiffness measurements were prospectively performed in 47 patients with NFKD, 56 patients with BCL, and 56 HC using SWE. Cervical SWE was compared in the groups. Factors associated with increased cervical lymph node stiffness were studied. RESULTS: The mean elasticity of the largest cervical lymph nodes was significantly higher in the BCL group than the NFKD and HC groups (mean elasticity ± SD, 16.37 ± 2.45, 12.22 ± 2.64, and 7.81 ± 1.67 kPa, respectively; P < .01), with a cutoff of 14.55 kPa (area under the curve, 0.885; sensitivity, 89%; and specificity, 76%). In patients with NFKD, interleukin 6 (standardized ß = 0.363; P = .01), alanine aminotransferase (standardized ß = 0.253; P = .03), aspartate aminotransaminase (standardized ß = 0.536; P = .047), and total bilirubin (standardized ß = 0.486; P < .01) values were correlated with increased largest cervical lymph node stiffness. CONCLUSIONS: Cervical lymph node stiffness was different between NFKD and BCL.

This study aimed to evaluate changes in physical activity (PA), mental health, sleep, and social media use among adolescent girls during lockdown. METHODS: 281 female pupils (12-14 y) taking part in the ongoing Walking In Schools study on the island of Ireland self-reported PA, mental health, sleep, and social media use before (September-October 2019) and during lockdown (May-June 2020), via questionnaires. These were supplemented with open-ended structured interviews conducted with 16 girls during lockdown. RESULTS: During the period of lockdown and school closures, pupils tried new forms of PA and undertook PA with family, but there was no significant change in self-reported PA. There was a decline in health-related quality of life and motivation for exercise; however, self-efficacy for walking and happiness with appearance increased. There was no change in sleep quality or social media usage. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the many challenges that schools face as they reopen, there is a need to continue to prioritize PA and motivation for exercise to support health and well-being in adolescent girls.","O039,; Kane, S Maria; Lahart, Ian M; Gallagher, Alison M; Carlin, Angela; Faulkner, Maria; Jago, Russell; Murphy, Marie H",J Phys Act Health,,643

METHODS: An online survey was performed of neurosurgeons worldwide, conducted over 3 weeks. Depression in neurosurgeons was assessed by Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20. RESULTS: A total of 375 responses were received from 52 countries. Among all neurosurgeons, 34% felt tense, 32.5% were unhappy, 25% experienced insomnia, almost 20% had headaches, and 5% had suicidal ideation during the pandemic. Of participants, 14% had a score on Self-Reporting Questionnaire-20 consistent with depression. The likelihood of depression was significantly higher among those who did not receive guidance about self-protection from their institutions (odds ratio [OR], 2.47), those who did not feel safe with provided personal protective equipments (OR, 3.13), and those whose families considered their workplace unsafe (OR, 2.29). Depression was less likely in neurosurgeons who had minor concerns, compared with those with significant health concerns for their families (OR, 0.36). In multivariate analysis after controlling for effects of other covariates, odds of depression were significantly higher among neurosurgeons who did not feel safe with the provided personal protective equipment (OR, 2.43) and who were exposed to a COVID-19-positive colleague (OR, 2.54). Participants who had moderate concerns for their families had lesser odds of anxiety/depression than did those with significant concerns (OR, 0.28). CONCLUSIONS: Based on the modifiable risk factors of depression in this study, it is recommended that the safety of neurosurgeons be ensured by providing appropriate safety measures for them to regain their confidence and hence reduce the incidence of depression.","Sharif, Salman; Amin, Faridah; Hafiz, Mehak; Benzel, Edward; Peev, Nikolay; Dahlan, Rully Hanafi; Enchev, Yavor; Pereira, Paulo; Vaishya, Sandeep",World Neurosurg,,643

Blocking this interaction shows promise for blocking or ameliorating the virus' pathological effects on the body. By contrast to work focusing on the coronavirus, which has significant potential diversity through possible accumulation of mutations during transmission, targeting the conserved ACE2 protein expressed on human cells offers an attractive alternative route to developing pharmacological prophylactics against viral invasion. In this study, we screened a virtual database of natural peptides in silico, with ACE2 as the target, and performed structural analyses of the interface region in the SARS-COV-2 RBD/ACE2 complex. These analyses have identified 15 potentially effective compounds. Analyses of ACE2/polypeptide interactions suggest that these peptides can block viral invasion of cells by stably binding in the ACE2 active site pocket. Molecular simulation results for Complestatin and Valinomycin indicate that they may share this mechanism. The discovery of this probable binding mechanism provides a frame of reference for further optimization, and design of high affinity ACE2 inhibitors that could serve as leads for production of drugs with preventive and therapeutic effects against SARS-COV-2.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

RESULTS: The internet was the main source for obtaining COVID-19 information among participants in this study. While 45.8% of the participants believed it was ""very unlikely"" for them to get infected with COVID-19, 76.7% perceived COVID-19 as a severe disease. Similarly, 37.5% believed the chance of being cured if infected with COVID-19 is ""unlikely/very unlikely"". The majority of participants (95.6%) perceived their health to be in ""good"" and ""very good"" status. Overall, 74.2% mentioned that they stopped visiting public places, 49.7% started using gloves, and 70.4% started wearing a mask. Participants who believed they have a low probability of survival if infected with COVID-19 were more likely to wear masks and practice hand washing. CONCLUSIONS: It appears that communities' psychological and behavioral responses were affected by the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in Afghanistan, especially among young internet users. The findings gained from a timely behavioral assessment of the community might be useful to develop interventions and risk communication strategies in epidemics within and beyond COVID-19.","Mousavi, Sayed Hamid; Delshad, Mohammad Hossein; Acuti Martellucci, Cecilia; Bhandari, Divya; Ozaki, Akihiko; Pourhaji, Fatemeh; Pourhaji, Fahimeh; Reza Hosseini, Sayed Mohammad; Roien, Rohullah; Ramozi, Abass Ali; Wafaee, Marzia; Qaderi, Shohra; Delsoz, Mohammad; Sigdel, Shailendra; Kotera, Yasuhiro; Sawano, Toyoaki; Dhama, Kuldeep; Rodríguez-Morales, Alfonso J; Wang, Jiwei; Tanimoto, Tetsuya; Yousofi, Ali Ahmad; Sah, Ranjit",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,643
426318,Potential impact of introducing vaccines against COVID-19 under supply and uptake constraints in France: A modelling study,2021,"This chapter describes methods used to isolate, identify, and partially characterize lactic acid bacteria (LAB) which exhibit inhibitory activity against Listeria monocytogenes from foods. Vegetal (plant based) sources are rich in naturally occurring LAB and therefore provide an easily accessible source of strains with potential antimicrobial activity for use in food-processing applications. From our previous work, the majority of LAB with inhibitory activity against L. monocytogenes were identified as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) Lactococcus lactis. Although these bacteria are most commonly known for their role in industrial dairy fermentations, they are believed to have originally derived from natural plant-based habitats. These isolates with anti-Listeria activity were all found to carry the genes involved in the production of nisin, which is an approved food-grade preservative (E234). These isolates may find various applications for in situ production of nisin allowing control of L. monocytogenes in various fermented and non-fermented foods and other environments.","Ho, Van Thi Thuy; Dong, Anran; Lo, Raquel; Turner, Mark S",Methods Mol Biol,,643

One of the defining features of group testing is whether the tests are adaptive (i.e., a given test can be chosen based on all previous outcomes) or non-adaptive (i.e., all tests must be chosen in advance). In this paper, building on the success of binary splitting techniques in noiseless group testing (Hwang, 1972), we introduce noisy group testing algorithms that apply noisy binary search as a subroutine. We provide three variations of this approach with increasing complexity, culminating in an algorithm that succeeds using a number of tests that matches the best known previously (Scarlett, 2019), while overcoming fundamental practical limitations of the existing approach, and more precisely capturing the dependence of the number of tests on the error probability. We provide numerical experiments demonstrating that adaptive group testing strategies based on noisy binary search can be highly effective in practice, using significantly fewer tests compared to state-of-the-art non-adaptive strategies.","Teo, Bernard; Scarlett, Jonathan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.12193v1.pdf,643

The appearance of the disease in the Republic of Ireland resulted in a broad postponement of scheduled and routine surgical care. The influence of the novel coronavirus, and the associated imposition of public health measures such as school closures and social distancing, on the burden of emergency surgical disease is less clear. AIM: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the number of patients presenting to our institution with emergent surgical illnesses or requiring emergency general surgical procedures. METHODS: All patients attending our service between March 1st 2020 and April 30th 2020 were identified retrospectively by examining electronic handover and electronic discharge summaries, and data were collected relating to demographics, presenting illness, critical care utilisation, length of stay, operative or endoscopic procedure performed, and in-hospital mortality. Similar data were collected March 1st to April 30th 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively to allow direct comparison. RESULTS: 151 patients were admitted during the study period, compared to a total of 788 during the proceeding three years (mean 2.49 admissions per night versus 4.35 per night, 42.8% reduction, p < 0.001). Median age of admitted patients was 51.8 years, compared to 50.3 years formerly (p = 0.35). 53 emergency procedures were performed, compared to a median of 70 over the same period in the previous years (mean 0.87 per day versus 1.16 per day, 25.4% reduction, p = 0.05). CONCLUSION: A significant overall reduction in the number of patients being admitted to our unit and requiring emergency surgical procedures during March and April 2020 was seen, in line with patterns reported internationally.","O039,; Connell, R M; Khan, M A; Amir, M; Bucheeri, M; Khan, W; Khan, I Z; Barry, K M",Surg.

428324,Conjunctivitis and COVID-19: The importance of an early detection./ Conjuntivitis y COVID-19: la importancia de un reconocimiento precoz,2020,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being hailed as the latest example of a General Purpose Technology that could transform productivity and help tackle important societal challenges. This outcome is however not guaranteed: a myopic focus on short-term benefits could lock AI into technologies that turn out to be sub-optimal in the longer-run. Recent controversies about the dominance of deep learning methods and private labs in AI research suggest that the field may be getting narrower, but the evidence base is lacking. We seek to address this gap with an analysis of the thematic diversity of AI research in arXiv, a widely used pre-prints site. Having identified 110,000 AI papers in this corpus, we use hierarchical topic modelling to estimate the thematic composition of AI research, and this composition to calculate various metrics of research diversity. Our analysis suggests that diversity in AI research has stagnated in recent years, and that AI research involving private sector organisations tends to be less diverse than research in academia. This appears to be driven by a small number of prolific and narrowly-focused technology companies. Diversity in academia is bolstered by smaller institutions and research groups that may have less incentives to race and lower levels of collaboration with the private sector. We also find that private sector AI researchers tend to specialise in data and computationally intensive deep learning methods at the expense of research involving other (symbolic and statistical) AI methods, and of research that considers the societal and ethical implications of AI or applies it in domains like health. Our results suggest that there may be a rationale for policy action to prevent a premature narrowing of AI research that could reduce its societal benefits, but we note the incentive, information and scale hurdles standing in the way of such interventions.","Klinger, Joel; Mateos-Garcia, Juan; Stathoulopoulos, Konstantinos",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.10385v2.pdf,643

We focus on the non-energy exchange traded funds (ETFs) as proxies for financial innovations given the potential positive correlation between energy variants and crude oil proxies. We employ a multivariate volatility modeling framework that accounts for important statistical features of the non-energy ETFs and oil price series in the computation of optimal weights and optimal hedging ratios. Results show evidence of hedging effectiveness for the financial innovations against oil market risks, with higher hedging performance observed during the pandemic. Overall, we show that sectoral financial innovations provide resilient investment options. Therefore, we propose that including the ETFs in an investment portfolio containing oil could improve risk-adjusted returns, especially in similar financial crisis as witnessed during the pandemic. In essence, our results are useful for investors in the global oil market seeking to maximize risk-adjusted returns when making investment decisions. Moreover, by exploring the role of structural breaks in the multivariate volatility framework, our attempts at establishing robustness for the results reveal that ignoring the same may lead to wrong conclusions about the hedging effectiveness.","Salisu, Afees A.; Kingsley, Obiora",Financial Innovation,,643

Clinical series describing treatment methods and outcomes for upper abdominal tumors using a 1.5 Tesla MR Linac are lacking. We present the first clinical series of upper abdominal tumors treated using a 1.5 Tesla MR Linac along with the acquisition of intra-treatment quantitative imaging. MATERIALS/METHODS: 10 patients with abdominal tumors were treated at our institution. Each patient enrolled in an IRB approved advanced imaging protocol. Both daily real-time adaptive and non-adaptive methods were used, and selection criteria are described. Adaptive plans were based on pre-beam motion-averaged or mid-position images derived from respiratory-correlated 4D-MRI. Quantitative intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging and T2 mapping were acquired during plan adaptation. Real-time motion monitoring using cine MRI was performed during beam-on. RESULTS: Median patient age was 68.2, five patients were female. Tumor types included liver metastatic lesions from melanoma and sarcoma, primary liver hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and regional abdominal tumors included pancreatic metastatic lesions from renal cell carcinoma (RCC) along with two cases of recurrent pancreatic cancer. Doses included 30 Gy in 6 fractions, 33 Gy in 5 fractions, 50 Gy in 5 fractions, 45 Gy in 3 fractions, and 60 Gy in 3 fractions, depending on the location and clinical circumstances. Treatments were feasible and were successfully completed in all patients without significant acute toxicity, technical complications, or need for back up CT based treatment plans. CONCLUSIONS: We present a first clinical series of patients treated for pancreatic tumors, primary liver tumors, and secondary liver tumors with a 1.5 Tesla MR Linear accelerator using adapt-to-position and adapt-to-shape strategies. Treatments were well tolerated by all patients. Acquisition of fully quantitative MR imaging was feasible during the course of the treatment delivery workflow without extending overall treatment times.","Hal, William A; Straza, Michael W; Chen, Xinfeng; Mickevicius, Nikolai; Erickson, Beth; Schultz, Chris; Awan, Musaddiq; Ahunbay, Ergun; Li, X Allen; Paulson, Eric S",PLoS One,,643

Since the 2000s, however, the academic global health community has been moving toward a focus on health equity and reexamining the dynamics of global health education (GHE) partnerships. Whereas GHE partnerships have largely focused on providing opportunities for learners from HIC institutions, LMIC institutions are now seeking more equitable experiences for their trainees. Additionally, lessons from the COVID-19 pandemic underscore already important lessons about the value of bidirectional educational exchange, as regions gain new insights from one another regarding strategies to impact health outcomes. Interruptions in experiential GHE programs due to COVID-19-related travel restrictions provide an opportunity to reflect on existing GHE systems, to consider the opportunities and dynamics of these partnerships, and to redesign these systems for the equitable benefit of the various partners. In this commentary, the authors offer recommendations for beginning this process of change, with an emphasis on restructuring GHE relationships and addressing supremacist attitudes at both the systemic and individual levels.","Rabin, Tracy L; Mayanja-Kizza, Harriet; Barry, Michele",Acad. med,,643

438169,Model-based evaluation of school- and non-school-related measures to control the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"When private parties perform contracts, the public bears some of the costs. But what happens when society confronts unexpected contractual risks? During the COVID-19 pandemic, completing particular contracts-such as following through with weddings, conferences, and other large gatherings-will greatly increase the risk of rapidly spreading disease. A close reading of past causes illustrates that when social hazards sharply increase after formation, courts have sometimes rejected, reformed, and reinterpreted contracts so that parties who breach to reduce external harms are not left holding the bag. We describe these cases as a sort of contractual anticanon: where social, and not private, ends are the focus of contract judges. This Essay builds on that observation in making two contributions. Theoretically, it characterizes contracts as bargains that always implicitly involve the public. Law has three tools at hand to govern contract's social cost: delineating subject matter about which parties can bargain, interacting with parties as a regulator, and, finally, interpreting and reforming in court. Post hoc consideration of social costs is the least well known, and most unsettled, mode of governing contract externalities. We ground that technique in its history as a specialized application of the law of contract public policy. Practically, this Essay advises parties negotiating whether and how to perform to consider the public's health, since history teaches that, at least some of the time, courts will too.","Hoffman, David A.; Hwang, Cathy",Columbia Law Review,,643

METHODS: The cephalic vein wall changes were evaluated in 39 male adults mongrel dogs, weighing 10-18 kg, randomly distributed in three groups (group 1 = 7 days, group 2 = 14 days and group 3, 21 days). Single punction and injection of 2 mL of 5 % ethanolamine oleate and 7, 14 and 21 days later operative specimen excision were compared to non-injected contralateral control vein. Histological parameters evaluated (hematoxylin-eosin and Masson's trichrome staining methods) were: venous thrombosis and organization, thrombus recanalization, media layer lesion and inflammatory process, outer wall inflammatory process, hemossiderin, sclerosant spillage outside the outer layer and hyaline amorphous material deposition. RESULTS: Venous thrombosis and thrombus organization were seen in all animals. Thrombus recanalization was not shown until 21 days. Media layer lesion occurred without inflammatory process. Outer wall inflammatory process was seen in all three time periods. Hemossiderin phagocytes occurred on 14th and 21st days. Sclerosant spillage outside the outer layer was seen only on the 7th day. Hyaline amorphous material deposition was seen only on the 21st day. CONCLUSIONS: Ethanolamin oleate in contact with the inner vein wall produced venous thrombosis, organized in all cases.

Understanding how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted food security is important to provide support, and identify long-term impacts and needs. ObjectiveOur team- the National Food Access and COVID research Team (NFACT) was formed to assess food security over different U.S. study sites throughout the pandemic, using common instruments and measurements. Here we present results from 18 study sites across 15 states and nationally over the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsA validated survey instrument was developed and implemented in whole or part across the sites throughout the first year of the pandemic, representing 22 separate surveys. Sampling methods for each study site were convenience, representative, or high-risk targeted. Food security was measured using the USDA six-item module. Food security prevalence was analyzed using analysis of variance by sampling method to statistically significant differences. ResultsIn total, more than 27,000 people responded to the surveys. We find higher prevalence of food insecurity (low or very low food security) since the COVID-19 pandemic, as compared to before the pandemic. In nearly all study sites, we find higher prevalence of food insecurity among Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC), households with children, and those with job disruptions. We also demonstrate lingering food insecurity, with high or increased prevalence over time in sites with repeat surveys. We find no statistically significant differences between convenience and representative surveys, but statistically higher prevalence of food insecurity among high-risk compared to convenience surveys. ConclusionsThis comprehensive multi-study site effort demonstrates higher prevalence of food insecurity since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, which in multiple survey sites continues throughout the first year of the pandemic. These impacts were prevalent for certain demographic groups, and most pronounced for surveys targeting high-risk populations.","Niles, Meredith T.; Beavers, Alyssa W.; Clay, Lauren A.; Dougan, Marcelle M.; Pignotti, Giselle A.; Rogus, Stephanie; Savoie-Roskos, Mateja R.; Schattman, Rachel E.; Zack, Rachel M.; Acciai, Francesco; Allegro, Deanne; Belarmino, Emily H.; Bertmann, Farryl; Biehl, Erin; Birk, Nick; Bishop-Royse, Jessica; Bozlak, Christine; Bradley, Brianna; Brenton, Barrett P.; Buszkiewicz, James; Cavaliere, Brittney N.; Cho, Young; Clark, Eric M.; Coakley, Kathryn; Coffin-Schmitt, Jeanne; Collier, Sarah M.; Coombs, Casey; Dressel, Anne; Drewnowski, Adam; Evans, Tom; Feingold, Beth J.; Fiechtner, Lauren; Fiorella, Kathryn J.; Funderburk, Katie; Gadhoke, Preety; Gonzales-Pacheco, Diana; Safi, Amelia Greiner; Gu, Sen; Hanson, Karla L.; Harley, Amy; Harper, Kaitlyn; Hosler, Akiko S.; Ismach, Alan; Josephson, Anna; Laestadius, Linnea; LeBlanc, Heidi; Lewis, Laura R.; Litton, Michelle M.; Martin, Katie S.; Martin, Shadai; Martinelli, Sarah; Mazzeo, John; Merrill, Scott C.; Neff, Roni; Nguyen, Esther; Ohri-Vachaspati, Punam; Orbe, Abigail; Otten, Jennifer J.; Parmer, Sondra; Pemberton, Salome; Qusair, Zain Al Abdeen; Rivkina, Victoria; Robinson, Joelle; Rose, Chelsea M.; Sadeghzadeh, Saloumeh; Sivaramakrishnan, Brinda; Arroyo, Mariana Torres; Voorhees, McKenna; Yerxa, Kathryn",,,643
443921,Guidelines for the Promotion and Appropriation of Open Educational Resources in Educational Institutions of Peru and Latin America in the Context of Covid-19,2020,"Healthcare professionals' capacity to protect themselves, while caring for infected patients during an infectious disease pandemic, depends on their ability to practise universal precautions. In turn, universal precautions rely on the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). During the SARS-CoV2 outbreak many healthcare workers across the globe have been reluctant to provide patient care because crucial PPE components are in short supply. The lack of such equipment during the pandemic was not a result of careful resource allocation decisions in the global north, where the short supply could be explained through their high cost. Instead, they were the result of democratically elected governments prioritising low tax regimes over an adequate resourcing of their healthcare delivery systems. Such decisions were made despite global health experts warning about the high probability of pandemics like SARS-CoV2 occurring during our lifetimes. Avoidable allocation decisions by democratically elected political leaders resulted in a lack of sufficient PPE for healthcare professionals. After discussing and discounting various ethical arguments in support of a professional obligation to treat, even without or with suboptimal PPE, I conclude that these policy decisions were sufficiently grave that they provide a sound ethical rationale to justify healthcare workers' refusal to provide care to infected patients.","Schuklenk, Udo",J Med Ethics,,643

Among Western countries, Italy has been particularly hit at the beginning of the pandemic, immediately after China. In Italy and elsewhere, women seem to be less affected than men by severe/fatal COVID-19 infection, regardless of their age. Although women and men are affected differently by this infection, very few studies consider different therapeutic approaches for the two sexes. Understanding the mechanisms underlying these differences may help to find appropriate and sex specific therapies. Here, we consider that other mechanisms are involved to explain this difference, in addition to the protection attributable to oestrogens. Several X-linked genes (such as ACE2) and Y-linked genes (SRY and SOX9) may explain sex differences. Cardiovascular comorbidities are among the major enhancers of virus lethality. In addition, the number of sex-independent, non-genetic factors that can change susceptibility and mortality is enormous, and many other factors should be considered, including gender and cultural habits in different countries.","Penna, Claudia; Mercurio, Valentina; Tocchetti, Carlo G; Pagliaro, Pasquale",Br. j. pharmacol,,643

This is a cross-sectional study of infants under 90 days of age with FWS and positive SARS-CoV2 PCR in nasopharyngeal swab/aspirate, attended at the emergency departments of 49 Spanish hospitals (EPICO-AEP cohort) from March 1 to June 26, 2020. Three hundred and thirty-three children with COVID-19 were included in EPICO-AEP. A total of 67/336 (20%) were infants less than 90 days old, and 27/67(40%) presented with FWS. Blood cultures were performed in 24/27(89%) and were negative in all but one (4%) who presented a Streptococcus mitis bacteremia. Urine culture was performed in 26/27(97%) children and was negative in all, except in two (7%) patients. Lumbar puncture was performed in 6/27(22%) cases, with no growth of bacteria. Two children had bacterial coinfections: 1 had UTI and bacteremia, and 1 had UTI. C-reactive was protein over 20 mg/L in two children (one with bacterial coinfection), and procalcitonin was normal in all. One child was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit because of apnea episodes. No patients died.Conclusion: FWS was frequent in infants under 90 days of age with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Standardized markers to rule out bacterial infections remain useful in this population, and the outcome is generally good. What is Known: â¢ Fever without source (FWS) in infants is a common cause of consultation at the emergency department, and young infants have a higher risk of serious bacterial infections (SBI). â¢ The emergence of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 could affect the approach to young infants with FWS in the emergency department. management of those children is a challenge because information about bacterial coinfection and prognosis is scarce. What is New: â¢ SARS-CoV-2 infection should be ruled out in young infants (< 90 days of age) with FWS in areas with community transmission. â¢ Bacterial coinfection rarely coexists in those infants. â¢ Inflammatory markers were not increased in children without bacterial coinfection. â¢ Outcome is good in most patients.","Blázquez-Gamero, Daniel; Epalza, Cristina; Cadenas, José Antonio Alonso; Gero, Lourdes Calleja; Calvo, Cristina; Rodríguez-Molino, Paula; Méndez, María; Santos, Maria Del Mar; Fumadó, Victoria; Guzmán, María Fernanda; Soriano-Arandes, Antoni; Jiménez, Ana B; Penin, Maria; Cobo-Vazquez, Elvira; Pareja, Marta; Lobato, Zulema; Serna, Miquel; Delgado, Rafael; Moraleda, Cinta; Tagarro, Alfredo",Eur. j. pediatr,,643

446949,Nicotina e novo coronavírus: organizações assinam nota conjunta,2020,"SETTING: The State of Qatar has had one of the highest COVID-19 infection rates globally and has used state-managed quarantine and isolation centres to limit the spread of infection. Quarantine and isolation have been shown to negatively affect the mental health of individuals. Qatar has a unique population, with around 90% of the population being economic migrants and a majority being blue-collar workers and labourers. OBJECTIVES: This study was carried out to evaluate the psychological impact of institutional isolation and quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Qatar. The study also explored the sociodemographic correlates of this psychological impact. DESIGN, PARTICIPANTS AND INTERVENTION: A cross-sectional study involving 748 consenting individuals in institutional quarantine and isolation in Qatar during the months of June and July 2020 was carried out. Relevant sociodemographic data along with depressive and anxiety symptomatology scores were collected from consenting adults at these facilities. RESULTS: 37.4% (n=270) of respondents reported depressive symptoms and 25.9% (n=189) reported anxiety symptoms. The scores were higher for individuals in isolation facilities and higher for migrants from poor socioeconomic group (p<0.001 for both). Within this group, although worries about infection were widely reported, lack of contact with the family was cited as one of the most important sources of distress. Respondents reported that contact with the family and reliable information were important factors that helped during the duration of isolation and quarantine. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reported significantly elevated scores for depression and anxiety during institutional quarantine, which is in keeping with emerging evidence. However, in contrast to other studies reporting mostly from native populations, this study of a population with an overwhelming majority of immigrants highlights the special mental health needs of this specific group and can inform future healthcare policies.","Reagu, Shuja; Wadoo, Ovais; Latoo, Javed; Nelson, Deborah; Ouanes, Sami; Masoodi, Naseer; Karim, Mustafa Abdul; Iqbal, Yousaf; Al Abdulla, Samya; Al Nuaimi, Saleem Khaldoun; Abdelmajid, Alaaeldin Abdelmajid Basheer; Al Samawi, Musaed Saad; Khoodoruth, Mohamed Adil Shah; Khoodoruth, Widaad Nuzhah Chut-Kai; Al-Maslamani, Muna A Rahman S; Alabdulla, Majid",BMJ Open,,643

There is a crucial demand for rapid techniques such as antigen detection test. Considering the different diagnostic accuracy of tests with other respiratory viruses in adults and children, SARS-CoV-2 antigen test must be evaluated specifically in children. METHODS: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device (Abbott) as a point-of-care test for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 in comparison to RT-qPCR in a pediatric population. RESULTS: Four hundred forty nasopharyngeal swabs were tested. Amongst the 18 positive RT-qPCR samples, 14 were detected by the rapid antigen test, given an overall sensitivity of 77.7%. All the samples detected positive with the antigen rapid test were also positive with RT-qPCR. CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of Panbio COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Device is lower in children than in adults. Nevertheless, considering the good values of specificity, negative and positive predictive values this test could be used as a frontline test to obtain quick results, although the negative values with COVID-19 high clinical suspicion should be confirmed using RT-qPCR.","González-Donapetry, Patricia; García-Clemente, Paloma; Bloise, Iván; García-Sánchez, Consuelo; Sánchez Castellano, Miguel Ángel; Romero, María Pilar; Gutiérrez Arroyo, Almudena; Mingorance, Jesús; de Ceano-Vivas La Calle, María; García-Rodriguez, Julio",Pediatr Infect Dis J,,643

This review will highlight the recent studies focusing on disparities in AMI care and how practice patterns have changed over time, and discuss solutions and future directions to overcome disparities in AMI care. RECENT FINDINGS: AMI continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the USA. Racial and ethnic disparities continue to be present in the care and outcomes associated with AMI. Non-white individuals continue to receive less guideline-concordant care and experience higher rates of adverse outcomes compared with white individuals. Health policy and quality improvement interventions have helped to narrow the gap; however, ongoing efforts are needed to continue to attempt to eliminate this disparity. Racial and ethnic disparities persist in the presentation, management, and outcomes of patients with AMI. Improvements in care have narrowed some of the inequalities. Ongoing research and efforts directed at improving access to care, eliminating bias in healthcare, and focusing on coronary heart disease prevention are needed to eliminate disparities.","Simon, Steven; Ho, P Michael",Curr Cardiol Rep,,643

METHODS: A total of 310 patients were included and stratified into severe and non-severe COVID-19 groups. Cross-sectional CT features across different time periods (T0: pre-discharge, T1: 1-4 weeks after discharge, T2: 5-8 weeks after discharge, T3: 9-12 weeks after discharge, T4: > 12 weeks after discharge) were compared, and the longitudinal variations of CT findings were analyzed and compared in both groups. RESULTS: The cumulative absorption rate of fibrosis-like findings in the severe and non-severe groups at T4 was 24.3% (17/70) and 52.0% (53/102), respectively. In both groups, ground-glass opacity (GGO) with consolidation showed a clear decreasing trend at T1, after which they maintained similar lower levels. The GGO in the severe group showed an increasing trend first at T1 and then decreasing at T4; however, the incidence decreased gradually in the non-severe group. Most fibrosis-like findings showed a tendency to decrease rapidly and then remained stable. Bronchial dilatation in the severe group persisted at an intermediate level. CONCLUSIONS: After discharge, the characteristics and changing trends of pulmonary sequelae caused by COVID-19 were significantly different between the two groups.

Computed tomography (CT) findings, such as a spot sign have been shown to be an independent predictor of poor outcome. We have recently encountered a succession of ICH patients who presented with a peculiar imaging finding, which we term the spot on a string sign. This is a rare imaging finding, and interestingly, all these patients presented to our institution over the last few weeks. METHODS: This was a single high-volume center series of patients who presented to our institution between 1 April and 21 May 2020. All patients underwent initial non-contrast CT brain and subsequent CT angiography (CTA). We also present laboratory and clinical data. Our primary measure was the presence of the spot on a string sign on the CTA. We also report the clinical course of these patients. RESULTS: In this study seven large-volume ICH patients with this imaging sign were identified, with a median age of 48 years (range 30-68 years). All had tested negative for coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19). CONCLUSION: We have described an unusual imaging finding in a cohort of younger patients with large-volume ICH, all of whom presented in a 2-month period to a high-volume neurovascular unit. The cause of these ICH presentations and associated imaging findings are unclear, but we encourage other clinicians to be aware of and vigilant for this rare phenomenon, especially in younger patients with such a bleeding pattern.","Nicholson, Patrick; Gao, Meah; Radovanovic, Ivan; Mendes-Pereira, Vitor; Hodaie, Mojgan; Pikula, Aleksandra; Krings, Timo","Clin. neuroradiol.

From observable data on confirmed, recovered, and deceased cases, a noisy measurement for the contact rate can be constructed. To filter out measurement errors and seasonality, a novel unobserved components (UC) model is set up. It specifies the log contact rate as a latent, fractionally integrated process of unknown integration order. The fractional specification reflects key characteristics of aggregate social behavior such as strong persistence and gradual adjustments to new information. A computationally simple modification of the Kalman filter is introduced and is termed the fractional filter. It allows to estimate UC models with richer long-run dynamics, and provides a closed-form expression for the prediction error of UC models. Based on the latter, a conditional-sum-of-squares (CSS) estimator for the model parameters is set up that is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normally distributed. The resulting contact rate estimates for several countries are well in line with the chronology of the pandemic, and allow to identify different contact regimes generated by policy interventions. As the fractional filter is shown to provide precise contact rate estimates at the end of the sample, it bears great potential for monitoring the pandemic in real time.","Hartl, Tobias",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10067v1.pdf,643

Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to investigate PCT levels in severe COVID-19 patients. We searched Embase, ProQuest, MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and ISI/Web of Science for studies that reported the level of PCT of patient with severe COVID-19. We included all studies regardless of design that reported the level of PCT in patients with severe COVID-19. We excluded articles not regarding COVID-19 or not reporting PCT level, studies not in severe patients, review articles, editorials or letters, expert opinions, comments, and animal studies. Nine studies were included in the analysis. The odds of having more severe COVID-19 disease was higher in subjects with elevated PCT (&#8805;0.05 ng/mL) compared with those having low procalcitonin (<0.05 ng/mL) [n = 6, OR(95% CI) = 2.91(1.14, 7.42), p = 0.025). After estimating the mean and standard deviation values from the sample size, median, and interquartile range, a pooled effect analysis indicated higher serum PCT concentrations in patients with severe versus less severe disease [n = 6, SMD(95% CI) = 0.64(0.02, 1.26), p = 0.042]. The results of this study showed that PCT is increased in patients with severe COVID-19 infection.","Heidari-Beni, Farshad; Vahedian-Azimi, Amir; Shojaei, Sajad; Rahimi-Bashar, Farshid; Shahriary, Alireza; Johnston, Thomas P; Sahebkar, Amirhossein",Adv Exp Med Biol,,643

During the COVID-19 pandemic, misinformation and disinformation have spread widely, threatening to drown out credible sources of information. The outbreak has been accompanied by a massive infodemic making it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it. The aim of this commentary is to analyse the dangerous role of fake news and misinformation while the world is in thrall to COVID-19. It begins with a short discussion on post-truth and emo-truth and describes how emo-truth political manifestations are examples of toxic masculinities' aggression. It will also look at the politicisation of masks and how misinformation can hinder compliance to mask adherence. The refusal to wear a mask also became a widely recognized sign of toxic masculinity in reporting around the world. The second half of the paper deals with the role of false truths in fake treatment and public trust in vaccines against COVID-19. The use of fake products and medicines results in a major risk to the health and safety of patients and need to be taken seriously. Political polarisation and online misinformation are also threatening vaccination programmes worldwide, with public trust best described as fickle, volatile and varying widely between countries. In this concoction of fake news, fake treatments and public distrust it is imperative not to capitalise on fears and politicise an already fraught situation. It is only then that public health officials will successfully convey evidence based information.","Scerri, Mariella; Grech, Victor",Early Hum Dev,,643

The European Society of Thoracic Surgeons (ESTS) sent out a survey to assess what impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the practice of thoracic oncology surgery. METHODS: All ESTS members were invited (13-20 April 2020) to complete an online questionnaire of 26 questions, designed by the ESTS learning affairs committee. RESULTS: The response rate was 23.0% and the completeness rate was 91.2%. The number of treated COVID-positive cases per hospital varied from fewer than 20 cases (30.6%) to more than 200 cases (22.7%) per hospital. Most hospitals (89.1%) postponed surgical procedures. All hospitals performed patient screening with a nasopharyngeal swab, but only 6.7% routinely tested health care workers. A total of 20% of respondents reported that multidisciplinary meetings were completely cancelled and 66%, that multidisciplinary decisions were not different from normal practice. Trends were recognized in prioritizing surgical patients based on age (younger than 70), type of surgery (lobectomy or less), size of tumour (T1-2) and lymph node involvement (N1). Sixty-three percent of respondents reported that surgeons were involved in daily care of COVID-19-positive patients. Fifty-three percent mentioned that full personal protective equipment was available to them when treating a COVID-19-positive patient. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic has created issues for the safety of health care workers, and surgeons have been forced to change their routine practice. However, there was no consensus about surgical priorities in lung cancer patients, demonstrating the need for the production of specific guidelines.","Depypere, Lieven P; Daddi, Niccolò; Gooseman, Michael R; Batirel, Hasan F; Brunelli, Alessandro",Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,,643

However, since such systems are normally installed outdoors and in open areas, they are vulnerable to lightning strikes and may suffer from malfunctions or significant damage to sensitive components, which may result in a major breakdown and loss of revenue due to equipment replacement costs and inefficient operation. Thus, the objective of this paper is to investigate the effect of lightning-induced overvoltage on a hybrid solar PV–battery energy storage system, considering indirect lightning strikes nearby the system. The presented hybrid solar PV–battery energy storage system and lightning-induced overvoltage are modeled in Electro-Magnetic Transient Program-Restructured Version (EMTP-RV) software. The lightning-induced overvoltage is simulated based on a lightning waveshape of 10/350 µs using the Heidler expression, whilst the Rusck model is used to simulate the lightning-induced overvoltage. Different lightning current amplitudes (3, 19, and 169 kA), lightning strike locations (20, 50, and 100 m), and cable lengths (5, 10, and 20 m) are used to investigate the induced effects on the system and on the impulse withstand voltage of 6kV, as stated in MS IEC 60664-1 for solar PV–battery systems and inverters at the DC side. The results indicate that as the lightning strike distance increases from 20 to 100 m, the percentage of strikes exceeding the impulse withstand voltage reduces from 67% to 54% at 19 kA. At 169 kA, the impulse withstand voltage is exceeded by more than 100%, regardless of the strike distance (from 20 to 100 m). Furthermore, differences in cable length do not have much impact on the lightning-induced overvoltage due to the small voltage drop across the short cable length. This study provides useful information for PV systems owners and will be useful in assigning appropriate lightning protection schemes for PV farms.","Ahmad, Nor Izzati Zaipatimah Ali Mohd Zainal Abidin Ab Kadir Osman Miszaina Zaini Nur Hazirah Muhammad Hakirin Roslan",Applied Sciences,,643

This study compared grip strength in paediatric patients with CHD with healthy controls and determined a possible association between grip strength and health-related physical fitness (HRPF). METHODS: Grip strength and HRPF were assessed in 569 children (12.4 years, 95% CI 12.16 to 12.72; 238 girls) with various CHD and compared with 2551 healthy controls (11.4 years, 95% CI 11.3 to 11.5; 1424 girls). Grip strength was determined as the maximum value of three repetitions with each hand. HRPF was tested by five motor tasks (FITNESSGRAM) and converted into an SD score (z-score). RESULTS: After adjusting for age, sex and weight, children with CHD showed significantly lower grip strength compared with healthy controls (CHD: 20.8 kg, 95% CI 20.4 to 21.2; controls: 24.5 kg, 95% CI 24.3 to 24.8). CHD subgroup analysis also revealed significantly lower grip strength than the controls, with the lowest values in patients with total cavopulmonary connection (19.1, 95% CI 18.0 to 20.2). Children with complex CHD showed the lowest values with 19.19.8 kg (95% CI 19.2 to 20.4), those with moderate 20.7 kg (95% CI 19.9 to 21.4) and those with simple 22.5 kg (95% CI 21.6 to 23.3), respectively. HRPF was also lower (z-score: -0.46, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.35) compared with healthy controls and poorly associated with grip strength (r=0.21). CONCLUSIONS: Grip strength is already reduced in children with CHD and poorly associated with HRPF. This suggests that grip strength and HRPF are different domains and have to be assessed separately.","Meyer, Michael; Wang, Yi; Brudy, Leon; Häcker, Anna-Luisa; Schulz, Thorsten; Weberruss, Heidi; Oberhoffer, Renate; Ewert, Peter; Müller, Jan",Arch. dis. child,,643

However, the extent of this effect requires further investigation. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between long-term exposure to air pollution and the case fatality rate (CFR) of patients with COVID-19. The data on air quality index (AQI), PM2.5, PM10, SO2 , NO2 , and O3 from 14 major cities in China in the past 5 years (2015-2020) were collected, and the CRF of COVID-19 patients in these cities was calculated. First, we investigated the correlation between CFR and long-term air quality indicators. Second, we examined the air pollutants affecting CFR and evaluated their predictive values. We found a positive correlation between the CFR and AQI (1, 3, and 5 years), PM2.5 (1, 3, and 5 years), and PM10 (1, 3, and 5 years). Further analysis indicated the more significant correlation for both AQI (3 and 5 years) and PM2.5 (1, 3, and 5 years) with CFR, and moderate predictive values for air pollution indicators such as AQI (1, 3, and 5 years) and PM2.5 (1, 3, and 5 years) for CFR. Our results indicate that long-term exposure to severe air pollution is associated with higher CFR of COVID-19 patients. Air pollutants such as PM2.5 may assist with the prediction of CFR for COVID-19 patients.","Hou, Chang-Kai; Qin, Ya-Fei; Wang, Grace; Liu, Quan-Lei; Yang, Xin-Yu; Wang, Hao",J Med Virol,,643
477407,Recent biotechnological tools for diagnosis of corona virus disease: A review,2020,"Objectives: Following a surge in cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in June 2020, India became the third-worst affected country worldwide. This study aims to analyse the underlying epidemiological situation in India and explain possible impacts of policy and technological changes. Methods: Secondary data were utilized, including recently published literature from government sources, the COVID-19 India website and local media reports. These data were analysed, with a focus on the impact of policy and technological interventions. Results: The spread of COVID-19 in India was initially characterized by fewer cases and lower case fatality rates compared with numbers in many developed countries, primarily due to a stringent lockdown and a demographic dividend. However, economic constraints forced a staggered lockdown exit strategy, resulting in a spike in COVID-19 cases. This factor, coupled with low spending on health as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), created mayhem because of inadequate numbers of hospital beds and ventilators and a lack of medical personnel, especially in the public health sector. Nevertheless, technological advances, supported by a strong research base, helped contain the damage resulting from the pandemic. Conclusions: Following nationwide lockdown, the Indian economy was hit hard by unemployment and a steep decline in growth. The early implementation of lockdown initially decreased the doubling rate of cases and allowed time to upscale critical medical infrastructure. Measures such as asymptomatic testing, public-private partnerships, and technological advances will be essential until a vaccine can be developed and deployed in India. Public interest summary: The spread of COVID-19 in India was initially characterized by lower case numbers and fewer deaths compared with numbers in many developed countries. This was mainly due to a stringent lockdown and demographic factors. However, economic constraints forced a staggered lockdown exit strategy, resulting in a spike in COVID-19 cases in June 2020. Subsequently, India became the third-worst affected country worldwide.

However, this kind of contact interaction can cause severe problems, such as inevitable mechanical wear and cross-infection of bacteria or viruses between the users, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, revolutionary noncontact human-machine interaction (HMI) is highly desired in remote online detection and noncontact control systems. In this study, a flexible high-sensitivity humidity sensor and array are presented, fabricated by anchoring multilayer graphene (MG) into electrospun polyamide (PA) 66. The sensor works in noncontact mode for asthma detection, via monitoring the respiration rate in real time, and remote alarm systems and provides touchless interfaces in medicine delivery for bedridden patients. The physical structure of the large specific surface area and the chemical structure of the abundant water-absorbing functional groups of the PA66 nanofiber networks contribute to the high performance synergistically. This work can lead to a new era of noncontact HMI without the risk of contagiousness and provide a general and effective strategy for the development of smart electronics that require noncontact interaction.","Lu, Lijun; Jiang, Chunpeng; Hu, Guosheng; Liu, Jingquan; Yang, Bin",Adv Mater,,643

Being socially isolated and the experience of loneliness is not only experienced by older adults, but also by younger people who live alone and cannot communicate with others or get involved in social situations as they used to. In the absence of `face-to-face' contact with a human companion, there is a potential for robotic companions to reduce loneliness. Here, we present results from an online study showing that a change caused by COVID-19 has affected people's perception of social robots, as companions, and that the feeling of loneliness can drive the purchase of a social robot.","Ghafurian, Moojan; Ellard, Colin; Dautenhahn, Kerstin",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.05382v1.pdf,643

DESIGN: Observational cohort study. SETTING: A total of 258 adult critical care units. PATIENTS: A total of 10,362 patients with confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 with a start of critical care between March 1, 2020, and June 22, 2020, of whom 9,990 were eligible (excluding patients with a duration of critical care less than 24 hr or missing core variables). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The main outcome measure was time to death within 30 days of the start of critical care. Of 9,990 eligible patients (median age 60 yr, 70% male), 6,027 died within 30 days of the start of critical care. As of July 22, 2020, 189 patients were still receiving critical care and a further 446 were still in acute hospital. Data were missing for between 0.1% and 7.2% of patients across prognostic factors. We imputed missing data ten-fold, using fully conditional specification and continuous variables were modeled using restricted cubic splines. Associations between the candidate prognostic factors and time to death within 30 days of the start of critical care were determined after adjustment for multiple variables with Cox proportional hazards modeling. Significant associations were identified for age, ethnicity, deprivation, body mass index, prior dependency, immunocompromise, lowest systolic blood pressure, highest heart rate, highest respiratory rate, PaO2/FIO2 ratio (and interaction with mechanical ventilation), highest blood lactate concentration, highest serum urea, and lowest platelet count over the first 24 hours of critical care. Nonsignificant associations were found for sex, sedation, highest temperature, and lowest hemoglobin concentration. CONCLUSIONS: We identified patient characteristics that predict an increased likelihood of death within 30 days of the start of critical care for patients with coronavirus disease 2019. These findings may support development of a prediction model for benchmarking critical care providers.","Ferrando-Vivas, Paloma; Doidge, James; Thomas, Karen; Gould, Doug W; Mouncey, Paul; Shankar-Hari, Manu; Young, J Duncan; Rowan, Kathryn M; Harrison, David A",Crit. care med,,643

There has been little research conducted to understand how SARS-CoV-2 has affected health care systems and professionals in terms of their work. Finding effective ways to share the knowledge and insight between countries, including lessons learned, is paramount to the international containment and management of the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this project is to compare the pandemic response to COVID-19 in Brazil, Canada, China, France, Japan, and Mali. This comparison will be used to identify strengths and weaknesses in the response, including challenges for health professionals and health systems. METHODS: We will use a multiple case study approach with multiple levels of nested analysis. We have chosen these countries as they represent different continents and different stages of the pandemic. We will focus on several major hospitals and two public health interventions (contact tracing and testing). It will employ a multidisciplinary research approach that will use qualitative data through observations, document analysis, and interviews, as well as quantitative data based on disease surveillance data and other publicly available data. Given that the methodological approaches of the project will be largely qualitative, the ethical risks are minimal. For the quantitative component, the data being used will be made publicly available.

METHODS: Consecutive cases over 60 years old with COVID-19 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from Jan 1 to Feb 6, 2020 were included. The primary outcomes were death and survival till March 5. Data of demographics, clinical features, comorbidities, laboratory tests and complications were collected and compared for different outcomes. Cox regression was performed for prognostic factors. RESULTS: 339 patients with COVID-19 (aged 71±8 years,173 females (51%)) were enrolled, including 80 (23.6%) critical, 159 severe (46.9%) and 100 moderate (29.5%) cases. Common comorbidities were hypertension (40.8%), diabetes (16.0%) and cardiovascular disease (15.7%). Common symptoms included fever (92.0%), cough (53.0%), dyspnea (40.8%) and fatigue (39.9%). Lymphocytopenia was a common laboratory finding (63.2%). Common complications included bacterial infection (42.8%), liver enzyme abnormalities (28.7%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (21.0%). Till Mar 5, 2020, 91 cases were discharged (26.8%), 183 cases stayed in hospital (54.0%) and 65 cases (19.2%) were dead. Shorter length of stay was found for the dead compared with the survivors (5 (3-8) vs. 28 (26-29), P < 0.001). Symptoms of dyspnea (HR 2.35, Pâ¯=â¯0.001), comorbidities including cardiovascular disease (HR 1.86, Pâ¯=â¯0.031) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (HR 2.24, Pâ¯=â¯0.023), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (HR 29.33, P < 0.001) were strong predictors of death.

In contrast to previous studies that attempt to predict the success of crowdfunded projects based on specific characteristics of the projects and their creators, we present a more general approach that focuses on crowd dynamics and is robust to the particularities of different crowdfunding platforms. We rely on a multi-method analysis to investigate the correlates, predictive importance, and quasi-causal effects of features that describe crowd dynamics in determining the success of crowdfunded projects. By applying a multi-method analysis to a study of fundraising in three different online markets, we uncover general crowd dynamics that ultimately decide which projects will succeed. In all analyses and across the three different platforms, we consistently find that funders' behavioural signals (1) are significantly correlated with fundraising success; (2) approximate fundraising outcomes better than the characteristics of projects and their creators such as credit grade, company valuation, and subject domain; and (3) have significant quasi-causal effects on fundraising outcomes while controlling for potentially confounding project variables. By showing that universal features deduced from crowd behaviour are predictive of fundraising success on different crowdfunding platforms, our work provides design-relevant insights about novel types of collective decision-making online. This research inspires thus potential ways to leverage cues from the crowd and catalyses research into crowd-aware system design.","Dambanemuya, Henry K.; Horv'at, EmHoke-'Agnes",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.06315v1.pdf,643

Previously we showed that seroconversion associates with decreased production of select IFN ligands (Galbraith et al, 2021). We show now that the antiviral transcriptional response in circulating immune cells is strongly associated with a specific subset of ligands, most prominently IFNA2 and IFNG. In contrast, proteomics signatures indicative of endothelial damage associate with levels of IFNB and IFNA6. Differential IFN ligand production is linked to distinct constellations of circulating immune cells. Lastly, IFN ligands associate differentially with activation of the kynurenine pathway, dysregulated fatty acid metabolism, and altered central carbon metabolism.

Physical tethering of these molecular machines during translocation, in conjunction with their internal architectural features, generates DNA topological strain in the form of template supercoiling. It is known that the build-up of transient excessive supercoiling poses severe threats to genome function and stability and that highly specialized enzymes-the topoisomerases (TOP)-have evolved to mitigate these threats. Furthermore, due to their intracellular abundance and fast supercoil relaxation rates, it is generally assumed that these enzymes are sufficient in coping with genome-wide bursts of excessive supercoiling. However, the recent discoveries of chromatin architectural factors that play important accessory functions have cast reasonable doubts on this concept. Here, we reviewed the background of these new findings and described emerging models of how these accessory factors contribute to supercoil homeostasis. We focused on DNA replication and the generation of positive (+) supercoiling in front of replisomes, where two accessory factors-GapR and HMGA2-from pro- and eukaryotic cells, respectively, appear to play important roles as sinks for excessive (+) supercoiling by employing a combination of supercoil constrainment and activation of topoisomerases. Looking forward, we expect that additional factors will be identified in the future as part of an expanding cellular repertoire to cope with bursts of topological strain. Furthermore, identifying antagonists that target these accessory factors and work synergistically with clinically relevant topoisomerase inhibitors could become an interesting novel strategy, leading to improved treatment outcomes.","Ahmed, Syed Moiz; Dröge, Peter",,,643

Methods: The study sample was a group of 199 consecutive patients over 60 (average age 71.41 ± 6.99; 40.2% women) with AF who were hospitalized in order to perform electrical cardioversion. The Tilburg Frailty Indicator (TFI) was used to assess frailty before cardioversion. The six-month visit after the electrical cardioversion was a follow-up. The follow-up period for the maintenance of sinus rhythm after electrical cardioversion was 180 ± 14 days. Results: Patients in whom cardioversion was effective had a statistically significantly lower severity of frailty syndrome (3.44 ± 1.83 vs 5.87 ± 1.12; p=0.000) and its components: physical components (2.14 ± 1.33 vs 3.62 ± 1.05 p=0.000); emotional components (0.92 ± 0.79 vs 1.29 ± 0.86 p=0.037) and social components (0.37 ± 0.56 vs 0.96 ± 0.46; p=0.000) compared to those patients in which cardioversion was ineffective. In the logistic regression, frailty (OR: 0.65, 95% CI:0.5010-0.8330; p=0.000) was observed to be an independent predictor for maintaining sinus rhythm. Conclusion: Frailty is a novel, independent factor that can be used to predict the effectiveness of electrical cardioversion and the maintenance of sinus rhythm in the elderly population. Modifying the level of recognition in the Tilburg Frailty Indicator to a 4 improved the prediction of the effectiveness of electrical cardioversion as well as the maintenance of sinus rhythm.","Mlynarska, Agnieszka; Mlynarski, Rafal; Marcisz, Czeslaw; Golba, Krzysztof S",Clin Interv Aging,,643

Luckily, some higher education institutions were better equipped to switch over to online teaching, either using a Learning Management System (LMS) or use some other online tools to connect with their students. With the help of surveys of students and teachers from several countries, this article aims to analyze the damage caused to the education sector by the pandemic at the global level. Guided by our literature review, and analysis of responses to our two surveys, we also provide a framework for a national education system, which could withstand future global crises like the one created by the COVID-19, and ensure continuity of education to all, especially the poor sections of the society.","Bajaba, Saleh; Mandurah, Khider; Yamin, Mohammad",Int J Inf Technol,,643
517088,La COVID-19 a fait des sciences médicales un espace de croyance !,2021,"The fashion industry is looking forward to use artificial intelligence technologies to enhance their processes, services, and applications. Although the amount of fashion data currently in use is increasing, there is a large gap in data exchange between the fashion industry and the related AI companies, not to mention the different structure used for each fashion dataset. As a result, AI companies are relying on manually annotated fashion data to build different applications. Furthermore, as of this writing, the terminology, vocabulary and methods of data representation used to denote fashion items are still ambiguous and confusing. Hence, it is clear that the fashion industry and AI companies will benefit from a protocol that allows them to exchange and organise fashion information in a unified way. To achieve this goal we aim (1) to define a protocol called DDOIF that will allow interoperability of fashion data; (2) for DDOIF to contain diverse entities including extensive information on clothing and accessories attributes in the form of text and various media formats; and (3)To design and implement an API that includes, among other things, functions for importing and exporting a file built according to the DDOIF protocol that stores all information about a single item of clothing. To this end, we identified over 1000 class and subclass names used to name fashion items and use them to build the DDOIF dictionary. We make DDOIF publicly available to all interested users and developers and look forward to engaging more collaborators to improve and enrich it.","Al-Rawi, Mohammed; Beel, Joeran",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.03005v1.pdf,643

In the Balearic Islands, access by air and sea was limited and, in addition, health controls were established at the entry points of the islands aimed to detect people with COVID-19. The health check is understood as a Public Health surveillance procedure through which all persons authorised to travel at that time were tested. This procedure, together with the security measures to prevent the spread of the virus, had never before been implemented in the Balearic Islands and required the collaboration of various organizations in order to organise and execute it. This paper shares the experience and analysis of the health control measures implemented in these circumstances. To do so, it describes the procedure carried out, the devices that were developed, the main results and the assessment of the project as a whole. Finally, the positive aspects and possible improvements are considered. The most of people screened upon arrival in Balearics Islands did not register or show clinical symptoms of COVID-19.","Suasi Amengual, M. J.; Muntaner Fernandez, R.; Pol Quetglas, M.

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic on 13 March 2020 and its rapid onset, spatial extent and complex consequences make it a once-in-a-century global disaster. Most countries responded by social distancing measures and severely diminished economic and other activities. Consequently, by the end of April 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has led to numerous environmental impacts, both positive such as enhanced air and water quality in urban areas, and negative, such as shoreline pollution due to the disposal of sanitary consumables. This study presents an early overview of the observed and potential impacts of the COVID-19 on the environment. We argue that the effects of COVID-19 are determined mainly by anthropogenic factors which are becoming obvious as human activity diminishes across the planet, and the impacts on cities and public health will be continued in the coming years.","Cheval, Sorin; Mihai Adamescu, Cristian; Georgiadis, Teodoro; Herrnegger, Mathew; Piticar, Adrian; Legates, David R",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,643

This study investigates the effects of temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed and the specific government policy intervention of partial lockdown on the new cases of COVID-19 infection in Ghana. Daily data on confirmed cases of COVID-19 from March 13, 2020 to April 21, 2020 were obtained from the official website of Our World in Data (OWID) dedicated to COVID-19 while satellite climate data for the same period was obtained from the official website of NASA's Prediction of Worldwide Energy Resources (POWER) project. Considering the nature of the data and the objectives of the study, a time series generalized linear model which allows for regressing on past observations of the response variable and covariates was used for model fitting. The results indicate significant effects of maximum temperature, relative humidity and precipitation in predicting new cases of the disease. Also, results of the intervention analysis indicate that the null hypothesis of no significant effect of the specific policy intervention of partial lockdown should be rejected (p-value=0.0164) at a 5\% level of significance. These findings provide useful insights for policymakers and the public.","Iddrisu, Wahab Abdul; Appiahene, Peter; Kessie, Justice A.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00106v1.pdf,643

590492,Análisis de letalidad en pacientes con demencia neurodegenerativa por COVID-19,2020-07-28,"In this paper, a model is proposed of the pathophysiological processes of COVID-19 starting from the infection of human type II alveolar epithelial cells (pneumocytes) by SARS-CoV-2 and culminating in the development of ARDS. The innate immune response to infection of type II alveolar epithelial cells leads both to their death by apoptosis and pyroptosis and to alveolar macrophage activation. Activated macrophages secrete proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines and tend to polarise into the inflammatory M1 phenotype. These changes are associated with activation of vascular endothelial cells and thence the recruitment of highly toxic neutrophils and inflammatory activated platelets into the alveolar space. Activated vascular endothelial cells become a source of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species (ROS) and contribute to the development of coagulopathy, systemic sepsis, a cytokine storm and ARDS. Pulmonary activated platelets are also an important source of proinflammatory cytokines and ROS, as well as exacerbating pulmonary neutrophil-mediated inflammatory responses and contributing to systemic sepsis by binding to neutrophils to form platelet-neutrophil complexes (PNCs). PNC formation increases neutrophil recruitment, activation priming and extraversion of these immune cells into inflamed pulmonary tissue, thereby contributing to ARDS. Sequestered PNCs cause the development of a procoagulant and proinflammatory environment. The contribution to ARDS of increased extracellular histone levels, circulating mitochondrial DNA, the chromatin protein HMGB1, decreased neutrophil apoptosis, impaired macrophage efferocytosis, the cytokine storm, the toll-like receptor radical cycle, pyroptosis, necroinflammation, lymphopenia and a high Th17 to regulatory T lymphocyte ratio are detailed.","Morris, Gerwyn; Bortolasci, Chiara C.; Puri, Basant K.; Olive, Lisa; Marx, Wolfgang; O'Neil, Adrienne; Athan, Eugene; Carvalho, Andre; Maes, Michael; Walder, Ken; Berk, Michael",Life Sci,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0024320520309188; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.lfs.2020.118166; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024320520309188?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32739471/,643

593263,Mareo al volar irresoluble asociado a la infección por COVID-19: caso clínico,2020-11-25,"BACKGROUND: : SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy is associated with significant maternal morbidity and increased rates of preterm birth. For this reason, COVID-19 vaccine administration in pregnancy has been endorsed by multiple professional societies including ACOG and SMFM despite exclusion of pregnant women from initial clinical trials of vaccine safety and efficacy. However, to date little data exists regarding outcomes after COVID-19 vaccination of pregnant patients. STUDY DESIGN: : A comprehensive vaccine registry was combined with a delivery database for an integrated healthcare system to create a delivery cohort including vaccinated patients. Maternal sociodemographic data were examined to identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccination. Pregnancy and birth outcomes were analyzed, including a composite measure of maternal and neonatal pregnancy complications, the Adverse Outcome Index. RESULTS: : Of 2002 patients in the delivery cohort, 140 (7.0%) received a COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy and 212 (10.6%) experienced a COVID-19 infection during pregnancy. The median gestational age at first vaccination was 32 weeks (range 13 6/7-40 4/7), and patients vaccinated during pregnancy were less likely than unvaccinated patients to experience COVID-19 infection prior to delivery (1.4% (2/140) vs. 11.3% (210/1862), P<0.001). No maternal COVID-19 infections occurred after vaccination during pregnancy. Factors significantly associated with increased likelihood of vaccination in a multivariable logistic regression model included older age, higher level of maternal education, being a non-smoker, use of infertility treatment for the current pregnancy, and lower gravidity. No significant difference in the composite adverse outcome (5.0% (7/140) vs. 4.9% (91/1862), P=0.95) or other maternal or neonatal complications, including thromboembolic events and preterm birth, was observed in vaccinated compared to unvaccinated patients. CONCLUSIONS: : Vaccinated pregnant women in this birth cohort were less likely to experience COVID-19 infection compared to unvaccinated pregnant patients, and COVID-19 vaccination during pregnancy was not associated with increased pregnancy or delivery complications. The cohort was skewed toward late pregnancy vaccination, and thus findings may not be generalizable to vaccination during early pregnancy.","Theiler, Regan N.; Wick, Myra; Mehta, Ramila; Weaver, Amy L.; Virk, Abinash; Swift, Melanie",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589933321001622; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2021.100467; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34425297/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589933321001622?v=s5,643

595988,Cardiovascular Manifestations of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Substance use disorder (SUD) is a leading contributor to the global burden of disease. In Indonesia, the availability of formal treatment for SUD falls short of the targeted coverage. A standardised therapeutic option for SUD with potential for widespread implementation is required, yet evidence-based data in the country are scarce. In this study, we developed a cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)-based group telemedicine model and will investigate effectiveness and implementability in a multicentre randomised controlled trial. METHODS: A total of 220 participants will be recruited from the social networks of eight sites in Indonesia: three hospitals, two primary healthcare centres and three rehabilitation centres. The intervention arm will participate in a relapse prevention programme called the Indonesia Drug Addiction Relapse Prevention Programme (Indo-DARPP), a newly developed 12-week module based on CBT and motivational interviewing constructed in the Indonesian context. The programme will be delivered by a healthcare provider and a peer counsellor in a group therapy setting via video-conferencing, as a supplement to participants’ usual treatments. The control arm will continue treatment as usual. The primary outcome will be the percentage increase in days of abstinence from the primarily used substance in the past 28 days. Secondary outcomes will include addiction severity, quality of life, motivation to change, psychiatric symptoms, cognitive function, coping, and internalised stigma. Assessments will be performed at baseline (week 0), post-treatment (week 13), and 3 and 12 months post-treatment completion (weeks 24 and 60). Retention, participant satisfaction, and cost-effectiveness will be assessed as the implementation outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committees of Universitas Indonesia and Kyoto University. The results will be disseminated via academic journals and international conferences. Depending on trial outcomes, the treatment programme will be advocated for adoption as a formal healthcare-based approach for SUD.

Currently there is a global shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE), especially N95 masks. In order to safeguard healthcare personnel in this critical time and to mitigate shortages of N95 respirators, reuse of N95 respirators has to be considered. METHODS: Using PubMed and Science Direct, a literature search was conducted to find and synthesize relevant literature on decontamination of N95 respirators for their subsequent reuse. Peer-reviewed publications related to methods of decontamination from January 2007 to April 2020 in the English language are included in this narrative review. Bibliographies of articles for relevant literature were also scrutinized. Findings. A total of 19 studies are included in this narrative review. The appraised methods include ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), moist heat incubation (MHI), ethylene oxide (EtO), hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV), microwave steam bags (MSB), microwave-generated steam (MGS), dry microwave oven irradiation, hydrogen peroxide gas plasma (HPGP), dry heat, liquid hydrogen peroxide, and bleach and alcohol. CONCLUSION: In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, reuse of N95 respirators, although suboptimal, can be considered. Evidence reveals that UVGI, MHI, and HPV are amongst the safest and efficacious methods for decontamination of N95 masks. More research is needed to establish the safety and effectiveness of MGS, MSB, dry heat, EtO, liquid hydrogen peroxide, and HPGP. Alcohol, microwave irradiation, and bleach are not recommended because they damage N95 respirators.","Khan, M. A.; Ikram, A.; Savul, S.; Lalani, F. K.; Khan, M.

METHODS: Our prospective, monocentric study enrolled all STEMI patients who underwent PPCI during the COVID‐19 outbreak (n = 83). This cohort was first compared with a previous cohort of STEMI patients (2008–2017, n = 1,552 patients) and was then dichotomized into a non‐COVID‐19 group (n = 72) and COVID‐19 group (n = 11). RESULTS: In comparison with the pre‐outbreak period, patients during the outbreak period were older (59.6 ± 12.9 vs. 62.6 ± 12.2, p = .03) with a delayed seek to care (mean delay first symptoms‐balloon 3.8 ± 3 vs. .7.4 ± 7.7, p < .001) resulting in a two‐fold higher in‐hospital mortality (non COVID‐19 4.3% vs. COVID‐19 8.4%, p = .07). Among the 83 STEMI patients admitted during the outbreak period, 11 patients were infected by COVID‐19. Higher biological markers of inflammation (C‐reactive protein: 28 ± 39 vs. 98 ± 97 mg/L, p = .04), of fibrinolysis (D‐dimer: 804 ± 1,500 vs. 3,128 ± 2,458 μg/L, p = .02), and antiphospholipid antibodies in four cases were observed in the COVID‐19 group. In this group, angiographic data also differed: a thrombotic myocardial infarction nonatherosclerotic coronary occlusion (MINOCA) was observed in 11 cases (1.4% vs. 54.5%, p < .001) and associated with higher post‐procedure distal embolization (30.6% vs. 72.7%, p = .007). The in hospital mortality was significantly higher in the COVID‐19 group (5.6% vs. 27.3%, p = .016). CONCLUSION: The COVID‐19 outbreak implies deep changes in the etiopathogenesis and therapeutic management of STEMI patients with COVID‐19.

METHODS: We used data from the UK Biobank. Multivariable‐adjusted logistic regression was employed in the following analyses: analysis A, to test for association between gout and/or RA and COVID‐19 diagnosis (n = 473,139); analysis B, to test for association between gout and/or RA and death from COVID‐19 in a case‐control cohort of people who died of or survived COVID‐19 (n = 2059); analysis C, to test for association between gout and/or RA and death from COVID‐19 in the entire UK Biobank cohort (n = 473,139). RESULTS: RA, but not gout, was associated with COVID‐19 diagnosis in analysis A. Neither RA nor gout was associated with risk of death in the group diagnosed with COVID‐19 in analysis B. However, RA was associated with risk of death related to COVID‐19 by using the UK Biobank cohort in analysis C, independent of comorbidities and other measured risk factors (odds ratio [OR] 1.9; 95% confidence interval CI 1.2–3.0). Gout was not associated with death related to COVID‐19 in the same UK Biobank analysis (OR 1.2; 95% CI 0.8–1.7).

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of epidemiological factors and lipid biomarkers that may be associated with type II diabetes, hypertension and retinal manifestations in tribal and non-tribal members in the study areas (n = 146 participants). We performed multivariate analyses to determine which, if any, risk factors were unique at the tribal level. Fundus photos and epidemiological data through standardized questionnaires were collected. Blood samples were collected to analyze lipid biomarkers. Univariate analyses were conducted and statistically significant factors at p < 0.10 were entered into a multivariate regression. Results: Of 51 participants for whom phenotyping was available, from the Four Corners region, 31 had type II diabetes (DM), 26 had hypertension and 6 had diabetic retinopathy (DR). Of the 64 participants from Ibupah with phenotyping available, 20 had diabetes, 19 had hypertension and 6 had DR. Navajo participants were less likely to have any type of retinopathy as compared to Goshute participants (odds ratio (OR) = 0.059; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.016–0.223; p < 0.001). Associations were found between diabetes and hypertension in both populations. Older age was associated with hypertension in the Four Corners, and the Navajo that reside there on the reservation, but not within the Goshute and Ibupah populations. Combining both the Ibupah, Utah and Four Corners study populations, being American Indian (p = 0.022), residing in the Four Corners (p = 0.027) and having hypertension (p < 0.001) increased the risk of DM. DM (p < 0.001) and age (p = 0.002) were significantly associated with hypertension in both populations examined. When retinopathy was evaluated for both populations combined, hypertension (p = 0.037) and living in Ibupah (p < 0.001) were associated with greater risk of retinopathy. When combining both American Indian populations from the Four Corners and Ibupah, those with hypertension were more likely to have DM (p < 0.001). No lipid biomarkers were found to be significantly associated with any disease state. Conclusions: We found different comorbid factors with retinal disease outcome between the two tribes that reside within the Intermountain West. This is indicated by the association of tribe and with the type of retinopathy outcome when we combined the populations of American Indians.

The common format of delivering in-person psychotherapy is replaced by psychotherapy via the Internet to a great extent. This study examined how well Austrian psychotherapists feel informed about the use of the Internet in psychotherapy, where additional information needs exist, and which software is used. A link to an online survey was sent to all psychotherapists providing a valid email address in the official list of licensed psychotherapists at the start of the COVID-19 lockdown in Austria. A total of 1547 people took part in the survey. The results show that psychotherapy via the Internet was primarily offered via Skype and Zoom during the COVID-19 pandemic and that the majority of the therapists felt well-informed about psychotherapy via the Internet; however, several therapists stated that they wish to have further information on data protection and security. Overall, the study shows that Austrian psychotherapists coped well with the rapid change from the provision of psychotherapy through personal contact to psychotherapy via the Internet. Security and data protection aspects of therapy via the Internet should be addressed in training and further education of psychotherapists.

Until 15 May 2014, it has infected at least 572 people with a fatality rate of about 30% globally. Studies to understand the virus and to develop antiviral drugs or therapy are necessary and urgent. In the present study, MERS-CoV papain-like protease (PL(pro)) is expressed, and its structural and functional consequences are elucidated. RESULTS: Circular dichroism and Tyr/Trp fluorescence analyses indicated that the secondary and tertiary structure of MERS-CoV PL(pro) is well organized and folded. Analytical ultracentrifugation analyses demonstrated that MERS-CoV PL(pro) is a monomer in solution. The steady-state kinetic and deubiquitination activity assays indicated that MERS-CoV PL(pro) exhibits potent deubiquitination activity but lower proteolytic activity, compared with SARS-CoV PL(pro). A natural mutation, Leu105, is the major reason for this difference. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, MERS-CoV PL(pro) bound by an endogenous metal ion shows a folded structure and potent proteolytic and deubiquitination activity. These findings provide important insights into the structural and functional properties of coronaviral PL(pro) family, which is applicable to develop strategies inhibiting PL(pro) against highly pathogenic coronaviruses.","Lin, Min-Han; Chuang, Shang-Ju; Chen, Chiao-Che; Cheng, Shu-Chun; Cheng, Kai-Wen; Lin, Chao-Hsiung; Sun, Chiao-Yin; Chou, Chi-Yuan",J Biomed Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24898546/; https://doi.org/10.1186/1423-0127-21-54,643

They are associated with otitis media, sinusitis and pneumonia. Annually, the economic impact of HRV infections costs billions in healthcare and lost productivity. Since 1987, 100 officially recognised HRV serotypes reside in two genetically distinct species; HRV A and HRV B, within the genus Enterovirus, family Picornaviridae. Sequencing of their ∼7kb genomes was finalised in 2009. Since 1999, many globally circulating, molecularly‐defined ‘strains’, perhaps equivalent to novel serotypes, have been discovered but remain uncharacterised. Many of these currently unculturable strains have been assigned to a proposed new species, HRV C although confusion exists over the membership of the species. There has not been sufficient sampling to ensure the identification of all strains and no consensus criteria exist to define whether clinical HRV detections are best described as a distinct strain or a closely related variant of a previously identified strain (or serotype). We cannot yet robustly identify patterns in the circulation of newly identified HRVs (niHRVs) or the full range of associated illnesses and more data are required. Many questions arise from this new found diversity: what drives the development of so many distinct viruses compared to other species of RNA viruses? What role does recombination play in generating this diversity? Are there species‐ or strain‐specific circulation patterns and clinical outcomes? Are divergent strains sensitive to existing capsid‐binding antivirals? This update reviews the findings that trigger these and other questions arising during the current cycle of intense rhinovirus discovery.

DESIGN: Retrospective, multisite, observational study of home oximetry monitoring for patients with suspected or proven COVID-19. SETTING: This study analysed patient data from four COVID-19 home oximetry pilot sites in England across primary and secondary care settings. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1338 participants were enrolled in a home oximetry programme across four pilot sites. Participants were excluded if primary care data and oxygen saturations at rest at enrolment were not available. Data from 908 participants were included in the analysis. INTERVENTIONS: Home oximetry monitoring was provided to participants with a known or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19. Participants were enrolled following attendance to emergency departments, hospital admission or referral through primary care services. RESULTS: Of 908 patients enrolled into four different COVID-19 home oximetry programmes in England, 771 (84.9%) had oxygen saturations at rest of 95% or more, and 320 (35.2%) were under 65 years of age and without comorbidities. 52 (5.7%) presented to hospital and 28 (3.1%) died following enrolment, of which 14 (50%) had COVID-19 as a named cause of death. All-cause mortality was significantly higher in patients enrolled after admission to hospital (OR 8.70 (2.53–29.89)), compared with those enrolled in primary care. Patients enrolled after hospital discharge (OR 0.31 (0.15–0.68)) or emergency department presentation (OR 0.42 (0.20–0.89)) were significantly less likely to present to hospital than those enrolled in primary care. CONCLUSIONS: This study finds that home oximetry monitoring can be a safe pathway for patients with COVID-19; and indicates increases in risk to vulnerable groups and patients with oxygen saturations <95% at enrolment, and in those enrolled on discharge from hospital. Findings from this evaluation have contributed to the national implementation of home oximetry across England.","Clarke, Jonathan; Flott, Kelsey; Fernandez Crespo, Roberto; Ashrafian, Hutan; Fontana, Gianluca; Benger, Jonathan; Darzi, Ara; Elkin, Sarah",BMJ Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34521666/; https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2021-049235,643
618456,Pacientes con carcinoma broncogénico en lista de espera en plena crisis del COVID-19: ¿Y ahora qué hacemos?,2020-05-13,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Now that vaccines have been developed and are being deployed to address the COVID-19 pandemic, a major concern is the emergence of mutations in severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that confer immune escape or enhanced fitness. As such, it is important to assess how rapidly the virus is mutating to gauge the likelihood of such an event. Using ≈290,000 SARS-CoV-2 proteome sequences deposited in a resource known as the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), we show that 27 of the proteins comprising the SARS-CoV-2 virus are mutating at different rates, with most exhibiting little to no mutational variability. Specifically, we observe that the principal targets of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics, the Spike and Nucleocapsid proteins, have the highest mutational variability. Additionally, we provide the foremost assessment of SARS-CoV-2 mutations in terms of time, geography, and their location in the available 3D protein structure. Together, these data demonstrate that the SARS-CoV-2 proteome is slowly accumulating mutations. These finding suggest that extant vaccines and therapies will likely remain effective for the foreseeable future, but the continued surveillance for mutations in primary viral targets is warranted. ABSTRACT: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a worldwide crisis with profound effects on both public health and the economy. In order to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, research groups have shared viral genome sequence data through the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID). Over the past year, ≈290,000 full SARS-CoV-2 proteome sequences have been deposited in the GISAID. Here, we used these sequences to assess the rate of nonsynonymous mutants over the entire viral proteome. Our analysis shows that SARS-CoV-2 proteins are mutating at substantially different rates, with most of the viral proteins exhibiting little mutational variability. As anticipated, our calculations capture previously reported mutations that arose in the first months of the pandemic, such as D614G (Spike), P323L (NSP12), and R203K/G204R (Nucleocapsid), but they also identify more recent mutations, such as A222V and L18F (Spike) and A220V (Nucleocapsid), among others. Our comprehensive temporal and geographical analyses show two distinct periods with different proteome mutation rates: December 2019 to July 2020 and August to December 2020. Notably, some mutation rates differ by geography, primarily during the latter half of 2020 in Europe. Furthermore, our structure-based molecular analysis provides an exhaustive assessment of SARS-CoV-2 mutation rates in the context of the current set of 3D structures available for SARS-CoV-2 proteins. This emerging sequence-to-structure insight is beginning to illuminate the site-specific mutational (in)tolerance of SARS-CoV-2 proteins as the virus continues to spread around the globe.","Vilar, Santiago; Isom, Daniel G.",Biology (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/biology10020091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33530355/,643

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 658 individuals were recruited from multiple breast cancer centers in Hubei Province. Online questionnaires were conducted, and included demographic information, clinical features, and four Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) scales (GAP-7, PHQ-9, ISI, and IES-R). Multivariable logistic regression analysis was designed to identify potential factors on mental health outcomes. RESULTS: Questionnaires were collected from February 16 to 19, 2020, the peak time point of COVID-19 outbreak in China. 46.2% BC patients had to modify planned necessary anti-cancer treatment during the outbreak. 8.9% and 9.3% patients reported severe anxiety and severe depression, respectively. 20.8% and 4.0% patients showed severe distress and insomnia, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated poor general condition, shorter duration after BC diagnosis, aggressive BC molecular subtypes and close contact with COVID-19 patients as independent factors associated with anxiety. Poor general condition and CVC (central venous catheter) flushing delay were independently association factors depression. In terms of insomnia, poor generation condition was the only associated independent factor. Poor physical condition and treatment discontinuation were underlying risk factors for distress based on multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: High rates of anxiety, depression, distress, and insomnia were observed in patients with breast cancer during the COVID-19 outbreak. Special attention should be paid to psychological status of breast cancer patients especially those with poor general condition, treatment discontinuation, aggressive molecular subtypes and metastatic breast cancer.","Juanjuan, Li; Santa-Maria, Cesar Augusto; Hongfang, Feng; Lingcheng, Wang; Pengcheng, Zhang; Yuangbing, Xu; Yuyan, Tan; Zhongchun, Liu; Bo, Du; Meng, Lan; Qingfeng, Yang; Feng, Yao; Yi, Tu; Shengrong, Sun; Xingrui, Li; Chuang, Chen",Clin Breast Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32709505/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1526820920301476?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1526820920301476; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clbc.2020.06.003,643

METHODS: All patients attending Tanta University hospital for receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF injections were screened. Patients who were previously deferred according to a modified protocol implemented in the hospital in response to the pandemic or who demonstrated deviation from it were included for further analysis. RESULTS: During the audit period, 83 patients attending for anti-VEGF injections were screened, of whom 40 met the abovementioned criteria and were included for analysis. In the deferred subgroup (11 eyes), predeferral mean values of logMAR best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal subfield thickness (CST) were 1 ± 0.23 and 444.57 ± 200.1 µm, respectively. There was no significant change when the patients returned for their deferred injections, with the mean BCVA and CST values being 0.8 ± 0.22 and 413.71 ± 237.7 µm, respectively (p = 0.27 and p = 0.12). Moreover, 29 patients encountered a disturbed injection schedule, particularly skipping their injection appointments due to infection fear as found in 18 patients. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed pressing challenges in maintaining essential health care while ensuring the prevention of spread of infection. Although the modified injection protocol confirmed to be safe for patients, the pandemic caused deflection from the optimum practice in the form of successive skipping of appointments and delays in the processing of patient injection schedules.","Moussa, Magdy; Elshorbagy, Muhammed Sameh; Emarah, Ayman; Gaber, Raouf; Moussa, Omar M.; El-Bradey, Mohamed; Alagorie, Ahmed Roshdy; Sorour, Osama A.",Int Ophthalmol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33475906/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10792-021-01719-y,643

A key question is whether it is possible to make rational predictions of new therapies based on the presently available scientific and medical information. In this regard, I have noticed an omission in the present analysis in the literature related to the exploitation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) as a therapeutic approach. This is based on two key observations, that GSK-3 inhibitors can simultaneously block SARs viral replication, while boosting CD8+ adaptive T-cell and innate natural killer (NK) responses. Firstly, it is already clear that GSK-3 phosphorylation of SARs CoV1 N protein on key serine residues is needed for viral replication such that small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) of GSK-3 can inhibit viral replication. In comparing protein sequences, I show here that the key sites in the N protein of SARs CoV1 N for replication are conserved in SARs CoV2. This strongly suggests that GSK-3 SMIs will also inhibit SARs Cov2 replication. Secondly, we and others have previously documented that GSK-3 SMIs markedly enhance CD8+ cytolytic T-cell (CTL) and NK cell anti-viral effector functions leading to a reduction in both acute and chronic viral infections in mice. My hypothesis is that the repurposing of low-cost inhibitors of GSK-3 such as lithium will limit SARS-CoV2 infections by both reducing viral replication and potentiating the immune response against the virus. To date, there has been no mention of this dual connection between GSK-3 and SARs CoV2 in the literature. To my knowledge, no other drugs exist with the potential to simultaneously target both viral replication and immune response against SARs CoV2.","Rudd, Christopher E.",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32695123/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2020.01638,643

631029,ASPERGILOSIS PULMONAR INVASIVA EN PACIENTES CON SINDROME DE DISTRÉS RESPIRATORIO POR COVID-19,2021-04-20,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is a recently recognized viral infective disease which can be complicated by acute respiratory stress syndrome (ARDS) and cardiovascular complications including severe arrhythmias, acute coronary syndromes, myocarditis and pulmonary embolism. The aim of the present study was to identify the clinical conditions and echocardiographic parameters associated with in‐hospital mortality in COVID‐19. METHODS: This is a multicentre retrospective observational study including seven Italian centres. Patients hospitalized with COVID‐19 from 1 March to 22 April 2020 were included into study population. The association between baseline variables and risk of in‐hospital mortality was assessed through multivariable logistic regression and competing risk analyses. RESULTS: Out of 1401 patients admitted at the participating centres with confirmed diagnosis of COVID‐19, 226 (16.1%) underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and were included in the present analysis. In‐hospital death occurred in 68 patients (30.1%). At multivariable analysis, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF, P < .001), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE, P < .001) and ARDS (P < .001) were independently associated with in‐hospital mortality. At competing risk analysis, we found a significantly higher risk of mortality in patients with ARDS vs those without ARDS (HR: 7.66; CI: 3.95‐14.8), in patients with TAPSE ≤17 mm vs those with TAPSE >17 mm (HR: 5.08; CI: 3.15‐8.19) and in patients with LVEF ≤50% vs those with LVEF >50% (HR: 4.06; CI: 2.50‐6.59). CONCLUSIONS: TTE might be a useful tool in risk stratification of patients with COVID‐19. In particular, reduced LVEF and reduced TAPSE may help to identify patients at higher risk of death during hospitalization.","Silverio, Angelo; Di Maio, Marco; Scudiero, Fernando; Russo, Vincenzo; Esposito, Luca; Attena, Emilio; Pezzullo, Salvatore; Parodi, Guido; D'Andrea, Antonello; Damato, Antonio; Silvestro, Antonio; Iannece, Patrizia; Bellino, Michele; Di Vece, Davide; Borrelli, Anna; Citro, Rodolfo; Vecchione, Carmine; Galasso, Gennaro",Eur J Clin Invest,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34287861/; https://doi.org/10.1111/eci.13638,643

Thus, we aimed to develop a rapid viability RT-qPCR procedure to infer SARS-CoV-2 infectivity in clinical specimens and environmental samples. We screened monoazide dyes and platinum compounds as viability molecular markers on five SARS-CoV-2 RNA targets. A platinum chloride-based viability RT-qPCR was then optimized using genomic RNA, and inactivated SARS-CoV-2 particles inoculated in buffer, stool, and urine. Our results were finally validated in nasopharyngeal swabs from persons who tested positive for COVID-19 and in wastewater samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. We established a rapid viability RT-qPCR that selectively detects potentially infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles in complex matrices. In particular, the confirmed positivity of nasopharyngeal swabs following the viability procedure suggests their potential infectivity, while the complete prevention of amplification in wastewater indicated either non-infectious particles or free RNA. The viability RT-qPCR approach provides a more accurate ascertainment of the infectious viruses detection and it may complement analyses to foster risk-based investigations for the prevention and control of new or re-occurring outbreaks with a broad application spectrum.","Cuevas-Ferrando, Enric; Randazzo, Walter; Pérez-Cataluña, Alba; Falcó, Irene; Navarro, David; Martin-Latil, Sandra; Díaz-Reolid, Azahara; Girón-Guzmán, Inés; Allende, Ana; Sánchez, Gloria",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34518622/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-97700-x,643

In Japan, primary care is the frontline against emerging infectious diseases in communities. Although the importance of pandemic preparedness in primary care has been highlighted previously, few studies have thus far investigated the preparedness among primary care practices (PCPs) or differences in the preparedness of different institutional settings. We examined PCP preparedness and response to the 2009 influenza pandemic in Japan, and explored the role of a pandemic preparedness plan during the pandemic. METHODS: We used a survey questionnaire to assess how well individual PCPs in Okinawa, Japan, were prepared for the 2009 influenza pandemic. The questionnaire was mailed to all eligible PCPs (N = 465) in Okinawa, regardless of their institutional setting. In addition, we assessed the differences in the preparedness of clinics and hospitals and determined whether the national preparedness plan affected individual preparedness and response. Data were analyzed using descriptive and logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: A total of 174 (37.4%) PCPs responded to our survey. In general, high-level personal protective equipment (PPE) such as N95 masks (45.4%), gowns (30.5%), and eye protection (21.3%) was stocked at a low rate. Clinic-based PCPs were significantly less prepared than hospital-based PCPs to provide N95 masks (OR 0.34), gowns (OR 0.15), and eye protection (OR 0.18). In addition, only 32.8% of PCPs adopted an adequate business continuity plan (BCP). After controlling for institutional setting, reading the national preparedness plan was significantly associated with establishment of a BCP (OR 5.86), and with knowledge of how to transfer a swab specimen to a local medical laboratory (OR 5.60). CONCLUSIONS: With regard to PPE availability, PCPs (especially clinic-based PCPs) were not adequately prepared for the influenza pandemic. Awareness of the national pandemic preparedness plan is likely to promote prefecture-wide implementation of BCPs and surveillance activity.","Tomizuka, Taro; Kanatani, Yasuhiro; Kawahara, Kazuo",BMC Fam Pract,https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2296-14-174; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24252688/,643

In this exploratory work, the UV disinfection results of Bacillus subtilis spores in dried saliva droplets were fitted to a three-parameter kinetic model (R(2) ≥ 0.97). This model has a disinfection rate constant for single organisms and a smaller one for aggregates found in droplets. The fraction of organisms found in aggregates (β) could account for the effects of different-sized droplets in the experimental work. Since a wide spectrum of droplet sizes can be produced, and some of the rate constants were uncertain, Monte Carlo simulation was used to estimate the UV inactivation performance in dried saliva droplets in a variety of conditions. Using conservative distribution for β, the model was applied to the UV disinfection of SARS-CoV-2 in dried saliva droplets. It was shown that a one-log reduction of SARS-CoV-2 was very likely (p>99.9%) and a two-log reduction was probable (p=75%) at a dose of 60 mJ/cm(2). Aggregates tend to be variable and limit the log reductions that can be achieved at high UV doses.","Gibson, John; Farnood, Ramin; Barbeau, Benoit",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34595717/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-021-16537-z,643

The important reason for the increased global mortality is the impact of pneumonia on chronic diseases especially in the elderly population and the virulence factors of the causative microorganisms. Because elderly individuals present with comorbidities, particular attention should be paid for multidrug-resistant pathogens. Streptococcus pneumoniae remains the most frequently encountered pathogen. Enteric gram-negative rods, as well as anaerobes, should be considered in patients with aspiration pneumonia. Interventions for modifiable risk factors will reduce the risk of this infection. The adequacy of the initial antimicrobial therapy and determination of patients’ follow-up place is a key factor for prognosis. Also, vaccination is one of the most important preventive measures.

During the second wave of the pandemic, serological tests became routinely available. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the seroprevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies according to the use of disease-modifying therapy (DMT) in a subset of patients included in the MuSC-19 data set who had undergone a serological test. METHODS We evaluated the association between positive serological test results and time elapsed since infection onset, age, sex, Expanded Disability Status Scale score, comorbidities and DMT exposure using a multivariable logistic model. RESULTS Data were collected from 423 patients (345 from Italy, 61 from Turkey and 17 from Brazil) with a serological test performed during follow-up. Overall, 325 out of 423 tested patients (76.8%) had a positive serological test. At multivariate analysis, therapy with anti-CD20 was significantly associated with a reduced probability of developing antibodies after COVID-19 (odds ratio (OR) = 0.20, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION Patients with MS maintain the capacity to develop humoral immune response against SARS-COV-2, although to a lesser extent when treated with anti-CD20 drugs.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost–benefit relation of implementing point-of-care COVID-19 antigen testing (POCT) in emergency rooms (ER) of German hospitals. METHODS: A deterministic decision-analytic model simulated the incremental costs of using the Sofia® SARS Antigen FIA test compared to those of using clinical judgement alone to confirm or exclude COVID-19 in adult patients in German ER, prior to hospitalization. Direct and indirect costs, with and without subsequent RT-PCR confirmation, were evaluated from the hospital perspective. RESULTS: With respect to ER patients, in base-case analysis, considering a COVID- 19 prevalence of 15.6% and a hospitalization rate among COVID-19 suspects of 10.1%, POCT testing reduces average costs of hospitalized patients by €213 per tested patient if nasopharyngeal swabs of patients suspected to have COVID-19 are also sent to external labs for RT-PCR testing. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, under all reasonable assumptions, implementing the Sofia® SARS Antigen FIA saves on average about €210 as compared to applying the clinical-judgement-only strategy. The major part of cost savings, €159 or 75.9%, is due to the POC test´s high specificity resulting in a 21-fold lower proportion of unnecessary bed blocking at the first day of hospitalization.

BACKGROUND: Obesity is a major problem with rising prevalence in the western world. Hypertension is also a significant risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Self-report, remotely from the clinic, becomes even more essential when patients are encouraged to avoid visiting the clinic as during the COVID-19 pandemic. Self-reporting of height and weight is suspected of leading to underestimation of obesity prevalence in the population; however, it has not been well studied in the elderly population. The Health Belief Model tries to predict and explain decision making of patients based on the patient’s health beliefs. METHODS: Residents of a retirement home network filled a questionnaire about their health beliefs regarding hypertension and obesity and self-reported their height, weight, and blood pressure. Blood pressure, height, and weight were then measured and compared to the patients’ self-reporting. FINDINGS: Ninety residents, aged 84.90 ± 5.88, filled the questionnaire. From a clinical perspective, the overall gap between the measured and the self-reported BMI (M = 1.43, SD = 2.72), which represents an absolute gap of 0.74 kilograms and 2.95 centimeters, is expected to have only a mild influence on the physician’s clinical evaluation of the patient’s medical condition. This can allow the physician to estimate their patient’s BMI status before the medical consultation and physical examination upon the patient’s self-reporting. Patients’ dichotomous (normal/abnormal) self-report of their blood pressure condition was relatively credible: positive predictive value (PPV) of 77.78% for normal blood pressure (BP) and 78.57% for abnormal BP. The relatively high PPV of BP self-reporting demonstrates an option for the physician to recognize patients at risk.

661980,Rethinking licensing exams in the time of COVID-19 Repenser les examens pour l'obtention du permis d'exercice de la médecine en période de COVID-19,2021-02-26,"Recent studies indicate that detecting radiographic patterns on CT chest scans can yield high sensitivity and specificity for COVID-19 identification. In this paper, we scrutinize the effectiveness of deep learning models for semantic segmentation of pneumonia-infected area segmentation in CT images for the detection of COVID-19. Traditional methods for CT scan segmentation exploit a supervised learning paradigm, so they (a) require large volumes of data for their training, and (b) assume fixed (static) network weights once the training procedure has been completed. Recently, to overcome these difficulties, few-shot learning (FSL) has been introduced as a general concept of network model training using a very small amount of samples. In this paper, we explore the efficacy of few-shot learning in U-Net architectures, allowing for a dynamic fine-tuning of the network weights as new few samples are being fed into the U-Net. Experimental results indicate improvement in the segmentation accuracy of identifying COVID-19 infected regions. In particular, using 4-fold cross-validation results of the different classifiers, we observed an improvement of 5.388 ± 3.046% for all test data regarding the IoU metric and a similar increment of 5.394 ± 3.015% for the F1 score. Moreover, the statistical significance of the improvement obtained using our proposed few-shot U-Net architecture compared with the traditional U-Net model was confirmed by applying the Kruskal-Wallis test (p-value = 0.026).","Voulodimos, Athanasios; Protopapadakis, Eftychios; Katsamenis, Iason; Doulamis, Anastasios; Doulamis, Nikolaos",Sensors (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/s21062215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33810066/,643
662099,Ventiladores mecánicos de emergencia para la Covid-19,2020-05-31,"This section considers mortality rate data in Italy in March 2020 with a view to estimating Covid-19 mortality across the Italian regions. Deaths are classified by age group: a key factor that official reports have failed to include The Italian Higher Health Institute included subjects who tested positive to a swab and plotted data by region and age group at a national level. However, it did not provide information relating to deaths by age group in each region. In the present study deaths and mortality rates in March 2020 are analyzed first. Subsequently, the number of deaths from causes attributable to Covid-19 is estimated by comparing the number of deaths recorded in March 2020 with the number of deaths recorded in the same month over the previous 5 years, from 2015 to 2019. Starting with this comparison and keeping as a constraint the data provided by the ISS, that is the number of deaths from Covid-19 for each region and for each age group at national level, it was possible to obtain an estimate of deaths attributable to Covid-19, divided by age group in each region. Using mapping, the estimates are shown in a spatial layout that records different ages in each region. The results show that in some regions the impact on mortality was much higher than official data, which only accounted for subjects who had tested positive to swabbing. A visual mapping of these estimates confirms that Lombardy was the most affected region, in terms of both deaths and mortality rates. Regarding age, Covid-19 mortality is higher in the oldest age groups. The study also outlines a partition of Italy into three geographical areas, in accordance with different mortality rates and Covid-19 contagion severity. Results are represented using reflective mapping to better understand the impact of Covid-19 on mortality. The results confirm that the Covid-19 epidemic had a major impact on Italy, and an even more significant impact on Lombardy, also in terms of deaths and mortality.","Negri, Ilia; Mazzoleni, Marcella",Modern Cartography Series,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780323910613000193; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780323910613000193; https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-91061-3.00019-3,643
666302,Altas Concentraciones Séricas De Nitratos En Pacientes COVID-19 Fallecidos,2020-11-10,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge graphs are a common form of knowledge representation in biomedicine and many other fields. We developed an open biomedical knowledge graph–based system termed Reasoning Over Biomedical Objects linked in Knowledge Oriented Pathways (ROBOKOP). ROBOKOP consists of both a front-end user interface and a back-end knowledge graph. The ROBOKOP user interface allows users to posit questions and explore answer subgraphs. Users can also posit questions through direct Cypher query of the underlying knowledge graph, which currently contains roughly 6 million nodes or biomedical entities and 140 million edges or predicates describing the relationship between nodes, drawn from over 30 curated data sources. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to apply ROBOKOP to survey data on workplace exposures and immune-mediated diseases from the Environmental Polymorphisms Registry (EPR) within the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. METHODS: We analyzed EPR survey data and identified 45 associations between workplace chemical exposures and immune-mediated diseases, as self-reported by study participants (n= 4574), with 20 associations significant at P<.05 after false discovery rate correction. We then used ROBOKOP to (1) validate the associations by determining whether plausible connections exist within the ROBOKOP knowledge graph and (2) propose biological mechanisms that might explain them and serve as hypotheses for subsequent testing. We highlight the following three exemplar associations: carbon monoxide-multiple sclerosis, ammonia-asthma, and isopropanol-allergic disease. RESULTS: ROBOKOP successfully returned answer sets for three queries that were posed in the context of the driving examples. The answer sets included potential intermediary genes, as well as supporting evidence that might explain the observed associations. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate real-world application of ROBOKOP to generate mechanistic hypotheses for associations between workplace chemical exposures and immune-mediated diseases. We expect that ROBOKOP will find broad application across many biomedical fields and other scientific disciplines due to its generalizability, speed to discovery and generation of mechanistic hypotheses, and open nature.","Fecho, Karamarie; Bizon, Chris; Miller, Frederick; Schurman, Shepherd; Schmitt, Charles; Xue, William; Morton, Kenneth; Wang, Patrick; Tropsha, Alexander",JMIR Med Inform,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34283031/; https://doi.org/10.2196/26714,643

The COVID-19 and previous emerging virus outbreaks highlight the urgent need for broad-spectrum antivirals. Here, we show that a defensin-like peptide P9R exhibited potent antiviral activity against pH-dependent viruses that require endosomal acidification for virus infection, including the enveloped pandemic A(H1N1)pdm09 virus, avian influenza A(H7N9) virus, coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV), and the non-enveloped rhinovirus. P9R can significantly protect mice from lethal challenge by A(H1N1)pdm09 virus and shows low possibility to cause drug-resistant virus. Mechanistic studies indicate that the antiviral activity of P9R depends on the direct binding to viruses and the inhibition of virus-host endosomal acidification, which provides a proof of concept that virus-binding alkaline peptides can broadly inhibit pH-dependent viruses. These results suggest that the dual-functional virus- and host-targeting P9R can be a promising candidate for combating pH-dependent respiratory viruses.","Zhao, Hanjun; To, Kelvin K.

Since health news affect people’s attitudes and health behaviors, this study analyzed the coverage by three Chilean online newspapers with the largest readership regarding the relation between diet and mental health in 2016. A previously constructed corpus of 2551 news items about food was analyzed quantitatively. The results show that the relevance of the topic diet and mental health was low in all three newspapers. The most frequent type of information was on “foods” and not “nutrients” that “benefit”—not that “damage”—mental health. The quality of the news was poor as a narrow range of sources was found.

Recombinant IFN-α1 protein was produced in E. coli and purified from inclusion bodies. Recombinant camel IFN-α1 induced the mRNA expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in camel kidney cells. The purified protein also showed potent in-vitro antiviral activity against Camelpox Virus in kidney cells.

While fever, cough, and respiratory distress are typical first symptoms, a fraction of those affected present instead with neurological symptoms suggestive of central nervous system compromise. This review summarizes the potential contribution of coronavirus disease 2019 to hemorrhagic stroke in the elderly and proposes possible mechanisms. Reports show that the most affected patients have underlying chronic diseases such as hypertension and diabetes, which are two key risk factors for hemorrhagic stroke. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is the main host cell surface receptor interacting with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike glycoprotein to allow viral entry and infection. We speculate that ensuing downregulation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression may compound the risk conferred by pre-existing comorbidities and critically influence the pathogenesis of hemorrhagic stroke by elevating blood pressure and impairing cerebrovascular endothelial function. Additionally, both age- and/or disease-related immune dysfunction and enhanced catecholamine release secondary to anxiety and stress may also aggravate central nervous system symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. Thus, assessment of systemic inflammatory biomarkers and tight control of hemodynamic parameters upon admission are crucial to minimize mortality and morbidity in coronavirus disease 2019 patients with central nervous system symptoms suggestive of incipient stroke.","Wang, Haili; Tang, Xiaojia; Fan, Hongyang; Luo, Yuhan; Song, Yuxia; Xu, Yao; Chen, Yingzhu",Aging (Albany NY),https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.103335; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32527987/,643

676651,Interacciones medicamentosas potenciales en pacientes COVID 19 en tratamiento con lopinavir/ritonavir,2020-07-09,"Since the first reports of pneumonia associated with a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, there have been considerable efforts to sequence the causative virus, SARS-CoV-2 (also referred to as hCoV-19) and to make viral genomic information available quickly on shared repositories. As of 30 March 2020, 7,680 consensus sequences have been shared on GISAID, the principal repository for SARS-CoV-2 genetic information. These sequences are primarily consensus sequences from clinical and passaged samples, but few reports have looked at diversity of virus populations within individual hosts or cultures. Understanding such diversity is essential to understanding viral evolutionary dynamics. Here, we characterize within-host viral diversity from a primary isolate and passaged samples, all originally deriving from an individual returning from Wuhan, China, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 and subsequently sampled in Wisconsin, United States. We use a metagenomic approach with Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) GridION in combination with Illumina MiSeq to capture minor within-host frequency variants ≥1%. In a clinical swab obtained from the day of hospital presentation, we identify 15 single nucleotide variants (SNVs) ≥1% frequency, primarily located in the largest gene – ORF1a. While viral diversity is low overall, the dominant genetic signatures are likely secondary to population size changes, with some evidence for mild purifying selection throughout the genome. We see little to no evidence for positive selection or ongoing adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 within cell culture or in the primary isolate evaluated in this study. Author Summary Within-host variants are critical for addressing molecular evolution questions, identifying selective pressures imposed by vaccine-induced immunity and antiviral therapeutics, and characterizing interhost dynamics, including the stringency and character of transmission bottlenecks. Here, we sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viruses isolated from a human host and from cell culture on three distinct Vero cell lines using Illumina and ONT technologies. We show that SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences can remain stable through at least two serial passages on Vero 76 cells, suggesting SARS-CoV-2 can be propagated in cell culture in preparation for in-vitro and in-vivo studies without dramatic alterations of its genotype. However, we emphasize the need to deep-sequence viral stocks prior to use in experiments to characterize sub-consensus diversity that may alter outcomes.","Moreno, Gage K.; Braun, Katarina M.; Halfmann, Peter J.; Prall, Trent M.; Riemersma, Kasen K.; Haj, Amelia K.; Lalli, Joseph; Florek, Kelsey R.; Kawaoka, Yoshihiro; Friedrich, Thomas C.; O’Connor, David H.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.051011,643

However, many scientists disagree, and it is essential to understand that several factors and variables can cause a false-negative test. In this context, cycle threshold (Ct) values are being utilized to diagnose or predict SARS-CoV-2 infection. This practice has a significant clinical utility as Ct values can be correlated with the viral load. In addition, Ct values have a strong correlation with multiple haematological and biochemical markers. However, it is essential to consider that Ct values might be affected by pre-analytic, analytic, and post-analytical variables such as collection technique, specimen type, sampling time, viral kinetics, transport and storage conditions, nucleic acid extraction, viral RNA load, primer designing, real-time PCR efficiency, and Ct value determination method. Therefore, understanding the interpretation of Ct values and other influential factors could play a crucial role in interpreting viral load and disease severity. In several clinical studies consisting of small or large sample sizes, several discrepancies exist regarding a significant positive correlation between the Ct value and disease severity in COVID-19.

In the case of rhabdoviruses, entry is facilitated exclusively by the envelope glycoprotein G and its interactions with the host cell. For vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), attachment to the cell surface was thought to be facilitated by interactions with the lipid phosphatidylserine, however recent work suggests that it is in fact initiated by recognition of proteinaeous receptors. Clathrin-mediated endocytosis delivers the virions into endosomes where they have been proposed to traffic to multi-vesicular bodies. There, the viral envelope fuses with internal vesicles in a process mediated by glycoprotein G in a pH- and phosphatidylserine-dependent manner. A clear mechanistic understanding of glycoprotein G mediated fusion has yet to be obtained, however current data suggests that it is likely facilitated by events distinct from Class I or Class II fusion proteins of other viruses. Rhabdoviruses are also notable in that their fusion protein exists in a reversible pH-dependent equilibrium, which prevents irreversible preactivation during assembly, and may prove to be relevant in the mediation of cell-to-cell fusion - an alternate form of viral spread.","Regan, Andrew D.; Whittaker, Gary R.",Viral Entry into Host Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23884591/; https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4614-7651-1_9,643

An overview of the implementation, optimization as well as critical considerations",2021-01-28,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has unprecedented implications for public health, social life, and world economy. Since approved drugs and vaccines are not available, new options for COVID-19 treatment and prevention are highly demanded. To identify SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, we analysed the antibody response of 12 COVID-19 patients from 8 to 69 days post diagnosis. By screening 4,313 SARS-CoV-2-reactive B cells, we isolated 255 antibodies from different time points as early as 8 days post diagnosis. Among these, 28 potently neutralized authentic SARS-CoV-2 (IC100 as low as 0.04 μg/ml), showing a broad spectrum of V genes and low levels of somatic mutations. Interestingly, potential precursors were identified in naïve B cell repertoires from 48 healthy individuals that were sampled before the COVID-19 pandemic. Our results demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies are readily generated from a diverse pool of precursors, fostering the hope of rapid induction of a protective immune response upon vaccination.","Kreer, Christoph; Zehner, Matthias; Weber, Timm; Rohde, Cornelius; Halwe, Sandro; Ercanoglu, Meryem S.; Gieselmann, Lutz; Korenkov, Michael; Gruell, Henning; Schommers, Philipp; Vanshylla, Kanika; Di Cristanziano, Veronica; Janicki, Hanna; Brinker, Reinhild; Ashurov, Artem; Krähling, Verena; Kupke, Alexandra; Cohen-Dvashi, Hadas; Koch, Manuel; Lederer, Simone; Pfeifer, Nico; Wolf, Timo; Vehreschild, Maria J.G.T.; Wendtner, Clemens; Diskin, Ron; Becker, Stephan; Klein, Florian",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.12.146290,643
