1906,Epidemic Wave Dynamics Attributable to Urban Community Structure: A Theoretical Characterization of Disease Transmission in a Large Network,2015-07-08,"BACKGROUND: Multiple waves of transmission during infectious disease epidemics represent a major public health challenge, but the ecological and behavioral drivers of epidemic resurgence are poorly understood. In theory, community structure—aggregation into highly intraconnected and loosely interconnected social groups—within human populations may lead to punctuated outbreaks as diseases progress from one community to the next. However, this explanation has been largely overlooked in favor of temporal shifts in environmental conditions and human behavior and because of the difficulties associated with estimating large-scale contact patterns. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to characterize naturally arising patterns of human contact that are capable of producing simulated epidemics with multiple wave structures. METHODS: We used an extensive dataset of proximal physical contacts between users of a public Wi-Fi Internet system to evaluate the epidemiological implications of an empirical urban contact network. We characterized the modularity (community structure) of the network and then estimated epidemic dynamics under a percolation-based model of infectious disease spread on the network. We classified simulated epidemics as multiwave using a novel metric and we identified network structures that were critical to the network’s ability to produce multiwave epidemics. RESULTS: We identified robust community structure in a large, empirical urban contact network from which multiwave epidemics may emerge naturally. This pattern was fueled by a special kind of insularity in which locally popular individuals were not the ones forging contacts with more distant social groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that ordinary contact patterns can produce multiwave epidemics at the scale of a single urban area without the temporal shifts that are usually assumed to be responsible. Understanding the role of community structure in epidemic dynamics allows officials to anticipate epidemic resurgence without having to forecast future changes in hosts, pathogens, or the environment.","Hoen, Anne G; Hladish, Thomas J; Eggo, Rosalind M; Lenczner, Michael; Brownstein, John S; Meyers, Lauren Ancel",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4526984/,326
3841,Identifying Protective Health Behaviors on Twitter: Observational Study of Travel Advisories and Zika Virus,2019-05-13,"BACKGROUND: An estimated 3.9 billion individuals live in a location endemic for common mosquito-borne diseases. The emergence of Zika virus in South America in 2015 marked the largest known Zika outbreak and caused hundreds of thousands of infections. Internet data have shown promise in identifying human behaviors relevant for tracking and understanding other diseases. OBJECTIVE: Using Twitter posts regarding the 2015-16 Zika virus outbreak, we sought to identify and describe considerations and self-disclosures of a specific behavior change relevant to the spread of disease—travel cancellation. If this type of behavior is identifiable in Twitter, this approach may provide an additional source of data for disease modeling. METHODS: We combined keyword filtering and machine learning classification to identify first-person reactions to Zika in 29,386 English-language tweets in the context of travel, including considerations and reports of travel cancellation. We further explored demographic, network, and linguistic characteristics of users who change their behavior compared with control groups. RESULTS: We found differences in the demographics, social networks, and linguistic patterns of 1567 individuals identified as changing or considering changing travel behavior in response to Zika as compared with a control sample of Twitter users. We found significant differences between geographic areas in the United States, significantly more discussion by women than men, and some evidence of differences in levels of exposure to Zika-related information. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have implications for informing the ways in which public health organizations communicate with the public on social media, and the findings contribute to our understanding of the ways in which the public perceives and acts on risks of emerging infectious diseases.","Daughton, Ashlynn R; Paul, Michael J",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6535980/,326
14628,Evaluating Behavioral and Linguistic Changes During Drug Treatment for Depression Using Tweets in Spanish: Pairwise Comparison Study,2020-12-18,"Arbovirus infection in Aedes aegypti has historically been quantified from a sample of the adult population by pooling collected mosquitoes to increase detectability. However, there is a significant knowledge gap about the magnitude of natural arbovirus infection within areas of active transmission, as well as the sensitivity of detection of such an approach. We used indoor Ae. aegypti sequential sampling with Prokopack aspirators to collect all mosquitoes inside 200 houses with suspected active ABV transmission from the city of Mérida, Mexico, and tested all collected specimens by RT-PCR to quantify: a) the absolute arbovirus infection rate in individually tested Ae. aegypti females; b) the sensitivity of using Prokopack aspirators in detecting ABV-infected mosquitoes; and c) the sensitivity of entomological inoculation rate (EIR) and vectorial capacity (VC), two measures ABV transmission potential, to different estimates of indoor Ae. aegypti abundance. The total number of Ae. aegypti (total catch, the sum of all Ae. aegypti across all collection intervals) as well as the number on the first 10-min of collection (sample, equivalent to a routine adult aspiration session) were calculated. We individually tested by RT-PCR 2,161 Aedes aegypti females and found that 7.7% of them were positive to any ABV. Most infections were CHIKV (77.7%), followed by DENV (11.4%) and ZIKV (9.0%). The distribution of infected Aedes aegypti was overdispersed; 33% houses contributed 81% of the infected mosquitoes. A significant association between ABV infection and Ae. aegypti total catch indoors was found (binomial GLMM, Odds Ratio > 1). A 10-min indoor Prokopack collection led to a low sensitivity of detecting ABV infection (16.3% for detecting infected mosquitoes and 23.4% for detecting infected houses). When averaged across all infested houses, mean EIR ranged between 0.04 and 0.06 infective bites per person per day, and mean VC was 0.6 infectious vectors generated from a population feeding on a single infected host per house/day. Both measures were significantly and positively associated with Ae. aegypti total catch indoors. Our findings provide evidence that the accurate estimation and quantification of arbovirus infection rate and transmission risk is a function of the sampling effort, the local abundance of Aedes aegypti and the intensity of arbovirus circulation.","Kirstein, Oscar David; Ayora-Talavera, Guadalupe; Koyoc-Cardeña, Edgar; Chan Espinoza, Daniel; Che-Mendoza, Azael; Cohuo-Rodriguez, Azael; Granja-Pérez, Pilar; Puerta-Guardo, Henry; Pavia-Ruz, Norma; Dunbar, Mike W.; Manrique-Saide, Pablo; Vazquez-Prokopec, Gonzalo M.",PLoS Negl Trop Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7781390/,326
14983,Economic Burden and Health Care Access for Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Diseases in China: Web-Based Survey Study,2021-01-05,"Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common genetic heart disease. While ≈50% of patients with HCM carry a sarcomere gene mutation (sarcomere mutation-positive, HCM(SMP)), the genetic background is unknown in the other half of the patients (sarcomere mutation-negative, HCM(SMN)). Genotype-specific differences have been reported in cardiac function. Moreover, HCM(SMN) patients have later disease onset and a better prognosis than HCM(SMP) patients. To define if genotype-specific derailments at the protein level may explain the heterogeneity in disease development, we performed a proteomic analysis in cardiac tissue from a clinically well-phenotyped HCM patient group. METHODS: A proteomics screen was performed in cardiac tissue from 39 HCM(SMP) patients, 11HCM(SMN) patients, and 8 nonfailing controls. Patients with HCM had obstructive cardiomyopathy with left ventricular outflow tract obstruction and diastolic dysfunction. A novel MYBPC3(2373insG) mouse model was used to confirm functional relevance of our proteomic findings. RESULTS: In all HCM patient samples, we found lower levels of metabolic pathway proteins and higher levels of extracellular matrix proteins. Levels of total and detyrosinated α-tubulin were markedly higher in HCM(SMP) than in HCM(SMN) and controls. Higher tubulin detyrosination was also found in 2 unrelated MYBPC3 mouse models and its inhibition with parthenolide normalized contraction and relaxation time of isolated cardiomyocytes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that microtubules and especially its detyrosination contribute to the pathomechanism of patients with HCM(SMP). This is of clinical importance since it represents a potential treatment target to improve cardiac function in patients with HCM(SMP), whereas a beneficial effect may be limited in patients with HCM(SMN).","Schuldt, Maike; Pei, Jiayi; Harakalova, Magdalena; Dorsch, Larissa M.; Schlossarek, Saskia; Mokry, Michal; Knol, Jaco C.; Pham, Thang V.; Schelfhorst, Tim; Piersma, Sander R.; dos Remedios, Cris; Dalinghaus, Michiel; Michels, Michelle; Asselbergs, Folkert W.; Moutin, Marie-Jo; Carrier, Lucie; Jimenez, Connie R.; van der Velden, Jolanda; Kuster, Diederik W.D.",Circ Heart Fail,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7819533/,326

17372,Investigating the Use of Electronic Well-being Diaries Completed Within a Psychoeducation Program for University Students: Longitudinal Text Analysis Study,2021-04-22,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to investigate the clinical feasibility of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) for the detection of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) in patients with poor-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) treated with coil embolization. METHODS: Cerebral regional oxygen saturation (rSO(2)) was continuously monitored via two-channel NIRS for 14 days following SAH. The rSO(2) levels according to DCI were analyzed by using the Mann–Whitney U-test. A receiver operating characteristic curve was generated on the basis of changes in rSO(2) by using the rSO(2) level on day 1 as a reference value to determine the optimal cutoff value for identifying DCI. RESULTS: Twenty-four patients with poor-grade SAH were included (DCI, n = 8 [33.3%]; non-DCI, n = 16 [66.7%]). The rSO(2) levels of patients with DCI were significantly lowered from 6 to 9 days compared with those in without DCI. The rSO(2) level was 62.55% (58.30–63.40%) on day 6 in patients with DCI versus 65.40% (60.90–68.70%) in those without DCI. By day 7, it was 60.40% (58.10–61.90%) in patients with DCI versus 64.25% (62.50–67.10%) those without DCI. By day 8, it was 58.90% (56.50–63.10%) in patients with DCI versus 66.05% (59.90–69.20%) in those without DCI, and by day 9, it was 60.85% (58.40–65.20%) in patients with DCI versus 65.80% (62.70–68.30%) in those without DCI. A decline of greater than 14.5% in the rSO(2) rate yielded a sensitivity of 92.86% (95% confidence interval: 66.1–99.8%) and a specificity of 88.24% (95% confidence interval: 72.5–96.7%) for identifying DCI. A decrease by more than 14.7% of the rSO(2) level indicates a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 85.7% for identifying DCI. CONCLUSIONS: Near-infrared spectroscopy shows some promising results for the detection of DCI in patients with poor-grade SAH. Further studies involving a large cohort of the SAH population are required to confirm our results.

17476,Suicide prevention training,2021-05-14,"Beehive products possess nutritional value and health-promoting properties and are recommended as so-called “superfoods”. However, because of their natural origin, they may contain relevant elemental contaminants. Therefore, to assess the quality of bee products, we examined concentrations of a broad range of 24 selected elements in propolis, bee pollen, and royal jelly. The quantitative analyses were performed with inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) techniques. The results of our research indicate that bee products contain essential macronutrients (i.e., K, P, and S) and micronutrients (i.e., Zn and Fe) in concentrations depending on the products’ type. However, the presence of toxic heavy metals makes it necessary to test the quality of bee products before using them as dietary supplements. Bearing in mind that bee products are highly heterogenous and, depending on the environmental factors, differ in their elemental content, it is necessary to develop standards regulating the acceptable levels of inorganic pollutants. Furthermore, since bees and their products are considered to be an effective biomonitoring tool, our results may reflect the environment’s condition in west-central Poland, affecting the health and well-being of both humans and bees.","Matuszewska, Eliza; Klupczynska, Agnieszka; Maciołek, Krzysztof; Kokot, Zenon J.; Matysiak, Jan",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8122449/,326
19661,Prediction of Asthma Hospitalizations for the Common Cold Using Google Trends: Infodemiology Study,2021-07-06,"BACKGROUND: Conventional clinical trials are essential for generating high-quality evidence by measuring the efficacy of interventions in rigorously controlled clinical environments. However, their execution can be expensive and time-consuming. In addition, clinical trials face several logistical challenges regarding the identification, recruitment, and retention of participants; consistent data collection during trials; and adequate patient follow-up. This might lead to inefficient resource utilization. In order to partially address the current problems with conventional clinical trials, there exists the need for innovations. One such innovation is the virtual clinical trial (VCT). VCTs allow for the collection and integration of diverse data from multiple information sources, such as electronic health records, clinical and demographic data, patient-reported outcomes, anthropometric and activity measurements, and data collected by digital biomarkers or (small) samples that participants can collect themselves. Although VCTs have the potential to provide substantial value to clinical research and patients because they can lower clinical trial costs, increase the volume of data collected from patients’ daily environment, and reduce the burden of patient participation, so far VCT adoption is not commonplace. OBJECTIVE: This paper aims to better understand the barriers and facilitators to VCT adoption by determining the factors that influence individuals’ considerations regarding VCTs from the perspective of various stakeholders. METHODS: Based on online semistructured interviews, a qualitative study was conducted with pharmaceutical companies, food and health organizations, and an applied research organization in Europe. Data were thematically analyzed using Rogers’ diffusion of innovation theory. RESULTS: A total of 16 individuals with interest and experience in VCTs were interviewed, including persons from pharmaceutical companies (n=6), food and health organizations (n=4), and a research organization (n=6). Key barriers included a potentially low degree of acceptance by regulatory authorities, technical issues (standardization, validation, and data storage), compliance and adherence, and lack of knowledge or comprehension regarding the opportunities VCTs have to offer. Involvement of regulators in development processes, stakeholder exposure to the results of pilot studies, and clear and simple instructions and assistance for patients were considered key facilitators. CONCLUSIONS: Collaboration among all stakeholders in VCT development is crucial to increase knowledge and awareness. Organizations should invest in accurate data collection technologies, and compliance of patients in VCTs needs to be ensured. Multicriteria decision analysis can help determine if a VCT is a preferred option by stakeholders. The findings of this study can be a good starting point to accelerate the development and widespread implementation of VCTs.","Coert, Romée Melanie Helena; Timmis, James Kenneth; Boorsma, André; Pasman, Wilrike J",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8294122/,326
21497,Online Public Attention Toward Premature Ejaculation in Mainland China: Infodemiology Study Using the Baidu Index,2021-08-26,"Robust assays to quantify adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector expression and potency are essential for gene therapy development. These assays inform the efficacy, safety, and pharmacodynamic profiles of AAV development candidates. Additionally, for gene downregulation strategies such as RNAi, knockdown of endogenous genes reflects the mechanism of action of such development candidates. Therefore, a method to quantify target mRNA repression is necessary for measuring vector potency both in vitro and in vivo. Here, we report the development of a one-step reverse-transcription droplet digital PCR (RT-ddPCR) method to analyze expression of AAV vectors and the potency of AAV-RNAi vectors. This one-step RT-ddPCR method simplifies the workflow, allows for duplexing reactions, and enables absolute quantification of transcripts without standard materials. With a gene augmentation vector, we demonstrate the application of RT-ddPCR in quantifying vector expression in vitro and in non-human primate (NHP) samples. This novel method is demonstrated to be precise and linear within the range of 0.05–25 ng of RNA input. Using an AAV-RNAi vector, we further demonstrate the utility of this RT-ddPCR method in quantifying potency. Orthogonal potency assays, including ELISA and functional readout, correlate well with RT-ddPCR results. Therefore, one-step RT-ddPCR can be implemented in the analytical and pharmacological characterization of AAV vectors.","Clarner, Pete; Lau, Shukkwan K.; Chowdhury, Twinkle; Guilmette, Edward; Trapa, Patrick; Lo, Shih-Ching; Shen, Shen",Mol Ther Methods Clin Dev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8449018/,326
36481,Updated oral health strategy,2020-07-10,"In this paper, we propose a method to visualize blood flow of palm in different muscle tense state using RGB high-speed camera. Recently, new modalities are needed to develop a more accurate system to non-contact multi-modal affect analysis. Then, we focus on muscle tense. The muscle tense is caused by stress. Hence, the muscle tense is one of the effective modalities for non-contact multi-modal affect analysis. However, it is very difficult to measure muscle tense in the real environment because it requires a contact-type sensor. Therefore, we use iPPG to visualize the pulse wave during muscle tense from the skin video taken with the RGB video camera. As a result of this experiment, we found that it was possible to recognize the difference in pulse wave during muscle tense from the video that visualized the pulse wave. From this result, the realization of non-contact measurement of muscle tense can be expected.","Takahashi, Ryo; Ogawa-Ochiai, Keiko; Tsumura, Norimichi",Image and Signal Processing,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7340915/,326

57185,Correction: Screening Tools: Their Intended Audiences and Purposes. Comment on “Diagnostic Accuracy of Web-Based COVID-19 Symptom Checkers: Comparison Study”,2021-06-18,"Heat stress (HS) adversely affects several physiological responses in organisms, but the underlying molecular mechanisms involved are yet to be fully understood. L-Citrulline (L-Cit) is a nutraceutical amino acid that is gaining research interest for its role in body temperature regulation and nitric oxide synthesis. This study investigated whether dietary supplementation with L-Cit (1% of basal diet) could ameliorate the effects of acute HS on thermotolerance, redox balance, and inflammatory responses of broilers. Ross 308 broilers (288 chicks) were subjected to two environments; thermoneutral at 24°C (TNZ) or HS at 35°C for 5 h, and fed two diets; control or L-Cit. The results showed that HS increased the ear, rectal (RT), and core body (CBT) temperatures of broilers, along with higher respiratory rate. The RT and CBT readings were intermittently affected with time effect, whereas, L-Cit supplementation lowered the mean CBT than the control diet. Antioxidant assays showed that superoxide dismutase was increased during HS, while, catalase was promoted by L-Cit supplementation. In addition, L-Cit induced glutathione peroxidase activity compared to the control diet during HS. Hypothalamic heat shock protein (HSP)-90 was upregulated by HS, but L-Cit downregulated heat shock factor (HSF)-1, and HSP 60 mRNA expressions. HSF 3 mRNA expression was downregulated by L-Cit under TNZ condition. More so, HS increased the plasma nitric oxide (NO) concentration but lowered the total NO synthase (tNOS) activity. In contrast, L-Cit supplementation limited NO production but increased the tNOS activity. Arginase activity was increased in the control fed group during HS but L-Cit supplementation lowered this effect. The NOS-COX pathway was significantly affected under TNZ condition, since L-Cit supplementation downregulated the mRNA expression of iNOS-COX2 in the hypothalamus, and further reduced the serum PGE2 concentration. Together, these data indicates that L-Cit influenced the antioxidant defense, heat shock response and nitric oxide regeneration both under thermoneutral and HS conditions; and that L-Cit may be directly and/or indirectly involved in the central regulation of body temperature.","Uyanga, Victoria A.; Wang, Minghui; Tong, Tian; Zhao, Jingpeng; Wang, Xiaojuan; Jiao, Hongchao; Onagbesan, Okanlawon M.; Lin, Hai",Front Physiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8385788/,326

To clarify the role of viral infections in OM, we compared the relative contribution of viruses and bacteria with the induction of inflammatory cytokine responses in the middle ear of children suffering from OM. METHODS Children up to 5 years of age, with recurrent or chronic episodes of OM and scheduled for ventilation tube insertion were enrolled in a prospective study. Middle ear fluids (n = 116) were collected during surgery, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect bacterial and viral otopathogens, that is, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis and 15 respiratory viruses. Finally, concentrations of the inflammatory mediators interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-17a and tumor necrosis factor-α were determined. RESULTS Middle ear fluids were clustered into 4 groups, based on the detection of viruses (28%), bacteria (27%), both bacteria and viruses (27%) or no otopathogens (19%). Bacterial detection was associated with significantly elevated concentrations of cytokines compared with middle ear fluids without bacteria (P < 0.001 for all cytokines tested) in a bacterial load-dependent and species-dependent manner. In contrast, the presence of viruses was not associated with changes in cytokine values, and no synergistic effect between viral-bacterial coinfections was observed. CONCLUSIONS The presence of bacteria, but not viruses, is associated with an increased inflammatory response in the middle ear of children with recurrent or chronic OM.","Stol, Kim; Diavatopoulos, Dimitri A; Graamans, Kees; Engel, Joost A M; Melchers, Willem J G; Savelkoul, Huub F J; Hays, John P; Warris, Adilia; Hermans, Peter W M",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0b013e3182611d6b; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22668804/,326
71938,COVID-19 Pandemic-Induced Late-Onset Psychotic Depression With Catatonia.,2021-02-18,"BACKGROUND Recommendations against prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing in 2012 have increased advanced-stage diagnosis and prostate cancer-specific mortality rates. OBJECTIVE To present the position of the European Association of Urology (EAU) in 2021 and provide recommendations for the use of PSA testing as part of a risk-adapted strategy for the early detection of prostate cancer. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION The authors combined their review of relevant literature, including the EAU prostate cancer guidelines 2021 update, with their own knowledge to provide an expert opinion, representing the EAU's position in 2021. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS The EAU has developed a risk-adapted early prostate cancer detection strategy for well-informed men based on PSA testing, risk calculators, and multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, which can differentiate significant from insignificant prostate cancer. This approach largely avoids the overdiagnosis/overtreatment of men unlikely to experience disease-related symptoms during their lifetime and facilitates an early diagnosis of men with significant cancer to receive active treatment. It also reduces advanced-stage diagnosis, thereby potentially reducing prostate cancer-specific mortality and improving quality of life. Education is required among urologists, general practitioners, radiologists, policy makers, and healthy men, including endorsement by the European Commission to adapt the European Council's screening recommendations in its 2022 plan and requests to individual countries for its incorporation into national cancer plans. CONCLUSIONS This risk-adapted approach for the early detection of prostate cancer will reverse current unfavourable trends and ultimately save lives. PATIENT SUMMARY The European Association of Urology has developed a patient information leaflet and algorithm for the early diagnosis of prostate cancer. It can identify men who do not need magnetic resonance imaging or a biopsy and those who would not show any symptoms versus those with more aggressive disease who require further tests/treatment. We need to raise awareness of this algorithm to ensure that all well-informed men at risk of significant prostate cancer are offered a prostate-specific antigen test. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: A risk-adapted early prostate cancer detection strategy, incorporating prostate-specific antigen testing, multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging, risk calculators, and biomarkers, will avoid overdiagnosis/overtreatment of insignificant cancers and ensure early detection and treatment of significant cancers, thereby improving quality of life and reducing prostate cancer-related deaths.","Van Poppel, Hendrik; Roobol, Monique J; Chapple, Christopher R; Catto, James W F; N'Dow, James; Sønksen, Jens; Stenzl, Arnulf; Wirth, Manfred",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2021.07.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34407909/,326

This study aims to characterize how UCCs manage Medicaid and privately insured patients who present with an emergent condition. METHODS Using a standardized script, we called 1245 randomly selected UCCs in 50 states on 2 occasions. Investigators posed as either a Medicaid or a privately-insured patient with symptoms of an incarcerated inguinal hernia. Rates of direct emergency department (ED) referral were compared between insurance types. RESULTS A total of 1223 (98.2%) UCCs accepted private insurance and 981 (78.8%) accepted Medicaid. At the 971 (78.0%) UCCs that accepted both insurance types, direct-to-ED referral rates for private and Medicaid patients were 27.9% and 33.8%, respectively. Medicaid patients were significantly more likely than private patients to be referred to the ED [odds ratio (OR) 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.09-1.60]. Private patients who were triaged by a clinician compared to nonclinician staff were over 6 times more likely to be referred to the ED (OR 6.46, 95% CI 4.63-9.01). Medicaid patients were nearly 9 times more likely to have an ED referral when triaged by a clinician (OR 8.72, 95% CI 6.19-12.29). CONCLUSIONS Only one-third of UCCs across the United States referred an apparent emergent surgical case to the ED, potentially delaying care. Medicaid patients were more likely to be referred directly to the ED versus privately insured patients. All patients triaged by clinicians were significantly more likely to be referred to the ED; however, the disparity between private and Medicaid patients remained.","Hsiang, Walter R; Wiznia, Daniel; Yousman, Laurie; Najem, Michael; Mosier-Mills, Alison; Jin, Grace; Jain, Siddharth; Khunte, Akshay; Davis, Kimberly A; Forman, Howard P; Schuster, Kevin M",Annals of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/sla.0000000000004373; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32932304/,326
114660,An innovative and authentic way of learning how to consult remotely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.,2021-04-29,"AIM The continent ileostomy allows evacuation of an ileal reservoir at a time convenient to the patient. It is a surgical option for patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) when a restorative option is not suitable or has not succeeded and the patient does not want a conventional end ileostomy. Continent ileostomy types include the Kock pouch, Barnett continent intestinal reservoir and T-pouch. All of the published evidence on the long-term outcome and quality of life after continent ileostomy for UC was systematically reviewed. METHODS A systematic review was performed in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies published between 1990 and 2020 were included. A descriptive synthesis was used due to the clinical heterogeneity. RESULTS The search returned 1,655 abstracts and after screening of abstracts and full text review, 19 were included in the final review, involving 1,602 patients. Operative mortality is low (0-3.6%) after all types of continent ileostomy but re-operation rates are high (20.8-65%) because of valve mechanism failures. Rates of fistulae (0-25.5%) and stomal stenosis (0-25%) can be relatively high post-operatively. Quality of life scores improve for most patients undergoing continent ileostomy, especially for patients converted from ileal pouch anal anastomosis. Overall, continent ileostomy retention is high in the long-term. DISCUSSION In the long-term patients report high satisfaction and a good quality of life with continent ileostomy, despite high re-operation rates and complications. Newer technologies may reinvigorate interest in the continent ileostomy for this population.","Deputy, Mohammed; Worley, Guy; Patel, Komal; Fletcher, Jordan; Hart, Ailsa; Block, Mattias; Øresland, Tom; Myrelid, Pär; Faiz, Omar",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/codi.15788; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34166559/,326

The purpose of this review is to describe and analyze current urogynecologic guidelines for optimizing usage of telemedicine when treating women with pelvic floor disorders. RECENT FINDINGS Women managed by urogynecologists are on average older, and hence more likely to have comorbidities that make them susceptible to developing coronavirus disease 2019 with severe symptoms. Telemedicine is key in minimizing exposure without sacrificing treatments and quality of life. Recent studies published prior to the pandemic helped set the stage for successful components of virtual care. Nonsurgical options are crucial to beginning a treatment plan while elective surgeries are still restricted in many hospitals. Medication management and innovative technology, such as smart telephone applications, play a prominent role. The comprehensive literature review discussed here describes the degree of evidence supporting each management option, while also noting the limitations of telemedicine. SUMMARY Telemedicine has opened a new door for the field of urogynecology allowing for continued safe, evidence-based care. The pandemic culture has tipped the balance away from surgery and toward nonsurgical treatments while attempting not to sacrifice outcomes or quality of care.","Serna-Gallegos, Tasha; Ninivaggio, Cara S",Current opinion in obstetrics & gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1097/gco.0000000000000662; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32889970/,326

SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV recognize angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor via the receptor-binding domain (RBD). Here, we identified six SARS-CoV RBD-specific neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (nAbs) that cross-reacted with SARS-CoV-2 RBD, two of which, 18F3 and 7B11, neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection. 18F3 recognized conserved epitopes on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, whereas 7B11 recognized epitopes on SARS-CoV RBD not fully conserved in SARS-CoV-2 RBD. The 18F3-recognizing epitopes on RBD did not overlap with the ACE2-binding sites, whereas those recognized by 7B11 were close to the ACE2-binding sites, explaining why 7B11 could, but 18F3 could not, block SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding to ACE2 receptor.

141785,Improving the primary care learning experience for medical students in the wake of COVID-19.,2020-10-28,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread all around the world in a very short period of time. Recent data are showing significant prevalence of arterial hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) among patients with COVID-19, which raised many questions about higher susceptibility of patients with these comorbidities to the novel coronavirus, as well as the role of hypertension and CVD in progression and the prognosis of COVID-19 patients. There is a very limited amount of data, usually obtained from a small population, regarding the effect of the underlying disease on the outcome in patients with COVID-19. The evaluation of the treatment of these comorbidities at baseline and during COVID-19 is scarce and the results are conflicting. Hypertension and CVD, after the adjustment for other clinical and demographic parameters, primarily age, did not remain independent predictors of the lethal outcome in COVID-19 patients. Some investigations speculated about the association between the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and susceptibility to COVID-19, as well as the relationship between RAAS inhibitors and the adverse outcome in these patients. Withdrawing or switching RAAS inhibitors would have uncertain benefits, but it would definitely have many disadvantages such as uncontrolled hypertension, cardiac function deterioration and renal function impairment, which could potentially induce more complications in patients with COVID-19 than the infection of coronavirus itself. The aim of this review article was to summarize the prevalence of hypertension and CVD in patients with COVID-19, their influence on the outcome and the effect of treatment of hypertension and CVD in COVID-19 patients.","Tadic, Marijana; Cuspidi, Cesare; Mancia, Giuseppe; Dell'Oro, Raffaella; Grassi, Guido",Pharmacological research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.104906; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32461198/,326

Our goals were to document how MSC research has been used to address EIDs in Asia, and to explore how MSC approaches align with current priorities for EID research in Asia. We gathered priorities for EID research from the peer-reviewed and grey literature, documented organizational descriptions of MCS research approaches, and analysed a series of EID MSC projects. We found that priority areas for EID research in Asia included (1) understanding host-pathogen-environment interactions; (2) improving tools and technologies; (3) changing people's behaviour; and (4) evaluating the effectiveness of interventions. We found that the unifying characteristics of MSC research were that it was action-oriented and sought to inspire change under real-world conditions at the complex interface of human and natural systems. We suggest that MSC research can be considered a type of 'pragmatic research' and might be most useful in describing change in complex human-animal-environmental systems, accelerating research-to-action, and evaluating effectiveness of interventions in 'real world' settings.","Burns, Theresa E; Stephen, Craig",EcoHealth,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10393-015-1072-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26582581/,326

The aim of this work was to define and apply a method for imaging and quantifying fibrin in thrombi formed into the side holes of CVCs. METHODS Forty-three CVCs removed from a cohort of dialyzed patients were analyzed in this pilot study. Hematoxylin and eosin and a modified Carstair's staining were applied on permanent thrombus sections. Fluorescence microscopy and image analysis were performed to quantify the fibrin amount. RESULTS Highly fluorescent areas were invariably associated with fibrin by Carstair's method. The deposition of concentric layers of fibrin and erythrocytes was easily identified by fluorescence microscopy, showing growth features of the thrombus. Fibrin amount in diabetic patients was significantly higher than that in nondiabetic patients with median (interquartile range) values of 51% (47-68%) and 44% (30-54%), respectively (p=0.032). No significant difference in fibrin content was found by grouping data according to catheter type, permanence time, insertion site and dialysis vintage. Higher variability in fibrin values was found in thrombi from CVCs removed after 1-15 days compared with 16-60 days. A trend of an increase in fibrin amount in thrombi was noted according to blood platelet count at CVC insertion. CONCLUSIONS The analytical method presented here proved to be a rapid and effective way for quantifying fibrin content in thrombi formed on CVCs with potential application in future clinical studies.","Lucas, Thabata Coaglio; Tessarolo, Francesco; Veniero, Patrizia; D'Amato, Elvira; Caola, Iole; Nollo, Giandomenico; Huebner, Rudolf; Brunori, Giuliano",The journal of vascular access,https://doi.org/10.5301/jva.5000200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24474517/,326

In this study, we further characterized the in vitro antiviral efficacies and specificities of these agents. The 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) of each against influenza A was found to be in the high nanomolar range, and the selectivity index (SI = 50% cytotoxic concentration [CC(50)]/EC(50)) was determined to be >324 for AG879 and 50 for A9, indicating that therapeutically useful concentrations of each drug produce only low levels of cytotoxicity. Each compound showed efficacy against representative laboratory strains of both human influenza A (H1N1 or H3N2) and influenza B viruses. Importantly, no drug-resistant influenza virus strains emerged even after 25 viral passages in the presence of AG879, whereas viruses resistant to amantadine appeared after only 3 passages. AG879 and A9 each also exhibited potent inhibitory activity against a variety of other RNA and DNA viruses, including Sendai virus (Paramyxoviridae), herpes simplex virus (Herpesviridae), mouse hepatitis virus (Coronaviridae), and rhesus rotavirus (Reoviridae), but not against Pichinde virus (Arenaviridae). These results together suggest that RTKIs may be useful as therapeutics against viral pathogens, including but not limited to influenza, due to their high selectivity indices, low frequency of drug resistance, and broad-spectrum antiviral activities.","Kumar, Naveen; Sharma, Nishi R; Ly, Hinh; Parslow, Tristram G; Liang, Yuying",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.00725-11; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21930873/,326

Two of the MAbs are specific for the CD4-binding site region and one for the V3 loop. MAb ICR39.13g (CD4-binding site region-specific; IgG2b) effected PAN efficiently at temperatures from 4 to 35 degree C. MAb ICR41.1i (V3 loop-specific; IgG2c) effected PAN only at temperatures of 24 degree C and below. This suggests that its V3 epitope is masked by a change in gp 120 which occurs at temperatures > or = 26 degree C, or that the virion function which is inhibited by ICR41.1i and is responsible for neutralization has already operated at > or = 26 degree C. Resistance to neutralization by ICR41.1i occurred within 20 min of shifting the temperature up to 35 degree C. Finally, MAb ICR39.3b (CD4-binding site region-specific; IgG2b) did not give PAN at any temperature, indicating that neutralization can only occur if this MAb binds virus before it attaches to the cell. Thus, these studies identify at least one novel fusion-independent event, the neutralization target of a V3 MAb, which occurs very early in the initial stages of virus-cell interaction.","Armstrong, S J; Dimmock, N J",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8757979/,326

213642,Development of a Child and Adolescent Tele-Partial Hospitalization Program (tele-PHP) in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"The cytokine storm is an abnormal production of inflammatory cytokines, due to the over-activation of the innate immune response. This mechanism has been recognized as a critical mediator of influenza-induced lung disease, and it could be pivotal for COVID-19 infections. Thus, an immunomodulatory approach targeting the over-production of cytokines could be proposed for viral aggressive pulmonary disease treatment. In this regard, the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-Î³, a member of the PPAR transcription factor family, could represent a potential target. Beside the well-known regulatory role on lipid and glucose metabolism, PPAR-Î³ also represses the inflammatory process. Similarly, the PPAR-Î³ agonist thiazolidinediones (TZDs), like pioglitazone, are anti-inflammatory drugs with ameliorating effects on severe viral pneumonia. In addition to the pharmacological agonists, also nutritional ligands of PPAR-Î³, like curcuma, lemongrass, and pomegranate, possess anti-inflammatory properties through PPAR-Î³ activation. Here, we review the main synthetic and nutritional PPAR-Î³ ligands, proposing a dual approach based on the strengthening of the immune system using pharmacological and dietary strategies as an attempt to prevent/treat cytokine storm in the case of coronavirus infection.","Ciavarella, Carmen; Motta, Ilenia; Valente, Sabrina; Pasquinelli, Gianandrea",Molecules (Basel),,326

220252,Use of Pharmacologic Agents With Weight Gain Potential for Panic Disorder Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"This paper offers a parsimonious, rational-choice model to study the effect of pre-existing inequalities on the transmission of COVID-19. Agents decide whether to ""go out"" (or self-quarantine) and, if so, whether to wear protection such as masks. Three elements distinguish the model from existing work. First, non-symptomatic agents do not know if they are infected. Second, some of these agents unknowingly transmit infections. Third, we permit two-sided prevention via the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions: the probability of a person catching the virus from another depends on protection choices made by each. We find that a mean-preserving increase in pre-existing income inequality unambiguously increases the equilibrium proportion of unprotected, socializing agents and may increase or decrease the proportion who self-quarantine. Strikingly, while higher pre-COVID inequality may or may not raise the overall risk of infection, it increases the risk of disease in social interactions.","Bhattacharya, Joydeep; Chakraborty, Shankha; Yu, Xiumei",J Math Econ,,326

We present the case of a pregnant patient who developed respiratory failure due to COVID-19 and rapidly decompensated requiring intubation. Despite mechanical ventilation, the patient's respiratory status continued to worsen. At bedside, cardiothoracic surgeons, obstetricians, intensivists, and neonatologists discussed balancing the risk of COVID-19 and respiratory failure to the patient, premature delivery to the neonate, potential coagulopathy associated with COVID-19, and the need for anticoagulation with mechanical circulatory support. Ultimately, the decision was to proceed with emergency cesarean section delivery in the intensive care unit followed by peri-partum veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation initiation. The patient and neonate were both discharged home in stable condition.","Rushakoff, Joshua A; Polyak, Alexander; Caron, Jayne; Parrinella, Kristin; Salabat, Reza; Wong, Melissa; Emerson, Dominic",J. card. surg,,326

We find that social capital differentials in COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations depend on the dimension of social capital and the timeframe considered. Communities with higher levels of relational and cognitive social capital were especially successful in lowering COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations than communities with lower social capital between late March and early April. A difference of one standard deviation in relational social capital corresponded to a reduction of 30% in the number of COVID-19 deaths recorded. After April 2020, differentials in COVID-19 deaths related to relational social capital persisted although they became progressively less pronounced. By contrast, the period of March-April 2020, our estimates suggest that there was no statistically significant difference in the number of deaths recorded in areas with different levels of cognitive social capital. In fact, from late June-early July onwards the number of new deaths recorded as being due to COVID-19 was higher in communities with higher levels of cognitive social capital. The overall number of deaths recorded between January 2020 and January 2021 was lower in communities with higher levels of relational social capital. Our findings suggest that the association between social capital and public health outcomes can vary greatly over time and across indicators of social capital.","Borgonovi, Francesca; Andrieu, Elodie; Subramanian, S V",Soc Sci Med,,326

The determination of total filtration efficiency according to DIN EN 149/DIN EN 13274-7 (European standard for FFP1, FFP2 and FFP3 masks) has several drawbacks, making reliable certification of filtering-face-pieces difficult. This note analyses two of these drawbacks, namely the ambiguous definition of the total filtration efficiency and the broad range of the test aerosol particle size distributions allowed. The range of total filtration efficiency values for individual masks resulting from rather wide or missing specifications in the standard is calculated using size resolved penetration curves of 11 FFP2 masks from literature and 11 FFP2 masks from own measurements. From the 22 FFP2 masks regarded in this analysis, two would either pass or fail certification in dependence of the applied definition of the total filtration efficiency and the test aerosol applied.","Zoller, Julian Meyer Jörg Dittler Achim",Journal of Aerosol Science,,326

230011,COVID-19 and Infection Control: A Perspective From the Psychiatric Ward,2020,"Emission benefits of transit buses depend on ridership. Declines in ridership caused by COVID-19 leads uncertainty about the emission reduction capacity of buses. This paper provides a method framework for analyzing spatio-temporal emission patterns of buses in combination with real-time ridership and potential emission changes in the post-COVID-19 future. Based on GPS trajectory and Smart Card data of 2056 buses from 278 routes covering 1.5 million ridership in Qingdao, China, spatio-temporal emissions characteristics of buses are studied. 7589 taxis with 0.2 million passengers' trips are used for acquiring private cars' emissions to evaluate the emissions difference between buses and cars. Empirical results show that the average difference between buses and cars with 2 persons can reach up to 117 g/km-person during 7:00-8:59 and 115 g/km-person during 17:00-18:59. However, buses have various emission benefits around the city at different periods. A double increase in emissions during non-rush hours can be observed compared with rush hours. 224 online survey data are used to study the potential ridership reduction trend in post-COVID-19. Results show that 56.3% of respondents would decrease the usage of buses in the post-COVID-19 future. Based on this figure, our analysis shows that per kilometer-person emissions of buses are higher than cars during non-rush hours, however, still lower than cars during rush hours. We conclude that when ridership reduces by more than 40%, buses cannot be ""greener"" travel modal than cars as before. Finally, several feasible policies are suggested for this potential challenge. Our study provides convincing evidence for understanding the emission patterns of buses, to support better buses investment decisions and promotion on eco-friendly public transport service in the post-COVID-19 future.","Sui, Yi; Zhang, Haoran; Shang, Wenlong; Sun, Rencheng; Wang, Changying; Ji, Jun; Song, Xuan; Shao, Fengjing",Appl Energy,,326

When comparing vaccination rates among quintiles of CCVI scores, Theme 3 (housing type, transportation, household composition, and disability) was associated with the largest disparity, with the least vulnerable counties (Q1) having 33% higher rates of vaccination among individuals aged 18+ (53.5% vs 40.2%) compared to counties with the highest vulnerability (Q5). Using generalized linear models with binomial distributions and log links, we found that a 10-point increase in the CCVI index, socioeconomic vulnerability, housing type and composition, and epidemiological factors were associated with at least a 1.0 percentage point decline in county-level vaccination. The association between community vulnerability and lower vaccination rates suggests the need for continued efforts for equitable COVID-19 vaccination across marginalized communities.","Brown, Clare C; Young, Sean G; Pro, George C",Vaccine,,326
235197,"Racial and Ethnic Differences in COVID-19 Outcomes, Stressors, Fear, and Prevention Behaviors Among US Women: Web-Based Cross-sectional Study",2021,"OBJECTIVES: This study explored the factors influencing health behaviours during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak in China. The impact of perceived stress and positive perception of interventions on health behaviours in China were assessed using the extended information-motivation-behaviour skills (IMB) model. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey. METHODS: The Questionstar online survey tool was used to construct a structured questionnaire based on the IMB model. Between 14 and 22 February 2020, during the peak of COVID-19 epidemic in China, 2449 participants were recruited by snowball sampling on WeChat and Tencent QQ social media platforms in China. Data were collected through an online questionnaire, and structural equation modelling was performed to evaluate the extended IMB model. RESULTS: Health behaviours were assessed using a scoring system (total score range: 8-40); the average health behaviour score in this study was 34.62 ± 4.44. The term 'health risk stress' refers to the impact that perceived stress has on health, and this was experienced by 39.9% of participants. Only 35.9% of participants answered all seven questions on COVID-19 information correctly. The final model showed that information, motivation, behavioural skills, heath risk stress and positive perception of interventions had significant direct effects on health behaviours. Health behaviours were positively associated with the positive perception of interventions but negatively associated with health risk stress. Behavioural skills had the greatest impact on health behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: In the face of public health emergencies, the extended IMB model has been used as a theoretical framework to construct more effective interventions. The government should pay attention to publicity and guidance, strengthen positive interactions with the public and disclose relevant information in a timely manner to gain trust and to maintain the positive public perception of the interventions. In terms of health education, the government should focus on behavioural skills, promptly rectify ineffective prevention information and raise awareness about the disease to relieve stress and anxiety in the population.","Luo, Y; Yao, L; Zhou, L; Yuan, F; Zhong, X",Public Health,,326

The Love and Sex in the Time of COVID-19 survey was conducted online from April to May, 2020. GBMSM were recruited through advertisements featured on social networking platforms, recruiting a sample size of 518 GBMSM. Analysis considers changes three in self-reported measures of sexual behavior: number of sex partners, number of anal sex partners and number of anal sex partners not protected by pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) or condoms. Approximately two-thirds of the sample reported that they believed it was possible to contract COVID-19 through sex, with anal sex reported as the least risky sex act. Men did not generally feel it was important to reduce their number of sex partners during COVID-19, but reported a moderate willingness to have sex during COVID-19. For the period between February and April-May 20,202, participants reported a mean increase of 2.3 sex partners during COVID-19, a mean increase of 2.1 anal sex partners (range - 40 to 70), but a very small increase in the number of unprotected anal sex partners. Increases in sexual behavior during COVID-19 were associated with increases in substance use during the same period. High levels of sexual activity continue to be reported during the COVID-19 lockdown period and these high levels of sexual activity are often paralleled by increases in substance use and binge drinking. There is a clear need to continue to provide comprehensive HIV prevention and care services during COVID-19, and telehealth and other eHealth platforms provide a safe, flexible mechanism for providing services.","Stephenson, Rob; Chavanduka, Tanaka M D; Rosso, Matthew T; Sullivan, Stephen P; Pitter, Renée A; Hunter, Alexis S; Rogers, Erin",AIDS behav,,326

Central to a tertiary paediatric institution's (The Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne (RCH) response was a digital health approach comprising a broad suite of informatics and technology solutions including optimising a fully integrated electronic medical record (EMR). METHODS: This comprehensive approach spanned all patient care areas and encompassed a broad range of hospital operations. They included patient triage, registration, COVID-19 screening clinic operations, electronic ordering, prescribing and documentation, telehealth, reporting and analytics and research. DISCUSSION: This paper outlines key aspects of our COVID-19 digital health strategy, highlighting the rapid transition to telehealth and the development of a remote ""virtual telehealth"" strategy for clinicians which proved popular and allowed true ""working from home"". CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has inadvertently focussed the spotlight on the utility of digital health for clinical care. The speed and uptake of digital health within this pandemic has been remarkable and unprecedented in both an Australian and global setting. Whilst many of these changes have been beneficial, some may have been rushed or forced with minimal consideration of ongoing governance. Key stakeholders and enablers should be identified for post-pandemic consideration in future digital health implementation and adoption strategies.","Cheng, Daryl R; Coote, Andrew; South, Mike",Int J Med Inform,,326

The responsible virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and causes the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is mainly characterized by fever, cough and shortness of breath. In severe cases, the disease can lead to respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock, which are mostly fatal for the patient. The severity of disease progression was hypothesized to be related to an overshooting immune response and was correlated with age and comorbidities, including cancer. A lot of research has lately been focused on the pathogenesis and acute consequences of COVID-19. However, the possibility of longterm consequences caused by viral infections which has been shown for other viruses are not to be neglected. In this regard, this opinion discusses the interplay of SARS-CoV-2 infection and cancer with special focus on the inflammatory immune response and tissue damage caused by infection. We summarize the available literature on COVID-19 suggesting an increased risk for severe disease progression in cancer patients, and we discuss the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 could contribute to cancer development.

METHODS: Data were gathered on the number of dependent older patients treated, emergency treatment provided and the revenues generated by a specialised clinic for geriatric dentistry during the current pandemic period and compared with the recorded clinical activity from the preceding year. Hypothetical projections were generated for the remainder of the current year based on the assumption that restrictions due to COVID-19 would remain. RESULTS: A significant decrease in the total number of dependent older patients treated was recorded during the periods of January-March 2020 (P = .026) and April-May 2020 (P = .001) when compared to 2019. According to projections, by December 2020 the clinic will be providing 81.14% less clinical activity compared to 2019 (P < .0001), including a complete cessation of domiciliary services. Despite decreases in expenditure, revenues generated by the clinic have decreased significantly due to reduced clinical activity during January-March 2020 (P = .268) and April-May 2020 (P = .010) compared to 2019, and would decline further by 899.61% by December 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The restrictions implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in a significant reduction in oral healthcare provision for dependent older adults. Within this clinic, dedicated to dependent older adults, clinical activity is projected to reduce by 81% by the end of 2020 with associated reductions in revenue generation.

276505,Staff Morale and Well-Being During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Panax ginseng extract (GS-KG9) in the treatment of hepatic dysfunction. Methods: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted from December 2017 to January 2019. The trial included 60 subjects between the ages of 19 and 70 who had higher alanine transaminase (ALT) levels than the normal upper limit. The subjects were randomly divided into two groups: GS-KG9 (n = 30) and placebo (n = 30). The former was administered three GS-KG9 capsules (3 g/day) and the latter three placebo capsules (3 g/day) twice each day orally after meals in the morning and evening for 12 weeks. The primary goal was to observe the changes in ALT and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels. The safety of the treatment was assessed and adverse events (AEs) were recorded. Results: Out of 60 subjects, nine were excluded from the efficacy analysis because they met the exclusion criteria. Therefore, a total of 51 subjects were evaluated for the effectiveness of the treatment (26 in the GS-KG9 group and 25 in the placebo group). After 12 weeks of treatment, the ALT levels were significantly reduced in the GS-KG9 group compared to the placebo group (p=0.009). The GGT level of the GS-KG9 group was significantly lower than that of the placebo group (p=0.036). Mild AEs, such as diarrhea, occurred during the study. There were no significant differences between the two groups. Conclusion: The results of this trial suggest that GS-KG9 might be an effective and safe option for mild hepatic dysfunction. This trial is registered with KCT0004080.","Shen, Lei; Gwak, Si Ra; Joo, Jong Cheon; Song, Bong Keun; Cha, Seon Woo; Song, Young Uk; Pyo, Mi Kyung; Park, Soo Jung",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,,326

This is due to CRISPR's remarkable gene editing and cleaving abilities. While the application of CRISPR in human genome editing and diagnosis needs to be researched more fully, and any potential side effects or ambiguities resolved, CRISPR has already shown its capacity in an astonishing variety of applications related to genome editing and genetic engineering. One of its most currently relevant applications is in diagnosis of infectious and non-infectious diseases. Since its initial discovery, 6 types and 22 subtypes of CRISPR systems have been discovered and explored. Diagnostic CRISPR systems are most often derived from types II, V, and VI. Different types of CRISPR-Cas systems which have been identified in different microorganisms can target DNA (e.g. Cas9 and Cas12 enzymes) or RNA (e.g. Cas13 enzyme). Viral, bacterial, and non-infectious diseases such as cancer can all be diagnosed using the cleavage activity of CRISPR enzymes from the aforementioned types. Diagnostic tests using Cas12 and Cas13 enzymes have already been developed for detection of the emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus. Additionally, CRISPR diagnostic tests can be performed using simple reagents and paper-based lateral flow assays, which can potentially reduce laboratory and patient costs significantly. In this review, the classification of CRISPR-Cas systems as well as the basis of the CRISPR/Cas mechanisms of action will be presented. The application of these systems in medical diagnostics with emphasis on the diagnosis of COVID-19 will be discussed.","Jolany Vangah, Somayeh; Katalani, Camellia; Booneh, Hannah A; Hajizade, Abbas; Sijercic, Adna; Ahmadian, Gholamreza",Biol Proced Online,,326

The literature review revealed 36 articles describing 320 children with Kawasaki-like disease associated with COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was negative in 120 (65.5%) of 183 patients while the serology was positive in 130 (83.8%) of 155 patients. The therapeutic options have included IVIG, acetylsalicylic acid, tocilizumab, anakinra, enoxaparin, and methylprednisolone. Pediatric COVID-19 cases may present with atypical/incomplete Kawasaki-like disease. Thus, pediatricians need to be aware of such atypical presentations resembling KD for early diagnosis of COVID-19.","Akca, Ummusen Kaya; Kesici, Selman; Ozsurekci, Yasemin; Aykan, Hayrettin Hakan; Batu, Ezgi Deniz; Atalay, Erdal; Demir, Selcan; Sag, Erdal; Vuralli, Dogus; Bayrakci, Benan; Bilginer, Yelda; Ozen, Seza",Rheumatol Int,,326
353721,Multiple Sclerosis During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVE: During the past decade, the pediatric suicide rate has nearly tripled. Yet, little is known about suicide behavior (SB) in children. Identification of risk factors associated with SB during childhood may be critical to preventing future attempts. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between neurocognitive performance and suicide ideation (SI) in children. METHOD: The present study utilized baseline data from 11,875 participants in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) study, a longitudinal study that follows 9- and 10-year-old children through late adolescence to examine factors that influence developmental trajectories. Suicidality was assessed by the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorder and Schizophrenia (KSADS) suicide module completed by the parent. Neurocognitive ability was assessed using the NIH Toolbox Cognition measures administered to the youth. RESULTS: Children with a history of SI reported by their parent or concordant parent and youth report of SI demonstrated lower performance on the NIH Toolbox Picture Sequence Memory Test compared to children without SI. The difference in performance on the memory task remained significant when including demographic characteristics, family history of suicide, and internalizing symptoms in the model as covariates. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify decreased episodic memory in children with SI. These findings are similar to results from adult and adolescent studies which have reported decreased memory performance among suicide attempters. Deficits in episodic memory may impact a child's ability to problem-solve and generate potential future outcomes, which may increase the risk for SB. Early identification of memory deficits in children may inform suicide prevention and intervention efforts. Highlights 6% of parents and children reported a history of active suicide ideation in children. Children with a history of suicide ideation had lower episodic memory performance. Early identification of memory deficits may inform suicide intervention efforts.","Huber, Rebekah S; Sheth, Chandni; Renshaw, Perry F; Yurgelun-Todd, Deborah A; McGlade, Erin C",Arch Suicide Res,,326
356381,Impact of Trump's Promotion of Unproven COVID-19 Treatments and Subsequent Internet Trends: Observational Study,2020,"INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Female sexual function is influenced by the emotional and hormonal state. COVID-19 has been the major global health crisis of our time with high psychosocial impact. Vaginismus is a form of female sexual dysfunction and a subset of genitopelvic pain/penetration disorder in which any form of vaginal penetration is painful or impossible. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on sexual function of women treated for vaginismus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All women treated using dilators between 2018-2019 were included. Data obtained 3 months after comfortable penetration and during the pandemic via telephone interview were compared. The Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), Golombok-Rust Inventory of Sexual Satisfaction (GRISS), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used to evaluate sexual function and depression. Frequency of sexual intercourse and pain was compared using a visual analogue scale. RESULTS: Seventy-seven women were included. Mean duration of treatment and number of treatment sessions were 3.5 ± 2.6 months and 4.2 ± 2.6, respectively. There were significant improvements in the FSFI desire, arousal, orgasm, and pain subscales and total score and in the GRISS infrequency, noncommunication, avoidance, non-sensuality, and vaginismus subscales and total score during the pandemic. The GRISS dissatisfaction and anorgasmia subscales and BDI score significantly worsened. Mean frequency of sexual intercourse was 2.3 ± 1.8/week and did not change significantly. Pain scores decreased during the pandemic (2.7 ± 2.8) compared to post-treatment (6.2 ± 2.9). CONCLUSION: Although frequency of sexual intercourse was not affected and pain scores and FSFI total and subscale scores improved, satisfaction and orgasm were adversely affected, which may be attributed to increased stress and anxiety during the pandemic.","Gungor Ugurlucan, Funda; Yasa, Cenk; Ates Tikiz, Muge; Evruke, Ipek; Isik, Cansu; Dural, Ozlem; Akhan, Suleyman Engin",Int. urogynecol. j.

This article proposes a first measure of familiarity with and attitude toward clinical research in France. Drawing from the ""Health Literacy Survey 2019"" (HLS19) conducted online between 27 May and 5 June 2020 on a sample of the French adult population (N = 1003), we show that a significant proportion of the French population claimed some familiarity with clinical trials (64.8%) and had positive attitudes (72%) toward them. One of the important findings of this study is that positive attitudes toward clinical research exist side by side with a strong distancing from the pharmaceutical industry. While respondents acknowledged that the pharmaceutical industry plays an important role in clinical research (68.3%), only one-quarter indicated that they trust the industry (25.7%). Positive attitudes toward clinical trials were associated with familiarity with clinical trials (Odds Ratio, OR 2.97 [1.90-4.63]), financial difficulties (OR 0.63 [0.46-0.85]), as well as mistrust of doctors (0.48 [0.27-0.85]) and of scientists (OR 0.62 [0.38-0.99]). Although the French media provided a great deal of information on how clinical research works during the first months of the pandemic, there remains profound mistrust of the pharmaceutical industry in France. This suspicion can undermine crisis management, especially in the areas of vaccine development and preparation for future pandemics.","Schultz, Émilien; Ward, Jeremy K; Atlani-Duault, Laëtitia; Holmes, Seth M; Mancini, Julien",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,326

381309,Association Between the COVID-19 Outbreak and Mental Health in India: A Google Trends Study,2020,"Many countries have passed their first COVID-19 epidemic peak. Traditional epidemiological models describe this as a result of non-pharmaceutical interventions that pushed the growth rate below the recovery rate. In this new phase of the pandemic many countries show an almost linear growth of confirmed cases for extended time-periods. This new containment regime is hard to explain by traditional models where infection numbers either grow explosively until herd immunity is reached, or the epidemic is completely suppressed (zero new cases). Here we offer an explanation of this puzzling observation based on the structure of contact networks. We show that for any given transmission rate there exists a critical number of social contacts, $D_c$, below which linear growth and low infection prevalence must occur. Above $D_c$ traditional epidemiological dynamics takes place, as e.g. in SIR-type models. When calibrating our corresponding model to empirical estimates of the transmission rate and the number of days being contagious, we find $D_c\sim 7.2$. Assuming realistic contact networks with a degree of about 5, and assuming that lockdown measures would reduce that to household-size (about 2.5), we reproduce actual infection curves with a remarkable precision, without fitting or fine-tuning of parameters. In particular we compare the US and Austria, as examples for one country that initially did not impose measures and one that responded with a severe lockdown early on. Our findings question the applicability of standard compartmental models to describe the COVID-19 containment phase. The probability to observe linear growth in these is practically zero.","Thurner, Stefan; Klimek, Peter; Hanel, Rudolf",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11302v1.pdf,326

These viruses originated from the subfamily Coronavirinae which genetically includes Alphacoronavirus, Beta coronavirus, Gamma coronavirus and Delta coronavirus. The sequencing analysis of the genome showed that COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 belongs to Beta coronavirus genus and avian infectious bronchitis caused by IBV comes from Gamma coronavirus genus. Over the past few decades and until now, the world showed that endemic outbreaks of infectious bronchitis in avian caused by IBV. Once more, the world sees the emergence of another new human coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak due to a new strain called SARS-CoV-2. Whole genetic material and comparative genomic analysis exhibited that IBV and SARS-CoV-2 have particularly same genomic structures and characteristics. Both have a spike protein in the genome structure which allows that SARS-CoV-2 attaches to their human select cells throughout ACE 2receptors, that are notably reported in the lung and kidney. While IBV uses alpha 2,3 linked sialic acids-dependent manner for bind to the avian tissues which is notably reported in the lung and kidney.

Our article aims of comparing and interpreting between-country trends of mortality rate, case-fatality and all-cause excess mortality. METHODS: We used data from open databases (Our World in Data mostly) for comparing mortality of eleven western countries (Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, UK, USA). Between-country trends in mortality rate and case-fatality (both including deaths for COVID-19 as numerator and therefore labelled as COVID-19 mortality metrics) and all-cause excess mortality (i.e. observed deaths during the epidemic compared with those expected based on mortality in the same periods of previous years) were compared. RESULTS: Although Belgium ranks first in mortality from COVID-19 (possibly due to the broadest criterion for attributing a death to COVID-19), it does not rank first for all-cause excess mortality. Conversely, compared with Belgium, the UK, Italy and Spain have reported lower COVID-19 mortality (possibly due to the narrower definitions for a COVID-19 death) but higher all-cause excess mortality. Germany and Austria are the unique countries for which COVID-19 mortality, case-fatality and all-cause excess mortality consistently exhibited the lowest rates. CONCLUSION: Between-country heterogeneity of COVID-19 mortality metrics could be largely explained by differences of criteria for attributing a death to COVID-19; in age/comorbidity structures; in policies for identifying asymptomatic people affected from SARS-CoV-2 infection. All-cause excess mortality is recommended as a more reliable metric for comparing countries.","Corrao, Giovanni; Rea, Federico; Blangiardo, Gian Carlo",J Hypertens,,326

This paper reviews how these four systemic drivers help explain the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and other recent emerging infectious diseases, and the policies that can be adopted to mitigate their risks. Land-use change and meat consumption increase the likelihood of pathogen spillover from animals to people. The risk that such zoonotic outbreaks will then spread to become pandemics is magnified by growing urban populations and the networks of trade and travel within and among countries. Zoonotic spillover can be mitigated through habitat protection and restrictions on the wildlife trade. Containing infectious disease spread requires a high degree of coordination among institutions across geographic jurisdictions and economic sectors, all backed by international investment and cooperation.","Wu, Tong",Ambio,,326

Severe allergic reactions and anaphylaxis after COVID-19 vaccination are very rare adverse events but have drawn attention due to potentially lethal outcomes and have triggered a high degree of uncertainty.MethodsCurrent knowledge on anaphylactic reactions to vaccines and specifically the new mRNA COVID-19 vaccines was compiled using a literature search in Medline, PubMed, as well as the national and international study and guideline registries, the Cochrane Library, and the Internet, with special reference to official websites of the World Health Organization (WHO), US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Robert Koch Institute (RKI), and Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI).ResultsBased on the international literature and previous experience, recommendations for prophylaxis, diagnosis and therapy of these allergic reactions are given by a panel of experts.ConclusionAllergy testing is not necessary for the vast majority of allergic patients prior to COVID-19 vaccination with currently licensed vaccines. In case of allergic/anaphylactic reactions after vaccination, allergy workup is recommended, as it is for a small potential risk population prior to the first vaccination. Evaluation and approval of diagnostic tests should be done for this purpose.","Klimek, Ludger Bergmann Karl-Christian Professor Dr med Brehler Randolf Pfützner Wolfgang Zuberbier Torsten Hartmann Karin Jakob Thilo Novak Natalija Ring Johannes Merk Hans Hamelmann Eckard Ankermann Tobias Schmidt Sebastian Untersmayr Eva Hötzenecker Wolfram Jensen-Jarolim Erika Brockow Knut Mahler Vera Worm Margitta",Allergo Journal International,,326
431941,A Self-Assessment Web-Based App to Assess Trends of the COVID-19 Pandemic in France: Observational Study,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak has been a global pandemic. Researchers have made great efforts to investigate SARS-CoV-2. However, there are few studies analyzing the general situation of SARS-CoV-2 research at global level. This study aimed to characterize global scientific efforts based on SARS-CoV-2 publications. METHODOLOGY: SARS-CoV-2 -related publications were retrieved using Web of Science. The number of publications, citation, country, journal, study topic, total confirmed cases, and total deaths were analyzed. RESULTS: A total of 441 publications were identified. China contributed the largest number of publications (198, 44.90%), followed by USA (51, 11.56%), Italy (28, 6.35%), Germany (19, 4.31%), and South Korea (13, 2.95%). Upper-middle-income economies (51.70%) produced the most SARS-CoV-2 publications, followed by high-income (45.12%), lower-middle-income (2.95%), and low-income economies (0.23%). The research output had a significant correlations with total confirmed cases (r = 0.666, p = 0.000) and total deaths (r = 0.610, p = 0.000). China had the highest total citations (1947), followed by USA (204), and Germany (54). China also had the highest average citations (9.83), followed by Netherlands (5.80), and Canada (5.43). The most popular journals were Journal of Medical Virology, Eurosurveillance, and Emerging Microbes and Infections. The most discussed topic was the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. CONCLUSIONS: Scientific research on SARS-CoV-2 is from worldwide researchers' efforts, with some countries and journals having special contributions. The countries with more total confirmed cases and total deaths tend to have more research output in the field of SARS-CoV-2. China was the most prolific country, and had the highest quality of publications on SARS-CoV-2.","Jia, Zhiwei; Wu, Yaohong; Ding, Fan; Wen, Tianlin",J Infect Dev Ctries,,326

434367,Stressors Occurring in Psychiatry Residents Working in Psychiatric Hospitals During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Background Human species are facing a new crisis. The COVID19 pandemic has not only disrupted the health system of the entire world but has also put tremendous pressure on it. According to the CDC, mucormycosis (previously called zygomycosis) is a serious but rare fungal infection caused by a group of molds called mucormycetes. These molds live throughout the environment. Mucormycosis mainly affects people who have health problems or take medicines that lower the body's ability to fight germs and sickness. It is an aggressive fulminant invasive fungal infection that can occur in patients with diverse precipitating factors such as uncontrolled diabetes, renal failure, organ transplant, long-term corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy, cirrhosis, burns, Acquired ImmunoDeficiency Syndrome and malignancies such as lymphomas and leukemias. Reportings of mucormycosis in covid patients have posed an additional apprehension and an onus on the already struggling government and health care workers. Objective Description of case series of mucormycosis in post COVID19 patients. Materials and Methods Systematic review of various studies reporting presence of mucormycosis in post covid patients was done. The study was conducted to assess the impact of mucormycosis on patients suffering from a virus. While searching keywords ?covid? and ?mucormycosis? on Google Scholar and internet, we found 9 studies which reported 13 post covid patients infected with mucormycosis. Result Mucormycosis can be divided into at least six clinical syndromes: rhino-orbital-cerebral, pulmonary, cutaneous, gastrointestinal, disseminated, and miscellaneous. Analysis of post covid patients showed four clinical manifestations- Rhino-Orbital-Cerebral Disease (3 research papers reporting one case each and 1 research paper with 4 patients);Pulmonary Disease (3 research papers with 4 cases);Gastrointestinal Disease (1 research paper with 1 case) and Disseminated (1 research paper with 1 case). Out of these total thirteen patients, seven were reported dead. S.No. Author Number of Patients Mucormycosis associated Clinical Syndrome Outcome 1.

Although the reported data relating to presence of mucormycosis in Covid patients is very meagre, yet the fatality rate is more than fifty percent. The situation is alarming. Exhaustive studies need to be undertaken as delayed diagnosis and inadequate treatment may lead to higher risk of negative outcomes.","Agarwal, Abhimanyu Puri Inder",The FASEB Journal,,326

Great efforts have been made to find effective medications against the COVID-19. This study aims to compare the effectiveness of LINCOCIN® and AZITRO® in the treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. A total of 24 hospitalized patients aged between 30-80 years who were admitted to the Tarsus Medical Park Hospital between February to March 2020 was included in the study. The patients were divided into LINCOCIN® and AZITRO® treatment groups. Bronchoalveolar-lavage PCR results were compared after treatment. The mean age was 58.4±15.4 years in the LINCOCIN® group and 59.1±16.6 years in the AZITRO® group. In the LINCOCIN® group, the rate of males was 66.7% and it was 58.3% in the AZITRO® group. There were no statistical differences in terms of age and gender between the groups. On the 6th day after starting treatment, negative bronchoalveolar PCR result was 83.3% in the LINCOCIN® group and 33.3% in the AZITRO® group. The negative bronchoalveolar PCR proportion was significantly higher in the LINCOCIN® group than in the AZITRO® group. LINCOCIN® usage may be more appropriate in the treatment of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. Further studies with a large sample size should clarify these results.","Guvenmez, Oguz; Keskin, Hüseyin; Ay, Burak; Birinci, Suayip; Kanca, Muhammed Furkan",J Popul Ther Clin Pharmacol,,326

440560,Changes in Language Style and Topics in an Online Eating Disorder Community at the Beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Observational Study,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to unprecedented levels of unemployment and financial strain for many Americans. Among the individuals impacted by financial strain are pregnant women, for whom added financial stress may be particularly impactful due to the costs associated with prenatal care and providing for a newborn. Financial stress has been previously associated with elevated depression symptoms among pregnant women, which could have significant impacts on birth outcomes and long-term offspring health. However, the impacts of COVID-19-associated financial stress on maternal depression in pregnancy has not been investigated. METHODS: Here, we evaluated whether COVID-19-associated financial stress was associated with increased likelihood of a clinically significant depression score (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Score &#8805; 15) among pregnant women living in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data come from an online survey administered to a convenience sample in April 2020 (N = 2099). RESULTS: Forty-three percent of participants reported experiencing financial stress as a result of the pandemic, while 24% of participants had a clinically significant depression score. COVID-19-related financial stress was significantly associated with increased likelihood of a clinically significant depression score, even after adjustment for covariates including participant education and income (adjusted Odds Ratio: 2.23, 95% CI = 1.80, 2.77, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Financial stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with more than two times the likelihood of depression during pregnancy, which could impact birth outcomes and long-term offspring health.","Thayer, Zaneta M; Gildner, Theresa E",Am J Hum Biol,,326

This impedes global research cooperation, which is essential for tackling public health emergencies and requires unimpeded access to data, analysis tools, and computational infrastructure. Here, we show that community efforts in developing open analytical software tools over the past 10 years, combined with national investments into scientific computational infrastructure, can overcome these deficiencies and provide an accessible platform for tackling global health emergencies in an open and transparent manner. Specifically, we use all SARS-CoV-2 genomic data available in the public domain so far to (1) underscore the importance of access to raw data and (2) demonstrate that existing community efforts in curation and deployment of biomedical software can reliably support rapid, reproducible research during global health crises.

The April 24, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC) has confirmed more than 39,000 cases, including >1800 deaths. California's Governor Gavin Newsom ordered mandatory stay at home after World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic in early March. We have evaluated the correlation between environmental pollution determinants and the COVID-19 outbreak in California by using the secondary published data from the Centers for Disease Control and the Environmental Pollution Agency (EPA). We employed Spearman and Kendall correlation tests to analyze the association of PM 2.5, PM 10, SO2, NO2, Pb, VOC, and CO with COVID-19 cases in California. Our findings indicate that environmental pollutants such as PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, and CO have a significant correlation with the COVID-19 epidemic in California. Overall, our study is a useful supplement to encourage regulatory bodies to promote changes in environmental policies as pollution source control can reduce the harmful effects of environmental pollutants.","Bashir, Muhammad Farhan; Ma, Ben Jiang; Komal, Bushra; Bashir, Muhammad Adnan; Farooq, Taimoor Hassan; Iqbal, Najaf; Bashir, Madiha",Environ Res,,326
466940,"Antecedents of Individuals' Concerns Regarding Hospital Hygiene and Surgery Postponement During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional, Web-Based Survey Study",2021,"COVID-19 represents the most severe global crisis to date whose public conversation can be studied in real time. To do so, we use a data set of over 350 million tweets and retweets posted by over 26 million English speaking Twitter users from January 13 to June 7, 2020. We characterize the retweet network to identify spontaneous clustering of users and the evolution of their interaction over time in relation to the pandemic's emergence. We identify several stable clusters (super-communities), and are able to link them to international groups mainly involved in science and health topics, national elites, and political actors. The science- and health-related super-community received disproportionate attention early on during the pandemic, and was leading the discussion at the time. However, as the pandemic unfolded, the attention shifted towards both national elites and political actors, paralleled by the introduction of country-specific containment measures and the growing politicization of the debate. Scientific super-community remained present in the discussion, but experienced less reach and became more isolated within the network. Overall, the emerging network communities are characterized by an increased self-amplification and polarization. This makes it generally harder for information from international health organizations or scientific authorities to directly reach a broad audience through Twitter for prolonged time. These results may have implications for information dissemination along the unfolding of long-term events like epidemic diseases on a world-wide scale.","Durazzi, Francesco; Muller, Martin; Salath'e, Marcel; Remondini, Daniel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.06845v2.pdf,326

There are rigorous containment measures on industries, non-essential business, transportation, and citizen mobility to check the spread. The lockdowns may have an advantageous impact on reducing the atmospheric pollutants. This study has analyzed the change in atmospheric pollutants, based on the Sentinel-5Ps and ground-station observed data during partial to complete lockdown period in 2020. Results revealed that the mean tropospheric NO2 concentration substantially dropped in 2020 due to lockdown against the same period in 2019 by 18-40% over the major urban areas located in Europe (i.e. Madrid, Milan, Paris) and the USA (i.e. New York, Boston, and Springfield). Conversely, urban areas with partial to no lockdown measures (i.e. Warsaw, Pierre, Bismarck, and Lincoln) exhibited a relatively lower dropdown in mean NO2 concentration (3 to 7.5%). The role of meteorological variability was found to be negligible. Nevertheless, the reduced levels of atmospheric pollutants were primarily attributed to the shutdown of vehicles, power plants, and industrial emissions. Improvement in air quality during COVID-19 may be temporary, but regulatory bodies should learn to reduce air pollution on a long-term basis concerning the trade-offs between the environment, society, and economic growth. The intersection of urban design, health, and environment should be addressed by policy-makers to protect public health and sustainable urban policies could be adopted to build urban resilience against any future emergencies.","Bar, Somnath; Parida, Bikash Ranjan; Mandal, Shyama Prasad; Pandey, Arvind Chandra; Kumar, Navneet; Mishra, Bibhudatta",Cities,,326

469833,Problem Gambling During the COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"Sentinel surveillance of acute hospitalisations in response to infectious disease emergencies such as the 2009 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic is well described, but recognition of its potential to supplement routine public health surveillance and provide scalability for emergency responses has been limited. We summarise the achievements of two national paediatric hospital surveillance networks relevant to vaccine programmes and emerging infectious diseases in Canada (Canadian Immunization Monitoring Program Active; IMPACT from 1991) and Australia (Paediatric Active Enhanced Disease Surveillance; PAEDS from 2007) and discuss opportunities and challenges in applying their model to other contexts. Both networks were established to enhance capacity to measure vaccine preventable disease burden, vaccine programme impact, and safety, with their scope occasionally being increased with emerging infectious diseases' surveillance. Their active surveillance has increased data accuracy and utility for syndromic conditions (e.g. encephalitis), pathogen-specific diseases (e.g. pertussis, rotavirus, influenza), and adverse events following immunisation (e.g. febrile seizure), enabled correlation of biological specimens with clinical context and supported responses to emerging infections (e.g. pandemic influenza, parechovirus, COVID-19). The demonstrated long-term value of continuous, rather than incident-related, operation of these networks in strengthening routine surveillance, bridging research gaps, and providing scalable public health response, supports their applicability to other countries.","Top, Karina A; Macartney, Kristine; Bettinger, Julie A; Tan, Ben; Blyth, Christopher C; Marshall, Helen S; Vaudry, Wendy; Halperin, Scott A; McIntyre, Peter",Euro surveill,,326

However, they seldom receive palliative care with the burden of support falling to hostel staff. AIM: To evaluate a model embedding palliative specialists, trained as 'homelessness champions', into hostels for two half-days a month to provide support to staff and residents and facilitate a multidisciplinary approach to care. DESIGN: An exploratory qualitative design. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Four homeless hostels in London, UK, including nine hostel managers/support staff and seven palliative care specialists (five nurses and two social workers). RESULTS: Benefits to introducing the model included: developing partnership working between hostel staff and palliative care specialists, developing a holistic palliative ethos within the hostels and improving how hostel staff seek support and connect with local external services. Challenges to implementation included limited time and resources, and barriers related to primary care. CONCLUSION: This is the first evaluation of embedding palliative care specialists within homeless hostels. Inequity in health and social care access was highlighted with evidence of benefit of this additional support for both hostel staff and residents. Considering COVID-19, future research should explore remote ways of working including providing in-reach support to homelessness services from a range of services and organisations.","Armstrong, Megan; Shulman, Caroline; Hudson, Briony; Brophy, Niamh; Daley, Julian; Hewett, Nigel; Stone, Patrick",Palliat Med,,326

METHODS: Various machine learning techniques: Decision Trees, Linear Regression, and Random Forest have been applied to correlate air pollutants and COVID-19 fatalities in Delhi. Furthermore, a comparison between the concentration of various air pollutants and the air quality index during the lockdown period and last two years, 2018 and 2019, has been presented. RESULTS: From the experimental work, it has been observed that the pollutants ozone and toluene have increased during the lockdown period. It has also been deduced that the pollutants that may impact the mortalities due to COVID-19 are ozone, NH3, NO2, and PM10. CONCLUSIONS: The novel coronavirus has led to environmental restoration due to lockdown. However, there is a need to impose measures to control ozone pollution, as there has been a significant increase in its concentration and it also impacts the COVID-19 mortality rate.","Sethi, Jasleen Kaur; Mittal, Mamta",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,326

504959,Foreseeing a worsening of pediatric malnutrition following SARS-CoV-2 in low and middle-income countries such as Pakistan,2020,"COVID-19 is a type of an infectious disease that is caused by the new coronavirus. The spread of COVID-19 needs to be suppressed because COVID-19 can cause death, especially for sufferers with congenital diseases and a weak immune system. COVID-19 spreads through direct contact, wherein the infected individual spreads the COVID-19 virus through cough, sneeze, or close contacts. Predicting the number of COVID-19 sufferers becomes an important task in the effort to curb the spread of COVID-19. Artificial neural network (ANN) is the prediction method that delivers effective results in doing this job. Backpropagation, a type of ANN algorithm, offers predictive problem solving with good performance. However, its performance depends on the optimization method applied during the training process. In general, the optimization method in ANN is the gradient descent method, which is known to have a slow convergence rate. Meanwhile, the Fletcher-Reeves method has a faster convergence rate than the gradient descent method. Based on this hypothesis, this paper proposes a prediction model for the number of COVID-19 sufferers in Malang using the Backpropagation neural network with the Fletcher-Reeves method. The experimental results show that the Backpropagation neural network with the Fletcher-Reeves method has a better performance than the Backpropagation neural network with the gradient descent method. This is shown by the Means Square Error (MSE) resulting from the proposed method which is smaller than the MSE resulting from the Backpropagation neural network with the gradient descent method. © 2021 Syaiful Anam et al.","Anam, S.; Maulana, M.

The statement certainly feels like a warning, but it is a warning that comes with a prescription that carries optimism and hope The warning that the virus will “take on the world” has indeed been the world’s experience during the first year of COVID-19 But the warning is more ominous with the continual emergence of variants of the coronavirus that have differing characteristics – transmission speed, pathogenicity, evasion of immunity to prior infection or immunization (1) Viruses do not have wants or desires;viruses do not have goals or objectives;and viruses do not have plans for the future However, viruses are in the realm of the living, they do replicate (with the host’s machinery), and they evolve in directions that favor their continued existence As long as their continued existence threatens human health, they are taking on the world Why should the world’s sharing of vaccines be part of the solution? What contribution can COVID-19 vaccines make? How confident should we be in the ability of vaccines to stop these viruses? Virus evolution is dependent on mutations that arise during replication in a host that are transmitted to others, creating subtly and sometime not-so-subtly different lineages that can have selective advantage Stopping replication stops evolution Preventing infection prevents replication Preventing transmission prevents infection To the extent that vaccines are able to decrease the amount of viral replication, viral infection, and viral transmission, the pace of evolution should be able to be slowed, slowing generation of variants, and slowing the virus’ taking on of the world Can vaccines do that? The current COVID-19 vaccines have been authorized for use based on their proven ability to prevent clinical disease, not their ability to prevent transmission and infection However, animal models in preclinical trials showed evidence of prevention of transmission, and evidence is emerging that COVID-19 vaccines prevent infection and transmission Seeing the large decreases of COVID-19 with widespread use of COVID-19 vaccine in Israel is a good sign with real world evidence (2) We are likely to see more and more evidence that COVID-19 vaccines prevent infection and transmission as the world has more experience with the vaccines Based on other routinely-used vaccines, one would expect the COVID-19 vaccines to have some effectiveness against infection and transmission Look at hepatitis A in China The number of infections is hundreds of times lower than in the pre-vaccine era after use of hepatitis A vaccines;fewer infections mean fewer replications Even inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), which is often said to not be effective against infection/transmission, has epidemiologically meaningful effectiveness against infection/transmission (3) Several European countries eliminated polioviruses with IPV alone Last year, China stopped a three-year-old outbreak of circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus type 2 with Sabin-strain IPV alone (4) These accomplishments would not have been possible without vaccine effectiveness against infection/transmission Will vaccines cause selection of vaccine-escape mutants? One would expect that viruses less neutralized by vaccines to have selective advantage over viruses more susceptible to vaccine-induced immunity However, this is not a reason to not vaccinate The contribution of selection pressure leading to meaningful vaccine escape is not known Every year, influenza vaccine is changed in attempt to match the upcoming circulating strains, but the reason that circulating strains change is not from vaccine selection pressure, but rather from genetic drift that happens with or without vaccination Virus replication anywhere is a threat everywhere Not only is ongoing transmission a risk to health where it is happening, but also a risk to other places to which the virus can travel This is in part the reason for the World Health Organization’s (WHO) call for solidarity in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic Along with promoting the development of COVID-19 vaccines, WHO, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness, and Gavi created COVAX, a mechanism for sharing vaccines globally Almost all countries of the world have signed onto COVAX, and indeed COVAX has already started sharing COVID-19 vaccines (5) Strengthening COVAX with financing and vaccine supports sharing the vaccine with the world As George Gao says, sharing vaccines with the world is important to prevent the virus from taking on the world Vaccines alone, of course, are not enough Constant vigilance and sensitive surveillance of circulating coronavirus is absolutely essential The first generation of vaccines may need to be updated to keep up with, and ideally get ahead of virus evolution by finding additional vaccine targets Population immunity will need to be frequently assessed against circulating strains and tested for waning immunity Vaccination policies will need to be adjusted as the epidemiology changes Ensuring availability and large-scale use of COVID-19 vaccines by all countries, in solidarity against the COVID-19 pandemic, is a vital strategy to prevent the virus from taking on the world","Zundong, Yin Lance Rodewald Dan Wu",China CDC Weekly,,326
506541,"Social Capital-Accrual, Escape-From-Self, and Time-Displacement Effects of Internet Use During the COVID-19 Stay-at-Home Period: Prospective, Quantitative Survey Study",2020,"Many viral proteins, including multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins, are secreted via the endoplasmic reticulum, and viral particles are assembled and exported in ER-associated replication compartments. Viral coat proteins such as the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein are N-glycosylated at NxS/T sites as they enter the ER. N-glycosylated sites in many eukaryotic proteins are deglycosylated by the NGLY1/PNG-1 deglycosylation enzyme which also deamidates the N-glycosylated asparagine to aspartic acid, thus editing the target protein sequence. Proteomic analysis of mammalian cell lines has revealed deamidation of many host N-glycosylated asparagines to aspartic acid by NGLY1/PNG-1 on peptides that are presented by mammalian HLA for immune surveillance. The key client protein for NGLY1/PNG-1 deglycosylation and N to D protein editing was revealed by genetic analysis of C. elegans proteasome regulation to be the intact endoplasmic reticulum-transiting SKN-1A transcription factor. Strikingly, an analysis of cancer cell genetic dependencies for growth revealed that the mammalian orthologue of SKN-1A, NRF1 (also called NFE2L1) is required by a highly correlated set of cell lines as NGLY1/PNG-1, supporting that NGLY1/PNG-1 and NRF1 act in the same pathway. NGLY1/PNG-1 edits N-glycosylated asparagines on the intact SKN-1 protein as it is retrieved by ERAD from the ER to in turn activate the transcription of target proteasomal genes. The normal requirement for NGLY1/PNG-1 editing of SKN-1A can be bypassed by a genomic substituion of N to D in four NxS/T N-glycosylation motifs of SKN-1A. Thus NGLY1/PNG-1-mediated N to D protein editing is more than a degradation step for the key client protein for proteasomal homeostasis in C. elegans or tumor growth in particular mammalian cell lines, SKN-1A/NRF1. In addition, such N to D substitutions in NxS/T N-glycosylation motifs occur in evolution: N to D substitutions are observed in phylogenetic comparisons of SKN-1A between nematode species that diverged hundreds of millions of years ago or of the vertebrate NRF1 between disparate vertebrates. Genomic N to D mutations bypass the many steps in N-glycosylation in the ER and deglycosylation-based editing of N to D, perhaps based on differences in the competency of divergent species for various N-glycosylation or deglycosylation steps. We surveyed the N-glycosylation sites in coronavirus proteins for such phylogenetic evidence for N to D protein editing in viral life cycles, and found evidence for preferential N to D residue substitutions in NxS/T N-glycosylation sites in comparisons of the genome sequences of hundreds of coronaviruses. This suggests that viruses use NGLY1/PNG-1 in some hosts, for example humans, to edit particular N-glycosylated residues to aspartic acid, but that in other hosts, often in bats, an N to D substitution mutation in the virus genome is selected. Single nucleotide mutations in Asp or Asn codons can produce viruses with N to D or D to N substitutions that might be selected in different animal hosts from the population of viral variants produced in any previous host. NGLY1/PNG-1 has been implicated in viral immunity in mammalian cell culture, favoring this hypothesis. Because of the phylogenetic evidence that the NGLY1/PNG-1 editing of protein sequences has functional importance for SKN-1A/NRF1 and viruses, and because most immunization protocols do not address the probable editing and functional importance of N-glycosylated aspargines to aspartic acid in normal viral infections, we suggest that immunization with viral proteins engineered to substitute D at genomically encoded NxS/T sites of N-glycosylated viral proteins that show a high frequency of N to D substitution in viral phylogeny may enhance immunological response to peptide antigens. Such genomically-edited peptides would not require ER-localization for N-glycosylation or other cell compartment localization for NGLY1/PNG-1 N to D protein editing. In addition, such N to D edited protein vaccines could be produced in bacteria since N-glycosylation and deglycosylation which do not occur in bacteria would no longer be required to immunize with a D-substituted peptide. Bacterially-expressed vaccines would be much lower cost and with fewer failure modes than attenuated viral vaccines or recombinant animal viruses produced in chicken eggs, mammalian tissue culture cells, or delivered by mRNA vectors to the patient directly. Because N to D edited peptides are clearly produced by NGLY1/PNG-1, and may be and presented by mammalian HLA, such peptides may more robustly activate T-cell killing or B-cell maturation to mediate more robust viral immunity.","Ruvkun, Gary; Sadreyev, Ruslan; Ji, Fei",,,326

517901,Mania Precipitated by COVID-19 Pandemic-Related Stress,2020,"PURPOSE: Throughout the SARS-CoV2 pandemic, multiple reports show higher percentages of hospitalization, morbidity, and mortality among men than women, indicating that men are more affected by COVID-19. The pathophysiology of this difference is yet not established, but recent studies suggest that sex hormones may influence the viral infectivity process. Here, we review the current evidence of androgen sensitivity as a decisive factor for COVID-19 disease severity. METHODS: Relevant literature investigating the role of androgens in COVID-19 was assessed. Further, we describe several drugs suggested as beneficial for COVID-19 treatment related to androgen pathways. Lastly, we looked at androgen sensitivity as a predictor for COVID-19 progression and ongoing clinical trials on androgen suppression therapies as a line of treatment. RESULTS: SARS-COV2 virus spike proteins utilize Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) for host entry. Androgen receptors are transcription promoters for TMPRSS2 and can, therefore, facilitate SARS-COV2 entry. Variants in the androgen receptor gene correlate with androgen sensitivity and are implicated in diseases like androgenetic alopecia and prostate cancer, conditions that have been associated with worse COVID-19 outcomes and hospitalization. CONCLUSION: Androgen's TMPRSS2-mediated actions might explain both the low fatalities observed in prepubertal children and the differences between sexes regarding SARS-COV2 infection. Androgen sensitivity may be a critical factor in determining COVID-19 disease severity, and sensitivity tests can, therefore, help in predicting patient outcomes.","Mohamed, Mohamed S; Moulin, Thiago C; Schiöth, Helgi B",Endocrine,,326

Thematic analysis was used to identify patterns within data from sixteen semi-structured interviews with people employed or recently employed in the restaurant industry during July of 2020. Five themes were highlighted including fear of being exposed to the COVID-19 virus while working under inadequate safety policies, job insecurity, inconsistent pay and hours and a lack of health benefits and paid time off, all of which increased occupational stress and led to uncertainty if respondents would return to the restaurant industry. Hardships associated with the pandemic were mitigated by the support and connections fostered by the communities built within the restaurants. Results led to several recommendations to address the social and economic contributors to occupational stress at the structural and population levels which can be used in the current and post-pandemic workplace.","Lippert, Julia F.; Furnari, Mackenzie B.; Kriebel, Charlie W.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph181910378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34639678/,326

Comment on “Diagnostic Accuracy of Web-Based COVID-19 Symptom Checkers: Comparison Study”,2021-05-21,"The high risk of morbidity and mortality associated with SARS-CoV-2 has accelerated the development of many potential vaccines. However, these vaccines are designed against SARS-CoV-2 isolated in Wuhan, China, and thereby may not be effective against other SARS-CoV-2 variants such as the United Kingdom variant (VUI-202012/01). The UK SARS-CoV-2 variant possesses D614G mutation in the Spike protein, which impart it a high rate of infection. Therefore, newer strategies are warranted to design novel vaccines and drug candidates specifically designed against the mutated forms of SARS-CoV-2. One such strategy is to target ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme2)–Spike protein RBD (receptor binding domain) interaction. Here, we generated a homology model of Spike protein RBD of SARS-CoV-2 UK strain and screened a marine seaweed database employing different computational approaches. On the basis of high-throughput virtual screening, standard precision, and extra precision molecular docking, we identified BE011 (Dieckol) as the most potent compounds against RBD. However, Dieckol did not display drug-like properties, and thus different derivatives of it were generated in silico and evaluated for binding potential and drug-like properties. One Dieckol derivative (DK07) displayed good binding affinity for RBD along with acceptable physicochemical, pharmacokinetic, drug-likeness, and ADMET properties. Analysis of the RBD–DK07 interaction suggested the formation of hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions with key residues mediating the ACE2–RBD interaction. Molecular dynamics simulation confirmed the stability of the RBD–DK07 complex. Free energy calculations suggested the primary role of electrostatic and Van der Waals’ interaction in stabilizing the RBD–DK07 complex. Thus, DK07 may be developed as a potential inhibitor of the RBD–ACE2 interaction. However, these results warrant further validation by in vitro and in vivo studies.","Aatif, Mohammad; Muteeb, Ghazala; Alsultan, Abdulrahman; Alshoaibi, Adil; Khelif, Bachir Yahia",Mar Drugs,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33922914/; https://doi.org/10.3390/md19050242,326

622764,Authors’ Reply to: Redundancy of Terms in Search Strategies. Comment on “Searching PubMed to Retrieve Publications on the COVID-19 Pandemic: Comparative Analysis of Search Strings”,2021-05-28,"Pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and poses an unprecedented challenge to healthcare systems due to the lack of a vaccine and specific treatment options. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to understand precisely the pathogenic mechanisms underlying this multifaceted disease. There is increasing evidence that the immune system reacts insufficiently to SARS-CoV-2 and thus contributes to organ damage and to lethality. In this review, we suggest that the overwhelming production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting in oxidative stress is a major cause of local or systemic tissue damage that leads to severe COVID-19. It increases the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and suppresses the adaptive arm of the immune system, i.e. T cells that are necessary to kill virus-infected cells. This creates a vicious cycle that prevents a specific immune response against SARS-CoV-2. The key role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 implies that therapeutic counterbalancing of ROS by antioxidants such as vitamin C or NAC and/or by antagonizing ROS production by cells of the MPS and neutrophil granulocytes and/or by blocking of TNF-α can prevent COVID-19 from becoming severe. Controlled clinical trials and preclinical models of COVID-19 are needed to evaluate this hypothesis.","Schönrich, Günther; Raftery, Martin J.; Samstag, Yvonne",Adv Biol Regul,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221249262030052X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbior.2020.100741; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S221249262030052X; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32773102/,326

While there are many local and international guidelines on inpatient management of diabetes, the complicated pathology of the virus, the use of glucose-elevating drugs such as glucocorticoids, antivirals and even inotropes, and various other unique problems has made the management of in-hospital hyperglycemia among patients with COVID-19 much more difficult than in other infections. The objective of this guidance is to collate and integrate the best available evidence that has been published regarding in-patient management of diabetes among patients with COVID-19. A comprehensive review of literature was done and recommendations have been made through a consensus of expert endocrinologists from the University of the Philippines-Philippine General Hospital (UP-PGH) Division of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism. These recommendations are evolving as we continue to understand the pathology of the disease and how persons with diabetes are affected by this virus.","Jimeno, Cecilia; Anonuevo-Cruz, Ma.

637803,Impact of Systematic Factors on the Outbreak Outcomes of the Novel COVID-19 Disease in China: Factor Analysis Study,2020-11-11,"Abstract This chapter gives a summary of the economic development of Hong Kong. Since its early colonial days, Hong Kong has been an open port serving China and the international community. Reexport trade was the traditional advantage until 1949, when China adopted a closed-door policy. Industrialization since the 1950s has brought growth and expansion, taking advantage of the low cost of labor and the British legal system. However, the situation changed after the early 1980s, partly because of low costs in China pulled investment from Hong Kong, and the post-1997 political uncertainty also resulted in short-term investment behavior. Economic overheating in the mid-1990s led to severe recession after the Asian financial crisis. Economic restructuring has been slow since 1997. Economic narrowness with concentration in real estate development and finance, together with an increase in welfare spending, lowered competitiveness. Economic integration with China would best be based on comparative advantage, with “win, win” outcomes.","Li, Kui-Wai",Redefining Capitalism in Global Economic Development,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780128041819000173; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780128041819000173,326
642421,Disease Concept-Embedding Based on the Self-Supervised Method for Medical Information Extraction from Electronic Health Records and Disease Retrieval: Algorithm Development and Validation Study,2021-01-27,"Coronaviruses encode a mix of highly conserved and novel genes as well as genetic elements necessary for infection and pathogenesis, raising the possibility for common targets for attenuation and therapeutic design. In this study, we focus on the highly conserved nonstructural protein (NSP) 16, a viral 2’O methyl-transferase (MTase) that encodes critical functions in immune modulation and infection. Using reverse genetics, we disrupted a key motif in the conserved KDKE motif of MERS NSP16 (D130A) and evaluated the effect on viral infection and pathogenesis. While the absence of 2’O MTase activity had only marginal impact on propagation and replication in Vero cells, the MERS dNSP16 mutant demonstrated significant attenuation relative to control both in primary human airway cultures and in vivo. Further examination indicated the MERS dNSP16 mutant had a type I IFN based attenuation and was partially restored in the absence of IFIT molecules. Importantly, the robust attenuation permitted use of MERS dNSP16 as a live attenuated vaccine platform protecting from challenge with a mouse adapted MERS-CoV strain. These studies demonstrate the importance of the conserved 2’O MTase activity for CoV pathogenesis and highlight NSP16 as a conserved universal target for rapid live attenuated vaccine design in an expanding CoV outbreak setting. Coronavirus emergence in both human and livestock represents a significant threat to global public health, as evidenced by the sudden emergence of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, PEDV and swine delta coronavirus in the 21st century. These studies describe an approach that effectively targets the highly conserved 2’O methyl-transferase activity of coronaviruses for attenuation. With clear understanding of the IFN/IFIT based mechanism, NSP16 mutants provide a suitable target for a live attenuated vaccine platform as well as therapeutic development for both current and future emergent CoV strains. Importantly, other approaches targeting other conserved pan-coronavirus functions have not yet proven effective against MERS-CoV, illustrating the broad applicability of targeting viral 2’O MTase function across coronaviruses.","Menachery, Vineet D.; Gralinski, Lisa E.; Mitchell, Hugh D.; Dinnon, Kenneth H.; Leist, Sarah R.; Yount, Boyd L.; Graham, Rachel L.; McAnarney, Eileen T.; Stratton, Kelly G.; Cockrell, Adam S.; Debbink, Kari; Sims, Amy C.; Waters, Katrina M.; Baric, Ralph S.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/173286,326

Since no evidence-based approach is yet available, this survey was conducted to explore the Iraqi rheumatologists’ attitude in the era of COVID-19 and how they have been managing their patients, especially with the continuously updating and sometimes conflicting reports. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was distributed online via telephone and social media to rheumatologists in Iraq. A questionnaire was conducted about methods of patient education, preventive measures, and methods of arranging visits and treatment. In addition, an inquiry about the similarity of the practice between their local institutions and global ones. RESULTS: 144 rheumatologists answered the 14 obligatory questions, of which the majority were specialists. 122 rheumatologists participated in patient education. Half of participants used online information, social media and websites as a source to communicate and interact with their patients for education about COVID-19-related issues. CONCLUSION: Despite the lack of solid guidelines regarding the management of rheumatic diseases during the COVID-19 crisis, this survey showed the majority of Iraqi rheumatologists to be familiar with the updating recommendations. Also, as the majority are waiting for stronger evidence before attempting to embrace controversial issues, surely this reflects a responsible and scientific attitude.","Jassim, Nizar Abdulateef; Yasiry, Dina; Hummadi, Yasameen Abbass",Mediterr J Rheumatol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33196009/; https://doi.org/10.31138/mjr.31.3.299,326

It is thus essential to understand how the virus interacts with the host immune system to bring about these varied outcomes and to inform vaccine development. We now know that both antibody and T cell responses are induced in the majority of infected individuals, and that cross-reactive responses from other coronaviruses also exist in the uninfected population. Innate immune responses are a key focus of research and may influence the course of disease and the character of subsequent adaptive responses. Finally, baseline immune profiles and changes during early acute infection may be key to predicting the course of disease. Understanding all these aspects can help to create better immune monitoring tools for COVID-19, including tools for predicting disease severity or specific sequelae, perhaps even prior to infection.","Maecker, Holden T",J Immunother Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33963016/; https://doi.org/10.1136/jitc-2021-002550,326

649955,"Association of Perceived Threat, Negative Emotions, and Self-Efficacy With Mental Health and Personal Protective Behavior Among Chinese Pregnant Women During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Cross-sectional Survey Study",2021-04-12,"BACKGROUND: We have previously described an evolutionarily selected Tibetan prolyl hydroxylase-2 (PHD2(D4E;C127S)) variant that degrades the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIFα) more efficiently and protects these highlanders from hypoxia-triggered elevation in haemoglobin concentration. High altitude is known to cause acute mountain sickness (AMS) and high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) in a section of rapidly ascending non-acclimatised lowlanders. These morbidities are often accompanied by inflammatory response and exposure to hypobaric hypoxia is presumed to be the principal causative agent. We have investigated whether PHD2(D4E;C127S) variant is associated with prevention of hypoxia-mediated inflammatory milieu in Tibetan highlanders and therefore identify a potential target to regulate inflammation. METHODS: We genotyped the Tibetans using DNA isolated from whole blood. Thereafter immunophenotying was performed on PBMCs from homozygous PHD2(D4E;C127S) and PHD2(WT) individuals using flow cytometry. RNA isolated from these individuals was used to evaluate the peripheral level of important transcripts associated with immune as well as hypoxia response employing the nCounter technology. The ex-vivo findings were validated by generating monocytic cell lines (U937 cell line) expressing PHD2(D4E;C127S) and PHD2(WT) variants post depletion of endogenous PHD2. We had also collected whole blood samples from healthy travellers and travellers afflicted with AMS and HAPE to evaluate the significance of our ex-vivo and in vitro findings. Hereafter, we also attempted to resolve hypoxia-triggered inflammation in vitro as well as in vivo by augmenting the function of PHD2 using alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG), a co-factor of PHD2. FINDINGS: We report that homozygous PHD2(D4E;C127S) highlanders harbour less inflammatory and patrolling monocytes in circulation as compared to Tibetan PHD2(WT) highlanders. In response to in vitro hypoxia, secretion of IL6 and IL1β from PHD2(D4E;C127S) monocytes, and their chemotactic response compared to the PHD2(WT) are compromised, corresponding to the down-modulated expression of related signalling molecules RELA, JUN, STAT1, ATF2 and CXCR4. We verified these functional outcomes in monocytic U937 cell line engineered to express PHD2(D4E;C127S) and confirmed the down-modulation of the signalling molecules at protein level under hypoxia. In contrast, non-Tibetan sojourners with AMS and HAPE at high altitude (3,600 m above sea level) displayed significant increase in these inflammatory parameters. Our data henceforth underline the role of gain-of-function of PHD2 as the rate limiting factor to harness hyper-activation of monocytes in hypoxic environment. Therefore upon pre-treatment with αKG, we observed diminished inflammatory response of monocytes in vitro and reduction in leukocyte infiltration to the lungs in mice exposed to normobaric hypoxia. INTERPRETATION: Our report suggests that gain-of-function PHD2 (D4E;C127S) variant can therefore protect against inflammation elicited by hypobaric hypoxia. Augmentation of PHD2 activity therefore may be an important method to alleviate inflammatory response to inspired hypoxia.

650941,Evaluating Identity Disclosure Risk in Fully Synthetic Health Data: Model Development and Validation,2020-11-16,"PURPOSE: The COVID-19 pandemic poses a major challenge for medical students’ learning and has become a potential stressor, with a profound influence on their psychological well-being. We aimed to determine the effect of the current pandemic on undergraduate medical students’ learning. We also explored the association of their stress level with coping strategies, educational, and psychological variables. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional design study, and participants were the 1st to 5th year medical students. A self-administered questionnaire (18 items) and a well-known Kessler 10 Psychological Distress questionnaire (10 items) were used to collect the data related to perceived stress with an association of educational, psychological, and coping variables. RESULTS: The prevalence of overall stress was significantly higher (χ(2)= 16.3; P=0.000) in female medical students, ie, (40%) as compared to the male students (16.6%), and was highest (48.8%) during the 3rd medical year. It was also noted that the most effective strategy, embraced by students to cope with the severe stress, was “indulging in religious activities” (OR= 1.08; P=0.81). Furthermore, 22.3% of students had perceived severe stress as they did not prefer online learning. Similarly, those students who have not believed or refused the online learning or disagree in “there is pleasure in the study due to COVID” they have significantly higher stress (χ(2)=39.7; P=0.000) 21.5% mild, 17.8% of moderate, and 21.2% severe. CONCLUSION: We found that the COVID-19 pandemic has induced stress and changes in medical students’ educational attitudes and strategies. The results exhibited that the predominance of stress is higher in females than males, and also more stress was perceived by the students during their transitional year, ie, 3rd medical year (from pre-clinical to clinical) and also the respondents who regularly did religious meditation were at lower levels of stress. COVID-19’s influence on medical education and students’ well-being will be felt at an extended level, which necessitates an appropriate plan for preparedness.","Abdulghani, Hamza Mohammad; Sattar, Kamran; Ahmad, Tauseef; Akram, Ashfaq",Psychol Res Behav Manag,https://doi.org/10.2147/prbm.s276938; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33154682/,326

It has been suggested that these shock fronts may increase the spread of COVID-19 by propelling respiratory particles containing the SARS-CoV-2 virus several meters due to particle entrainment in the low pressure area behind the shocks. To determine the likelihood of this occurring, fluorescent particles, ranging in size from 10–50 μm, were dropped into the shock regions produced by a trombone, a trumpet, and a shock tube. Preliminary results indicate that propagation of small airborne particles by the shock fronts radiating from brass wind instruments is unlikely.","Moore, Thomas R.; Cannaday, Ashley E.",J Acoust Soc Am,https://doi.org/10.1121/10.0002182; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33138536/,326

The linkage between and understanding of the physical dose and induced biological perturbations are opening entirely new areas of application. The ability to define anatomic extent of disease and the elucidation of the biology of metastases has brought a key role for radiation oncology for treating metastatic disease. That radiation can stimulate and suppress subpopulations of the immune response makes radiation a key participant in cancer immunotherapy. Targeted radiopharmaceutical therapy delivers radiation systemically with radionuclides and carrier molecules selected for their physical, chemical, and biochemical properties. Radiation oncology usage of “big data” and machine learning and artificial intelligence adds the opportunity to markedly change the workflow for clinical practice while physically targeting and adapting radiation fields in real time. Future precision targeting requires multidimensional understanding of the imaging, underlying biology, and anatomical relationship among tissues for radiation as spatial and temporal “focused biology.” Other means of energy delivery are available as are agents that can be activated by radiation with increasing ability to target treatments. With broad applicability of radiation in cancer treatment, radiation therapy is a necessity for effective cancer care, opening a career path for global health serving the medically underserved in geographically isolated populations as a substantial societal contribution addressing health disparities.

This study aimed to validate the Health Care Empowerment Questionnaire (HCEQ), a patient‐reported experience measure of empowerment, for use with patients with arthritis and other rheumatic diseases. METHODS: The HCEQ measures Patient Information Seeking (or Involvement in Decisions) and Healthcare Interaction Results (or Involvement in Interactions) and asks respondents to answer questions in two ways: whether they feel something happened and its importance to them. Face validity was assessed through qualitative data (n = 8, nominal group technique; n = 55, focus groups). Measure structure was assessed through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA); internal consistency was also assessed (n = 9226). Test‐retest reliability was assessed with sub‐sample of participants (n = 182). RESULTS: We found adequate face validity of the HCEQ for patients with arthritis. The CFA indicated good fit to the data for the two‐factor structure of the HCEQ (RMSEA = 0.075; CFI = 0.987; TLI = 0.978; SRMR = 0.026). Internal consistency was strong (α=0.94 for both subscales). Test‐retest reliability was moderate for Patient Information Seeking (ICC=0.67) and good for Healthcare Interaction Results (ICC=0.77). CONCLUSIONS: The HCEQ, with modifications, demonstrated promising psychometric properties within this sample, laying the foundation for further assessment. This work supports the HCEQ as an appropriate instrument for examining experiences with and perceived importance of empowerment in individuals with arthritis and other rheumatic conditions.

METHODS: an adapted risk stratification tool was circulated to all staff through their respective heads of departments/units. Staff were expected to voluntary assess their health and risk status in the context of COVID-19, using the tool. A central multi-disciplinary screening committee assessed submissions and invited staff who required further evaluation for physical interviews. Respondents were categorized into three risk/exposure groups from lowest to highest - A, B, and C, based on their individual health assessments, occupational exposures, and information obtained from direct interviews. RESULTS: the committee received submissions from 746 staff, representing 19.4% (about a fifth) of the hospital’s 3,840 staff. One hundred and twenty two of these were invited for physical interviews, of whom 88 (72.1%) were categorized as high risk (Category C): pregnancy (53.4%); bronchial asthma (19.3%); hypertension (11.4%); cancer (3.4%) and sickle cell disease (2.3%); fractures and pulmonary tuberculosis (1%, respectively). These staff were recommended for redeployment from areas of high risk exposure to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: a management-driven risk assessment of hospital staff in preparation for the COVID-19 pandemic revealed that a fifth of staff assessed themselves as being vulnerable to adverse outcomes from exposure.

This study aims to understand changes in combustible cigarette and e-cigarette use among U.S. adults. Methods In August 2020, a cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of adults aged ≥18 years in the National Opinion Research Center's AmeriSpeak Panel who reported past 6–month use of combustible cigarettes or e-cigarettes was conducted. Multivariable logistic regression assessed factors associated with increased product use and quit attempts since hearing about COVID-19. Results A total of 1,024 past 6–month cigarette smokers/e-cigarette users were surveyed. Among cigarette smokers, 45% reported no change in cigarette smoking and 33% increased cigarette smoking since hearing about COVID-19. Higher stress was associated with increased cigarette smoking. Among e-cigarette users, 41% reported no change in and 23% reported increasing e-cigarette use. Twenty-six percent of cigarette smokers and 41% of e-cigarette users tried to quit because of COVID-19. Higher perceived risk of COVID-19 was associated with attempts to quit combustible cigarettes (AOR=2.37, 95% CI=1.59, 3.55) and e-cigarettes (AOR=3.14, 95% CI=1.73, 5.70). Conclusions Cigarette and e-cigarette use patterns varied in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most cigarette smokers and e-cigarette users perceived product use as increasing COVID-19-related health risks, and this was associated with attempts to quit. Some cigarette smokers, especially those reporting higher stress, increased product use.
