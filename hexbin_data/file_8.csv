8,Heme oxygenase-1 and carbon monoxide in pulmonary medicine,2003-08-07,"Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an inducible stress protein, confers cytoprotection against oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. In addition to its physiological role in heme degradation, HO-1 may influence a number of cellular processes, including growth, inflammation, and apoptosis. By virtue of anti-inflammatory effects, HO-1 limits tissue damage in response to proinflammatory stimuli and prevents allograft rejection after transplantation. The transcriptional upregulation of HO-1 responds to many agents, such as hypoxia, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. HO-1 and its constitutively expressed isozyme, heme oxygenase-2, catalyze the rate-limiting step in the conversion of heme to its metabolites, bilirubin IXα, ferrous iron, and carbon monoxide (CO). The mechanisms by which HO-1 provides protection most likely involve its enzymatic reaction products. Remarkably, administration of CO at low concentrations can substitute for HO-1 with respect to anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, suggesting a role for CO as a key mediator of HO-1 function. Chronic, low-level, exogenous exposure to CO from cigarette smoking contributes to the importance of CO in pulmonary medicine. The implications of the HO-1/CO system in pulmonary diseases will be discussed in this review, with an emphasis on inflammatory states.","Slebos, Dirk-Jan; Ryter, Stefan W; Choi, Augustine MK",Respir Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC193681/,8
426,Cancer Biomarker Discovery: The Entropic Hallmark,2010-08-18,"BACKGROUND: It is a commonly accepted belief that cancer cells modify their transcriptional state during the progression of the disease. We propose that the progression of cancer cells towards malignant phenotypes can be efficiently tracked using high-throughput technologies that follow the gradual changes observed in the gene expression profiles by employing Shannon's mathematical theory of communication. Methods based on Information Theory can then quantify the divergence of cancer cells' transcriptional profiles from those of normally appearing cells of the originating tissues. The relevance of the proposed methods can be evaluated using microarray datasets available in the public domain but the method is in principle applicable to other high-throughput methods. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using melanoma and prostate cancer datasets we illustrate how it is possible to employ Shannon Entropy and the Jensen-Shannon divergence to trace the transcriptional changes progression of the disease. We establish how the variations of these two measures correlate with established biomarkers of cancer progression. The Information Theory measures allow us to identify novel biomarkers for both progressive and relatively more sudden transcriptional changes leading to malignant phenotypes. At the same time, the methodology was able to validate a large number of genes and processes that seem to be implicated in the progression of melanoma and prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We thus present a quantitative guiding rule, a new unifying hallmark of cancer: the cancer cell's transcriptome changes lead to measurable observed transitions of Normalized Shannon Entropy values (as measured by high-througput technologies). At the same time, tumor cells increment their divergence from the normal tissue profile increasing their disorder via creation of states that we might not directly measure. This unifying hallmark allows, via the the Jensen-Shannon divergence, to identify the arrow of time of the processes from the gene expression profiles, and helps to map the phenotypical and molecular hallmarks of specific cancer subtypes. The deep mathematical basis of the approach allows us to suggest that this principle is, hopefully, of general applicability for other diseases.","Berretta, Regina; Moscato, Pablo",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2923618/,8
1239,Assessment of the Evolution of Cancer Treatment Therapies,2011-08-12,"Cancer therapy has been characterized throughout history by ups and downs, not only due to the ineffectiveness of treatments and side effects, but also by hope and the reality of complete remission and cure in many cases. Within the therapeutic arsenal, alongside surgery in the case of solid tumors, are the antitumor drugs and radiation that have been the treatment of choice in some instances. In recent years, immunotherapy has become an important therapeutic alternative, and is now the first choice in many cases. Nanotechnology has recently arrived on the scene, offering nanostructures as new therapeutic alternatives for controlled drug delivery, for combining imaging and treatment, applying hyperthermia, and providing directed target therapy, among others. These therapies can be applied either alone or in combination with other components (antibodies, peptides, folic acid, etc.). In addition, gene therapy is also offering promising new methods for treatment. Here, we present a review of the evolution of cancer treatments, starting with chemotherapy, surgery, radiation and immunotherapy, and moving on to the most promising cutting-edge therapies (gene therapy and nanomedicine). We offer an historical point of view that covers the arrival of these therapies to clinical practice and the market, and the promises and challenges they present.","Arruebo, Manuel; Vilaboa, Nuria; Sáez-Gutierrez, Berta; Lambea, Julio; Tres, Alejandro; Valladares, Mónica; González-Fernández, África",Cancers (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3759197/,8
1438,Glycyrrhizin improves p75NTR-associated sciatic nerve regeneration in a BALB/c mouse model,2014-02-14,"Glycyrrhizin has a role in immune regulation in the central nervous system, but its impact on sciatic nerve injury had not previously been reported. In this study, a BALB/c mouse model of sciatic nerve injury was used to explore the role of glycyrrhizin in sciatic nerve repair and its underlying mechanism. Glycyrrhizin with intragastric gavage of 10 and 20 mg/kg weight per day (mid- and high-dose, respectively) inhibited p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) expression at the protein and mRNA levels versus the 5 mg/kg (low-dose) group and control (0.9% NaCl solution) at one, two, four and eight weeks following sciatic nerve injury, and simultaneously improved the action potential amplitude and motor nerve conductive velocity. Combined Marsland, Glees and Erikson’s silver stain and Luxol fast blue staining results indicated that high- and mid-dose glycyrrhizin promoted improved sciatic nerve myelination compared with the low-dose or control groups eight weeks after injury. Immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that glycyrrhizin had an inhibitory effect to a certain degree on local hypertrophic scar and inflammatory responses in the mouse model. In conclusion, glycyrrhizin can promote sciatic nerve regeneration and functional repair, in which doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg per day are more effective than lower doses, and such regeneration is associated with the downregulation of p75NTR.","JIA, YU-XI; LI, JIN-RAN; MAO, CUI-YING; YIN, WEI-TIAN; JIANG, RI-HUA",Exp Ther Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3991491/,8
1815,Contact pathway of coagulation and inflammation,2015-05-06,"The contact system, also named as plasma kallikrein-kinin system, consists of three serine proteinases: coagulation factors XII (FXII) and XI (FXI), and plasma prekallikrein (PK), and the nonenzymatic cofactor high molecular weight kininogen (HK). This system has been investigated actively for more than 50 years. The components of this system and their interactions have been elucidated from in vitro experiments, which indicates that this system is prothrombotic by activating intrinsic pathway, and proinflammatory by producing bioactive peptide bradykinin. Although the activation of the contact system have been implicated in various types of human disease, in only a few instances is its role clearly defined. In the last 10 years, our understanding of the contact system, particularly its biology and (patho)physiology has greatly increased through investigations using gene-modified animal models. In this review we will describe a revitalized view of the contact system as a critical (patho)physiologic mediator of coagulation and inflammation.","Wu, Yi",Thromb J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4421925/,8

2501,Ethyl pyruvate is a novel anti-inflammatory agent to treat multiple inflammatory organ injuries,2016-12-03,"Ethyl pyruvate (EP) is a simple derivative of pyruvic acid, which is an important endogenous metabolite that can scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS). Treatment with EP is able to ameliorate systemic inflammation and multiple organ dysfunctions in multiple animal models, such as acute pancreatitis, alcoholic liver injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute viral myocarditis, acute kidney injury and sepsis. Recent studies have demonstrated that prolonged treatment with EP can ameliorate experimental ulcerative colitis and slow multiple tumor growth. It has become evident that EP has pharmacological anti-inflammatory effect to inhibit multiple early inflammatory cytokines and the late inflammatory cytokine HMGB1 release, and the anti-tumor activity is likely associated with its anti-inflammatory effect. EP has been tested in human volunteers and in a clinical trial of patients undergoing cardiac surgery in USA and shown to be safe at clinical relevant doses, even though EP fails to improve outcome of the heart surgery, EP is still a promising agent to treat patients with multiple inflammatory organ injuries and the other clinical trials are on the way. This review focuses on how EP is able to ameliorate multiple organ injuries and summarize recently published EP investigations.

2731,PTH[1-34] improves the effects of core decompression in early-stage steroid-associated osteonecrosis model by enhancing bone repair and revascularization,2017-05-31,"Steroid-associated osteonecrosis (SAON) might induce bone collapse and subsequently lead to joint arthroplasty. Core decompression (CD) is regarded as an effective therapy for early-stage SAON, but the prognosis is unsatisfactory due to incomplete bone repair. Parathyroid hormone[1–34] (PTH[1–34]) has demonstrated positive efficacy in promoting bone formation. We therefore evaluated the effects of PTH on improving the effects of CD in Early-Stage SAON. Distal femoral CD was performed two weeks after osteonecrosis induction or vehicle injection, with ten of the ON-induced rabbits being subjected to six-week PTH[1–34] treatment and the others, including ON-induced and non-induced rabbits, being treated with vehicle. MRI confirmed that intermittent PTH administration improved SAON after CD therapy. Micro-CT showed increased bone formation within the tunnel. Bone repair was enhanced with decreased empty osteocyte lacunae and necrosis foci area, resulting in enhanced peak load and stiffness of the tunnel. Additionally, PTH enlarged the mean diameter of vessels in the marrow and increased the number of vessels within the tunnels, as well as elevated the expression of BMP-2, RUNX2, IGF-1, bFGF and VEGF, together with serum OCN and VEGF levels. Therefore, PTH[1–34] enhances the efficacy of CD on osteogenesis and neovascularization, thus promoting bone and blood vessels repair in the SAON model.","Zhou, Chen-he; Meng, Jia-hong; Zhao, Chen-chen; Ye, Chen-yi; Zhu, Han-xiao; Hu, Bin; Heng, Boon Chin; Shen, Yue; Lin, Tiao; Yang, Xiao-bo; Shi, Zhong-li; Shen, Wei-liang; Yan, Shi-gui",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5451136/,8
3195,Evaluation of the hepatoprotective effect of combination between hinokiflavone and Glycyrrhizin against CCl(4) induced toxicity in rats,2018-02-11,"Liver diseases are one of the fatal syndromes due to the vital role of the liver. Most of the effective treatment of liver conditions are of natural origin. Silymarin (SI) is the standard drug used for treatment of impaired liver functions. Two natural compounds possessing promising liver protection and with different chemical structures namely; the bioflavonoid hinokiflavone (HF) isolated from Junipers phoenicea family Cupressaceae and the sweet saponin Glycyrrhizin (GL) present in Glycyrrhiza glabra (liquorice) were selected for the current study. Since the two compounds are of different nature, they may act by different mechanisms and express synergistic effect. Combination of the two compounds using to dose levels were challenged with single doses of HF, GL and SI as well. The comparison was monitored via measuring serum biochemical parameters including, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total bilirubin, tissue parameters such as MDA, NP-SH and TP, histopathological study using light and electron microscope. Protective effect on kidney was also monitored histopathologically and biochemically through observing the levels of LDH, creatinine, creatinine-kinase, urea and uric acid. The combinations of HF and GL showed protective effect more than the used single doses of HF and GL alone. However, SI was superior to the used combination in the two used doses in all the measured parameters. The liver and kidney cells appearance under normal and electron microscope showed that SI treated groups showed almost normal cells with slight toxic signs. Cells from group treated with the higher doses of the combination of HF and GL showed slight signs of intoxication under light and electron microscope indicating good level of protection. Although the combination of HF and GL expressed good protection in the higher dose, however, the combination did not exceed the protective effect of SI.","Abdel-Kader, Maged S.; Abulhamd, Ashraf T.; Hamad, Abubaker M.; Alanazi, Abdullah H.; Ali, Rizwan; Alqasoumi, Saleh I.",Saudi Pharm J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5962645/,8
3253,"Triclosan and triclocarban exposure, infectious disease symptoms and antibiotic prescription in infants—A community-based randomized intervention",2018-06-28,"BACKGROUND: Triclosan and triclocarban (TCs) are broad-spectrum antimicrobials that, until recently, were found in a wide variety of household and personal wash products. Popular with consumers, TCs have not been shown to protect against infectious diseases. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether use of TC-containing wash products reduces incidence of infection in children less than one year of age. METHODS: Starting in 2011, we nested a randomized intervention of wash products with and without TCs within a multiethnic birth cohort. Maternal reports of infectious disease symptoms and antibiotic use were collected weekly by automated survey; household visits occurred every four months. Antibiotic prescriptions were identified by medical chart review. Urinary triclosan levels were measured in a participant subset. Differences by intervention group in reported infectious disease (primary outcome) and antibiotic use (secondary outcome) were assessed using mixed effects logistic regression and Fisher’s Exact tests, respectively. RESULTS: Infectious illness occurred in 6% of weeks, with upper respiratory illness the predominant syndrome. Among 60 (45%) TC-exposed and 73 (55%) non-TC-exposed babies, infectious disease reports did not differ in frequency between groups (likelihood ratio test: p = 0.88). Medical visits with antibiotic prescriptions were less common in the TC group than in the non-TC group (7.8% vs. 16.6%, respectively; p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Although randomization to TC-containing wash products was not associated with decreased infectious disease reports by mothers, TCs were associated with decreased antibiotic prescriptions, suggesting a benefit against bacterial infection. The recent removal of TCs from consumer wash products makes further elucidation of benefits and risks impracticable.","Ley, Catherine; Sundaram, Vandana; Sanchez, Maria de la Luz; Desai, Manisha; Parsonnet, Julie",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6023107/,8
3418,Monitoring the age-specificity of measles transmissions during 2009-2016 in Southern China,2018-10-08,"BACKGROUND: Despite several immunization efforts, China saw a resurgence of measles in 2012. Monitoring of transmissions of individuals from different age groups could offer information that would be valuable for planning adequate disease control strategies. We compared the age-specific effective reproductive numbers (R) of measles during 2009–2016 in Guangdong, China. METHODS: We estimated the age-specific R values for 7 age groups: 0–8 months, 9–18 months, 19 months to 6 years, 7–15 years, 16–25 years, 26–45 years, and ≥46 years adapting the contact matrix of China. The daily numbers of laboratory and clinically confirmed cases reported to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Guangdong were used. RESULTS: The peak R values of the entire population were above unity from 2012 to 2016, indicating the persistence of measles in the population. In general, children aged 0–6 years and adults aged 26–45 years had larger values of R when comparing with other age groups after 2012. While the peaks of R values for children aged 0–6 years dropped steadily after 2013, the peaks of R values for adults aged 26–45 years kept at a high range every year. CONCLUSIONS: Although the provincial supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) conducted in 2009 and 2010 were able to reduce the transmissions from 2009 to 2011, larger values of R for children aged 0–6 years were observed after 2012, indicating that the benefits of the SIAs were short-lived. In addition, the transmissions from adults aged between 26 and 45 years increased over time. Disease control strategies should target children and adult groups that carry high potential for measles transmission.","Chong, Ka Chun; Hu, Pei; Lau, Steven; Jia, Katherine Min; Liang, Wenjia; Wang, Maggie Haitian; Zee, Benny Chung Ying; Sun, Riyang; Zheng, Huizhen",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6175510/,8
3540,A Functionally Different Immune Phenotype in Cattle Is Associated With Higher Mastitis Incidence,2018-12-06,"A novel vaccine against bovine viral diarrhea (BVD) induced pathogenic antibody production in 5–10% of BVD-vaccinated cows. Transfer of these antibodies via colostrum caused Bovine neonatal pancytopenia (BNP) in calves, with a lethality rate of 90%. The exact immunological mechanisms behind the onset of BNP are not fully understood to date. To gain further insight into these mechanisms, we analyzed the immune proteome from alloreactive antibody producers (BNP cows) and non-responders. After in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood derived lymphocytes (PBL), we detected distinctly deviant expression levels of several master regulators of immune responses in BNP cells, pointing to a changed immune phenotype with severe dysregulation of immune response in BNP cows. Interestingly, we also found this response pattern in 22% of non-BVD-vaccinated cows, indicating a genetic predisposition of this immune deviant (ID) phenotype in cattle. We additionally analyzed the functional correlation of the ID phenotype with 10 health parameters and 6 diseases in a retrospective study over 38 months. The significantly increased prevalence of mastitis among ID cows emphasizes the clinical relevance of this deviant immune response and its potential impact on the ability to fight infections.","Lutterberg, Karina; Kleinwort, Kristina J.

Exon skipping by antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) has recently gained recognition as therapeutic approach in DMD. Conjugation of a peptide to the phosphorodiamidate morpholino backbone (PMO) of ASOs generated the peptide-conjugated PMOs (PPMOs) that exhibit a dramatically improved pharmacokinetic profile. When tested in animal models, PPMOs demonstrate effective exon skipping in target muscles and prolonged duration of dystrophin restoration after a treatment regime. Herein we summarize the main pathophysiological features of DMD and the emergence of PPMOs as promising exon skipping agents aiming to rescue defective gene expression in DMD and other neuromuscular diseases.

4227,Fundamental Concepts for Semiquantitative Tissue Scoring in Translational Research,2018-01-01,"Failure to reproduce results from some scientific studies has raised awareness of the critical need for reproducibility in translational studies. Macroscopic and microscopic examination is a common approach to determine changes in tissues, but text descriptions and visual images have limitations for group comparisons. Semiquantitative scoring is a way of transforming qualitative tissue data into numerical data that allow more robust group comparisons. Semiquantitative scoring has broad uses in preclinical and clinical studies for evaluation of tissue lesions. Reproducibility can be improved by constraining bias through appropriate experimental design, randomization of tissues, effective use of multidisciplinary collaborations, and valid masking procedures. Scoring can be applied to tissue lesions (eg, size, distribution, characteristics) and also to tissues through evaluation of staining distribution and intensity. Semiquantitative scores should be validated to demonstrate relevance to biological data and to demonstrate observer reproducibility. Statistical analysis should make use of appropriate tests to give robust confidence in the results and interpretations. Following key principles of semiquantitative scoring will not only enhance descriptive tissue evaluation but also improve quality, reproducibility, and rigor of tissue studies.","Meyerholz, David K; Beck, Amanda P",ILAR Journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6927897/,8
4477,Down Syndrome Reduces the Sedative Effect of Midazolam in Pediatric Cardiovascular Surgical Patients,2020-02-10,"BACKGROUND: Protective mechanical ventilation is recommended for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but it usually requires controlled ventilation and sedation. Using neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) or pressure support ventilation (PSV) could have additional benefits, including the use of lower sedative doses, improved patient–ventilator interaction and shortened duration of mechanical ventilation. We designed a pilot study to assess the feasibility of keeping tidal volume (V(T)) at protective levels with NAVA and PSV in patients with ARDS. METHODS: We conducted a prospective randomized crossover trial in five ICUs from a university hospital in Brazil and included patients with ARDS transitioning from controlled ventilation to partial ventilatory support. NAVA and PSV were applied in random order, for 15 min each, followed by 3 h in NAVA. Flow, peak airway pressure (Paw) and electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) were captured from the ventilator, and a software (Matlab, Mathworks, USA), automatically detected inspiratory efforts and calculated respiratory rate (RR) and V(T). Asynchrony events detection was based on waveform analysis. RESULTS: We randomized 20 patients, but the protocol was interrupted for five (25%) patients for whom we were unable to maintain V(T) below 6.5 mL/kg in PSV due to strong inspiratory efforts and for one patient for whom we could not detect EAdi signal. For the 14 patients who completed the protocol, V(T) was 5.8 ± 1.1 mL/kg for NAVA and 5.6 ± 1.0 mL/kg for PSV (p = 0.455) and there were no differences in RR (24 ± 7 for NAVA and 23 ± 7 for PSV, p = 0.661). Paw was greater in NAVA (21 ± 3 cmH(2)O) than in PSV (19 ± 3 cmH(2)O, p = 0.001). Most patients were under continuous sedation during the study. NAVA reduced triggering delay compared to PSV (p = 0.020) and the median asynchrony Index was 0.7% (0–2.7) in PSV and 0% (0–2.2) in NAVA (p = 0.6835). CONCLUSIONS: It was feasible to keep V(T) in protective levels with NAVA and PSV for 75% of the patients. NAVA resulted in similar V(T), RR and Paw compared to PSV. Our findings suggest that partial ventilatory assistance with NAVA and PSV is feasible as a protective ventilation strategy in selected ARDS patients under continuous sedation.

HSV-1 encephalitis strains were significantly more virulent after nose inoculation (i.e. neuroinvasive) when compared with HSV-1 isolates from patients with oral lesions only, whereas HSV-2 meningitis strains were significantly more virulent after i.c. inoculation when compared with HSV-2 isolates from patients with genital lesions only. No correlation between high neurovirulence (defined as low LD(50) for both routes of infection) and replication in cell cultures of neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines was found, but the weakly neurovirulent HSV-1 strain isolated from a patient with multiple sclerosis gave low replication yields. After nose inoculation, a highly neuroinvasive HSV-1 laboratory reference strain replicated to high titers in nose tissue, the trigeminal ganglia and brainstem, while a strain with low neuroinvasiveness but high i.c. virulence replicated less well in the brainstem.

The cell line contains both mono- and binucleate cells with a prominent rough endoplasmic reticulum characteristic of ruminant trophoblast cells. Susceptibility to eight bovine viruses was demonstrated. Such cell lines may provide inexpensive systems for the study of trophoblast metabolism and for investigation of the role of the trophoblast in the pathogenesis of selected bovine abortifacient diseases.

5737,Antimicrobial treatment guidelines for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis()()()(),2004-03-11,"BACKGROUND: Severe pneumonia caused by influenza virus infection can be secondary to invasive pulmonary fungal (IPF) infection. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to summarize the incidence of IPF infection secondary to influenza virus infection and further explore its etiologic mechanism and high-risk factors. METHODS: All adult patients with confirmed influenza A (H1N1) virus infection admitted to the intensive care units (ICUs) of Nanjing Drum Hospital from November 2017 to March 2018 were retrospectively selected. The differences in baseline factors, risk factors, immune function and outcome parameters were studied between patients with and without IPF. RESULTS: Of the 19 critically ill patients with H1N1 infection, 11 (57.9%) developed IPF infection after 7 days of ICU admission. Two patients had proven and nine probable IPF infection. A difference in human leukocyte antigen–DR isotype (△HLA-DR; day 7–day 1) was found between the two groups. △HLA-DR (day 7–day 1) was higher in patients with no IPF infection than in those with IPF infection [(14.52 ± 14.21)% vs ( − 11.74 ± 20.22)%, P = 0.019]. The decline in HLA-DR indicated impaired immune function secondary to fungal infection in patients with H1N1 infection. CONCLUSIONS: IPF infection was diagnosed in 57.9% of critically ill patients with H1N1 virus infection after a median of 7 days following ICU admission. A continuous decline in immune function could lead to the development of IPF infections. Dynamic monitoring of immune function may help in the early detection of IPF infection.","Yu, Zhuxi; Gu, Qin; Zhang, Beiyuan; Chen, Xiancheng; Tang, Jian; Hou, Yayi; Yu, Wenkui",Mycopathologia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094916/,8

6331,Evidence vs experience in neonatal practices in necrotizing enterocolitis,2008-04-30,"ExoU is a potent proinflammatory toxin produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a major agent of severe lung infection and sepsis. Because inflammation is usually associated with oxidative stress, we investigated the effect of ExoU on free radical production and antioxidant defense mechanisms during the course of P. aeruginosa infection. In an experimental model of acute pneumonia, ExoU accounted for increased lipid peroxidation in mice lungs as soon as 3 h after intratracheal instillation of PA103 P. aeruginosa strain. The contribution of airway cells to the generation of a redox imbalance was assessed by in vitro tests carried out with A549 airway epithelial cells. Cultures infected with the ExoU-producing PA103 P. aeruginosa strain produced significantly increased concentrations of lipid hydroperoxides, 8-isoprostane, reactive oxygen intermediates, peroxynitrite and nitric oxide (NO), when compared to cells infected with exoU-deficient mutants. Overproduction of NO by PA103-infected cells likely resulted from overexpression of both inducible and endothelial NO synthase isoforms. PA103 infection was also associated with a significantly increased activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and decreased levels of reduced glutathione (GSH), a major antioxidant compound. Our findings unveil another potential mechanism of tissue damage during infection by ExoU-producing P. aeruginosa strains.","da Cunha, Luiz Gonzaga; Ferreira, Miriam Francisca; de Moraes, João Alfredo; Reis, Patricia Alves; Castro-Faria-Neto, Hugo Caire; Barja-Fidalgo, Christina; Plotkowski, Maria-Cristina; Saliba, Alessandra Mattos",Med Microbiol Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100071/,8

Clinically he presented a sinustachycardia (160/min) and hypotension (70/60 mmHg). INVESTIGATIONS/DIAGNOSIS: Laboratory analyses showed elevated infection parameters, azotemia, proteinuria and thrombopenia. CD(4+)T-helper cells: 320/µl (32 %), HIV RNA: < 40 copies/ml, Hepatitis B DNA: 20800 copies/ml. Hantavirus serology (immunofluorescence antibody assay): 1:2048; serotype Puumala. TREATMENT/COURSE: An early-goal-directed therapy and antibiotic treatment with Piperacillin and Tazobactam was initiated. The patient developed a bipulmonal infiltrate and an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS ) requiring tracheal intubation, as well as a triad of fever, renal failure and profound hemorrhagic symptoms. This led to the diagnosis of the Puumala infection. Due to the parallel HIV- and Hepatits B infection an antiretroviral therapy was initiated. CONCLUSION: In summary the Puumala infection bears the potential for a severe multi-organ failure, which is not typical for this usually benign infection.","Larbig, Robert; Lehman, Clara; Rottländer, Dennis; Reda, Sara; Michels, Guido; Hoppe, Uta C; Kochanek, Mathias",Wien Med Wochenschr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7100073/,8
6463,Septic shock—an update,1982,"WD-repeat proteins contain four to eight copies of a conserved motif that usually ends with a tryptophan-aspartate (WD) dipeptide. TheSaccharomyces cerevisiae PWP2 gene, identified by sequencing of chromosome III, is predicted to contain eight so-called WD-repeats, flanked by nonhomologous extensions. This gene is expressed as a 3.2-kb mRNA in all cell types and encodes a protein of 104 kDa. ThePWP2 gene is essential for growth because spores carrying thepwp2Δ1::HIS3 disruption germinate before arresting growth with one or two large buds. The growth defect ofpwp2Δ1::HIS3 cells was rescued by expression ofPWP2 or epitope-taggedHA-PWP2 using the galactose-inducibleGAL1 promoter. In the absence of galactose, depletion of Pwp2p resulted in multibudded cells with defects in bud site selection, cytokinesis, and hydrolysis of the septal junction between mother and daughter cells. In cell fractionation studies, HA-Pwp2p was localized in the particulate component of cell lysates, from which it would be solubulized by high salt and alkaline buffer but not by nonionic detergents or urea. Indirect immunofluorescence microscopy indicated that HA-Pwp2p was clustered at multiple points in the cytoplasm. These results suggest that Pwp2p exists in a proteinaceous complex, possibly associated with the cytoskeleton, where it functions in control of cell growth and separation.","Shafaatian, Reza; Payton, Mark A.; Reid, John D.",Mol Gen Genet,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101573/,8
6486,Utility of Coil-Assisted Retrograde Transvenous Obliteration II (CARTO-II) for the Treatment of Gastric Varices,2019-12-24,"Whilst performing its normal functions the lung is required to deal with a range of toxic insults. Whether these are infectious agents, allergens or air pollutants they subject the lung to a range of direct and indirect oxidative stresses. In many instances these challenges lead to oxidative alterations of peptides and proteins within the lung. Measurement of protein oxidation products permits the degree of oxidative stress to be assessed and indicates that endogenous antioxidant defences are overwhelmed. The range of protein oxidation products observed is diverse and the nature and extent of specific oxidation products may inform us about the nature of the damaging ROS and NOS. Recently, there has been a significant shift away from the measurement of these oxidation products simply to establish the presence of oxidative stress, to a focus on identifying specific proteins sensitive to oxidation and establishing the functional consequences of these modifications. In addition the identification of specific enzyme systems to repair these oxidative modifications has lead to the belief that protein function may be regulated through these oxidation reactions. In this review we focus primarily on the soluble protein components of within the surface liquid layer in the lung and the consequence of their undue oxidation.","Kelly, F. J.; Mudway, I.

6529,Study of Acute Exogenous Lipoid Pneumonia,2016-01-29,"OBJECTIVE: To analyse the factors associated with increased mortality among Indian Children with H1N1. METHODS: Data were abstracted from available hospital records of children less than 12 y of age, who were admitted to Sassoon General Hospital in Pune, India, with confirmed pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza infection from August 2009 through January 2010. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify clinical characteristics associated with mortality. RESULTS: Of 775 pediatric cases admitted with Influenza Like Illness (ILI), 92 (11.8%) had confirmed H1N1 influenza infection. The median age of HIN1 cases was 2.5 y; 13 (14%) had an associated co-morbid condition. Median duration of symptoms was 4 d (interquartile range (IQR), 3–7 d). All 92 H1N1 cases received oseltamivir and empiric antimicrobials on admission. Intensive care unit (ICU) admission was required for 88 (96%) children, and 20 (23%) required mechanical ventilation.Fifteen children (16%) died; mortality was associated with presence of diffuse alveolar infiltrate on admission chest radiography (odds ratio (OR) 45, 95%CI :5.4–370; p < 0.001), use of corticosteroids in ARDS in children who required mechanical ventilation (OR 8.12, 95%CI: 2.44–27.05; p = 0.001), SpO(2) <80% on admission (OR 32.8, 95% CI: 5.8–185.5; p < 0.001) and presence of ARDS (OR 345.3, 95% CI :33.5–3564.1; p < 0.001). Necropsy from all children who died showed 9 (60%) had ARDS pattern and necrotizing pneumonitis, diffuse hemorrhage and interstitial pneumonia (n = 4 each, 27%) with gram positive organisms consistent with severe viral and bacterial co-infection. CONCLUSIONS: Hypoxia, ARDS and use of corticosteroids in children with ARDS who were mechanically ventilated were the factors associated with increased odds of mortality. Necropsy also suggested bacterial co-infection as a risk factor.","Kinikar, Aarti Avinash; Kulkarni, Rajesh K.; Valvi, Chhaya T.; Mave, Vidya; Gupte, Nikhil; Khadse, Sandhya; Bhardwaj, Renu; Kagal, Anju; Puranik, Shaila; Gupta, Amita; Bollinger, Robert; Jamkar, Arun",Indian J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101687/,8

Although no prospective clinical trial exists to guide recommendations for optimal and more specific immunosuppressive treatments rather than corticosteroids, further studies may lead to a more mechanistic-based approach towards these toxicities in the future. In relation to current practice, we recommend adherence to the recent published guidelines which emphasize the importance of early recognition and administration of temporary immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids in most cases, depending on the organ system involved, and the severity of toxicity.

Identifying the underlying etiology therefore remains the primary focus for initiating successful management of patients with decompensated pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular failure. Pulmonary embolism requires immediate restoration of pulmonary vascular patency. The body of evidence from studies is scarce and favors dobutamine, NO inhalation, and intravenous prostacyclin. However, the use of other vasoactive substances, inotropes, and supportive measures has been successful in individual patients; it should be guided by the expected effects on the pulmonary vasculature or right ventricle, and should be adapted to the patient’s concomitant diseases.","Meyer, F.J.; Katus, H.A.; Borst, M.M.",Pneumologe (Berl),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102290/,8

In vitro and in vivo studies established that microRNAs (miRNAs) are decisive for endothelial cell gene expression and function in various pathological conditions associated with CVD. This review provides an overview of the miRNA role in controlling the key connections between endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. RECENT FINDINGS: Herein we summarize the present understanding of mechanisms underlying hypertension and its associated endothelial dysfunction as well as the miRNA role in endothelial cells with accent on the modulation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, nitric oxide, oxidative stress and on the control of vascular inflammation and angiogenesis in relation to endothelial dysfunction in hypertension. In particular, latest insights in the identification of endothelial-specific microRNAs and their targets are added to the understanding of miRNA significance in hypertension. SUMMARY: This comprehensive knowledge of the role of miRNAs in endothelial dysfunction and hypertension and of molecular mechanisms proposed for miRNA actions may offer novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for controlling hypertension-associated endothelial dysfunction and other cardiovascular complications.","Nemecz, Miruna; Alexandru, Nicoleta; Tanko, Gabriela; Georgescu, Adriana",Curr Hypertens Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7102349/,8

Sequence analyses revealed that all the 5 strains, as well as many recent field isolates from other researchers, belonged to the QX-like IBV genotype, which were distantly related to commercial vaccine strains. Viral pathogenicity experiments showed that the isolates caused high morbidity and severe ciliostasis in chickens, although they caused milder lethality. This provides further evidence that QX-like IBV emergence remains a major problem in the poultry industry, and information on IBV epidemiology and pathogenicity may help to control IB.","Yan, Shihong; Sun, Yali; Huang, Xiuying; Jia, Wenfeng; Xie, Deqiong; Zhang, Guozhong",Poult Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107289/,8

The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of respiratory illness and its associated factors among Malaysian hajj pilgrims in 2013 and to describe its preventive measures. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Makkah and Malaysia during the 2013 hajj season. A self-administered proforma on social demographics, previous experience of hajj or umrah, smoking habits, co-morbid illness and practices of preventive measures against respiratory illness were obtained. Results. A total of 468 proforma were analysed. The prevalence of the respiratory illness was 93.4% with a subset of 78.2% fulfilled the criteria for influenza-like illness (ILI). Most of them (77.8%) had a respiratory illness of <2 weeks duration. Approximately 61.8% were administered antibiotics but only 2.1% of them had been hospitalized. Most of them acquired the infection after a brief stay at Arafat (81.2%). Vaccination coverages for influenza virus and pneumococcal disease were quite high, 65.2% and 59.4%, respectively. For other preventive measures practices, only 31.8% of them practiced good hand hygiene, ∼82.9% of pilgrims used surgical face masks, N95 face masks, dry towels, wet towels or veils as their face masks. Nearly one-half of the respondents (44.4%) took vitamins as their food supplement. Malaysian hajj pilgrims with previous experience of hajj (OR 0.24; 95% CI 0.10–0.56) or umrah (OR 0.19; 95% CI 0.07–0.52) and those who have practiced good hand hygiene (OR 0.35; 95% CI 0.16–0.79) were found to be significantly associated with lower risk of having respiratory illness. Otherwise, pilgrims who had contact with those with respiratory illness (OR 2.61; 95% CI 1.12–6.09) was associated with higher risk. Conclusions. The prevalence of respiratory illness remains high among Malaysian hajj pilgrims despite having some practices of preventive measures. All preventive measures which include hand hygiene, wearing face masks and influenza vaccination must be practiced together as bundle of care to reduce respiratory illness effectively.","Hashim, Suhana; Ayub, Zeti N.; Mohamed, Zeehaida; Hasan, Habsah; Harun, Azian; Ismail, Nabilah; Rahman, Zaidah A.; Suraiya, Siti; Naing, Nyi Nyi; Aziz, Aniza A.",J Travel Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7107508/,8

Enteric pathogens were identified in 76 (60%) of cases, whereas the etiology remained unidentified in 50 cases (40%). Patients with an identified pathogen did not differ from those with TD of unknown etiology in terms of the time of onset of illness or the median frequency of unformed stools in the first 24 hours. In contrast, the median frequency of unformed stools between 24 and 48 hours (i.e., on the second day) was 1.0 among patients with no pathogen and 2.0 among those with enteric pathogens identified (P < .001). A similar difference was evident on the third day (1.0 vs. 2.5). Moreover, a lower proportion of patients with no pathogen identified had watery stools (28% vs. 55%). The durations of diarrhea and concomitant symptoms were significantly shorter and the recovery from TD was significantly quicker among the patients without an identified pathogen. Patients with one or more invasive pathogens had disease that was clearly more severe than that of patients with no pathogen identified; the difference in severity of disease was less marked for patients with invasive vs. noninvasive pathogens. Individuals with diarrhea due to Campylobacter species tended to have the most severe disease, whereas diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli seemed milder than that caused by other agents. Unfortunately, the clinician has only a limited opportunity to predict the etiology of TD and thus to assess the need for antimicrobial therapy at the onset of disease.","Mattila, Leena",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7109962/,8

Astrocytes contained glial fibrils from one day onwards and often attached their processes to the pial basement membrane. Although the cytoplasmic processes of astrocytes occasionally wrapped axons, they were never shown to form the initial layer of myelin sheaths. However, the tenuous processes of the sub-pial astrocytes were occasionally rolled in myelin lamellae, as if a part of the myelin sheaths was constructed by astrocytic processes.

Assembly of rotavirus has been extensively studied in nonpolarized kidney epithelial MA104 cells, where several data indicate that most if not all the steps of rotavirus assembly take place within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and that rotavirus is release upon cell lysis. We focus here on data obtained in intestinal cells that argue for another scheme of rotavirus assembly, where the final steps seem to take place outside the ER with an apically polarized release of rotavirus without significant cell lysis. One of the key observations made by different groups is that VP4 and other structural proteins interact substantially with specialized membrane microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids termed rafts. In addition, recent data point to the fact that VP4 does not localize within the ER or the Golgi apparatus in infected intestinal cells. The mechanisms by which VP4, a cytosolic protein, may be targeted to the apical membrane in these cells and assembles with the other structural proteins are discussed. The identification of cellular proteins such as Hsp70, flotillin, rab5, PRA1 and cytoskeletal components that interact with VP4 may help to define an atypical polarized trafficking pathway to the apical membrane of intestinal cells that will be raft-dependent and by-pass the classical exocytic route.","Chwetzoff, S.; Trugnan, G.","Reoviruses: Entry, Assembly and Morphogenesis",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122644/,8

A panel of 129 peptides that matched the molecular mimicry motif was tested on seven MBP-specific T cell clones from multiple sclerosis patients. Seven viral and one bacterial peptide efficiently activated three of these clones. Only one peptide could have been identified as a molecular mimic by sequence alignment.

A spontaneous segregant of this strain was no longer partially induced for lactose operon expression, and was no longer pathogenic in the rabbit model. The gene responsible for this phenotype was cloned. The resulting plasmid was shown to cause both partially induced lactose operon expression and pathogenicity when introduced into a laboratory K. pneumoniae strain. A K. pneumoniae mutant deficient in lactose repressor synthesis was also pathogenic in the rabbit model.

They consist of a bilayer of phospholipid molecules in which proteins are embedded. These integral membrane proteins, which cross the bilayer once or several times, generally have a higher than average hydrophobicity and tend to aggregate. Detergents are needed to remove integral membrane proteins from the lipid bilayer and they have to be present during further chromatographic purification. Predominantly, four modes of HPLC have been used alone or in combination for the puridication of integral membrane proteins. These are based on differences of proteins in size (size-exclusion chromatography, SEC), electrostatic interaction (ion-exchange chromatography, IEC), bioaffinity (bioaffinity chromatography, BAC) and hydrophobic interaction (reversed-phase chromatography, RPC, and hydrophobic-interaction chromatography, HIC). SEC, IEC, BAC and HIC are used under relatively mild conditions, and buffer systems generally contain a non-ionic detergent. RPC generally has a denaturing effect on the protein and should preferably be used for the purification of integral membrane proteins smaller than 50 kD.","Welling, Gjalt W.; Van der Zee, Ruurd; Welling-Wester, Sytske",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7148774/,8

The simplest, most sensitive and most rapid method for detection of virus was haemagglutination (HA) which was twice as sensitive as isolation of virus and 8 times as sensitive as electron microscopy (EM). Forty nine of 56 (88%) samples positive for CPV were from dogs < 1 year old and 44 (79%) CPV‐positive samples were from pups < 6 months old; only one sample from a pup < 2 months old (pup was 7 weeks old) was positive. An additional 68 samples (53 faeces and 15 intestinal contents) were submitted from Beagle dogs that were part of a colony of ∼1200 dogs. Epidemiological data pinpoints the entry of CPV into the colony in November 1978 at which time most dogs including pups < 6 months of age developed antibody to CPV without developing clinical disease. From these data an overview of some aspects of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of CPV is constructed.","STUDDERT, M. J.; ODA, C.; RIEGL, C. A.; ROSTON, R.

9859,"The aetiology and epidemiology of common colds, and the possibilities of prevention",2007-08-02,"Entry of enveloped viruses into host cells depends on the interactions of viral surface proteins with cell surface receptors. Many enveloped viruses maximize the efficiency of receptor engagement by first binding to attachment‐promoting factors, which concentrate virions on target cells and thus increase the likelihood of subsequent receptor engagement. Cellular lectins can recognize glycans on viral surface proteins and mediate viral uptake into immune cells for subsequent antigen presentation. Paradoxically, many viral and non‐viral pathogens target lectins to attach to immune cells and to subvert cellular functions to promote their spread. Thus, it has been proposed that attachment of HIV to the dendritic cell lectin DC‐SIGN enables the virus to hijack cellular transport processes to ensure its transmission to adjacent T cells. However, recent studies show that the consequences of viral capture by immune cell lectins can be diverse, and can entail negative and positive regulation of viral spread. Here, we will describe key concepts proposed for the role of lectins in HIV attachment to host cells, and we will discuss recent findings in this rapidly evolving area of research.","Tsegaye, Theodros Solomon; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Cell Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7162262/,8
10005,Construction of a multiplex allele‐specific PCR‐based universal array (ASPUA) and its application to hearing loss screening,2007-12-27,"Upper respiratory illness is the most common reason for non‐injury‐related presentation to a sports medicine clinic, accounting for 35–65% of illness presentations. Recurrent or persistent respiratory illness can have a negative impact on health and performance of athletes undertaking high levels of strenuous exercise. The cause of upper respiratory symptoms (URS) in athletes can be uncertain but the majority of cases are related to common respiratory viruses, viral reactivation, allergic responses to aeroallergens and exercise‐related trauma to the integrity of respiratory epithelial membranes. Bacterial respiratory infections are uncommon in athletes. Undiagnosed or inappropriately treated asthma and/or allergy are common findings in clinical assessments of elite athletes experiencing recurrent URS. High‐performance athletes with recurrent episodes of URS should undergo a thorough clinical assessment to exclude underlying treatable conditions of respiratory inflammation. Identifying athletes at risk of recurrent URS is important in order to prescribe preventative clinical, training and lifestyle strategies. Monitoring secretion rates and falling concentrations of salivary IgA can identify athletes at risk of URS. Therapeutic interventions are limited by the uncertainty of the underlying cause of inflammation. Topical anti‐inflammatory sprays can be beneficial for some athletes. Dietary supplementation with bovine colostrum, probiotics and selected antioxidants can reduce the incidence or severity of URS in some athletes. Preliminary studies on athletes prone to URS indicate a genetic predisposition to a pro‐inflammatory response and a dysregulated anti‐inflammatory cytokine response to intense exercise as a possible mechanism of respiratory inflammation. This review focuses on respiratory infections and inflammation in elite/professional athletes.","Gleeson, Maree; Pyne, David B",Immunol Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165758/,8
10018,Characterization of an animal model of metastatic colon carcinoma,2006-07-17,"Summary: T‐cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice provide the ability to follow the maturation and fate of T cells specific for self‐antigens in vivo. This technology represents a major breakthrough in the study of autoimmune diseases in which specific antigens have been implicated. Proteins expressed within the central nervous system are believed to be important autoantigens in multiple sclerosis, TCR transgenic models specific for myelin basic protein (MBP) allowed us to assess the role of tolerance in providing protection from T cells with this specificity Our studies demonstrate that T cells specific for the immunodominant epitope of MBP do not undergo tolerance in vivo and that TCR transgenic mice are susceptible to spontaneous autoimmune disease. The susceptibility to spontaneous disease is dependent on exposure to microbial antigens, MBP TCR transgenic models expressing TCRs specific for the same epitope of MBP but utilizing different V(α) genes exhibit differing susceptibilities to, spontaneous disease. These data support the idea that genetic and environmental differences play a role in susceptibility to autoimmunity MBP TCR transgenic models are playing an important role in defining mechanisms by which infectious agents trigger autoimmune disease as well as defining mechanisms by which tolerance is induced to distinct epitopes within self‐antigens.","Goverman, Joan",Immunol Rev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7165877/,8

However, other techniques, which present different advantages, can also be used for this purpose. In this paper, we focus on high angle annular dark field (HAADF) in TEM and scanning TEM (STEM) in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging modes. The mentioned techniques will be first described, then compared to more conventional ones for the measurement of carbides size distribution in two FeCV and FeCVNb model alloys. This comparative study shows that STEM in SEM, a technique much easier to undertake compared to TEM, is perfectly adapted for size distribution measurements of second phase particles, with sizes ranging between 5 and 200 nm in these systems.","ACEVEDO‐REYES, D.; PEREZ, M.; VERDU, C.; BOGNER, A.; EPICIER, T.",J Microsc,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7166790/,8

The objective of this study was to determine the bacterial colonization of jawbone and identify the bacterial phylotypes associated with BRONJ. Materials and methods: Culture‐independent 16S rRNA gene‐based molecular techniques were used to determine and compare the total bacterial diversity in bone samples collected from 12 patients with cancer (six, BRONJ with history of BP; six, controls without BRONJ, no history of BP but have infection). Results: Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis profile and Dice coefficient displayed a statistically significant clustering of profiles, indicating different bacterial population in BRONJ subjects and control. The top three genera ranked among the BRONJ group were Streptococcus (29%), Eubacterium (9%), and Pseudoramibacter (8%), while in the control group were Parvimonas (17%), Streptococcus (15%), and Fusobacterium (15%). H&E sections of BRONJ bone revealed layers of bacteria along the surfaces and often are packed into the scalloped edges of the bone. Conclusion: This study using limited sample size indicated that the jawbone associated with BRONJ was heavily colonized by specific oral bacteria and there were apparent differences between the microbiota of BRONJ and controls.","Wei, X; Pushalkar, S; Estilo, C; Wong, C; Farooki, A; Fornier, M; Bohle, G; Huryn, J; Li, Y; Doty, S; Saxena, D",Oral Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7167636/,8

10638,"Immunoglobulin G, A, and M Light Chain Ratios in some Humoral Immunological Disorders",2006-06-29,"INTRODUCTION: Bedside nurse (RN) presence during family-centered rounds (FCR) enhances communication and collaboration for safer, higher-quality care.1–3 At our institution, RN participation in FCR was variable and lower than desired. The content discussed at each bedside during rounds was inconsistent, contributing to the irregular achievement of established FCR checklist items. METHODS: Using a scheduling tool with a prioritization algorithm and set time allotment/patient, we implemented schedule-based family-centered rounds (SBFCR) on a pediatric acute care unit. Primary outcome metrics included RN attendance and participation. We tracked rounding checklist compliance, parent presence on rounds, and adherence to the schedule. Surveys provided information on provider and family satisfaction. Perceived impact on teaching was the balancing measure because the structure discouraged spending extra time at the cost of team tardiness for the next patient. RESULTS: We created a schedule for 95% workweek days, with the rounding order kept for 93%. Mean RN attendance increased from 69% to 87% and participation increased from 48% to 80% with SBFCR (P < 0.001 for each). FCR checklist compliance increased from 60% to 94% (P < 0.001). Families felt more informed and able to attend; their presence at rounds rose from 66% to 85% (P < 0.001). Most faculty and trainees felt SBFCR was efficient and observed increased teaching with SBFCR. CONCLUSIONS: SBFCR provides an organizational framework for increased RN attendance and participation as well as greater family presence during rounds. The system elevated provider satisfaction with rounding without degrading the perceived educational experience.","Kipps, Alaina K.; Albert, Marisa S.; Bomher, Sean; Cheung, Shirley; Feehan, Shannon; Kim, Joseph",Pediatr Qual Saf,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7190241/,8
10740,Pathogenic variants in CDC45 on the remaining allele in patients with a chromosome 22q11.2 deletion result in a novel autosomal recessive condition,2019-09-02,"BACKGROUND: Electronic cigarettes/e-cigarettes (ECs), or vaping, is currently the most popular form of smoking amongst youth in the United States. ECs are battery-powered devices that vaporize a liquid that comes in small cartridges, or pods, that contain various chemicals, nicotine, and an array of flavors that can be modified to include cannabinoids (THC). With increasing popularity, however, there is an epidemic of pulmonary and gastrointestinal illnesses associated with vaping in the continental U.S.A. METHODS: We analyzed medical charts of three patients who were active users of ECs and presented with pneumonitis to our community medical center between January and August 2019. RESULTS: We report three cases of vaping pneumonitis in young adults, ages 18 to 21, who presented with similar symptoms, profiles, imaging studies, and disease progression. The average length of stay was approximately one week, and all patients had an extensive work-up in addition to a relapsing and remitting course of their condition. CONCLUSIONS: Early recognition and diagnosis of vaping pneumonitis are essential in the treatment of the ongoing epidemic. Extensive unnecessary work up may lead to increased healthcare costs. Our case series echoes the concerns of the CDC such that ECs should be avoided, and those with any pulmonary or gastrointestinal symptoms should seek medical attention promptly.","Silverman, Andrew L.; Siddique, Haseeb; Kumar, Vikas; Le, Thuy-Hong; Ng, Joseph",BMC Pulm Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7197363/,8

In this study, we determined the full-genome sequence of CMC718, a newly isolated EV71 strain in Korea. The CMC718 genome was 7,415 nucleotides in length and was confirmed by whole-genome phylogenetic analysis to belong to the B5 genotype. In particular, CMC718 demonstrated maximum identity with strain M988 of the B5 genotype and numerous amino acid variants were detected in the 3D domain of the viral protein P3, which is consistent with the mutation pattern of a B5 strain isolated in 2012–2013. Comparison of the CMC718 sequence with other EV71 reference strains confirmed the relationship and genetic variation of CMC718. Our study was a full-genome sequence analysis of the first EV71 strain of the B5 genotype isolated in South Korea. This information will be a valuable reference for the development of methods for the detection of recombinant viruses, the tracking of infections, and the diagnosis of EV71.","Won, Yu Jung; Kang, Lae Hyung; Lee, Ah Ra; Paik, Bomina; Kim, Hyun; Lee, Sung Geun; Park, Seung Won; Hong, Seung Jin; Paik, Soon Young",J Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223378/,8

A critical question is whether enough new antibacterial drugs are being discovered and developed. A review of the clinical antibacterial drug pipeline was recently published, but comprehensive information about the global preclinical pipeline is unavailable. This Review focuses on discovery and preclinical development projects and has found, as of 1 May 2019, 407 antibacterial projects from 314 institutions. The focus is on Gram-negative pathogens, particularly bacteria on the WHO priority bacteria list. The preclinical pipeline is characterized by high levels of diversity and interesting scientific concepts, with 135 projects on direct-acting small molecules that represent new classes, new targets or new mechanisms of action. There is also a strong trend towards non-traditional approaches, including diverse antivirulence approaches, microbiome-modifying strategies, and engineered phages and probiotics. The high number of pathogen-specific and adjunctive approaches is unprecedented in antibiotic history. Translational hurdles are not adequately addressed yet, especially development pathways to show clinical impact of non-traditional approaches. The innovative potential of the preclinical pipeline compared with the clinical pipeline is encouraging but fragile. Much more work, focus and funding are needed for the novel approaches to result in effective antibacterial therapies to sustainably combat antibacterial resistance.","Theuretzbacher, Ursula; Outterson, Kevin; Engel, Aleks; Karlén, Anders",Nat Rev Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7223541/,8

We review each element of the ICU liberation bundle, including pediatric support data, as well as tips and strategies for implementation in a pediatric ICU (PICU) setting. RECENT FINDINGS: Numerous studies have found children have cognitive, physical, and psychiatric deficits after a PICU stay. The effects of the full ICU liberation bundle in children have not been published, but in adults, bundle implementation (even partial) resulted in significant improvement in survival, mechanical ventilation use, coma, delirium, restraint-free care, ICU readmissions, and post-ICU discharge disposition. SUMMARY: Although initially described in adults, children also suffer from PICS. The ICU liberation bundle is feasible in children and may ameliorate the effects of a PICU stay. Further studies are needed to characterize the benefits of the ICU liberation bundle in children.","Walz, Alice; Canter, Marguerite Orsi; Betters, Kristina",Curr Pediatr Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7229434/,8

The licensed enterovirus vaccines and those currently in clinical development are traditional inactivated or live attenuated vaccines. Even though these vaccines work well in the prevention of enterovirus diseases, new vaccine technologies, like virus-like particles (VLPs), can offer important advantages in the manufacturing and epitope engineering. We have previously produced VLPs for CVB3 and CVB1 in insect cells. Here, we describe the production of CVB3-VLPs with enhanced production yield and purity using an improved purification method consisting of tangential flow filtration and ion exchange chromatography, which is compatible with industrial scale production. We also resolved the CVB3-VLP structure by Cryo-Electron Microscopy imaging and single particle reconstruction. The VLP diameter is 30.9 nm on average, and it is similar to Coxsackievirus A VLPs and the expanded enterovirus cell-entry intermediate (the 135s particle), which is ~2 nm larger than the mature virion. High neutralizing and total IgG antibody levels, the latter being a predominantly Th2 type (IgG1) phenotype, were detected in C57BL/6J mice immunized with non-adjuvanted CVB3-VLP vaccine.

Amongst the involved viruses, the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and the swine influenza type A virus (swIAV) have a major impact. These viruses frequently encounter and dual infections are reported. We analyzed here the molecular interactions between viruses and porcine tracheal epithelial cells as well as lung tissue. PRRSV-1 species do not infect porcine respiratory epithelial cells. However, PRRSV-1, when inoculated simultaneously or shortly before swIAV, was able to inhibit swIAV H1N2 infection, modulate the interferon response and alter signaling protein phosphorylations (ERK, AKT, AMPK, and JAK2), in our conditions. SwIAV inhibition was also observed, although at a lower level, by inactivated PRRSV-1, whereas acid wash treatment inactivating non-penetrated viruses suppressed the interference effect. PRRSV-1 and swIAV may interact at several stages, before their attachment to the cells, when they attach to their receptors, and later on. In conclusion, we showed for the first time that PRRSV can alter the relation between swIAV and its main target cells, opening the doors to further studies on the interplay between viruses.

To improve uptake and sustain consumer engagement, mobile health interventions need to be responsive to individuals’ needs and preferences, which may change over time. We previously created an ecological daily needs assessment to capture microprocesses influencing user needs and preferences for mobile health treatment adaptation. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to test the utility of a needs assessment anchored within a mobile app to capture individualized, contextually relevant user needs and preferences within the framework of a weight management mobile health app. METHODS: Participants with an iOS device could download the study app via the study website or links from social media. In this fully remote study, we screened, obtained informed consent from, and enrolled participants through the mobile app. The mobile health framework included daily health goal setting and self-monitoring, with up to 6 daily prompts to determine in-the-moment needs and preferences for mobile health–assisted health behavior change. RESULTS: A total of 24 participants downloaded the app and provided e-consent (22 female; 2 male), with 23 participants responding to at least one prompt over 2 weeks. The mean length of engagement was 5.6 (SD 4.7) days, with a mean of 2.8 (1.1) responses per day.

Qualitative feedback indicated preferences for self-adapting features, simplified self-monitoring, and the ability to personalize app-generated message timing and content. CONCLUSIONS: The technique provided an individually dynamic and contextually relevant alternative and complement to traditional needs assessment for assessing individually dynamic user needs and preferences during treatment development or adaptation. The results of this utility study suggest the importance of personalization and learning algorithms for sustaining app engagement in young adults with psychiatric conditions. Further study in broader user populations is needed.","Nicol, Ginger E; Ricchio, Amanda R; Metts, Christopher L; Yingling, Michael D; Ramsey, Alex T; Schweiger, Julia A; Miller, J Philip; Lenze, Eric J",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7695533/,8
14469,Optogenetic control of gut bacterial metabolism to promote longevity,2020-12-16,"IMPORTANCE: An end-to-end efficacy evaluation approach for identifying progression risk after epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)–tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in patients with stage IV EGFR variant–positive non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is lacking. OBJECTIVE: To propose a clinically applicable large-scale bidirectional generative adversarial network for predicting the efficacy of EGFR-TKI therapy in patients with NSCLC. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This diagnostic/prognostic study enrolled 465 patients from January 1, 2010, to August 1, 2017, with follow-up from February 1, 2010, to June 1, 2020. A deep learning (DL) semantic signature to predict progression-free survival (PFS) was constructed in the training cohort, validated in 2 external validation and 2 control cohorts, and compared with the radiomics signature. EXPOSURES: An end-to-end bidirectional generative adversarial network framework was designed to predict the progression risk in patients with NSCLC. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary end point was PFS, considering the time from the initiation of therapy to the date of recurrence, confirmed disease progression, or death. RESULTS: A total of 342 patients with stage IV EGFR variant–positive NSCLC receiving EGFR-TKI therapy met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 145 patients from 2 of the hospitals (n = 117 and 28) formed a training cohort (mean [SD] age, 61 [11] years; 87 [60.0%] female), and the patients from 2 other hospitals comprised 2 external validation cohorts (validation cohort 1: n = 101; mean [SD] age, 57 [12] years; 60 [59.4%] female; and validation cohort 2: n = 96, mean [SD] age, 58 [9] years; 55 [57.3%] female). Fifty-six patients with advanced-stage EGFR variant–positive NSCLC (mean [SD] age, 52 [11] years; 26 [46.4%] female) and 67 patients with advanced-stage EGFR wild-type NSCLC (mean [SD] age, 54 [10] years; 10 [15.0%] female) who received first-line chemotherapy were included. A total of 90 (26%) receiving EGFR-TKI therapy with a high risk of rapid disease progression were identified (median [range] PFS, 7.3 [1.4-32.0] months in the training cohort, 5.0 [0.6-34.6] months in validation cohort 1, and 6.4 [1.8-20.1] months, in validation cohort 2) using the DL semantic signature.The PFS decreased by 36% (hazard ratio, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.30-3.49; P < .001) compared with that in other patients (median [range] PFS, 11.5 [1.5-64.2] months in the training cohort, 10.9 [1.1-50.5] in validation cohort 1, and 8.9 [0.8-40.6] months in validation cohort 2. No significant differences were observed when comparing the PFS of high-risk patients receiving EGFR-TKI therapy with the chemotherapy cohorts (median PFS, 6.9 vs 4.4 months; P = .08). In terms of predicting the tumor progression risk after EGFR-TKI therapy, clinical decisions based on the DL semantic signature led to better survival outcomes than those based on radiomics signature across all risk probabilities by the decision curve analysis. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This diagnostic/prognostic study provides a clinically applicable approach for identifying patients with stage IV EGFR variant–positive NSCLC who are not likely to benefit from EGFR-TKI therapy. The end-to-end DL-derived semantic features eliminated all manual interventions required while using previous radiomics methods and have a better prognostic performance.","Song, Jiangdian; Wang, Lu; Ng, Nathan Norton; Zhao, Mingfang; Shi, Jingyun; Wu, Ning; Li, Weimin; Liu, Zaiyi; Yeom, Kristen W.; Tian, Jie",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7747022/,8

The adaptability of this opportunistic pathogen has hampered the development of antimicrobial therapies, and consequently, it remains a major threat to public health. Due to its antimicrobial resistance, vaccines represent an alternative strategy to tackle the pathogen, yet despite over 50 years of research on anti-Pseudomonas vaccines, no vaccine has been licensed. Nevertheless, there have been many advances in this field, including a better understanding of the host immune response and the biology of P. aeruginosa. Multiple antigens and adjuvants have been investigated with varying results. Although the most effective protective response remains to be established, it is clear that a polarised Th2 response is sub-optimal, and a mixed Th1/Th2 or Th1/Th17 response appears beneficial. This comprehensive review collates the current understanding of the complexities of P. aeruginosa-host interactions and its implication in vaccine design, with a view to understanding the current state of Pseudomonal vaccine development and the direction of future efforts. It highlights the importance of the incorporation of appropriate adjuvants to the protective antigen to yield optimal protection.","Sainz-Mejías, Maite; Jurado-Martín, Irene; McClean, Siobhán",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7762141/,8

14577,Advances against Aspergillosis and Mucormycosis,2020-12-11,"BACKGROUND: Long-term side-effects associated with different prostate cancer treatment approaches are common. Sexual challenges are the most frequently occurring issues and can result in increased psychological morbidity. It is recognized that barriers to communication can make initiating discussions around sexual concerns in routine practice difficult. Health care professionals need to routinely initiate conversations, effectively engage with patients, and assess needs in order to provide essential support. One proposed method that could support health care professionals to do this involves the use of prompts or structured frameworks to guide conversations. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess feasibility, acceptability, and satisfaction with the tablet-based Engagement, Assessment, Support, and Sign-posting (EASSi) tool designed to facilitate and structure sexual well-being discussions in routine prostate cancer care. METHODS: Health care professionals (n=8) used the EASSi tool during 89 posttreatment appointments. Quantitative data were recorded based on program usage and surveys completed by health care professionals and patients. Qualitative data exploring perceptions on use of the tool were gathered using semistructured interviews with all health care professionals (n=8) and a sample of patients (n=10). RESULTS: Surveys were completed by health care professionals immediately following each appointment (n=89, 100%). Postal surveys were returned by 59 patients (66%). Health care professionals and patients reported that the tool helped facilitate discussions (81/89, 91% and 50/59, 85%, respectively) and that information provided was relevant (82/89, 92% and 50/59, 85%, respectively). The mean conversation duration was 6.01 minutes (SD 2.91). Qualitative synthesis identified the tool’s ability to initiate and structure discussions, improve the “depth” of conversations, and normalize sexual concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The EASSi tool was appropriate and acceptable for use in practice and provided a flexible approach to facilitate routine brief conversations and deliver essential sexual well-being support. Further work will be conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of using the tablet-based tool in prostate cancer care settings.","McCaughan, Eilís; Flannagan, Carrie; Parahoo, Kader; Connaghan, John; Maguire, Roma; Steele, Mary; Thompson, Samantha; Jain, Suneil; Kirby, Michael; Brady, Nuala; O'Connor, Seán R",JMIR Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7748949/,8
14849,"Role of Gut Microbiota and Their Metabolites on Atherosclerosis, Hypertension and Human Blood Platelet Function: A Review",2021-01-03,"Workplace violence is a prevalent phenomenon in healthcare, particularly among nursing professionals. Exposure to workplace violence may be direct through firsthand involvement, indirect through secondhand witnessing, or both. Even though implications for victims of workplace violence have been well-studied, less is known about the various types of exposure and their effects on nurse mental health. The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of workplace-violence exposure types on the mental health of nurses, while accounting for the intensity of the incident/s. This study employs an exploratory correlational design with survey methods. Nurses from British Columbia (BC), Canada, were invited by the provincial nurses’ union to complete an electronic survey in Fall 2019. A total of 2958 responses from direct-care nurses in acute-care settings were analyzed using logistic regression. The results showed that mental-health problems increased with cumulative exposure; even though nurses with solely indirect exposure to workplace violence did not report greater mental-health problems, those experiencing solely direct exposure, or both direct and indirect exposure, were two to four times more likely to report high levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, depression and burnout compared to their counterparts with no exposure. There is an urgent need for better mental-health support, prevention policies and practices that take into account the type of workplace-violence exposure.","Havaei, Farinaz",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7824770/,8
14949,Epigenetic modification and a role for the E3 ligase RNF40 in cancer development and metastasis,2020-11-16,"Background: The papaya mosaic virus (PapMV) vaccine platform is a rod-shaped nanoparticle made of the recombinant PapMV coat protein (CP) self-assembled around a noncoding single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) template. The PapMV nanoparticle induces innate immunity through stimulation of the Toll-like receptors (TLR) 7 and 8. The display of the vaccine antigen at the surface of the nanoparticle, associated with the co-stimulation signal via TLR7/8, ensures a strong stimulation of the immune response, which is ideal for the development of candidate vaccines. In this study, we assess the impact of where the peptide antigen is fused, whether at the surface or at the extremities of the nanoparticles, on the immune response directed to that antigen. Methods: Two different peptides from influenza A virus were used as model antigens. The conserved M2e peptide, derived from the matrix protein 2 was chosen as the B-cell epitope, and a peptide derived from the nucleocapsid was chosen as the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) epitope. These peptides were coupled at two different positions on the PapMV CP, the N- (PapMV-N) or the C-terminus (PapMV-C), using the transpeptidase activity of Sortase A (SrtA). The immune responses, both humoral and CD8+ T-cell-mediated, directed to the peptide antigens in the two different fusion contexts were analyzed and compared. The impact of coupling density at the surface of the nanoparticle was also investigated. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that coupling of the peptide antigens at the N-terminus (PapMV-N) of the PapMV CP led to an enhanced immune response to the coupled peptide antigens as compared to coupling to the C-terminus. The difference between the two vaccine platforms is linked to the enhanced capacity of the PapMV-N vaccine platform to stimulate TLR7/8. We also demonstrated that the strength of the immune response increases with the density of coupling at the surface of the nanoparticles.","Laliberté-Gagné, Marie-Eve; Bolduc, Marilène; Garneau, Caroline; Olivera-Ugarte, Santa-Mariela; Savard, Pierre; Leclerc, Denis",Vaccines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7829862/,8

CTE is often accompanied by neuropsychiatric symptoms, which could escalate to suicidal ideation (SI) and suicidal behaviour (SB). Nevertheless, fairly limited emphasis about the association between suicidality and CTE exists in medical literature. Here, we report two cases of retired professional athletes in high contact sports (boxing and ice hockey) who have developed similar clinical trajectories characterized by progressive neuropsychiatric symptoms compatible with a CTE diagnosis and subsequent SB in its severe forms (medical serious suicide attempt (SA) and completed suicide). In addition to the description of outlining clinical, neuropsychological, neuroimaging, and differential diagnosis elements related to these cases, we also hypothesized some mechanisms that might augment the suicide risk in CTE. They include those related to neurobiological (neuroanatomic/neuroinflammatory) dysfunctions as well as those pertaining to psychiatry and psychosocial maladaptation to neurotraumas and retirement from professional competitive activity. Findings described here can provide clinical pictures to improve the identification of patients with CTE and also potential mechanistic insights to refine the knowledge of eventual severe SB development, which might enable its earlier prevention.","Costanza, Alessandra; Radomska, Michalina; Zenga, Francesco; Amerio, Andrea; Aguglia, Andrea; Serafini, Gianluca; Amore, Mario; Berardelli, Isabella; Ojio, Yasutaka; Nguyen, Khoa D.",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7908343/,8

15687,The Lanostane Triterpenoids in Poria cocos Play Beneficial Roles in Immunoregulatory Activity,2021-02-01,"Measles incidence in the United States has grown dramatically, as vaccination rates are declining and transmission internationally is on the rise. Because imported cases are necessary drivers of outbreaks in non-endemic settings, predicting measles outbreaks in the US depends on predicting imported cases. To assess the predictability of imported measles cases, we performed a regression of imported measles cases in the US against an inflow variable that combines air travel data with international measles surveillance data. To understand the contribution of each data type to these predictions, we repeated the regression analysis with alternative versions of the inflow variable that replaced each data type with averaged values and with versions of the inflow variable that used modeled inputs. We assessed the performance of these regression models using correlation, coverage probability, and area under the curve statistics, including with resampling and cross-validation. Our regression model had good predictive ability with respect to the presence or absence of imported cases in a given state in a given year (area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.78) and the magnitude of imported cases (Pearson correlation = 0.84). By comparing alternative versions of the inflow variable averaging over different inputs, we found that both air travel data and international surveillance data contribute to the model’s ability to predict numbers of imported cases and individually contribute to its ability to predict the presence or absence of imported cases. Predicted sources of imported measles cases varied considerably across years and US states, depending on which countries had high measles activity in a given year. Our results emphasize the importance of the relationship between global connectedness and the spread of measles. This study provides a framework for predicting and understanding imported case dynamics that could inform future studies and outbreak prevention efforts.","Poterek, Marya L.; Kraemer, Moritz U.

Here we sought to clarify the feasibility and utility of clinical sequencing in the treatment of refractory tumors at our hospital. METHODS: A total of 39 patients with advanced solid tumors treated at our hospital between 2018 and 2020 were enrolled in the clinical sequencing. Among them, we identified 36 patients whose tissue samples were of suitable quality for clinical sequencing, and we analyzed the genomic profiles of these tumors. RESULTS: Pathogenic alterations were detected in 28 (78%) of the 36 patients. The most common mutation was TP53 (55%), followed by KRAS (22%), and the highest frequency of gene amplification was ERBB2 (17%). Nine of the 36 patients were identified as candidates for novel molecular-targeted therapy based on their actionable gene alterations, but only one case ended up receiving novel targeted therapy following the genetic tests. CONCLUSIONS: Our current results suggested that clinical sequencing might be useful for the detection of pathogenic alterations and the management of additional cancer treatment. However, molecular target based on actionable genomic alteration does not always bridge to subsequent therapy due to clinical deterioration, refusal for unapproved drug, and complexity of clinical trial access. Both improved optimal timing of clinical sequencing and a consensus about its off-label use might help patients receive greater benefit from clinical sequencing.","Nishimura, Sadaaki; Sugimoto, Atsushi; Kushiyama, Shuhei; Togano, Shingo; Kuroda, Kenji; Yamamoto, Yurie; Yamauchi, Makoto; Sumi, Toshiyuki; Kaneda, Hiroyasu; Kawaguchi, Tomoya; Kato, Minoru; Tagami, Mizuki; Oebisu, Naoto; Hoshi, Manabu; Kimura, Kenjiro; Kubo, Shoji; Muguruma, Kazuya; Takashima, Tsutomu; Ohira, Masaichi; Yashiro, Masakazu",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7909652/,8

Medical records were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Among the 700 neonates with NARDS who needed invasive ventilation, 501 (71.6%) received CMV, while 199 (28.4%) received HFOV. One-to-one propensity score matching (127:127) was used to match the baseline characteristics of patients who received CMV and HFOV. The results showed that birth weight and oxygenation index (OI) were independently associated with mortality in the multivariate logistic regression. No significant differences were observed in mortality or the incidence of BPD between the two groups. The incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and ventilation-free days were significantly lower in the HFOV group than in the CMV group (3.9 vs 11.80%, p=0.02; 15.226 vs 20.967 days, p=0.01). There were no significant differences between the two groups regarding other secondary outcomes. Conclusion: HFOV was associated with a decreased incidence of IVH in infants with NARDS compared with CMV. However, there were significantly more VFDs in the CMV group than in the HFOV group, and HFOV did not appear to be superior to CMV in decreasing the mortality and incidence of BPD in infants with NARDS.","Liu, Kaizhen; Chen, Long; Xiong, Jing; Xie, Shuqin; Hu, Yuan; Shi, Yuan",Eur J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7910198/,8

16309,The Tree Shrew as a Model for Cancer Research,2021-03-09,"BACKGROUND: Ascaris lumbricoides is the most common causative agent of soil-transmitted helminth infections worldwide, with an estimated 450 million people infected with this nematode globally. It is suggested that helminths are capable of evading and manipulating the host immune system through the release of a spectrum of worm proteins which underpins their long-term survival in the host. We hypothesise that the worm overexpresses these proteins when infecting adults compared to children to cirvumvent the more robust defence mechanisms of adults. However, little is known about the parasite’s genes and encoded proteins involved during A. lumbricoides infection. Hence, this study was conducted to assess the expression profile of putative virulence-associated genes during an active infection of adults and children. METHODS: In this study, quantitative PCR was performed to evaluate the expression profile of putative virulence-associated genes in A. lumbricoides isolated from infected children and adults. The study was initiated by collecting adult worms expelled from adults and children following anthelminthic treatment. High-quality RNA was successfully extracted from each of six adult worms expelled by three adults and three children, respectively. Eleven putative homologues of helminth virulence-associated genes reported in previous studies were selected, primers were designed and specific amplicons of A. lumbricoides genes were noted. The expression profiles of these putative virulence-associated genes in A. lumbricoides from infected adults were compared to those in A. lumbricoides from infected children. RESULTS: The putative virulence-associated genes VENOM, CADHERIN and PEBP were significantly upregulated at 166-fold, 13-fold and fivefold, respectively, in adults compared to children. Conversely, the transcription of ABA-1 (fourfold), CATH-L (threefold) and INTEGRIN (twofold) was significantly suppressed in A. lumbricoides from infected adults. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the expression profile of the putative virulence-associated genes, we propose that the encoded proteins have potential roles in evasion mechanisms, which could guide the development of therapeutic interventions.

Preservation of PM integrity and transport function is the key to the success of PD therapy, particularly in the long term, since the prolonged exposure to unphysiological hypertonic glucose-based PD solutions in current use is detrimental to the PM, with progressive loss of peritoneal ultrafiltration capacity causing technique failure. Moreover, absorbing too much glucose intraperitoneally from the dialysate may give rise to a number of systemic metabolic effects. Here we report the preliminary results of the first clinical experience based on the use in continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) patients of novel PD solutions obtained through partly replacing the glucose load with other osmotically active metabolites, such as L-carnitine and xylitol. Ten CAPD patients were treated for four weeks with the new solutions. There was good tolerance to the experimental PD solutions, and no adverse safety signals were observed. Parameters of dialysis efficiency including creatinine clearance and urea Kt/V proved to be stable as well as fluid status, diuresis, and total peritoneal ultrafiltration. The promising tolerance and local/systemic advantages of using L-carnitine and xylitol in the PD solution merit further research.","Rago, Carmela; Lombardi, Teresa; Di Fulvio, Giorgia; Di Liberato, Lorenzo; Arduini, Arduino; Divino-Filho, José C.; Bonomini, Mario",Toxins (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7996173/,8

This study aimed to explore the molecular endocytic pathways involved in the protective ILA effect against inflammation. H4 cells, Caco-2 cells, C57BL/6 pup and adult mice were used to compare the anti-inflammatory mechanisms between immature and mature enterocytes in vitro and in vivo. The results show that ILA has pleiotropic protective effects on immature enterocytes including anti-inflammatory, anti-viral, and developmental regulatory potentials in a region-dependent and an age-dependent manner. Quantitative transcriptomic analysis revealed a new mechanistic model in which STAT1 pathways play an important role in IL-1β-induced inflammation and ILA has a regulatory effect on STAT1 pathways. These studies were validated by real-time RT-qPCR and STAT1 inhibitor experiments. Different protective reactions of ILA between immature and mature enterocytes indicated that ILA’s effects are developmentally regulated.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neutrophils, CSF lymphocytes, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), blood albumin, blood C-reactive protein (CRP), glucose, blood soluble urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), and CSF lymphocytes-to-blood CRP ratio (LCR) were used as predictors for the ML algorithms. The performance of the ML algorithms was evaluated through a cross-validation procedure, and optimal predictions of the type of meningitis were above 95% for viral and 78% for bacterial meningitis. Overall, MLR and RF yielded the best performance when using CSF neutrophils, CSF lymphocytes, NLR, albumin, glucose, gender, and CRP. Also, our results reconfirm the high diagnostic accuracy of NLR in the differential diagnosis between bacterial and viral meningitis.","Mentis, Alexios-Fotios A.; Garcia, Irene; Jiménez, Juan; Paparoupa, Maria; Xirogianni, Athanasia; Papandreou, Anastasia; Tzanakaki, Georgina",Diagnostics (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8065596/,8

Several novel antibiotics have been approved in the past decade to combat these infections; however, physicians may be unfamiliar with how to appropriately utilize them. The purpose of this review is to evaluate novel antibiotics active against resistant gram-negative bacteria and highlight clinical information regarding their use in the acute care setting. This review focuses on novel antibiotics useful in the treatment of infections caused by resistant gram-negative organisms that may be seen in the acute care setting. These novel antibiotics include ceftolozane/tazobactam, ceftazidime/avibactam, meropenem/vaborbactam, imipenem/cilistatin/relebactam, cefiderocol, plazomicin, eravacycline, and omadacycline.

The in vivo septic models and in vitro septic model were established. In animal models, the lung injury of the rats was evaluated after XIST was overexpressed. In cell models, the effects of XIST and microRNA (miR)-16-5p on ALI was detected by MTT assay, Western blot and ELISA. The interaction between XIST and miR-16-5p was investigated by bioinformatics analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assay, RIP assay and RNA pull-down assay. We found that XIST expression was down-regulated in lung tissues of septic rats and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated cells, while the expression of miR-16-5p was up-regulated. Down-regulation of XIST significantly promoted pulmonary edema, increased the levels of TNF-α, IL-1β and malondialdehyde, inhibited the cell viability and decreased the level of superoxide dismutase. Mechanistically, it was confirmed that XIST could sponge miR-16-5p, and thus repress its expression, and the transfection of miR-16-5p mimics could reverse the effects of XIST over-expression in the cell model. Collectively, it is concluded that XIST reduces sepsis-induced ALI via regulating miR-16-5p.","Song, Xiaofei; Li, Linyu; Zhao, Yaying; Song, Yucheng",Hum Cell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8114023/,8

The State of West Bengal is uniquely positioned with its innate geographical vulnerabilities that favour outbreaks of a host of infectious diseases. The northern districts of this State are well known endemic areas for many outbreak prone communicable diseases like malaria, Japanese encephalitis, scrub typhus, dengue and kala-azar. An outbreak of Nipah virus in the recent past is a pointer towards the emerging and re-emerging threat in these regions and warrants urgent prioritization for surveillance and monitoring of these diseases. Identification of risk factors, challenges in delivery of primary healthcare, implementation of intervention strategies along with strengthening of healthcare setup are also the need of the hour.

Here, we report the generation of an expandable, 3D branching ureteric bud (UB) organoid culture model that can be derived from primary UB progenitors from mouse and human fetal kidneys, or generated de novo from human pluripotent stem cells. In chemically-defined culture conditions, UB organoids generate CD organoids, with differentiated principal and intercalated cells adopting spatial assemblies reflective of the adult kidney’s collecting system. Aggregating 3D-cultured nephron progenitor cells with UB organoids in vitro results in a reiterative process of branching morphogenesis and nephron induction, similar to kidney development. Applying an efficient gene editing strategy to remove RET activity, we demonstrate genetically modified UB organoids can model congenital anomalies of kidney and urinary tract. Taken together, these platforms will facilitate an enhanced understanding of development, regeneration and diseases of the mammalian collecting duct system.","Zeng, Zipeng; Huang, Biao; Parvez, Riana K.; Li, Yidan; Chen, Jyunhao; Vonk, Ariel C.; Thornton, Matthew E.; Patel, Tadrushi; Rutledge, Elisabeth A.; Kim, Albert D.; Yu, Jingying; Grubbs, Brendan H.; McMahon, Jill A.; Pastor-Soler, Nuria M.; Hallows, Kenneth R.; McMahon, Andrew P.; Li, Zhongwei",Nat Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8206157/,8
18656,The plasma peptides of Alzheimer’s disease,2021-06-28,"Liver biopsy is crucial for the diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), and new reproducible histological criteria would be highly desirable, especially in acute-on-chronic cases. The aims of the present study were (i) to evaluate the AIH histopathological criteria as a function of the time and modality of AIH onset, and (ii) to validate the count of apoptotic bodies in the portal tracts as a histopathological criterion for AIH diagnosis. Sixty-five patients were retrospectively enrolled: 20 underwent biopsy for the first diagnosis and 45 had a previous histological AIH diagnosis. Biopsies were revised, and all histological variables were collected, including the lymphocytic apoptotic bodies in the portal tracts. Clinical and serological data were revised as well. First-diagnosis patients showed a higher grade of inflammation (p = 0.001), but also worse portal fibrosis (p = 0.001). The apoptotic body count was higher in first-diagnosis patients than in follow-up patients (p = 0.002), and it was strongly correlated to inflammation. Using the apoptotic body count among the simplified AIH score variables, the first-biopsy patients in the “definite” category rose from 42 to 68%. Our results confirm the histopathological criteria proposed by the literature and introduce the count of portal apoptotic bodies for the diagnosis of active AIH, especially in first biopsies without other classic features, as well as in AIH diagnostic score, albeit future studies are required to find a definite cutoff.","Franceschini, Tania; Vasuri, Francesco; Muratori, Paolo; Muratori, Luigi; Guido, Maria; Lenzi, Marco; D’Errico, Antonia",Virchows Arch,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8241564/,8
18766,The role of viruses in the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease,2020-11-27,"AIM: The incidence of ulcerative colitis (UC) is increasing steadily in developed countries, it is plaguing nearly 1 million people in the United States and European countries, while developing countries have had a rapidly increased incidence over the past decades. Curcuma is widely used in treating malaria, UC, Crohn's disease, and colon cancer, which lead to diarrhea and bloody stool. However, the systemic mechanism of curcuma in treating UC is still unclear. Our work was supposed to expound how does curcuma alleviate UC in a comprehensive and systematic way by network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experiment verification. METHODS: Traditional Chinese Medicine System Pharmacology Database (TCMSP), Shanghai Chemistry & Chemical Industry Data Platform (SGST), and papers published in Chinese Network Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and PubMed were used to collect the chemical constituents of curcuma based on ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion). And effective targets were predicted by Swiss Target Prediction to establish the curcuma-related database. The disease targets of UC were screened by GeneCards and DrugBank databases, and Wayne (Venn) analysis was carried out with curcuma targets to determine the intersection targets. AutoDock software and TCMNPAS system were used to dock the core chemical components of curcuma with key UC targets. Protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed based on the STRING database and Cytoscape software. Gene function GO analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were carried out by using Metascape database. Finally, HE staining was performed to identify the inflammatory infiltration and expression difference in TNF-α and STAT3 before and after the treatment of curcuma which was verified by immunoblotting. RESULTS: Twelve active components containing 148 target genes were selected from curcuma. Potential therapeutic targets of curcuma in the treatment of UC were acquired from 54 overlapped targets from UC and curcuma. Molecular docking was used to filter the exact 24 core proteins interacting with compounds whose docking energy is lower than −5.5 and stronger than that of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). GO and KEGG analyses showed that these targets were highly correlated with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, MAPK signaling pathway, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Experiments verified curcuma relieved pathological manifestation and decreased the expression of TNF-α and STAT3. CONCLUSION: Curcuma relieved the colon inflammation of ulcerative colitis via inactivating TNF pathway, inflammatory bowel disease pathway, and epithelial cell signaling in Helicobacter pylori infection pathway, probably by binding to STAT3 and TNF-α.","Liu, Suxian; Li, Qiaodong; Liu, Fengzhi; Cao, Hui; Liu, Jun; Shan, Jingyi; Dan, Wenchao; Yuan, Jianye; Lin, Jiang",Evid Based Complement Alternat Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8225429/,8
18936,Actions of Thyroid Hormones on Thyroid Cancers,2021-06-21,"BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma genitalium (MG) causes urogenital tract infections and is associated with reproductive morbidity. Although MG has been reported across many regions and population groups, it is not yet routinely tested for in China. Our study contributes to current research by reporting the prevalence and correlates of MG infection in patients attending a sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic in Guangdong from Jan 2017-May 2018. METHODS: Urethral (from 489 men) and endo-cervical (from 189 women) samples, blood samples, and patient histories (via questionnaires) were collected. Doctors clinically diagnosed anogenital warts (GW) during the examination (n = 678). The presence of MG was evaluated using an in-house via polymerase chain reaction protocol. We also tested all participants for herpes simplex virus-2 (HSV-2), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), syphilis and HIV. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to evaluate factors associated with MG. RESULTS: MG was detected in 7.2% (49/678) of the patients (men, 7.4%; women, 6.9%). The MG positivity rate was 14.2% among symptomatic patients, and 5.6% for asymptomatic patients, respectively. Only 36.7% (18/49) Mg positive patients were symptomatic. Among the MG-infected patients, 10.2% were co-infected with CT, 6.1% with NG, 8.2% with HSV-2, 4.1% with syphilis and 22.4% with GW. Presentation with clinical symptoms was significantly associated with MG infection [OR = 2.52 (2.03–3.13)]. In our analysis, MG was not associated with other STIs. CONCLUSIONS: MG is a relatively common infection among individuals attending an STI clinic in Guangdong Province. Routine testing of symptomatic patients may be necessary, and more epidemiological studies are needed to provide evidence for future testing guidelines.","Zhang, Xiao-Hui; Zhao, Pei-Zhen; Ke, Wu-Jian; Wang, Liu-Yuan; Tso, Lai Sze; Chen, Zheng-Yu; Liao, Yu-Ying; Liang, Chun-Mei; Chen, Hui-Ru; Ren, Xu-Qi; Huang, Jin-Mei; Ong, Jason J.; Yang, Fan; Yang, Li-Gang",BMC Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8256639/,8
18964,Missing Verification of Source Data in Hypertension Research: The HYGIA PROJECT in Perspective,2021-07-08,"IMPORTANCE: Characteristics of a health care system can facilitate forgoing of health care owing to economic reasons and can influence population health. Whether health insurance deductibles are associated with forgoing of health care in a consumer-driven health care system with universal coverage, such as the Swiss health system, remains to be determined. OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between insurance plan deductibles and forgoing of health care with consideration of socioeconomic factors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in Geneva, Switzerland, using data collected from January 1, 2007, to December 31, 2019. Population-based samples were obtained yearly through random stratified sampling by age and sex of the general population aged 20 to 74 years. Participants were invited to an appointment at 1 of the 3 study sites in Geneva, where they completed a sociodemographic and health questionnaire. EXPOSURES: Insurance plan deductible level. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was forgoing of health care owing to economic reasons. Unadjusted and multivariable Poisson models were used to assess the association between deductible level and forgoing of health care. Differences in forgoing health care across the range of health insurance deductibles or household income levels were quantified using the relative index of inequality (RII). RESULTS: The study group included 11 872 participants (5974 [50.3%] male; median age, 48.1 years [interquartile range, 38.7-59.1 years]); 1146 (9.7%) reported forgoing health care. Participants with high-deductible plans reported forgoing health care more frequently than those with low-deductible plans (331 [13.5%] vs 591 [8.7%]). In adjusted analysis, higher-deductible plans were associated with a greater likelihood of forgoing health care (RII, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.7-3.0; P < .001) independently of socioeconomic status, known comorbidities, and cardiovascular risk factors. Deductible level was associated with forgoing of health care among participants younger than 40 years (RII, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.6-4.0; P < .001) and those aged 40 to 64 years (RII, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.3-2.9; P = .002) but not among those older than 65 years (RII, 2.9; 95% CI, 0.8-10.4; P = .11). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cross-sectional study, high insurance plan deductibles were associated with forgoing of health care independent of socioeconomic status and preexisting conditions in a universal consumer-driven health care system with good population outcomes in Switzerland. Uncovering health care system design features that could lead to suboptimal population care may help decision makers improve their current health care system design to achieve better outcomes.","Sandoval, José Luis; Petrovic, Dusan; Guessous, Idris; Stringhini, Silvia",JAMA Netw Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8261614/,8
19116,Salt Transiently Inhibits Mitochondrial Energetics in Mononuclear Phagocytes,2021-04-28,"Infants look longer at impossible or unlikely events than at possible events. While these responses to expectancy violations have been critical for understanding early cognition, interpreting them is challenging because infants’ responses are highly variable. This variability has been treated as an unavoidable nuisance inherent to infant research. Here we asked whether the variability contains signal in addition to noise: namely, whether some infants show consistently stronger responses to expectancy violations than others. Infants watched two unrelated physical events 6 mo apart; these events culminated in either an impossible or an expected outcome. We found that infants who exhibited the strongest looking response to an impossible event at 11 mo also exhibited the strongest response to an entirely different impossible event at 17 mo. Furthermore, violation-of-expectation responses in infancy predicted children’s explanation-based curiosity at 3 y old. In contrast, there was no longitudinal relation between infants’ responses to events with expected outcomes at 11 and 17 mo, nor any link with later curiosity; hence, infants’ responses do not merely reflect individual differences in attention but are specific to expectancy violations. Some children are better than others at detecting prediction errors—a trait that may be linked to later cognitive abilities.","Perez, Jasmin; Feigenson, Lisa",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8271639/,8
19330,Measuring adherence to therapy in airways disease,2021-06-11,"We previously investigated the role of Nitazoxanide (NTZ), a thiazolide endowed with antiviral and antiparasitic activity, in HIV-1 infection. NTZ treatment in primary isolated PBMCs was able to reduce HIV-1 infection in vitro by inducing the expression of a number of type-I interferon-stimulated genes. Among them, NTZ was able to induce cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (CH25H), which is involved in cholesterol metabolism. In the present study, we wanted to deepen our knowledge about the antiviral mechanism of action of NTZ. Indeed, by inducing CH25H, which catalyzes the formation of 25-hydroxycholesterol from cholesterol, NTZ treatment repressed cholesterol biosynthetic pathways and promoted cholesterol mobilization and efflux from the cell. Such effects were even more pronounced upon stimulation with FLU antigens in combination. It is already well known how lipid metabolism and virus replication are tightly interconnected; thus, it is not surprising that the antiviral immune response employs genes related to cholesterol metabolism. Indeed, NTZ was able to modulate cholesterol metabolism in vitro and, by doing so, enhance the antiviral response. These results give us the chance to speculate about the suitability of NTZ as adjuvant for induction of specific natural immunity. Moreover, the putative application of NTZ to alimentary-related diseases should be investigated.","Fenizia, Claudio; Ibba, Salomè Valentina; Vanetti, Claudia; Strizzi, Sergio; Rossignol, Jean-François; Biasin, Mara; Trabattoni, Daria; Clerici, Mario",Infect Dis Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8293206/,8

This retrospective study aimed to compare the early and late outcomes of D1-AAD and D2-AAD through a propensity score-matched analysis. METHODS: Between January 2009 and April 2020, 599 consecutive patients underwent ATAAD repair at our institution, and were dichotomized into D1 (n = 543; 90.7%) and D2 (n = 56; 9.3%) groups. Propensity scoring was performed with a 1:1 ratio, resulting in a matched cohort of 56 patients per group. The clinical features, postoperative complications, 5-year cumulative survival and freedom from reoperation rates were compared. RESULTS: In the overall cohort, the D1 group had a lower rate of preoperative shock and more aortic arch replacement with longer cardiopulmonary bypass time. The D1 group had a higher in-hospital mortality rate than the D2 group in overall (15.8% vs 5.4%; P = 0.036) and matched cohorts (19.6% vs 5.4%; P = 0.022). For patients that survived to discharge, the D1 and D2 groups demonstrated similar 5-year survival rates in overall (77.0% vs 85.2%; P = 0.378) and matched cohorts (79.1% vs 85.2%; P = 0.425). The 5-year freedom from reoperation rates for D1 and D2 groups were 80.0% and 97.1% in overall cohort (P = 0.011), and 93.6% and 97.1% in matched cohort (P = 0.474), respectively.

19852,Role of Melatonin in Angiotensin and Aging,2021-07-31,"Efficient use of herbicides for plant protection requires the application of auxiliary substances such as surfactants, stabilizers, wetting or anti-foaming agents, and absorption enhancers, which can be more problematic for environment than the herbicides themselves. We hypothesized that the combination of sulfonylurea (iodosulfuron-methyl) anion with inexpensive, commercially available quaternary tetraalkylammonium cations could lead to biologically active ionic liquids (ILs) that could become a convenient and environment-friendly alternative to adjuvants. A simple one-step synthesis allowed for synthesizing iodosulfuron-methyl based ILs with high yields ranging from 88 to 96% as confirmed by UV, FTIR, and NMR. The obtained ILs were found to possess several favorable properties compared to the currently used sodium salt iodosulfuron-methyl, such as adjustable hydrophobicity (octanol-water partition coefficient) and enhanced stability in aqueous solutions, which was supported by molecular calculations showing cation–anion interaction energies. In addition, soil mobility and volatility of ILs were more beneficial compared to the parental herbicide. Herbicidal activity tests toward oil-seed rape and cornflower revealed that ILs comprising at least one alkyl chain in the decyl to octadecyl range had similar or better efficacy compared to the commercial preparation without addition of any adjuvant. Furthermore, results of antimicrobial activity indicated that they were practically harmless or slightly toxic toward model soil microorganisms such as Pseudomonas putida and Bacillus cereus.","Stachowiak, Witold; Szumski, Radosław; Homa, Jan; Woźniak-Karczewska, Marta; Parus, Anna; Strzemiecka, Beata; Chrzanowski, Łukasz; Niemczak, Michał",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8348827/,8
20106,Asbestos Diseases Research Institute – A New WHO Collaborating Center,2021-07-11,"Peptides are used to control the pharmacokinetic profiles of nanoparticles due to their ability to influence tissue accumulation and cellular interactions. However, beyond the study of specific peptides, there is a lack of understanding of how peptide physicochemical properties affect nanoparticle pharmacokinetics, particularly in the context of traumatic brain injury (TBI). We engineered nanoparticle surfaces with peptides that possess a range of physicochemical properties and evaluated their distribution after two routes of administration: direct injection into a healthy mouse brain and systemic delivery in a mouse model of TBI. In both administration routes, we found that peptide-modified nanoparticle pharmacokinetics were influenced by the charge characteristics of the peptide. When peptide-modified nanoparticles are delivered directly into the brain, nanoparticles modified with positively charged peptides displayed restricted distribution from the injection site compared to nanoparticles modified with neutral, zwitterionic, or negatively charged peptides. After intravenous administration in a TBI mouse model, positively charged peptide-modified nanoparticles accumulated more in off-target organs, including the heart, lung, and kidneys, than zwitterionic, neutral, or negatively charged peptide-modified nanoparticles. The increase in off-target organ accumulation of positively charged peptide-modified nanoparticles was concomitant with a relative decrease in accumulation in the injured brain compared to zwitterionic, neutral, or negatively charged peptide-modified nanoparticles. Understanding how nanoparticle pharmacokinetics are influenced by the physicochemical properties of peptides presented on the nanoparticle surface is relevant to the development of nanoparticle-based TBI therapeutics and broadly applicable to nanotherapeutic design, including synthetic nanoparticles and viruses.

20507,The Role of Autophagy in Anti-Cancer and Health Promoting Effects of Cordycepin,2021-08-16,"In order to provide an alternative treatment option to lung transplantation for patients with end-stage lung disease, we aim for the development of an implantable biohybrid lung (BHL), based on hollow fiber membrane (HFM) technology used in extracorporeal membrane oxygenators. Complete hemocompatibility of all blood contacting surfaces is crucial for long-lasting BHL durability and can be achieved by their endothelialization. Autologous endothelial cells (ECs) would be the ideal cell source, but their limited proliferation potential excludes them for this purpose. As induced pluripotent stem cell-derived ECs enable the generation of a large number of ECs, we assessed and compared their capacity to form a viable and confluent monolayer on HFM, while indicating physiologic EC-specific anti-thrombogenic and anti-inflammatory properties. ECs were generated from three different human iPSC lines, and seeded onto fibronectin-coated poly-4-methyl-1-pentene (PMP) HFM. Following phenotypical characterization, ECs were analyzed for their thrombogenic and inflammatory behavior with or without TNFα induction, using FACS and qRT-PCR. Complementary, leukocyte- and platelet adhesion assays were carried out. The capacity of the iPSC-ECs to reendothelialize cell-free monolayer areas was assessed in a scratch assay. ECs sourced from umbilical cord blood (hCBECs) were used as control. iPSC-derived ECs formed confluent monolayers on the HFM and showed the typical EC-phenotype by expression of VE-cadherin and collagen-IV. A low protein and gene expression level of E-selectin and tissue factor was detected for all iPSC-ECs and the hCBECs, while a strong upregulation of these markers was noted upon stimulation with TNFα. This was in line with the physiological and strong induction of leukocyte adhesion detected after treatment with TNFα, iPSC-EC and hCBEC monolayers were capable of reducing thrombocyte adhesion and repopulating scratched areas. iPSCs offer the possibility to provide patient-specific ECs in abundant numbers needed to cover all blood contacting surfaces of the BHL with a viable, non-thrombogenic and non-inflammatory monolayer. iPSC-EC clones can differ in terms of their reendothelialization rate, and pro-inflammatory response. However, a less profound inflammatory response may even be advantageous for BHL application. With the proven ability of the seeded iPSC-ECs to reduce thrombocyte adhesion, we expect that thrombotic events that could lead to BHL occlusion can be avoided, and thus, justifies further studies on enabling BHL long-term application.","Pflaum, Michael; Dahlmann, Julia; Engels, Lena; Naghilouy-Hidaji, Hossein; Adam, Denise; Zöllner, Janina; Otto, Annette; Schmeckebier, Sabrina; Martin, Ulrich; Haverich, Axel; Olmer, Ruth; Wiegmann, Bettina",Micromachines (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8401467/,8

Our work describes the encapsulation process of a common anticancer drug, Isatin (1H-indole-2,3-dione) as a guest molecule, in a capped single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) host with chirality of (10,10). The encapsulation process was modelled, considering an aqueous solution, by a molecular dynamics (MD) simulation under a canonical NVT ensemble. The interactions between the atoms of Isatin were obtained from the DREIDING force filed. The storage capacity of the capped SWCNT host was evaluated to quantify its capacity to host multiple Isatin molecules. Our results show that the Isatin can be readily trapped inside the volume cavity of the capped SWCNT and it remained stable, as featured by a reduction in the van der Waals forces between Isatin guest and the SWCNT host (at approximately − 30 kcal mol(−1)) at the end of the MD simulation (15 ns). Moreover, the free energy of encapsulation was found to be − 34 kcal mol(−1) suggesting that the Isatin insertion procedure into the SWCNT occurred spontaneously. As calculated, a capped SWCNT (10,10) with a length of 30 Å, was able to host eleven (11) molecules of Isatin, that all remained steadily encapsulated inside the SWCNT volume cavity, showing a potential for the use of carbon nanotubes as drug delivery cargo systems.","Dehaghani, Maryam Zarghami; Yousefi, Farrokh; Seidi, Farzad; Bagheri, Babak; Mashhadzadeh, Amin Hamed; Naderi, Ghasem; Esmaeili, Amin; Abida, Otman; Habibzadeh, Sajjad; Saeb, Mohammad Reza; Rybachuk, Maksym",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8455564/,8
21544,A bioinspired synthetic soft hydrogel for the treatment of dry eye,2021-06-05,"BACKGROUND: Noroviruses are a major cause of epidemic and sporadic acute non-bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. Unfortunately, the development of an effective norovirus vaccine has proven difficult and no prophylactic vaccine is currently available. Further research on norovirus vaccine development should be considered an absolute priority and novel vaccine candidates are needed. One of the recent approaches in safe vaccine development is the use of virus-like particles (VLPs). VLP-based vaccines show great immunogenic potential as they mimic the morphology and structure of viral particles without the presence of the virus genome. RESULTS: This study is the first report showing successful production of norovirus VLPs in the protozoan Leishmania tarentolae (L. tarentolae) expression system. Protozoan derived vaccine candidate is highly immunogenic and able to not only induce a strong immune response (antibody titer reached 10(4)) but also stimulate the production of neutralizing antibodies confirmed by receptor blocking assay. Antibody titers able to reduce VLP binding to the receptor by > 50% (BT(50)) were observed for 1:5–1:320 serum dilutions. CONCLUSIONS: Norovirus VLPs produced in L. tarentolae could be relevant for the development of the norovirus vaccine.","Panasiuk, Mirosława; Zimmer, Karolina; Czarnota, Anna; Grzyb, Katarzyna; Narajczyk, Magdalena; Peszyńska-Sularz, Grażyna; Żołędowska, Sabina; Nidzworski, Dawid; Hovhannisyan, Lilit; Gromadzka, Beata",Microb Cell Fact,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8464126/,8
21675,A(2A) Adenosine Receptor as a Potential Biomarker and a Possible Therapeutic Target in Alzheimer’s Disease,2021-09-07,"Infecting approximately one-third of the world’s population, the neurotropic protozoan Toxoplasma gondii has been associated with cognition and several neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Findings have been mixed, however, about the relationship between Toxoplasma gondii and depression, with some studies reporting positive associations and others finding no associations. To further investigate the association between Toxoplasma gondii and depression, we used data from the UK Biobank and the National Health and Examination Survey (NHANES). Results from adjusted multiple-regression modeling showed no significant associations between Toxoplasma gondii and depression in either the UK Biobank or NHANES datasets. Further, we found no significant interactions between Toxoplasma gondii and age, sex, educational attainment, and income in either dataset that affected the association between Toxoplasma gondii and depression. These results from two community-based datasets suggest that in these samples, Toxoplasma gondii is not associated with depression. Differences between our findings and other findings showing an association between Toxoplasma gondii and depression could be due to several factors including differences in socioeconomic variables, differences in Toxoplasma gondii strain, and use of different covariates in statistical modeling.","Gale, Shawn D.; Erickson, Lance D.; Brown, Bruce L.; Hedges, Dawson W.",Pathogens,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8470860/,8

22547,Oral Presentations,2018-08-20,"BACKGROUND: HH is a key component to decrease infections in hospitals, but compliance in HCW remains low. We present a six-month strategy to empower patients’ caregivers on HCW HH compliance. METHODS: HH compliance in HCWs was evaluated between June 1 and August 31, 2017 as recommended by WHO. Between September 1, 2016 and March 31, 2017 we undertook the empowering in the hematology-oncology ward (50 beds) from Instituto Nacional de Cancerologia, a cancer referral, teaching hospital in Mexico. To empower patients and their caregivers, a member of the team visited the patient and their relatives during the first 24h of hospital admission. Standarized information on HH and the importance of HCW compliance was given, along with a printed cartoon on HH opportunities (5 moments from WHO). Patients and their caregivers were trained to observe and record HH opportunties, an were invited to remind HCWs if HH omissions were observed. Data on HH compliance was collected monthly during the empowerment and 1 month after. Data was compared with the HH compliance from the 6 previous. We compared overall compliance and for each 5 HH moments before and after the empowering (chi (2) test). RESULTS: We empowered 82 caregivers (M: 25.6%) and F: 74.4%), mean age 44 years. 24.4% had completed primary education, and 13.1% had higher education. Mothers and spouses were the primary caregivers (28.1% and 36.6%). HH compliance increased in all 5 moments: Before touching a patient (M1) (B: 9.5%, A: 57.6%, P = 0.005); before a clean or aseptic procedure (M2) (B: 7.9%, A: 48%, P = 0.002); after body fluid exposure (M3) (B: 10%, A: 59%, P = 0.0005), after touching a patient (M4) (B: 7.4%, A: 57.9%, P = 0.0005), and after touching patient surroundings (M5) (B: 2.4%, A: 77.4%, P = 0.0008). Nurses achieved a higher increase on compliance compared with physicians. Caregivers recognition on HH increased for each opporunity, being more notorious for M2 (B:31.7%, A: 61.5%); M3 (B: 7.3%, A: 31.5%), and M4, (B: 36.5%, A: 68.7%). Perception on the importance of preventing health-care-related infections increased from 80.5% to 90.3%. CONCLUSION: Empowering patients’ primary caregivers was an effective intervention to increase HCWs HH compliance at a hematology-oncology ward. The effect of this intervention remains to be evaluated on the long-term basis, but demonstrate the importance of involving patients and their relatives on health-care delivery.

23975,Non-vaccine-Preventable Infections,2019-10-19,"The majority of all emerging pathogens in humans are zoonotic (nonhuman animal) in origin. Population, ecological, and behavioral changes that increase contact with wildlife exacerbate emergence of these pathogens. Anthropogenic modification of the physical environment has altered not only our risk of zoonotic infection from wildlife but also the likelihood of pathogen transmission from human to nonhuman animal populations. This is particularly the case for primates that share a number of common infections with humans. In this chapter, I use a series of case studies involving SARS, HIV, Nipah virus, Lyme disease, malaria, and Ebola to exemplify how various anthropogenic factors have facilitated pathogen transmission between human and nonhuman animal populations. The costs and benefits of primate-based ecotourism are also reviewed to better illustrate how human-wildlife contact can affect both populations. Responsible health monitoring of human-wildlife interactions is a necessary prerequisite for prevention of the transmission of future emerging infectious diseases.","Muehlenbein, Michael P.",Human-Environment Interactions,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120142/,8

Gladiatoren werden aangemoedigd om in de arena het bloed van de verslagenen te drinken om een deel van hun moed en kracht te verkrijgen. Anderzijds heerste in die tijd ook de gedachte dat een slechte gezondheid, geestelijke ziekten en depressies een gevolg waren van verdorven lichaamssappen of vergiftigd bloed en dat aderlaten om die reden een geneeskracht had voor vele kwalen. Ovidius vertelde in zijn Metamorphosen (43 v.Chr.) het verhaal van de tovenares Medea, die het verdriet van haar geliefde Jason over zijn steeds zwakker wordende oude vader nauwelijks kon verdragen. In een poging de vader weer kracht te geven en te verjongen, sneed ze de keel van de oude man door, liet al het bloed eruit lopen en verving het door een eigen toversap. En ziedaar, het wonder geschiedde: zijn witte haren en baard werden zwart, zijn rimpels verdwenen en hij verrees krachtig van lijf en leden. Ook toen bloedtransfusies tot de mogelijkheden gingen behoren, werden ze gek genoeg niet gebruikt om een voor de hand liggende reden als bloedverlies, maar voor de bestrijding van allerlei geestelijke of emotionele kwalen.","de Wolf, J.Th.M.; Roeloffzen, W.W.H.",Hematologie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7120193/,8

Such benefits can stem from improved access to capital by firms, better allocation of capital to investment projects, greater risk management, and enhanced portfolio diversification and liquidity for individual investors. While existing economic research shows the development of financial services is generally important for economic growth, a number of previous studies by Outreville (1990) and Ward and Zurbruegg (2000) provide empirical evidence that insurance market development in its own right can promote economic development. The importance of the insurance industry to the wider economy is seen to stem from the relative size of the insurance industry to GDP in many developed economies, the transfer of risks, and the scale of insurance companies’ financial intermediary functions.","Hussels, Stephanie; Sherman, Claire; Ward, Damian; Zurbruegg, Ralf",Handbook of International Insurance,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122388/,8

We design algorithms for reconstructing k-reticulated network (k = 1 or 2) with minimum number of hybrid nodes from a set of m binary trees, each with n leaves in O(mn (2)) time. The implication is that some level-x networks with x > k can now be reconstructed in a faster way. We implemented our algorithm (ARTNET) and compared it with CMPT. We show that ARTNET outperforms CMPT in terms of running time and accuracy. We also consider the case when there does not exist a 2-reticulated network for the input trees. We present an algorithm computing a maximum subset of the species set so that a new set of subtrees can be combined into a 2-reticulated network.","Vu, Hoa; Chin, Francis; Hon, W.

It is based on a paradigm of rapid detection and response to outbreak events, and on a norm of collective action. Drawing on examples from the 2014–2015 Ebola epidemic, we argue that pandemic preparedness is not just a technical matter, but also a political and normative one.

26151,Pathogenesis of Sepsis,2017-12-28,"Signal transduction associated with growth factor receptors typically mediates the activation of cell cycle promoting gene products or the inactivation of cell cycle checkpoints. These signals are frequently transduced through G-Protein pathways, kinase receptor pathways, or nuclear receptor pathways (Fig. 4.1), are dependent on proto-oncogenic transcription factors, and lead to the expression of Cyclins and Cyclin-Dependent Kinases (CDKs), which are drivers of the cell cycle (Fig. 4.2). Physiologically, growth signals are transient and entirely depend on the engagement of a growth factor receptor by its cognate ligand. Upon termination of this interaction, the growth signal ceases. Gain-of-function mutations in cancer keep the growth signal active, regardless of the presence of the transient growth factor-receptor interaction. Such deregulated signaling cascades are appropriate drug targets in the treatment of cancer.","Weber, Georg F.",Molecular Therapies of Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7122987/,8

The propaganda role of the publishing industry may have declined after the onset of economic reforms, but the ability of the party-state to maintain its political control has not been weakened, and may have even been strengthened. In spite of the corporatization, China’s publishing houses were never intended to be pure business entities, and many continue to rely on monopolistic profits or government subsidies for their financial viability. The digital transformation in publishers is heavily shaped and constrained by the institutional problems of the publishing industry.","Yun, Qidong",China's Publishing Industry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7155546/,8

Five adaptive modes are described: 1) fire‐resistant species that are large, thick‐barked, and have large cones and long needles; 2) tall, fast‐growing mesophytic species with moderately high shade tolerance; 3) stress‐tolerant species with animal‐dispersed seeds, occurring mainly on cold or dry sites where fire is infrequent; 4) fire‐resilient species that are precocious reproducers with small seeds, often in serotinous cones; and 5) species of southern mesic sites with fast growth, strong, heavy wood and short persistence of needles. Intermediates between these modes exist. Convergent evolution has occasionally occurred, as shown by high ecological similarity of species in different taxonomic sections within Pinus. However, the analogies between species are imperfect, suggesting the importance of constraint by shared ancestry and divergence produced by a diversity of environments.","McCune, Bruce",Am J Bot,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7159465/,8

In this study, we offer a different approach based on the emotionally analyzed concatenation of movie script and their respective reviews. The rationale behind this model is that if the emotional experience described by the reviewer corresponds with or diverges from the emotions expressed in the movie script, then this correlation will be reflected in the particular rating of the movie. We collected a dataset consisting of 747 movie scripts and 78.000 reviews and recreated many conventional approaches for movie rating prediction, including Vector Semantics and Sentiment Analysis techniques ran with a variety of Machine Learning algorithms, in order to more accurately evaluate the performance of our model and the validity of our hypothesis.

33642,Susceptibility Patterns of Multidrug-Resistant Acinetobacter baumannii,2020-06-04,"BACKGROUND: Obesity has reached an alarming rate worldwide. Promoting thermogenesis via increasing the function of brown adipose tissue (BAT) or white adipose tissue (WAT) browning has been proposed as a new protective approach against obesity. The goal of this study was to evaluate the effects of Royal Jelly (RJ) and tocotrienol rich fraction (TRF) on BAT activation and WAT browning during calorie restriction diet (CRD) in obesity model. METHODS: In this experimental study, 50 obese Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups and then received one of the following treatments for a period of 8-week: High-fat diet (HFD), CRD, RJ + CRD, TRF + CRD, and RJ + TRF + CRD. Effects of RJ and TRF, individually and in combination on body weight and the expression of key thermoregulatory genes in WAT and BAT were examined by quantitative real-time (qRT-PCR). Also, morphological alterations were assessed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. RESULTS: RJ (− 67.21 g ±4.84 g) and RJ + TRF (− 73.29 g ±4.51 g) significantly reduced weight gain relative to the CRD group (− 40.70 g ±6.50 g, P < 0.001). In comparison with the CRD group, RJ and RJ + TRF remarkably enhanced the uncoupling protein1 (UCP1) expression in WAT (5.81, 4.72 fold, P < 0.001) and BAT (4.99, 4.75 fold, P < 0.001). The expression of PR domain containing 16(PRDM 16), cAMP response element-binding protein1 (CREB1), P38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (P38MAPK), and Bone morphogenetic protein8B (BMP8B) have significantly increased following RJ and RJ + TRF treatments (P < 0.001). However, the expression levels of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (CEBPβ) and Bone morphogenetic protein7 (BMP7) did not remarkably change. Multilocular beige cells in WAT and compacted dense adipocytes were also observed in BAT of RJ and RJ + TRF received groups. TRF showed no substantial effects on the expression of the mentioned thermoregulatory genes and brown fat-like phenotype. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that, Royal Jelly promotes thermogenesis and browning of WAT, contributing to an increase in energy expenditure. Thus, Royal Jelly may give rise to a novel dietary choice to attenuate obesity.","Mesri Alamdari, Naimeh; Irandoost, Pardis; Roshanravan, Neda; Vafa, Mohammadreza; Asghari Jafarabadi, Mohammad; Alipour, Shahriar; Roshangar, Leila; Alivand, Mohammadreza; Farsi, Farnaz; Shidfar, Farzad",Nutr Metab (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7266117/,8

33992,Wound Healing,2020-06-07,"Influence maximization is a fundamental problem in several real life applications such as viral marketing, recommendation system, collaboration and social networks. Maximizing influence spreading in a given network aims to find the initially active vertex set of size k called seed nodes (or initial spreaders (In this paper, we use seed set and initial spreaders interchangeably.)) which maximizes the expected number of the infected vertices. The state-of-the-art local-based techniques developed to solve this problem are based on local structure information such as degree centrality, nodes clustering coefficient, and others utilize the whole network structure, such as k-core decomposition, and node betweenness. In this paper, we aim at solving the problem of influence maximization using maximal clique problem. Our intuition is based on the fact that the presence of a dense neighborhood around a node is fundamental to the maximization of influence. Our approach follows the following three steps: (1) discovering all the maximal cliques from the complex network; (2) filtering the set of maximal cliques; we then denote the vertices belonging to the rest of maximal cliques as superordinate vertices, and (3) ranking the superordinate nodes according to some indicators. We evaluate the proposed framework empirically against several high-performing methods on a number of real-life datasets. The experimental results show that our algorithms outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in finding the best initial spreaders in networks.","Mhadhbi, Nizar; Raddaoui, Badran",Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7274323/,8

Early detection and faster automated screening of the COVID-19 patients is essential. For this, the images are considered from publicly available datasets. Significant biomarkers representing critical image features are extracted from CNN by experimentally investigating on cross-validation methods and hyperparameter settings. The performance of the network is evaluated using standard metrics. Perturbation based occlusion sensitivity maps are employed on the features obtained from the classification model to visualise the localization of abnormal areas. Results demonstrate that the simplified CNN model with optimised parameters is able to extract significant features with a sensitivity of 97.35% and F-measure of 96.71% to detect COVID-19 images. The algorithm achieves an Area Under the Curve-Receiver Operating Characteristic score of 99.4% with Matthews correlation coefficient of 0.93. High value of Diagnostic odds ratio is also obtained. Occlusion sensitivity maps provide precise localization of abnormal regions by identifying COVID-19 conditions. As early detection through chest radiographic images are useful for automated screening of the disease, this method appears to be clinically relevant in providing a visual diagnostic solution using a simplified and efficient model.","Govindarajan, Satyavratan; Swaminathan, Ramakrishnan",Appl Intell,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7647189/,8

The causative virus (PRRSV) is divided into two species, PRRSV-1 (European origin) and PRRSV-2 (North American origin). Within PRRSV-1, PRRSV-1.3 strains, such as Lena, are more pathogenic than PRRSV-1.1 strains, such as Flanders 13 (FL13). To date, the molecular interactions of PRRSV with primary lung mononuclear phagocyte (MNP) subtypes, including conventional dendritic cells types 1 (cDC1) and 2 (cDC2), monocyte-derived DCs (moDC), and pulmonary intravascular macrophages (PIM), have not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we analyze the transcriptome profiles of in vivo FL13-infected parenchymal MNP subpopulations and of in vitro FL13- and Lena-infected parenchymal MNP. The cell-specific expression profiles of in vivo sorted cells correlated with their murine counterparts (AM, cDC1, cDC2, moDC) with the exception of PIM. Both in vivo and in vitro, FL13 infection altered the expression of a low number of host genes, and in vitro infection with Lena confirmed the higher ability of this strain to modulate host response. Machine learning (ML) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) unraveled additional relevant genes and pathways modulated by FL13 infection that were not identified by conventional analyses. GSEA increased the cellular pathways enriched in the FL13 data set, but ML allowed a more complete comprehension of functional profiles during FL13 in vitro infection. Data indicates that cellular reprogramming differs upon Lena and FL13 infection and that the latter might keep antiviral and inflammatory macrophage/DC functions silent. Although the slow replication kinetics of FL13 likely contribute to differences in cellular gene expression, the data suggest distinct mechanisms of interaction of the two viruses with the innate immune system during early infection.","Crisci, Elisa; Moroldo, Marco; Vu Manh, Thien-Phong; Mohammad, Ammara; Jourdren, Laurent; Urien, Celine; Bouguyon, Edwige; Bordet, Elise; Bevilacqua, Claudia; Bourge, Mickael; Pezant, Jérémy; Pléau, Alexis; Boulesteix, Olivier; Schwartz, Isabelle; Bertho, Nicolas; Giuffra, Elisabetta",Front Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7750501/,8
44294,Hippocampal and Prefrontal Cortical Brain Tissue Levels of Irisin and GDF15 Receptor Subunits in Children,2021-01-07,"BACKGROUND: Patient with COVID-19 may exhibit a wide array of neurologic manifestations, including stroke; in some cases, stroke is the presenting or predominant manifestation. The frequency of stroke in COVID-19 has varied greatly in previous reports, probably reflecting the intensity with which neurologic abnormalities have been sought. The great majority of stroke have been thought to be ischemic. METHODS: Review of data, case reports, and case series RESULTS: See table 1 for a summary of reported data on neurologic manifestations of COVID-19. When MRI has been done, the great majority of strokes have been shown to be ischemic. COVID-19 causes a generalized hypercoagulable state, and arterial thromboses have been recognized in other organs, as well, involving pulmonary, mesenteric and coronary arteries. Coronavirus infection causes an intense release of cytokines with widespread activation of the coagulation cascade. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 attaches to ACE 2 receptors on endothelial surfaces via the S (spike) protein and invades causing a localized inflammatory response, with a resulting increase in local thrombotic activity. Antiphospholipid antibodies are sometimes present. New data suggest possible role of alpha-defensin level in creation and prevention of disintegration of blood clots. To date, reports of neurologic disease are based on case series, so there is no way, at present, to calculate the frequency of neurologic complications of COVID-19. A systematic, prospective study focusing on neurologic examination supplemented by MRI in hospitalized patients would answer the question of the incidence of this complication, but logistical problems including patients’ need for ICU care and concern for contagion resulting from sending patents out of the ICU for procedures mitigate against the likelihood of such a study being done. CONCLUSION: We hypothesize that: (1) stroke occurs in COVID-19 more frequently than is recognized; (2) a hypercoagulable state with inflammation at the site of local invasion of vascular endothelial cells by SARS-CoV-2, perhaps with a role for antiphospolipid antibodies all contribute to the pathogenesis of stroke; and (3) more liberal use of anticoagulation in COVID-19 cases should be considered.

Let t be an algebraic degree of a target function, e.g. [Formula: see text] (resp. [Formula: see text] ) for linear (resp. non-linear) function. The d-th order TI encodes the internal state into [Formula: see text] shares. Hence, the area size increases proportionally to the number of shares. This implies that TBC based modes can be smaller than block cipher (BC) based modes in TI because TBC requires s-bit block to ensure s-bit security, e.g. PFB and Romulus, while BC requires 2s-bit block. However, even with those TBC based modes, the minimum we can reach is 3 shares of s-bit state with [Formula: see text] and the first-order TI ([Formula: see text] ). Our first design [Formula: see text] aims to break the barrier of the 3s-bit state in TI. The block size of an underlying TBC is s/2 bits and the output of TBC is linearly expanded to s bits. This expanded state requires only 2 shares in the first-order TI, which makes the total state size 2.5s bits. We also provide rigorous security proof of [Formula: see text] . Our second design [Formula: see text] further increases a parameter [Formula: see text] : a ratio of the security level s to the block size of an underlying TBC. We prove security of [Formula: see text] for any [Formula: see text] under some assumptions for an underlying TBC and for parameters used to update a state. Next, we show a concrete instantiation of [Formula: see text] for 128-bit security. It requires a TBC with 64-bit block, 128-bit key and 128-bit tweak, while no existing TBC can support it. We design a new TBC by extending SKINNY and provide basic security evaluation. Finally, we give hardware benchmarks of [Formula: see text] in the first-order TI to show that TI of [Formula: see text] is smaller than that of PFB by more than one thousand gates and is the smallest within the schemes having 128-bit security.","Naito, Yusuke; Sasaki, Yu; Sugawara, Takeshi",Advances in Cryptology - EUROCRYPT 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7991735/,8

One of the key strategies has been the principle of “‘test, track, and trace” to minimize spread of the virus. Numerous COVID-19 contact tracing applications have been rolled around the world to monitor and control the spread of the disease. We explore the characteristics of various COVID-19 applications and especially the Aarogya Setu COVID-19 app from India in its role in fighting the current pandemic. We assessed the current literature available to us using conventional search engines, including but not limited to PubMed, Google Scholar, and Research Gate in May 2020 till the time of submission of this article. The search criteria used MeSH keywords such as “COVID-19,” “pandemics,” “contact tracing,” and “mobile applications.” A variable uptake of different COVID-19 applications has been noted with increasing enrolment around the world. Security concerns about data privacy remain. The various COVID-19 applications will complement manual contact tracing system to assess and prevent viral transmission. Test, track, trace, and support policy will play a key role in avoidance of a “second wave” of the novel coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 outbreak.","Iyengar, Karthikeyan P.; Jain, Rachit; Samy, David Ananth; Jain, Vijay Kumar; Vaishya, Raju; Suraliwala, Khushroo",Indian J Med Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8219017/,8

Blood. 2012;119(6):1399-1406.",2014-01-16,"There are two main paths to herd immunity for COVID‐19 — vaccines or natural infection. Vaccination for SARS‐CoV‐2 (the virus that causes COVID‐19) is the ideal approach to achieving herd immunity. However, reaching herd immunity through vaccination has several challenges such as certain groups’ objection to vaccines due to religious objections, fears regarding possible risks or skepticism about the benefits. This objection and skepticism is of great concern to the current COVID‐19 vaccination campaign. If the proportion of vaccinated people in a community falls below the herd immunity threshold, exposure to contagious SARS‐CoV‐2 could result in a new surge of of COVID‐19. This concern is further magnified by the recent CDC findings that people with no symptoms transmit more than half (59%) of all COVID‐19 cases. This number includes 35% of new cases from people who infect others prior to showing symptoms and 24% of new cases from people who never develop symptoms. The spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories regarding COVID‐19 vaccination poses a great threat to the vaccination campaign of young adults. In an effort to further understand this current social media misinformation narrative, we surveyed college students between the ages of 18‐23 and their willingness to take the vaccine. Our survey included “fact checking” pieces of social media misinformation and investigated whether adults in this age group have been influenced by widely circulated misinformation. Our survey also included questions to investigate the potential that a significant portion of people in this age group might completely oppose vaccinations. Our findings further support the need for efficacious therapeutics for natural viral infection as an alternative to vaccination. Providing the population with an assortment of therapeutic options will reduce death caused by natural viral infection as the U.S. and world population attempts to reach herd immunity.","Federico, Francesca; Esmaeli‐Azad, Babak",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239779/,8

Pharmacy students in a first-year lab course were introduced to library and drug information resources through a lecture-style class in their first week of school, which was ineffective in terms of engagement. To combat this issue, the pharmacy liaison librarian advocated for moving this class session later in the semester and proposed a game-based activity to replace the lecture. CASE PRESENTATION: “The Amazing Race: Drug Information Edition” was inspired by a well-known TV competition that involves completing several stages (called “legs”) of challenges to finish the race. The librarian developed questions designed to make students use various parts of the library website as well as two drug information databases. Students competed in teams, and the first three teams to complete the race were awarded small prizes. The race was first implemented in 2018, and modifications were made to the 2019 iteration based on student feedback. CONCLUSIONS: Despite several challenges, the race was well received by both the students and the course instructors and increased engagement with introductory library and drug information material. The activity has enhanced the librarian's relationship and collaboration with the course faculty and made a positive impression on the students.","Gorman, Emily F.",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8485938/,8
58825,Editorial: Precision Medicine in Chronic Inflammation,2021-09-23,"From March 2020, the Mathematics Support Centre at University College Dublin, Ireland, and the Mathematics Education Support Hub at Western Sydney University, Australia, moved wholly online and have largely remained so to the point of writing (August 2021). The dramatic and swift changes brought on by COVID-19, in particular to fully online modes of teaching and learning including mathematics and statistics support (MSS), have presented students and tutors with a host of new opportunities for thinking and working. This study aims to gain insight both from students and tutors about their experience of wholly online learning and tutoring in the COVID-19 era. In this sense, it represents a ‘perspectives’ study, the idea being that before we examine specific aspects of this experience, it would be best to know what the issues are. Employing a qualitative analysis framework of 23 one-on-one interview transcripts with tutors and students from both institutions in Australia and Ireland, we identified five key themes as central to the shared experiences and perspectives of tutors and students. In this study, we discuss three of these themes in relation to the new normal with the intention of supporting MSS practitioners, researchers and students going forward. The themes describe the usage of online support, how mathematics is different and the future of online MSS.","Mullen, Claire; Pettigrew, Jim; Cronin, Anthony; Rylands, Leanne; Shearman, Donald",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8500119/,8
59410,Repeat Surgery in Chronic Aortic Dissection: A New Technique without Touching the Native Aorta.,2020-02-19,"BACKGROUND: Laboratory viral nucleic acid testing (NAT), such as the nasopharyngeal swab test, is now recommended as the gold standard for the diagnosis of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19). However, the nasopharyngeal swab testing process may cause some discomfort. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the influence of nasopharyngeal swab tests on the anxiety and pain felt by psychiatric medical staff. METHODS: A total of 174 psychiatric medical staff (namely 97 doctors, 68 nurses, and nine administrators) and 27 controls were included in the current study. A self-designed questionnaire was used to collect their general demographic information (age, gender, marriage, occupation, profession, smoking history, alcohol consumption history, tea drinking history, previous history of anxiety and depression) as well as their subjective experience, such as nausea, vomiting, coughing, worry, fear, etc, during nasopharyngeal swab collection. The Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were used to assess the subjects’ pain and state anxiety, respectively. RESULTS: There were no statistical differences (p>0.05) in age, marriage, smoking history, a history of anxiety and depression, pain scores, and anxiety scores between different professions and genders. The results of partial correlation analysis (controlled for gender and history of depression or anxiety) indicated that the male gender was negatively correlated with being anxious (r=-0.148, p=0.037) and nervous (r=-0.171 p=0.016), although there was no significant difference in pain and anxiety between men and women. In addition, marriage might help women resist negative emotions. CONCLUSIONS: 1) There will be mild discomfort during nucleic acid testing, but not enough to cause pain and anxiety; 2) women are more likely to be anxious and nervous during the nucleic acid testing.","Li, Wei; Zhou, Han; Guo, Qian; Li, Guanjun",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8515122/,8

An effective treatment strategy for its prevention has not yet been defined. This review aimed to provide a viewpoint on the role of mesalazine, also note as 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), in the prevention of diverticulitis. A systematic electronic search of relevant articles was performed using PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Cochrane. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), open trials, and retrospective studies, published between January 1999 and January 2020, were identified. Twelve eligible studies that analyzed primary or secondary outcomes of diverticulitis were included. The population included patients with symptomatic uncomplicated diverticular disease (SUDD), or patients with a history of diverticulitis. All studies compared 5-ASA to placebo, rifaximin, or other treatments. Two studies, including 359 patients, assessed the efficacy of 5-ASA in preventing the first appearance of diverticulitis in patients with SUDD. Of these, one showed that 5-ASA was effective, and one did not. Ten studies, including 2.995 patients, assessed the efficacy of 5-ASA treatment in preventing the recurrence of diverticulitis in patients with a history of diverticulitis. Four studies showed that 5-ASA had a certain degree of efficacy. All four RCTs demonstrated that 5-ASA did not significantly reduce the rate of diverticulitis recurrence. In a retrospective trial, 5-ASA was less effective than rifaximin in preventing diverticulitis recurrence. In an open trial, there was no difference between 5-ASA and probiotic treatment. Overall, there is currently conflicting evidence regarding the efficacy of 5-ASA treatment in the prevention of diverticulitis and further RCTs are needed.","Stefanelli, G; Viscido, A; Valvano, M; Vernia, F; Frieri, G; Ashktorab, H; Latella, G",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202008_22504; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32767345/,8
60199,Chemoproteomic profiling reveals cellular targets of nitro-fatty acids.,2021-09-07,"OBJECTIVE To estimate the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of adverse events (AE) in chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine users. METHODS We systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs), using MEDLINE (2010-2020) and EMBASE (2010-2020) databases, reporting AE in chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine users during treatment for lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, malaria and COVID-19. The protocol for this systematic review is registered at the PROSPERO database (CRD42020197938). The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-Bias tool and relevant data were extracted though a customized data collection form, independently, by two authors. The IRR of AE was estimated using a random-effect model meta-analysis and heterogeneity was evaluated by T2 and I2. Subgroup analysis was performed, and publication bias was assessed by funnel-plot. RESULTS Forty-six RCTs met our eligibility criteria and were included in our analysis (23132 patients). There was not a single death attributed to chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine use in the included RCTs. The IRR of general AE during antimalarial use was 1.15 [CI 95% 1.01-1.31]. COVID-19 patients treated with either antimalarial presented an 83% and 165% higher risk of developing general and gastrointestinal AE, respectively, in comparison with controls. The use of antimalarial increased the risk of developing dermatological AE by 92% in malarial studies and reduced by 65% in lupus studies. We did not find a significatively higher risk of cardiovascular nor ophthalmological AE in antimalarial users. CONCLUSIONS Our data reinforces that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have a good safety profile though caution is advised when using higher than usual doses in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","Edington, Fernando Luiz Barros; Gadellha, Sandra Rocha; Santiago, Mittermayer Barreto",European journal of internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejim.2021.03.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33832827/,8

RECENT FINDINGS For decades, prophylaxis of cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been the standard preventive strategy, but new clinical trials are expected to determine the advantages of preemptive therapy over prophylaxis. Novel anti-CMV agents, such as maribavir and letermovir, are being studied for the treatment of resistant/refractory CMV as alternatives to foscarnet and cidofovir. CMV immune monitoring may offer individualized management plans. Epstein-Barr virus infections in transplant recipients are difficult to prevent and treat, though recent data suggest possible merit to pretransplant rituximab among high-risk transplant recipients. We review the groundbreaking HIV-to-HIV organ transplant trials, which are expected to revolutionize the care of HIV-infected individuals. Finally, we review topical developments in human herpesvirus 8, Zika virus, RNA respiratory viruses, adenovirus, norovirus, and polyoma viruses in organ transplantation. SUMMARY Ongoing trials to optimize CMV prophylaxis and treatment, and outcomes of HIV-to-HIV organ transplantation in the United States, have significant implications to optimize management of these viruses in transplant recipients.

60943,Cortical excitability in a nonhuman primate model of TMS.,2020-10-21,"The unfolded protein response (UPR) is an ancient cellular pathway that detects and alleviates protein-folding stresses. The UPR components X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) and inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) promote type I interferon (IFN) responses. We found that Xbp1-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts and macrophages had impaired antiviral resistance. However, this was not because of a defect in type I IFN responses but rather an inability of Xbp1-deficient cells to undergo viral-induced apoptosis. The ability to undergo apoptosis limited infection in wild-type cells. Xbp1-deficient cells were generally resistant to the intrinsic pathway of apoptosis through an indirect mechanism involving activation of the nuclease IRE1α. We observed an IRE1α-dependent reduction in the abundance of the proapoptotic microRNA miR-125a and a corresponding increase in the amounts of the members of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family. The activation of IRE1α by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) protein NS4B in XBP1-proficient cells also conferred apoptosis resistance and promoted viral replication. Furthermore, we found evidence of IRE1α activation and decreased miR-125a abundance in liver biopsies from patients infected with HCV compared to those in the livers of healthy controls. Our results reveal a prosurvival role for IRE1α in virally infected cells and suggest a possible target for IFN-independent antiviral therapy.","Fink, Susan L; Jayewickreme, Teshika R; Molony, Ryan D; Iwawaki, Takao; Landis, Charles S; Lindenbach, Brett D; Iwasaki, Akiko",Science signaling,https://doi.org/10.1126/scisignal.aai7814; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28588082/,8

METHODS AND RESULTS Clinical, electrocardiogram (ECG), and echocardiographic data were collected from members in a three-generation family. Whole exomes were amplified and sequenced for proband. The identified variants were verified in the remaining members. The pathogenicity of candidate variants was predicted using multiple software programmes. A 28-year-old non-consanguineous Chinese woman at 23 weeks' gestation presenting with sustained foetal bradycardia of 100 b.p.m. Immunological disorders and infection were excluded. The infant was delivered at 37 weeks' gestation with 2700-g birthweight. QTc was prolonged in both ECG and Holter recording. Hearing tests confirmed bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Genetic testing demonstrated that the infant carried a novel frameshift c.431delC (p.I145Sfs*92) and a novel nonsense c.1175G>A (p.W392X) compound variants of KCNQ1 inherited from mother and father, respectively, in autosomal recessive inheritance. Only relative II-5 carrying heterozygous KCNQ1-I145Sfs*92 variant had prolonged QTc, while the other carriers did not have prolonged QT, suggesting an autosomal dominant inheritance of LQT1 phenotype with incomplete penetrance in the family. CONCLUSION We report the novel frameshift KCNQ1-I145Sfs*92 and nonsense KCNQ1-W392X compound variants in autosomal recessive inheritance that caused JLNS presenting as sustained foetal bradycardia for the first time. Meanwhile, KCNQ1-I145Sfs*92 heterozygous variant demonstrated LQT1 phenotype in autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance.","Zhang, Yanmin; Li, Xiaomin; Yang, Ying; Wang, Jie; Gao, Xinru; Fan, Mengyun","Europace : European pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac electrophysiology : journal of the working groups on cardiac pacing, arrhythmias, and cardiac cellular electrophysiology of the European Society of Cardiology",https://doi.org/10.1093/europace/euaa154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830254/,8

We hereby present the technique of the laparoscopic repair of small ventral hernias (defect 2 centimetres), using the Ventralex mesh, which is bi-faceted, polypropylene and PTFE, circular preformed, it has 8 centimeters in diameter, fixated with 4 transparietal sutures. The mesh is created for open surgery but it is placed in the intraperitoneal cavity. This technique was used for 28 patients,16 women and 12 men, with an average age of 53,3 years (29-72 years), consisting of: 22 umbilical hernias (UH), 2 epigastric hernias (EH), one left-side Spiegelian hernia, one incisional hernia after an open surgery for an umbilical hernia with a Ventralex mesh, and 2 trocar eventrations (TE) after a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Mean operating time was 52 minutes (42-70 minutes), post-operative hospital stay of 1,8 days (1-5 days). The main advantages are: circular preformed mesh, diameter of 8 centimeters, transfascial suture fixation, correct mesh placement and unfolding may be verified by laparoscopy, reduced costs.

However, unlike RT-qPCR, there are no consensus detection regions or optimal RT-LAMP methods, and most protocols do not include internal controls to ensure reliability. Naked RNAs, plasmids, or even RNA from infectious COVID-19 patients have been used as external positive controls for RT-LAMP assays, but such reagents lack the stability required for full-process control. To overcome the lack of proper internal and external positive controls and the instability of the detection RNA, we developed virus-like particles (VLPs) using bacteriophage Qβ and plant virus cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV) for the encapsidation of target RNA, namely a so-called SARS-CoV-2 LAMP detection module (SLDM). The target RNA is a truncated segment of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) gene and human RNase P gene (internal control) as positive controls for RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP. Target RNAs stably encapsidated in Qβ and CCMV VLPs were previously shown to function as full-process controls in RT-qPCR assays, and here we show that SLDMs can fulfill the same function for RT-LAMP and swab-to-test (direct RT-LAMP with heat lysis) assays. The SLDM was validated in a clinical setting, highlighting the promise of VLPs as positive controls for molecular assays.","Chan, Soo Khim; Du, Pinyi; Ignacio, Caroline; Mehta, Sanjay; Newton, Isabel G; Steinmetz, Nicole F",Biomacromolecules,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.biomac.0c01727; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33539086/,8

Studies suggest some psychiatric disorders are associated with differences in discounting compared with controls, but null findings have also been reported. Objective To conduct a meta-analysis of the published literature on delay discounting in people with psychiatric disorders. Data Sources PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycInfo, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched through December 10, 2018. The psychiatric keywords used were based on DSM-IV or DSM-5 diagnostic categories. Collected data were analyzed from December 10, 2018, through June 1, 2019. Study Selection Following a preregistered Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol, 2 independent raters reviewed titles, abstracts, and full-text articles. English-language articles comparing monetary delay discounting between participants with psychiatric disorders and controls were included. Data Extraction and Synthesis Hedges g effect sizes were computed and random-effects models were used for all analyses. Heterogeneity statistics, one-study-removed analyses, and publication bias indices were also examined. Main Outcomes and Measures Categorical comparisons of delay discounting between a psychiatric group and a control group. Results The sample included 57 effect sizes from 43 studies across 8 diagnostic categories. Significantly steeper discounting for individuals with a psychiatric disorder compared with controls was observed for major depressive disorder (Hedges g = 0.37; P = .002; k = 7), schizophrenia (Hedges g = 0.46; P = .004; k = 12), borderline personality disorder (Hedges g = 0.60; P < .001; k = 8), bipolar disorder (Hedges g = 0.68; P < .001; k = 4), bulimia nervosa (Hedges g = 0.41; P = .001; k = 4), and binge-eating disorder (Hedges g = 0.34; P = .001; k = 7). In contrast, anorexia nervosa exhibited statistically significantly shallower discounting (Hedges g = -0.30; P < .001; k = 10). Modest evidence of publication bias was indicated by a statistically significant Egger test for schizophrenia and at the aggregate level across studies. Conclusions and Relevance Results of this study appear to provide empirical support for delay discounting as a transdiagnostic process across most of the psychiatric disorders examined; the literature search also revealed limited studies in some disorders, notably posttraumatic stress disorder, which is a priority area for research.","Amlung, Michael; Marsden, Emma; Holshausen, Katherine; Morris, Vanessa; Patel, Herry; Vedelago, Lana; Naish, Katherine R; Reed, Derek D; McCabe, Randi E",JAMA psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2019.2102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31461131/,8

Carotid stenting was successful in all cases, and establishment of Thrombolysis in Cerebral Ischemia 2A, 2B or 3 flow was successful in 21/23 (91%). 12/23 (52%) patients achieved a modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 90 days. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (SICH) occurred in 5/23 patients (22%). Of 13 patients receiving an intravenous loading dose of abciximab during the procedure, 4/13 had SICH (31%) compared with 1/10 (10%) of those who did not. Of seven patients who received intravenous tissue plasminogen activator prior to the procedure, none had SICH. 90-day mortality was 9/23 (39%). All patients who had SICH were above the median age. CONCLUSIONS Primary stenting of the extracranial carotid artery combined with intracranial mechanical thrombectomy can be an effective treatment for tandem occlusions, can be performed with a high rate of technical success, and can achieve good clinical outcomes in selected patients. However, the incidence of SICH may be higher than in other patient populations and may be associated with the use of abciximab and advanced patient age.","Heck, Donald V; Brown, Morry D",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2014-011224; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25387730/,8

The cornerstone of therapy for early-stage lung cancer is surgical resection by lobectomy with concomitant removal of the draining nodal basin. Minimally invasive lobectomy with the use of a thoracoscope has been established as an alternative to standard thoracotomy approaches. Thoracoscopic lobectomy provides advantages over a traditional thoracotomy, including less pain, shorter hospitalization, decreased overall costs, superior chemotherapy compliance, and fewer overall complications. In light of these advantages and with evidence of oncologic equivalence, thoracoscopic lobectomy should be considered the gold standard for the treatment of early-stage lung cancer. This article details the technical strategies for performing thoracoscopic lobectomy and highlights the published evidence demonstrating its advantages over a traditional thoracotomy approach.","Hartwig, Matthew G; D'Amico, Thomas A",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2010.02.102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20493989/,8

Methods We conducted a 3 week-long single-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebocontrolled pilot study comparing change in colonic transit time (CTT) among patients with chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) and irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) treated for 21 days with either CSP01 hydrogel, active control (carboxymethylcellulose [CMC]) or placebo. CTT was measured using pre-treatment (7 days baseline) and end-of-treatment (last 7 days of treatment) wireless motility capsule transit testing. The primary endpoint was change in CTT. Results Forty subjects (20 CSP01; 11 CMC; 9 placebo) were enrolled and 38 completed the study. There was no significant change in mean CTT by treatment group (P = 0.297). In the placebo group, CTT increased by 15.3 minutes between baseline and end of treatment, increased by 366.4 minutes for CMC, and decreased by 727.4 minutes for CSP01. In post hoc analyses among those with CIC, mean CTT decreased by 1079 minutes for CSP01 (P = 0.025 compared to placebo), 919 minutes for CMC (P = 0.117 compared to placebo) and increased by 1113 minutes for placebo. Among patients with IBS-C, there was no significant difference in change in CTT for any treatment group. One subject in the CSP01 arm developed back pain attributed to constipation and withdrew without a second CTT measurement; there were no other adverse events. Conclusion CSP01 significantly decreased CTT compared to placebo among patients with CIC, but not IBSC.","Staller, Kyle; Barshop, Kenneth; Vélez, Christopher; Bailey, Abbey; Locascio, Joseph J; Chiquette, Elaine; Kuo, Braden",Journal of neurogastroenterology and motility,https://doi.org/10.5056/jnm20001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807749/,8

OBJECTIVE To establish the effect of the procedural time on the clinical outcomes of patients with AIS. METHODS Data from all consecutive patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy between September 2010 and July 2012 were analysed retrospectively. The variable of interest was procedural time (defined as time from groin puncture to final recanalization time). Outcome measures included the rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH, defined as any parenchymal hematoma-eg, PH-1/PH-2), final infarct volume, 90-day mortality, and independent functional outcomes (modified Rankin Scale 0-2) at 90 days. RESULTS The cohort included 242 patients with a mean age of 65.5±14.2 and median baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 20. 51% of the patients were female. The mean procedure time was significantly shorter in patients with a good outcome (86.7 vs 73.1 min, respectively, p=0.0228). Patients with SICH had significantly higher mean procedure time than patients without SICH (79.67 vs 104.5 min, respectively; p=0.0319), which remained significant when controlling for the previous factors (OR=0.974, 95% CI 0.957 to 0.991). No correlation was found between the volume of infarction and the procedure time (r=0.10996, p=0.0984). No association was seen between procedure time and 90-day mortality (77.8 vs 88.2 min in survivals vs deaths, respectively; p=0.0958). CONCLUSIONS Our data support an association between the risk of SICH and a longer procedure time, but no association between procedural times and the final infarction volume or long-term functional outcomes was found.","Kass-Hout, Tareq; Kass-Hout, Omar; Sun, Chung-Huan Johnny; Kass-Hout, Taha A; Nogueira, Raul; Gupta, Rishi",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2015-012157; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26833538/,8

However, two methods have been used most frequently: ""vessels first"" and ""hilar transection"". Aim To evaluate the outcomes of LS performed with these two different approaches. Material and methods It was an observational study based on retrospective analysis of consecutive patients undergoing LS in a tertiary referral surgical center in the period 1998-2017. We excluded patients with splenic trauma, initially submitted to open surgery, stapled transection of splenic hilum, partial resections of the spleen and other spleen-preserving procedures. Patients were divided into two groups: group 1 (""vessels first"") with 188 patients, and group 2 (""hilar transection"") with 287 patients. Results Mean operative time was shorter (p < 0.001) and blood loss was lower (p < 0.001) in group 2. The need for blood transfusions and the conversion rate were higher in group 1 (p = 0.044 and p = 0.003 respectively). There was no difference in intraoperative adverse events (p = 0.179). Overall postoperative morbidity did not differ between groups (p = 0.081) and we noted mortality of 0.21% (1 patient of group 2). The morbidity rate associated with accidental injury of the pancreatic parenchyma was significantly higher in group 1 (p = 0.028). Median length of hospital stay was 4 days (range: 1-99) and did not differ between groups (p = 0.175). Conclusions The ""vessels first"" technique is associated with longer operative time, higher blood loss and increased risk of conversion. ""Hilar transection"" is associated with lower incidence of local complications related most likely to accidental injury of the pancreatic tail. In the case of a large caliber of splenic vessels the ""vessels first"" approach remains the technique of choice.","Radkowiak, Dorota; Zychowicz, Anna; Wysocki, Michał; Lasek, Anna; Major, Piotr; Pędziwiatr, Michał; Budzyński, Piotr; Dembiński, Marcin; Dworak, Jadwiga; Budzynski, Andrzej",Wideochirurgia i inne techniki maloinwazyjne = Videosurgery and other miniinvasive techniques,https://doi.org/10.5114/wiitm.2018.76071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30524616/,8

Two groups of rabbits were studied to compare the effects of embolization on nitrite levels. In the control group, blood was continuously obtained from a jugular venous catheter. The blood was immediately passed through an ultrafiltration filter; the filtrate was chemically reduced to convert free nitrite to nitric oxide (NO) and then measured using a NO-specific electrode. In the embolized group, after a baseline nitrite level was achieved, blood clots were injected into the brain via the carotid artery catheter, and then nitrite levels were continuously measured from jugular venous blood. The stroke group showed a significantly greater increase in nitrite as compared to controls (p=0.017). Using the area-under-the-curve (AUC) method, results reached statistical significance (p<0.05) within 3 min of embolization. In embolized rabbits, NO(2) levels increased 424±256% compared to baseline. This study shows that nitrite can be measured immediately following a stroke and that our system measures nitrite independent of the extent of the stroke.

There is no standardised approach of how this should be instituted, but principles of distributive justice are commonly used so that patients who are most likely to benefit from the drug receive it. As a result, clinical indications, in which the evidence for the drug is assumed to be established, are often prioritised over research use. In this manuscript, we present a case of a phase II investigational trial of intravenous thiamine for delirium prevention in patients undergoing haematopoietic stem cell transplantation to emphasise several shortcomings in the overarching prioritisation of clinical over research uses of scarce drugs. Specifically, we present the following considerations: (1) clinical use may not have stronger evidence than research use; (2) a strong scientific rationale for research use may outweigh the claim for clinical indications in which there is weak evidence; (3) treatment within the context of a clinical trial may be the standard of care; and (4) research use may not only benefit patients receiving the treatment but also offers the prospect of improving future clinical care. In summary, we argue against allocation schemes that prohibit all research uses of scarce drugs and instead recommend that allocation schemes include a balanced approach that weighs risks and benefits of access to scarce drugs irrespective of the research versus clinical use designation.","Nakamura, Zev M; MacKay, Douglas P; Davis, Arlene M; Brassfield, Elizabeth R; Joyner, Benny L; Rosenstein, Donald L",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2020-106739; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33246996/,8

Current testing methods can identify specific viral respiratory pathogens, yet the approach to outbreak management remains general. Objectives Our aim was to examine pathogen-specific trends in respiratory outbreaks, including how attack rates, case fatality rates and outbreak duration differ by pathogen between hospitals and long-term care (LTC) and retirement homes (RH) in Ontario. Methods Confirmed respiratory outbreaks in Ontario hospitals and LTC/RH reported between September 1, 2007, and August 31, 2017, were extracted from the integrated Public Health Information System (iPHIS). Median attack rates and outbreak duration and overall case fatality rates of pathogen-specific outbreaks were compared in both settings. Results Over the 10-year surveillance period, 9,870 confirmed respiratory outbreaks were reported in Ontario hospitals and LTC/RH. Influenza was responsible for most outbreaks (32% in LTC/RH, 51% in hospitals), but these outbreaks were shorter and had lower attack rates than most non-influenza outbreaks in either setting. Human metapneumovirus, while uncommon (<4% of outbreaks) had high case fatality rates in both settings. Conclusion Attack rates and case fatality rates varied by pathogen, as did outbreak duration. Development of specific outbreak management guidance that takes into account pathogen and healthcare setting may be useful to limit the burden of respiratory outbreaks.","Paphitis, Katherine; Achonu, Camille; Callery, Sandra; Gubbay, Jonathan; Katz, Kevin; Muller, Matthew; Sachdeva, Herveen; Warshawsky, Bryna; Whelan, Michael; Garber, Gary; Murti, Michelle",Canada communicable disease report = Releve des maladies transmissibles au Canada,https://doi.org/10.14745/ccdr.v47i56a04; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34220351/,8

It has been proven that COVID-19 can be transmitted from human to human and cause hospital infection, which seriously threatens surgical staffs and inpatients. Although colorectal surgery is not a front-line subject in the fight against the epidemic, but in this special situation, it is a difficult task to provide the highest quality medical services and ensure the orderly clinical work, on the premise of maximizing the protection for patients and their families, health of medical staff, and the safety of wards and hospitals, We summarize how to carry out the clinical practice of colorectal surgery under the situation of the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemiology, including the procedures of diagnose and treatment for emergency patients with colorectal tumor, and share the experiences of the diagnosis of colorectal tumor, the management of patients with colorectal cancer who are scheduled to be admitted for surgery, the protection of wards, the perioperative management. More importantly, we introduce in detail the operative management and perioperative management of colorectal surgery patients suspected or diagnosed with new coronary pneumonia, including prevention and control measures for medical staff, operating rooms and surgical instruments. The main points are as follows: (1) Multidisciplinary team (MDT) must be run through the diagnosis and treatment of colorectal cancer. The members include not only routine departments, but also respiratory department and infectious department. (2) Colonoscopy examination may cause cross infection of COVID-19 to patients and doctors. Therefore, it is prior to examine the emergency cases and life-threatening patients (bleeding, obstruction, gastrointestinal foreign bodies, etc.). If the emergent patients (intestinal obstruction) with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, the surgeons must perform emergency surgery, and intestinal decompressive tube through colonoscopy is not recommended. (3) The colorectal cancer patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 should be placed in the isolated room with separate medical devices, and the operative room with negative pressure (under -5 Pa) must be separated. All disposable medical items, body fluids and feces of the patients in perioperative periods must be unified disposed according to the medical waste standard. (4) The surgical medical workers who process colorectal cancer patients with COVID-19 must be protected by three-level.

64788,Correction notice.,2019-12-03,"The purpose of this case report was to describe a novel method to retrieve a herniated lumbar interbody cage. Transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (TLIF) is an increasingly popular method of spinal fixation and fusion. Unexpected retropulsion of an interbody is a rare event that can result in intractable pain or motor compromise necessitating surgical retrieval of the interbody. Both anterior and posterior approaches to removing migrated cages may be associated with significant surgical morbidity and mortality. A 60-year-old woman underwent an L4-S1 TLIF coupled with pedicle screw fixation at a previous hospital 5 years prior to admission. She noted sudden-onset bilateral lower extremity weakness and right-sided foot drop. Magnetic resonance imaging and radiographs were notable for purely centrally herniated interbody. A posterior, midline transdural approach was used to retrieve the interbody. Situated in between nerve rootlets to the ventral canal, this virgin corridor allowed us to easily visualize and protect neurological structures while safely retrieving the interbody. The patient experienced an immediate improvement in symptoms and was discharged on postoperative day 3. At 12-month follow-up, she had no evidence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak and had returned to normal activities of daily living. While the risk of CSF leak may be higher with a transdural approach, we maintain that avoiding unnecessary retraction of the nerve roots may outweigh this risk. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a transdural approach for the retrieval of a retropulsed lumbar interbody cage.","Zaidi, Hasan Aqdas; Shah, Ashish; Kakarla, Udaya Kumar",Asian journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.4103/1793-5482.165802; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26889290/,8

Patients may perceive the day of surgery as the biggest and the most threatening day in their lives. There is paucity of information on predictors of anxiety in the current study area. The main objective of this study is to assess predictors of preoperative anxiety among patients scheduled for surgery in Jimma University Specialized Teaching Hospital. METHODS A facility based cross-sectional study was conducted using quantitative data collection technique in Jimma University Specialized Teaching Hospital from February 13 to April 13, 2012 on 239 patients scheduled for surgery. The data were collected by five trained diploma nurses using structured interviewer administered questionnaires that were prepared based on state trait anxiety inventory measurement scale. The quantitative data were entered into SPSS for windows version 16. 0 and descriptive, simple and multiple linear regression analyses were performed. RESULTS A total of 239 patients were enrolled in the study with a response rate of 93.0%. Their mean age was 42.7 ± 1.8 years (range 16 to 85 years). Nearly over half 53.6% were females, while 48.1% illiterate, 72.4% Oromo and 56.5% were Muslim followers. Significant preoperative anxiety was seen in 70.3% patients. The most common factors that lead to anxiety were fear of death 38.1% and fear of unknown origin 24.3% and the most common strategy mentioned by patient in reducing anxiety were talking to other patient 79.8% and religious belief. CONCLUSIONS In the present study, two third 70.3% of preoperative patients had anxiety. Factors which were positively correlated with anxiety were trait anxiety, single and divorced, time of operation and income. Factors which were shown to reduce anxiety were preoperative anxiety related information provision and afternoon operation.

65636,Reply to I. Nishino and J. Tanboon.,2020-10-23,"BACKGROUND Epidemiological, pathological and radiological studies suggest that inflammatory demyelination in MS is an age-dependent process, and that the formation of focal inflammatory demyelinating lesions decreases with age. Gadolinium-enhancing lesions are a biomarker of inflammatory disease activity in MS, but little is known about the relation of age and gadolinium enhancement on cranial MRI scans in people with MS. In this study, we investigated the association of age and other risk factors with gadolinium enhancement on cranial MRI in a retrospective cross-sectional clinical MS cohort. METHODS In a cohort including 1543 people with CIS and MS, we investigated the association of the risk factors age, sex, disease course, immunomodulatory drug (IMD) treatment, and disability with gadolinium enhancement on cranial MRI scans using a binary logistic regression model. RESULTS Age was the most important factor associated with gadolinium enhancement, with the odds of gadolinium enhancement decreasing with advancing age. Participants with CIS had lower odds of gadolinium enhancement (odds ratio of 0.42, 95% confidence interval of 0.24-0.72 compared to RRMS). Sex, disease course and IMD treatment were not significantly associated with gadolinium enhancement in our cohort. CONCLUSIONS Our investigation shows that gadolinium enhancement is strongly associated with age. Since gadolinium enhancement is a marker of inflammatory disease activity, our findings suggest that inflammatory disease activity declines with age, and that IMD treatment may be more beneficial in younger and less useful in older people with MS.","Koch, Marcus W; Mostert, Jop; Greenfield, Jamie; Liu, Wei-Qiao; Metz, Luanne",Journal of neurology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00415-020-09895-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32388832/,8

Mann-Whitney U test, ROC analyses, and logistic regression analyses were used for complications. Cox-regression analyses were performed for outcome. Mean tumor diameter was 23.2 mm. Mean and median RENAL, mRENAL, ABLATE, and sABLATE scores were 6.8 and 7, 6.9 and 7, 5.3, and 5, and 3.5 and 3, respectively. During a mean follow-up of 21.9 months (range 1-73), we registered 7 complications, 3 cases of residual disease, and 10 local tumor progressions. Mann-Whitney U test p values for complications for RENAL, mRENAL, ABLATE, and sABLATE were 0.51, 0.49, 0.66, and 0.056, respectively. ROC analyses for complications showed an AUC for RENAL, mRENAL, ABLATE, and sABLATE of 0.57, 0.57, 0.55, and 0.71, respectively. Regarding outcome, HR and p values of Cox-regression analyses were 1.30 and 0.36 for RENAL, 1.33 and 0.35 for mRENAL, 2.16 and 0.01 for ABLATE, 2.29 and 0.004 for sABLATE. sABLATE was the only score close to significance for complications, representing a progress even if not definitive. Regarding outcome, ABLATE confirmed its value, and sABLATE maintained validity despite being a simplification.","Papa, Maurizio; Biondetti, Pierpaolo; Colombo, Roberta; Ierardi, Anna Maria; Angileri, Salvatore Alessio; Lucignani, Gianpaolo; Boeri, Luca; Montanari, Emanuele; Cardone, Gianpiero; Scagnelli, Paola; Carrafiello, Gianpaolo",Medical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12032-021-01542-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34495438/,8

66373,Advances and future directions in interventional pulmonology.,2013,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a global public health concern that can be classified as mild, moderate, severe, or critical, based on disease severity. Since the identification of critical patients is crucial for developing effective management strategies, we evaluated clinical characteristics, laboratory data, treatment provided, and oxygenation to identify potential predictors of mortality among critical COVID-19 pneumonia patients. We retrospectively utilized data from seven critical patients who were admitted to our hospital during April 2020 and required mechanical ventilation. The primary endpoint was to clarify potential predictor of mortality. All patients were older than 70 years, five were men, six had hypertension, and three ultimately died. Compared with survivors, non-survivors tended to be never smokers (0 pack-years vs. 30 pack-years, p = 0.08), to have higher body mass index (31.3 kg/m2 vs. 25.3 kg/m2, p = 0.06), to require earlier tracheal intubation after symptom onset (2.7 days vs. 5.5 days, p = 0.07), and had fewer lymphocytes on admission (339 /μL vs. 518 /μL, p = 0.05). During the first week after tracheal intubation, non-survivors displayed lower values for minimum ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen to fractional inspiratory oxygen concentration (P/F ratio) (44 mmHg vs. 122 mmHg, p < 0.01) and poor response to intensive therapy compared with survivors. In summary, we show that obesity and lymphopenia could predict the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia and that the trend of lower P/F ratio during the first week of mechanical ventilation could provide useful prognostic information.","Kishaba, Tomoo; Maeda, Akiko; Nabeya, Daijiro; Nagano, Hiroaki",The Tohoku journal of experimental medicine,https://doi.org/10.1620/tjem.252.103; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32938838/,8

The benefits of telemedicine visits with a Pediatric Rehabilitation Medicine (PRM) provider, also known as telerehabilitation medicine visits, are numerous. Telerehabilitation medicine provides an opportunity to deliver timely, patient and family-centric rehabilitation care while maintaining physical distance and reducing potential COVID-19 exposure for our patients, their caregivers and medical providers. Telerehabilitation medicine also allows for access to PRM care in rural areas or areas without medical specialty, virtual in-home equipment evaluation, and reduced travel burden. Because of these and many other benefits, telerehabilitation medicine will likely become part of our ongoing model of care if barriers to telemedicine continue to be lowered or removed. This paper is intended to establish a foundation for pediatric telerehabilitation medicine visit efficiency and effectiveness in our current environment and into the future.","Rabatin, Amy E; Lynch, Mary E; Severson, Matthew C; Brandenburg, Joline E; Driscoll, Sherilyn W",Journal of pediatric rehabilitation medicine,https://doi.org/10.3233/prm-200748; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33136081/,8

The aim of this systematic review is to investigate the relationship between AD and bone mineral density (BMD), osteoporosis and fractures. We searched Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE and Embase. Title, abstract and full text screening, and data abstraction were done in duplicate. Quality appraisal was performed using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality Methodology Checklist (cross-sectional studies) and Newcastle Ottawa Scale (cohort studies). We screened 3800 abstracts and included fifteen studies (twelve cross-sectional, three cohort). In cross-sectional studies, AD was associated with decreased BMD and increased fractures. In cross-sectional studies and a cohort study, AD was associated with a higher prevalence of osteoporosis compared to controls. There was inconsistency across studies, with some finding no association. In a large cohort study, AD was associated with increased risk of fractures of the hip (HR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.11), spine (HR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.23) and wrist (HR: 1.06, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.10), with further increased risk with more severe AD. Differences between studies precluded quantitative synthesis. There is some evidence supporting an association between AD and poor bone health.

How cells maintain Fe-S cluster homeostasis is not well understood in Gram-positive bacteria. Genomic analysis showed that the Suf system, which is encoded by the sufRBDCSU operon, is the sole Fe-S cluster assembly system in the genus Streptomyces Streptomyces avermitilis is the industrial producer of avermectins, which are widely used as agricultural pesticides and antiparasitic agents. sufR (SAV6324) encodes a putative ArsR-family transcriptional regulator, which was characterized as a repressor of the sufRBDCSU operon in this investigation. Spectroscopy and mass spectrometry demonstrated that anaerobically isolated SufR contained an oxidation-sensitive [4Fe-4S] cluster and existed as a homodimer. EMSAs and DNase I footprinting analyses revealed that [4Fe-4S]-SufR bound specifically and tightly to a 14-bp palindromic sequence (CAAC-N6-GTTG) in the promoter region of the sufR operon, repressing expression of the sufRBDCSU operon. The presence of the [4Fe-4S] cluster is critical for the DNA binding activity of SufR. Cys182, Cys195, and Cys223 in the C-terminal region of SufR are essential for [4Fe-4S] cluster coordination, but Cys178 is not. The fourth non-Cys ligand in coordination of the [4Fe-4S] cluster for SufR remains to be identified. The findings clarify the transcriptional control of the suf operon by [4Fe-4S] SufR to satisfy the varying Fe-S cluster demands. SufR senses the intracellular Fe-S cluster status and modulates the expression of the sole Fe-S cluster assembly system via its Fe-S cluster occupancy.Importance Fe-S clusters function as cofactors of proteins controlling diverse biological processes such as respiration, photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, DNA replication and gene regulation. The mechanism of how Actinobacteria regulate the expression of the sole Fe-S cluster assembly system in response to the varying Fe-S cluster demands remains to be elucidated. In this study, we showed that SufR functions as a transcriptional repressor of the sole Fe-S cluster assembly system in the avermectin-producer S. avermitilis [4Fe-4S]-SufR binds to the promoter region of the suf operon and represses its expression. When Fe-S cluster is insufficient, SufR loses its [4Fe-4S] cluster and DNA binding activity. Apo-SufR dissociates from the promoter region of suf operon, and the expression of the suf system is strongly increased by de-repression to promote the synthesis of Fe-S clusters. The study clarifies how Streptomyces maintains its Fe-S cluster homeostasis through the activity of SufR to modulate the varying Fe-S cluster demands.","Cheng, Yaqing; Lyu, Mengya; Yang, Renjun; Wen, Ying; Song, Yuan; Li, Jilun; Chen, Zhi",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.01523-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680866/,8

68734,Small-bowel capsule endoscopy and device-assisted enteroscopy for diagnosis and treatment of small-bowel disorders: European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ESGE) Clinical Guideline.,2015,"INTRODUCTION Esophageal Injury during atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation is a life-threatening complication. We sought to measure the association of esophageal temperature attenuation with radiofrequency (RF) electrode impedance, contact force, and distance from the esophagus. METHODS The retrospective study cohort included 35 patients with mean age 64±10 years, of whom 74.3% were male, and 40% had persistent AF. All patients had undergone pre-procedural cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) followed by AF ablation with luminal esophageal temperature monitoring. Lesion locations were co-registered with CMR image segmentations of left atrial and esophageal anatomy. Luminal esophageal temperature, time matched RF lesion data, and ablation distance from the nearest esophageal location were collected as panel data. RESULTS Luminal esophageal temperature changes corresponding to 3667 distinct lesions, delivered with mean power 27.9±5.5 Watts over a mean duration of 22.2±10.5 seconds were analyzed. In multivariable analyses, clustered per patient, examining posterior wall lesions only, and adjusted for lesion power and duration as set by the operator, lesion distance from the esophagus (-0.003°C/mm, P<0.001), and baseline impedance (-0.015°C/Ω, P<0.001) were associated with changes in luminal esophageal temperature. CONCLUSION Esophageal luminal temperature rises are associated with shorter lesion distance from esophagus and lower baseline impedance during RF lesion delivery. When procedural strategy requires RF delivery near the esophagus, selection of sites with higher baseline impedance may improve safety. This article is protected by copyright.

In this work, we calculate the conductance of a series of acene derivatives connected to gold electrodes using density functional theory (DFT) combined with the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) formalism. We show that these systems have near length-independent conductance and can exhibit a conductance increase with molecular length depending on the connection to the electrodes. The analysis of the molecular orbital energies and transmission functions attribute this behavior to the dramatic decrease of the highest occupied molecular orbital-lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO-LUMO) gap with length, which shifts the transmission peaks near the Fermi level. These results demonstrate that the anchoring configuration determines the conductance behavior of acene derivatives, which are optimal building blocks to fabricate single-molecule devices with tunable charge transport properties.","Valdiviezo, Jesús; Rocha, Paulina; Polakovsky, Anastazia; Palma, Julio L",ACS sensors,https://doi.org/10.1021/acssensors.0c02049; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33411533/,8
69324,Impact of sufficient contact between the autograft and endplate soon after surgery to prevent nonunion at 12 months following posterior lumbar interbody fusion.,2020-08-07,"INTRODUCTION VEGF-C156S, a lymphangiogenesis-specific form of vascular endothelial growth factor C (VEGF-C), has been considered as a promising candidate for the experimental pro-lymphangiogenic treatment, as it lacks potential angiogenic effects. As a precursor to future clinical trials, the therapeutic efficacy and blood vascular side effects of VEGF-C and VEGF-C156S were compared in a large animal model of secondary lymphedema. Combination of lymphatic growth factor treatment and autologous lymph node transfer was used to normalize the lymphatic anatomy after surgical excision of lymphatic tissue. METHODS Lymph vessels around the inguinal lymph node of female domestic pigs were destroyed in order to impair the normal lymphatic drainage from the hind limb. Local injections of adenoviruses (Ad) encoding VEGF-C or VEGF-C156S were used to enhance the regrowth of the lymphatic vasculature. AdLacZ (β-galactosidase) and saline injections served as controls. RESULTS Both VEGF-C and VEGF-C156S induced growth of new lymphatic vessels in the area of excision, although lymphangiogenesis was notably stronger after VEGF-C treatment. Also the transferred lymph nodes were best-preserved in the VEGF-C-treated pigs. Despite the enlargement of blood vessels following the VEGF-C therapy, no signs of sprouting angiogenesis or increased blood vascular permeability in the form of increased wound exudate volumes were observed. CONCLUSIONS Our results show that VEGF-C provides the preferred alternative for growth factor therapy of lymphedema when compared to VEGF-C156S, due to the superior lymphangiogenic response and minor blood vessel effects. Furthermore, these observations suggest that activation of both VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3 might be needed for efficient lymphangiogenesis.","Visuri, Mikko T; Honkonen, Krista M; Hartiala, Pauliina; Tervala, Tomi V; Halonen, Paavo J; Junkkari, Heikki; Knuutinen, Nina; Ylä-Herttuala, Seppo; Alitalo, Kari K; Saarikko, Anne M",Angiogenesis,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10456-015-9469-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26018927/,8

METHODS The HBS is a dual strategy based on a preoperative vascular work-up of the cerebral circulation by transcranial Doppler and a perioperative monitoring of the cerebral circulation by cerebral oximetry. Duplex of the carotid arteries and/or computed tomography angiography prior to surgery was performed in high-risk patients. Patients with severe carotid artery stenosis were scheduled for carotid angioplasty prior to surgery or waived from surgery. RESULTS A total of 1065 patients were included. Poor cerebral haemodynamics were identified by transcranial Doppler in 2.1% of patients (n = 22). Based on the HBS, 3 patients were waived from surgery, 4 received preoperative carotid angioplasty followed by cardiac surgery and the remaining patients were operated while being monitored with bilateral cerebral oximetry sensors. In all, 2.2% of the study group experienced a stroke (n = 23), of which none were classified as haemodynamic. Most of the remaining presumed embolic strokes showed a minor to moderate stroke severity.

This study investigated podiatrist's perceptions and satisfaction surrounding mandatory CPD requirements following the implementation of a new 2-year CPD programme. METHODS A cross-sectional study of NZ registered podiatrists was conducted between October 9th and December 9th, 2020. Data was collected using a web-based survey. The 39-item survey included questions to elicit participant characteristics, perceptions of CPD, difficulties undertaking CPD, and satisfaction with the new CPD programme. The survey findings were reported using descriptive statistics and conventional content analysis. RESULTS One hundred and thirty-four podiatrists completed the survey. Most respondents worked in private practice (n = 107, 80 %), were in full-time employment (n = 83, 62 %), and had greater than 16 years of work experience (n = 73, 54 %). Respondents agreed it was important to engage in CPD (n = 126, 94 %) and reported that knowledge gained from CPD contributed to their daily work (n = 78, 58 %). 44 % (n = 58) reported difficulties keeping up to date with CPD. The main barriers to CPD participation reported were workload (n = 90, 67 %) and lack of time (n = 84, 63 %). Three categories (understanding the CPD programme; access to CPD; and time to complete CPD) were identified from the qualitative analysis to describe why it was difficult to meet CPD requirements. CONCLUSIONS NZ podiatrists value CPD and are satisfied with most aspects of the mandatory CPD programme apart from the hours attributed to compulsory activities. The current approach to cultural safety CPD requires revision, with a move away from a time-based approach to a system that promotes an understanding and relevance to practice. Lack of time, practice workload, financial barriers, geographical location, and employment context were factors that influenced a practitioner's ability to engage in CPD. Facilitation of CPD activities that are flexible to ensure relevance to the practitioner's specific work within their scope of practice, and that can occur in the workplace environment, may address barriers and increase engagement with to CPD activities.","Carroll, Matthew; Brenton-Rule, Angela; Jepson, Hannah; Molyneux, Prue",Journal of foot and ankle research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13047-021-00492-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34496936/,8

Handling large numbers of small multiples imposes challenges on many analytic tasks like inspection, comparison, navigation, or annotation. To address these challenges, we developed a framework and implemented a library called PILING.JS for designing interactive piling interfaces. Based on the piling metaphor, such interfaces afford flexible organization, exploration, and comparison of large numbers of small multiples by interactively aggregating visual objects into piles. Based on a systematic analysis of previous work, we present a structured design space to guide the design of visual piling interfaces. To enable designers to efficiently build their own visual piling interfaces, PILING.JS provides a declarative interface to avoid having to write low-level code and implements common aspects of the design space. An accompanying GUI additionally supports the dynamic configuration of the piling interface. We demonstrate the expressiveness of PILING.JS with examples from machine learning, immunofluorescence microscopy, genomics, and public health.","Lekschas, Fritz; Zhou, Xinyi; Chen, Wei; Gehlenborg, Nils; Bach, Benjamin; Pfister, Hanspeter",IEEE transactions on visualization and computer graphics,https://doi.org/10.1109/tvcg.2020.3028948; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33026994/,8

71375,Norepinephrine may be an underlying factor in chemobrain.,2021-03-06,"Diffusion MRI (dMRI) represents one of the few methods for mapping brain fiber orientations non-invasively. Unfortunately, dMRI fiber mapping is an indirect method that relies on inference from measured diffusion patterns. Comparing dMRI results with other modalities is a way to improve the interpretation of dMRI data and help advance dMRI technologies. Here, we present methods for comparing dMRI fiber orientation estimates with optical imaging of fluorescently labeled neurofilaments and vasculature in 3D human and primate brain tissue cuboids cleared using CLARITY. The recent advancements in tissue clearing provide a new opportunity to histologically map fibers projecting in 3D, which represents a captivating complement to dMRI measurements. In this work, we demonstrate the capability to directly compare dMRI and CLARITY in the same human brain tissue and assess multiple approaches for extracting fiber orientation estimates from CLARITY data. We estimate the three-dimensional neuronal fiber and vasculature orientations from neurofilament and vasculature stained CLARITY images by calculating the tertiary eigenvector of structure tensors. We then extend CLARITY orientation estimates to an orientation distribution function (ODF) formalism by summing multiple sub-voxel structure tensor orientation estimates. In a sample containing part of the human thalamus, there is a mean angular difference of 19o±15o between the primary eigenvectors of the dMRI tensors and the tertiary eigenvectors from the CLARITY neurofilament stain. We also demonstrate evidence that vascular compartments do not affect the dMRI orientation estimates by showing an apparent lack of correspondence (mean angular difference = 49o±23o) between the orientation of the dMRI tensors and the structure tensors in the vasculature stained CLARITY images. In a macaque brain dataset, we examine how the CLARITY feature extraction depends on the chosen feature extraction parameters. By varying the volume of tissue over which the structure tensor estimates are derived, we show that orientation estimates are noisier with more spurious ODF peaks for sub-voxels below 30 µm3 and that, for our data, the optimal gray matter sub-voxel size is between 62.5 µm3 and 125 µm3. The example experiments presented here represent an important advancement towards robust multi-modal MRI-CLARITY comparisons.","Leuze, C; Goubran, M; Barakovic, M; Aswendt, M; Tian, Q; Hsueh, B; Crow, A; Weber, E; Steinberg, G; Zeineh, M; Plowey, E; Daducci, A; Innocenti, G; Thiran, J-P; Deisseroth, K; McNab, J A",NeuroImage,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117692; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385546/,8

Hospital-based simulation training requires a new approach. The realities of social distancing and the operational demands of hospital staffing ratios warrant creative adaptations of traditional simulation training methods. Hospitals used simulation to improve patient outcomes by training healthcare staff and students through telesimulation, and tested systems and equipment using in situ simulation (ISS). Latent safety threats (LSTs) were identified and corrected to improve patient outcomes. Hospital-based simulation has been incorporated into newly licensed registered nurses (NLRNs) residency programs to prepare them for competent practice. Simulations are also used for preparing staff for low-incidence, high-risk medical emergencies or disasters, such as active shooter events. Hospital-based simulation training adds value to healthcare systems, but requires more evidence of its quantitative and qualitative impacts.","Wang, J Cedar; Podlinski, Lori",Annual review of nursing research,https://doi.org/10.1891/0739-6686.39.83; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33431638/,8

Nous avons exploré les effets des interventions non pharmacologiques sur la transmission projetée du SRAS-CoV-2 au Canada. MÉTHODES: Nous avons créé un modèle de la population canadienne à base d’agents intégrant l’âge qui simule les effets des mesures de santé publique, selon leur intensité actuelle et projetée, sur la transmission du SRAS-CoV-2. Les mesures étudiées sont le dépistage et l’isolement des cas, la recherche de contacts et la mise en quarantaine, l’éloignement sanitaire et la fermeture des espaces partagés. Nous avons évalué l’effet des mesures prises individuellement et celui des mesures combinées. RÉSULTATS: En l’absence de mesures, 64,6 % (intervalle de crédibilité [ICr] à 95 % : 63,9 %–65,0 %) des Canadiens contracteraient le SRAS-CoV-2 (taux d’attaque global), et 3,6 % (ICr à 95 % 2,4 %–3,8 %) des personnes infectées en mourraient. En poursuivant le dépistage et la recherche de contacts à la même intensité que pendant la période de référence, sans maintenir l’éloignement sanitaire ou refermer certains endroits, le pays connaîtrait un taux d’attaque global de 56,1 % (ICr à 95 % 0,05 %–57,1 %); si ces mesures étaient accrues, le taux d’attaque chuterait à 0,4 % (ICr à 95 % 0,03 %–23,5 %). En combinant ce dernier scénario et le maintien de l’éloignement sanitaire, le taux tomberait à 0,2 % (ICr à 95 % 0,03 %–1,7 %). Ce scénario est le seul qui garderait la demande en soins hospitaliers et intensifs sous la capacité, qui préviendrait presque tous les décès et qui mettrait fin à l’épidémie. La prolongation de la fermeture des écoles aurait un effet minime, mais réduirait la transmission en milieu scolaire. Par contre, la prolongation de la fermeture des lieux de travail et des lieux publics réduirait de manière marquée le taux d’attaque et mettait habituellement ou toujours fin à l’épidémie, selon les différents scénarios simulés. INTERPRÉTATION: Le contrôle de la transmission du SRAS-CoV-2 passera par l’amélioration et le maintien des mesures, tant communautaires qu’individuelles. Autrement, il y aura une recrudescence de l’épidémie, et un risque de surcharger le système de santé.","Ng, Victoria; Fazil, Aamir; Waddell, Lisa A; Bancej, Christina; Turgeon, Patricia; Otten, Ainsley; Atchessi, Nicole; Ogden, Nicholas H",CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne,https://doi.org/10.1503/cmaj.200990-f; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33257338/,8

Yet we do not know what behavioral characteristics of dogs and their owners are relevant to dog training or if owner cognitive abilities play a role in training success. The aim of this study is to determine which characteristics of both dogs and owners predict success in completing the American Kennel Club Canine Good Citizen training program. Before the first session of a dog training course, owners completed surveys evaluating the behavior and cognition of their dog and themselves. Additionally, we collected the dogs' initial training levels via behavioral tasks. We then examined what factors predicted whether the dogs passed the Canine Good Citizen test after the class ended. In terms of dog characteristics, we found that, while dog age, sex and neuter status did not predict success, owner-rated levels of disobedience did predict completion of the program. In terms of owner characteristics, owners who scored higher on cognitive measures were more likely to have their dogs complete the program. Finally, dog-owner characteristics such as the time spent training predicted success. Thus, characteristics of the dogs, owners, and how they interact seem to predict training success. These findings suggest that there are some owner, dog, and dog-owner characteristics that can facilitate or hinder dog training.","Stevens, Jeffrey R; Wolff, London M; Bosworth, Megan; Morstad, Jill",Animal cognition,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-020-01458-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423147/,8

We report a framework for estimating the risk of transmitting SARS-CoV-2 via aerosols in laboratory and office settings, based on an exponential dose-response model and analysis of air flow and purification in typical heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. High-circulation HVAC systems with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration dramatically reduce exposure to the virus in indoor settings, and surgical masks or N95 respirators further reduce exposure. As an example of our risk assessment model, we consider the precautions needed for a typical experimental physical science group to maintain a low risk of transmission over six months of operation. We recommend that, for environments where fewer than five individuals significantly overlap, work spaces should remain vacant for between one (high-circulation HVAC with HEPA filtration) to six (low-circulation HVAC with no filtration) air exchange times before a new worker enters in order to maintain no more than 1% chance of infection over six months of operation in the workplace. Our model is readily applied to similar settings that are not explicitly given here. We also provide a framework for evaluating infection mitigation through ventilation in multiple occupancy spaces.","Augenbraun, Benjamin L; Lasner, Zack D; Mitra, Debayan; Prabhu, Sridhar; Raval, Shivam; Sawaoka, Hiromitsu; Doyle, John M",Journal of occupational and environmental hygiene,https://doi.org/10.1080/15459624.2020.1805117; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32960737/,8

72825,The Invisible Hand - Medical Care during the Pandemic.,2020-04-02,"Cells possess a variety of organelles with characteristic structure and subcellular localization intimately linked to their specific function. While most are intracellular and found in virtually all eukaryotic cells, there is a small group of organelles of elongated cylindrical shapes in highly specialized cells that protrude into the extracellular space, such as cilia, flagella and microvilli. The ATP required by intracellular organelles is amply available in the cytosol, largely generated by mitochondria. However, such is not the case for cilia and flagella, whose slender structures cannot accommodate mitochondria. These organelles consume massive amounts of ATP to carry out high energy-demanding functions, such as sensory transduction or motility. ATP from the nearest mitochondria or other reactions within the cell body is severely limited by diffusion and generally insufficient to fuel the entire length of cilia and flagella. These organelles overcome this fuel restriction by local generation of ATP, using mechanisms that vary depending on the nutrients that are available in their particular external environment. Here we review, with emphasis in mammals, the remarkable adaptations that cilia and flagella use to fuel their metabolic needs. Additionally, we discuss how a decrease in nutrients surrounding olfactory cilia might impair olfaction in COVID-19 patients.","Villar, Pablo S; Vergara, Cecilia; Bacigalupo, Juan",The FEBS journal,https://doi.org/10.1111/febs.15620; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33142020/,8

This scoping review aims to identify the preferred modalities for delivering CE to public health professionals and to determine how equity has been incorporated into public health training. METHODS Using the PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews as a guide, we searched four databases for peer-reviewed primary research studies that evaluated public health workforce CE modalities. RESULTS The review included 33 studies published between 1 January 2000 and 6 August 2019 from over 11 countries. Most articles broadly described their training audience as public health professionals employed by government or non-governmental organizations. Delivery methods included online, in-person or blended learning (combining online and in-person instruction). Learners strongly preferred self-directed approaches. Organizational support, including protected time for professional development during work hours, was an important enabler of training completion. Commonly cited barriers included course duration and a high number of contact hours. CONCLUSION Findings suggest that there is no single preferred training modality. We identified three elements that influence modality preference: design, delivery and organizational support. Modality should be determined by participants' location, needs and previous experiences to ensure the content is relevant and delivered in a way that equips learners to apply the knowledge gained.","Archer, Anya; Berry, Isha; Bajwa, Uttam; Kalda, Robyn; Di Ruggiero, Erica","Health promotion and chronic disease prevention in Canada : research, policy and practice",https://doi.org/10.24095/hpcdp.40.4.03; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32270669/,8

The PET surface was initially treated with three different plasma gases prior to cationization treatment with quaternary ammonium salt (Quat 188). Madder roots were used, to produce natural dyes for the green coloration of PET fabrics in both dyeing and printing processes. The color strength (K/S) was measured to study the influence of both plasma gases and the cationization treatment on the coloration of PET fabric. Exposure to nitrogen plasma gases prior to the cationization treatment showed promising results for efficient PET coloration, resulting in the selection of nitrogen as a working gas at a flow rate of 3 l/min. The results also demonstrated that by combining the nitrogen plasma technique and cationization treatment, PET fabric with a highly effective surface was obtained, resulting in improved coloration, wettability, tensile strength, and roughness properties.","Abdelghaffar, Fatma; Abdelghaffar, Rehab A; Rashed, Usama M; Ahmed, Hend M",Environmental science and pollution research international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-020-09081-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32418110/,8

The policy analysis specially stated that although the MSW recycling ratio (30%) is not particularly poor, the recovered percentage of plastics, glass and food waste in Hong Kong are extremely low. Based on the unfavourable outcomes and consequences for MSWM and governance in Hong Kong, a conclusion of negative correlation between the per capita MSW disposal rate and bureaucratic policy culture development, as well as positive correlation between recycling rate of low value items and economic policy culture development, can be made. With considering the key factors of benchmark indicators, socio-economic factors, driving force, and communication of MSW policy, conducive options and prospects are also developed for the attempt to provide insights to restructure MSWM and governance in Hong Kong in the next decade. First, the government can build up strategic innovation from a global benchmark case - MSWM and governance improvement from the South Korea case. Second, to create opportunities and conditions to develop high value biofuel from waste through flexible local environmental policies formulation and implementation. Third, shifting a front-line MSWM for governance structure reform.","Lee, Dao Sun","Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",https://doi.org/10.1177/0734242x20945185; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32755279/,8

Many risk factors are associated with a high mortality rate in COVID-19. Establishment of a common pathway among these risk factors could improve our understanding of COVID-19 severity and mortality. This review aims at establishing this common pathway and its possible effect on COVID-19 mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS The current review was executed in five consecutive stages starting from determining the risk factors of COVID-19 mortality and trying to find a common pathway among them depending on the available literature. This was followed by proposing a mechanism explaining how this common pathway could increase the mortality. Finally, its potential role in managing COVID-19 was proposed. RESULTS This review identified this common pathway to be a low baseline of reduced glutathione (i.e., GSH) level. In particular, this review provided an in-depth discussion regarding the pathophysiology by which COVID-19 leads to GSH depletion, tissue damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. In addition, the current review demonstrated how GSH depletion could result in failure of the immune system and rendering the end organs vulnerable to damage from the oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS This preclinical study shows that GSH depletion may have a central role in COVID-19 mortality and pathophysiology. Therefore, elevating the GSH level in tissues may decrease the severity and mortality rates of COVID-19.","Khanfar, A; Al Qaroot, B",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202012_24046; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33336769/,8

Since its debut as the tumor necrosis factor converting enzyme (TACE), ADAM-17 has been reported to be an indispensible regulator of almost every cellular event from proliferation to migration. The central role of ADAM-17 in cell regulation is rooted in its diverse array of substrates: cytokines, growth factors, and their receptors as well as adhesion molecules are activated or inactivated by their cleavage with ADAM-17. It is therefore not surprising that ADAM-17 is implicated in numerous human diseases including cancer, heart disease, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney fibrosis, Alzheimer's disease, and is a promising target for future treatments. The specific role of ADAM-17 in the pathophysiology of these diseases is very complex and depends on the cellular context. To exploit the therapeutic potential of ADAM-17, it is important to understand how its activity is regulated and how specific organs and cells can be targeted to inactivate or activate the enzyme.","Gooz, Monika",Critical reviews in biochemistry and molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.3109/10409231003628015; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20184396/,8
75084,Activity of regorafenib plus nivolumab.,2020-05-12,"In the last two decades, anti-cancer vaccines have yielded disappointing clinical results despite the fact that high numbers of self/tumor-specific T cells can be elicited in immunized patients. Understanding the reasons behind this lack of efficacy is critical in order to design better treatment regimes. Recombinant lentivectors (rLVs) have been successfully used to induce antigen-specific T cells to foreign or mutated tumor antigens. Here, we show that rLV expressing a murine nonmutated self/tumor antigen efficiently primes large numbers of self/tumor-specific CD8(+) T cells. In spite of the large number of tumor-specific T cells, however, no anti-tumor activity could be measured in a therapeutic setting, in mice vaccinated with rLV. Accumulating evidence shows that, in the presence of malignancies, inhibition of T-cell activity may predominate overstimulation. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes revealed that specific anti-tumor CD8(+) T cells fail to produce cytokines and express high levels of inhibitory receptors such as programmed death (PD)-1. Association of active immunization with chemotherapy or antibodies that block inhibitory pathways often leads to better anti-tumor effects. We show here that combining rLV vaccination with either cyclophosphamide or PD-1 and PD-L1 blocking antibodies enhances rLV vaccination efficacy and improves anti-tumor immunity.","Sierro, Sophie R; Donda, Alena; Perret, Rachel; Guillaume, Philippe; Yagita, Hideo; Levy, Frédéric; Romero, Pedro",European journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.1002/eji.201041235; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21538347/,8

We observe that the time series of active cases in individual countries (the difference of the total number of confirmed infections and the sum of the total number of reported deaths and recovered cases) display a strong agreement with algebraic growth and at a later epidemic stage also with a combined algebraic growth with exponential decay. Our results are also formulated in terms of compartment type mathematical models of epidemics. Within these models the universal scaling characterizing the observed regime in an advanced epidemic stage can be interpreted as an algebraic decay of the relative reproduction number $R_0$ as $T_M/t$, where $T_M$ is a constant and $t$ is the duration of the epidemic outbreak. We show how our findings can be applied to improve predictions of the reported pandemic data and estimate some epidemic parameters.

Mental health and examining factors that may influence distress have been outlined as key research priorities to inform interventions. This research sought to examine whether intolerance of uncertainty and coping responses influence the degree of distress experienced by the U.K. general public during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using a cross-sectional online questionnaire design, participants were recruited (N = 842) using snowball sampling over a 10-day period in the early ""lockdown"" phase of the pandemic. Around a quarter of participants demonstrated significantly elevated anxiety and depression, with 14.8% reaching clinical cutoff for health anxiety. A one-way multivariate analysis of variance indicated those in ""vulnerable"" groups were significantly more anxious (p < .001), and also more anxious in relation to their health (p < .001). Mediation modeling demonstrated maladaptive coping responses partially mediated the predictive relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and psychological distress. Mental health difficulties have become significantly raised during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, particularly for the vulnerable. Findings support emerging research suggesting the general public is struggling with uncertainty, more so than normal. Vulnerable groups are more anxious about their health, but not more intolerant of uncertainty than the nonvulnerable. Finally, this study indicated two modifiable factors that could act as treatment targets when adapting interventions for mental health during the COVID-19 global health crisis.

METHODS From November 2011 to July 2013, 79 patients with 98 HCCs < 5 cm were enrolled and treated with RFA using a multi-channel switching radiofrequency system and a separable cluster electrode under the guidance of a real-time fusion imaging system. The primary and secondary endpoints were the 3-year local tumor progression (LTP) rate and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate, respectively. For post hoc analyses, LTP, RFS, and major complication rates were retrospectively compared with a historical control group treated with RFA using the same radiofrequency system but with multiple internally-cooled electrodes. RESULTS The technique success rate of the 98 tumors was 100%. Cumulative 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year LTP rates were 3.4%, 6.9%, and 12.4%, respectively. For patient-level data, cumulative 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year RFS rates were 83.9%, 68.6%, and 45.4%, respectively. On post hoc analyses, none of the baseline characteristics showed a significant difference between the separable cluster electrode and multiple internally-cooled electrodes group. Cumulative LTP and RFS rates of the two groups also showed no significant difference (p = 0.401 and p = 0.881, respectively). Finally, major complication rates of the separable cluster electrode group (5.0%, 4/79) and multiple internally-cooled electrodes group (5.9%, 4/74) were also comparable (p = 1.000). CONCLUSION Switching monopolar RFA using a separable cluster electrode is a feasible and efficient technique for the treatment of HCCs smaller than 5 cm, providing comparable local tumor control to multiple internally-cooled electrodes.

Methods Primary outcome measures included the GSV obliteration, with clinical recurrence on follow up as detected by serial clinical and duplex examinations of patients at 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year. Venous clinical severity score (VCSS), Aberdeen varicose vein questionnaire (AVVQ), Short Form Health Survey 36 Item (SF-36) questionnaires were used at clinical follow up. Diameter of the GSV, treatment length of the GSV, and pretreatment clinical severity of the varicose vein were analyzed to predict recanalization using Cox regression analysis. Results Fifty-seven legs in 29 patients with primary varicose veins were included. One week follow-up duplex showed successful obliteration of the GSV in all except one of the legs. Two legs had minimal extension of thrombus to deep vein. None of the patients had deep venous thrombosis. All the patients were discharged the same day of operation. Median time to return to work was 1 day (range 1-16 days). Our VCSS, AVVQ, and the SF-36 physical and mental scores changed from a mean of 6.91, 23.66, 44.24, 54.26 at baseline to 2.43, 6.10, 43.85, 52.50 at 1 month post operation, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the GSV closure rates were 98.2%, 94.3%, 89.7%, and 78.5% at post-op 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year, respectively. With median follow-up period of 9 months (range 1-13 months), no clinical recurrence of varicosity was observed. Mean GSV diameter ≥8 mm was a significant predictor for recanalization (hazard ratio 6.92, 95%CI 1.34-35.67, p = 0.021). Conclusion This study showed that the use of endovenous cyanoacrylate in the treatment of the GSV reflux was safe. All patients had symptomatic improvement as shown by the VCSS and AVVQ.","Chan, Yiu Che; Law, Yuk; Cheung, Grace C; Ting, Albert C; Cheng, Stephen W",Phlebology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0268355516638200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27052039/,8
76965,Brain pathology caused in the neonatal macaque by short and prolonged exposures to anticonvulsant drugs.,2020-12-29,"Primary cilia protrude from the cell surface and have diverse roles during development and disease, which depends on the precise timing and control of cilia assembly and disassembly. Inactivation of assembly often causes cilia defects and underlies ciliopathy, while diseases caused by dysfunction in disassembly remain largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that CEP55 functions as a cilia disassembly regulator to participate in ciliopathy. Cep55-/- mice display clinical manifestations of Meckel-Gruber syndrome, including perinatal death, polycystic kidneys, and abnormalities in the CNS. Interestingly, Cep55-/- mice exhibit an abnormal elongation of cilia on these tissues. Mechanistically, CEP55 promotes cilia disassembly by interacting with and stabilizing Aurora A kinase, which is achieved through facilitating the chaperonin CCT complex to Aurora A. In addition, CEP55 mutation in Meckel-Gruber syndrome causes the failure of cilia disassembly. Thus, our study establishes a cilia disassembly role for CEP55 in vivo, coupling defects in cilia disassembly to ciliopathy and further suggesting that proper cilia dynamics are critical for mammalian development.","Zhang, Yu-Cheng; Bai, Yun-Feng; Yuan, Jin-Feng; Shen, Xiao-Lin; Xu, Yu-Ling; Jian, Xiao-Xiao; Li, Sen; Song, Zeng-Qing; Hu, Huai-Bin; Li, Pei-Yao; Tu, Hai-Qing; Han, Qiu-Ying; Wang, Na; Li, Ai-Ling; Zhang, Xue-Min; Wu, Min; Zhou, Tao; Li, Hui-Yan",The Journal of cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202003149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33475699/,8

Hence, we aimed to evaluate the anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance and fear of COVID-19 among frontline doctors of Bangladesh during the pandemic, and the associated factors for these psychological symptoms. Methods: In total, 370 frontline doctors who were involved in the treatment of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients during the pandemic took part in an online cross-sectional study. Recruitment was completed using convenience sampling and the data were collected after the start of community transmission of COVID-19 in the country. Anxiety and depression, sleep disturbance, and fear of COVID-19 were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-4, two-item version of the Sleep Condition Indicator, and the Fear of Coronavirus-19 scale, respectively. Socio-demographic information, health service-related information, co-morbidity, and smoking history were collected for evaluating risk factors. The proportion of psychological symptoms were presented using descriptive statistics and the associated factors were identified using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Results: Of the doctors, 36.5% had anxiety, 38.4% had depression, 18.6% had insomnia, and 31.9% had fear of COVID-19. In multinomial logistic regression, inadequate resources in the workplace were found as the single most significant predictor for all psychological outcomes: anxiety and/or depression (severe, OR 3.0, p=0.01; moderate, OR 5.3, p=0.000; mild, OR 2.3, p=0.003), sleep disturbance (moderate, OR 1.9, p=0.02), and fear of COVID-19 (severe, OR 1.9, p=0.03; moderate, OR 1.8, p=0.03). Conclusions: The study demonstrated a high burden of psychological symptoms among frontline doctors of Bangladesh during the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Inadequate resources are contributing to the poor mental health of Bangladeshi doctors. The supply of sufficient resources in workplaces and mental health counseling may help to mitigate the burden of the psychological symptoms identified among the respondents..","Barua, Lingkan; Zaman, Muhammed Shahriar; Omi, Fardina Rahman; Faruque, Mithila",F1000Research,https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.27189.3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33447383/,8

BtBoV showed a higher detection rate in alimentary samples of Rhinolophus sinicus (5.7 %) than those of other bat species (0.43-1.59 %), supporting R. sinicus as the primary reservoir and virus spillover to accidental bat species. BtBoV peaked during the lactating season of R. sinicus, and it was more frequently detected among female than male adult bats (P<0.05), and among lactating than non-lactating female bats (P<0.0001). Positive BtBoV detection was associated with lower body weight in lactating bats (P<0.05). Ten nearly complete BtBoV genomes from three bat species revealed a unique large ORF1 spanning NS1 and NP1 in eight genomes and conserved splicing signals leading to multiple proteins, as well as a unique substitution in the conserved replication initiator motif within NS1. BtBoV was phylogenetically distantly related to known bocaparvoviruses with ≤57.3 % genome identities, supporting BtBoV as a novel species. Ms-BtBoV from Miniopterus schreibersii and Hp-BtBoV from Hipposideros pomona demonstrated 97.2-99.9 % genome identities with Rs-BtBoVs from R. sinicus, supporting infection of different bat species by a single BtBoV species. Rs-BtBoV_str15 represents the first bat parvovirus genome with non-coding regions sequenced, which suggested the presence of head-to-tail genomic concatamers or episomal forms of the genome. This study represents the first to describe interspecies transmission in BoVs.

79826,A comparative study of perioperative techniques to attain negative margins and spare healthy breast tissue in breast conserving surgery.,2020-08-17,"OBJECTIVE Approximately three million people in the US have hard-to-heal pressure ulcers (PUs), including 10% of hospitalised patients. Healing depends on ulcer stage and patient comorbidities. Despite advances in nutrition and wound care, PUs can take months or years to reach complete closure. To date, clinical studies have focused on single modality therapy. However, there is no one therapy that can address all of the deficits in these complex, hard-to-heal wounds. A commonly used treatment for PUs, negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), has demonstrated improved healing in Stage 3 and 4 PUs. NPWT entails applying suction to a porous sponge fitted into the wound cavity and sealed with an occlusive dressing. Negative pressure facilitates wound healing by removing wound fluid containing harmful proteases, stimulating the formation of granulation tissue and promoting wound contracture. However, it does not affect biofilm formation. We hypothesised that adding an antibiofilm agent might increase the effectiveness of NPWT in recalcitrant PUs. METHOD A prospective case series was conducted in outpatient wound care centres and a skilled nursing facility to examine the combination of a biofilm-disrupting antimicrobial agent (Blast-X, Next Science, US) in combination with NPWT (VAC, 3M, US) in healing and reducing bacterial burden in treatment-resistant pressure ulcers. Patients consented to application of the antibiofilm agent and NPWT three times per week for four weeks. The wounds were measured, imaged for bacteria and tested for host and bacterial protease activity weekly. RESULTS Of the 10 patients, four dropped out of the study before the end of the four weeks. Of the remaining six, four patients experienced a reduction in wound surface area and volume, reduced protease activity and lower bacterial levels. CONCLUSION The results of this study showed that multimodal therapy, including NPWT and biofilm disruption, may restart the healing of stagnant treatment-resistant PUs.","Serena, Thomas E; Jalodi, Omar; Serena, Laura; Patel, Keyur; Mynti, Matthew",Journal of wound care,https://doi.org/10.12968/jowc.2021.30.1.9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33439086/,8

80321,Neuroinflammaging underlies emotional disturbances and circadian rhythm disruption in young male senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 mice.,2020-10-15,"BACKGROUND The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has resulted in a rapid pivot toward telemedicine owing to closure of in-person elective clinics and sustained efforts at physical distancing worldwide. Throughout this period, there has been revived enthusiasm for delivering and receiving orthopaedic care remotely. Unfortunately, rapidly published editorials and commentaries during the pandemic have not adequately conveyed findings of published randomized trials on this topic. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES In this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials, we asked: (1) What are the levels of patient and surgeon satisfaction with the use of telemedicine as a tool for orthopaedic care delivery? (2) Are there differences in patient-reported outcomes between telemedicine visits and in-person visits? (3) What is the difference in time commitment between telemedicine and in-person visits? METHODS In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a systematic review with the primary objective to determine patient and surgeon satisfaction with telemedicine, and secondary objectives to determine differences in patient-reported outcomes and time commitment. We used combinations of search keywords and medical subject headings around the terms ""telemedicine"", ""telehealth"", and ""virtual care"" combined with ""orthopaedic"", ""orthopaedic surgery"" and ""randomized."" We searched three medical databases (MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library) in duplicate and performed manual searches to identify randomized controlled trials evaluating the outcomes of telemedicine and in-person orthopaedic assessments. Trials that studied an intervention that was considered to be telemedicine (that is, any form of remote or virtual care including, but not limited to, video, telephone, or internet-based care), had a control group that comprised in-person assessments performed by orthopaedic surgeons, and were reports of Level I original evidence were included in this study. Studies evaluating physiotherapy or rehabilitation interventions were excluded. Data was extracted by two reviewers and quantitative and qualitive summaries of results were generated. Methodological quality of included trials was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool, which uniformly rated the trials at high risk of bias within the blinding categories (blinding of providers, patients, and outcome assessors). We screened 133 published articles; 12 articles (representing eight randomized controlled trials) met the inclusion criteria. There were 1008 patients randomized (511 to telemedicine groups and 497 to control groups). Subspecialties represented were hip and knee arthroplasty (two trials), upper extremity (two trials), pediatric trauma (one trial), adult trauma (one trial), and general orthopaedics (two trials). RESULTS There was no difference in the odds of satisfaction between patients receiving telemedicine care and those receiving in-person care (pooled odds ratio 0.89 [95% CI 0.40 to 1.99]; p = 0.79). There were also no differences in surgeon satisfaction (pooled OR 0.38 [95% CI 0.07 to 2.19]; p = 0.28) or among multiple patient-reported outcome measures that evaluated pain and function. Patients reported time savings, both when travel time was excluded (17 minutes shorter [95% CI 2 to 32]; p = 0.03) and when it was included (180 minutes shorter [95% CI 78 to 281]; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Evidence from heterogeneous randomized studies demonstrates that the use of telemedicine for orthopaedic assessments does not result in identifiable differences in patient or surgeon satisfaction compared with in-person assessments. Importantly, the source studies in this review did not adequately capture or report safety endpoints, such as complications or missed diagnoses. Future studies must be adequately powered to detect these differences to ensure patient safety is not compromised with the use of telemedicine. Although telemedicine may lead to a similar patient experience, surgeons should maintain a low threshold for follow-up with in-person assessments whenever possible in the absence of further safety data.

It has been recently proposed that COVID-19 is an endothelial disease. Indeed, the COVID-19 virus binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 (ACE2), which is expressed in endothelial cells. ACE2 could be implicated in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by endothelial dysfunction due to viral damage. Consequently, oxidative stress could prime these cells to acquire a pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory phenotype, predisposing patients to thromboembolic and vasculitic events and to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). This implies a pivotal role played by oxygen in the pathogenetic mechanism of COVID-19 disease, in that its availability would tune the oxidant state and consequent damage.","Panfoli, Isabella",Clinical medicine,https://doi.org/10.7861/clinmed.2020-0252; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32601125/,8

This result is in agreement with the observation that in vivo, N protein is not necessary for TGEV replication, but it is required for efficient transcription.","Zúñiga, Sonia; Cruz, Jazmina L G; Sola, Isabel; Mateos-Gómez, Pedro A; Palacio, Lorena; Enjuanes, Luis",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.02011-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19955314/,8
81275,How Effective is Neoadjuvant Endocrine Therapy (NET) in Downstaging the Axilla and Achieving Breast-Conserving Surgery?,2020-08-24,"Rationale Trials conducted decades ago demonstrated that carotid endarterectomy by skilled surgeons reduced stroke risk in asymptomatic patients. Developments in carotid stenting and improvements in medical prevention of stroke caused by atherothrombotic disease challenge understanding of the benefits of revascularization. Aim Carotid Revascularization and Medical Management for Asymptomatic Carotid Stenosis Trial (CREST-2) will test whether carotid endarterectomy or carotid stenting plus contemporary intensive medical therapy is superior to intensive medical therapy alone in the primary prevention of stroke in patients with high-grade asymptomatic carotid stenosis. Methods and design CREST-2 is two multicenter randomized trials of revascularization plus intensive medical therapy versus intensive medical therapy alone. One trial randomizes patients to carotid endarterectomy plus intensive medical therapy versus intensive medical therapy alone; the other, to carotid stenting plus intensive medical therapy versus intensive medical therapy alone. The risk factor targets of centrally directed intensive medical therapy are LDL cholesterol <70 mg/dl and systolic blood pressure <140 mmHg. Study outcomes The primary outcome is the composite of stroke and death within 44 days following randomization and stroke ipsilateral to the target vessel thereafter, up to four years. Change in cognition and differences in major and minor stroke are secondary outcomes. Sample size Enrollment of 1240 patients in each trial provides 85% power to detect a treatment difference if the event rate in the intensive medical therapy alone arm is 4.8% higher or 2.8% lower than an anticipated 3.6% rate in the revascularization arm. Discussion Management of asymptomatic carotid stenosis requires contemporary randomized trials to address whether carotid endarterectomy or carotid stenting plus intensive medical therapy is superior in preventing stroke beyond intensive medical therapy alone. Whether carotid endarterectomy or carotid stenting has favorable effects on cognition will also be tested.

Growing reports argue about the potential benefits of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in reducing morbidity and mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but with inconsistent results.This study aimed to assess the potential benefits of HCQ on viral conversion, reducing the need for ICU or mechanical ventilation, and its impact on mortality. MATERIAL AND METHODS This retrospective observational study was conducted enrolling confirmed SARS-CoV2 patients. They were subjected to plain CXR (HRCT of chest if needed), routine laboratory tests for COVID-19 (including CBC, CRP, LDH, D-Dimer, ferritin, and blood sugar), ECG, and blood gases. They were allocated to either HCQ or non-HCQ groups. Both groups were followed-up for symptoms resolution, need for ICU admission, non-invasive or invasive ventilation, duration till conversion, and mortality. RESULTS A total of 202 patients with moderate COVID-19 were enrolled with a mean age of 55.05±10.15, out of whom 80% were male patients. The most common presenting symptom was fever (87.38% in the control group versus 92% in the HCQ group), followed by cough (82.52% versus 89.9%). In total, 24.27% of patients in the control group versus 28.3% in the HCQ group deteriorated and necessitated ICU admission (p=0.52), 13.6% of the control group versus 19.2% in the HCQ group required mechanical ventilation (p=0.28), and 69.9% of the control group versus 68.9% in the HCQ group converted negative on day 7 (p=0.85). No significant mortality difference between both groups was observed (4.9% versus 6.1%, p=0.47). CONCLUSION This work did not support any benefits of using HCQ in patients with COVID-19, neither in reducing the need for ICU, mechanical ventilation, nor mortality.","Lotfy, Samah Mohamad; Abbas, Ahmad; Shouman, Waheed",Turkish thoracic journal,https://doi.org/10.5152/turkthoracj.2021.20180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33646106/,8
81423,Loss of the Drosophila branched-chain α-keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDH) results in neuronal dysfunction.,2020-07-17,"Objective In this study, we aimed to determine the prevalence of gynecomastia by evaluating computed tomography (CT) images of male patients who were admitted to our hospital during the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Materials and Methods This study included a total of 1,877 patients who underwent chest CT for prediagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia between March 15th and May 15th, 2020. All images were evaluated for the presence of gynecomastia. Gynecomastia patterns were evaluated according to morphological features, and diagnoses were made by measuring the largest glandular tissue diameter. Statistical analysis was performed with IBM SPSS software version 25.0. Results The prevalence of gynecomastia was 32.3%. In terms of pattern, 22% were nodular, 57% were dendritic, and 21% were diffuse glandular gynecomastia. A significant correlation was found between age and gynecomastia pattern (p<0.001). The incidence of nodular, dendritic, and diffuse glandular gynecomastia increased with advancing age. A significant difference was found in the analysis of the correlation between age groups and glandular tissue diameters (p<0.001). With an increase in glandular tissue diameter, the gynecomastia pattern changed from a nodular to a diffuse glandular pattern. Conclusion In our study, gynecomastia diagnosis was made through axial CT images. Although CT should not replace mammography and ultrasonography for clinical diagnosis of gynecomastia, chest CT scans can be used to evaluate patients with suspected gynecomastia.","Aslan, Özge; Bayraktaroğlu, Selen; Çinkooğlu, Akın; Ceylan, Naim; Savaş, Recep; Oktay, Ayşenur",European journal of breast health,https://doi.org/10.4274/ejbh.galenos.2021.6251; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33870118/,8

81438,Radiomics Improves Cancer Screening and Early Detection.,2020-09-11,"BACKGROUND Radical surgical resection is the mainstay of curative treatment for oesophagogastric malignancy. However, survival and recurrence rates remain poor. Theoretical data suggests that the inflammatory response to surgery can promote tumour recurrence. The local and systemic inflammatory response to radical oesophagogastric cancer surgery has not been fully characterized. We aimed to measure this response, particularly factors associated with tumour implantation. METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing radical junctional or gastric cancer resection over 12 months were recruited. Repeated serum and adipose tissue were collected intra-operatively. Adipose tissue was collected adjacent and remote to the tumour, and cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was measured. Post-operatively, daily serum was collected for 7 days, and analysed for inflammatory cell profile and cytokine concentration. RESULTS There were nine patients recruited (67.1 ± 2.1 years). mRNA expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6), CC-chemokine ligand-2 and IL-1β increased in adipose tissue intra-operatively (P < 0.05), equally both adjacent and remote from the tumour site. Serum IL-6 concentration increased from 23.3 pg/mL to 161.8 pg/mL intra-operatively (P < 0.05) before falling steadily to 35.7 pg/mL post-operatively (P < 0.05). Serum tumour necrosis factor-α was elevated throughout, and IL-1β levels were unaffected. Leukocyte and neutrophil populations increased, while T-cell and dendritic cell populations decreased intra-operatively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION Radical surgery dramatically upregulates the expression of pro-tumourigenic cytokines in the peritoneum. There is also a marked systemic immune and inflammatory response to surgery, including downregulation of T-cell and dendritic cell populations. This offers two potential pathways that may facilitate tumour progression - local inflammation promoting peritoneal adherence and implantation, and secondary suppression of immunosurveillance due to circulating inflammatory response.","Long, Andrew J; Burton, Paul R; De Veer, Michael J; Ooi, Geraldine J; Laurie, Cheryl P; Nottle, Peter D; Watt, Matthew J; Brown, Wendy A",ANZ journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.14267; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29194906/,8

81923,Tumoration in Anterior Leaflet of the Mitral Valve.,2021-02-01,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection has been reported safe, feasible and minimally invasive for patients with portal hypertension. We have developed an even less invasive technique, modified laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection, and compared outcomes of modified laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection and open splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection in patients with portal hypertension. METHODS We retrospectively evaluated outcomes in 107 cirrhotic patients with portal hypertensive bleeding and secondary hypersplenism who underwent modified laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection (n = 37) or open splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection (n = 70) between January 2010 and February 2013. Their demographic, intraoperative, and postoperative variables were compared. RESULTS Modified laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection was successful in all patients, with none requiring conversion to open surgery or having significant perioperative complications. Operation time was significantly longer for modified laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection than open splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection (P < 0.0001), but estimated intraoperative blood loss (P = 0.0004); volume of intraoperative blood transfusion (P < 0.05); visual analog scale pain score on the first postoperative day (P < 0.0001); times to first oral intake (P < 0.0001), passage of flatus (P = 0.0004), and off-bed activity (P < 0.0001); postoperative hospital stay (P < 0.0001); postoperative days of temperature >38.0 °C (P = 0.002); white blood cell counts on postoperative days 1 (P < 0.0001) and 7 (P < 0.05) were significantly reduced in the modified laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection group. The percentage of patients experiencing postoperative complications was significantly lower in the modified laparoscopic splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection group than in the open splenectomy and azygoportal disconnection group (13.5 % [5/37] vs. 35.7 % [25/70], P < 0.05).

82296,Pediatric NAFLD: lessons from the gut.,2020-08-01,"After the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, many international airport quarantine stations conducted fever-based screening to identify infected passengers using infrared thermography for preventing global pandemics. Due to environmental factors affecting measurement of facial skin temperature with thermography, some previous studies revealed the limits of authenticity in detecting infectious symptoms. In order to implement more strict entry screening in the epidemic seasons of emerging infectious diseases, we developed an infection screening system for airport quarantines using multi-parameter vital signs. This system can automatically detect infected individuals within several tens of seconds by a neural-network-based discriminant function using measured vital signs, i.e., heart rate obtained by a reflective photo sensor, respiration rate determined by a 10-GHz non-contact respiration radar, and the ear temperature monitored by a thermography. In this paper, to reduce the environmental effects on thermography measurement, we adopted the ear temperature as a new screening indicator instead of facial skin. We tested the system on 13 influenza patients and 33 normal subjects. The sensitivity of the infection screening system in detecting influenza were 92.3%, which was higher than the sensitivity reported in our previous paper (88.0%) with average facial skin temperature.","Sun, Guanghao; Abe, Nobujiro; Sugiyama, Youhei; Nguyen, Quang Vinh; Nozaki, Kohei; Nakayama, Yosuke; Takei, Osamu; Hakozaki, Yukiya; Abe, Shigeto; Matsui, Takemi",Conference proceedings : ...

82706,Efficacy and safety of a novel multi-electrode radiofrequency ablation catheter for renal sympathetic denervation in pigs.,2015,"Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris) is an economically important leaf vegetable crop worldwide. Mounting studies have shown that cysteine-cysteine-cysteine-histidine (CCCH) zinc-finger protein genes are involved in various plant growth and development processes. However, research on the involvement of these genes in male reproductive development is still in its infancy. Here, we identified 11 male fertility-related CCCH genes in Chinese cabbage. Among them, a pair of paralogs encoding novel non-tandem CCCH zinc-finger proteins, Brassica campestris Male Fertility 30a (BcMF30a) and BcMF30c, were further characterized. They were highly expressed in pollen during microgametogenesis and continued to express in germinated pollen. Further analyses demonstrated that both BcMF30a and BcMF30c may play a dual role as transcription factors and RNA-binding proteins in plant cells. Functional analysis showed that partial bcmf30a bcmf30c pollen grains were aborted due to the degradation of pollen inclusion at the microgametogenesis phase, and the germination rate of viable pollen was also greatly reduced, indicating that BcMF30a and BcMF30c are required for both pollen development and pollen germination. This research provided insights into the function of CCCH proteins in regulating male reproductive development and laid a theoretical basis for hybrid breeding of Chinese cabbage.","Xu, Liai; Xiong, Xingpeng; Liu, Weimiao; Liu, Tingting; Yu, Youjian; Cao, Jiashu",International journal of molecular sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms21176428; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32899329/,8
82772,Percutaneous drainage of intra-abdominal abscess in children with perforated appendicitis.,2012,"In severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), viral pneumonia progresses to respiratory failure. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are extracellular webs of chromatin, microbicidal proteins, and oxidant enzymes that are released by neutrophils to contain infections. However, when not properly regulated, NETs have potential to propagate inflammation and microvascular thrombosis - including in the lungs of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. While elevated levels of blood neutrophils predict worse outcomes in COVID-19, the role of NETs has not been investigated. We now report that sera from patients with COVID-19 (n = 50 patients, n = 84 samples) have elevated levels of cell-free DNA, myeloperoxidase(MPO)-DNA, and citrullinated histone H3 (Cit-H3); the latter two are highly specific markers of NETs. Highlighting the potential clinical relevance of these findings, cell-free DNA strongly correlated with acute phase reactants including C-reactive protein, D-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as absolute neutrophil count. MPO-DNA associated with both cell-free DNA and absolute neutrophil count, while Cit-H3 correlated with platelet levels. Importantly, both cell-free DNA and MPO-DNA were higher in hospitalized patients receiving mechanical ventilation as compared with hospitalized patients breathing room air. Finally, sera from individuals with COVID-19 triggered NET release from control neutrophils in vitro. In summary, these data reveal high levels of NETs in many patients with COVID-19, where they may contribute to cytokine release and respiratory failure. Future studies should investigate the predictive power of circulating NETs in longitudinal cohorts, and determine the extent to which NETs may be novel therapeutic targets in severe COVID-19.","Zuo, Yu; Yalavarthi, Srilakshmi; Shi, Hui; Gockman, Kelsey; Zuo, Melanie; Madison, Jacqueline A; Blair, Christopher N; Weber, Andrew; Barnes, Betsy J; Egeblad, Mikala; Woods, Robert J; Kanthi, Yogendra; Knight, Jason S",JCI insight,https://doi.org/10.1172/jci.insight.138999; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32329756/,8

Whether this relationship is interrelated with institution volume of CDT is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database was used to identify all patients admitted with a principal diagnosis of proximal or inferior vena caval deep vein thrombosis and treated with CDT from 2005 to 2010. Institutions were divided into high-volume (≥6 procedures a year) and low-volume (<6 procedures a year) centers. Propensity score matching was used to create 2 matched groups for comparative analysis. A total of 90 618 patients were hospitalized for proximal lower-extremity deep vein thrombosis, and 3649 patients (4.1%) underwent CDT. In-hospital mortality was significantly lower at high-volume centers (0.6% versus 1.5%; P=0.04) with a trend toward lower intracranial hemorrhage rates compared with low-volume centers (0.4% versus 1%; P=0.07). No significant difference was seen with blood transfusion (10.4% versus 10.8%; P=0.70), gastrointestinal bleeding (1.4% versus 1.8%; P=0.35), or pulmonary embolism rates (18.4% versus 17.9%; P=0.72). Median length of stay was similar (6 days) and hospital charges were higher ($65 500 versus $75 870) at high-volume centers. CONCLUSIONS In this observational study, we found that an increase in institutional volume of CDT was associated with lower in-hospital mortality and lower intracranial hemorrhage rates. Further studies are needed to assess whether standardization of CDT protocols across all institutions in the United States improves outcomes.","Jarrett, Harish; Zack, Chad J; Aggarwal, Vikas; Lakhter, Vladimir; Alkhouli, Mohammad A; Zhao, Huaqing; Comerota, Anthony; Bove, Alfred A; Bashir, Riyaz",Circulation,https://doi.org/10.1161/circulationaha.115.015555; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26199337/,8

Significant enrichment of a minor IFITM3 allele was recently reported for patients who were hospitalized for seasonal and 2009 H1N1 pandemic flu. This IFITM3 allele lacks the region corresponding to the first amino-terminal 21 amino acids and is unable to inhibit influenza A virus. In this study, we found that deleting this 21-amino-acid region relocates IFITM3 from the endosomal compartments to the cell periphery. This finding likely underlies the lost inhibition of influenza A virus that completes its entry exclusively within endosomes at low pH. Yet, wild-type IFITM3 and the mutant with the 21-amino-acid deletion inhibit HIV-1 replication equally well. Given the pH-independent nature of HIV-1 entry, our results suggest that IFITM3 can inhibit viruses that enter cells via different routes and that its N-terminal region is specifically required for controlling pH-dependent viruses.","Jia, Rui; Pan, Qinghua; Ding, Shilei; Rong, Liwei; Liu, Shan-Lu; Geng, Yunqi; Qiao, Wentao; Liang, Chen",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01828-12; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23055554/,8

Autoregulation indices derived from near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) may clarify hemodynamic goals that conform to the limits of autoregulation. OBJECTIVES The aims of this pilot study were to determine whether the NIRS-derived indices could identify blood pressure ranges that optimize autoregulation and whether autoregulatory function differs between anatomic sides in patients with unilateral vasculopathy. METHODS Pediatric patients undergoing indirect surgical revascularization for moyamoya were enrolled sequentially. NIRS-derived autoregulation indices, the cerebral oximetry index (COx) and the hemoglobin volume index (HVx), were calculated intraoperatively and postoperatively to measure autoregulatory function. The 5-mmHg ranges of optimal mean arterial blood pressure (MAPOPT ) with best autoregulation and the lower limit of autoregulation (LLA) were identified. RESULTS Of seven enrolled patients (aged 2-16 years), six had intraoperative and postoperative autoregulation monitoring and one had only intraoperative monitoring. Intraoperative MAPOPT was identified in six (86%) of seven patients with median values of 60-80 mmHg. Intraoperative LLA was identified in three (43%) patients with median values of 55-65 mmHg. Postoperative MAPOPT was identified in six (100%) of six patients with median values of 70-90 mmHg. Patients with unilateral disease had higher intraoperative HVx (P = 0.012) on side vasculopathy.

Methods A longitudinal follow-up investigation of 25 patients from a tertiary hospital in Henan provincial was conducted 8 weeks after discharge. Of these patients, 15 attended a second follow-up appointment 8 weeks after that. A throat swab reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis for SARS-CoV-2 and chest computerized tomography (CT) scans were implemented at the first follow-up appointment, and a total of 40 blood samples (25 from the first and 15 from the second follow-up appointment) were collected. Patients' levels of Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody against S-Receptor binding domain (S-RBD) and Nucleocapsid Protein (NP) of SARS-CoV-2 and the subpopulation of lymphocytes were evaluated using an enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) test and flow cytometry, respectively. Results At the first follow-up appointment, 10 of the 25 patients (40.0%) showed complete radiological resolution. Of these patients, 80.0% were classified as moderate, and 80.0% were younger (those whose age was ≤ the median age of all the patients). The predominant patterns of abnormalities included an irregular line (12/25, 48.0%), ground-glass opacity (GGO) (44.0%), and multiple GGOs (28.0%). At the first follow-up appointment, 40.0% (10/25) of patients still had lymphopenia. Of the 15 patients who were followed-up with twice, the ratio of lymphopenia was 80% (12/15), 60.0% (9/15), and 46.7% (7/15) at 0, 8, and 16 weeks after discharge, respectively. This was mainly due to a decrease in the cluster of differentiation (CD) 4+ T lymphocyte, which was observed in 60% (9/15), 60% (9/15), and 46.7% (7/15) of total patients at 0, 8, and 16 weeks after discharge, respectively. All of the patients were S-RBD and NP IgG antibody positive at the first follow-up appointment. 40.0% (6/15) and 66.7% (10/15) of patients showed a decrease over 50.0% in the level of NP and S-RBD IgG antibodies, respectively, at the second follow-up appointment. The NP and S-RBD IgG antibodies' levels declined to 44.6% (P=0.044) and 28.1% (P=0.18), respectively. 0 and 26.7% (4/15) of patients turned from NP and S-RBD IgG antibody positive to negative, respectively. Conclusions About half of the patients still showed at least 1 abnormality in chest CT scans 8 weeks after discharge and lymphopenia 16 weeks after discharge. The level of the IgG antibody had declined by the follow-up appointment. Notably, the S-RBD IgG antibody declined more dramatically than that of NP. These results may have implications in the making of policies related to disease prevention, the long-term management of discharged patients, and vaccines' development.","Wang, Ziqi; Yang, Li; Chen, Yi; Xu, Zhiwei; Wang, Hui; Zhang, Xiaoju",Journal of thoracic disease,https://doi.org/10.21037/jtd-20-3011; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34164190/,8

85979,Racial Disproportionality in Covid Clinical Trials.,2020-11-06,"BACKGROUND Restricted access to hospitals due to the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has significantly altered practice patterns for elective neurosurgical care. Particularly, telemedicine has become the primary modality of patient visits for nonemergent conditions. This study aimed to characterize user experiences of neurosurgeons and advanced practice providers focusing on perceived utility and barriers of telemedicine in management of elective neurosurgical patients during COVID-19. METHODS An online survey was sent to clinicians involved in neurosurgical care using telemedicine with questions focusing on frequency of utilization, duration of patient encounters, benefits of telemedicine, and barriers to current forms of remote patient visits. Survey responses were stratified by clinical position (neurosurgeon vs. advanced practice provider) and subspecialty focus (cranial vs. spinal neurosurgery). RESULTS The survey was completed by 14 of 17 eligible clinicians. Respondents included 10 neurosurgeons and 4 APPs with 57% specializing in cranial neurosurgery and 43% specializing in spinal neurosurgery. During the COVID-19 period, 78% of respondents used teleconference/video conference visits multiple times in a week, and 86% planned to continue using telemedicine after the pandemic. The most common barrier for telemedicine was the inability to perform a neurological examination, while the most common perceived benefit was increased convenience for patients. CONCLUSIONS During the COVID-19 period, telemedicine was heavily relied on to ensure the continuation of perioperative care for patients with elective neurosurgical pathologies. While clinicians identified numerous barriers for current telemedicine platforms, the use of telemedicine will likely continue, as it has provided unique benefits for patients, clinicians, and hospitals.","Ryu, Won Hyung A; Kerolus, Mena G; Traynelis, Vincent C",World neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wneu.2020.10.101; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33203534/,8
86007,MD2 contributes to the pathogenesis of perioperative neurocognitive disorder via the regulation of α5GABAA receptors in aged mice.,2021-09-16,"Objective Thoracoscopic treatment of pulmonary hydatid cyst (PHC) has been considered to be a good treatment option in both children and adults for nearly 25 years. However, there have been very few pediatric studies published during this period. Our goal is to review our results and evaluate the efficiency of thorascopy in pediatric patients. Materials and Methods The medical records of patients with PHC who were surgically treated between 2005 and 2015 were reviewed. As all cysts larger than 5 cm in diameter were surgically removed, cysts less than 5 cm in diameter were medically treated and were not included in the study. Demographics, cyst characteristics, and operative/postoperative data were compared between patients who underwent thorascopy (thoracoscopy group) and patients who underwent thoracotomy (thoracotomy group). Chi-square and t-test were used for statistical analysis where appropriate. Results There were 26 consecutive children (14 girls, 12 boys; mean age 9.4±2.7) included in the study. Except for 2 incidentally diagnosed patients, all were symptomatic, 4 had multifocal lesions, and multiorgan involvement was detected in 11 patients. Thoracoscopy was performed in 10 patients, and conversion was necessary in 2 patients due to unsuccessful fistula ligation attempts. The thoracoscopy group included 8 thoracoscopically treated patients, and remaining patients constituted the thoracotomy group (n=18). Comparison of preoperative characteristics of the groups was insignificant, whereas the overall complication rate (residual bronchial fistula, prolonged air leak, pneumothorax, and localized air cyst) and median hospital stay were significantly higher in the thoracoscopy group. There was no mortality and no recurrence at the postoperative follow-up after 37.4 months. Conclusion The thoracoscopic approach to PHC may have a high risk of conversion and postoperative complication rate. Thoracotomy in children still seems to be the approach of choice for PHC larger than 5 cm. Routine thoracoscopic hydatid cyst treatment is yet far from being the gold standard, whereas thoracoscopy may be preferred in selected patients.","Dokumcu, Zafer; Arslan, Serkan; Divarci, Emre; Erdener, Ata; Ozcan, Coskun",The Eurasian journal of medicine,https://doi.org/10.5152/eurasianjmed.2017.17080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29123439/,8

86432,"Occult drug resistance in tuberculosis: Emerging issues, upcoming challenges & possible solutions.",2020-06-01,"PURPOSE To describe the safety and feasibility of a running continuous unidirectional barbed suture (V-Loc, Covidien, Mansfield, MA) for primary common bile duct closure while performing laparoscopic common bile duct exploration (LCBDE). INTRODUCTION LCBDE is nowadays the best approach for treating complex common bile duct lithiasis or cases where the endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography has failed. It is clear that the primary closure of the common bile duct must be preferred over the T-tube drainage. The actual technical aspects offer room for improvement. We present our experience with barbed suture, for which recently, various fields of surgery have become interested in and which now has a series of studies that support it for several uses. METHODS Between July 2012 and July 2014, 54 consecutive patients with bile duct stones underwent LCBDE by a single surgeon. Perioperative outcomes and 30-day complications were recorded. RESULTS Upon the completion of the exploration, 50 patients had primary common bile duct closure using knotless unidirectional barbed 3-0 V-Loc 90 suture, and 4 patients were excluded. All of the sutures were performed without knot tying. The procedure in all patients was successfully performed with no intraoperative complications. There were no bile leaks in the 50 patients or other postoperative complications such as infection, need for reintervention or death. CONCLUSION The use of unidirectional knotless barbed suture (V-Loc 90) is safe, feasible and effective on LCBDE for primary common bile duct closure. The biliary leak rate is acceptably low and comparable to the rate reported in the literature. This report is our initial experience that needs further clinical trials.","Fernandez, Luis C; Toriz, Augusto; Hernandez, Jorge; Sanchez, Norberto; Linares, Erick; Zenteno, Massiel; Cuendis, Adolfo; Olivares, Jose; Guerrero, Gustavo; Cervantes, Cesar F",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-015-4620-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26541731/,8
86555,Breathomics for the clinician: the use of volatile organic compounds in respiratory diseases.,2021-01-07,"INTRODUCTION Patients with pre-existing respiratory diseases in the setting of COVID-19 may have a greater risk of severe complications and even death. METHODS A retrospective, multicenter, cohort study with 5847 COVID-19 patients admitted to hospitals. Patients were separated in two groups, with/without previous lung disease. Evaluation of factors associated with survival and secondary composite end-point such as ICU admission and respiratory support, were explored. RESULTS 1,271 patients (22%) had a previous lung disease, mostly COPD. All-cause mortality occurred in 376 patients with lung disease (29.5%) and in 819 patients without (17.9%) (p<0.001). Kaplan-Meier curves showed that patients with lung diseases had a worse 30-day survival (HR=1.78; 95%C.I. 1.58-2.01; p<0.001) and COPD had almost 40% mortality. Multivariable Cox regression showed that prior lung disease remained a risk factor for mortality (HR, 1.21; 95%C.I. 1.02-1.44; p=0.02). Variables independently associated with all-cause mortality risk in patients with lung diseases were oxygen saturation less than 92% on admission (HR, 4.35; 95% CI 3.08-6.15) and elevated D-dimer (HR, 1.84; 95% CI 1.27-2.67). Age younger than 60 years (HR 0.37; 95% CI 0.21-0.65) was associated with decreased risk of death. CONCLUSIONS Previous lung disease is a risk factor for mortality in patients with COVID-19. Older age, male gender, home oxygen therapy, and respiratory failure on admission were associated with an increased mortality. Efforts must be done to identify respiratory patients to set measures to improve their clinical outcomes.","Signes-Costa, Jaime; Núñez-Gil, Iván J; Soriano, Joan B; Arroyo-Espliguero, Ramón; Eid, Charbel Maroun; Romero, Rodolfo; Uribarri, Aitor; Fernández-Rozas, Inmaculada; Aguado, Marcos García; Becerra-Muñoz, Víctor Manuel; Huang, Jia; Pepe, Martino; Cerrato, Enrico; Raposeiras, Sergio; Gonzalez, Adelina; Franco-Leon, Francisco; Wang, Lin; Alfonso, Emilio; Ugo, Fabrizio; García-Prieto, Juan Fortunato; Feltes, Gisela; Abumayyaleh, Mohammad; Espejo-Paeres, Carolina; Jativa, Jorge; Masjuan, Alvaro López; Macaya, Carlos; Carbonell Asíns, Juan A; Estrada, Vicente",Archivos de bronconeumologia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arbres.2020.11.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423874/,8
86901,Characterisation of the Expression of Neurotensin and Its Receptors in Human Colorectal Cancer and Its Clinical Implications.,2020-08-05,"AIM Evaluation of the usefulness and the parental opinion about teleconsultation (TC) for rare pediatric epilepsies. METHOD One-month prospective survey of consecutive TCs. All clinics on site have been turned into TC in the context of COVID-19 pandemic. The physicians quoted all TCs while the parents expressed their opinion though an invitation for an online questionnaire. RESULTS We included 151 TCs (145 patients) among the 259 epilepsy TCs done during the study period. The parental questionnaire has been answered 105 times. The physicians felt confident to organize a TC for the next visit of 74.8% of the children, but some limits were identified such as the absence of physical examination, weight, and psychomotor development evaluation. The physicians felt more confident for a new TC in older patients (9.5 ± 5.5 years versus 5.3 ± 4.3 years) and in stable patients (73.8% confident for instable, 82.8% for stable). Parents were satisfied with TC feeling that it answered health issues in a better manner than a clinic pinpointing the gain of time and the absence of travel. However, half of them would prefer a clinic for the next appointment. INTERPRETATION Teleconsultation seems useful answering the patients' needs according to both physicians and families. Despite some limitations, it is most likely that TCs become a new part of the clinical activities in rare pediatric epilepsy centers.","Dozières-Puyravel, Blandine; Auvin, Stéphane",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2020.107656; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33317938/,8
87713,In vivo comparison of two navigation systems for abdominal percutaneous needle intervention.,2017,"Social media posts can be used to explore public perceptions of interprofessional teams and healthcare professionals. The aim of this study was to use social listening technique to explore unfiltered public perceptions of the professionals involved in healthcare teams during the COVID-19 pandemic, in a naturalistic online setting, and to elaborate on the emotional reactions in response to an online social media post. A cross-sectional retrospective review of comments on a specific social media post was conducted between 15 March and 28 April 2020 using summative content analysis. One image that was widely circulated on social media platforms with two questions: 'Who society thinks works at hospital? versus who really works at hospitals?' was selected. Three platforms were searched, Facebook®, Twitter®, and LinkedIn®. Only publicly available posts were included. Out of the initial 40 posts identified, 21 posts which had 1759 comments were analysed and 1576 were included for coding. Of the emerging nine themes, perceptions of who is in the team was the largest (40.5%, n = 639), followed by agreement (23.1%, n = 364) and feeling excluded (16.2%, n = 255). Of emotional expressions, 42.1% were positive and 57.9% negative. The most frequent emotions were frustration (54.4%, n = 857) followed by gratitude (16.3%, n = 257) and relief (15.9%, n = 250). The post brought considerable attention to the role of the interprofessional team and generated many feelings of frustration and exclusion. For this reason, the response to this social media post is very important and not to be overlooked. Healthcare professionals need to work together to strengthen their presence as an interprofessional team, united to deliver safe effective quality care for patients. The current COVID-19 pandemic and the media attention should be taken as an opportunity by the interprofessional community to work together to combat negative media stereotypes. Further research is warranted on public perceptions of the healthcare team.","El-Awaisi, Alla; O'Carroll, Veronica; Koraysh, Somaya; Koummich, Sarra; Huber, Marion",Journal of interprofessional care,https://doi.org/10.1080/13561820.2020.1819779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962452/,8
87814,Call for More Effective Regulation of Clinical Trials with Advanced Therapy Medicinal Products Consisting of or Containing Genetically Modified Organisms in the European Union.,2021-04-11,"BACKGROUND One of the biggest concerns associated with transgastric surgery is contamination and risk of intra-abdominal infection with microbes introduced from the access route. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of oral decontamination with chlorhexidine on microbial contamination of the endoscope. METHODS In a prospective, randomized, single-blinded, clinical trial the effect of chlorhexidine mouth rinse was evaluated. As a surrogate for the risk of intra-abdominal contamination during transgastric surgery, microbial contamination of the endoscope during upper endoscopy was examined. Patients referred to upper endoscopy were assessed for eligibility and randomized to either chlorhexidine or no mouth rinse. Culture samples were collected from gastric aspirates and endoscopes. The primary outcome measure was colony forming units (CFU) in the endoscope samples. Secondary outcome measures were species specific effect of chlorhexidine on micro-organisms with abscess forming capabilities and the effect of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment on CFU. RESULTS Chlorhexidine mouth rinse resulted in a significant reduction of CFU in the endoscope samples (p = 0.001). There was no species specific effect and micro-organisms with abscess forming capabilities were equally present. PPI treatment was associated with significantly higher CFU counts in both the gastric (p = 0.004) and endoscope samples (p = 0.049). CONCLUSIONS Chlorhexidine mouth rinse was effective in reducing microbial contamination of the endoscope, but micro-organisms with abscess forming capabilities were still present. PPI treatment significantly increased CFU and should be discontinued before transgastric surgery.","Donatsky, Anders Meller; Holzknecht, Barbara Juliane; Arpi, Magnus; Vilmann, Peter; Meisner, Søren; Jørgensen, Lars N; Rosenberg, Jacob",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-012-2686-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23292558/,8
87891,"Advances in cataract surgery planning, methods, and outcomes in the pandemic era.",2020-11-05,"BACKGROUND The safety and efficacy of flow-diversion treatment of MCA aneurysms have not been well-established. PURPOSE Our aim was to evaluate angiographic and clinical outcomes after flow diversions for MCA aneurysms. DATA SOURCES A systematic search of PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase was performed for studies published from 2008 to May 2017. STUDY SELECTION According to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we selected studies with >5 patients describing angiographic and clinical outcomes after flow-diversion treatment of MCA aneurysms. DATA ANALYSIS Random-effects meta-analysis was used to pool the following outcomes: aneurysm occlusion rate, procedure-related complications, rupture rate of treated aneurysms, and occlusion of the jailed branches. DATA SYNTHESIS Twelve studies evaluating 244 MCA aneurysms were included in this meta-analysis. Complete/near-complete occlusion was obtained in 78.7% (95% CI, 67.8%-89.7%) of aneurysms. The rupture rate of treated aneurysms during follow-up was 0.4% per aneurysm-year. The rate of treatment-related complications was 20.7% (95% CI, 14%-27.5%), and approximately 10% of complications were permanent. The mortality rate was close to 2%. Nearly 10% (95% CI, 4.7%-15.5%) of jailed arteries were occluded during follow-up, whereas 26% (95% CI, 14.4%-37.6%) had slow flow. Rates of symptoms related to occlusion and slow flow were close to 5%. LIMITATIONS Small and retrospective series could affect the strength of the reported results. CONCLUSIONS Given the not negligible rate of treatment-related complications, flow diversion for MCA aneurysms should be considered an alternative treatment when traditional treatment methods are not feasible. However, when performed in this select treatment group, high rates of aneurysm occlusion and protection against re-rupture can be achieved.","Cagnazzo, F; Mantilla, D; Lefevre, P-H; Dargazanli, C; Gascou, G; Costalat, V",AJNR.

87963,Standard versus hypofractionated intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer: assessing the impact on dose modulation and normal tissue effects when using patient-specific cancer biology.,2020-05-14,"OBJECTIVES Closed minimal extracorporeal circulation (MECC) systems currently do not represent the standard of surgical care for open-heart surgery. Yet, considering the beneficial results reported for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, we used an MECC system in aortic valve replacement (AVR) and analysed the effects on intraoperative microvascular perfusion in comparison with conventional open extracorporeal circulation (CECC). METHODS In the current study, we analysed alterations in microvascular perfusion at 4 predefined time points (T1-T4) during surgical AVR utilizing orthogonal polarization spectral (OPS) imaging. Twenty patients were randomized for being operated on utilizing either MECC or CECC. Changes in functional capillary density (FCD, cm/cm(2)), mircovascular blood flow velocity (mm/s) and vessel diameter (μm) were analysed by a blinded investigator. RESULTS After the start of extracorporeal circulation and aortic cross-clamping (T2), both groups showed a significant drop in FCD, but with a significantly higher FCD in the MECC group (153.1 ± 15.0 cm/cm² in the CECC group vs 160.8 ± 12.2 cm/cm² in the MECC group, P = 0.034). During the late phase of the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) (T3), the FCD was still significantly depressed in both treatment groups (153.5 ± 14.6 cm/cm² in the CECC group, P <0.05 vs 'T1'; 159.5 ± 12.4 cm/cm² in the MECC group, P <0.05 versus 'T1'). After termination of CPB (T4), the FCD recovered in both groups to baseline values. Microvascular blood flow velocity tended to remain at a higher level in the MECC group, whereas haemodilution during CPB was significantly reduced in the MECC group. CONCLUSIONS The use of MECC in AVR did not affect procedural safety and, resulted in beneficial preservation of microvascular blood flow velocity and significantly reduced haemodilution during CPB. In contrast to CABG surgery, the use of MECC did not improve FCD during surgical AVR. Clinical advantages possibly resulting from attenuated haemodilution and preservation of microvascular blood flow velocity require further validation in larger patient cohorts.","Donndorf, Peter; Park, Hannah; Vollmar, Brigitte; Alms, Angela; Gierer, Philipp; Steinhoff, Gustav; Kaminski, Alexander",Interactive cardiovascular and thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1093/icvts/ivu131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24796334/,8

High-risk AGPs are identified by duration, proximity, manipulation of high-viral load tissue, and use of powered instrumentation. Appropriate personal protective equipment includes selection of respiratory and eye protection. COVID-19 testing can screen for asymptomatic carriers prior to high-risk procedures; however, alternative testing methods are required in rhinologic patients not eligible for nasopharyngeal testing due to nasal obstruction or skull base defects.

We evaluated the feasibility and clinical utility of a novel MR imaging technique for regional perfusion imaging in this patient group. MATERIALS AND METHODS Superselective pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling with a circular labeling spot enabling selective vessel labeling was added to routine imaging in a prospective pilot study in 50 patients (10 women, 70.05 ± 10.55 years of age) with extracranial steno-occlusive disease. Thirty-three had infarct lesions. DSC-MR imaging was performed in 16/50 (32%), and cerebral DSA, in 12/50 patients (24%). Vascular anatomy and the distribution of vessel stenoses and occlusions were defined on sonography and TOF-MRA. Stenoses were classified according to the NASCET criteria. Infarct lesions and perfusion deficits were defined on FLAIR and DSC-MR imaging, respectively. Individual perfusion patterns were defined on the superselective pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling maps and were correlated with vascular anatomy and infarct lesion localization. RESULTS The superselective pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling imaging sequence could be readily applied by trained technicians, and the additional scan time of 12.7 minutes was well-tolerated by patients. The detected vessel occlusions/stenoses and perfusion patterns corresponded between cerebral DSA and superselective pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling maps in all cases. Perfusion deficits on DSC-CBF maps significantly correlated with those on superselective pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling maps (Pearson r = 0.9593, P < .01). Individual collateral recruitment patterns were not predictable from the vascular anatomy in 71% of our patients. CONCLUSIONS Superselective pseudocontinuous arterial spin-labeling is a robust technique for regional brain perfusion imaging, suitable for the noninvasive diagnostics of individual perfusion patterns in patients with complex cerebrovascular disease.","Richter, V; Helle, M; van Osch, M J P; Lindner, T; Gersing, A S; Tsantilas, P; Eckstein, H-H; Preibisch, C; Zimmer, C",AJNR.

We examined ipRGC-driven pupil responses in civilian TBI and control participants using two pupillography protocols that assessed transient and adaptive properties: (1) a one second (s) long wavelength ""red"" stimulus (651 nm, 133 cd/m2) and 10 increasing intensities of 1 s short wavelength ""blue"" stimuli (456 nm, 0.167 to 167 cd/m2) with a 60 s interstimulus interval, and (2) two minutes of 0.1 Hz red stimuli (33 cd/m2), followed by two minutes of 0.1 Hz blue stimuli (16 cd/m2). For Protocol 1, constriction amplitude and the 6 s post illumination pupil response (PIPR) were calculated. For Protocol 2, amplitudes and peak velocities of pupil constriction and redilation were calculated. For Protocol 1, constriction amplitude and the 6 s PIPR were not significantly different between TBI patients and control subjects for red or blue stimuli. For Protocol 2, pupil constriction amplitude attenuated over time for red stimuli and potentiated over time for blue stimuli across all subjects. Constriction and redilation velocities were similar between groups. Pupil constriction amplitude was significantly less in TBI patients compared to control subjects for red and blue stimuli, which can be attributed to age-related differences in baseline pupil size. While TBI, in addition to age, may have contributed to decreased baseline pupil diameter and constriction amplitude, responses to blue stimulation suggest no selective damage to ipRGCs.","Mostafa, Jakaria; Porter, Jason; Queener, Hope M; Ostrin, Lisa A",Vision research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2021.07.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34352476/,8
89730,Mood disorders and non-celiac gluten sensitivity.,2017,"The CoViD-19 pandemic has shattered the illusion that healthcare resource shortages that require rationing are problems restricted to low- and middle-income countries. During the pandemic surges, many high-income countries have been confronted with unprecedented demands for healthcare that dramatically exceeded available resources. Hospitals capacities were overwhelmed, and physicians working in intensive care units (ICUs) were often forced to deny admissions to patients in desperate need of intensive care. To support these difficult decisions, many scientific societies and governmental bodies have developed guidelines on the triage of patients in need of mechanical ventilation and other lifesupport treatments. The ethical approaches underlying these recommendations were grounded on egalitarian or utilitarian principles. Thus far, however, consensus on the approaches used, and, above all, on the solutions adopted have been limited, giving rise to a clash of opinions that has further complicated health professionals' ability to respond optimally to their patients' needs. As the CoViD-19 crisis moves toward a phase of what some have called ""pandemic normalcy"", the need to debate the merits and demerits of the individual decisions made in the allocation of ICU resources seems less pressing. Instead, the aims of the authors are: 1) to critically review the approaches and criteria used for triaging patients to be admitted in ICU; 2) to clarify how macroand micro-allocation choices, in their interdependance, can condition decision-making processes regarding the care of individual patients; and 3) to reflect on the need for decision-makers and professionals working in ICUs to maintain a proper degree of ""honesty"" towards citizens and patients regarding the causes of the resource shortages and the decision-making processes, which, in different ways routinely and in crisis times, involve the need to make ""tragic choices"" at both levels.","Gristina, Giuseppe R; Piccinni, Mariassunta",Minerva anestesiologica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0375-9393.21.15736-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34633169/,8

The authors examined the effects of high-grade carotid stenosis on the results of endovascular treatment of patients in the Interventional Management of Stroke (IMS)-III trial. METHODS The 278 patients in the endovascular arm of the IMS-III trial were categorized according to the degree of carotid stenosis as determined by angiography. In comparing patients with severe stenosis or occlusion (≥ 70%) to those without severe stenosis (< 70%), the authors evaluated the time to endovascular reperfusion, modified Thrombolysis in Cerebrovascular Infarction (mTICI) scores, 24-hour mean infarct volumes, symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage rates, and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores at 90 days. RESULTS Compared with the 249 patients with less than 70% stenosis, patients with severe stenosis (n = 29) were found to have a significantly longer mean time to reperfusion (105.7 vs 77.7 minutes, p = 0.004); differences in mTICI scores, infarct volumes, hemorrhage rates, and mRS scores at 90 days did not reach statistical significance. Multiple regression analysis revealed that severe carotid stenosis (p < 0.0001) and higher baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores (p = 0.004) were associated with an increase in time to reperfusion. Older age (p < 0.0001), higher NIHSS score (p < 0.0001), and the absence of reperfusion (p = 0.001) were associated with worse clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Severe ipsilateral ICA stenosis was associated with a significantly longer time to reperfusion in the IMS-III trial. Although these findings may not translate directly to modern devices, this 28-minute delay in reperfusion has significant implications, raising concern over the treatment of tandem ICA stenosis and downstream large-vessel occlusion.","Gogela, Steven L; Gozal, Yair M; Zhang, Bin; Tomsick, Thomas A; Ringer, Andrew J; Broderick, Joseph P; Khatri, Pooja; Abruzzo, Todd A",Journal of neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.3171/2016.9.jns161044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28156253/,8

This systematic review examined the effect of motor and physical activity intervention on motor outcomes of children with autism spectrum disorder and the effect of motor learning strategies on motor skill acquisition, retention, and transfer. Six databases were searched from 2000 to 2019. Forty-one studies were included: 34 intervention studies and 7 motor learning studies. The overall quality of the evidence was low. Participants included 1173 children with autism spectrum disorder ranging from 3 to 19 years. Results from level II and III intervention studies supported that participation outcomes improved with a physical education intervention; activity outcomes improved with aquatic, motor activity, motor skill, and simulated horse riding interventions; and body structure and function outcomes improved with aquatic, exergaming, motor activity, motor skill, and simulated horse riding interventions. Results from level II and III motor learning studies supported that motor skill acquisition improved with visual, versus verbal, instructions but was not influenced by differences in instructional personnel. More rigorous research on motor intervention is needed with well-controlled study designs, adequate sample sizes, and manualized protocols. In addition, research on motor learning strategies is warranted as it generalizes across motor interventions.","Ruggeri, Anneliese; Dancel, Alina; Johnson, Robert; Sargent, Barbara",Autism : the international journal of research and practice,https://doi.org/10.1177/1362361319885215; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31782658/,8

DATA The PICO strategy was used to include randomized clinical trials in human subjects with DH (P) after NSPT treated with DA (I) compared to those treated with placebo or control (C) to identify DH relief (O). The Cochrane guidelines and GRADE was used to classify the risk of bias and the quality of the evidence, respectively. SOURCES PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Lilacs, Cochrane Library databases, and OpenGrey were searched on the 20th of May 2020. STUDY SELECTION Nine studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. Five meta-analyses were performed. Three meta-analyzes assessed the effectiveness of DA compared to a placebo or control in relation to pain assessment stimuli and two meta-analyzes assessed the mechanism of action of DA. For the mechanical stimulus in overall analysis, the control group presented a higher mean of pain reduction (SMD 1.03 [0.73, 1.32], p < 0.001) with very low certainty of evidence. For water (SMD -0.78 [-1.22, -0.35], p = 0.0009) and evaporative in overall analysis (SMD -1.21 [-1.79, -0.64], p < 0.001) stimuli, the DA decreased DH pain with very low and low certainty of evidence, respectively. CONCLUSION Due to the limited quality of evidence, there is no definitive conclusion on the effectiveness of DA on DH after NSPT. Thus, further clinical studies with a low risk of bias and high-quality evidence are encouraged to reinforce the certainty of evidence on that issue. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The use of desensitizing agents can be promising to relieve dentin hypersensitivity after non-surgical periodontal therapy. Therefore, it could be applied routinely after this periodontal treatment.","de Oliveira, Roberta Pimentel; Alencar, Cristiane de Melo; Silva, Fábio Alves; Magno, Marcela Baraúna; Maia, Lucianne Cople; Silva, Cecy Martins",Journal of dentistry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdent.2020.103498; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069772/,8

Methods Ninety-six patients who underwent unilateral endovenous thermal ablation of great saphenous vein were included. ClosureFast™ catheters were used in the RFA group and 1470 nm radial fiber laser catheters were used in the EVLA group. Results The RFA group consisted of 41 patients and the EVLA group consisted of 55 patients. The preoperative baseline characteristics of both groups were similar. On the day of operation, VAS values were 2.8 ± 1.1 in the RFA group and 3.6 ± 1.8 in the EVLA group (p = 0.02). Comparisons of short form-36 parameters in both groups showed them to be similar except the pain detected at postoperative 1st week (48.1 ± 5.4 for RFA, 44.9 ± 7.6 for EVLA, p = 0.04). Conclusion Results in postprocedural quality of life were found to be similar in both of the techniques. However, in terms of postoperative pain, radiofrequency ablation is still superior to the 1470 nm radial fiber laser catheters.","Sanioglu, Soner; Yerebakan, Halit; Farsak, Mustafa Bora",BioMed research international,https://doi.org/10.1155/2017/8532149; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29349083/,8

93814,Assessment of Ciliary Beat Pattern: Variability in Healthy Control Subjects Has Implications for Use as Test for Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia.,2017,"BACKGROUND Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is suggested to be likely associated with underlying immunological dysregulation. This lymphopenia poses a risk of viral infection. Data to elucidate the herpes virus infection risk in patients with PKD are lacking; therefore, we conducted a national-wide population-based cohort study to investigate the herpes virus risk in PKD patients. METHODS From the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), patients who were hospitalized with a diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease were defined as case group of PKD patients; patients without any diagnosis of PKD during the study period were grouped into the non-PKD cohort. The index date was set as the date when the patients were newly diagnosed with PKD. All study patients were followed up until the occurrence of herpes zoster infection, death, withdrawal from the NHIRD for other reasons, or until December 31, 2013. RESULTS We included 4366 PKD patients and 4366 non-PKD patients. The incidence rate and the risk of developing herpes zoster infection were estimated using multivariate stratified analyses. PKD patients had a 1.97-fold risk of herpes zoster virus infection (aHR = 1.97, 95% CI 1.17-3.31) compared with the non-PKD cohort. On multi-layer stratification, PKD patients without any comorbidities had a significantly increased risk of herpes zoster infection (aHR = 3.10, 95% CI 1.37-7.00). CONCLUSION This is the first study to reveal a high risk of severe herpes zoster infection in patients with PKD. High index suspicion of severe herpes zoster infection should be maintained in clinical professionals.","Yu, Tung-Min; Li, Chi-Yuan; Chuang, Ya-Wen; Chen, Cheng-Hsu; Lee, Brian K; Chung, Mu-Chi; Chiu, Hsien-Fu; Lin, Mei-Chen; Wu, Ming-Ju; Kao, Chia-Hung",International journal of clinical practice,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijcp.13675; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32798268/,8

Material and Methods A multi-center, retrospective and descriptive study was performed. A total of 140 patients with encrusted double J stents were collected from 5 different institutions. The novel Visual-Grading for Ureteral Encrusted Stents (V-GUES) classification system goes from A to D, increasing the severity of encrustation. Results Encrusted stents could be removed with a single intervention in 112 patients (86.8%). Type A and B encrusted stents could be successfully removed in all patients (100 % success). Type D stents had minor retrieval and stone-free rates (p = 0.006 and p<0.0001, respectively). Stone-free status was achieved after the first procedure in 89 patients (69%). Flexible ureteroscopy had a low success rate (77.7%) in type C stents (OR 0.21). Combined access had a 100 % success rate to retrieve type C encrusted stents and a 92.9% success rate for type D encrusted stents (OR 9.18). Type D stents were associated with more than one session needed to get the stent (OR: 0.11) and stones retrieved (OR 0.21). Conclusions The V-GUES grading system is associated with treatment success rates of encrusted stents retrieval and stone-free status. It is also associated with complications rate and the number of sessions needed to leave patients stent and stone free. The V-GUES classification could help counsel patients about the best treatment options and their outcomes. Further prospective studies will be needed to provide external validation.","Manzo, Braulio Omar; Alarcon, Pompeyo Stalin; Lozada, Edgard; Ojeda, Jorge; Morales, Cristian; Gökce, Mehmet Ilker; Chew, Ben H; Sepulveda, Fabio; Flores, Edson; Morales, Ignacio; Akpınar, Çağrı; Emiliani, Esteban",Journal of endourology,https://doi.org/10.1089/end.2020.1225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730863/,8

94073,Therapeutic Measures for the Novel Coronavirus: A Review of Current Status and Future Perspective.,2020-12-03,"The formation of cardiac valves depends on mechanical forces exerted by blood flow. Endocardial cells lining the interior of the heart are sensitive to these stimuli and respond by rearranging into luminal cells subjected to shear stress and abluminal cells not exposed to it. The mechanisms by which endocardial cells sense these dynamic biomechanical stimuli and how they evoke different cellular responses are largely unknown. Here, we show that blood flow activates two parallel mechanosensitive pathways, one mediated by Notch and the other by Klf2a. Both pathways negatively regulate the angiogenesis receptor Vegfr3/Flt4, which becomes restricted to abluminal endocardial cells. Its loss disrupts valve morphogenesis and results in the occurrence of Notch signaling within abluminal endocardial cells. Our work explains how antagonistic activities by Vegfr3/Flt4 on the abluminal side and by Notch on the luminal side shape cardiac valve leaflets by triggering unique differences in the fates of endocardial cells.","Fontana, Federica; Haack, Timm; Reichenbach, Maria; Knaus, Petra; Puceat, Michel; Abdelilah-Seyfried, Salim",Cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107883; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668254/,8

Methods A single surgeon observational study of 323 patients undergoing a laparoscopic myomectomy was undertaken. Data was collected prospectively over a 12-year period and analysed using SPSS. Surgical outcomes included operating time, estimated blood loss, conversion to laparotomy, intraoperative and postoperative complications and duration of inpatient stay. Results A total of 323 patients underwent a laparoscopic myomectomy over the 12-year period. The majority of fibroids removed were intramural (49%) and subserosal (33%). The mean size of fibroids removed was 7.66 ± 2.83 (7.34-7.99) cm, and the mean number was 4 ± 3.62 (3.6-4.39), with the greatest being 22 removed from a single patient. Average blood loss was 279.14 ± 221.10 (254.59-303.69) ml with mean duration of surgery and inpatient stay recorded as 112.92 ± 43.21 (107.94-117.91) min and 1.88 ± 0.95 (1.77-1.99) days, respectively. No major intraoperative complications were noted, and the conversion to laparotomy rate was 0.62%. All histology following morcellation was benign. Over the 12-year period despite increasingly large and more numerous fibroids being tackled, increasing experience resulted in a simultaneous reduction in overall blood loss, operating time and duration of inpatient stay. Conclusions Laparoscopic myomectomy is a safe and efficacious procedure that should be considered the gold standard surgical treatment option for fibroids. With experience, the procedure can be undertaken with minimal complications, a low risk of conversion to laparotomy and early discharge from hospital, even in cases of large and multiple fibroids that historically would have required the open approach. This allows even the most complex of cases to now benefit for the advantages of the minimal access approach.","Mallick, Rebecca; Odejinmi, Funlayo",Gynecological surgery,https://doi.org/10.1186/s10397-017-1025-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29200989/,8

94878,Cortical thickness is not associated with current depression in a clinical treatment study.,2017,"BACKGROUND Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a viable option for renal replacement therapy in acute kidney injury (AKI), especially in challenging times during disasters and pandemics when resources are limited. While PD techniques are well described, there is uncertainty about how to determine the amount of PD to be prescribed toward a target dose. The aim of this study is to derive practical equations to assist with the prescription of PD for AKI. METHODS Using established physiological principles behind PD clearance and membrane transport, a primary determinant of dose delivery, equations were mathematically derived to estimate dialysate volume required to achieve a target dose of PD. RESULTS The main derivative equation is VD = (1.2 × std-Kt/V × TBW)/(t dwell + 4), where VD is the total dialysate volume per day, std-Kt/V is the desired weekly dose, TBW is the total body water, and t dwell is the dwell time. VD can be expressed in terms of dwell volume, v dwell, by VD = (0.3 × std-Kt/V × TBW) - (6 × v dwell). Two further equations were derived which directly describe the mathematical relationship between t dwell and v dwell. A calculator is included as an Online Supplementary Material. CONCLUSIONS The equations are intended as a practical tool to estimate solute clearances and guide prescription of continuous PD. The estimated dialysate volume required for any dose target can be calculated from cycle duration or dwell volume. However, the exact target dose of PD is uncertain and should be adjusted according to the clinical circumstances and response to treatment. The equations presented in this article facilitate the adjustment of PD prescription toward the targeted solute clearance.","Chionh, Chang Yin; Finkelstein, Fredric O; Ronco, Claudio",Peritoneal dialysis international : journal of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis,https://doi.org/10.1177/0896860820970066; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33174468/,8
94924,Surgical and pathologic outcomes of fertility-sparing radical abdominal trachelectomy for FIGO stage IB1 cervical cancer.,2008,"BACKGROUND Most patients diagnosed with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) are older than 60 years. Despite promising treatment options for younger patients, prognosis for the elderly remains poor and efficacy of available treatment options is limited. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a scoping review to identify and summarize the current study pool available evaluating different types and combinations of (immuno) chemotherapy with a special focus on HCT-ASCT in elderly PCNSL. Relevant studies were identified through systematic searches in the bibliographic databases Medline, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and ScienceDirect (last search conducted in September 2020). For ongoing studies, we searched ClinicalTrials.gov, the German study register and the WHO registry. RESULTS In total, we identified six randomized controlled trials (RCT) with 1.346 patients, 26 prospective (with 1.366 patients) and 24 retrospective studies (with 2.629 patients). Of these, only six studies (one completed and one ongoing RCT (with 447 patients), one completed and one ongoing prospective single arm study (with 65 patients), and two retrospective single arm studies (with 122 patients)) evaluated HCT-ASCT. Patient relevant outcomes such as progression-free and overall survival and (neuro-)toxicity were adequately considered across almost all studies. The current study pool is, however, not conclusive in terms of the most effective treatment options for elderly. Main limitations were (very) small sample sizes and heterogeneous patient populations in terms of age ranges (particularly in RCTs) limiting the applicability of the results to the target population (elderly). CONCLUSIONS Although it has been shown that HCT-ASCT is probably a feasible and effective treatment option, this approach has never been investigated within a RCT including a wide range of elderly patients. A RCT comparing conventional (immuno) chemotherapy with HCT-ASCT is crucial to evaluate benefit and harms in an un-biased manner to eventually provide older PCNSL patients with the most effective treatment.","Schorb, Elisabeth; Isbell, Lisa Kristina; Illerhaus, Gerald; Ihorst, Gabriele; Meerpohl, Joerg J; Grummich, Kathrin; Nagavci, Blin; Schmucker, Christine",Cancers,https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers13174268; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34503078/,8

95054,Cellular immune responses to covid-19.,2020-07-31,"BACKGROUND AND AIM Helicobacter pylori infection is a primary cause of gastroduodenal ulcers. To investigate whether there is an association between H. pylori infection and small intestinal mucosal injury. METHODS Patients were selected from a general pool of subjects who underwent capsule endoscopy for current or past obscure gastrointestinal bleeding. Characteristics including age, gender, history, treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and/or acid suppressant, diagnosis, and H. pylori infection were investigated. Patients infected with H. pylori had positive test result, ranging 30 days before to 30 days after capsule endoscopy. Patients diagnosed with inflammatory diseases, malignant tumors, etc. were excluded. All video images were re-evaluated to count small intestinal mucosal breaks. Eligible patient variables were compared. RESULTS A total of 92 patients (30 infected with H. pylori/62 uninfected) were eligible. By univariate analysis of the number of mucosal breaks, patients treated with NSAIDs were found to have more mucosal breaks than patients untreated (38%: 8/21 vs. 18%: 13/71; p = 0.004), and the possible association was detected between patients infected with H. pylori and those who were not (67%: 14/21 vs. 37%: 26/71; p = 0.081). When comparing the H. pylori infected and uninfected patients, the rate of patients with mucosal breaks was greater in infected patients (47%: 14/30 vs. 11%: 7/62; p = 0.001). After excluding patients treated with NSAIDs, the number of mucosal breaks was also greater in patients infected with H. pylori (1.2 ± 1.5 vs. 0.38 ± 0.62; p = 0.001). CONCLUSION There is a possibility that H. pylori infection induces small intestinal mucosal injury.","Omori, Jun; Fujimori, Shunji; Kosugi, Yuki; Yukiko, Katsuya; Takagi, Shinsuke; Nishimoto, Takayoshi; Sato, Wataru; Umeda, Takamitsu; Kataoka, Hiroaki; Akimoto, Naohiko; Mitsui, Keigo; Iwakiri, Katsuhiko",Digestion,https://doi.org/10.1159/000494415; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554208/,8

Intervention strategies which recapitulate the benefits of PR are therefore needed, and digital, home-based therapies present opportunity in this space. Digital therapies also potentially offer an opportunity to standardize PR in clinical trials for new COPD therapies. Aims and Methods We aimed to create a digital application (App), Respercise®, consisting of up to 4 strengthening exercises in conjunction with Therbands and a daily physical activity program with individualized step goals, and to test its feasibility in a clinical trial. App usability was surveyed qualitatively before development iterations and deployment in a 13-week interventional clinical trial. All participants who completed the study were invited for an exit interview and performed the 5 sit-to-stand test amongst other measures. Results Feedback from clinical trial participants was positive; 97% of respondents liked the App. 88% of participants reported that it was easy to fit the exercises into their daily routine, and there was over 90% adherence for entering daily step counts. Notably, on day 90 both females and males using Respercise® alone demonstrated a 2.22- and 2.27-seconds improvement in time for 5 repetition sit-to-stand test respectively, above the 1.7 second threshold that is considered clinically meaningful in COPD. Conclusions Respercise® can be successfully deployed in clinical trials, offering the opportunity for standardization of exercise in clinical trials and with further development could have wider reach as a home-based intervention for individuals with COPD.","Yonchuk, John G; Mohan, Divya; LeBrasseur, Nathan K; George, Ashley R; Singh, Sally; Tal-Singer, Ruth",Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases,https://doi.org/10.15326/jcopdf.2020.0194; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33780603/,8
95388,"Comparing the impact of two concurrent infectious disease outbreaks on The Netherlands population, 2009, using disability-adjusted life years.",2014,"OBJECTIVE To fully address physician burnout, academic medical centers need cultures that promote well-being. One observed driver of a culture of wellness is perceived appreciation. The authors identified several contributors to perceived appreciation among faculty at a large, metropolitan academic institution through use of a novel survey. METHODS The authors surveyed clinical faculty in five departments: psychiatry, emergency medicine, internal medicine, thoracic surgery, and radiology. Two open-ended response questions assessed sources of perceived and lack of perceived appreciation in narrative form. The authors also collected data on gender and department identity. Grounded theory methodology was used to analyze the narrative responses and design thinking to brainstorm specific recommendations based on the main themes identified. RESULTS A total of 179 faculty respondents filled out the survey for an overall response rate of 29%. Major drivers of perceived appreciation were patient and families (42%); physician, trainee and non-physician colleagues (32.7%); chairs (10%); and compensation (3.3%). Major drivers of perceived lack of appreciation were disrespect for time and skill level, including inadequate staffing (30%); devaluation by a physician colleague, chief of one's service or the chair (29%); poor communication and transparency (13%); and patient and family anger (6%). CONCLUSIONS Opportunities to improve perceived appreciation include structured communication of patient gratitude, community building programs, top of licensure initiatives and accountability for physician wellness, and inclusivity efforts from organizational leaders.","Nadkarni, Ashwini; Harry, Elizabeth; Rozenblum, Ronen; Kimberly, Heidi H; Schissel, Scott L; DeOliveira, Maria C; Jackson, Amy B; Giess, Catherine S; Ashley, Stanley W; Dudley, Jessica C",Academic psychiatry : the journal of the American Association of Directors of Psychiatric Residency Training and the Association for Academic Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1007/s40596-021-01489-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046864/,8

The aim of this study was to investigate its application in patients with COVID-19-associated acute ischaemic stroke (AIS). CLINICAL RATIONALE FOR STUDY COVID-19 is a risk factor for AIS. COVID-19-associated AIS results in higher mortality and worse functional outcome. Predictors of functional outcome in COVID-19-associated AIS are required. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a retrospective observational study of patients with AIS hospitalised in seven neurological wards in Małopolska Voivodship (Poland) between August and December 2020. We gathered data concerning the patients' age, sex, presence of cardiovascular risk factors, type of treatment received, and the presence of stroke-associated infections (including pneumonia, urinary tract infection and infection of unknown source). We calculated 4C Mortality Score at stroke onset, and investigated whether there was a correlation with neurological deficit measured using the National Health Institute Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and functional outcome assessed using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at discharge. RESULTS The study included 52 patients with COVID-19-associated AIS. The 4C Mortality Score at stroke onset correlated with mRS (rs = 0.565, p < 0.01) at discharge. There was also a statistically significant difference in the mean 4C Mortality Score between patients who died and patients who survived the stroke (13.08 ± 2.71 vs. 9.85 ± 3.47, p = 0.04).

OBJECTIVE To investigate whether endoscopic radiofrequency ablation could decrease the rate of neoplastic progression. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Multicenter randomized clinical trial that enrolled 136 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Barrett esophagus containing low-grade dysplasia at 9 European sites between June 2007 and June 2011. Patient follow-up ended May 2013. INTERVENTIONS Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either endoscopic treatment with radiofrequency ablation (ablation) or endoscopic surveillance (control). Ablation was performed with the balloon device for circumferential ablation of the esophagus or the focal device for targeted ablation, with a maximum of 5 sessions allowed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was neoplastic progression to high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma during a 3-year follow-up since randomization. Secondary outcomes were complete eradication of dysplasia and intestinal metaplasia and adverse events. RESULTS Sixty-eight patients were randomized to receive ablation and 68 to receive control. Ablation reduced the risk of progression to high-grade dysplasia or adenocarcinoma by 25.0% (1.5% for ablation vs 26.5% for control; 95% CI, 14.1%-35.9%; P < .001) and the risk of progression to adenocarcinoma by 7.4% (1.5% for ablation vs 8.8% for control; 95% CI, 0%-14.7%; P = .03). Among patients in the ablation group, complete eradication occurred in 92.6% for dysplasia and 88.2% for intestinal metaplasia compared with 27.9% for dysplasia and 0.0% for intestinal metaplasia among patients in the control group (P < .001). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 19.1% of patients receiving ablation (P < .001). The most common adverse event was stricture, occurring in 8 patients receiving ablation (11.8%), all resolved by endoscopic dilation (median, 1 session). The data and safety monitoring board recommended early termination of the trial due to superiority of ablation for the primary outcome and the potential for patient safety issues if the trial continued. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this randomized trial of patients with Barrett esophagus and a confirmed diagnosis of low-grade dysplasia, radiofrequency ablation resulted in a reduced risk of neoplastic progression over 3 years of follow-up.

96253,Beirut.,2020-09-29,"BACKGROUND There is no comprehensive simulation-enhanced training curriculum to address cognitive, psychomotor, and nontechnical skills for an advanced minimally invasive procedure. OBJECTIVES 1) To develop and provide evidence of validity for a comprehensive simulation-enhanced training (SET) curriculum for an advanced minimally invasive procedure; (2) to demonstrate transfer of acquired psychomotor skills from a simulation laboratory to live porcine model; and (3) to compare training outcomes of SET curriculum group and chief resident group. SETTING University. METHODS This prospective single-blinded, randomized, controlled trial allocated 20 intermediate-level surgery residents to receive either conventional training (control) or SET curriculum training (intervention). The SET curriculum consisted of cognitive, psychomotor, and nontechnical training modules. Psychomotor skills in a live anesthetized porcine model in the OR was the primary outcome. Knowledge of advanced minimally invasive and bariatric surgery and nontechnical skills in a simulated OR crisis scenario were the secondary outcomes. Residents in the SET curriculum group went on to perform a laparoscopic jejunojejunostomy in the OR. Cognitive, psychomotor, and nontechnical skills of SET curriculum group were also compared to a group of 12 chief surgery residents. RESULTS SET curriculum group demonstrated superior psychomotor skills in a live porcine model (56 [47-62] versus 44 [38-53], P<.05) and superior nontechnical skills (41 [38-45] versus 31 [24-40], P<.01) compared with conventional training group. SET curriculum group and conventional training group demonstrated equivalent knowledge (14 [12-15] versus 13 [11-15], P = 0.47). SET curriculum group demonstrated equivalent psychomotor skills in the live porcine model and in the OR in a human patient (56 [47-62] versus 63 [61-68]; P = .21). SET curriculum group demonstrated inferior knowledge (13 [11-15] versus 16 [14-16]; P<.05), equivalent psychomotor skill (63 [61-68] versus 68 [62-74]; P = .50), and superior nontechnical skills (41 [38-45] versus 34 [27-35], P<.01) compared with chief resident group. CONCLUSION Completion of the SET curriculum resulted in superior training outcomes, compared with conventional surgery training. Implementation of the SET curriculum can standardize training for an advanced minimally invasive procedure and can ensure that comprehensive proficiency milestones are met before exposure to patient care.","Zevin, Boris; Dedy, Nicolas J; Bonrath, Esther M; Grantcharov, Teodor P",Surgery for obesity and related diseases : official journal of the American Society for Bariatric Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.soard.2016.11.019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28392018/,8
96868,Preparedness for ebolavirus disease outbreak in Japan: Necessity of Biosafety level-4 facility.,2015,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic sigmoidectomy has become the standard procedure in elective surgery for recurrent diverticular disease. To realize further benefits of this minimal invasive procedure and to offer less postoperative pain, shorter recovery time, reduced complications, and improved cosmetic results, attempts are being made to minimize the number of necessary skin incisions for trocar positioning. One method is to use only one port for laparoscopic access to perform diverticular-related elective sigmoidectomies. METHODS Between 7 July and 4 August 2009, 10 consecutive patients were referred for partial left colon resection due to multiple episodes of diverticulitis. In all cases, access to the abdomen was achieved through a 2- to 2.5-cm single incision via the umbilicus followed by insertion of the single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS™) port system. Outcomes such as change in the procedural method, operative time, postoperative complications, and length of stay were recorded. RESULTS Of the 10 consecutive sigmoidectomies, 9 were performed successfully with the SILS™ procedure using only one incision in the umbilicus. No mortalities or major complications were noted. The median operating time was 120 min, and the median postoperative hospital stay was 7 days. CONCLUSION As an alternative to the standard laparoscopic procedure, single-incision laparoscopic sigmoidectomy via the umbilicus is technically feasible and effective. This attractive procedure aims to increase the patient's comfort further after abdominal surgery.","Vestweber, Boris; Alfes, Angelika; Paul, Claudia; Haaf, Franz; Vestweber, Karl-Heinz",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-010-1090-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20464419/,8

The benefits of control systems will not be realized without widespread support from the health care team in close collaboration with industrial partners. In this review, we provide an introduction to the established field of control systems research for the everyday anesthesiologist.

97166,Suggested guidelines for vaccination of cattle in Korea.,2015,"The BCG vaccine has long been recognized for reducing the risk to suffer from infectious diseases unrelated to its target disease, tuberculosis. Evidence from human trials demonstrate substantial reductions in all-cause mortality, especially in the first week of life. Observational studies have identified an association between BCG vaccination and reduced risk of respiratory infectious disease and clinical malaria later in childhood. The mechanistic basis for these pathogen-agnostic benefits, also known as beneficial non-specific effects (NSE) of BCG have been attributed to trained immunity, or epigenetic reprogramming of hematopoietic cells that give rise to innate immune cells responding more efficiently to a broad range of pathogens. Furthermore, within trained immunity, the focus so far has been on enhanced monocyte function. However, polymorphonuclear cells, namely neutrophils, are not only major constituents of the hematopoietic compartment but functionally as well as numerically represent a prominent component of the immune system. The beneficial NSEs of the BCG vaccine on newborn sepsis was recently demonstrated to be driven by a BCG-mediated numeric increase of neutrophils (emergency granulopoiesis (EG)). And experimental evidence in animal models suggest that BCG can modulate neutrophil function as well. Together, these findings suggest that neutrophils are crucial to at least the immediate beneficial NSE of the BCG vaccine. Efforts to uncover the full gamut of mechanisms underpinning the broad beneficial effects of BCG should therefore include neutrophils at the forefront.","Brook, Byron; Schaltz-Buchholzer, Frederick; Ben-Othman, Rym; Kollmann, Tobias; Amenyogbe, Nelly",Vaccine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2021.03.092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33863572/,8

Transdiagnostic factors, such as anxiety sensitivity, could be an important component to understand how individuals experience COVID-19 specific fear, depression and anxiety. A US representative sample (5,023) completed measures including the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3, the Fear of COVID-19 Scale, the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 and the Patient Health Questionnaire-8. Analyses controlled for age, sex, race, marital status, education level, working status, household income, and COVID-19 exposure. Results were consistent with prediction. First, higher ASI-3 Total scores were associated with above average COVID-19 fear (β = 0.19). Second, the ASI-3 physical concerns subscale was the strongest predictor of COVID-19 fear; one SD increase on the ASI-3 physical concerns subscale was associated with almost a twofold risk of reaching above average levels of COVID-19 (OR = 1.93). Third, higher ASI-3 Total scores were associated with higher anxiety (β = 0.22) and depression (β = 0.20). Finally, COVID-19 fear mediated the relationship between ASI-3 Total scores and anxiety (17% of effect mediated) as well as ASI-3 Total scores and depression (16% of effect mediated). These data support the role of anxiety sensitivity in predicting fear of COVID-19 and resulting mental health.","Warren, Ann Marie; Zolfaghari, Kiumars; Fresnedo, Michelle; Bennett, Monica; Pogue, Jamie; Waddimba, Anthony; Zvolensky, Michael; Carlbring, Per; Powers, Mark B",Cognitive behaviour therapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/16506073.2021.1874505; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33595414/,8

However, in a study using an animal tumor model, somatostatin receptor antagonists were shown to label sst(2)- and sst(3)-expressing tumors in vivo better than agonists, with comparable affinity even though they are not internalized into the tumor cell. In the present study, we evaluated the in vitro binding of the antagonist (177)Lu-DOTA-pNO(2)-Phe-c (DCys-Tyr-DTrp-Lys-Thr-Cys) DTyrNH(2) ((177)Lu-DOTA-BASS) or the (177)Lu-DOTATATE agonist to sst(2)-expressing human tumor samples. METHODS Forty-eight sst(2)-positive human tumor tissue samples (9 ileal carcinoids, 10 pheochromocytomas, 7 breast carcinomas, 10 renal cell carcinomas, and 12 non-Hodgkin lymphomas) were analyzed by in vitro receptor autoradiography for the expression of sst(2), comparing the binding capacity of (177)Lu-DOTA-BASS and (177)Lu-DOTATATE in successive tissue sections. The autoradiograms were quantitated using an electronic autoradiography detection system. RESULTS In all cases, the radiolabeled antagonist bound to more receptor sites than did the agonist. The mean ratios of the antagonist (177)Lu-DOTA-BASS to the agonist (177)Lu-DOTATATE were 4.2 ± 0.5 in the 9 ileal carcinoids, 12 ± 3 in the 10 pheochromocytomas, 11 ± 4 in the 7 breast carcinomas, 5.1 ± 0.6 in the 10 renal cell carcinomas, and 4.8 ± 0.7 in the 12 non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

Using different synthetic methodologies, statistical copolymers were be obtained by batch nitroxide mediated polymerization while the gradient composition was a forced gradient by continuous addition of S during BuA polymerization (semi-batch process). These gradient copolymers have been studied by H NMR and size exclusion chromatography to characterize the gradient composition molecular structure. The evolution of the composition was correlated with the glass transition temperature () of the copolymers. The gradient copolymers exhibit one with a value in between the of polystyrene and poly(butyl acrylate), indicating that the materials did not present well defined microphase separation. Specific organization at the air-polymer interface of such copolymers has also been demonstrated by comparison between classical and attenuated total reflection (ATR) Fourier transform infra-red spectra. This bulk soft matter assembly was confirmed by AFM analysis, which showed a different morphology at the surface and in the bulk following removal of the top layer. Moreover, for the most well defined gradient composition, a specific nano-structuring was demonstrated by small angle neutron scattering.

99053,Authors' response to the letter by Dr. Eisa-Beygi.,2016,"Farming management practices are of paramount importance for soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration in carbon (C) cycling at different scales. However, due to a lack of proper methodologies, estimating the impacts of different soil management practices on overall SOC stock remains inadequately quantified. In this paper, a process-based model, Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC), was validated on midterm (9 years) and employed depending on the local climate, soil and management conditions, to assess the impacts of alternative management practices on SOC stock under two tillage systems, in a semi-arid region of Morocco. Validated results showed a good agreement between model simulated and observed values, based on the normalized root mean square error (RMSE) and Pearson correlation coefficient (r). This agreement indicates that the DNDC model could capture patterns and magnitudes changes across the climate zone, soil type, and management practices. Modeled results pointed out that, under no-tillage practice (NT), the SOC content increased by 30% compared to conventional tillage (CT). During the simulated period (9 years), the SOC sequestration potential (CSP) has been greatly improved with increased crop residue rate and application of farmyard manure (FY-manure). This increase ranged from 415 kg C/ha to 1787 kg C/ha under NT practice, and from 150 kg C/ha to 818 kg C/ha under CT system. In contrast, increasing fertilizer rate had low to negligible effect on SOC stock. On the other hand, CSP declined by 107-335 kg C/ha and by 177-354 kg C/ha under NT and CT practices respectively, when decreasing N-fertilizer rates. In light of these results, an increase in crop residue rate returned at surface after harvest and application of organic fertilizer, especially under NT practice, can substantially improve SOC stock in a semi-arid region.","Lembaid, Ibtissame; Moussadek, Rachid; Mrabet, Rachid; Douaik, Ahmed; Bouhaouss, Ahmed",Heliyon,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05889; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33437890/,8
99222,Hematopoietic mosaic chromosomal alterations increase the risk for diverse types of infection.,2021-06-07,"BACKGROUND Preliminary evaluations of behavioral interventions, referred to as pilot studies, predate the conduct of many large-scale efficacy/effectiveness trial. The ability of a pilot study to inform an efficacy/effectiveness trial relies on careful considerations in the design, delivery, and interpretation of the pilot results to avoid exaggerated early discoveries that may lead to subsequent failed efficacy/effectiveness trials. ""Risk of generalizability biases (RGB)"" in pilot studies may reduce the probability of replicating results in a larger efficacy/effectiveness trial. We aimed to generate an operational list of potential RGBs and to evaluate their impact in pairs of published pilot studies and larger, more well-powered trial on the topic of childhood obesity. METHODS We conducted a systematic literature review to identify published pilot studies that had a published larger-scale trial of the same or similar intervention. Searches were updated and completed through December 31st, 2018. Eligible studies were behavioral interventions involving youth (≤18 yrs) on a topic related to childhood obesity (e.g., prevention/treatment, weight reduction, physical activity, diet, sleep, screen time/sedentary behavior). Extracted information included study characteristics and all outcomes. A list of 9 RGBs were defined and coded: intervention intensity bias, implementation support bias, delivery agent bias, target audience bias, duration bias, setting bias, measurement bias, directional conclusion bias, and outcome bias. Three reviewers independently coded for the presence of RGBs. Multi-level random effects meta-analyses were performed to investigate the association of the biases to study outcomes. RESULTS A total of 39 pilot and larger trial pairs were identified. The frequency of the biases varied: delivery agent bias (19/39 pairs), duration bias (15/39), implementation support bias (13/39), outcome bias (6/39), measurement bias (4/39), directional conclusion bias (3/39), target audience bias (3/39), intervention intensity bias (1/39), and setting bias (0/39). In meta-analyses, delivery agent, implementation support, duration, and measurement bias were associated with an attenuation of the effect size of - 0.325 (95CI - 0.556 to - 0.094), - 0.346 (- 0.640 to - 0.052), - 0.342 (- 0.498 to - 0.187), and - 0.360 (- 0.631 to - 0.089), respectively. CONCLUSIONS Pre-emptive avoidance of RGBs during the initial testing of an intervention may diminish the voltage drop between pilot and larger efficacy/effectiveness trials and enhance the odds of successful translation.","Beets, Michael W; Weaver, R Glenn; Ioannidis, John P A; Geraci, Marco; Brazendale, Keith; Decker, Lindsay; Okely, Anthony D; Lubans, David; van Sluijs, Esther; Jago, Russell; Turner-McGrievy, Gabrielle; Thrasher, James; Li, Xiaming; Milat, Andrew J",The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12966-020-0918-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32046735/,8

99320,Lack of effect of continuous glycyrrhizin administration on the pharmacokinetics of the P-glycoprotein substrate talinolol in healthy volunteers.,2013,"BACKGROUND Out of hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) has a poor outcome. Recent non-randomized studies of ECLS (extracorporeal life support) in OHCA suggested further prospective multicenter studies to define population that would benefit from ECLS. We aim to perform a prospective randomized study comparing prehospital intraarrest hypothermia combined with mechanical chest compression device, intrahospital ECLS and early invasive investigation and treatment in all patients with OHCA of presumed cardiac origin compared to a standard of care. METHODS This paper describes methodology and design of the proposed trial. Patients with witnessed OHCA without ROSC (return of spontaneous circulation) after a minimum of 5 minutes of ACLS (advanced cardiac life support) by emergency medical service (EMS) team and after performance of all initial procedures (defibrillation, airway management, intravenous access establishment) will be randomized to standard vs. hyperinvasive arm. In hyperinvasive arm, mechanical compression device together with intranasal evaporative cooling will be instituted and patients will be transferred directly to cardiac center under ongoing CPR (cardiopulmonary resuscitation). After admission, ECLS inclusion/exclusion criteria will be evaluated and if achieved, veno-arterial ECLS will be started. Invasive investigation and standard post resuscitation care will follow. Patients in standard arm will be managed on scene. When ROSC achieved, they will be transferred to cardiac center and further treated as per recent guidelines. PRIMARY OUTCOME 6 months survival with good neurological outcome (Cerebral Performance Category 1-2). Secondary outcomes will include 30 day neurological and cardiac recovery. DISCUSSION Authors introduce and offer a protocol of a proposed randomized study comparing a combined ""hyperinvasive approach"" to a standard of care in refractory OHCA. The protocol is opened for sharing by other cardiac centers with available ECLS and cathlab teams trained to admit patients with refractory cardiac arrest under ongoing CPR. A prove of concept study will be started soon. The aim of the authors is to establish a net of centers for a multicenter trial initiation in future. ETHICS AND REGISTRATION: The protocol has been approved by an Institutional Review Board, will be supported by a research grant from Internal Grant Agency of the Ministry of Health, Czech Republic NT 13225-4/2012 and has been registered under ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01511666.","Belohlavek, Jan; Kucera, Karel; Jarkovsky, Jiri; Franek, Ondrej; Pokorna, Milana; Danda, Jiri; Skripsky, Roman; Kandrnal, Vit; Balik, Martin; Kunstyr, Jan; Horak, Jan; Smid, Ondrej; Valasek, Jaroslav; Mrazek, Vratislav; Schwarz, Zdenek; Linhart, Ales",Journal of translational medicine,https://doi.org/10.1186/1479-5876-10-163; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22883307/,8

Recent epidemiologic studies have suggested the protective effect of statins against the development of PUD although the results were inconsistent. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted with the aim to summarise all available data. METHODS A literature review was performed using MEDLINE and EMBASE database from inception to December 2017. Cohort, case-control and cross-sectional studies that compared the risk of PUD among statins users versus non-users were included. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect, generic inverse variance method. RESULTS A total of 3 studies (1 case-control and 2 retrospective cohort studies) met the eligibility criteria and were included in this meta-analysis. The risk of PUD was numerically lower among statins-users compared with non-users with the pooled OR of 0.89. However, the result did not achieve statistical significance with 95% CI of 0.67-1.18. The between-study statistical heterogeneity was high (I2 = 80%). CONCLUSIONS This systematic review and meta-analysis found that the risk of PUD was numerically lower among statin users. However, the results did not reach statistical significance. More studies are still required to further characterise this potential protective effect.","Wijarnpreecha, Karn; Panjawatanan, Panadeekarn; Leelasinjaroen, Pornchai; Ungprasert, Patompong",Arab journal of gastroenterology : the official publication of the Pan-Arab Association of Gastroenterology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajg.2020.07.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830090/,8

The increasing number of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) procedures in patients with severe aortic valvular stenosis who are considered high-risk surgical candidates has influenced our view on the diagnosis, interpretation, and significance of perioperative stroke during these procedures. Areas covered: In this perspective, we summarize changes in the definition and diagnostic criteria for stroke and transient ischemic attacks. We examine how the introduction of MRI and standardized cognitive tests has affected our understanding of the safety of TAVR procedures. Finally, we review the growing evidence regarding the role of cerebral protection technology during TAVR procedures on cognitive function. Expert commentary: Standardized MRI-based protocols and prospective evaluation of neurologic deficits with a battery of cognitive assessment tests are needed to ensure accurate recognition of postprocedural clinical events in patients undergoing TAVR procedures and to confirm the effectiveness of embolic protection technology.","Mokin, Maxim; Zivadinov, Robert; Dwyer, Michael G; Lazar, Ronald M; Hopkins, L Nelson; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Expert review of neurotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/14737175.2017.1253475; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27786568/,8

This is a multicenter, retrospective study of all adult LTRs with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from March 4th until April 28th , 2020 in six Spanish reference hospitals for lung transplantation. Clinical and radiological data, treatment characteristics, and outcomes were reviewed. Forty-four cases were identified in that period. The median time from transplantation was 4.2 (interquartile range: 1.11-7.3) years. Chest radiography showed acute parenchymal abnormalities in 32 (73%) cases. Hydroxychloroquine was prescribed in 41 (93%), lopinavir/ritonavir in 14 (32%), and tocilizumab in 19 (43%) patients. There was a strong interaction between tacrolimus and lopinavir/ritonavir in all cases. Thirty-seven (84%) patients required some degree of respiratory support and/or oxygen therapy, and 13 (30%) were admitted to intermediate or intensive critical care units. Seventeen (39%) patients had died and 20 (45%) had been discharged at the time of the last follow-up. Deceased patients had a worse respiratory status and chest X-ray on admission and presented with higher D-dimer, interleukin-6, and lactate dehydrogenase levels. In this multi-center LTR cohort, SARS-Cov-2 presented with high mortality. Additionally, the severity of disease on presentation predicted subsequent mortality.","Saez-Giménez, Berta; Berastegui, Cristina; Barrecheguren, Miriam; Revilla-López, Eva; Los Arcos, Ibai; Alonso, Rodrigo; Aguilar, Myriam; Mora, Víctor Manuel; Otero, Isabel; Reig, Juan Pablo; Quezada, Carlos Andrés; Pérez, Virginia; Valle, Manuel; Laporta, Rosalía; Deu, María; Sacanell, Judith; Bravo, Carles; Gavalda, Joan; Lopez-Meseguer, Manuel; Monforte, Víctor",American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1111/ajt.16364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33089648/,8
99916,Radiofrequency ablation for treatment of refractory gastric antral vascular ectasia (with video).,2015,"The dietary intake of flavonoids seems to be inversely related to cardiovascular mortality. The consumption of isoflavonoids is increasing in the general population, especially due to the use of food supplements and a variety of isoflavonoid-rich foods. However, detailed studies on the vascular influence of individual pure isoflavonoids are mostly missing. For this study, 16 isoflavonoids were initially screened for their vasorelaxant properties on rat aortas. The 2 most potent of them, biochanin A and glycitein, were further tested for the mechanism of action on porcine coronary arteries. They both induced an endothelium independent vascular relaxation, with EC50 below 6 and 17 µM, respectively. Biochanin A, but not glycitein, was able to block the vasoconstriction caused by KCl, CaCl2, serotonin, and U46619 in a dose-dependent manner. Another series of experiments suggested that the major mechanism of action of biochanin A was the inhibition of L-type calcium channels. Moreover, biochanin A in relatively small concentrations (2 - 4 µM) interfered with the cGMP, but not cAMP, pathway in isolated coronary arteries. These results indicate that some isoflavonoids, in particular biochanin A, are able to have vasodilatory effects in micromolar concentrations, which is of potential clinical interest for the management of cardiovascular pathologies.","Migkos, Thomas; Pourová, Jana; Vopršalová, Marie; Auger, Cyril; Schini-Kerth, Valérie; Mladěnka, Přemysl",Planta medica,https://doi.org/10.1055/a-1158-9422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32408360/,8

The disease and death of the global community from corona virus disaes 19 rapidly increasing from time to time worldwide. However, there was a lack of well-organized information about the level of risk, effects, prevention and control methods of the disease. Therefore the aim of this study was to identify and review a published level of risk, effects response to potential health emergencies, prevention, and control methods of Coronavirus Disease 2019 at the global level. METHODS A systematic review was performed after literatures were identified by searching the following online databases: medRxiv, Google scholar, PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library with supplementary hand searching of conferences. The online databases contain archives of most English biomedical journals. Scientific papers published online by the Center for Disease Control and the World Health Organization were also included for this analysis.

Angiographic aneurysm recurrence is widely used as a surrogate for treatment failure, but studies documenting the correlation of angiographic recurrence with clinical failure are limited. This trial compares the effectiveness of Matrix(2) polyglycolic/polylactic acid biopolymer-modified coils with bare metal coils and correlates the angiographic findings with clinical failure (ie, target aneurysm recurrence), a composite end point that includes any incident of posttreatment aneurysm rupture, retreatment, or unexplained death. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a multicenter randomized noninferiority trial with blinded end point adjudication. We enrolled 626 patients, divided between Matrix(2) and bare metal coil groups. The primary outcome was target aneurysm recurrence at 12 ± 3 months. RESULTS At 455 days, at least 1 target aneurysm recurrence event had occurred in 14.6% of patients treated with bare metal coils and 13.3% of Matrix(2) (P = .76, log-rank test) patients; 92.8% of target aneurysm recurrence events were re-interventions for aneurysms that had not bled after treatment, and 5.8% of target aneurysm recurrence events resulted from hemorrhage or rehemorrhage, with or without retreatment. Symptomatic re-intervention occurred in only 4 (0.6%) patients. At 455 days, 95.8% of patients with unruptured aneurysms and 90.4% of those with ruptured aneurysms were independent (mRS ≤ 2). Target aneurysm recurrence was associated with incomplete initial angiographic aneurysm obliteration, presentation with rupture, and a larger aneurysmal dome and neck size. CONCLUSIONS Tested Matrix(2) coils were not inferior to bare metal coils. Endovascular coiling of intracranial aneurysms was safe, and the rate of technical success was high. Target aneurysm recurrence is a promising clinical outcome measure that correlates well with established angiographic measurements.","McDougall, C G; Johnston, S Claiborne; Gholkar, A; Barnwell, S L; Vazquez Suarez, J C; Massó Romero, J; Chaloupka, J C; Bonafe, A; Wakhloo, A K; Tampieri, D; Dowd, C F; Fox, A J; Imm, S J; Carroll, K; Turk, A S",AJNR.

Several Mpro inhibitors have been reported with potent enzymatic inhibition and cellular antiviral activity, including GC376, boceprevir, calpain inhibitors II, and XII, with each containing a reactive warhead that covalently modifies the catalytic Cys145. Coupling structure-based drug design with the one-pot Ugi four-component reaction, we discovered one of the most potent noncovalent inhibitors, 23R (Jun8-76-3A) that is structurally distinct from the canonical Mpro inhibitor GC376. Significantly, 23R is highly selective compared with covalent inhibitors such as GC376, especially toward host proteases. The cocrystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro with 23R revealed a previously unexplored binding site located in between the S2 and S4 pockets. Overall, this study discovered 23R, one of the most potent and selective noncovalent SARS-CoV-2 Mpro inhibitors reported to date, and a novel binding pocket in Mpro that can be explored for inhibitor design.","Kitamura, Naoya; Sacco, Michael Dominic; Ma, Chunlong; Hu, Yanmei; Townsend, Julia Alma; Meng, Xiangzhi; Zhang, Fushun; Zhang, Xiujun; Ba, Mandy; Szeto, Tommy; Kukuljac, Adis; Marty, Michael Thomas; Schultz, David; Cherry, Sara; Xiang, Yan; Chen, Yu; Wang, Jun",Journal of medicinal chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jmedchem.1c00509; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33891389/,8
100854,Does β2-adrenergic stimulation attenuate fluid extravasation during hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass? An experimental study in pigs.,2012,"INTRODUCTION Surgery is currently the definitive treatment for early-stage breast cancer. However, the rate of positive surgical margins remains unacceptably high. The human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) is a naturally occurring protein in human thyroid tissue, which enables cells to concentrate radionuclides. The hNIS has been exploited to image and treat thyroid cancer. We therefore investigated the potential of a novel oncolytic vaccinia virus GLV1h-153 engineered to express the hNIS gene for identifying positive surgical margins after tumor resection via positron emission tomography (PET). Furthermore, we studied its role as an adjuvant therapeutic agent in achieving local control of remaining tumors in an orthotopic breast cancer model. METHODS GLV-1h153, a replication-competent vaccinia virus, was tested against breast cancer cell lines at various multiplicities of infection (MOIs). Cytotoxicity and viral replication were determined. Mammary fat pad tumors were generated in athymic nude mice. To determine the utility of GLV-1h153 in identifying positive surgical margins, 90% of the mammary fat pad tumors were surgically resected and subsequently injected with GLV-1h153 or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) in the surgical wound. Serial Focus 120 microPET images were obtained six hours post-tail vein injection of approximately 600 μCi of 124I-iodide. RESULTS Viral infectivity, measured by green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression, was time- and concentration-dependent. All cell lines showed less than 10% of cell survival five days after treatment at an MOI of 5. GLV-1h153 replicated efficiently in all cell lines with a peak titer of 27 million viral plaque forming units (PFU) ( <10,000-fold increase from the initial viral dose ) by Day 4. Administration of GLV-1h153 into the surgical wound allowed positive surgical margins to be identified via PET scanning. In vivo, mean volume of infected surgically resected residual tumors four weeks after treatment was 14 mm3 versus 168 mm3 in untreated controls (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to our knowledge to demonstrate a novel vaccinia virus carrying hNIS as an imaging tool in identifying positive surgical margins of breast cancers in an orthotopic murine model. Moreover, our results suggest that GLV-1h153 is a promising therapeutic agent in achieving local control for positive surgical margins in resected breast tumors.","Gholami, Sepideh; Chen, Chun-Hao; Belin, Laurence J; Lou, Emil; Fujisawa, Sho; Antonacci, Caroline; Carew, Amanda; Chen, Nanhai G; De Brot, Marina; Zanzonico, Pat B; Szalay, Aladar A; Fong, Yuman",Breast cancer research : BCR,https://doi.org/10.1186/bcr3404; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23506710/,8

101360,Preventing a Parallel Pandemic - A National Strategy to Protect Clinicians' Well-Being.,2020-05-13,"BACKGROUND Synthetic materials have traditionally been used for tissue reconstruction in thoracic surgery. New biomaterials have been tested in other areas of surgery with good results. The aim of our study is to evaluate our initial experience using prostheses in extended thoracic surgery. METHODS A review was performed of all patients who underwent extended surgical procedures requiring soft tissue reconstruction with bioprosthetic materials after thoracic surgery from August 2009 to August 2011. A total of 44 consecutive patients were included. Operations involved radical pleurectomy and decortication for mesothelioma (n = 29), extended operations for thoracic malignancies (n = 8), surgery for trauma or perforated organs or complications (n = 6), and for benign infectious causes (n = 1). RESULTS A total of 76 patches were used in 44 patients (median of 2; range 1 to 3 per patient). Median hospital stay was 13 (range 5 to 149) days. Three patients died during the postoperative period (6.8%); pulmonary embolism 5 days after intrapericardial pneumonectomy with chest wall reconstruction, fatal pneumonia 26 days after radical pleurectomy and decortication for mesothelioma, and bronchopleural fistula 11 days after pneumonectomy with diaphragm and atrium excision for lung cancer after initial chemoradiotherapy. No other surgical exploration or removal of patches has been required for infection. CONCLUSIONS Our initial experience of using bioprosthetic patches for soft tissue reconstruction in thoracic surgery has proven satisfactory with overall acceptable results. The infection rates are low even when a proportion of procedures were performed under contaminated environments. Biologic prosthesis should be part of the surgical options to reconstruct soft tissues in thoracic surgery.","Barua, Anupama; Catton, James A; Socci, Laura; Raurell, Anna; Malik, Munib; Internullo, Eveline; Martin-Ucar, Antonio E",The Annals of thoracic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.athoracsur.2012.07.001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22959570/,8

101444,Research as a part of public health emergency response.,2013,"BACKGROUND This study examined the stratified anatomy of the traditional acupuncture point Jingbi and the neuroanatomical relationship between Jingbi and the brachial plexus, and investigated neural pathways that could be affected by acupuncture stimulation at Jingbi. METHODS Twelve dissected specimens were used to study the pathway of an acupuncture needle inserted at Jingbi. The stratified anatomy and the neuroanatomical relationship between Jingbi and the brachial plexus were studied. Our samples were grouped by gender and cause of death for comparative analysis. RESULTS All needles (n = 24, on both sides of a total of 12 cadavers) punctured the anterior scalene muscle medial to the brachial plexus and external jugular vein, lateral to the phrenic nerve and internal jugular vein, and superior to the clavicle and subclavian artery/vein. The depth of needle insertion at Jingbi on the right side of male samples was 28.0 (interquartile range (IQR), 22.5-30.8) mm, which was approximately 8 mm deeper than for female subjects (p < 0.05). The needle was 3.0 (IQR, 2.0-5.0) mm and 7.0 (IQR, 5.5-8.0) mm medial to the brachial plexus on the left and right sides, respectively. CONCLUSION Deep needle insertion at Jingbi can puncture the anterior scalene muscle. The mechanism of action of acupuncture stimulation at Jingbi might be related to its close relationship with the brachial plexus. Significant differences in needling depth were observed when our samples were grouped by gender.

101603,Highlights from the American Transplant Congress 2020.,2020-10-20,"Background: Suboptimal nutritional status of a newborn is a risk factor for short- and long-term morbidity and mortality. The objectives of this review were to assess the efficacy and effectiveness of neonatal synthetic vitamin A supplementation, dextrose gel and probiotic supplementation for prevention of morbidity and mortality during infancy in low and middle-income countries. Methods: We included randomized trials. Primary outcome was all-cause mortality. We conducted electronic searches on multiple databases. Data were meta-analyzed to obtain relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). Studies for vitamin A and Probiotics were analyzed separately. No studies were found for dextrose gel supplementation during neonatal period. The overall rating of evidence was determined by Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results: Sixteen studies assessed the effect of vitamin A supplementation during the neonatal period. Based on pooled data from community-based studies only, there was no significant effect of vitamin A on all-cause mortality at age 1 month (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.90, 1.08), 6 months (RR 0.98; 95% CI 0.89-1.08) and 12 months (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.94, 1.14) but increased risk of bulging fontanelle (RR 1.53, 95% CI 1.12, 2.09). The overall quality of evidence was high for the above outcomes. Thirty-three studies assessed the effect of probiotic supplementation during the neonatal period and were mostly conducted in the hospital setting. Probiotics reduced the risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66, 0.96), necrotizing enterocolitis (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.35, 0.59) and neonatal sepsis (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.70, 0.86). The grade ratings for the above three outcomes were high. Conclusions: Vitamin A supplementation during the neonatal period does not reduce all-cause neonatal or infant mortality in low and middle-income countries in the community setting. Probiotic supplementation during the neonatal period seems to reduce all-cause mortality, NEC, and sepsis in babies born low birth weight and/or preterm in the hospital setting.","Imdad, Aamer; Rehman, Faseeha; Davis, Evan; Attia, Suzanna; Ranjit, Deepika; Surin, Gamael Saint; Lawler, Sarah; Smith, Abigail; Bhutta, Zulfiqar A",Nutrients,https://doi.org/10.3390/nu12030791; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32192165/,8
101677,Contemporary psychological perspectives of personality disorders.,2021-07-20,"BACKGROUND Transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) is common among children and adolescents. The aims of this study were to identify clinical differences between patients with vasovagal syncope and those with epileptic seizures, which account for a large proportion of TLOC cases, and to evaluate the effectiveness of various diagnostic tests. METHODS The medical records of 160 children and adolescents with TLOC were analyzed retrospectively, and age, sex, clinical symptoms, and trigger factors were recorded. The cardiological and neurological evaluations performed included electrocardiograms, computed tomography scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalograms (EEGs), echocardiograms, and head-up tilt tests (HUTTs). Overall assessments of the 160 patients generated final diagnoses. RESULTS The mean age of patients was 14.6 years old and TLOC occurred more frequently among girls (59.4%). The most common final diagnosis was vasovagal syncope (n = 102, 63.4%), followed by undetermined (n = 21, 13.1%) and epileptic seizures (n = 17, 10.6%). There were many other diagnoses, including cardiogenic syncope (1.3%). Patients diagnosed with vasovagal syncope were much more likely to have dizziness or light-headedness and blurred vision as pre-symptoms (p < 0.05), whereas patients diagnosed with epileptic seizures were more likely to have convulsions as an accompanying sign (p < 0.05). In addition, standing up was the most significant trigger factor for TLOC among those diagnosed with vasovagal syncope (p < 0.05). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the HUTT for vasovagal syncope were 95.1%, 75.0%, and 91.8%, respectively. Similarly, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of EEGs for epileptic seizures were 80.0%, 70.6%, and 80.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION Vasovagal syncope and epileptic seizures should be considered as possible causes of most cases of TLOC in children and adolescents. An accurate case history and appropriate evaluation are essential for correct diagnoses.","Choi, Young Ju; Han, Mi Young; Lee, Eun Hye",Pediatrics and neonatology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pedneo.2020.06.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32680815/,8
101798,Application of a 'Baseball' Suture Technique in Uterine Myomectomy Following Laparoscopic Enucleation of Uterine Leiomyoma (Fibroid).,2018,"Currently no tool exists to assess proceduralist skill at chest tube insertion. As inadequate doctor procedural competence has repeatedly been associated with adverse events, there is a need for a tool to assess procedural competence. This study aims to develop and examine the validity of a tool to assess competency at insertion of a chest tube, using either the Seldinger technique or blunt dissection. A 5-domain 100-point assessment tool was developed inline with British Thoracic Society guidelines and international consensus—the Chest Tube Insertion Competency Test (TUBE-iCOMPT). The instrument was used to assess chest tube insertion in mannequins and live patients. 29 participants (9 novices, 14 intermediate and 6 advanced) were tested by 2 blinded expert examiners on 2 occasions. The tool's validity was examined by demonstrating: (1) stratification of participants according to expected level of expertise (analysis of variance), and (2) test-retest and intertester reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient). The intraclass correlation coefficient of repeated scores for the Seldinger technique and blunt dissection, were 0.92 and 0.91, respectively, for test-retest results, and 0.98 and 0.95, respectively, for intertester results. Clear stratification of scores according to participant experience was seen (p<0.0001). There was no significant difference between scores obtained using mannequins or live patients. This study has validated the TUBE-iCOMPT, which could now be incorporated into chest tube insertion training programmes, providing a way to document acquisition of skill, guide individualised teaching, and assist with the assessment of the adequacy of clinician training.","Salamonsen, Matthew R; Bashirzadeh, Farzad; Ritchie, Alexander J; Ward, Helen E; Fielding, David I K",Thorax,https://doi.org/10.1136/thoraxjnl-2013-204914; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24671711/,8

102197,Misogyny in Medicine.,2021-06-17,"Lipids are essential constituents of cellular membranes. Once regarded merely as structural components, lipids have taken centre stage with the discovery of their roles in cell signalling and in the generation of bioactive metabolites. Lipids regulate many physiological functions of cells and alterations in membrane lipid metabolism are associated with major diseases including cancer, Type II diabetes, cardiovascular disease and immune disorders. Understanding lipid diversity, their synthesis and metabolism to generate signalling molecules will provide insight into the fundamental function of the cell. This review summarises the biosynthesis of the lipids of the mammalian cell; phospholipids, sphingolipids and cholesterol and how lipid diversity is achieved. The fatty acids (FAs) are the main building blocks of lipids and contribute to the diversity. Lipid synthesis is intimately connected to their transport within cells; the contribution by proteins that transport lipids, lipid transport proteins will be described. Cellular lipids are metabolised by phospholipases, lipid kinases and phosphatases to make new bioactive metabolites. These transient bioactive metabolites allow cells to respond to the external environment to maintain cellular health. The function of individual metabolites is also highlighted. Bioactive metabolites can be second messengers, or released to the external medium to regulate other cells. Alternatively, bioactive lipids also provide a platform for reversible recruitment of proteins to membranes using their lipid-binding domains. The wide range of physiological processes in which a specific involvement of lipids has been identified explains the need for lipid diversity present in mammalian cells.","Cockcroft, Shamshad",Essays in biochemistry,https://doi.org/10.1042/ebc20200067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34415021/,8

102748,Comparison between iloprost and alprostadil for protection against ischemia/reperfusion injury in a rat model,2018,"UNLABELLED Research into placebo effects has convincingly shown that inducing positive outcome expectations can reduce pain and other physical sensations. However, the comparative effects of different expectation inductions, such as verbal suggestion or mental imagery, and their generic effects on physical sensitivity, to different sensations such as pain, itch, and fatigue, are still largely unknown. In the current study, we assessed the individual and combined effects of verbal suggestion and imagery on pain, itch, and fatigue as indicators of physical sensitivity in a randomized study design. Healthy participants (n = 116) were given an inert (placebo) capsule that was said to be effective for reducing physical sensitivity in either the majority (positive verbal suggestion) or the minority (control verbal suggestion) of users. Subsequently, they imagined either their best possible health (positive imagery) or a typical day (control imagery). Sensitivity to pain, itch, and fatigue was tested using a cold pressor test, histamine iontophoresis, and a bicycle test, respectively. Heart rate and skin conductance were recorded continuously. Results showed that positive verbal suggestion and imagery successfully induced positive expectations, but they did not affect physical sensitivity, as indicated by sensitivity to pain, itch, or fatigue, or concurrent physiological responses. These results could indicate that the specificity and concreteness of expectation inductions might be important for their applicability in the treatment of physical symptoms.

103008,Highly enhanced ELISA sensitivity using acetylated chitosan surfaces.,2020-08-19,"BACKGROUND To evaluate the feasibility and the safety of robotic single-site hysterectomy (RSSH) in low risk early endometrial cancer. METHODS Patients with clinical low risk early endometrial cancer were enrolled onto a prospective cohort trial. All surgical procedures were performed through a single 2-2.5 cm umbilical incision, with a multichannel system consisting of a five-lumen port providing access for two single-site instruments (da Vinci Si Surgical System, Intuitive Surgical, Sunnyvale, CA), the 8.5 mm 3D HD endoscope, a 5/10 mm accessory port, and an insufflation adaptor. RESULTS Between December 2011 and June 2012, a total of 17 patients were included in our pilot study. The median age of the patients was 64 years (range, 42-84 years), and median body mass index was 26.6 kg/m(2) (range, 18-52 kg/m(2)). One patient was excluded from the study as a result of pelvic metastasis during inspection of abdominal cavity, and another patient was converted to vaginal surgery as a result of problems of hypercapnia. The median docking time, console time, and total operative time was 8 min (range, 5-14 min), 48 min (range, 45-51 min), and 90 min (range, 70-147 min), respectively. The median blood loss was 75 mL (range, 50-150 mL). No laparoscopy/laparotomy conversion was registered. The median time to discharge was 2 days (range, 1-3 days). Neither intraoperative nor postoperative complications occurred. At a median of 7.5 months' follow-up, all patients were disease-free. CONCLUSIONS RSSH is technically feasible in patients affected by low risk early endometrial cancer. Additional studies with gynecologic oncologic cases should be performed to explore the possible benefits of RSSH.","Vizza, Enrico; Corrado, Giacomo; Mancini, Emanuela; Baiocco, Ermelinda; Patrizi, Lodovico; Fabrizi, Luana; Colantonio, Luca; Cimino, Monica; Sindico, Stefano; Forastiere, Ester",Annals of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1245/s10434-013-2922-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23468046/,8
103089,Issue Highlights.,2021-03-01,"Objective: Relatively little has been reported about the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on emergency ambulance services. We describe the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on the emergency ambulance system in Victoria, Australia.Methods: We performed an interrupted time series analysis of consecutive calls for ambulance from January 2018 to February 2021, including two waves of COVID-19. The COVID-19 lockdown period included seven months of stay-at-home restrictions (16/03/2020-18/10/2020). Nineteen weeks of post-lockdown data were included (19/10/2020-28/02/2021).Results: In total, 2,356,326 consecutive calls were included. COVID-19 lockdown was associated with an absolute reduction of 64,991 calls (almost 2,100 calls/week). According to time series analysis, lockdown was associated with a 12.6% reduction in weekly calls (IRR =0.874 [95% CI 0.811, 0.941]), however no change in long-term trend (IRR =1.000 [95% CI 0.996, 1.003]). During lockdown, the long-term trend of attendances to patients with suspected acute coronary syndromes (ACS, IRR =1.006 [95% CI 1.004, 1.009]) and mental health-related issues (IRR =1.005 [95% CI 1.002, 1.008]) increased. After lockdown, the call volume was 5.6% below pre-COVID-19 predictions (IRR =0.944 [95% CI 0.909, 0.980]), however attendances for suspected ACS were higher than predicted (IRR =1.069 [95% CI 1.009, 1.132]). Ambulance response times deteriorated, and total case times were longer than prior to the pandemic, driven predominantly by extended hospital transfer times.Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic had a dramatic impact on the emergency ambulance system. Despite lower call volumes post-lockdown than predicted, we observed deteriorating ambulance response times, extended case times and hospital delays. The pattern of attendance to patients with suspected ACS potentially highlights the collateral burden of delaying treatment for urgent conditions.","Andrew, Emily; Nehme, Ziad; Stephenson, Michael; Walker, Tony; Smith, Karen",Prehospital emergency care : official journal of the National Association of EMS Physicians and the National Association of State EMS Directors,https://doi.org/10.1080/10903127.2021.1944409; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34152925/,8
103101,Recent trends in the management of depression in persons with cancer.,2021-07-01,"Introduction: Vaccination remains very effective in stimulating protective immune responses against infections. An important task in antibody and vaccine preparation is to choose an optimal carrier that will ensure a high immune response. Particularly promising in this regard are nanoscale particle carriers. An antigen that is adsorbed or encapsulated by nanoparticles can be used as an adjuvant to optimize the immune response during vaccination. A very popular antigen carrier used for immunization and vaccination is gold nanoparticles, with are being used to make new vaccines against viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections.Areas covered: This review summarizes what is currently known about the use of gold nanoparticles as an antigen carrier and adjuvant to prepare antibodies in vivo and design vaccines against viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections. The basic principles, recent advances, and current problems in the use of gold nanoparticles are discussed.Expert opinion: Gold nanoparticles can be used as adjuvants to increase the effectiveness of vaccines by stimulating antigen-presenting cells and ensuring controlled antigen release. Studying the characteristics of the immune response obtained from the use of gold nanoparticles as a carrier and an adjuvant will permit the particles' potential for vaccine design to be increased.","Dykman, Lev A",Expert review of vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2020.1758070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32306785/,8

Their use has been limited by venous thromboembolism (VTE) risk warnings from licensing authorities. The objective was to evaluate the VTE risk of JAKi in patients with IMIDs. METHODS Systematic searches of MEDLINE and EMBASE databases from inception to 30th September 2020 were conducted. Phase II and III double blinded randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of JAKi at licensed doses were included. RCTs with no placebo arm, Long term extension studies, post hoc, and pooled analyses were excluded. Three researchers independently extracted data on JAKi and placebo exposure and VTE (pulmonary emboli and deep vein thromboses) events and assessed study quality. RESULTS A total of 42 studies were included, from an initial search of 619. There were 6,542 JAKi patient exposure years (PEY), compared to 1,578 placebo PEY. There were 15 VTE events in the JAKi group and four in the placebo group. The pooled Incidence rate ratio (IRR) of VTE, PE and DVT in patients receiving JAKi were 0.68 (95% CI 0.36 to 1.29), 0.44 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.70) and 0.59 (95% CI 0.31 to 1.15), respectively. CONCLUSION This meta-analysis of RCT data defines the VTE risk with JAKi as a class in IMID patients. The pooled IRR do not support current warnings around VTE risk for JAKi. The findings will aid continued development of clinical guidelines for the use of JAKi in IMIDs.","Yates, Mark; Mootoo, Amanda; Adas, Maryam; Bechman, Katie; Rampes, Sanketh; Patel, Vishit; Qureshi, Sumera; Cope, Andrew P; Norton, Sam; Galloway, James B",Arthritis & rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1002/art.41580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33174384/,8

METHODS Two hundred fifteen patients who underwent second-look laparoscopy (SLL) 6 months after laparoscopic myomectomy at our hospital between 2010 and 2014 were retrospectively reviewed. The incidence, numbers, types, and extent of adhesions were evaluated according to the more comprehensive adhesion scoring method. Propensity score matching (PS) (1:1) between the groups was performed by using the diameter of the largest myoma, the number of enucleated myomas, and the type of adhesion barrier. RESULTS Running baseball sutures and running sutures were applied to 28 and 187 patients with unidirectional BS and absorbable thread, respectively, to close the incised serosal wounds enucleating largest myomas during laparoscopic myomectomy. After PS matching for the patients, surgical findings and the incidence of postoperative wound adhesions were compared between the groups, including 22 patients each. The surgical findings were similar between the groups, except for the total surgical duration and blood loss (medians), which were significantly shorter and lower in the BS group than in the absorbable thread group (70 vs. 100 min; p = 0.01, 50 vs. 100 mL; p = 0.02). Regarding findings of SLL, no significant differences in the incidence of postoperative wound adhesions were found between the groups (BS, 4/22 [18.2%] versus absorbable thread, 8/22 [36.4%]; p = 0.31). CONCLUSION Our data indicated that the incidence of postoperative adhesion following the use of BS for wound closure in laparoscopic myomectomy was similar to that following the use of conventional suture.","Kumakiri, Jun; Kikuchi, Iwaho; Kitade, Mari; Ozaki, Rie; Kawasaki, Yu",Gynecologic and obstetric investigation,https://doi.org/10.1159/000510511; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32932256/,8

Current estimates show that it affects millions of people worldwide and causes a serious socioeconomic burden. Mitophagy plays key roles in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) osteoblastic differentiation, mineralization, and survival. Apelin is an endogenous adipokine that participates in bone homeostasis. This study was performed to determine the role of Apelin in the osteoporosis process and whether it affects mitophagy, survival, and osteogenic capacity of BMSCs in in vitro and in vivo models of osteoporosis. Our results demonstrated that Apelin was down-regulated in ovariectomized-induced osteoporosis rats and Apelin-13 treatment activated mitophagy in BMSCs, ameliorating oxidative stress and thereby reviving osteogenic function via AMPK-α phosphorylation. Besides, Apelin-13 administration restored bone mass and microstructure as well as reinstated mitophagy, enhanced osteogenic function in OVX rats.

The ability of first-trimester ultrasound screening to detect different malformations was variable. A recent systematic review concluded that the use of a standardized anatomical protocol was the most crucial factor to improve the sensitivity of first-trimester ultrasound screening for anomalies. Standardized sectional scans have long been used for routine anatomy screening during the second trimester. However, during the first trimester, the majority of the previous studies have described the observation of anatomical structures but have not specified clearly the standard sectional views. OBJECTIVE We aimed to determine the performance of routine first trimester scans using a standardized anatomical protocol for detecting structural abnormalities in China. STUDY DESIGN This was a large retrospective study involving 59063 sequential unselected pregnancies. 11-13+6week scans were performed in a single center during a 7-year span. All fetuses were examined following a pre-defined protocol for standardized views. RESULTS From October 2008 to December 2015, first trimester scans were performed in 53349 pregnant women with available outcome. Of these, there were 1578 (3%) pregnancies that presented with at least one fetal structural abnormality. The detection rate for first-trimester screening was 43·1% (95%CI 40·6%-45·5%). Routine first trimester scans detected 95·6% of abdominal wall defects, 66·3% of nervous system defects, 33·8% of limbs and skeleton malformations, 30·8% of facial and 21·2% of urogenital, 18·4% of thoracic and lung abnormalities and 4·1% of gastrointestinal tract abnormalities. 37·7% of cardiac defects was identified during the first trimester and included 57·9% of major cardiac defects and 2·6% of mild cardiac defects. A robust high detection rate for anencephaly, exencephaly, cephalocele, holoprosencephalys, exomphalos, gastroschisis, pentalogy of Cantrell, sirenomelia and Body stalk anomaly was achieved during routine first trimester scans. CONCLUSIONS A standardized anatomical protocol is advised when performing routine first-trimester ultrasound screening. It is recommended that screening for severe structural abnormalities should be extended to the first trimester.","Liao, Yimei; Wen, Huaxuan; Ouyang, Shuyuan; Yuan, Ying; Bi, Jingru; Guan, Yong; Fu, Qian; Yang, Xia; Guo, Wenjia; Huang, Yi; Zeng, Qing; Qin, Yue; Xiang, Haishan; Li, Shengli",American journal of obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajog.2020.10.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33127430/,8

Mechanical flow restoration, usually by thrombectomy, is typically performed in large cerebral vessels. Current mechanical thrombectomy devices have limited utility in smaller vessels that are more difficult to access, such as the anterior cerebral artery (ACA). We present two cases where successful flow restoration of an intraoperative acutely occluded or thrombotic ACA was rapidly achieved by balloon dilation using a new coaxial dual-lumen balloon catheter.

Compared with influenza viruses, coronaviruses have a longer incubation period and the patients with coronaviruses' syndromes develop more severe diseases requiring frequent hospitalizations and intensive care admissions. The aim was to explore the relationships between seasonal influenza vaccination and coronavirus infection and to understand whether this hypothetic role by the flu vaccines modifies SARS-CoV-2 infection's outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS In this retrospective, multicenter study, we enrolled 952 patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection; 448 were admitted to our two main hospitals in Ferrara territory, while the remaining 504 were isolated at home. We compared the group of patients who had been vaccinated for influenza in the previous 12 months to that of unvaccinated patients. RESULTS Significant differences were found for both the need for hospitalization and 30-day mortality between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients. We found age to be the only independent risk factor for a worse 30-day prognosis, while gender, influenza vaccinations and age itself were independent risk factors for undergoing hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS In our groups of patients, we found a relationship between seasonal influenza vaccinations and SARS-CoV-2 infection. Age seems to be the main risk factor for short-term mortality in COVID-19 inpatients, while the influenza vaccination is, together with gender and age itself, a determining factor in predicting the need for hospitalization.","Greco, S; Bella, A; Bonsi, B; Fabbri, N; Califano, A; Morrone, S; Chessa, P; Pistolesi, C; Zuliani, G; De Motoli, F; Manfredini, R; De Giorgi, A; Passaro, A",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,https://doi.org/10.26355/eurrev_202103_25441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33829464/,8

105994,A novel liquid biopsy-based approach for highly specific cancer diagnostics: mitigating false responses in assaying patient plasma-derived circulating microRNAs through combined SERS and plasmon-enhanced fluorescence analyses.,2020-06-03,"BACKGROUND Unidirectional barbed suture (UBS) has been widely used for surgery in recent years, especially for urethrovesical anastomosis (UVA) during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). However, the efficacy and safety comparing it with conventional non-barbed suture (CS) for UVA is still controversial. AIMS The objective of this study is to assess the current evidence regarding the efficacy and safety of UBS compared with CS for UVA during RARP. METHODS We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library, SinoMed (Chinese) and other databases on Oct. 9, 2014 to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and other comparative studies evaluating these two types of suture. The outcome measures included anastomosis time operative time, posterior reconstruction (PR) time, postoperative leakage (PL) rate and continence rates at different time points (4-6 weeks, 3 months, 6-12 months) after surgery. Secondary outcomes included estimated blood loss (EBL) and length of catheterization (LOC). RESULTS Three RCTs and six observational studies including 786 cases were identified. Meta-analysis of extractable data showed that use of UBS could significantly reduce anastomosis time (weighted mean difference [WMD]:-3.98min; 95% confidence interval [CI], -6.02 -1.95; p = 0.0001), operative time (WMD:-10.06min; 95% CI, -15.45--4.67; p = 0.0003) and PR time (WMD:-0.93min; 95% CI, -1.52--0.34; p = 0.002). No significant difference was found in PL rate, EBL, LOC, or continence rates at 4-6 weeks, 3 months and 6-12 months after surgery. CONCLUSIONS Our meta-analysis indicates that UBS appears to be safe and efficient as CS for UVA during RARP with not only shorter anastomosis time, operative time, PR time, but also equivalent PL rate, EBL, LOC, and continence rates at 4-6 weeks, 3 months and 6-12 months after surgery. For the inherent limitations of the eligible studies, future more persuasive RCTs are needed to confirm and update our findings.","Li, Huixin; Liu, Chunxiao; Zhang, Haibin; Xu, Wenfeng; Liu, Jianhua; Chen, Yong; Li, Tangxuan; Li, Bin; Wu, Zhenquan; Xia, Taolin",PloS one,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0131167; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26135310/,8

Here, we report that metastatic colon cancer contains clonally derived tumor cells with all of the critical properties expected of stem cells, including self-renewal and the ability to differentiate into mature colon cells. Additionally, when injected into mice, these cells initiated tumors that closely resemble human cancer. Karyotype analyses of parental and clonally derived tumor cells expressed many consistent (clonal) along with unique chromosomal aberrations, suggesting the presence of chromosomal instability in the cancer stem cells. Thus, this new model for cancer origin and metastatic progression includes features of both the hierarchical model for cancerous stem cells and the stochastic model, driven by the observation of chromosomal instability.","Odoux, Christine; Fohrer, Helene; Hoppo, Toshitaka; Guzik, Lynda; Stolz, Donna Beer; Lewis, Dale W; Gollin, Susanne M; Gamblin, T Clark; Geller, David A; Lagasse, Eric",Cancer research,https://doi.org/10.1158/0008-5472.can-07-5779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18757407/,8

106612,Limbic and paralimbic structures driving ictal central apnea.,2019,"The error rate of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of RNA viruses is important in maintaining genetic diversity for viral adaptation and fitness. Numerous studies have shown that mutagen-resistant RNA virus variants display amino acid mutations in the RdRp and other replicase subunits, which in turn exhibit an altered fidelity phenotype affecting viral fitness, adaptability, and pathogenicity. St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV), like its close relative West Nile virus (WNV), is a mosquito-borne flavivirus which has the ability to cause neuroinvasive disease in humans. Here, we describe the successful generation of multiple ribavirin-resistant populations containing a shared amino acid mutation in the SLEV RdRp (E416K). These E416K mutants also displayed resistance to the antiviral T-1106, an RNA mutagen similar to ribavirin. Structural modeling of the E416K polymerase mutation indicate its location in the pinky finger domain of the RdRp, distant from the active site. Deep-sequencing of the E416K mutant revealed lower genetic diversity than wildtype SLEV after growth in both vertebrate and invertebrate cells. Phenotypic characterization showed E416K mutants displayed similar or increased replication in mammalian cells, as well as modest attenuation in mosquito cells, consistent with previous work with WNV high-fidelity variants. In addition, attenuation was limited to mosquito cells with a functional RNA interference (RNAi) response, suggesting an impaired capacity to escape RNAi could contribute to attenuation of high-fidelity variants. Our results provide increased evidence that RNA mutagen resistance arises through modulation of the RdRp and gives further insight into the consequences of altered fidelity of flaviviruses.","Griesemer, Sara B; Kramer, Laura D; Van Slyke, Greta A; Pata, Janice D; Gohara, David D; Cameron, Craig E; Ciota, Alexander T",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000682; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27959789/,8

(Saururaceae) is used traditionally in Asian countries to treat various disease symptoms. OBJECTIVE To study the effect of H. cordata ethyl acetate (HC-EA) extract on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS HFD fed rats were orally dosed with HC-EA (100, 200, or 300 mg/kg) once daily for 8 weeks and the lipid profiles and protein expressions in hepatocytes were evaluated. RESULTS HFD rats showed an increase (p < 0.05) in the plasma lipid levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), free fatty acids (FFAs), and reduced the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Treatment with HC-EA extract (300 mg/kg) restored the changes in plasma lipid levels of TC, TG, LDL, FFA, and HDL in HFD-fed rats by 34.8, 31.1, 51.4, 32.4, and 56.3%, respectively, compared with control rats (p < 0.01). HC-EA treatment also decreased the hepatic lipid accumulation (p < 0.001 at 300 mg/kg) and improved hepatic histological lesions. HC-EA extract enhanced AMPK phosphorylation and its primary downstream targeting enzyme, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), up-regulated the gene expression of carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1 (CPT-1), and down-regulated sterol regulatory element binding protein 1, fatty acid synthase, and glutamate pyruvate transaminase protein levels in the livers of HFD-fed rats. Further, the increased expression of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) composition such as CYP2E1 and CYP4A was also suppressed. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Data suggest that HC-EA extract might act by regulating the AMPK-dependent pathway and related mediators and might be used in treating obesity-related liver diseases.","Kang, Hyun; Koppula, Sushruta",Pharmaceutical biology,https://doi.org/10.3109/13880209.2014.923002; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25272018/,8
107092,Expression Profile and Prognostic Values of Mini-Chromosome Maintenance Families (MCMs) in Breast Cancer.,2020-08-24,"Various methods of assessing the depth of anesthesia (DoA) and reducing intraoperative awareness during general anesthesia have been extensively studied in anesthesiology. However, most of the DoA monitors do not include brain activity signal modeling. Here, we propose a new algorithm termed the cortical activity index (CAI) based on the brain activity signals. In this study, we enrolled 32 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Raw electroencephalography (EEG) signals were acquired at a sampling rate of 128 Hz using BIS-VISTA with standard bispectral index (BIS) sensors. All data were stored on a computer for further analysis. The similarities and difference among spectral entropy, the BIS, and CAI were analyzed. Pearson correlation coefficient between the BIS and CAI was 0.825. The result of fitting the semiparametric regression models is the method CAI estimate (-0.00995; P = .0341). It is the estimated difference in the mean of the dependent variable between method BIS and CAI. The CAI algorithm, a simple and intuitive algorithm based on brain activity signal modeling, suggests an intrinsic relationship between the DoA and the EEG waveform. We suggest that the CAI algorithm might be used to quantify the DoA.","Huh, Hyub; Park, Sang-Hyun; Yu, Joon Ho; Hong, Jisu; Lee, Mee Ju; Cho, Jang Eun; Lim, Choon Hak; Lee, Hye Won; Kim, Jun Beom; Yang, Kyung-Sook; Yoon, Seung Zhoo",Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000018441; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32000357/,8

107702,Call for independent monitoring of disease outbreak preparedness.,2018,"BACKGROUND Gastroparesis is a condition characterized by epigastric symptoms and delayed gastric emptying (GE) rate in the absence of any mechanical obstruction. The condition is challenging in clinical practice by the lack of guidance concerning diagnosis and management of gastroparesis. METHODS A Delphi consensus was undertaken by 40 experts from 19 European countries who conducted a literature summary and voting process on 89 statements. Quality of evidence was evaluated using grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation criteria. Consensus (defined as ≥80% agreement) was reached for 25 statements. RESULTS The European consensus defined gastroparesis as the presence of symptoms associated with delayed GE in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Nausea and vomiting were identified as cardinal symptoms, with often coexisting postprandial distress syndrome symptoms of dyspepsia. The true epidemiology of gastroparesis is not known in detail, but diabetes, gastric surgery, certain neurological and connective tissue diseases, and the use of certain drugs recognized as risk factors. While the panel agreed that severely impaired gastric motor function is present in these patients, there was no consensus on underlying pathophysiology. The panel agreed that an upper endoscopy and a GE test are required for diagnosis. Only dietary therapy, dopamine-2 antagonists and 5-HT4 receptor agonists were considered appropriate therapies, in addition to nutritional support in case of severe weight loss. No consensus was reached on the use of proton pump inhibitors, other classes of antiemetics or prokinetics, neuromodulators, complimentary, psychological, or more invasive therapies. Finally, there was consensus that gastroparesis adversely impacts on quality of life and healthcare costs and that the long-term prognosis of gastroparesis depends on the cause. CONCLUSIONS AND INFERENCES A multinational group of European experts summarized the current state of consensus on definition, symptom characteristics, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of gastroparesis.","Schol, Jolien; Wauters, Lucas; Dickman, Ram; Drug, Vasile; Mulak, Agata; Serra, Jordi; Enck, Paul; Tack, Jan",Neurogastroenterology and motility : the official journal of the European Gastrointestinal Motility Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/nmo.14237; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34399024/,8
108137,Computer simulations of thermal tissue remodeling during transvaginal and transurethral laser treatment of female stress urinary incontinence.,2017,"BACKGROUND Arterial bifurcations are common locations for aneurysm development given the altered hemodynamic forces and shear stress variations present at these locations. Recent reports indicate that a wide basilar artery bifurcation angle is an independent predictor of aneurysm development, growth, and subsequent rupture. METHODS To determine the effect of basilar artery bifurcation angle on rates of initial occlusion, recanalization, and retreatment of basilar artery apex aneurysms following coil embolization, the records of 46 patients with basilar artery apex aneurysms treated with endovascular coil embolization from 2007 to 2013 were analyzed. RESULTS A wide basilar artery bifurcation angle was associated with a Raymond-Roy Occlusion Classification (RROC) III occlusion in univariate analysis, but was not a statistically significant factor in multivariate modeling. An increasing basilar artery bifurcation angle was not associated with aneurysm recanalization or retreatment following coil embolization. Increasing packing density (p < .01) was the only statistically significant predictor of a RROC I or II closure. The initial RROC designation was the most powerful predictor of both eventual aneurysm recanalization (p = .01) and retreatment (p = .02). While increasing aneurysm size (p < .01), increasing aneurysm volume (p < .01), and increasing neck size (p < .01) were associated with wide basilar artery bifurcation angles, neck size (p = .03) was the only statistically significant predictor of basilar artery bifurcation angle on multivariate analyses. CONCLUSION Basilar artery bifurcation angle fails to predict rates of initial occlusion, recanalization, and retreatment on multivariate modeling in our series. Basilar artery apex aneurysm neck size independently correlates with basilar artery bifurcation angle.","Stapleton, Christopher J; Kumar, Jay I; Walcott, Brian P; Torok, Collin M; Agarwalla, Pankaj K; Koch, Matthew J; Patel, Aman B","Interventional neuroradiology : journal of peritherapeutic neuroradiology, surgical procedures and related neurosciences",https://doi.org/10.1177/1591019916633243; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26922975/,8

108413,Self-expanding metallic stent improves histopathologic edema compared with transanal drainage tube for malignant colorectal obstruction.,2016,"BACKGROUND Dissecting aneurysms of the posterior cerebral artery (PCA) are rare and difficult to treat because of their deep and unfamiliar locations and unusual shapes. Although several treatment modalities have been proposed, none have generated satisfying results. Our experiences with PCA-dissecting aneurysms are reviewed and the treatment strategies discussed. METHODS All consecutive patients with PCA-dissecting aneurysm who were treated in a tertiary referral hospital between January 1998 and March 2014 were identified by retrospective review. Their clinical characteristics, radiological findings, treatment modalities and outcomes were documented. RESULTS Of the 21 patients with 21 PCA-dissecting aneurysms, 9 had subarachnoid hemorrhage and 3 had acute infarction of the thalamus at presentation. The aneurysms involved P1 (n = 4), the P1-2 junction (n = 3), mid-P2 (n = 6), P2A (n = 3), P2P (n = 1) and the P2-3 junction (n = 4). The aneurysm shapes were as follows: fusiform (n = 12), partially thrombosed (n = 8) and blood blister-like aneurysms (n = 1). The mean size was 16.6 ± 9.7 mm. Parent artery occlusion (PAO) without bypass (n = 15), PAO with bypass (n = 2), stent-assisted endosaccular coiling (n = 3) and stent placement only (n = 1) were performed. All three patients who underwent stent-assisted endosaccular coiling and the single patient who underwent PAO without bypass developed aneurysm recurrence. Six of the ten patients who received a PAO without a balloon test occlusion (BTO) experienced PCA territory infarction, whereas only one of the five patients who received a PAO after passing the BTO experienced an infarction. CONCLUSIONS PAO for PCA-dissecting aneurysm was effective in preventing recurrence. In addition, BTO before PAO was helpful in identifying candidates who truly needed surgical revascularization.","Park, Wonhyoung; Kwon, Do Hoon; Ahn, Jae Sung; Lee, Sung Ho; Park, Jung Cheol; Kwun, Byung Duk",Acta neurochirurgica,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00701-015-2526-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26259621/,8

LAA was excluded after appendectomy and checked by intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography. The mean follow-up duration was 24.3 ± 3.5 months. No patients showed signs and symptoms of transient ischemic attack or stroke. No new positive findings were demonstrated by recurring brain CT scan performed after the procedure. Cardiac CT confirmed the absence of LAA and thrombosis in the left atrium. 87.8 % (72/82) of all patients were in sinus rhythm. Our results demonstrate that the modified endoscopic procedure is a safe, effective, and appropriate treatment for AF, which restores sinus rhythm and may be associated with the prevention of AF-related stroke.","Ma, Nan; Jiang, Zhaolei; Chen, Fei; Yin, Hang; Ding, Fangbao; Mei, Ju",Heart and vessels,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00380-015-0749-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26391680/,8

The questionnaire covered key themes: socio-demographic characteristics; changes in physical and mental health; accessibility of essential health services and information; and socio-economic concerns. Free-text qualitative responses were examined through framework analysis. Quantitative data from 653 respondents were available, with a subset of 385 free-text qualitative responses. In terms of mental health, 501 (77.6%) respondents reported feeling more anxious; 464 (71.8%) reported feeling more depressed than usual; and 128 (19.8%) reported having suicidal thoughts since the start of the pandemic. Respondents worried about running out of HIV medicine (n = 264, 40.7%); accessing HIV services (n = 246, 38.0%) as well as other health services (n = 408, 63.0%). Widespread resilience was also noted: 537 (83.3%) of respondents felt that living with HIV had equipped them with the strength to adapt to the Covid-19 pandemic. Findings highlight important gaps between the multifaceted needs of PLWH. Multisectoral collaborations and investments are needed to adequately support PLWH and to build resilience to future shocks within HIV services.","Pantelic, Marija; Martin, Kevin; Fitzpatrick, Colin; Nixon, Eileen; Tweed, Marc; Spice, William; Jones, Martin; Darking, Mary; Whetham, Jennifer; Vera, Jaime H",AIDS care,https://doi.org/10.1080/09540121.2021.1975628; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34530649/,8

A systematic literature search was conducted on 30 November 2018 in PubMed and Embase. The search comprised the keywords 'proliferative diabetic retinopathy', 'laser', 'treatment' and 'anti-vegf'. We included prospective studies and randomized controlled trials that investigated certain side-effects (VF, dark adaptation, CV, CS) in treatment of PDR (primary outcome). In total, 1867 articles were screened, and 10 studies were included (2176 eyes of 2086 patients examined in the VF studies and 1360 eyes of 1360 patients examined in the CV and CS studies). Visual fields (VF) were investigated in 10 studies, CV in one study and CS in one study. Treatment modalities included conventional PRP, other modalities of laser treatment and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors. Four studies demonstrated a worse VF impact of PRP than VEGF inhibitors. Seven studies reported of an overall worsening in VF after laser with no differences between different laser approaches. No differences were found in CV or CS. Overall, we found a trend, confirmed in four large studies, towards VEGF inhibitors causing less harm to VF compared to conventional PRP. Whilst VF was generally depressed after laser, it did not differ between different treatment approaches. Furthermore, it was not possible to make certain conclusions of CV or CS, with only one study in each field.","Vergmann, Anna Stage; Grauslund, Jakob",Acta ophthalmologica,https://doi.org/10.1111/aos.14474; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32421255/,8

109519,Effectiveness of surgical masks against influenza bioaerosols.,2013,"Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and other solar components were observed for a period of 3 years at Wuhan, China to determine for the first time the temporal variability of PAR fraction [PAR/G (G here stands for global solar radiation)] and its dependence on different sky conditions in Central China. PAR, G and PAR/G showed similar seasonal features that peaked in summer and reached their lowest values in winter. The seasonal PAR/G ranged from 1.70 E MJ(-1) (winter) to 2.01 E MJ(-1) (summer) with an annual mean value of 1.89 E MJ(-1). Hourly values of PAR/G increased from 1.78 to 2.11 E MJ(-1) on average as sky conditions changed from clear to cloudy. Monthly mean hourly PAR/G revealed a diurnal variation, with highest values observed around sunrise and sunset, slightly higher PAR fractions were also found around noon for most months. The effect of daylength on PAR/G was also studied and no significant impact was found. Three models were developed to estimate PAR from G. These models consisted of atmospheric parameters that were found to cause substantial changes of PAR/G, such as sky clearness, brightness, path length and the sky clearness index. The estimations obtained from different models were very close to the measured values with maximum relative errors below 8 % (hourly values) in Wuhan. The models were not only tested at seven radiation stations in Central China, but also verified in six stations with different climates in China. The models were found to estimate PAR accurately from commonly available G data in Central China; however, the results also implied that the models need to be modified to account for local climatic conditions when applied to the whole country.","Wang, Lunche; Gong, Wei; Ma, Yingying; Hu, Bo; Zhang, Miao",International journal of biometeorology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00484-013-0690-7; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23780493/,8

Inhibitors are used to cease the potency of the efflux pumps. In this study, in-silico models are used to investigate the nature of the binding pocket of the MexAB-OprM efflux pump. First, we have performed Classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to shed light on different aspects of protein-inhibitor interaction in the binding pocket of the pump. Using classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics QM/MM), and various types of analyses, we have shown that D13-9001 has a better binding affinity towards the binding pocket than D1 and D2 which was established experimentally. Two stable configurations of D13-9001 are discovered inside the distal pocket which could be one of the primary reason of the greater efficacy of D13-9001. Free energy barrier upon changing one state to another is calculated by employing umbrella sampling method. Finally, F178 is mutated to have the complete picture as it contributes a significant amount to the binding energy irrespective of the three inhibitors. The results of our study could be potentially used to design a new generation of inhibitors for such an efflux pump.","Patra, Niladri; Roy, Rakesh Kumar",Chemphyschem : a European journal of chemical physics and physical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1002/cphc.202000759; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33079475/,8

Nomenclature for the formyl peptide receptor (FPR) family.,2009,"BACKGROUND The high molecular complexity of variably O-glycosylated and degraded pro B-type natriuretic peptide (proBNP) derived molecular forms challenges current immunoassays. Antibodies used show pronounced differences in cross-reactivities with these circulating fragments, which still need to be better characterized on a molecular level. To pave the way for advanced quantitative assays in the future, it is critical to fully understand these circulating forms. METHODS Plasma samples were collected from 8 heart failure (HF) patients and 2 healthy controls. NT-proBNP and proBNP were purified by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by nano-flow liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. Fragments formed during proteolysis in solution digestion were distinguished from naturally occurring peptides by using an 18O stable isotope labeling strategy. RESULTS We detected 16 previously unknown circulating fragments of proBNP peptides (9 of which are located in the N-terminal and 7 in the C-terminal region), revealing a more advanced state of degradation than previously known. Two of these fragments are indicative of either unidentified processing modes or a far-reaching C-terminal degradation (or a combination thereof) of the precursor proBNP. CONCLUSIONS Our results further restrict ideal target epitopes for immunoassay antibodies and expand the current thinking of diversity, degradation, and processing of proBNP, as well as the distribution of circulating forms.","Amplatz, Benno; Sarg, Bettina; Faserl, Klaus; Hammerer-Lercher, Angelika; Mair, Johannes; Lindner, Herbert H",Clinical chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1093/clinchem/hvaa130; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32797158/,8

Prospective Randomized Study With Two Commercial Negative Pressure Systems.,2020,"The mental health of frontline workers is critical to a community's ability to manage crises and disasters. This study assessed risks for mental health problems (traumatic stress, depression, anxiety, alcohol use, insomnia) in association with pandemic-related stressors in a sample of emergency and hospital personnel (N = 571). Respondents completed self-report surveys online from April 1st to May 7th, 2020 in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States. Results showed that roughly fifteen to thirty percent of respondents screened positive for each disorder. Odds of screening positive were similar between groups for probable acute traumatic stress, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, and alcohol use disorder; emergency personnel reported significantly higher rates of insufficient sleep than healthcare workers. Logistic regressions showed that respondents who reported having an immunocompromised condition had higher odds of acute traumatic stress, anxiety, and depression. Having an immunocompromised household member was associated with higher odds of insufficient sleep and anxiety. Being in a direct care provision role was associated with higher odds of screening positive for risky alcohol use. Being in a management role over direct care providers was associated with higher odds of screening positive for anxiety, risky alcohol use, and insufficient sleep. There was an inverse relationship between number of positive COVID-19 cases and anxiety, such that as positive cases went up, anxiety decreased. Overall, the mental health risks that we observed early in the COVID-19 pandemic are elevated above previous viral outbreaks (SARS) and comparable to rates shown in disasters (9/11 attacks; Hurricane Katrina).","Wright, Hannah M; Griffin, Brandon J; Shoji, Kotaro; Love, Tiffany M; Langenecker, Scott A; Benight, Charles C; Smith, Andrew J",Journal of psychiatric research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2020.10.045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33189356/,8
111509,Patellectomy for osteoarthritis: a new tension preserving surgical technique to reconstruct the extensor mechanism with retrospective review of long-term follow-up.,2015,"High-throughput tissue barrier models can yield critical insights on how barrier function responds to therapeutics, pathogens, and toxins. However, such models often emphasize multiplexing capability at the expense of physiologic relevance. Particularly, the distal lung's air-blood barrier is typically modeled with epithelial cell monoculture, neglecting the substantial contribution of endothelial cell feedback in the coordination of barrier function. An obstacle to establishing high-throughput coculture models relevant to the epithelium/endothelium interface is the requirement for underside cell seeding, which is difficult to miniaturize and automate. Therefore, this paper describes a scalable, low-cost seeding method that eliminates inversion by optimizing medium density to float cells so they attach under the membrane. This method generates a 96-well model of the distal lung epithelium-endothelium barrier with serum-free, glucocorticoid-free air-liquid differentiation. The polarized epithelial-endothelial coculture exhibits mature barrier function, appropriate intercellular junction staining, and epithelial-to-endothelial transmission of inflammatory stimuli such as polyinosine:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)). Further, exposure to influenza A virus PR8 and human beta-coronavirus OC43 initiates a dose-dependent inflammatory response that propagates from the epithelium to endothelium. While this model focuses on the air-blood barrier, the underside seeding method is generalizable to various coculture tissue models for scalable, physiologic screening.","Viola, Hannah; Washington, Kendra; Selva, Cauviya; Grunwell, Jocelyn; Tirouvanziam, Rabindra; Takayama, Shuichi",Advanced healthcare materials,https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202100879; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34174173/,8

A key macronutrient proposed to increase hepatosteatosis and NASH risk is fructose. Excessive intake of fructose causes intestinal-barrier deterioration and endotoxaemia. However, how fructose triggers these alterations and their roles in hepatosteatosis and NASH pathogenesis remain unknown. Here we show, using mice, that microbiota-derived Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists promote hepatosteatosis without affecting fructose-1-phosphate (F1P) and cytosolic acetyl-CoA. Activation of mucosal-regenerative gp130 signalling, administration of the YAP-induced matricellular protein CCN1 or expression of the antimicrobial peptide Reg3b (beta) peptide counteract fructose-induced barrier deterioration, which depends on endoplasmic-reticulum stress and subsequent endotoxaemia. Endotoxin engages TLR4 to trigger TNF production by liver macrophages, thereby inducing lipogenic enzymes that convert F1P and acetyl-CoA to FA in both mouse and human hepatocytes.","Todoric, Jelena; Di Caro, Giuseppe; Reibe, Saskia; Henstridge, Darren C; Green, Courtney R; Vrbanac, Alison; Ceteci, Fatih; Conche, Claire; McNulty, Reginald; Shalapour, Shabnam; Taniguchi, Koji; Meikle, Peter J; Watrous, Jeramie D; Moranchel, Rafael; Najhawan, Mahan; Jain, Mohit; Liu, Xiao; Kisseleva, Tatiana; Diaz-Meco, Maria T; Moscat, Jorge; Knight, Rob; Greten, Florian R; Lau, Lester F; Metallo, Christian M; Febbraio, Mark A; Karin, Michael",Nature metabolism,https://doi.org/10.1038/s42255-020-0261-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839596/,8

ACA+ patients without anti-SS-A/Ro antibodies require salivary gland histopathology to fulfill the ACR/EULAR criteria for diagnosis of SS. We reviewed salivary gland histology among ACA+ patients referred for the diagnosis of SS using the ACR/EULAR and Japanese criteria which does not require biopsy. METHOD Data from 147 ACA+ patients with dry eyes and/or mouth who visited our department were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical, immunological, and histological data were collected and statistically analyzed. RESULT Sixty-five patients (44%) had undergone labial salivary gland biopsy. The frequency of dry mouth was higher in ACA+ patients who had undergone labial salivary gland biopsy than in those who had not (P = .046), while there were no differences in biopsy rates between patients with and without sclerodactyly (P = .51). According to the current ACR/EULAR classification criteria, Greenspan grade of 3 or 4 for labial salivary gland histopathology is required in patients without anti-SS-A/Ro antibody for the diagnosis of SS. Four patients with Greenspan grades <3 and anti-SS-A/Ro antibody met the criteria for SS. In 54 patients in which the ACR/EULAR criteria were met, 53 patients were diagnosed with SS using the Japanese criteria. CONCLUSION In ACA+/anti-SS-A/Ro- antibody patients, agreement between ACR/EULAR and Japanese criteria sets was excellent. For easily classifying ACA+ patients as SS cases, salivary gland biopsy should be performed in ACA+ patients with dry symptoms to identify ACA+ patients.","Tsukamoto, Masako; Suzuki, Katsuya; Tsunoda, Kazuyuki; Ikeura, Kazuhiro; Kameyama, Kaori; Takeuchi, Tsutomu",International journal of rheumatic diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/1756-185x.13895; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32691526/,8
111668,Challenges in the Discovery of Novel Therapeutic Agents for Cancer Treatment (Part IV).,2020,"3D Cell culture is an alternative to animal use in many drug development and toxicity studies. The 3D cell culture can mimic and reproduce the original tissue microenvironment, morphology, and mechanical and physiological characteristics, to provide a more realistic and reliable response as compared to two-dimensional cultures. 3D cell culture encapsulated in alginate beads is a very simple and relatively inexpensive tool that is easy to handle and to maintain. The alginate beads function as a scaffold that imprisons cells and allows 3D cell growth, to generate spheroids that can have greater genic expression and cell-cell communication as a nano or microtissue. The HepG2 cell line is a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell derivative. HepG2 cells preserve several of the characteristics of hepatocytes and are therefore often used in toxicity studies. Here, we describe HepG2 cell encapsulation in alginate beads and analyze the resulting spheroids formed within the alginate beads by immunocytochemistry, by staining a certain structure with a specific antibody coupled with a fluorophore. This method preserves the beads and enables cell analysis by confocal microscopy.","Miranda, Raul Ghiraldelli; Ferraz, Elisa Raquel Anastácio; Pereira, Lilian Cristina; Dorta, Daniel Junqueira",Methods in molecular biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-0716-1091-6_14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423235/,8

METHODS This study is a clinical, randomized, prospective trial. Patients operated on with bilateral mastectomy and immediate breast reconstruction were randomized to biological mesh on one side and synthetic mesh on the other side. RESULTS A total of 48 breasts were randomized. As the synthetically and the biologically reconstructed breasts that were compared belonged to the same woman, systemic factors were exactly the same in the two groups. The most common complication was seroma formation with a frequency of 38% in the biological group and 3.8% in the synthetical group (p = .011). A higher frequency of total implant loss could be seen in the biologic mesh group (8.5% vs. 2%), albeit not statistically significant (p = .083).

Potentially serious iatrogenic complications may occur following VHR, though these are rare compared to the vast number of procedures performed each year. This paper provides an overview of contemporary open and laparoscopic surgical techniques and biomaterials, then reviews and illustrates the expected postoperative imaging appearances, and common and unusual early complications after VHR. Emphasis is placed on multidetector computed tomography (CT), which comprehensively visualizes the operated anterior abdominal wall and deeper intra-abdominal structures. CT consistently allows diagnosis of postoperative seromas, abdominal wall abscesses and fistulas, haemorrhages with or without active bleeding, bowel obstruction, peritonitis and recurrent hernias, and thus providing a reliable basis for an appropriate choice between conservative, interventional, or surgical treatment. Familiarity with early post-surgical CT is warranted to avoid misinterpretation of the expected imaging appearance and correctly elucidate postoperative complications after VHR. TEACHING POINTS • Open and laparoscopic repair of ventral hernias rely on prosthetic mesh implantation. • Potentially serious iatrogenic complications occasionally occur after ventral hernioplasty. • Multidetector CT consistently evaluates the operated abdominal wall and deeper structures. • Familiarity with the expected early postoperative imaging appearance is required. • Complications include seroma, infections, haemorrhage, bowel obstruction, peritonitis, and recurrence.","Tonolini, Massimo; Ippolito, Sonia",Insights into imaging,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13244-016-0501-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27193529/,8

This study investigated the outcomes of thrombectomy performed 6-24 h after stroke onset caused by extracranial ICA occlusion. Of 586 stroke patients receiving thrombectomy during the past 3 years and registered in the Tama Registry of Acute Endovascular Thrombectomy database, 24 were identified with ICA occlusion (14 extracranial and 10 intracranial), known to be well 6-24 h before presentation, and with pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0 or 1. Clinical outcomes measured were the rate of functional independence at 90 days according to mRS score of 0-2 and 90 day mortality rate. Of patients with extracranial ICA occlusion, two received additional carotid stenting with thrombectomy. The median interval between the last time the patient was known to be well and hospital arrival was 601 (interquartile range, 476-729 min). Both the rate of functional independence at 90 days and 90 day mortality were comparable between patients with extracranial or intracranial ICA occlusion (36% vs. 40% and 7% vs. 10%, respectively). No symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages occurred within 24 h following treatment of extracranial ICA occlusion.

113542,Cannabis Extract CT-921 Has a High Efficacy-Adverse Effect Profile in a Neuropathic Pain Model.,2020,"Integrins regulate mechanotransduction between smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and the extracellular matrix (ECM). SMCs resident in the walls of airways or blood vessels are continuously exposed to dynamic mechanical forces due to breathing or pulsatile blood flow. However, the resulting effects of these forces on integrin dynamics and associated cell-matrix adhesion are not well understood. Here we present experimental results from atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments, designed to study the integrin response to external oscillatory loading of varying amplitudes applied to live aortic SMCs, together with theoretical results from a mathematical model. In the AFM experiments, a fibronectin-coated probe was used cyclically to indent and retract from the surface of the cell. We observed a transition between states of firm adhesion and of complete detachment as the amplitude of oscillatory loading increased, revealed by qualitative changes in the force timecourses. Interestingly, for some of the SMCs in the experiments, switching behaviour between the two adhesion states is observed during single timecourses at intermediate amplitudes. We obtain two qualitatively similar adhesion states in the mathematical model, where we simulate the cell, integrins and ECM as an evolving system of springs, incorporating local integrin binding dynamics. In the mathematical model, we observe a region of bistability where both the firm adhesion and detachment states can occur depending on the initial adhesion state. The differences are seen to be a result of mechanical cooperativity of integrins and cell deformation. Switching behaviour is a phenomenon associated with bistability in a stochastic system, and bistability in our deterministic mathematical model provides a potential physical explanation for the experimental results. Physiologically, bistability provides a means for transient mechanical stimuli to induce long-term changes in adhesion dynamics-and thereby the cells' ability to transmit force-and we propose further experiments for testing this hypothesis.","Irons, Linda; Huang, Huang; Owen, Markus R; O'Dea, Reuben D; Meininger, Gerald A; Brook, Bindi S",Journal of theoretical biology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtbi.2020.110387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32603668/,8

The study site was the State of São Paulo, Brazil, where the first case of the disease was confirmed. We applied the Kernel Density to generate surfaces that indicate where there is higher density of cases and, consequently, greater risk of confirming new cases. The spatial pattern of COVID-19 pandemic could be observed in São Paulo State, in which its metropolitan region standed out with the greatest cases, being classified as a hotspot. In addition, the main highways and airports that connect the capital to the cities with the highest population density were classified as medium density areas by the Kernel Density method.It indicates a gradual expansion from the capital to the interior.

We aimed to forecast mortality trends in the 27 countries of the European Union (EU), plus Switzerland and the United Kingdom (UK), where lockdown dates and confinement interventions have been heterogeneous, and to explore its determinants. METHODS We have adapted our predictive model of COVID-19-related mortality, which rested on the observed mortality within the first weeks of the outbreak and the date of the respective lockdown in each country. It was applied in a training set of three countries (Italy, Germany and Spain), and then applied to the EU plus the UK and Switzerland. In addition, we explored the effects of timeliness and rigidity of the lockdown (on a five-step scale) and population density in our forecasts. We report r2, and percent variation of expected versus observed deaths, all following TRIPOD guidance. RESULTS We identified a homogeneous distribution of deaths, and found a median of 24 days after lockdown adoption to reach the maximum daily deaths. Strikingly, cumulative deaths up to April 25th, 2020 observed in Europe separated countries in three waves, according to the time lockdown measures were adopted following the onset of the outbreak: after a week, within a week, or even prior to the outbreak (r2=0.876). In contrast, no correlation neither with lockdown rigidity nor population density were observed. CONCLUSIONS The European experience confirms that early, effective interventions of 86 lockdown are fundamental to minimizing the COVID-19 death toll.","Gerli, Alberto G; Centanni, Stefano; Miozzo, Monica R; Virchow, J Christian; Sotgiu, Giovanni; Canonica, G Walter; Soriano, Joan B",Minerva medica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0026-4806.20.06702-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32491297/,8

This report describes the residual symptom domains and individual depressive symptoms in a large representative sample of outpatients with nonpsychotic MDD who responded without remitting after up to 12 weeks of citalopram treatment in the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) study. Response was defined as 50% or greater reduction in baseline 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology--Self-Report (QIDS-SR₁₆) by treatment exit, and remission as a final QIDS-SR₁₆ of less than 6. Residual symptom domains and individual symptoms were based on the QIDS-SR₁₆ and classified as either persisting from baseline or emerging during treatment. Most responders who did not remit endorsed approximately 5 residual symptom domains and 6 to 7 residual depressive symptoms. The most common domains were insomnia (94.6%), sad mood (70.8%), and decreased concentration (69.6%). The most common individual symptoms were midnocturnal insomnia (79.0%), sad mood (70.8%), and decreased concentration/decision making (69.6%). The most common treatment-emergent symptoms were midnocturnal insomnia (51.4%) and decreased general interest (40.0%). The most common persistent symptoms were midnocturnal insomnia (81.6%), sad mood (70.8%), and decreased concentration/decision making (70.6%). Suicidal ideation was the least common treatment-emergent symptom (0.7%) and the least common persistent residual symptom (17.1%).

114619,"A novel ruthenium(II) gallic acid complex disrupts the actin cytoskeleton and inhibits migration, invasion and adhesion of triple negative breast tumor cells.",2020-12-11,"Intraocular pressure (IOP) is the most important risk factor for glaucoma development and progression. Most anti-glaucoma treatments aim to lower IOP by enhancing aqueous humor drainage from the eye. Aqueous humor drainage occurs via well-characterized trabecular meshwork (TM) and uveoscleral (UVS) pathways, and recently described ciliary body lymphatics. The relative contribution of the lymphatic pathway to aqueous drainage is not known. We developed a sheep model to quantitatively assess lymphatic drainage along with TM and UVS outflows. This study describes that model and presents our initial findings. Following intracameral injection of (125)I-bovine serum albumin (BSA), lymph was continuously collected via cannulated cervical lymphatic vessels and the thoracic lymphatic duct over either a 3-h or 5-h time period. In the same animals, blood samples were collected from the right jugular vein every 15 min. Lymphatic and TM drainage were quantitatively assessed by measuring (125)I-BSA in lymph and plasma, respectively. Radioactive tracer levels were also measured in UVS and ""other"" ocular tissue, as well as periocular tissue harvested 3 and 5 h post-injection. Tracer recovered from UVS tissue was used to estimate UVS drainage. The amount of (125)I-BSA recovered from different fluid and tissue compartments was expressed as a percentage of total recovered tracer. Three hours after tracer injection, percentage of tracer recovered in lymph and plasma was 1.64% ± 0.89% and 68.86% ± 9.27%, respectively (n = 8). The percentage of tracer in UVS, other ocular and periocular tissues was 19.87% ± 5.59%, 4.30% ± 3.31% and 5.32% ± 2.46%, respectively. At 5 h (n = 2), lymphatic drainage was increased (6.40% and 4.96% vs. 1.64%). On the other hand, the percentage of tracer recovered from UVS and other ocular tissue had decreased, and the percentage from periocular tissue showed no change. Lymphatic drainage increased steadily over the 3 h post-injection period, while TM drainage increased rapidly - reaching a plateau at 30 min. This quantitative sheep model enables assessment of relative contributions of lymphatic drainage, TM and UVS outflows, and may help to better understand the effects of glaucoma agents on outflow pathways.","Kim, Minhui; Johnston, Miles G; Gupta, Neeru; Moore, Sara; Yücel, Yeni H",Experimental eye research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.exer.2011.07.006; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21810424/,8

A critical review of the literature 1977-2014.,2015,"BACKGROUND Revascularization of stenotic cerebral arteries is hypothesized to improve cognition by increasing cerebral perfusion. AIMS We compared cognition impairment among patients treated with percutaneous angioplasty and stenting (PTAS) and aggressive medical management (AMM) versus AMM alone in the Stenting versus Aggressive Medical Therapy for Intracranial Arterial Stenosis (SAMMPRIS) Trial. METHODS In SAMMPRIS, 451 patients with recent transient ischemic attack or stroke attributed to 70-99% intracranial stenosis were randomized to PTAS plus AMM or AMM alone. Patients who had stroke as the qualifying event with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale indicating aphasia or neglect were excluded from these analyses. Patients with a cerebrovascular event (ischemic stroke, cerebral infarct with temporary signs or intracranial hemorrhage) during follow-up were excluded from follow-up visit analyses. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score was used to assess cognition impairment at baseline, 4 months, 12 months and closeout. Cognitive impairment was defined as MoCA <26. Mean MoCA scores and the percentage of patients with cognitive impairment were compared between treatment groups at each time point using t tests and chi-square tests. Differences in MoCA mean at baseline and follow-up time points were compared using mixed model repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer tests. RESULTS There were no significant differences between the treatment groups for mean MoCA at any time point. Mean MoCA scores improved in both groups. The percentage of patients with cognitive impairment in the AMM versus PTAS groups was not significantly different at any time point. CONCLUSIONS Revascularization with PTAS showed no improvement in cognitive impairment over AMM alone among patients who did not have recurrent cerebrovascular events during follow-up.","Turan, Tanya N; Smock, Alison; Cotsonis, George; Bachman, David; Al Kasab, Sami; Lynn, Michael J; Nizham, Azhar; Derdeyn, Collin P; Fiorella, David; Janis, Scott; Lane, Bethany; Montgomery, Jean; Chimowitz, Marc I",Cerebrovascular diseases,https://doi.org/10.1159/000450964; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27820930/,8

The purpose of this substudy of the B-Unaware and BAG-RECALL trials was to assess whether a BIS-based anesthetic protocol was superior to an end-tidal anesthetic concentration-based protocol in decreasing recovery time and postoperative complications. METHODS Patients at high risk for awareness were randomized to either BIS-guided or end-tidal anesthetic concentration-guided general anesthesia in the original trials. Outcomes included time to postanesthesia care unit discharge readiness, time to achieve a postoperative Aldrete score of 9-10, intensive care unit length of stay, postoperative nausea and vomiting, and severe postoperative pain. Univariate Cox regression and chi-square tests were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS The BIS cohort was not superior in time to postanesthesia care unit discharge readiness (hazard ratio, 1.0; 95% CI, 1.0-1.1; n = 2,949), time to achieve an Aldrete score of 9-10 (hazard ratio, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.4; n = 706), intensive care unit length of stay (hazard ratio, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.9-1.1; n = 2,074), incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting (absolute risk reduction, -0.5%; 95% CI, -5.8 to 4.8%; n = 789), or incidence of severe postoperative pain (absolute risk reduction, 4.4%; 95% CI, -2.3 to 11.1%; n = 759). CONCLUSIONS In patients at high risk for awareness, the BIS-guided protocol is not superior to an anesthetic concentration-guided protocol in time needed for postoperative recovery or in the incidences of common postoperative complications.","Fritz, Bradley A; Rao, Preetika; Mashour, George A; Abdallah, Arbi Ben; Burnside, Beth A; Jacobsohn, Eric; Zhang, Lini; Avidan, Michael S",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0b013e31828604ab; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23353791/,8
115247,Surveillance of respiratory viruses among children attending a primary school in rural coastal Kenya.,2020,"OBJECTIVES Good social connection is associated with better health and wellbeing. However, social connection has distinct considerations for people living in long-term care (LTC) homes. The objective of this scoping review was to summarize research literature linking social connection to mental health outcomes, specifically among LTC residents, as well as research to identify strategies to help build and maintain social connection in this population during COVID-19. DESIGN Scoping review. SETTINGS AND PARTICIPANTS Residents of LTC homes, care homes, and nursing homes. METHODS We searched MEDLINE(R) ALL (Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO (Ovid), Scopus, Sociological Abstracts (ProQuest), Embase and Embase Classic (Ovid), Emcare Nursing (Ovid), and AgeLine (EBSCO) for research that quantified an aspect of social connection among LTC residents; we limited searches to English-language articles published from database inception to search date (July 2019). For the current analysis, we included studies that reported (1) the association between social connection and a mental health outcome, (2) the association between a modifiable risk factor and social connection, or (3) intervention studies with social connection as an outcome. From studies in (2) and (3), we identified strategies that could be implemented and adapted by LTC residents, families and staff during COVID-19 and included the articles that informed these strategies. RESULTS We included 133 studies in our review. We found 61 studies that tested the association between social connection and a mental health outcome. We highlighted 12 strategies, informed by 72 observational and intervention studies, that might help LTC residents, families, and staff build and maintain social connection for LTC residents. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Published research conducted among LTC residents has linked good social connection to better mental health outcomes. Observational and intervention studies provide some evidence on approaches to address social connection in this population. Although further research is needed, it does not obviate the need to act given the sudden and severe impact of COVID-19 on social connection in LTC residents.","Bethell, Jennifer; Aelick, Katelynn; Babineau, Jessica; Bretzlaff, Monica; Edwards, Cathleen; Gibson, Josie-Lee; Colborne, Debbie Hewitt; Iaboni, Andrea; Lender, Dee; Schon, Denise; McGilton, Katherine",Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2020.11.025; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33347846/,8

Recent reports show that the virus affects the central nervous system (CNS) with symptoms and complications that include dizziness, altered consciousness, encephalitis, and even stroke. These can immerge as indirect immune effects due to increased cytokine production or via direct viral entry into brain tissue. The latter is possible through neuronal access via the olfactory bulb, hematogenous access through immune cells or directly across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), and through the brain's circumventricular organs characterized by their extensive and highly permeable capillaries. Last, the COVID-19 pandemic increases stress, depression, and anxiety within infected individuals, those in isolation, and high-risk populations like children, the elderly, and health workers.

115427,Pulmonary Flow as an Improved Method for Determining Cardiac Output in Mice after Myocardial Infarction.,2017,"BACKGROUND Aerosol generating medical procedures (AGMPs) are common during newborn resuscitation. Neonates with respiratory viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may pose a risk to healthcare workers. International guidelines differ on methods to minimize the risk due to limited data. OBJECTIVE We examined the expiratory airflow dispersion during common neonatal resuscitation AGMPs using infant simulators. METHODS Expiratory airflow dispersion in term and preterm manikins was simulated (n = 288) using fine particle smoke at tidal volumes of 5 ml/kg. Using ImageJ, we quantified dispersion during common airway procedures including endotracheal tube (ETT) and T-piece ventilation. RESULTS Maximal expiratory dispersion distances for the unsupported airway and disconnected uncuffed ETT scenarios were 30.2 and 22.7 cm (term); 22.1 and 17.2 cm (preterm), respectively. Applying T-piece positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) via an ETT (ETTPEEP ) generated no expiratory dispersion but increased tube leak during term simulation, while ventilation breaths (ETTVENT ) caused significant expiratory dispersion and leak. There was no measurable dispersion during face mask ventilation. For term uncuffed ETT ventilation, the particle filter eliminated expiratory dispersion but increased leak. No expiratory dispersion and negligible leak were observed when combining a cuffed ETT and filter. Angulated T-pieces generated the greatest median dispersion distances of 35.8 cm (ETTPEEP ) and 23.3 cm (ETTVENT ). CONCLUSIONS Airflow dispersion during neonatal AGMPs is greater than previously postulated and potentially could contaminate healthcare providers during resuscitation of infants infected with contagious viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. It is possible to mitigate this risk using particle filters and cuffed ETTs. Applicability in the clinical setting requires further evaluation.","Kwok, T'ng Chang; Swaby, Rabbi; Sharkey, Don",Pediatric pulmonology,https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.25378; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33826802/,8

We investigated if or how these two swine enteric coronaviruses interact with each other in gnotobiotic (Gn) piglets. Seventeen 9-10-day-old Gn piglets were randomly assigned to 5 groups and inoculated with PEDV strain PC21A [9.3 log10 genomic equivalents (GE)/pig] and/or PDCoV strain OH-FD22 (8.6 log10 GE/pig) as follows: dually with PEDV and PDCoV [16 h later (n = 4) or simultaneously (n = 3)] or singly with PEDV (n = 4), PDCoV (n = 4), or mock (n = 3). No enhanced clinical disease or fecal PEDV shedding were observed in dually inoculated pigs compared with PEDV or PDCoV singly inoculated pigs, coinciding with no significant differences in jejunal VH:CD ratios and PEDV antigen-positive scores at post-inoculation days (PIDs) 3-4 among the groups. These observations indicate no increased severity of PEDV infectivity by PDCoV co-infection. Notably, compared with PDCoV singly inoculated pigs, low to moderate fecal PDCoV RNA titers were detected only at PID 1 in both dually inoculated pig groups. At PIDs 2-4, however, there was no detectable PDCoV RNA in the feces, coinciding with no or few PDCoV antigen-positive cells in the small and large intestine of the dually inoculated pigs at PIDs 3-4. These observations indicate a possible interference or inhibition of PDCoV replication in the gastrointestinal tract of pigs co-infected with PEDV and may influence PDCoV infection in PEDV co-infected pigs.","Jung, Kwonil; Saif, Linda J",Veterinary microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vetmic.2021.109206; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34411994/,8

115788,Authors' Response.,2017,"Background Tumour heterogeneity is considered an important mechanism of treatment failure. Imaging-based assessment of tumour heterogeneity is showing promise but the relationship between these mathematically derived measures and accepted 'gold standards' of tumour biology such as immunohistochemical measures is not established. Methods A total of 20 women with primary breast cancer underwent a research dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography prior to treatment with data being available for 15 of these. Texture analysis was performed of the primary tumours to extract 13 locoregional and global parameters. Immunohistochemical analysis associations were assessed by the Spearman rank correlation. Results Hypoxia-inducible factor-1α was correlated with first-order kurtosis (r = -0.533, P = .041) and higher order neighbourhood grey-tone difference matrix coarseness (r = 0.54, P = .038). Vascular maturity-related smooth muscle actin was correlated with higher order grey-level run-length long-run emphasis (r = -0.52, P = .047), fractal dimension (r = 0.613, P = .015), and lacunarity (r = -0.634, P = .011). Micro-vessel density, reflecting angiogenesis, was also associated with lacunarity (r = 0.547, P = .035).

Studies have indicated increased risk of neurodevelopmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders, dyslexia and ADHD. However, the overall long-term cognitive development of children born to women with SLE has scarcely been examined. In this study, we compare test scores from the Danish National School Tests of children born to women SLE with children of the background population. METHODS We included all singleton children born in Denmark between 1995 and 2008, who were listed in the Danish National School Test Register (n=738,862). Children born to women with SLE were identified through linkage of national healthcare registers. We assessed the children's performance in the national school tests between 2nd and 8th grade, in reading and mathematics. Information on the mothers' redeemed prescriptions in pregnancy was included in stratified analyses. Differences of mean test scores were derived from linear regressions and compared according to maternal SLE status, and predefined categories of medication exposures. RESULTS In total, 312 (0.04%) children were born to mothers with SLE. There were no differences in performance in neither reading nor mathematics tests between those born to mothers with SLE and children born to mothers without SLE. When stratifying on medication exposures among children whose mothers had SLE, there was a non-significant tendency towards poorer results among those exposed to hydroxychloroquine and/or immunosuppressants (n=31), compared to those not exposed to these medications. A similar tendency was not observed among children whose mothers received hydroxychloroquine for non-SLE reasons (n=1,235). CONCLUSION This study indicates no major harmful effect on the child's neurocognitive development from exposure in utero to SLE, hydroxychloroquine and/or immunosuppressants, as measured by school performance.","Knudsen, Signe S; Simard, Julia F; Knudsen, Jakob S; Christensen, Jakob; Laursen, Thomas M; Deleuran, Bent W; Bech, Bodil H",Lupus,https://doi.org/10.1177/0961203320973076; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33197369/,8
115913,Glycyrrhizin as a Potential Treatment for the Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19).,2021-02-10,"Insular epilepsy is increasingly recognized in epilepsy surgery centers. Recent studies suggest that resection of an epileptogenic zone that involves the insula as a treatment for drug-resistant seizures is associated with good outcomes in terms of seizure control. However, despite the existing evidence of a role of the insula in emotions and affective information processing, the long-term psychological outcome of patients undergoing these surgeries remain poorly documented. A group of 27 adults (18 women) who underwent an insulo-opercular resection (in combination with a part of the temporal lobe in 10, and of the frontal lobe in 5) as part of epilepsy surgery at our center between 2004 and 2019 completed psychometric questionnaires to assess depression (Beck Depression Inventory - 2nd edition; BDI-II), anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Trait Version; STAI-T), and quality of life (Patient Weighted Quality of Life In Epilepsy; QOLIE-10-P). Scores were compared to those of patients who had standard temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) surgery with similar socio-demographic and disease characteristics. Seizure control after insular epilepsy surgery was comparable to that observed after TLE surgery, with a majority of patients reporting being seizure free (insular: 63.0%; temporal: 63.2%) or having rare disabling seizures (insular: 7.4%; temporal: 18.4%) at the time of questionnaire completion. Statistical comparisons revealed no significant group difference on scores of depression, anxiety, or quality of life. Hemisphere or extent of insular resection had no significant effect on the studied variables. In the total sample, employment status and seizure control, but not location of surgery, significantly predicted quality of life. Self-reported long-term psychological status after insulo-opercular resection as part of epilepsy surgery thus appears to be similar to that observed after TLE surgery, which is commonly performed in epilepsy surgery centers.","Gravel, Victoria; Boucher, Olivier; Citherlet, Daphné; Hébert-Seropian, Benjamin; Bouthillier, Alain; Nguyen, Dang Khoa",Epilepsy & behavior : E&B,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2021.107919; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33770610/,8

The first published serologic detections of morbillivirus in sea otters occurred in 2001-02 in live-captured Washington sea otters, with a documented 80% seroprevalence. We conducted a retrospective study of sea otter cases from 1989 to 2010 compiled at the US Geological Survey, National Wildlife Health Center to identify cases of morbilliviral disease in Washington sea otters and to characterize the disease using immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, genetic sequencing, virus isolation, and serology. We identified six cases of morbilliviral disease and 12 cases of morbilliviral infection in this population of sea otters during 2000-10. Significant histologic findings included inflammation in the white and gray matter of the brain characterized by lymphoplasmacytic perivascular cuffing, neuronal necrosis, and satellitosis in gray matter and by spongiosis, myelin degeneration, spheroids, and gemistocytes in white matter. Intranuclear and intracytoplasmic viral inclusion bodies were found in neurons, Purkinje cells, and glia. Immunohistochemistry for canine distemper virus (CDV) showed positive staining in neurons, glial cells, and cell processes. A pan-morbillivirus RT-PCR with subsequent restriction endonuclease digestion or sequencing identified CDV. Virus isolation was not successful. Two sea otters with morbilliviral encephalitis showed greater antibody titers to CDV than phocine distemper virus. Histologic changes were confined to the central nervous system and resembled neurologic canine distemper in domestic dogs. Cases of sea otters with morbilliviral infection without histologic changes could represent early infections or incompletely cleared sublethal infections. We found that morbillivirus was present in the Washington sea otter population as early as 2000, and we provide a description of the pathology of canine distemper in sea otters.","Thomas, Nancy; White, C LeAnn; Saliki, Jeremiah; Schuler, Krysten; Lynch, Deanna; Nielsen, Ole; Dubey, J P; Knowles, Susan",Journal of wildlife diseases,https://doi.org/10.7589/jwd-d-19-00008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609600/,8

This innovation represents a relatively new approach to wound management by delivering a unique allograft of live human cells in a nonimmunogenic structural tissue matrix. Developed to fill soft tissue defects and bone voids and to convey antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory capabilities, granulized amniotic membrane and amniotic fluid does not require fetal death, because its procurement is performed with maternal consent during birth. In the present investigation, 20 chronic wounds (20 patients) that had been treated with standard wound therapy for a mean of 36.6 ± 31.58 weeks and with a mean baseline area of 10.15 ± 19.54 cm(2) were followed up during a 12-week observation period or until they healed. A total of 18 of the wounds (90%) healed during the 12-week observation period, and none of the wounds progressed to amputation. From our experience with the patients in the present case series, we believe that granulized amniotic membrane and amniotic fluid represents a useful option for the treatment of chronic diabetic foot wounds.","Werber, Bruce; Martin, Erin",The Journal of foot and ankle surgery : official publication of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1053/j.jfas.2013.03.024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23651696/,8
116678,Association of arsenic-induced cardiovascular disease susceptibility with genetic polymorphisms.,2021-03-18,"Rostral laryngeal advancement, also known as laryngeal tie-forward, is used to treat horses for intermittent dorsal displacement of the soft palate and has a morbidity rate of about 6%. We hypothesized that a novel laryngeal clamp would prevent morbidity associated with the sutures tearing through the thyroid cartilage. Larynges (n = 35 horses) were used for ex vivo testing. For uniaxial testing, 15 equine larynges were tested in one of three laryngeal tie-forward constructs [standard laryngeal tie-forward; modified laryngeal tie-forward using a suture-button; and modified laryngeal tie-forward using a laryngeal clamp]. For biaxial testing, 20 larynges were tested in one of two treatment groups: laryngeal tie-forward and laryngeal tie-forward using a laryngeal clamp. Constructs were tested in single cycle-to-failure. Statistical analyses were performed using ANOVA for uniaxial testing and t-tests for biaxial testing. The laryngeal tie-forward using a laryngeal clamp construct was superior to laryngeal tie-forward and laryngeal tie-forward using a suture-button constructs in resistance to pullout in uniaxial testing. The laryngeal tie-forward using a laryngeal clamp presented a significantly different method of failure than the standard laryngeal tie-forward in the biaxial testing. Failure modes for each construct were primarily by suture failure at the clamp (laryngeal tie-forward using a laryngeal clamp), suture pullout through the thyroid cartilage, or, less commonly, tearing of the cricothyroid ligament (laryngeal tie-forward). In uniaxial testing, the laryngeal tie-forward using a laryngeal clamp failed most commonly due to tearing of the cricothyroid ligament, whereas the standard laryngeal tie-forward and the laryngeal tie-forward using a suture-button failed due to the tearing of the cartilage. The laryngeal clamps provided greater stiffness, load at yield, and tensile stress at yield than did the standard construct. Laryngeal clamps may offer an alternative to standard methods of anchoring the thyroid cartilage when performing the laryngeal tie-forward procedure. Further testing and clinical trials are needed to elucidate the utility of the laryngeal tie-forward using a laryngeal clamp.","Grzeskowiak, Remigiusz M; Schumacher, James; Mulon, Pierre-Yves; Steiner, Richard C; Cassone, Lynne; Anderson, David E",Frontiers in veterinary science,https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.00139; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226795/,8

Although ISGs mediate a protective state against many pathogens, the antiviral functions of the majority of these genes have not been identified. IFITM3 is a small transmembrane ISG that restricts a broad range of viruses, including orthomyxoviruses, flaviviruses, filoviruses, and coronaviruses. Here, we show that alphavirus infection is increased in Ifitm3(-/-) and Ifitm locus deletion (Ifitm-del) fibroblasts and, reciprocally, reduced in fibroblasts transcomplemented with Ifitm3. Mechanistic studies showed that Ifitm3 did not affect viral binding or entry but inhibited pH-dependent fusion. In a murine model of chikungunya virus arthritis, Ifitm3(-/-) mice sustained greater joint swelling in the ipsilateral ankle at days 3 and 7 postinfection, and this correlated with higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and viral burden. Flow cytometric analysis suggested that Ifitm3(-/-) macrophages from the spleen were infected at greater levels than observed in wild-type (WT) mice, results that were supported by experiments with Ifitm3(-/-) bone marrow-derived macrophages. Ifitm3(-/-) mice also were more susceptible than WT mice to lethal alphavirus infection with Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, and this was associated with greater viral burden in multiple organs. Collectively, our data define an antiviral role for Ifitm3 in restricting infection of multiple alphaviruses. IMPORTANCE The interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (IFITM3) inhibits infection of multiple families of viruses in cell culture. Compared to other viruses, much less is known about the antiviral effect of IFITM3 on alphaviruses. In this study, we characterized the antiviral activity of mouse Ifitm3 against arthritogenic and encephalitic alphaviruses using cells and animals with a targeted gene deletion of Ifitm3 as well as deficient cells transcomplemented with Ifitm3. Based on extensive virological analysis, we demonstrate greater levels of alphavirus infection and disease pathogenesis when Ifitm3 expression is absent. Our data establish an inhibitory role for Ifitm3 in controlling infection of alphaviruses.","Poddar, Subhajit; Hyde, Jennifer L; Gorman, Matthew J; Farzan, Michael; Diamond, Michael S",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00655-16; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27440901/,8
116843,A simplified score to quantify comorbidity in COPD.,2014,"Four canine coronavirus type II (CCoV-II) strains were identified in the guts and internal organs of pups which had died of acute gastroenteritis. The CCoV-II strains were strictly related to porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) in the N-terminal domain of the spike protein, whereas in the other parts of the genome, a higher genetic relatedness to recent CCoV-II isolates was observed. Experimental infection of dogs with a TGEV-like isolate induced mild gastroenteritis without any systemic involvement. By virus neutralization tests, antigenic differences between reference and TGEV-like CCoVs were found. Our data support the potential recombinant origin of the TGEV-like CCoVs.","Decaro, Nicola; Mari, Viviana; Campolo, Marco; Lorusso, Alessio; Camero, Michele; Elia, Gabriella; Martella, Vito; Cordioli, Paolo; Enjuanes, Luis; Buonavoglia, Canio",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01937-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19036814/,8

118639,Nurses' preparedness for infectious disease outbreaks: A literature review and narrative synthesis of qualitative evidence.,2018,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus may result from insulin resistance in skeletal muscle. Prokineticin receptor 1 (Prokr1) improves metabolic phenotype in adipose tissue and the cardiovascular system; however, its effects on skeletal muscle have not been investigated. We investigated the Prokr1 signaling pathways and its metabolic function in murine myoblast, satellite cells, and their differentiated myotubes. We measured the expression levels of Prokr1 in the skeletal muscle of mice as well as human skeletal muscle cell-derived myotubes. Prokineticin 2 (PROK2), a ligand of PROKR1, induced calcium mobilization in a dose-dependent manner and altered the mRNA levels of 578 genes in PROKR1-overexpressed HEK293T cells. Functional enrichment of differentially expressed genes revealed that PROKR1 activated Gq-mediated PI3K/AKT and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways in skeletal muscle cells. Prokr1 significantly activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in myotubes derived from C2C12 and satellite cells, regardless of the presence or absence of insulin. Prokr1 also promoted the translocation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) into the plasma membrane. In palmitate-induced insulin-resistant myotubes, Prokr1 enhanced insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation, GLUT4 translocation, and glucose uptake. mRNA and protein levels of Prokr1 were significantly decreased in skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue of diet-induced obese mice, and the amount of PROKR1 protein was significantly decreased in human skeletal muscle cell-derived myotubes under insulin resistance conditions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Prokr1 plays an important role in insulin sensitivity and is a potential therapeutic target to ameliorate insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.","Mok, Jongsoo; Park, Tae Sub; Kim, Sunhong; Kim, Daehoon; Choi, Cheol Soo; Park, Joonghoon",FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology,https://doi.org/10.1096/fj.202001641r; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33184929/,8
118772,Failing the Test - The Tragic Data Gap Undermining the U.S. Pandemic Response.,2020-05-15,"OBJECTIVES A pre-equipped metal trocar is required to use as a camera trocar due to a specification change in the da Vinci X/Xi system (Intuitive Surgical). We observed slight slippage of a trocar placed by the open method. With optical trocar access (OTA), the initial trocar is viewed directly with a laparoscope during placement. Reports regarding OTA for robotic surgery are limited, particularly for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). We modified the OTA procedure such that it was appropriate for RARP. PATIENTS AND METHODS A total of 158 patients were enrolled in this study. The first trocar placement time (FTPT) was compared between the open and OTA groups. In the OTA group, the trocar was mainly placed through the upper abdominal quadrant. We also analyzed the differences between the conventional and modified OTA procedures using the Kii Fios First Entry trocar (Applied Medical). We examined the factors affecting the FTPT using linear regression models. A P value <.05 was considered significant. RESULTS The FTPT was significantly shorter in the OTA group than the open group (P < .0001). The modified method was associated with a shorter FTPT (P = .0001). None of the patient characteristics affected the FTPT in either group. No major complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS OTA was applied successfully during RARP. Use of the Kii Fios First Entry trocar with upper abdominal quadrant placement was suitable for RARP.","Shimbo, Masaki; Endo, Fumiyasu; Tominaga, Koki; Sano, Masayuki; Nishino, Takato; Kyono, Yoko; Komatsu, Kenji; Ohyama, Takehiro; Sakurai, Masato; Narimoto, Kazutaka; Matsushita, Kazuhito; Hattori, Kazunori",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12889; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33145955/,8

This study aimed to validate a culturally appropriate Vietnamese version of the Brief COPE for the evaluation of coping strategies in people living with HIV/AIDS in Vietnam. We translated the Brief COPE into Vietnamese, and it was self-administered among 1,164 HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy at a large HIV outpatient clinic in Hanoi between January 2019 and March 2020. Data on demographics and HIV-related information, depression and social support were also collected. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) were conducted to assess construct validity. Content validity, internal consistency, and convergent validity were also assessed. The CFA of a 14-factor structure of the original Brief COPE revealed acceptable model fitness, but poor internal consistency for some subscales. In the subsequent EFA, we found a revised 26-item version which had a six-factor structure consisting of problem-solving, avoidance, humor, social support, religion, and substance use. The final CFA found that the model fitness of the revised scale with fewer factor structures was comparable to that of the original Brief COPE; the internal consistency of the revised scale was even better than that of the original scale. Furthermore, six factors of the revised scale showed anticipated associations with depression and social support.","Matsumoto, Shoko; Yamaoka, Kazue; Nguyen, Hoai Dung Thi; Nguyen, Dung Thi; Nagai, Moeko; Tanuma, Junko; Mizushima, Daisuke; Nguyen, Kinh Van; Pham, Thach Ngoc; Oka, Shinichi",Global health & medicine,https://doi.org/10.35772/ghm.2020.01064; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33409417/,8
119837,White matter apoptosis is increased by delayed hypothermia and rewarming in a neonatal piglet model of hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy.,2016,"This study aimed to characterize risk groups for COVID-19 in Brazil and to estimate the number of individuals living in the same household with persons in the risk group. Data were used from the Brazilian National Health Survey (PNS) of 2013. To characterize the risk groups, a binary multiple logistic regression model was adjusted in which the response variable was the presence or absence of at least one condition associated with COVID-19 and the explanatory variables were age, sex, major geographic region, color or race, schooling, and workforce status of the residents interviewed by the study. The results show that age is the principal risk factor for comorbidities associated with COVID-19, but the risk is also greater for persons in more vulnerable categories, such as those with less schooling and blacks and browns. An estimated 68.7% of Brazilians were living with at least one person in the risk group: 30.3% lived with at least one elderly individual and another 38.4% had no elderly individuals in their households, but there was at least one adult resident with preexisting medical conditions. The proportion of persons living in households with at least one resident in the risk group was 50% or greater for all ages and increased from 35 years of age, but there were also high numbers of persons 10 to 25 years of age living with persons in the risk group. The results suggest that due to the difficulties in avoiding close household contact, the exclusive isolation of specific population groups is not a feasible strategy in the Brazilian context, but should be combined with social distancing of the population as a whole.","Borges, Gabriel Mendes; Crespo, Claudio Dutra",Cadernos de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00141020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33111839/,8

121087,Complete penile amputation during ritual neonatal circumcision and successful replantation using postoperative leech therapy.,2014,"BACKGROUND A notable feature of COVID-19 is that children are less susceptible to severe disease. Children are known to experience more infections with endemic human coronaviruses (HCoVs) compared to adults. Little is known whether HCoV infections lead to cross-reactive anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. METHODS We investigated the presence of cross-reactive anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies (to spike(S)1, S1-receptor-binding receptor (S1-RBD) and nucleocapsid protein(NP)), by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and neutralizing activity by a SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped virus neutralisation assay, in pre-pandemic sera collected from children(n=50) and adults(n=45), and compared with serum samples from convalescent COVID-19 patients(n=16). RESULTS A significant proportion of children (up to 40%) had detectable cross-reactive antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 S1, S1-RBD and NP antigens, and the anti-S1 and -S1-RBD antibody levels correlated with anti-HCoV-HKU1 and -OC43 S1 antibody titers in pre-pandemic samples(p<0.001). There were marked increases of anti-HCoV-HKU1 and -OC43 S1 (but not anti-NL63 and -229E S-RBD) antibody titres in serum samples from convalescent COVID-19 patients(p<0.001), indicating an activation of cross-reactive immunological memory to β-coronavirus spike. CONCLUSIONS We demonstrated cross-reactive anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in pre-pandemic serum samples from children and young adults. Promoting this cross-reactive immunity and memory response derived from common HCoV may be an effective strategy against SARS-COV-2 and future novel coronaviruses.","Sharwani, Khalid; Sharma, Ravi; Krishnan, Madhan; Jones, Terry; Mayora-Neto, Martin; Cantoni, Diego; Temperton, Nigel A; Dobson, Susan L; Subramaniam, Krishanthi; McNamara, Paul S; Cunliffe, Nigel A; Turtle, Lance; Zhang, Qibo",The Journal of infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1093/infdis/jiab333; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34161567/,8

METHODS Using a database from a single primary care stroke center, discharge disposition, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Totaled Health Risks in Vascular Events (THRIVE), Houston Intra-Arterial Therapy 2 (HIAT-2), and Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores, and successful reperfusion were obtained. Univariate analysis was performed to assess predictors of good clinical outcome, as defined by 90 day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores ≤2. A binary logistic regression model was used to determine the impact of placement to an IRF versus an SNF on clinical outcomes. RESULTS 147 subjects were included in the analysis with a mean age of 63±14 years and median NIHSS of 18 (IQR 14-21). Final infarct volumes, and modified APACHE II, THRIVE, and HIAT-2 scores were similar between those discharged to an IRF and those discharged to an SNF.However, their 90 day outcomes were significantly different, with far fewer patients at SNFs achieving good clinical outcomes (25% vs 46%; p=0.023). Disposition to SNF was significantly associated with a lower probability of achieving an mRS score of 0-2 at 90 days (OR = 0.337 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.94); p<0.04). CONCLUSIONS Subjects discharged to SNFs and IRFs after thrombectomy have similar medical and neurological severity at admission and similar final infarct volumes at discharge. Despite these similarities, patients discharged to an SNF had a significantly lower probability of achieving a good neurological outcome. These results have implications for future acute stroke trial design.","Belagaje, Samir R; Sun, Chung-Huan J; Nogueira, Raul G; Glenn, Brenda A; Wuermser, Lisa Ann; Patel, Vishal; Frankel, Michael R; Anderson, Aaron M; Thomas, Tommy T; Horn, Christopher M; Gupta, Rishi",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,https://doi.org/10.1136/neurintsurg-2013-011045; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24443413/,8

121753,Imaging Enterobacterales infections in patients using pathogen-specific positron emission tomography.,2021-04-14,"Cotton fabrics with durable and reusable daylight-induced antibacterial/antiviral functions were developed by using a novel fabrication process, which employs strong electrostatic interaction between cationic cotton fibers and anionic photosensitizers. The cationic cotton contains polycationic short chains produced by a self-propagation of 2-diehtylaminoehtyl chloride (DEAE-Cl) on the surface of cotton fibers. Then, the fabric (i.e., polyDEAE@cotton) can be readily functionalized with anionic photosensitizers like rose Bengal and sodium 2-anthraquinone sulfate to produce biocidal reactive oxygen species (ROS) under light exposure and consequently provide the photo-induced biocidal functions. The biocidal properties of the photo-induced fabrics (PIFs) were demonstrated by ROS production measurements, bactericidal performance against bacteria (e.g., E coli and L. innocua), and antiviral results against T7 bacteriophage. The PIFs achieved 99.9999% (6 log) reductions against bacteria and the bacteriophage within 60 min of daylight exposure. Moreover, the PIFs showcase excellent washability and photostability, making them ideal materials for reusable face masks and protective suits with improved biological protections compared with traditional PPE. This work demonstrated that the cationized cotton could serve as a platform for different functionalization applications, and the resulting fiber materials could inspire the development of reusable and sustainable PPE with significant bioprotective properties to fight the COVID-19 pandemic as well as the spread of other contagious diseases.","Tang, Peixin; Zhang, Zheng; El-Moghazy, Ahmed Y; Wisuthiphaet, Nicharee; Nitin, Nitin; Sun, Gang",ACS applied materials & interfaces,https://doi.org/10.1021/acsami.0c15540; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33090782/,8

The sperm motility of frozen-thawed semen with 0-group was significantly better compared with cysteine and ascorbic acid groups. The variation on viability, sperm membrane integrity and morphology were insignificant between all treated groups. Therefore, these enzymes were reduced when using antioxidants in the freezing extender. Results of the present study suggest that concentration of ALP, LDH and GGT enzymes could be used as parameters for prediction of frozen-thawed stallion semen.","Alamaary, Mohaammed S; Haron, Abd W; Hiew, Mark W H; Ali, Mohamed",Veterinary medicine and science,https://doi.org/10.1002/vms3.315; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602662/,8

MATERIAL AND METHODS Ovine ADSC (oADSC) were isolated from seven sheep and cultured using serum-free and osteogenic conditions. Prior to in vivo testing, the growth and osteogenic behaviour of these cells were analysed in vitro using cell proliferation and extracellular matrix mineralisation assays. The bone regenerative capacity of autologous oADSC was evaluated in vivo on titanium discs in a sheep femur epicondyle model. Machined (MTi) and alumina-blasted (ABTi) titanium discs were used. Bone regeneration within the defects was evaluated after 1 month using histology and histomorphometry. PKH26 cell-tracking dye was used to verify the persistence of oADSC in the surgical wound. RESULTS oADSC sourced from five of seven sheep differentiated into osteoblast-like cells. Cellular proliferation was reduced only for osteogenically induced oADSC (oOS-ADSC) grown on ABTi, compared to non-induced oADSC grown on ABTi and tissue culture polystyrene (P = 0.03 and 0.02 respectively). There was no significant difference for in vitro mineralisation assays comparing oADSC with oOS-ADSC, regardless of implant surface type. oADSC labelled with PKH26 were detected 1 month after surgery within the defect. There was no difference in bone regeneration between the bone defects treated with oADSC vs. just blood clot. CONCLUSION After 1-month healing, the use of autologous oADSC did not improve bone regeneration in defects containing titanium devices with different surfaces.","Godoy Zanicotti, Diogo; Coates, Dawn Elizabeth; Duncan, Warwick John",Clinical oral implants research,https://doi.org/10.1111/clr.12761; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26853552/,8
122245,Incidence of contrast material-induced nephropathy after neuroendovascular procedures.,2014,"BACKGROUND Simulation is incorporated into medical education to reinforce practical skills. Instructor methodologies allow for reflective practice through debriefing; however, this is limited to real-time audiences. Few studies have described education via supplemental materials. OBJECTIVE This educational initiative demonstrates the reception and use of a postsimulation newsletter for both participating and nonparticipating trauma team members. METHODS After each case, the Trauma Takeaways newsletter was distributed to all trauma team members at our Level I pediatric trauma center. The newsletter included a brief case summary, objectives, and debrief highlights regarding communication, medical management, and practical logistics. A survey was conducted to assess its utility 6 months after its introduction. RESULTS Of 69 interdisciplinary respondents, 46 reviewed the newsletter. The majority (69%) reported their trauma education is directly from simulation sessions. Thirty-nine percent of respondents found the newsletter most useful as a review when unable to attend, and 35% found it equally useful as compared with being an active participant. The majority of respondents found the newsletter either very helpful or extremely helpful. CONCLUSIONS Medical simulation cases traditionally capture a select audience during educational debriefing sessions. However, because the majority of our respondents receive their trauma education from simulation sessions, the need for supplementation is paramount. Our team members found the Takeaways similarly useful both as a direct participant or as an indirect participant as a helpful reference for communication, management, and practical logistics in pediatric trauma care.","Patel, Katie J; Williamson, Kristy; LaMaina, Laura; Bullaro, Francesca",Journal of trauma nursing : the official journal of the Society of Trauma Nurses,https://doi.org/10.1097/jtn.0000000000000595; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34210947/,8
122317,Selection and Application of Tissue microRNAs for Nonendoscopic Diagnosis of Barrett's Esophagus.,2018,"COVID-19 has created enormous challenges for health systems worldwide, with the rapidly growing number of deaths and critical patients with pneumonia requiring ventilatory support. Alternative methods to control the spread of the disease such as social isolation, extreme quarantine measures, and contact tracing have been used around the world. However, these measures may not be totally effective to fight COVID-19, in step with the necessary national preparations to meet the new patient care demands. A wide range of digital technologies can be used to enhance these public health strategies, and the pandemic has sparked increasing use of telehealth. This field has grown considerably in Brazil in recent years. Still, despite the intense proliferation of recommendations and rules, until the current pandemic the country still lacked a fully consolidated regulatory framework. The emergence of COVID-19 marks a key moment in the expansion of applications and use of telehealth for improving the health system's response to the current crisis. The article discusses telehealth's contribution to the fight against COVID-19 and the recent initiatives triggered in Brazil as opportunities for the consolidation of telemedicine and improvement of the Brazilian Unified National Health System.

122425,Current status of home monitoring technology for age-related macular degeneration.,2021-03-11,"BACKGROUND Face coverings are recommended to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Guidelines regarding face mask use have evolved from the time when COVID-19 first emerged. Practices for face mask use in the United States vary widely. METHODS Clinical and nonclinical staff from a pediatric health care system were invited to complete a survey regarding perceptions and practices of face mask use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall results were analyzed, and subgroup analyses were conducted to compare clinical and nonclinical staff, and clinical staff who do and do not provide direct patient care. RESULTS The response rate was approximately 24% (1,128 of 4,698). Most respondents were clinical staff who provide patient care. A surgical/procedure mask was most often worn for patient care by 72% (P < .001). Most respondents (70%) reported wearing a cloth mask when not in the hospital (P < .001). Cloth masks were worn for a mean of 3.4 ± 3.9 d before washing. Frequent hand hygiene before putting on the mask, before removing, and after removing was reported as 56%, 44%, and 62%, respectively. The most common challenges reported were glasses fogging (69%), skin irritations (45%), and headaches (31%). Qualitative data revealed themes of feeling unsafe, beliefs and practices about COVID-19 and masks, mandates and enforcement of wearing masks, availability of personal protective equipment, and care delivery challenges. CONCLUSIONS Practices and perceptions of face masks varied among staff in a pediatric health care system. Some staff did not feel that masks are effective in preventing virus spread, and others did not feel safe in performing job duties. Hand hygiene for mask handling was not practiced consistently. A large number of staff reported having experienced challenges or health issues when wearing a mask. Clinical staff who provide direct patient care reported more issues than both nonclinical and clinical staff who do not provide care.","Willis, L Denise; Lovenstein, Austin; Spray, Beverly J; Honeycutt, Michele; Walden, Marlene",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.08944; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34035147/,8
122563,Reopening Primary Schools during the Pandemic.,2020-07-29,"OBJECTIVE The study aimed to compare the quantitative blood loss (QBL) and hemorrhage-related outcomes of pregnant women with and without a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diagnosis. STUDY DESIGN This retrospective cohort study of all live deliveries at Boston Medical Center between April 1, 2020 and July 22, 2020 compares the outcomes of pregnant women with a laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 positive diagnosis and pregnant women without COVID-19. The primary outcomes are QBL and obstetric hemorrhage. The secondary outcomes analyzed were a maternal composite outcome that consisted of obstetric hemorrhage, telemetry-level (intermediate care unit) or intensive care unit, transfusion, length of stay greater than 5 days, or intraamniotic infection, and individual components of the maternal composite outcome. Groups were compared using Student's t-test, Chi-squared tests, or Fisher's exact. Logistic regression was used to adjust for confounding variables. RESULTS Of 813 women who delivered a live infant between April 1 and July 22, 2020, 53 women were diagnosed with COVID-19 on admission to the hospital. Women with a COVID-19 diagnosis at their time of delivery were significantly more likely to identify as a race other than white (p = 0.01), to deliver preterm (p = 0.05), to be diagnosed with preeclampsia with severe features (p < 0.01), and to require general anesthesia (p < 0.01). Women diagnosed with COVID-19 did not have a significantly higher QBL (p = 0.64). COVID-19 positive pregnant patients had no increased adjusted odds of obstetric hemorrhage (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 0.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.17-1.04) and no increased adjusted odds of the maternal morbidity composite (aOR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.50-1.93) when compared with those without a diagnosis of COVID-19. CONCLUSION Pregnant women with COVID-19 diagnosis do not have increased risk for obstetric hemorrhage, increased QBL or risk of maternal morbidity compared with pregnant women without a COVID-19 diagnosis. Further research is needed to describe the impact of a COVID-19 diagnosis on maternal hematologic physiology and pregnancy outcomes.

122690,Osteochondromas after total-body irradiation.,2011,"With the advent of high-resolution and cost-effective genomics and bioinformatics tools and methods contributing to a large database of both human (HAdV) and simian (SAdV) adenoviruses, a genomics-based re-evaluation of their taxonomy is warranted. Interest in these particular adenoviruses is growing in part due to the applications of both in gene transfer protocols, including gene therapy and vaccines, as well in oncolytic protocols. In particular, the re-evaluation of SAdVs as appropriate vectors in humans is important as zoonosis precludes the assumption that human immune system may be naïve to these vectors. Additionally, as important pathogens, adenoviruses are a model organism system for understanding viral pathogen emergence through zoonosis and anthroponosis, particularly among the primate species, along with recombination, host adaptation, and selection, as evidenced by one long-standing human respiratory pathogen HAdV-4 and a recent re-evaluation of another, HAdV-76. The latter reflects the insights on amphizoonosis, defined as infections in both directions among host species including ""other than human"", that are possible with the growing database of nonhuman adenovirus genomes. HAdV-76 is a recombinant that has been isolated from human, chimpanzee, and bonobo hosts. On-going and potential impacts of adenoviruses on public health and translational medicine drive this evaluation of 174 whole genome sequences from HAdVs and SAdVs archived in GenBank. The conclusion is that rather than separate HAdV and SAdV phylogenetic lineages, a single, intertwined tree is observed with all HAdVs and SAdVs forming mixed clades. Therefore, a single designation of ""primate adenovirus"" (PrAdV) superseding either HAdV and SAdV is proposed, or alternatively, keeping HAdV for human adenovirus but expanding the SAdV nomenclature officially to include host species identification as in ChAdV for chimpanzee adenovirus, GoAdV for gorilla adenovirus, BoAdV for bonobo adenovirus, and ad libitum.","Kang, June; Ismail, Ashrafali Mohamed; Dehghan, Shoaleh; Rajaiya, Jaya; Allard, Marc W; Lim, Haw Chuan; Dyer, David W; Chodosh, James; Seto, Donald",Cladistics : the international journal of the Willi Hennig Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/cla.12422; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34618969/,8
122762,A Potential miRNA-mRNA Network for Dementia and Hernia Crosstalk.,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIM Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) for dysplastic Barrett's esophagus (BE) is highly effective. RFA failures are infrequent but can be a challenging cohort to manage. There are limited data on the feasibility of liquid nitrogen cryospray ablation for complete eradication of dysplasia (CE-D) and/or intestinal metaplasia (CE-IM) after RFA has failed to achieve CE-IM in patients with dysplastic BE. METHODS This is a retrospective review from two medical centers of prospectively maintained databases looking at patients that underwent liquid nitrogen cryospray ablation for refractory intestinal metaplasia post failed RFA. RESULTS Eighteen patients were identified that met inclusion criteria. Eleven patients had persistent dysplasia and IM following RFA and seven had persistent non-dysplastic IM. More than 80% of patients were male with long-segment BE (median length 8 cm). Seventy two percent of patients with dysplasia achieved CE-D after cryotherapy. Fifty percent (9/18) of all RFA failures achieved CE-IM with cryotherapy. In comparison, RFA has a CE-IM of 78% in a less challenging treatment naïve cohort from a large-scale meta-analysis of 3802 patients. No adverse events occurred in our cohort. CONCLUSION Cryospray ablation is feasible and safe for achieving CE-D and CE-IM after RFA failure. The CE-D rates are high with cryotherapy in this population. CE-IM with cryotherapy is acceptable in this difficult-to-treat cohort when compared to CE-IM rates with RFA in dysplastic BE treatment naïve patients (50% vs 78%).","Trindade, Arvind J; Inamdar, Sumant; Kothari, Shivangi; Berkowitz, Joshua; McKinley, Matthew; Kaul, Vivek",Digestive endoscopy : official journal of the Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/den.12869; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28303613/,8

This pathway occurs via diffusion and gravity-induced drift of single virions and respiratory droplets consisting primarily of water, including small fraction of nonvolatile matter, and containing virions. These processes are accompanied by water evaporation resulting in reduction of the droplet size. The manifold of information concerning these steps is presented in textbooks and articles not related to virology and the focus is there frequently on biologically irrelevant conditions and/or droplet sizes. In this brief review, we systematically describe the behaviour of virions and virion-carrying droplets in air with emphasis on various regimes of diffusion, drift, and evaporation, and estimate the rates of all these steps under virologically relevant conditions. In addition, we discuss the kinetic aspects of the first steps of infection after attachment of virions or virion-carrying droplets to the epithelium, i.e., virion diffusion in the mucus and periciliary layers, penetration into the cells, and the early stage of replication. The presentation is oriented to virologists who are interested in the corresponding physics and to physicists who are in interested in application of the physics to virology.","Zhdanov, Vladimir P; Kasemo, Bengt",Bio Systems,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biosystems.2020.104241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32896576/,8

Host innate immunity initially recognizes the viral invasion and induces a rapid inflammatory response, and this recognition activates signaling cascades that trigger the release of antiviral mediators. This chapter aims to explore the mechanisms by which newly emerged coronavirus called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) activates the host immune system. Since SARS-CoV-2 shares similarities with SARS-CoV that caused the epidemic of SARS in 2003, the pathogenesis of both viruses could be at least very similar. For this, this chapter provides a synthesis of literature concerning antiviral immunity in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. It includes the presentation of epitopes linked to SARS-CoV-2 as well as the ability of SARS-CoV-2 to cause proteolytic activation and interact with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) via molecular mimicry. This chapter characterizes various mechanisms that this virus may engage in escaping the host immunity, ended by a discussion of humoral immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.","Akbarpour, Mahzad; Sharifi, Laleh; Safdarian, Amir Reza; Farhangnia, Pooya; Borjkhani, Mahdis; Rezaei, Nima",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-63761-3_9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33973177/,8

In this study, Aeromonas hydrophila strains with different resistance levels to oxytetracycline (OXY) were induced by sublethal antibiotic selection pressure, and differential expression of proteins were compared among them using iTRAQ based quantitative proteomics. Our following bioinformatic analysis showed that energy metabolism related proteins were down-regulated, while several iron related proteins were up-regulated in high OXY-resistant strains. To further investigate the role of spontaneous OXY resistance evolution, four TonB-dependent receptor coded genes were deleted, and their OXY susceptibility capabilities and antibiotic evolutionary assays were performed, respectively. Our results showed that the deletion of these genes no affected the susceptibility to OXY, but showed different evolution rates in the spontaneous oxytetracycline evolution compared with wild-type strain, especially for AHA_0971 and AHA_4251. Therefore, this study indicated the important role of TonB-dependent receptor proteins during the bacterial antibiotics resistance evolution and may provide a new prophylactic strategy against the development of antibiotic resistance.

123308,Hand-Assisted Robotic Surgery for Staging of Ovarian Cancer and Uterine Cancers With High Risk of Peritoneal Spread: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,2015,"Mental health disorders are a burgeoning global public health challenge, and disproportionately affect the poor. Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) bear 80 % of the mental health disease burden. Stigma associated with mental health results in delayed help seeking, reduced access to health services, suboptimal treatment, poor outcomes and an increased risk of individuals' human rights violations. Moreover, widespread co-occurrence of physical comorbidities such as noncommunicable diseases with mental health disorders makes the treatment of both conditions challenging and worsens prognosis. This paper explores various aspects of stigma towards mental health with a focus on LMICs and assesses measures to increase help-seeking and access to and uptake of mental health services. Stigma impacts persons living with mental illness, their families and caregivers and healthcare professionals (mental health professionals, non-psychiatric specialists and general practitioners) imparting mental health care. Cultural, socio-economic and religious factors determine various aspects of mental health in LMICs, ranging from perceptions of health and illness, health seeking behavior, attitudes of the individuals and health practitioners and mental health systems. Addressing stigma requires comprehensive and inclusive mental health policies and legislations; sustainable and culturally-adapted awareness programs; capacity building of mental health workforce through task-shifting and interprofessional approaches; and improved access to mental health services by integration with primary healthcare and utilizing existing pathways of care. Future strategies targeting stigma reduction must consider the enormous physical comorbidity burden associated with mental health, prioritize workplace interventions and importantly, address the deterioration of population mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic.","Javed, Afzal; Lee, Cheng; Zakaria, Hazli; Buenaventura, Robert D; Cetkovich-Bakmas, Marcelo; Duailibi, Kalil; Ng, Bernardo; Ramy, Hisham; Saha, Gautam; Arifeen, Shams; Elorza, Paola M; Ratnasingham, Priyan; Azeem, Muhammad Waqar",Asian journal of psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102601; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33611083/,8

Herein we study the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on endoscopic surveillance in Lynch syndrome through a prospective study of Lynch syndrome patients at a tertiary referral center who were scheduled for endoscopic surveillance during the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown between 3/16/2020 and 6/4/2020. Of our cohort of 302 individuals with Lynch syndrome, 34 (11%) had endoscopic procedures scheduled during the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown. Of the 27 patients whose endoscopic surveillance was canceled during this period, 85% rescheduled procedures within six months with a median delay of 72 days (IQR 55-84 days), with identification of an advanced adenoma or gastrointestinal cancer in 13%. Individuals who did not have a rescheduled endoscopic procedure were significantly younger than those with a rescheduled procedure (age 35 [IQR 26-43] vs. age 55 [IQR 43-63], p = 0.018). Male sex was also suggestive of increasing likelihood of not having a rescheduled procedure. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown led to delayed endoscopic surveillance in Lynch syndrome, with potentially impactful delays among young patients. This data also emphasizes the importance of timely surveillance in Lynch syndrome during this current, as well as potential future, global pandemics.","McKenna, Danielle B; Dudzik, Christina M; Kumar, Shria; Mahmud, Nadim; Katona, Bryson W",Cancer prevention research,https://doi.org/10.1158/1940-6207.capr-20-0565; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33627398/,8

A Karlson-Holm-Breen (KHB) analysis was used to assess whether depressive symptoms attenuate this association. RESULTS Bivariate results indicated that longer sleep duration was associated with lower incidence of digital self-harm. Multivariate results showed that sleep duration was inversely associated with engaging in digital self-harm, net of all covariates. Depressive symptoms attenuated the influence of sleep duration on digital self-harm by 50.72%. CONCLUSIONS Both insufficient sleep and depressive symptoms were associated with engagement in digital self-harm among adolescents. Prospective research is needed, however, to confirm this pathway. Practitioners and clinicians should consider discussing digital self-harm with adolescents and parents, especially if adolescents are experiencing poor sleep and depressive symptoms.","Semenza, Daniel C; Meldrum, Ryan C; Testa, Alexander; Jackson, Dylan B",Child and adolescent mental health,https://doi.org/10.1111/camh.12457; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33763977/,8

Simulation may be a powerful pedagogical tool for simultaneously teaching knowledge, skills and attitudes. We aim to assess the effectiveness of simulation for initial and continuous training in psychiatry for healthcare professionals. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A comprehensive search for randomised and non-randomised controlled studies and single-group pretest/post-test reports will be conducted in electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL, PsychINFO, ERIC, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) and the Web of Science (Science and Social Sciences Citation Index), with a detailed query. The reference lists of selected studies, key journals and trial registers will also be searched for additional studies. Two independent reviewers, following predefined inclusion criteria, will screen titles and abstracts first and then the full texts of the remaining articles. A third author will evaluate discrepancies to reach a consensus. It will include randomised controlled trial (RCT), non-RCT, pre-test/post-test design studies, post-test design for satisfaction evaluation and qualitative studies. Risk of bias will be assessed by using the Cochrane Collaboration Tool for assessing risk of bias in RCTs. Meta-analyses will be performed if we find sufficient studies that assess predefined outcomes and if their characteristics are not too different. The quality of evidence will be assessed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. A narrative synthesis will be performed for qualitative studies and when meta-analyses are deemed not possible. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics permission is not required.

Data were from two national samples of adults collected in 1995 (n = 7,108) and 2012 (n = 3,577) as part of the Midlife in the United States study. Three measures of childhood SED (parent occupational prestige, childhood poverty exposure, and parent education) were combined into an aggregate index and examined separately. The association between childhood SED (aggregate index) and five health outcomes (BMI, waist circumference, chronic conditions, functional limitations, and self-rated health) was stronger in the 2012 sample than the 1995 sample, with the magnitude of associations being approximately twice as large in the more recent sample. Results persisted after adjusting for age, sex, race, marital status, and number of children, and were similar across all three measures of childhood SED. The findings suggest that the socioeconomic circumstances of childhood may have become a stronger predictor of adult health in recent decades.","Fuller-Rowell, Thomas E; Nichols, Olivia I; Jokela, Markus; Kim, Eric S; Yildirim, Elif Dede; Ryff, Carol D",American journal of epidemiology,https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwab060; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33710274/,8

RAE has become a useful adjunct to medical resuscitation in severe penetrating, iatrogenic or blunt renal traumatisms with active bleeding, and might avoid surgical intervention, particularly among patients that are haemodynamically stable. The role of RAE in pre-operative or palliative management of advanced malignant renal tumours remains debated; however, RAE is recommended as a first-line therapy for bleeding angiomyolipomas and can be used as a preventative treatment for angiomyolipomas at risk of bleeding. RAE represents an alternative to nephrectomy in various medical conditions, including severe uncontrolled hypertension among patients with end-stage renal disease, renal graft intolerance syndrome or autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. RAE is increasingly used to treat renal artery aneurysms or symptomatic renal arteriovenous malformations, with a low complication rate as compared with surgical alternatives.

126092,Rewarming from therapeutic hypothermia induces cortical neuron apoptosis in a swine model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.,2015,"BACKGROUND Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective treatment in C. difficile infection (CDI) and is currently being investigated in other diseases. There is concern around the safety of FMT and that side effects or complications may be under-reported in the medical literature. AIM To evaluate the safety of FMT by summarising the overall reported Adverse Events (AEs) over a 20-year period METHODS: We searched EMBASE, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Library databases, and CNKI and Wanfang Data from January 2000 to April 2020. All original studies reporting FMT-related AEs were considered for inclusion. FMT-related AEs were further classified as delivery-related or microbiota-related. RESULTS Based on the inclusion criteria, 129 studies, which included 4241 patients (5688 FMT courses), were finally eligible. The most common indication for FMT was CDI. Overall, FMT-related AEs were observed in 19% of FMT procedures. The most frequently reported FMT-related AEs were diarrhoea (10%) and abdominal discomfort/pain/cramping (7%). FMT-related serious adverse events (SAEs), including infections and deaths, have been reported in 1.4% of patients who underwent FMT (0.99% microbiota-related SAEs). Four of five FMT-related deaths were reported in patients receiving FMT via the upper gastrointestinal route. Importantly, all reported FMT-related SAEs were in patients with mucosal barrier injury. CONCLUSION Most FMT-related AEs were mild or moderate and self-limiting. Although FMT appears to be highly safe, its methodology should be improved to reduce both delivery-related AEs and, microbiota-related AEs.","Marcella, Cicilia; Cui, Bota; Kelly, Colleen R; Ianiro, Gianluca; Cammarota, Giovanni; Zhang, Faming",Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/apt.16148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33159374/,8

126499,HIPAA at 25 - A Work in Progress.,2021-06-10,"BACKGROUND During the Italian Phase-2 of the coronavirus pandemic, it was possible to restart elective surgeries. Because hospitals were still burdened with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients, it was focal to design a separate ""clean path"" for the surgical candidates and determine the possible effects of major surgery on previously infected patients. METHODS From May to July 2020 (postpandemic peak), 259 consecutive patients were scheduled for elective cardiac surgery in three different centers. Our original roadmap with four screening steps included: a short item questionnaire (STEP-1), nasopharyngeal swab (NP) (STEP-2), computed tomography (CT)-scan using COVID-19 reporting and data system (CO-RADS) scoring (STEP-3), and final NP swab before discharge (STEP-4). RESULTS Two patients (0.8%) resulted positive at STEP-2: one patient was discharged home for quarantine, the other performed a CT-scan (CO-RADS: <2), and underwent surgery for unstable angina. Chest-CT was positive in 6.3% (15/237) with mean CO-RADS of 2.93 ± 0.8. Mild-moderate lung inflammation (CO-RADS: 2-4) did not delay surgery. Perioperative mortality was 1.15% (3/259), and cumulative incidence of pulmonary complications was 14.6%. At multivariable analysis, only age and cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) time were independently related to pulmonary complications composite outcome (age >75 years: odds ratio [OR]: 2.6; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25-5.57; p = 0.011; CPB >90 min. OR: 4.3; 95% CI: 1.84-10.16; p = 0.001). At 30 days, no periprocedural contagion and rehospitalization for COVID-19 infections were reported. CONCLUSIONS Our structured roadmap supports the safe restarting of an elective cardiac surgery list after a peak of a still ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in an epicenter area. Mild to moderate CT residuals of coronavirus pneumonia do not justify elective cardiac surgery procrastination.","Rosati, Fabrizio; Muneretto, Claudio; Baudo, Massimo; D'Ancona, Giuseppe; Bichi, Samuele; Merlo, Maurizio; Cuko, Besart; Gerometta, Piersilvio; Grazioli, Valentina; Giroletti, Laura; Di Bacco, Lorenzo; Repossini, Alberto; Benussi, Stefano",Journal of cardiac surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/jocs.15776; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34173273/,8

It has been reported that laparoscopic surgery is effective for patients with an MD. PRESENTATION OF CASE A 79-year-old man with melena visited our hospital. Upper gastrointestinal series and colonoscopy showed no bleeding lesion. Double-balloon endoscopy was then performed to examine the small intestine. The examination showed a large diverticulum 80cm proximal to the ileocecal valve and a circular ulcer. MD resection was performed using single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) technique through a 3-cm zig-zag incision in the umbilicus. Three ports were inserted for the scope and forceps devices. The MD was located 80cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. There were no other intestinal lesions. From the wound, the lesion could be easily moved outside the body. The MD including the ulcer lesion was then resected. The patient's postoperative course was good, and he rarely felt wound pain. He started dietary intake three days after surgery and was discharged from hospital eight days after surgery. DISCUSSION SILS technique has attracted attention in the field of laparoscopic surgery. Using a single port with multiple working channels, SILS can reduce the number of incisions and the rates of incisional hernia port site-related complications, as well as improve cosmesis. CONCLUSION A definite diagnosis of an MD was made by double-balloon endoscopy preoperatively. The SILS approach was effective for cosmesis, postoperative pain, and a shortened hospital stay.","Shiraishi, Toshio; Tominaga, Tetsuro; Nonaka, Takashi; Wakata, Kouki; Kunizaki, Masaki; Tobinaga, Shuichi; Sumida, Yorihisa; Hidaka, Shigekazu; Kinoshita, Naoe; Sawai, Terumitsu; Nagayasu, Takeshi",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2017.02.037; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28278439/,8
128447,Evolving ablative therapies for hepatic malignancy.,2014,"ABSTRACT BACKGROUND: Delirium frequently develops in hospitalized patients and results in increased mortality, longer length of stay, and need for transitional care. Neurological patients are at an increased risk for developing delirium. There is a paucity of research on effective prevention strategies for this population. PURPOSE: The objectives of this project were to improve nurses' knowledge and confidence in delirium prevention, design a delirium volunteer program, and establish ongoing monitoring for continued improvement. METHODS: This study is a quality improvement project using a pretest-posttest design to examine the benefits of refocusing care from delirium management to delirium prevention. The sample included 304 patients pre and 332 post intervention. The interventions included delirium education for nurses and the recruitment of trained volunteers to implement nonpharmacological, multicomponent delirium prevention interventions. RESULTS: Forty-eight nurses completed delirium education, and 11 volunteers were recruited and trained. There was a significant increase in nursing knowledge (z = 3.967, P < .0005) and confidence (z = 3.989, P < .0005). Volunteers visited 54 patients and implemented 99 interventions post implementation. CONCLUSION: This pre-post improvement project provides beginning evidence that nursing education increased nurses' knowledge and confidence in preventing and treating delirium. Trained volunteers supported using nonpharmacological delirium prevention interventions, but ongoing evaluation is needed to determine the impact of volunteers on delirium rates.","Cyrus, Teresa; Wenthold, Rebecca; Hall, Brenda; Tu, Lisa; Hedquist, Katie; Omodt, Jean; Kozub, Elizabeth; Guthrie, Patricia Finch",The Journal of neuroscience nursing : journal of the American Association of Neuroscience Nurses,https://doi.org/10.1097/jnn.0000000000000580; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33605651/,8
128576,Integrative Physiology of Pneumonia.,2018,"Due to the Covid-19 pandemic's consequences and the state of alarm, literature has shown that people worldwide have experienced severe stressors that have been associated with increased prevalence of emotional distress. In this study we explored psychological distress (depression, anxiety, and somatization symptoms) using an online survey platform in a sample of 1781 Spanish adults during the confinement due to COVID-19, relationships between distress and sleep problems, affect, pain, sleep, emotional regulation, gender, type of housing, history of psychopathology, and living alone during the confinement, and differences depending on demographic and psychological variables. Results showed that between 25-39% of the sample referred to clinically significant levels of distress. In addition, women showed higher levels of distress, negative affect, perception of pain, and cognitive reappraisal, and lower levels of emotional suppression and sleep quality than men. A history of psychopathology, being younger, living alone or in a flat was associated with higher distress. Finally, the variables most strongly related to distress were negative and positive affect, levels of pain, sleep quality, and emotional suppression. Our results highlight the important role of emotional suppression, cognitive reappraisal, and loneliness, and the impact of being a woman and younger in Spain during the Covid -19 pandemic. Therefore, it would be necessary to provide assessments of distress levels in these population groups and focus psychological preventive and therapeutic online interventions on expressing emotions and preventing loneliness.","Pérez, S; Masegoso, A; Hernández-Espeso, N",Clinical psychology & psychotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1002/cpp.2523; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33119922/,8

This study aimed to investigate the impact of pandemic-associated stress on food parenting practices including interactions surrounding snacks, and child diet. METHODS Parents (N = 318) of 2-12-year old children completed a cross-sectional online survey assessing current COVID-19-specific stress, pre-COVID-19 stress, financial stress (e.g. food insecurity), food parenting practices, and child snack intake frequency. Structural Equation Modeling was used to model simultaneous paths of relationships and test direct and indirect effects. RESULTS Stress, including financial hardship, was higher compared with before the crisis. The majority of children had regular mealtimes and irregular snack times. Higher COVID-19-specific stress was associated with more non-nutritive use of food and snacks (e.g. emotional and instrumental feeding), but also more structure and positive interactions (e.g. eating with or engaging with child around mealtimes). Higher COVID-19-specific stress was also associated with greater child intake frequency of sweet and savory snacks, with some evidence for mediation by snack parenting practices. CONCLUSION Our findings indicate that stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may be linked to child snack intake with potential impacts on child obesity risk, and suggest several modifiable points of intervention within the family context.","Jansen, E; Thapaliya, G; Aghababian, A; Sadler, J; Smith, K; Carnell, S",Appetite,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105119; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33450298/,8
129277,Chemical-Biological Terrorism and Its Impact on Children.,2020-01-27,"Vitamin D is associated with various diseases such as obesity, digestive problems, osteoporosis, depression, and infections, which has emerged as an interest in public healthcare. Recently, vitamin D has received more attention because of the potential implication with coronavirus disease 2019. In this study, we developed a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) aptasensor based on polyethylene-glycol(PEG)-free gold nanorods (AuNRs) for the wide-range and direct detection of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3. The surfactant on AuNRs was removed by exchanging with polystyrene sulfonate (PSS) instead of PEG then the PSS was exchanged with citrate. By exchanging the stabilizer of AuNRs from PEG to PEG-free (i.e., citrate), the sensing efficiency of LSPR aptasensor was significantly improved. Additionally, LSPR aptasensor was functionalized with aptamer and blocking agent to enhance the sensing performance. The LSPR aptasensor achieved the direct, highly sensitive, and selective detection of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 over a wide concentration range (0.1-105 ng/mL), with a limit of detection of 0.1 ng/mL. This detection range included the concentration of vitamin D from deficiency to excess. The PEG-free AuNR-based LSPR aptasensor affords a new avenue for the development of robust sensing technology for vitamins.","Jo, Seongjae; Lee, Wonseok; Park, Joohyung; Park, Hyunjun; Kim, Minwoo; Kim, Woochang; Hong, Junghwa; Park, Jinsung",Biosensors & bioelectronics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2021.113118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33721722/,8

129314,Radiofrequency ablation for refractory gastric antral vascular ectasia (with video).,2013,"BACKGROUND The treatment of multimorbid patients is one crucial task in general practice as multimorbidity is highly prevalent in this setting. However, there is little evidence how to treat these patients and consequently there are but a few guidelines that focus primarily on multimorbidity. Big data analytics are defined as a method that obtains results for high volume data with high variety generated at high velocity. Yet, the explanatory power of these results is not completely understood. Nevertheless, addressing multimorbidity as a complex condition might be a promising field for big data analytics. The aim of this scoping review was to evaluate whether applying big data analytics on patient data does already contribute to the treatment of multimorbid patients in general practice. METHODS In January 2018, a review searching the databases PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, using defined search terms for ""big data analytics"" and ""multimorbidity"", supplemented by a search of grey literature with Google Scholar, was conducted. Studies were not filtered by type of study, publication year or language. Validity of studies was evaluated independently by two researchers. RESULTS In total, 2392 records were identified for screening. After title and abstract screening, six articles were included in the full-text analysis. Of those articles, one reported on a model generated with big data techniques to help caring for one group of multimorbid patients. The other five articles dealt with the analysis of multimorbidity clusters. No article defined big data analytics explicitly. CONCLUSIONS Although the usage of the phrase ""Big Data"" is growing rapidly, there is nearly no practical use case for big data analysis techniques in the treatment of multimorbidity in general practice yet. Furthermore, in publications addressing big data analytics, the term is rarely defined. However, possible models and algorithms to address multimorbidity in the future are already published.","Waschkau, Alexander; Wilfling, Denise; Steinhäuser, Jost",BMC family practice,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12875-019-0928-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30813904/,8

Telemedicine, in various forms, has been used by patients and medical professionals for quite some time, especially telepsychiatry. To examine the efficacy and role of telesimulation as a method to educate health sciences students via telepresence robots. The study recruited students from the above health science disciplines. All participants were trained to administer a contextual interview to a standardized patient (SP) for mental health concerns. Methods: The completion of the contextual interview observation form adult (CIOF-A), National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index, self-efficacy in patient centeredness questionnaire (SEPCQ), and communication skills attitude scale with or without a telepresence robot. All participants completed baseline metrics and were trained to conduct a contextual interview to an SP. Researchers block-randomized the participants to either the telepresence robot group (TP) or in-person (IP) group. Results: The study recruited n = 43 participants to the IP group (n = 21) or TP group (n = 22). Mean participant demographics of age were 25.3 (±1.9) years in the IP group and 24.3 (±2.1) years for the TP group. Mean and standard deviation scores with effect sizes in CIOF-A scores IP: 0.05 (±1.91) and TP: -0.45 (±1.71), Cohen's d = 0.28; SEPCQ-Patient Domain scores IP: 0.42 (±4.69) and TP: 0.50 (±7.18), Cohen's d = 0.01; change in SEPCQ-Sharing Domain scores IP: 0.53 (±5.10) and TP: 0.91 (±9.98), Cohen's d = 0.05. These effect sizes will inform future studies and appropriate sample sizes.

129995,Outdoor Courier Lockboxes in Summer Are a Significant Source of Preanalytical Error.,2021-06-21,"OBJECTIVE VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) plays a critical role in physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Endothelial 3D podosomes (3DPs) are a type of F-actin-rich membrane microdomain, predominantly found in endothelial tip cells controlled by VEGF signaling during sprouting angiogenesis, such as occurs in retinal vasculature development. The molecular mechanisms governing 3DP formation have not been completely elucidated. Approach and Results: By using in vitro cell models and in vivo mouse models, we study the role of TM (thrombomodulin) in VEGF-induced endothelial 3DPs. Here, we report that VEGF can induce the expression of TM via ROCK2 (Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase 2). Furthermore, ROCK2 can catalyze the phosphorylated activation of ezrin to promote the association of the cytoplasmic domain of TM with F-actin in 3DPs and thereby promote the formation of 3DPs. We used endothelial cells transfected with different TM mutants as models to verify the role of TM domains in 3DPs and angiogenic activity. TM expression in endothelial cells augments angiogenic activity, a response that is dependent on the interaction of the cytoplasmic tail of TM with ezrin, and the integrity of the lectin-like domain of TM. Thus, as compared with wild-type counterparts, mice lacking the lectin-like domain of TM exhibit reduced neovascularization of granulation tissues during cutaneous wound healing and less retinal neovascularization in a model of oxygen-induced retinopathy. CONCLUSIONS VEGF-ROCK2-ezrin-TM-F-actin axis promotes the formation of the lipid raft membrane-associated complex configuration, 3DP, which plays a critical role in mediating tube formation and cell migration of endothelial cells in sprouting angiogenesis.","Kuo, Cheng-Hsiang; Huang, Yi-Hsun; Chen, Po-Ku; Lee, Gang-Hui; Tang, Ming-Jer; Conway, Edward M; Shi, Guey-Yueh; Wu, Hua-Lin","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology",https://doi.org/10.1161/atvbaha.121.315931; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33730876/,8

130101,Reflux and Barrett's disease.,2014,"The explosively expanding COVID-19 pandemic urges the development of safe, efficacious and fast-acting vaccines. Several vaccine platforms are leveraged for a rapid emergency response1. We describe the discovery of a live virus-vectored SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate using the yellow fever 17D (YF17D) vaccine as vector to express a non-cleavable prefusion form of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigen. We assess vaccine safety, immunogenicity and efficacy in several animal models. Vaccine candidate YF-S0 has an outstanding safety profile and induces high levels of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies in hamsters, mice and cynomolgus macaques and concomitantly a protective immunity against YFV. Humoral immunity is complemented by a favourable Th1 cell-mediated immune response as profiled in mice. In a stringent hamster model2 as well as in non-human primates, YF-S0 prevents infection with SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, in hamsters, a single dose confers protection from lung disease in most vaccinated animals within 10 days. Taken together, the quality of immune responses triggered and the rapid kinetics by which protective immunity can be mounted already after a single dose warrant further development this potent SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate.","Sanchez-Felipe, Lorena; Vercruysse, Thomas; Sharma, Sapna; Ma, Ji; Lemmens, Viktor; Van Looveren, Dominique; Javarappa, Mahadesh Prasad Arkalagud; Boudewijns, Robbert; Malengier-Devlies, Bert; Liesenborghs, Laurens; Kaptein, Suzanne J F; De Keyzer, Carolien; Bervoets, Lindsey; Debaveye, Sarah; Rasulova, Madina; Seldeslachts, Laura; Li, Li-Hsin; Jansen, Sander; Yakass, Michael Bright; Verstrepen, Babs E; Böszörményi, Kinga P; Kiemenyi-Kayere, Gwendoline; van Driel, Nikki; Quaye, Osbourne; Zhang, Xin; Ter Horst, Sebastiaan; Mishra, Niraj; Deboutte, Ward; Matthijnssens, Jelle; Coelmont, Lotte; Vandermeulen, Corinne; Heylen, Elisabeth; Vergote, Valentijn; Schols, Dominique; Wang, Zhongde; Bogers, Willy; Kuiken, Thijs; Verschoor, Ernst; Cawthorne, Christopher; Van Laere, Koen; Opdenakker, Ghislain; Velde, Greetje Vande; Weynand, Birgit; Teuwen, Dirk E; Matthys, Patrick; Neyts, Johan; Jan Thibaut, Hendrik; Dallmeier, Kai",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-3035-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33260195/,8

Transmission of this epidemic pathogen occurs mainly via mosquitoes, but it is also capable of placental and sexual transmission. Although the characteristics of these viruses are well defined, infections are unpredictable in terms of disease severity, unusual clinical manifestations, unexpected methods of transmission, long-term persistence, and the development of new strains. Recently, ZIKV has gained huge medical attention following the large-scale epidemics around the world, and reported cases of congenital abnormalities associated with Zika virus infections which have created a public health emergency of international concern. Despite continuous research on ZIKV, no specific treatment or vaccine has been developed, excepting a preventive strategy for congenital ZIKV infection. Probiotics, known as GRAS, are bacteria that confer various health beneficial effects, and have been shown to be effective at curing a number of viral diseases by modulating the immune system. Furthermore, probiotic preparations consisting of dead cells and cellular metabolites, so-called ""Ghost probiotics"", can also act as biological response modifiers. Here, we review available information on the epidemiology, transmission, and clinical features of ZIKV, and on treatment and prevention strategies. In addition, we emphasize the use of probiotics and plant-based natural remedies and describe their action mechanisms, and the green technologies for microbial conversion, which could contribute to the development of novel therapies that may reduce the pathogenicity of ZIKV. Accordingly, we draw attention to new findings, unanswered questions, unresolved issues, and controversies regarding ZIKV.","Bajpai, Vivek K; Chandra, Vishal; Kim, Na-Hyung; Rai, Rajni; Kumar, Pradeep; Kim, Kangmin; Aeron, Abhinav; Kang, Sun Chul; Maheshwari, D K; Na, MinKyun; Rather, Irfan A; Park, Yong-Ha",Critical reviews in biotechnology,https://doi.org/10.1080/07388551.2017.1368445; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28877637/,8
130663,Histopathological features of HER2 overexpression in uterine carcinosarcoma: proposal for requirements in HER2 testing for targeted therapy.,2021-01-09,"INTRODUCTION Anastomotic leak (AL) is a major complication following anterior resection for colorectal cancer. Early contrast enema may diagnose subclinical anastomotic leakage. Knowledge of factors concerning AL is vital to its detection. The aim of this study was to define the incidence, risks and outcome of radiological leak following routine early contrast enema after anterior resection. METHODS A cohort of 129 patients who underwent anterior resection for colorectal cancer and had an early Gastrografin enema between July 2008 and December 2012 in a tertiary referral centre was identified from a prospective database. The severity of AL was defined using the International Study Group of Rectal Cancer (ISREC) grading system. RESULTS Of the 129 patients, 65.1 % were male, and the mean age at surgery was 64.6 ± 1.1 years. Gastrografin enema was performed on average on post-operative day 4.8 ± 0.2. Eighteen patients (14.0 %) had a radiological leak on Gastrografin enema, and nine patients (7.0 %) had a clinical AL. On multivariate analysis, only being of male sex and having a loop ileostomy increased the risk of radiological AL. Gastrografin enema had a sensitivity of 100 % (95 % CI 66-100 %) and specificity of 93 % (95 % CI 86-97 %) for predicting clinical AL. Of the 18 patients with radiological leaks, 11 were ISREC grade A, 3 were grade B and 4 were grade C. CONCLUSIONS In the current series, early Gastrografin enema following anterior resection identifies a 14 % radiological leak rate and has a high sensitivity and specificity for predicting clinical AL. The majority of radiological leaks may be managed conservatively.","Reilly, Frank; Burke, John P; Appelmans, Eline; Manzoor, Talha; Deasy, Joseph; McNamara, Deborah A",International journal of colorectal disease,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00384-013-1820-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24420736/,8

The coronavirus pandemic further highlights the importance of post-viral olfactory dysfunction. Currently, a comprehensive review of the neural mechanism underpinning post-viral olfactory dysfunction is lacking. OBJECTIVES To synthesize the existing primary literature related to olfactory dysfunction secondary to viral infection, detail the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, highlight relevance for the current COVID-19 pandemic, and identify high impact areas of future research. METHODS PubMed and Embase were searched to identify studies reporting primary scientific data on post-viral olfactory dysfunction. Results were supplemented by manual searches. Studies were categorized into animal and human studies for final analysis and summary. RESULTS A total of 38 animal studies and 7 human studies met inclusion criteria and were analyzed. There was significant variability in study design, experimental model, and outcome measured. Viral effects on the olfactory system varies significantly based on viral substrain but generally include damage or alteration in components of the olfactory epithelium and/or the olfactory bulb. CONCLUSIONS The mechanism of post-viral olfactory dysfunction is highly complex, virus-dependent, and involves a combination of insults at multiple levels of the olfactory pathway. This will have important implications for future diagnostic and therapeutic developments for patients infected with COVID-19.","Lee, Jason C; Nallani, Rohit; Cass, Lauren; Bhalla, Vidur; Chiu, Alexander G; Villwock, Jennifer A",American journal of rhinology & allergy,https://doi.org/10.1177/1945892420957853; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32915650/,8

Potential risk of gastric remnant carcinoma development has been suggested. PURPOSE To present the results obtained after LRYGB with resection of distal stomach. METHOD This prospective study includes 400 consecutive patients. The mean body weight was 105.9 ± 16.8 Kg (range 83-145 kg), and body mass index (BMI) was 38.5 ± 4.4 kg/m2 (32.9-50.3). Postoperative morbid-mortality and follow-up were analyzed. RESULTS Operative time was 128.5 ± 18.7 min, hospital discharge occurred at 3rd postoperative day, postoperative complications occurred in 9.25%, early surgical complications were observed in 3% and medical complications 4%, late surgical complications occurred 2.25%, no mortality was observed. At 1 year follow-up, BMI was 25.3 ± 2.7 kg/m2 with % of weight loss (%WL) of 84.6 + 19.1%. At five years follow-up very similar values were observed. CONCLUSION The results obtained after LRYGB with resection of distal stomach are similar to results published after non resection LRYGB regarding early and late results and can be indicated in high risk areas of gastric carcinoma.","Braghetto, Italo; Martinez, Gustavo; Korn, Owen; Zamorano, Marcelo; Lanzarini, Enrique; Narbona, Enrique",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-018-1625-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29450656/,8

This study aimed to perform a systematic review with meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which CO2 insufflation was compared with air insufflation in balloon-assisted enteroscopy. METHODS PubMed, the Cochrane library, and the Igaku-Chuo-Zasshi database were searched to identify RCTs eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. Data from the eligible studies were combined to calculate the pooled odds ratios (ORs) or weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS Four RCTs (461 patients) were identified. Compared with air insufflation, CO2 insufflation significantly increased intubation depth of oral enteroscopy (WMD: 55.2, 95% CI: 10.77-99.65, p = 0.015). However, there was significant heterogeneity. The intubation depth of anal enteroscopy showed no significant difference between the CO2 group and the air group. CO2 insufflation significantly reduced abdominal pain compared with air insufflation (WMD: -2.463, 95% CI: -4.452 to -0.474, p = 0.015), without significant heterogeneity. The PaCO2 or end-tidal CO2 level showed no significant difference between the CO2 group and air group.

The left atrial appendage (LAA) has long been suspected as the principal source of arterial emboli, particularly in nonvalvular AF, and a variety of techniques for its exclusion from the circulation have been developed. This review highlights the history of the LAA as a target of intervention, and the parallel advances in three minimally invasive strategies for its exclusion: percutaneous occlusion of the LAA orifice from within the left atrium, closed-chest ligation via a percutaneous pericardial approach, and minimally invasive thoracoscopic surgery. While further study is necessary, available evidence suggests that effective LAA exclusion is becoming a viable alternative to anticoagulation for stroke prevention in nonvalvular AF.","Moss, Joshua D",Current cardiology reports,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11886-013-0448-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24408675/,8

Methods A single-center randomized trial was conducted on 40 patients receiving a laparo-endoscopic single-site hysterectomy with opportunistic salpingectomy. We randomized patients into two groups at the time of admission to determine the laterality of additional thermal cauterization. Additional thermal cauterization for 10 seconds was applied on the right cornu in one group and on the left cornu in the other group. Three pieces of cornual tissue from each cornu were biopsied. One gynecological pathologist examined the cornual tissue to determine the residual tubal epithelium (TE) and thermal destruction of the specimens. Results Of the 40 patients enrolled in this study between September 2012 and July 2014, samples of 26 patients were subjected to tissue analysis. Residual TE was found in the cornu in 73.1% (19/26) and 65.4 % (17/26) of tissues from the side of no additional cauterization (NO) and the side of additional cauterization (AD), respectively (p < 0.001). Residual TE was detected in 5.3% (1/19) and 94.1% (16/17) of the specimens from the NO and AD groups, respectively. Conclusion We observed that a high incidence of residual TE and efficacious cauterization-induced thermal destruction was achieved following 10 seconds of additional cauterization. These results suggest that additional cauterization of the uterine cornu using the sealing device effectively destroys residual TE after salpingectomy.","Choi, Hyun-Jin; Kim, Hyun-Soo; Kim, Tae-Joong; Song, Sang Yong; Paik, E Sun; Jin Heo, Eun; Park, Jin-Young; Lee, Yoo-Young; Choi, Chel Hun; Lee, Jeong-Won; Kim, Byoung-Gie; Bae, Duk-Soo",Gynecology and minimally invasive therapy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gmit.2016.12.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30254891/,8
132195,A short review on important drugs under clinical trial against Covid-19.,2020-12-17,"The effects of vitamin D on the musculoskeletal system are well established. Its deficiency causes osteomalacia, secondary hyperparathyroidism, and an increased risk for fractures and falls. However, clinical and experimental evidence points to extra-skeletal actions of vitamin D, including on immune and respiratory systems. Thus, during this COVID-19 pandemic, a possible deleterious role of vitamin D deficiency has been questioned. This paper aims to present a brief review of the literature and discuss, based on evidence, the role of vitamin D in the lung function and in the prevention of respiratory infections. Relevant articles were searched in the databases MEDLINE/PubMed and SciELO/LILACS. The mechanisms of vitamin D action in the immune system response will be discussed. Clinical data from systematic reviews and meta-analyses show benefits in the prevention of respiratory infections and improvement of pulmonary function when vitamin D-deficient patients are supplemented. At the time of writing this paper, no published data on vitamin D supplementation for patients with COVID-19 have been found. Vitamin D supplementation is recommended during this period of social isolation to avoid any deficiency, especially in the context of bone outcomes, aiming to achieve normal values of 25(OH)D. The prevention of respiratory infections and improvement of pulmonary function are additional benefits observed when vitamin D deficiency is treated. Thus far, any protective effect of vitamin D specifically against severe COVID-19 remains unclear. We also emphasize avoiding bolus or extremely high doses of vitamin D, which can increase the risk of intoxication without evidence of benefits.","Santos, Rodrigo Nolasco Dos; Maeda, Sergio Setsuo; Jardim, José Roberto; Lazaretti-Castro, Marise",Archives of endocrinology and metabolism,https://doi.org/10.20945/2359-3997000000291; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32876154/,8
132533,Harnessing Momentum for Cancer Research.,2021-01-05,"INTRODUCTION The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of single-incision laparoscopic surgery for totally extraperitoneal repair (SILS-TEP) of irreducible inguinal hernias and incarcerated inguinal hernias. METHODS We performed a retrospective analysis of 194 patients, including 16 with irreducible or incarcerated hernia, who had undergone SILS-TEP from May 2016 to December 2017 at Kinki Central Hospital. The outcomes of patients with irreducible or incarcerated hernia and those with reducible hernia were compared. For irreducible or incarcerated hernia, laparoscopic exploration with hernia reduction through an intraumbilical incision was performed. If no bowel resection was needed, one-stage SILS-TEP was performed. If bowel resection was required, two-stage SILS-TEP was performed 2-3 months after the bowel resection. RESULTS Of the 16 patients, 8 had an irreducible hernia, and 8 had an incarcerated hernia. The eight patients with an incarcerated hernia underwent emergency surgery, and among these patients, two needed single-incision laparoscopic partial resection of the ileum followed by two-stage SILS-TEP. Fourteen patients, excluding the two patients who required single-incision laparoscopic partial resection of the ileum, underwent laparoscopic exploration with hernia reduction followed by one-stage SILS-TEP. Among these 14 patients, one with an irreducible hernia required conversion to Kugel patch repair. The operative outcomes were generally comparable between the two groups. However, the operative time was longer for unilateral hernia, and more seromas were seen in the irreducible or incarcerated group. No other major complications or cases of hernia recurrence were noted in this study. CONCLUSIONS SILS-TEP, which offers good cosmetic results, can be safely performed for irreducible or incarcerated inguinal hernia.","Wakasugi, Masaki; Nakahara, Yujiro; Hirota, Masaki; Matsumoto, Takashi; Takemoto, Hiroyoshi; Takachi, Ko; Nishioka, Kiyonori; Oshima, Satoshi",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ases.12488; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29696790/,8

At the healthcare level there is the risk that nosocomial outbreaks can be local amplifiers. Adequate infection control practices are of critical importance, which include proper use of personal protective equipment. This equipment must be appropriate to the pathogen transmission route that, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, occurs through droplet and contact routes. The infected individual, when talking, coughing or sneezing, spreads droplets containing the virus, directly contaminating other individuals within one to two meters of distance, as well as the surrounding environment. Airborne transmission may occur when aerosol-generating procedures are performed. Concerning respiratory protection, there is currently weak evidence that the use of respirators provides better protection than surgical masks for SARS-CoV-2 or other viruses (with the exception of aerosol-generating procedures, in which case the use of a respirator is recommended). Eye protection should be guaranteed whenever there is a risk of splashes, droplets or aerosols. The use of different, or higher than necessary, level of personal protective equipment, for the transmission route of the agent, is a form of misuse and can affect its supply for situations when it is clearly indicated. The adequate provision of protective equipment, as well as training of healthcare professionals in its correct use, is highly recommended to ensure safety of care.","Peres, David; Boléo-Tomé, José Pedro; Santos, Gilda",Acta medica portuguesa,https://doi.org/10.20344/amp.14108; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32568064/,8

The overall quality of medical research remains poor, despite longstanding criticisms. The problems are well known, but the research community fails to properly address them. We suggest most problems stem from an underlying paradox: although methodology is undeniably the backbone of qualitative and responsible research, science consistently undervalues methodology. The focus remains more on the destination (research claims and metrics) than on the journey. Notwithstanding, research should serve society more than the reputation of those involved. While we notice that many initiatives are being established to improve components of the research cycle, these initiatives are too disjointed. The overall system is monolithic and slow to adapt. We assert that a top-down action is needed from journals, universities, funders and governments to break the cycle and put methodology first. These actions should involve the widespread adoption of registered reports, balanced research funding between innovative, incremental and methodological research projects, full recognition and demystification of peer review, mandatory statistical review of reports, adherence to reporting guidelines, and investment in methodological education and research.

134213,Coronavirus disinfection in histopathology.,2020-03-01,"Purpose Over the last two decades, the number of Americans misusing opioids has reached epidemic levels. With such drastic increases in opioid misuse, audiologists are more likely to have patients with opioid-induced hearing loss or neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) than in previous years. More attention is needed on how these increases might influence clinical practice and such a discussion could be useful for audiologists. The goal of this article, therefore, is to summarize what is currently known regarding the relationship between opioid misuse and audiology to help guide hearing health care providers (with a particular focus on opioid-induced hearing loss and NAS). This article (a) summarizes the overlap in opioid misuse and hearing loss populations, (b) describes the evidence linking opioid misuse to hearing loss, (c) discusses clinical implications that opioid-induced hearing loss and NAS have for practicing audiologists, and (d) recommends directions for future audiological research on opioid-induced hearing loss and NAS. Conclusions There is considerable overlap between populations at-risk for hearing loss and opioid misuse. Additionally, compelling evidence exists linking opioid misuse to hearing loss, but the specific causal mechanisms remain unclear, indicating a need for additional research. This article attempts to fill a gap in the audiological literature and has the potential to serve as a guide for hearing health care providers to make more informed clinical decisions regarding patients with opioid-induced hearing loss and NAS. Clinicians may wish to consider the concerns raised in this article before intervening with such concerns, especially in the absence of best practice protocols.","Rigg, Khary K; Rigg, Malika S",American journal of audiology,https://doi.org/10.1044/2020_aja-20-00054; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33115245/,8
134276,Detection and identification of oral anaerobes in intraoperative bronchial fluids of patients with pulmonary carcinoma.,2014,"ABSTRACT Neutral electrolyzed water (NEW) is an oxidizing sanitizer that can be made locally on-site; it is often stored in a ready-to-use format to accumulate the large volumes required for periodic or seasonal use. The shelf stability of NEW sanitizer was, therefore, assessed under various storage conditions to guide the development of protocols for its industrial application. To that end, fresh NEW with an available chlorine concentration (ACC) of 480 mg/L, pH 6.96, and oxidation reduction potential (ORP) of 916 mV was stored under different conditions. These were open or sealed polypropylene bottles, three different surface area-to-volume (SA:V) ratios (0.9, 1.7, and 8.7), and two temperatures (4 and 25°C). NEW stored at 4°C was significantly more stable than NEW stored at 25°C; ACC and pH decreased by 137 mg/L and 0.7, respectively, whereas ORP increased by 23 mV, after 101 days of storage. At 25°C, ACC decreased to <0.01 mg/L after 52 days in bottles with a SA:V ratio of 8.7, with a similar decrease after 101 days in bottles with a SA:V ratio of 1.7. However, pH decreased by up to 3.7 pH units, and ORP increased by up to 208 mV. The antimicrobial efficacy of ""aged"" electrolyzed oxidizing (EO) water with different ACC and ORP, but the same pH (i.e., 3.4 ± 0.2), was evaluated against Escherichia coli and Listeria innocua to determine any differences in residual antimicrobial activity. EO water with an ACC of ≥7 mg/L and an ORP of 1,094 mV caused a reduction of at least 4.7 log, whereas EO water with nondetectable ACC and considerably high ORP (716 mV) had little antimicrobial effect (<1-log reduction). Results from this study indicate that the efficacy of NEW as a sanitizer for large-scale applications such as horticulture can be maintained for at least 3 months when it is stored in closed containers with low SA:V ratio at low temperatures.

134986,Toward a quantitative method for estimating tumour-stroma ratio in breast cancer using polarized light microscopy.,2021-06-01,"OBJECTIVE This study examines the media use of children from low-income homes during school closings during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Caregivers of 151 kindergarteners from low-income homes completed questionnaires as part of a larger study. Caregivers reported how much time children spent watching television/videos and using apps on the most recent weekday and weekend days. Caregivers also reported how their child's current use of media for several different purposes compared with how much the child usually uses media for that purpose. RESULTS Weekly average media use was 46.3 hours or 6.6 hours per day. Counter to previous research, weekday media use was higher than weekend media use, suggesting that media was likely used as a replacement for time usually spent in school. Caregivers reported increased child media use for positive purposes, such as education and maintaining relationships with family and friends outside of the home, and potentially useful but less socially valued purposes, such as occupying the child's time while caregivers were completing other tasks. Having more children in the household was related to higher media use, and girls used media for maintaining remote relationships more than boys. CONCLUSION These findings provide reason for both concern and optimism for the impacts of pandemic closures on low-income children. High levels of media use seem to be prevalent in this population. However, the diverse purposes for media use suggest that caregivers relied on media to supplement children's academic and social growth at a time when school and socializing were not safe in their typical forms.","Dore, Rebecca A; Purtell, Kelly M; Justice, Laura M",Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP,https://doi.org/10.1097/dbp.0000000000000955; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33843804/,8
135182,Efficient whole brain transduction by systemic infusion of minimally purified AAV-PHP.eB.,2020-08-15,"Objective To (1) compare physiologic changes during rigid bronchoscopy during spontaneous and mechanical ventilation and (2) evaluate the efficacy of a helium-oxygen (heliox) gas mixture as compared with room air during rigid bronchoscopy. Study Design Crossover animal study evaluating physiologic parameters during rigid bronchoscopy. Outcomes were compared with predicted computational fluid analysis. Setting Simulated ventilation via computational fluid dynamics analysis and term lambs undergoing rigid bronchoscopy. Methods Respiratory and physiologic outcomes were analyzed in a lamb model simulating bronchoscopy during foreign body aspiration to compare heliox with room air. The main outcome measures were blood oxygen saturation, heart rate, blood pressure, partial pressure of oxygen, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Computational fluid dynamics analysis was performed with SOLIDWORKS within a rigid pediatric bronchoscope during simulated ventilation comparing heliox with room air. Results For room air, lambs desaturated within 3 minutes during mechanical ventilation versus normal oxygen saturation during spontaneous ventilation ( P = .01). No improvement in respiratory outcomes was seen between heliox and room air during mechanical ventilation. Computational fluid dynamics analysis demonstrates increased turbulence within size 3.5 bronchoscopes when comparing heliox and room air. Meaningful comparisons could not be made due to the intolerance of the lambs to heliox in vivo. Conclusion During mechanical ventilation on room air, lambs desaturate more quickly during rigid bronchoscopy on settings that should be adequate. Heliox does not improve ventilation during rigid bronchoscopy.","Sowder, Justin C; Dahl, Mar Janna; Zuspan, Kaitlin R; Albertine, Kurt H; Null, Donald M; Barneck, Mitchell D; Grimmer, J Fredrik",Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery,https://doi.org/10.1177/0194599818763067; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29512419/,8

METHODS Data was collected by chart review on six patients who underwent extralevator excision with gracilis flap reconstruction from 10/2013 to 06/2015. Technical details, operative data, oncologic outcomes, and wound healing complications were evaluated. RESULTS There were no instances of intraoperative perforation or positive circumferential resection margin, and one case of locoregional recurrence. Two patients experienced flap venous congestion and one patient developed a perineal abscess. All patients went on to complete healing. CONCLUSIONS The combination of a minimally invasive robotic assisted extralevator abdominoperineal excision performed in the modified Lloyd-Davis position with reconstruction of the perineum with pedicled gracilis flaps has excellent oncologic outcomes and acceptable wound healing complications.

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) enters the human cell after binding to the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 receptors, that are present in various organs. The involvement of the respiratory system is common and may progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Besides the involvement of respiratory system other systems like cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal and central nervous are not uncommon. In-depth understanding of the pathophysiological basis of organs and systems involvement and disease progression aids in the safe and effective management of the COVID-19 patients. It also helps to guide future well-designed clinical trials, which is the need of time. This review aims to explore the current understanding of pathophysiological basis of various organ system involvement in patients with COVID-19, that can have relevance for patient management and future research. We reviewed the articles in various databases to assemble the current evidences.

136596,Clinical practice. Small renal mass.,2010,"The development of new diagnostic methods based on molecular biology has led to evidence of the important role of respiratory viruses in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. Cytokines and chemokines are recognized as key actors in the pathogenesis of COPD. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between viral infection and host cytokine responses in 57 COPD patients hospitalized with an acute exacerbation. Seventeen cytokines were profiled using a Luminex-Biorad multiplex assay in plasma samples collected in the first 24 h following hospital admission. Stepwise linear regression analysis was performed, taking into account the influence of seven potential confounding factors in the results. Twenty-four out of 57 showed radiological signs of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) at hospital admission, 25 patients required admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), 20 had a bacterial infection, and 20 showed a detectable respiratory virus in pharyngeal swabs. Regression analysis showed that viral infection correlated with higher levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) (log value of the coefficient of regression B, p=0.47, 0.044), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (p=0.43, 0.019), and increased admission to the ICU. Viral infection also correlated with higher levels of interferon-γ (IFN-γ) (p=0.70, 0.026), which, in turn, was inversely associated with the severity of illness. Finally, viral infection was independently associated with higher levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (p=0.40, 0.002). Thus our study demonstrates that in patients with COPD exacerbations, viral infection is directly associated with higher systemic levels of cytokines central to the development of the antiviral response, which are also known to contribute to inflammation-mediated tissue damage. These results reveal a potential specific role of viral infection in the pathogenesis of COPD exacerbations.","Almansa, Raquel; Socias, Lorenzo; Andaluz-Ojeda, David; Martín-Loeches, Ignacio; Bobillo, Felipe; Blanco, Jesús; Rico, Lucia; Berezo, Jose Ángel; Estella, Ángel; Sanchez-Garcia, Monica; San José, Alicia; Herrero, Agueda; Justel, Mar; Roig, Vicente; Del Olmo, Milagros; Rosich, Sara; Rodriguez, Irene; Disdier, Carlos; Eiros, Jose María; Ortiz De Lejarazu, Raúl; Bermejo-Martin, Jesus F",Viral immunology,https://doi.org/10.1089/vim.2011.0095; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22746693/,8
136742,Predictors of Palliative Care Knowledge: Findings from the Health Information National Trends Survey.,2021-06-04,"Our aim is to evaluate and compare the most discussed articles on osteoporosis in academia and social media. The treatment of osteoporosis was the most popular topic in the top 100 citation (n = 31) and altmetric lists (n = 47). The general public, as well as academia, is curious about the treatment of osteoporosis. PURPOSE The main aim of this study is to investigate the trends in the field of osteoporosis and guide researchers by conducting bibliometric and altmetric analysis for osteoporosis with the most cited and discussed articles on social media. METHODS The keyword ""osteoporosis"" was searched from the Web of Science All Databases and Altmetric.com website, and the top 100 (T100) citation and altmetric list was created, respectively. The T100 citation and altmetric list articles were analyzed and compared in terms of study type, topic of study, first author, publication year, citation number, journal quartile in category, impact factor, and Altmetric Attention Score (AAS). RESULTS T100 cited articles: the median for citation number was 1117 (range: 717-3854) and the median for AAS was 9 (range: 0-371). T100 altmetric articles: the AAS median was 158 (range: 93-658) and citation number median was 31 (range: 0-2132). Only 6 articles were the same in both lists. The number of articles about treatment was 31 in the T100 citation list and 47 in the T100 altmetric list. The most ranked journals were ""The New England Journal of Medicine"" with 22 articles in the T100 citation list and ""Osteoporosis International"" with 16 articles in the T100 altmetric list.

Despite the emerging nature of A/H5N1, there is limited research on public knowledge and perceptions of this disease. This study is based on a computer-assisted telephone interviewing survey conducted in May 2006 to determine the Australian public's knowledge of A/H5N1, their willingness to engage in preventive behaviors, and their acceptance of potential messages for communication campaigns. Awareness and concern about bird flu is low (lower than a recent survey of U.S. residents). There appears to be widespread support for bird flu control measures initiated by the federal government, although less agreement regarding personal protective behaviors.

137536,Evolving therapeutic goals in ulcerative colitis: towards disease clearance.,2019,"A complex intracellular signaling governs different cellular responses in inflammation. Extracellular stimuli are sensed, amplified, and transduced through a dynamic cellular network of messengers converting the first signal into a proper response: production of specific mediators, cell activation, survival, or death. Several overlapping pathways are coordinated to ensure specific and timely induction of inflammation to neutralize potential harms to the tissue. Ideally, the inflammatory response must be controlled and self-limited. Resolution of inflammation is an active process that culminates with termination of inflammation and restoration of tissue homeostasis. Comparably to the onset of inflammation, resolution responses are triggered by coordinated intracellular signaling pathways that transduce the message to the nucleus. However, the key messengers and pathways involved in signaling transduction for resolution are still poorly understood in comparison to the inflammatory network. cAMP has long been recognized as an inducer of anti-inflammatory responses and cAMP-dependent pathways have been extensively exploited pharmacologically to treat inflammatory diseases. Recently, cAMP has been pointed out as coordinator of key steps of resolution of inflammation. Here, we summarize the evidence for the role of cAMP at inducing important features of resolution of inflammation.","Tavares, Luciana P; Negreiros-Lima, Graziele L; Lima, Kátia M; R E Silva, Patrícia M; Pinho, Vanessa; Teixeira, Mauro M; de Sousa, Lirlândia P",Pharmacological research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2020.105030; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32562817/,8
137667,COVID-19 antibody development fueled by HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibody research.,2020-11-21,"OBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to compare the number of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) cases during the quarantine period for COVID-19 to that of the last year. METHODS This study was conducted as a single-center and retrospective study. All hospital admissions during April 2020 and May 2020 were screened from the hospital records, and DVT cases were recorded. Likewise, all hospital admissions during April 2019 and May 2019 were screened, and DVT cases were noted. DVT cases of both years were compared. RESULTS Among 480931 patients admitted to our hospital in April 2019 and May 2019, DVT was detected in 82 patients (0.017%) (47 males, 35 females) with a mean age of 56.99 ± 9.1 years (ranges 39 to 79 years). Besides, among 145101 patients admitted to our hospital in April 2020 and May 2020, DVT was detected in 123 patients (0.084%) (51 males, 72 females) with a mean age of 58.64 ± 8.9 years (ranges 40 to 83 years). Despite the decrease in the total number of patients admitted to the hospital, there was a significant increase in the number of DVT patients. Interestingly, there were only two symptomatic pulmonary-embolism cases in the 2019 period, whereas there were seven symptomatic pulmonary embolisms secondary to DVT in the 2020 period. Unfortunately, one patient died due to pulmonary embolism secondary to DVT in 2020. The previous history of DVT was remarkable in patients admitted during the COVID-19 confinement. CONCLUSION In conclusion, COVID-19 confinement seems to be associated with increased rates of DVT. Strict preventive measures such as exercise training or prophylactic drug use should be considered to prevent immobility-related DVT during the COVID-19 quarantine.","Karaali, Evren; Çiloğlu, Osman; Demirtürk, Orhan Saim; Keklikçioğlu, Burak; Akçay, İsmail; Ekiz, Timur",Phlebology,https://doi.org/10.1177/0268355520977294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33287673/,8

This study compared an absorbable barbed suture device to a monofilament suture in a single-layer enterotomy closure model. METHODS A series of 10 enterotomies were created in the stomach, jejunum, and colon through midline laparotomy in 13 mongrels. The enterotomies were closed in a simple continuous pattern and randomized to either conventional suture secured with three square knots or a barbed suture device without knots. Closure time was recorded for each sample. Adhesion scores and biomechanical wound strengths were assessed at postoperative days 3, 10, and 21 by burst pressure testing. RESULTS Barbed suture provided a faster closure compared to conventional suture (p ≤ .02). There was no significant difference in burst pressures or adhesion scores between barbed suture and monofilament suture enterotomy closures at day 3, 10, or 21. CONCLUSION Enterotomy closure was faster using the barbed device as compared to conventional suture, with no significant difference in burst strength or adhesion scores at any time point.","Miller, Jeffrey; Zaruby, Jeffrey; Kaminskaya, Kristina",Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,https://doi.org/10.3109/08941939.2011.603818; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22439837/,8

Methods Secondary analysis of a multinational, cohort study on all consecutive pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 from February 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020 from 73 centers from 22 different countries. A confirmed case of COVID-19 was defined as a positive result on real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR) assay of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens. The primary outcome was a composite adverse fetal outcome, defined as the presence of either abortion (pregnancy loss before 22 weeks of gestations), stillbirth (intrauterine fetal death after 22 weeks of gestation), neonatal death (death of a live-born infant within the first 28 days of life), and perinatal death (either stillbirth or neonatal death). Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate parameters independently associated with the primary outcome. Logistic regression was reported as odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results Mean gestational age at diagnosis was 30.6±9.5 weeks, with 8.0% of women being diagnosed in the first, 22.2% in the second and 69.8% in the third trimester of pregnancy. There were six miscarriage (2.3%), six intrauterine device (IUD) (2.3) and 5 (2.0%) neonatal deaths, with an overall rate of perinatal death of 4.2% (11/265), thus resulting into 17 cases experiencing and 226 not experiencing composite adverse fetal outcome. Neither stillbirths nor neonatal deaths had congenital anomalies found at antenatal or postnatal evaluation. Furthermore, none of the cases experiencing IUD had signs of impending demise at arterial or venous Doppler. Neonatal deaths were all considered as prematurity-related adverse events. Of the 250 live-born neonates, one (0.4%) was found positive at RT-PCR pharyngeal swabs performed after delivery. The mother was tested positive during the third trimester of pregnancy. The newborn was asymptomatic and had negative RT-PCR test after 14 days of life. At logistic regression analysis, gestational age at diagnosis (OR: 0.85, 95% CI 0.8-0.9 per week increase; p<0.001), birthweight (OR: 1.17, 95% CI 1.09-1.12.7 per 100 g decrease; p=0.012) and maternal ventilatory support, including either need for oxygen or CPAP (OR: 4.12, 95% CI 2.3-7.9; p=0.001) were independently associated with composite adverse fetal outcome. Conclusions Early gestational age at infection, maternal ventilatory supports and low birthweight are the main determinants of adverse perinatal outcomes in fetuses with maternal COVID-19 infection. Conversely, the risk of vertical transmission seems negligible.","Di Mascio, Daniele; Sen, Cihat; Saccone, Gabriele; Galindo, Alberto; Grünebaum, Amos; Yoshimatsu, Jun; Stanojevic, Milan; Kurjak, Asım; Chervenak, Frank; Rodríguez Suárez, María José; Gambacorti-Passerini, Zita Maria; Baz, María de Los Angeles Anaya; Aguilar Galán, Esther Vanessa; López, Yolanda Cuñarro; De León Luis, Juan Antonio; Hernández, Ignacio Cueto; Herraiz, Ignacio; Villalain, Cecilia; Venturella, Roberta; Rizzo, Giuseppe; Mappa, Ilenia; Gerosolima, Giovanni; Hellmeyer, Lars; Königbauer, Josefine; Ameli, Giada; Frusca, Tiziana; Volpe, Nicola; Luca Schera, Giovanni Battista; Fieni, Stefania; Esposito, Eutalia; Simonazzi, Giuliana; Di Donna, Gaetana; Youssef, Aly; Della Gatta, Anna Nunzia; Di Donna, Mariano Catello; Chiantera, Vito; Buono, Natalina; Sozzi, Giulio; Greco, Pantaleo; Morano, Danila; Bianchi, Beatrice; Lombana Marino, Maria Giulia; Laraud, Federica; Ramone, Arianna; Cagnacci, Angelo; Barra, Fabio; Gustavino, Claudio; Ferrero, Simone; Ghezzi, Fabio; Cromi, Antonella; Laganà, Antonio Simone; Longo, Valentina Laurita; Stollagli, Francesca; Sirico, Angelo; Lanzone, Antonio; Driul, Lorenza; Cecchini D, Fabiana; Xodo, Serena; Rodriguez, Brian; Mercado-Olivares, Felipe; Elkafrawi, Deena; Sisti, Giovanni; Esposito, Rosanna; Coviello, Antonio; Cerbone, Marco; Morlando, Maddalena; Schiattarella, Antonio; Colacurci, Nicola; De Franciscis, Pasquale; Cataneo, Ilaria; Lenzi, Marinella; Sandri, Fabrizio; Buscemi, Riccardo; Gattei, Giorgia; Sala, Francesca Della; Valori, Eleonora; Rovellotti, Maria Cristina; Done, Elisa; Faron, Gilles; Gucciardo, Leonardo; Esposito, Valentina; Vena, Flaminia; Giancotti, Antonella; Brunelli, Roberto; Muzii, Ludovico; Nappi, Luigi; Sorrentino, Felice; Vasciaveo, Lorenzo; Liberati, Marco; Buca, Danilo; Leombroni, Martina; Di Sebastiano, Francesca; Di Tizio, Luciano; Gazzolo, Diego; Franchi, Massimo; Ianniciello, Quintino Cesare; Garzon, Simone; Petriglia, Giuliano; Borrello, Leonardo; Nieto-Calvache, Albaro Josè; Burgos-Luna, Juan Manuel; Kadji, Caroline; Carlin, Andrew; Bevilacqua, Elisa; Moucho, Marina; Pinto, Pedro Viana; Figueiredo, Rita; Roselló, José Morales; Loscalzo, Gabriela; Martinez-Varea, Alicia; Diago, Vincente; Jimenez Lopez, Jesús S; Aykanat, Alicia Yeliz; Cosma, Stefano; Carosso, Andrea; Benedetto, Chiara; Bermejo, Amanda; May Feuerschuette, Otto Henrique; Uyaniklar, Ozlem; Ocakouglu, Sakine Rahimli; Atak, Zeliha; Gündüz, Reyhan; Haberal, Esra Tustas; Froessler, Bernd; Parange, Anupam; Palm, Peter; Samardjiski, Igor; Taccaliti, Chiara; Okuyan, Erhan; Daskalakis, George; Moreira de Sa, Renato Augusto; Pittaro, Alejandro; Gonzalez-Duran, Maria Luisa; Guisan, Ana Concheiro; Genç, Şerife Özlem; Zlatohlávková, Blanka; Piqueras, Anna Luengo; Oliva, Dolores Esteban; Cil, Aylin Pelin; Api, Olus; Antsaklis, Panos; Ples, Liana; Kyvernitakis, Ioannis; Maul, Holger; Malan, Marcel; Lila, Albert; Granese, Roberta; Ercoli, Alfredo; Zoccali, Giuseppe; Villasco, Andrea; Biglia, Nicoletta; Madalina, Ciuhodaru; Costa, Elena; Daelemans, Caroline; Pintiaux, Axelle; Yapar Eyi, Elif Gül; Cueto, Elisa; Hadar, Eran; Dollinger, Sarah; Brzezinski Sinai, Noa A; Huertas, Erasmo; Arango, Pedro; Sanchez, Amadeo; Schvartzman, Javier Alfonso; Cojocaru, Liviu; Turan, Sifa; Turan, Ozhan; Di Dedda, Maria Carmela; Molpeceres, Rebeca Garrote; Zdjelar, Snezana; Premru-Srsen, Tanja; Cerar, Lilijana Kornhauser; Druškovič, Mirjam; De Robertis, Valentina; Stefanovic, Vedran; Nupponen, Irmeli; Nelskylä, Kaisa; Khodjaeva, Zulfiya; Gorina, Ksenia A; Sukhikh, Gennady T; Maruotti, Giuseppe Maria; Visentin, Silvia; Cosmi, Erich; Ferrari, Jacopo; Gatti, Alessandra; Luvero, Daniela; Angioli, Roberto; Puri, Ludovica; Palumbo, Marco; D'Urso, Giusella; Colaleo, Francesco; Chiara Rapisarda, Agnese Maria; Carbone, Ilma Floriana; Mollo, Antonio; Nazzaro, Giovanni; Locci, Mariavittoria; Guida, Maurizio; Di Spiezio Sardo, Attilio; Panici, Pierluigi Benedetti; Berghella, Vincenzo; Flacco, Maria Elena; Manzoli, Lamberto; Bifulco, Giuseppe; Scambia, Giovanni; Zullo, Fulvio; D'Antonio, Francesco",Journal of perinatal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2020-0355; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32975205/,8

To describe the route of hysterectomy in a county hospital and evaluate the shift towards a minimal invasive approach. Design. Retrospective cohort study. Setting. A county hospital in Norway. Population. All women were scheduled for hysterectomy. Methods. Audit the route of hysterectomy in the period 2004-2012. Analyze the outcome of total laparoscopic hysterectomies. Main Outcome Measures. Complications after total laparoscopic hysterectomy. Results. A shift towards a minimal invasive approach has been achieved during the study period. In 2012 only 17.4% of the hysterectomies were performed abdominally, compared to yearly percentages of above 50% in the period 2004-2009. Laparoscopic supracervical hysterectomy was introduced in 2003, but the percentage of abdominal hysterectomy remained above 50% until total laparoscopic hysterectomy was introduced in 2010. Since the introduction of total laparoscopic hysterectomy in April 2010, 58 procedures have been performed. There have been no major complications. Two vaginal vault hematomas and one case of urinary tract infection were reported. Conclusions. It is possible for a county hospital to alter their praxis and perform mini-invasive hysterectomies, but it requires dedicated gynecologists. This change to an advanced procedure like total laparoscopic hysterectomy could be achieved without patients suffering from major complications.","Hoyer-Sorensen, Christian; Hortemo, Sigurd; Lieng, Marit",ISRN obstetrics and gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/249357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23762574/,8

When classified by the reported codes, the C-type waste (infectious waste) accounted for about 89% of the reported quantities, which indicated an annual increase by 4.14% during the same period. In addition, the medical waste treatment in 2019 was mainly dependent on the commissioned treatment (80.18%), followed by the recycling (18.53%) and the self-treatment (1.29%). Furthermore, the impact of COVID-19 on the medical waste generation in Taiwan was not significant in the first half of 2020 compared to the data during the years of 2016-2019. It was indicated that the consistent trend was observed at the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in Taiwan during this period. Obviously, the reduction in the hospital medical services during the COVID-19 outbreak should be offset by the increase in medical waste generation from the medical services. In order to try to ensure safe and complete destruction of the COVID-19 virus, all the waste generated from the healthcare facilities should be treated in the incineration plants.","Tsai, Wen-Tien","Waste management & research : the journal of the International Solid Wastes and Public Cleansing Association, ISWA",https://doi.org/10.1177/0734242x21996803; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33666120/,8

Yield potential and genotypic adaptability are important factors in varietal development. The purpose of this study was to estimate the stability of yield and to select the best OFSP genotypes across three agroecosystems in West Java, Indonesia. The field trials used were augmented design with 50 F1 Orange-Fleshed Sweet Potato (OFSP) genotypes as treatment, and seven check varieties as controls. The experiments were conducted in three different agroecosystems in West Java (Sumedang, Bandung, and Karawang). Selection was based on physical characteristics of sweet potato tuber, yield and stability across three environments. Data analysis of the yield characters, yield component, and tuber quality were performed by combined variance analysis. Selected genotypes were analyzed for stability yield using the parametric, non-parametric, Additive Main effects and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI), AMMI Stability Value (ASV), and Genotype and Genotype by Environment (GGE) biplot models. Results identified the top best ten F1 genotypes namely F1-38 (G1), F1-69 (G2), F1-71 (G3), F1-77 (G4), F1-127 (G5), F1-128 (G6), F1-135 (G7), F1-159 (G8), F1-191 (G9), and F1-226 (G10). Location showed a significant effect on yield. Genotypes F1-069, F1-077, F1-226, F1-038, and F1-128 have the lowest ASR based on non-parametric and parametric stability models and there were identified as the most stable. AMMI analysis identified F1-128, F1-135, F1-038, and F1-069 as the most stable genotypes. F1-38 (G1), F1-69 (G2), F1-128 (G6) were found to be the most stable genotypes based on ASV analysis, while GGE biplot identified F1-38 (G1) and F1-69 (G2) genotypes as the stable genotypes. Other genotypes were considered to as location-specific. Based on AMMI, ASV, and GGE Biplot models, F1-038, and F1-069 were identified as stable genotypes. They produced higher yields than other genotypes. Therefore, the F1-038 and F1-069 genotypes can be potentially recommended as superior varieties for West Java, Indonesia.","Karuniawan, Agung; Maulana, Haris; Ustari, Debby; Dewayani, Sitaresmi; Solihin, Eso; Solihin, M Amir; Amien, Suseno; Arifin, Mahfud",Heliyon,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06881; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34007919/,8

To overcome these difficulties, we used the EndoStitch to create the purse-string suture and the ENDOCAMELEON to create the visual field to stretch the jejunum. After resecting the esophagus, purse-string sutures were placed using the EndoStitch. A total of five to six needle deliveries were performed. Next, the anvil head was inserted into the esophagus. The main unit of the EEA was inserted from the end of the resected jejunum. Then, the scope was changed to the ENDOCAMELEON. The main unit was slowly moved toward the anvil head. After making sure that the mesentery and the wall of the jejunum on the mesenteric side were not rolled into the anastomosis under the visual field created by the ENDOCAMELEON, the main unit was then fired. Thereafter, esophagojejunostomy was successfully completed. This technique was applied in 20 patients between April 2010 and May 2012. Laparoscopic esophagojejunostomy after total gastrectomy for gastric cancer was completed in all 20 patients. No case required conversion to open surgery. Neither anastomotic leakage nor stenosis was observed. This method is simple and useful for laparoscopic esophagojejunostomy after total gastrectomy for gastric cancer.","Yoshikawa, Takaki; Hayashi, Tsutomu; Aoyama, Toru; Cho, Haruhiko; Fujikawa, Hirohito; Shirai, Junya; Hasegawa, Shinichi; Yamada, Takanobu; Oshima, Takashi; Yukawa, Norio; Rino, Yasushi; Masuda, Munetaka; Ogata, Takashi; Tsuburaya, Akira",Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10120-012-0211-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23179367/,8
139558,Pulmonary resections: cytostructural effects of different-wavelength lasers versus electrocautery.,2012,"Polarization of macrophages to different functional states is important for mounting responses against pathogen infections. Macrophages are the major target cells of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), which is the primary causative agent of porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD) leading to immense economic losses in the global swine industry. Clinically, PCV2 is often found to increase risk of other pathogenic infections yet the underlying mechanisms remain to be elusive. Here we found that PCV2 infection skewed macrophages toward a M1 status through reprogramming expression of a subset of M1-associated genes and M2-associated genes. Mechanistically, induction of M1-associated genes by PCV2 infection is dependent on activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways whereas suppression of M2-associated genes by PCV2 is via inhibiting expression of jumonji domain containing-3 (JMJD3), a histone 3 Lys27 (H3K27) demethylase that regulates M2 activation of macrophages. Finally, we identified that PCV2 capsid protein (Cap) directly inhibits JMJD3 transcription to restrain expression of interferon regulatory factor (IRF4) that controls M2 macrophage polarization. Consequently, sustained infection of PCV2 facilitates bacterial infection in vitro. In summary, these findings showed that PCV2 infection functionally modulated M1 macrophage polarization via targeting canonical signals and epigenetic histone modification, which contributes to bacterial coinfection and virial pathogenesis.","Zhang, Wen; Fu, Zhendong; Yin, Hongyan; Han, Qingbing; Fan, Wenhui; Wang, Fangkun; Shang, Yingli",Frontiers in immunology,https://doi.org/10.3389/fimmu.2021.688294; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34394082/,8

In this study, we aim to investigate the role of renal regional oxygen saturation (rSO2 ) reductions in predicting AKI in the first 24 hours of life. METHODS One-hundred premature babies with a gestational age of ≤32 weeks were included. Renal and cerebral rSO2 s were monitored for 24 hours by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Infants were followed up for the first 7 days for the diagnosis of AKI. RESULTS Infants' median gestational age was 29 (23-32) weeks, and their birth weight was 1192 ± 355 g. It was found that the renal rSO2 values were lower in the first 24 hours of life in patients who developed AKI, and this decrease was statistically significant in the first 6 hours of life. CONCLUSION The low renal rSO2 values in the early hours of life in premature babies may have a role in predicting AKI.","Dorum, Bayram Ali; Ozkan, Hilal; Cetinkaya, Merih; Koksal, Nilgun",Pediatrics international : official journal of the Japan Pediatric Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/ped.14377; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32634851/,8

This report presents an effective method of anal lavage and excision in laparoscopic low anterior resection. METHODS The authors developed clamp forceps for intestinal lavage and a Y-shaped vinyl hood that can be operated under pneumoperitoneum for airproof surgery. These devices enabled secure clamping and cleansing of the area and use of automatic suture instruments for open laparotomy through a minilaparotomy wound. The authors called this technique the Y-Hood method and compared its short-term results from May 2005 to October 2008 (n = 28) with those for double-stapling technique surgical cases between September 2000 and October 2008 in which automatic suture instruments were used more than once (n = 107). A multivariate analysis of risk factors for anastomotic leakage also was performed. RESULTS No difference in background factors such as patient sex, age, and tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging were detected. Anastomotic leakage was found in 12 cases that used multiple stapling for rectal transection (11.2%) and 2 cases that used the Y-Hood (7.1%). The cost for rectectomy was 92,505 yen for multiple stapling and 53,107 yen for the Y-Hood (p < 0.0001). As risk factors for anastomotic leakage, multivariate analysis identified the number of times stapling for rectal transection was performed and the height of the anastomotic region. CONCLUSION The Y-Hood method enables operations to be performed within the interior of the pelvis without reducing the number of ports because the instruments can be accessed using minilaparotomy. Because the use of stapling for rectal transection is minimized, this method is effective in avoiding anastomotic leakage and also cost efficient. The Y-Hood method allows for thorough intestinal lavage and safe laparoscopic low anterior resection.","Fujii, Shoichi; Ota, Mitsuyoshi; Yamagishi, Shigeru; Kunisaki, Chikara; Osada, Shunichi; Suwa, Hirokazu; Ichikawa, Yasushi; Shimada, Hiroshi",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-009-0564-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19517166/,8

141518,Anaesthetic effects in the ferret of alfaxalone alone and in combination with medetomidine or tramadol: a pilot study.,2014,"The newly emerged human coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a pandemic of respiratory illness. Current evidence suggests that severe cases of SARS-CoV-2 are associated with a dysregulated immune response. However, little is known about how the innate immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2. Here, we modeled SARS-CoV-2 infection using primary human airway epithelial (pHAE) cultures, which are maintained in an air-liquid interface. We found that SARS-CoV-2 infects and replicates in pHAE cultures and is directionally released on the apical, but not basolateral surface. Transcriptional profiling studies found that infected pHAE cultures had a molecular signature dominated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokine induction, including IL-6, TNFα, CXCL8, and identified NF-κB and ATF-4 as key drivers of this pro-inflammatory cytokine response. Surprisingly, we observed a complete lack of a type I or III interferon (IFN) response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, pre-treatment and post-treatment with type I and III IFNs significantly reduced virus replication in pHAE cultures that correlated with upregulation of antiviral effector genes. Combined, our findings demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 does not trigger an IFN response but is sensitive to the effects of type I and III IFNs. Our studies demonstrate the utility of pHAE cultures to model SARS-CoV-2 infection and that both type I and III IFNs can serve as therapeutic options to treat COVID-19 patients.IMPORTANCE The current pandemic of respiratory illness, COVID-19, is caused by a recently emerged coronavirus named SARS-CoV-2. This virus infects airway and lung cells causing fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. Severe cases of COVID-19 can result in lung damage, low blood oxygen levels, and even death. As there are currently no vaccines approved for use in humans, studies of the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 infection are urgently needed. Our research identifies an excellent system to model SARS-CoV-2 infection of the human airways, that can be used to test various treatments. Analysis of infection in this model system found that human airway epithelial cultures induce a strong pro-inflammatory cytokine response yet block the production of type I and III IFNs. to SARS-CoV-2. However, treatment of airway cultures with the immune molecules, type I or type III interferon (IFN) was able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, our model system identified type I or type III IFN as potential antiviral treatments for COVID-19 patients.","Vanderheiden, Abigail; Ralfs, Philipp; Chirkova, Tatiana; Upadhyay, Amit A; Zimmerman, Matthew G; Bedoya, Shamika; Aoued, Hadj; Tharp, Gregory M; Pellegrini, Kathryn L; Manfredi, Candela; Sorscher, Eric; Mainou, Bernardo; Lobby, Jenna L; Kohlmeier, Jacob E; Lowen, Anice C; Shi, Pei-Yong; Menachery, Vineet D; Anderson, Larry J; Grakoui, Arash; Bosinger, Steven E; Suthar, Mehul S",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00985-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32699094/,8

Little is known about factors determining AVM rupture and appropriate treatment strategies to prevent hemorrhage and associated disability. Available data suggest that children are subject to an increased risk for AVM rupture compared with adults. METHODS In 46 pediatric patients with AVM, demographic factors, clinical presentation, angioarchitectural features, and treatment regimens as well as clinical and radiologic outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. First-line treatment option was microsurgical resection of the disease, with or without preoperative embolization. RESULTS Twenty-four boys (52.2%) and 22 girls (47.8%) with a mean age on admission of 12.4 years (4-18 years) were included. Mean follow-up was 4 years (median, 1.5; range, 0.1-16.4). Thirty-one children presented with intracerebral hemorrhage (67.4%). Small AVMs (<3 cm) ruptured in 83.3% (n = 25) and were shown to be more prone to hemorrhage than larger ones (P < 0.01). Small AVM size (P < 0.01; odds ratio [OR], 0.12; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.02-0.59) and exclusive deep venous drainage (P < 0.01; OR, 29.74; 95% CI, 2.45-4445.34) were independent risk factors for hemorrhage in the presented cohort. Good long-term outcome was associated with a high score on the Glasgow Coma Scale on admittance (P < 0.05; OR, 0.148; 95% CI, 0.03-0.73). CONCLUSIONS Two-thirds of children with AVM are admitted with intracerebral hemorrhage. Microsurgical resection was successful as confirmed by radiologic studies in 95%, and 79.5% of patients presented in a good clinical condition on follow-up (modified Rankin Scale 0 or 1).

Conservative management was considered as an alternative and laparoscopic surgery was indicated following safety recommendations. Surgically operated patients were at higher risk of becoming infected with COVID-19 due to hospital exposure, being more susceptible to complications. Methods: Retrospective cohort-type analytical study that includes patients who were admitted to a private center due to an emergency and who underwent laparoscopic gastrointestinal surgery during the National Health Emergency (group exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic) from March 11, 2020 to June 8, 2020 and were compared with those patients operated between March 11, 2019 and June 8, 2019 (group not exposed to the COVID-19 pandemic). Results: A total of 104 patients were identified, 59 patients operated during the COVID-19 pandemic. All were operated by laparoscopy, both groups with a similar degree of disease severity. There was no mortality or surgical reintervention. No surgeon at the institution was infected with the virus during the study period.

While research has shown that early medical abortion at home is as safe as in a clinical setting, women's experiences in the UK in the light of this change have not yet been investigated. This qualitative research explored the experiences of women in one region of Scotland, UK who accessed early medical abortion with home self-administration of misoprostol. METHODS Qualitative interviews were conducted with 20 women who had recently undergone early medical abortion (≤69 days' gestation) with home self-administration of misoprostol. The data were analysed thematically using an approach informed by the Framework analytic approach. RESULTS Women appreciated the flexibility that home administration of misoprostol offered, including the opportunity to control the timing of the abortion. This was particularly important for women who sought not to disclose the abortion to others. Most women valued being in the comfort and privacy of the home when preparing for self-administration, although a small number highlighted some concerns about being at home. Most women reported that self-administration of misoprostol was straightforward; however, some expressed concerns around assessing whether their experiences were 'normal'. CONCLUSIONS Women welcomed the opportunity for home self-administration of misoprostol. To further improve women's early medical abortion experience we suggest that the legislation be amended so that women can self-administer in an appropriate non-clinical setting, not just their home.","Harden, Jeni; Ancian, Julie; Cameron, Sharon; Boydell, Nicola",BMJ sexual & reproductive health,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjsrh-2020-200661; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32718985/,8

A standardized rectal washout with a reversible colon occlusion device in situ has previously shown potential in reducing peritoneal contamination. The aim of this study was to compare the peritoneal contamination rate and inflammatory reaction for transrectal cholecystectomy after ideal rectal preparation (trCCE) and standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy (lapCCE) in a porcine survival experiment. METHODS Twenty pigs were randomized to trCCE (n = 10) or lapCCE (n = 10). Before trCCE, rectal washout was performed with saline solution. A colon occlusion device was then inserted and a second washout with povidone-iodine was performed. The perioperative course and the inflammatory reaction (leukocytes, C-reactive protein) were compared. At necropsy, 14 days after surgery the abdominal cavity was screened for infectious complications and peritoneal swabs were obtained for comparison of peritoneal contamination. RESULTS Peritoneal contamination was lower after trCCE than after lapCCE (0/10 vs. 6/10; p = 0.003). No infectious complications were found at necropsy in either group and postoperative complications did not differ (p = 1.0). Immediately after the procedure, leukocytes were higher after lapCCE (17.0 ± 2.7 vs. 14.6 ± 2.3; p = 0.047). Leukocytes and C-reactive protein showed no difference in the further postoperative course. Intraoperative complications and total operation time (trCCE 114 ± 32 vs. 111 ± 27 min; p = 0.921) did not differ, but wound closure took longer for trCCE (31.5 ± 19 vs. 13 ± 5 min; p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS After standardized rectal washout with a colon occlusion device in situ, trCCE was associated without peritoneal contamination and without access-related infectious complications. Based on the findings of this study, a randomized controlled clinical study comparing clinical outcomes of trCCE with lapCCE should be conducted.","Müller, Philip C; Senft, Jonas D; Gath, Philip; Steinemann, Daniel C; Nickel, Felix; Billeter, Adrian T; Müller-Stich, Beat P; Linke, Georg R",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-017-5804-6; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28799061/,8

142525,Use of whole slide imaging (WSI) for distance teaching.,2020-07-09,"Previously, variation in retinal vascular caliber has been reported in association with chronic kidney disease (CKD) but findings remain inconsistent. To help clarify this we conducted individual participant data meta-analysis and aggregate data meta-analysis on summary estimates to evaluate cross-sectional associations between retinal vascular caliber and CKD. A systematic review was performed using Medline and EMBASE for articles published until October 2018. The aggregate analysis used a two-stage approach combining summary estimates from eleven studies (44,803 patients) while the individual participant analysis used a one-stage approach combining raw data from nine studies (33,222 patients). CKD stages 3-5 was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate under 60 mL/min/1.73m2. Retinal arteriolar and venular caliber (central retinal arteriolar and venular equivalent) were assessed from retinal photographs using computer-assisted methods. Logistic regression estimated relative risk of CKD stages 3-5 associated with a 20 μm decrease (approximately one standard deviation) in central retinal arteriolar and venular equivalent. Prevalence of CKD stages 3-5 was 11.2 % of 33,222 and 11.3 % of 44,803 patients in the individual participant and aggregate data analysis, respectively. No significant associations were detected in adjusted analyses between central retinal arteriolar and venular equivalent and CKD stages 3-5 in the aggregate analysis for central retinal arteriolar relative risk (0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.94-1.03); venular equivalent (0.99, 0.95- 1.04) or individual participant central retinal arteriolar (0.99, 0.95-1.04) or venular equivalent (1.01, 0.97-1.05). Thus, meta-analysis provided little evidence to suggest that cross sectional direct measurements of retinal vascular caliber was associated with CKD stages 3-5 in the general population. Hence, meta-analyses of longitudinal studies evaluating the association between retinal parameters and CKD stages 3-5 may be warranted.","Lye, Weng Kit; Paterson, Euan; Patterson, Christopher C; Maxwell, Alexander P; Binte Mohammed Abdul, Riswana Banu; Tai, E Shyong; Cheng, Ching Yu; Kayama, Takamasa; Yamashita, Hidetoshi; Sarnak, Mark; Shlipak, Michael; Matsushita, Kunihiro; Mutlu, Unal; Ikram, Mohammad A; Klaver, Caroline; Kifley, Annette; Mitchell, Paul; Myers, Chelsea; Klein, Barbara E; Klein, Ronald; Wong, Tien Y; Sabanayagam, Charumathi; McKay, Gareth J",Kidney international,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.kint.2020.06.033; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810524/,8

At our institution, routine COVID-19 testing was implemented from 19th of March on to all pregnant women who were admitted for delivery. The purpose of the study was to estimate the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate in our obstetric population admitted for delivery. Mathods Between 19th March and May 4th, 184 pregnant women were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection upon admission. Results Eleven women were positive for SARS-CoV-2, corresponding to a global prevalence of 6.0%. Of these, only two reported symptoms at admission. The prevalence of asymptomatic infection was 4.9%. We report a lower rate of positive cass than other studies. Eighty-two percent of our cases had no symptoms at admission. Conclusions The proportion of asymptomatic infection highlights the importance of universal laboratory screening for all women admitted for delivery as opposed to symptom-based screening.","Figueiredo, Rita; Tavares, Sara; Moucho, Marina; Ramalho, Carla",Journal of perinatal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1515/jpm-2020-0387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33085639/,8
142644,Biomarkers for the clinical development of antiviral therapies.,2021-01-01,"AIM There is growing evidence that laparoscopic ventral rectopexy (LVR) is an effective treatment for pelvic organ prolapse and obstructive defaecation caused by rectocele. LVR is usually performed using synthetic mesh despite concerns about mesh erosion. We present our experience of using a porcine dermal collagen mesh (Permacol™) for LVR, which is the largest such case series to date. METHOD Data on 65 patients were collected prospectively from May 2008 to October 2010. Outcome measures were complications, recurrence, length of hospital stay, patient satisfaction, Wexner constipation score and Wexner incontinence score. Preoperative and postoperative scores were compared using the two-tailed Wilcoxon signed rank test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS There were statistically significant improvements in the Wexner constipation scores at 6 months and 1 year (both P<0.0001) and in faecal incontinence scores at 6 months (P<0.0001) and 1year (P=0.0002). There were no cases of mesh erosion or mesh-related infection in our series. Recurrence of symptoms occurred in two patients (3.1%). Symptoms were rated as much better or better by 93% of patients at 6months and this was sustained at 1year (96%). CONCLUSION In the short term, LVR using biological mesh is safe and as effective as synthetic mesh, with high patient satisfaction. Constipation and faecal incontinence scores were both improved.","Wahed, S; Ahmad, M; Mohiuddin, K; Katory, M; Mercer-Jones, M",Colorectal disease : the official journal of the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1463-1318.2011.02921.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22176656/,8
143030,Endoscopic features and clinical outcomes of cytomegalovirus gastroenterocolitis in immunocompetent patients.,2021-03-18,"INTRODUCTION PJI is the most dramatic complication after joint arthroplasty. In patients with chronic infection, prosthesis exchange is in theory the rule. However, this surgical approach is sometimes not desirable especially in elderly patients with multiple comorbidities, as it could be associated with a dramatic loss of function, reduction of the bone stock, fracture, or peroperative death. We propose here to report different approaches that can help to maintain the function in such patients based on a pathophysiology-, multidisciplinary-, and an experience-based approach. METHODS We describe the different points that are needed to treat such patients: (i) the multidisciplinary care management; (ii) understanding the mechanism of bacterial persistence; (iii) optimization of the conservative surgical approach; (iv) use of suppressive antimicrobial therapy (SAT); (v) implementation of innovative agents that could be used locally to target the biofilm. RESULTS In France, a nation-wide network called CRIOAc has been created and funded by the French Health ministry to manage complex bone and joint infection. Based on the understanding of the complex pathophysiology of PJI, it seems to be feasible to propose conservative surgical treatment such as ""debridement antibiotics and implant retention"" (with or without soft-tissue coverage) followed by SAT to control the disease progression. Finally, there is a rational for the use of particular agents that have the ability to target the bacteria embedded in biofilm such as bacteriophages and phage lysins. DISCUSSION This multistep approach is probably a key determinant to propose innovative management in patients with complex PJI, to improve the outcome. CONCLUSION Conservative treatment has a high potential in patients with chronic PJI for whom explantation is not desirable. The next step will be to evaluate such practices in nation-wide clinical trials.","Ferry, Tristan; Batailler, Cécile; Brosset, Sophie; Kolenda, Camille; Goutelle, Sylvain; Sappey-Marinier, Elliot; Josse, Jérôme; Laurent, Frédéric; Lustig, Sébastien",SICOT-J,https://doi.org/10.1051/sicotj/2020021; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32633714/,8
143065,Drug-drug interactions between salvianolate injection and aspirin based on their metabolic enzymes.,2021-01-02,"NEW FINDINGS What is the central question of this study? Adult survivors of preterm birth without (PRE) and with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have airflow obstruction at rest and significant mechanical ventilatory constraints during exercise compared with those born at full term (CON). Do PRE/BPD have smaller airways, indexed via the dysanapsis ratio, than CON? What is the main finding and its importance? The dysanapsis ratio was significantly smaller in BPD and PRE compared with CON, with BPD having the smallest dysanapsis ratio. These data suggest that airflow obstruction in PRE and BPD might be because of smaller airways than CON. Adult survivors of very preterm birth (≤32 weeks gestational age) without (PRE) and with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) have obstructive lung disease as evidenced by reduced expiratory airflow at rest and have significant mechanical ventilatory constraints during exercise. Airflow obstruction, in any conditions, could be attributable to several factors, including small airways. PRE and/or BPD could have smaller airways than their counterparts born at full term (CON) owing to a greater degree of dysanaptic airway development during the pre- and/or postnatal period. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to compare the dysanapsis ratio (DR), as an index of airway size, between PRE, BPD and CON. To do so, we calculated DR in PRE (n = 21), BPD (n = 14) and CON (n = 34) individuals and examined flow-volume loops at rest and during submaximal exercise. The DR, using multiple estimates of static recoil pressure, was significantly smaller in PRE and BPD (0.16 ± 0.05 and 0.10 ± 0.03 a.u.) compared with CON (0.22 ± 0.04 a.u.; both P < 0.001) and smallest in BPD (P < 0.001). The DR was significantly correlated with peak expiratory airflow at rest (r = 0.42; P < 0.001) and the extent of expiratory flow limitation during exercise (r = 0.60; P < 0.001). Our findings suggest that PRE/BPD might have anatomically smaller airways than CON, which might help to explain their lower expiratory airflow rate at rest and during exercise and further our understanding of the consequences of preterm birth and neonatal O2 therapy.","Duke, Joseph W; Gladstone, Igor M; Sheel, A William; Lovering, Andrew T",Experimental physiology,https://doi.org/10.1113/ep086588; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29193495/,8
143190,Mining the prognostic significance of the GINS2 gene in human breast cancer using bioinformatics analysis.,2020-08-01,"The bone encasing the inner ear, known as the otic capsule, is unique because it remodels little postnatally compared to other bones in the body. Previous studies established that osteoprotegerin (OPG) in the inner ear inhibits otic capsule remodeling. OPG acts as a decoy receptor of receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) to disrupt the interaction between RANKL and RANK, the primary regulators of bone metabolism. Here we studied the expression and function of RANK and RANKL in the murine cochlea. Using a combination of in situ hybridization, real-time quantitative RT-PCR, and western blot, we demonstrate that Rankl and Rank genes and their protein products are expressed in the intracochlear soft tissues and the otic capsule in a developmentally regulated manner. Using a culture of neonatal murine cochlear neurons, we show that the interaction between RANK and RANKL inhibits neurite outgrowth in these neurons, and is associated with upregulation of Nogo-A expression. Taken together, our results suggest that, in addition to regulating otic capsule bone remodeling, RANK and RANKL expressed by intracochlear soft tissues may also regulate spiral ganglion neuron function by affecting neurite outgrowth.","Kao, Shyan-Yuan; Katsumi, Sachiyo; Han, Dongjun; Bizaki-Vallaskangas, Argyro J; Vasilijic, Sasa; Landegger, Lukas D; Kristiansen, Arthur G; McKenna, Michael J; Stankovic, Konstantina M",Bone,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bone.2020.115837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33385614/,8
143438,Antibody targeting of cell-bound MUC1 SEA domain kills tumor cells.,2012,"BACKGROUND Several studies have shown that laparoscopic hernia repair for large paraesophageal hiatal hernia is associated with a high recurrence rate. Therefore, some authors recommend the use of prosthetic meshes. Considering the dynamic area between the esophagus and the diaphragmatic crura with its constant motion, it is astonishing that only a minor number of surgeons describe mesh-associated complications. METHODS Between January 2000 and August 2008, 26 patients of the Centre Hospitalier Emile Mayrisch (CHEM, Luxembourg) underwent laparoscopic repair for large paraesophageal hiatal hernia (median age, 70 (range, 39-90) years). In nine patients, prosthetic mesh reinforcement was performed (7 composite/2 mono-phase mesh). Crural repair without tension was performed only with sutures. There were no conversions. Follow-up assessment was prospective with the GIQL (Gastro-Intestinal Quality of Life) Index. RESULTS Responses to the GIQLI questionnaires were obtained from 20 patients (6 died of unrelated causes). Nineteen patients were satisfied with their symptom control 1 year after the operation (GIQLI 127). Sixteen patients had radiological follow-up (median, 24 months). Three patients treated without mesh (3/10) showed a radiological recurrence. All of them (3/10) had symptoms. None of the controlled patients with mesh (0/6) showed a recurrence. One patient developed a severe aortal bleeding 1, 2, and 3 weeks after the laparoscopic mono-phase mesh repair. During conventional operation, the bleeding stopped. Three years later, the follow-up showed a satisfied patient (GIQLI 127). CONCLUSIONS In view of the described complication, there is still considerable controversy regarding the routine use of mesh. To increase safety, a composite mesh should be preferred.","Zügel, Nico; Lang, Reinhold A; Kox, Martin; Hüttl, Thomas P",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-009-0456-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19440795/,8
143462,Foreword.,2021,"OBJECTIVE To evaluate the accuracy of primary health care audiograms conducted by non-qualified examiners in a non-standard acoustic environment. STUDY DESIGN Retrospective chart review. SETTING Referring primary health care institutions and hospital hearing center. PATIENTS One thousand two hundred twenty four adult patients evaluated for hearing aid fitting at North Karelia Central hospital in years 2017 and 2018. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), mean threshold differences, and mean absolute errors were used to assess agreement between primary health care and hospital audiograms. Primary health care audiometry sensitivity, specificity and positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values were calculated for hearing aid candidacy in general and open ear mold candidacy in particular. RESULTS ICC for both better ear hearing level (BEHL0.5,1,2,4 kHz) and pure-tone average (PTA0.5,1,2,4 kHz) in frequencies 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz was 0.82, and in individual full octave frequencies from 0.125 to 8 kHz ranged from 0.70 to 0.83. Mean threshold differences in BEHL0.5,1,2,4 kHz and PTA0.5,1,2,4 kHz were 1.8 and 1.6 dB and mean absolute errors 4.9 and 5.3 dB, respectively. Sensitivity for hearing aid candidacy was 0.97, specificity 0.58, PPV 0.92, and NPV 0.79. CONCLUSIONS Primary health care audiometry is reasonably accurate, allowing preselection of patients to adequate hearing care pathways.","Kokkonen, Jukka; Varonen, Sini","Otology & neurotology : official publication of the American Otological Society, American Neurotology Society [and] European Academy of Otology and Neurotology",https://doi.org/10.1097/mao.0000000000002982; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33351556/,8

There is often uncertainty in clinical judgment about fetal monitoring, timing of delivery, and mode of delivery because of the challenge in balancing maternal and fetal interests in reducing morbidity and mortality. The obstetrician and critical care team should empower pregnant patients or their surrogate decision maker to make informed decisions in response to the team's clinical evaluation.

Laparoscopic greater curvature plication is an operation that is gaining ground in the treatment of morbid obesity, as it appears to replicate the results of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with fewer complications. Aim. Review of current literature, especially results on weight loss and complications. Method. 11 (eleven) published articles on laparoscopic gastric plication, of which 1 preclinical study, 8 prospective studies for a total of 521 patients and 2 case reports of unusual complications. Results. Reported Paracentage of EWL in all studies is comparable to Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (around 50% in 6 months, 60-65% in 12 months, 60-65% in 24 months) and total complication rate is at 15,1% with minor complications in 10,7%, major complications in 4,4%. Reoperation rate was 3%, conversion rate was 0,2%, and mortality was zero. Conclusion. Current literature on gastric plication and its modifications is limited and sketchy at times. Low cost, short hospital stay, absence of prosthetic material, and reversibility make it an attractive option. Initial data show that LGCP is effective for short- and medium-term weight loss, complication and reoperation rates are low, and GERD symptoms are unaffected. More data is required, and randomized control trials must be completed in order to reach safe conclusions.","Kourkoulos, Michael; Giorgakis, Emmanouil; Kokkinos, Charalampos; Mavromatis, Theodoros; Griniatsos, John; Nikiteas, Nikolaos; Tsigris, Christos",Minimally invasive surgery,https://doi.org/10.1155/2012/696348; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22811900/,8
144293,Incidence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis after adoption of restrictive gadolinium-based contrast agent guidelines.,2011,"BACKGROUND The vertical banded gastroplasty (VBG) used to be a common restrictive bariatric procedure but has been abandoned by many due to a high failure rate, a high incidence of long-term complications, and the newer adjustable gastric band (AGB) and sleeve. However, potential favorable long-term results and the upcoming banded gastric bypass, with a similar mechanical outlet restriction and control of the pouch size, renewed our interest in the VBG. Therefore, we investigated the long-term outcome of primary VBG at the Catharina Hospital in the Netherlands. METHODS Patients that underwent a primary VBG between 1998 and 2008 were included. Patients' characteristics, operative details, evolution on weight and comorbidities, complications, and outcome of revisions were reviewed. RESULTS A total of 392 patients (80 % female) were reviewed with a mean age of 40 ± 9 years and body mass index of 44 ± 5 kg/m(2). Mean follow-up after VBG was 66 ± 50 months and showed a mean excess weight loss (EWL) of 53 ± 27 % and comorbidity reduction of 54 %. One hundred fifty-two patients (39 %) out of 227 patients (58 %) with long-term complaints underwent revisional surgery. Main reasons for revision were weight regain and vomiting/food intolerance. Analysis before revision showed an outlet dilatation (17 %), pouch dilatation (16 %), and outlet stenosis (10 %). After revision, an additional EWL of 23 % and 33 % further reduction in comorbidities was seen. CONCLUSIONS Primary VBG has an acceptable EWL of 53 % and 55 % of comorbidities were improved. However, the high complication rate, often necessitating revision, underlines the limits of this procedure.","van Wezenbeek, M R; Smulders, J F; de Zoete, J P J G M; Luyer, M D; van Montfort, G; Nienhuijs, S W",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-014-1543-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25519773/,8

Currently, there is a lack of knowledge about the burden and etiology of LRTI in children under five years of age in Indonesia. METHODOLOGY We have systematically searched the available English and Indonesian scientific literature to review and summarize data on LRTI and LRTI-associated invasive disease, and bacterial carriage in the upper respiratory tract in children under five years of age in Indonesia. RESULTS Overall, data on the burden and etiology of LRTI in children under five years of age in Indonesia is very limited. The data are primarily collected in Java. Data from other parts of Indonesia, including Sumatra, Kalimantan, and Sulawesi, are scarce. The case fatality rate (CFR) of LRTI in children under five years of age in Indonesia was 0.11%. Influenza was the most commonly reported viral etiological agent of LRTI in children under five years of age in Indonesia. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most frequently reported bacterial agent of LRTI. Streptococcus pneumoniae showed the highest carriage rates. CONCLUSIONS Surveillance and diagnostic studies are urgently needed and should be conducted in different parts of Indonesia to improve insight in the burden and etiology of LRTI in Indonesia.

Studies conducted in China recommended the use of liquorice (Glycyrrhiza species), an integral medicinal herb of traditional Chinese medicine in the deactivation of COVID-19. Therefore, the present investigation was undertaken to identify the leads from the liquorice plant against COVID-19 using molecular docking simulation studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS A set of reported bioactive compounds of liquorice were investigated for COVID-19 main protease (Mpro) inhibitory potential. The study was conducted on Autodock vina software using COVID-19 Mpro as a target protein having PDB ID: 6LU7. RESULTS Out of the total 20 docked compounds, only six compounds showed the best affinity towards the protein target, which included glycyrrhizic acid, isoliquiritin apioside, glyasperin A, liquiritin, 1-methoxyphaseollidin and hedysarimcoumestan B. From the overall observation, glycyrrhizic acid followed by isoliquiritin apioside demonstrated the best affinity towards Mpro representing the binding energy of -8.6 and -7.9 Kcal/mol respectively. Nevertheless, the other four compounds were also quite comparable with the later one. CONCLUSION From the present investigation, we conclude that the compounds having oxane ring and chromenone ring substituted with hydroxyl 3-methylbut-2-enyl group could be the best alternative for the development of new leads from liquorice plant against COVID-19.","Sinha, Saurabh K; Prasad, Satyendra K; Islam, Md Ataul; Chaudhary, Sushil K; Singh, Shashikant; Shakya, Anshul",Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening,https://doi.org/10.2174/1386207323999200817103148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32807047/,8

We report the prevalence of early recanalization in patients with stroke because of large vessel occlusion treated with and without intravenous alteplase and endovascular thrombectomy, and its association with clinical outcome. METHODS Patients with acute ischemic stroke with large vessel occlusion from the ESCAPE trial (Endovascular Treatment for Small Core and Anterior Circulation Proximal Occlusion With Emphasis on Minimizing CT to Recanalization Times Trial) were included in this post hoc analysis. Outcomes of interest were the prevalence of early recanalization (1) and good outcome (2), defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0 to 2 at 90 days. RESULTS Among 147 patients who did not receive endovascular thrombectomy, early recanalization occurred in 4/30 (13.3%) patients without and 48/117 (41.0%) patients with intravenous alteplase (adjusted risk ratios, 3.2 [95% CI, 1.2-8.1]). Good outcome was achieved by 34/116 (29.3%) of patients who received intravenous alteplase versus 10/29 (34.5%) who did not receive alteplase (adjusted risk ratios, 1.0 [95% CI, 0.6-1.5) and by 20/52 (38.5%) patients with versus 24/93 (25.8%) without early recanalization (adjusted risk ratios, 1.9 [95% CI, 1.2-2.9]).

BACKGROUND Exercise intensity is the primary stimulus for physical and mental adaptation. METHODS We conducted a MEDLINE search (1985 to February 2016) for exercise-based rehabilitation trials in heart failure using the search terms 'exercise training', 'left ventricular dysfunction', 'peak VO2', 'cardiomyopathy', and 'systolic heart dysfunction'. RESULTS Twenty-five studies were included; 4 (16%) comprised high-, 10 (40%) vigorous-, 9 (36%) moderate- and 0 (0%) low-intensity groups; two studies were unclassified. The 25 studies provided a total of 2,385 participants, 1,223 exercising and 1,162 controls (36,056 patient-hours of training). Analyses reported significant improvement in total Minnesota living with heart failure (MLWHF) total score [mean difference (MD) -8.24, 95% CI -11.55 to -4.92, p < 0.00001]. Physical MLWHF scorewas significantly improved in all studies (MD -2.89, 95% CI -4.27 to -1.50, p < 0.00001). MLWHF total score was significantly reduced after high- (MD -13.74, 95% CI -21.34 to -6.14, p = 0.0004) and vigorous-intensity training (MD -8.56, 95% CI -12.77 to -4.35, p < 0.0001) but not moderate-intensity training. A significant improvement in the total MLWHF score was seen after aerobic training (MD -3.87, 95% CI -6.97 to -0.78, p = 0.01), and combined aerobic and resistance training (MD -9.82, 95% CI -15.71 to -3.92, p = 0.001), but not resistance training.

However, treatment of aneurysms at and beyond the circle of Willis is not well-established. We assessed the clinical safety and efficacy of the Flow Re-Direction Endoluminal Device Jr (FRED Jr) dedicated to small-vessel diameters between 2.0 and 3.0 mm. MATERIALS AND METHODS This was a multicenter observational clinical study of 42 patients with 47 aneurysms treated by a flow-direction technique with the FRED Jr. The primary end point for clinical safety was the absence of death, major or minor stroke, and TIA. The primary end point for treatment efficacy was complete and near-complete occlusion according to the O'Kelly-Marotta grading scale at follow-up after 1, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS The FRED Jr deployment was technically successful in all cases. In 39/42 (93%) patients, the primary safety end point was reached; in the 3 remaining patients, 1 disabling ischemic stroke, 1 minor stroke with complete recovery at discharge, and 1 TIA were observed. Two asymptomatic, completely reversible side-branch occlusions occurred. Angiographic (DSA or flat panel CT) and clinical follow-up were available after 1 month in 41/47 (87%), 6 months in 27/47 (57%), and 12 months in 11/47 (23%) aneurysms.

To define the vulnerabilities of mTORC1-addicted cancer cells and to find previously unknown therapeutic targets, we investigated the mechanism of piperlongumine, a small molecule identified in a chemical library screen to specifically target cancer cells with a hyperactive mTORC1 phenotype. Sensitivity to piperlongumine was dependent on its ability to suppress RUVBL1/2-TTT, a complex involved in chromatin remodeling and DNA repair. Cancer cells with high mTORC1 activity are subjected to higher levels of DNA damage stress via c-Myc and displayed an increased dependency on RUVBL1/2 for survival and counteracting genotoxic stress. Examination of clinical cancer tissues also demonstrated that high mTORC1 activity was accompanied by high RUVBL2 expression. Our findings reveal a previously unknown role for RUVBL1/2 in cell survival, where it acts as a functional chaperone to mitigate stress levels induced in the mTORC1-Myc-DNA damage axis.","Shin, Seung Ho; Lee, Ji Su; Zhang, Jia-Min; Choi, Sungbin; Boskovic, Zarko V; Zhao, Ran; Song, Mengqiu; Wang, Rui; Tian, Jie; Lee, Mee-Hyun; Kim, Jae Hwan; Jeong, Minju; Lee, Jung Hyun; Petukhov, Michael; Lee, Sam W; Kim, Sang Gyun; Zou, Lee; Byun, Sanguine",Science advances,https://doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.aay9131; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32789167/,8

The SWR amplitude in a NiFe film shows a higher-order frequency variation than in a magnetoelastic Ni film. This frequency dependence is well understood in terms of the presence of a gyromagnetic field attributable to the local lattice rotation in the R-SAW. From the frequency dependence of the SWR amplitude, the gyromagnetic SWR could be separated from another SWR caused by a magnetoelastic effect of the ferromagnet.","Kurimune, Yuki; Matsuo, Mamoru; Nozaki, Yukio",Physical review letters,https://doi.org/10.1103/physrevlett.124.217205; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32530648/,8

METHODS Two hundred eighty-eight consecutive patients underwent CTPA scans for suspected pulmonary embolism between September 1, 2013 and January 31, 2014. One hundred ninety-four at DSHP scans, 57 SS scans, and 37 DE scans were analyzed. Coronary arteries were separated into nine segments, and coronary artery motion was qualitatively scored using a scale from 1 to 4 (non-interpretable to diagnostic with no motion artifacts). Signal intensity, noise, and signal to noise ratio (SNR) of the aorta, main pulmonary artery, and paraspinal muscles were also assessed. RESULTS DSHP CTPA images had significantly less coronary artery motion, with 30.1% of coronary segments being fully evaluable compared to 4.2% of SS segments and 7.9% of DE segments (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). When imaging with DSHP, the proximal coronary arteries were more frequently evaluable than distal coronary arteries (51% versus 11.3%, p < 0.001). Without ECG synchronization and heart rate control, the distal left anterior descending coronary artery and mid right coronary artery remain infrequently interpretable (7% and 9%, respectively) on DSHP images. CONCLUSIONS DSHP CTPA decreases coronary artery motion artifacts and allows for full evaluation of the proximal coronary arteries in 51% of cases. The study highlights the increasing importance of proximal coronary artery review when interpreting CTPA for acute chest pain.","Thomas, David M; McLaughlin, Patrick D; Nugent, James P; Barrett, Sarah A; Mayo, John R; Bilawich, Ana-Maria; Wong, Graham C; Nicolaou, Savvas",Emergency radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10140-018-01661-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30539378/,8

They have suffered a disproportionate number of deaths; Covid patients eighty years or older on ventilators had fatality rates higher than 90 percent. How could we have better protected older adults? Both the popular press and government entities blamed nursing homes, labeling them ""snake pits"" and imposing harsh fines and arduous new regulations. We argue that this approach is unlikely to improve protections for older adults. Rather than focusing exclusively on acute and critical resources, including ventilators, a plan that respected the best interests of older adults would have also supported nursing homes, a critical part of the health care system. Better access to protective equipment for staff members, early testing of staff members and patients, and enhanced means of communication with families were what was needed. These preventive measures would have offered greater benefit to the oldest members of our population than the exclusive focus on acute care.","Powell, Tia; Bellin, Eran; Ehrlich, Amy R",The Hastings Center report,https://doi.org/10.1002/hast.1136; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32596888/,8

This dread of termination may interfere with both the patient's capacity to terminate and the analyst's capacity to let patients go. Certain patients have an intense wish to maintain a permanent connection with the analyst. Analysing that wish does not necessarily change the patient's conviction that they are not ready to fully terminate. The love experienced in the transference may be the best love relationship that the patient has ever had. The intensity and pervasiveness of the infantile in our work may best be glimpsed by studying the defences against the infantile. Ultimately, we must respect the patient's limits in some cases, rather than pick them apart and cajole the patient into another view that we prefer.

Schools often function as ""de facto"" service systems for most children with disabilities, particularly those from racially and ethnically minoritized, economically vulnerable, and bilingual populations. The impact of school closures on children with disabilities poses significant ramifications for the medical, behavioral health, and educational systems in which they are served, necessitating the need for pediatric clinicians to collaborate with schools in purposeful ways. This commentary (1) presents an overview of the current guidance for providing school-based services to children with disabilities during the COVID context with many schools operating in virtual or hybrid formats, (2) reviews potential service inequities exacerbated by school closures and lack of on-site services, and (3) offers recommendations for collaborating with school staff and community agencies in support of children and families with disabilities.","Harris, Bryn; McClain, Maryellen Brunson; O'Leary, Sonja; Shahidullah, Jeffrey D",Journal of developmental and behavioral pediatrics : JDBP,https://doi.org/10.1097/dbp.0000000000000921; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33596007/,8

148418,Interactions of antiepileptic drugs with drugs approved for the treatment of indications other than epilepsy.,2020-12-11,"The implementation of biosecurity measures in the animal health and production context is quite broad and aims at limiting the risk of introduction and spread of diseases. Veterinarians play a major role in biosecurity as key informants on the subject for cattle holders, key players in terms of disease prevention/control and eradication programs, as well as key risk factor in terms of disease dissemination. Many biosecurity studies have highlighted professional visitors such as veterinary practitioners as representing a high-risk factor in terms of disease introduction in animal facilities but, to date, very few studies have focused on the implementation level of biosecurity measures by veterinarians. An online survey was implemented in three European countries (Belgium, France and Spain) to assess the behaviour of rural veterinarians towards biosecurity, as well as their implementation level of the biosecurity measures. A descriptive analysis of data and a scoring system were applied to assess the implementation level of measures. The influence of different factors on the implementation level of biosecurity measures was investigated through a negative binomial regression model. The study identified different strengths, weaknesses, possible constraints and solutions in terms of veterinary perspectives. Veterinarians are considered as key informants by the farmers and could therefore play a more active role in terms of guidance and improvement of biosecurity at farm level. Based on the survey outcomes, two factors seemed to influence significantly the implementation level of measures: the country where he/she practices and the veterinarian's perception level of biosecurity. The biosecurity stages with the lowest application level, therefore representing the biggest threats, were bio-exclusion (increasing the risk of disease introduction) and biocontainment (increasing the risk of inter-herd transmission).","Renault, V; Humblet, M F; Moons, V; Bosquet, G; Gauthier, B; Cebrián, L M; Casal, J; Saegerman, C",Transboundary and emerging diseases,https://doi.org/10.1111/tbed.12719; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28940807/,8

Data collected within the Mediterranean Islands (MEDIS) Study, a health and nutrition survey of elderly people living on Mediterranean islands was used. A total of 851 postmenopausal women living in various Greek islands, Cyprus, and Malta participated in the study. Depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). Age-adjusted logistic regression analysis showed that a year's increase in the time since menopause increased the likelihood of postmenopausal women having severe depressive symptoms by 3% (odds ratio [OR] per 1 year = 1.03, 95% CI 1.001-1.05). This positive association was also evident when other potential confounding factors (i.e, living conditions, financial status, physical activity, adherence to the Mediterranean diet, smoking habits, and several clinical conditions) were also taken into account in multivariable analyses.

The advent of increasingly sophisticated diagnostics tools has revolutionized our capacity to detect and respond to these health threats more rapidly than ever before. Yet, no matter how sophisticated these tools become, the initial identification of emerging infectious diseases begins at the local community level. It is here that the initial human or animal case resides, and it is here that early pathogen detection would have maximum benefit. Unfortunately, many areas at highest risk of zoonotic disease emergence lack sufficient infrastructure capacity to support robust laboratory diagnostic systems. Multiple factors are essential for pathogen detection networks, including an understanding of the complex sociological and ecological factors influencing disease transmission risk, community engagement, surveillance along high-risk human-animal interfaces, and a skilled laboratory workforce.

METHODS Retrospective, observational, cohort study of pediatric patients with IBD, receiving infliximab, adalimumab, vedolizumab, or ustekinumab for at least 2 months. Data related to the immediate and delayed adverse events (AEs) were collected, focusing on the reaction type and severity, the time of onset, the outcome and the temporary or definitive therapy discontinuation secondary to the AE. Number of suspected and confirmed coronavirus disease-209 (COVID-19) cases and their outcomes, as well as flu vaccination coverage were collected. RESULTS One hundred eighty-five children were included (101 [55%] CD, 82 [44%] UC, and 2 [1%] IBDU): 149 received infliximab (IFX) (81%), 88 (48%) adalimumab (ADA), 18 (21%) vedolizumab, and 4 (2%) ustekinumab. The overall AE rates were 49%, 67% of whom likely medication-related. Eleven (6%) patients experienced more than 1 AE, 18 patients (10%) presented an immediate reaction, and 82 (45%) a delayed AE. Among the 90 patients experiencing at least 1 AE, 97% had mild-to-moderate AEs. Only 4 SAEs were reported (4%). Treatment discontinuation because of AE occurred in 25 patients (14%). Four COVID-19 cases were reported, all with a mild course. CONCLUSIONS Our findings confirm a good safety profile of biologics.

150656,Overview on the Amendments of Provisions for Drug Registration in China.,2020-07-12,"AIM Though caffeine is a consolidated treatment in preterm infants, the efficacy and safety of a higher dose have not been systematically appraised. METHODS A systematic review was conducted to compare high (loading dose >20 mg/kg and maintenance >10 mg/kg/day) versus low dose of caffeine. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Central and conference proceedings for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs were searched. Two authors independently screened the records, extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias. RESULTS As only six RCTs enrolling a total of 816 preterm infants were included, the required information size was not reached. The loading and maintenance doses varied between 20 and 80 mg/kg/day and 3 and 20 mg/kg/day, respectively. The use of high dose had no impact on mortality (RR: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.53-1.38; RCTs = 4). However, it resulted in fewer cases of extubation failure, apnoeas and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (RR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.60-0.96; studies = 4) and shorter duration of mechanical ventilation. The quality of the evidence was low due to imprecision of the estimates. CONCLUSION Due to imprecision, it is not possible to determine whether high-dose caffeine is more effective and safe than a low dose.

METHODS In this retrospective study, Parent Stress Scale (PSS, parent-report) and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ, parent-proxy; SDQ-S, self-report for 11 years and older) were used to evaluate parental stress levels and behavioral functioning, respectively. Descriptive and comparative statistical approaches were applied to summarize the data and to determine differences in scores between diagnoses, gender, and developmental functioning. RESULTS Two hundred patients and caregivers participated in BMP during the study period. PSS scores were significantly higher for caregivers of patients with IC than ARM. Statistical differences in SDQ were found for patients with IC versus those with ARM, male versus female patients, and patients with developmental delays versus those without delays. No significant differences were found in SDQ-S scores between these groups. CONCLUSION Key findings suggest that level of parental stress and behavioral concerns were significantly influenced by diagnoses, and partly by gender and presence of developmental delay. Thus, psychosocial support may need to be tailored based on these findings to provide optimum quality of care for patients and families.","Judd-Glossy, Laura; Ariefdjohan, Merlin; Ketzer, Jill; Curry, Stefanie; Schletker, Julie; Edmonds, Tiffany; Krause, Amy; Simmons, Hope; Pena, Alberto; De La Torre, Luis; Bischoff, Andrea",Pediatric surgery international,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00383-020-04836-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423102/,8

It further investigates if reframing and altering the meaning of one's work (i.e., cognitive job crafting) buffers the relationships between turnover intentions, negative affect, and task mastery.Design and methods: We conducted a three-wave longitudinal study among caregivers. Our final sample consisted of 241 caregivers from 53 different care homes. We tested our hypotheses via path analysis while estimating standard errors that are robust to non-independence of observations.Results: Analyses showed that cognitive crafting moderated the relationship between turnover intentions and negative affect: When caregivers cognitively crafted their job, turnover intentions were negatively related to negative affect.Conclusions: This study indicates that cognitive crafting can be considered a coping strategy during difficult times at work. If employees do not devalue but revalue their job despite having turnover intentions, they can keep negative affect at bay. Still, this study also illustrates the limits of cognitive crafting by showing that the relationship between turnover intentions and task mastery is not affected by reframing one's work.","Hommelhoff, Sabine; Weseler, Daniela; Niessen, Cornelia","Anxiety, stress, and coping",https://doi.org/10.1080/10615806.2021.1892653; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33650439/,8

151810,Cerebral venous thrombosis: a practical guide.,2020-08-29,"Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)-related anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are likely to be a significant long-term issue emerging from the current pandemic. We hypothesize that cannabidiol (CBD), a chemical isolated from Cannabis sativa with reported anxiolytic properties, could be a therapeutic option for the treatment of COVID-19-related anxiety disorders. In the global over-the-counter CBD market, anxiety, stress, depression, and sleep disorders are consistently the top reasons people use CBD. In small randomized controlled clinical trials, CBD (300-800 mg) reduces anxiety in healthy volunteers, patients with social anxiety disorder, those at clinical high risk of psychosis, in patients with Parkinson's disease, and in individuals with heroin use disorder. Observational studies and case reports support these findings, extending to patients with anxiety and sleep disorders, Crohn's disease, depression, and in PTSD. Larger ongoing trials in this area continue to add to this evidence base with relevant patient cohorts, sample sizes, and clinical end-points. Pre-clinical studies reveal the molecular targets of CBD in these indications as the cannabinoid receptor type 1 and cannabinoid receptor type 2 (mainly in fear memory processing), serotonin 1A receptor (mainly in anxiolysis) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (mainly in the underpinning anti-inflammatory/antioxidant effects). Observational and pre-clinical data also support CBD's therapeutic value in improving sleep (increased sleep duration/quality and reduction in nightmares) and depression, which are often comorbid with anxiety. Together these features of CBD make it an attractive novel therapeutic option in COVID-related PTSS that merits investigation and testing through appropriately designed randomized controlled trials.","O'Sullivan, Saoirse E; Stevenson, Carl W; Laviolette, Steven R",Cannabis and cannabinoid research,https://doi.org/10.1089/can.2020.0102; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33614948/,8

Behaviorally, this is proposed to manifest in reduced social orienting (individuals with ASD direct less attention towards social stimuli) and reduced social seeking (individuals with ASD invest less effort to receive social stimuli). In two meta-analyses, involving data from over 6000 participants, we review the available behavioral studies that assess social orienting and social seeking behaviors in ASD. We found robust evidence for reduced social orienting in ASD, across a range of paradigms, demographic variables and stimulus contexts. The most robust predictor of this effect was interactive content - effects were larger when the stimulus involved an interaction between people. By contrast, the evidence for reduced social seeking indicated weaker evidence for group differences, observed only under specific experimental conditions. The insights gained from this meta-analysis can inform design of relevant task measures for social reward responsivity and promote directions for further study on the ASD phenotype.","Hedger, Nicholas; Dubey, Indu; Chakrabarti, Bhismadev",Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2020.10.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33069686/,8

We report the diagnostic performance of chest CT using structured reporting in a routine clinical setting during the early phase of the epidemic in Germany. METHODS Patients with clinical suspicion of COVID-19 and moderate-to-severe symptoms were included in this retrospective study. CTs were performed and reported before RT-PCR results (reference standard) became available. A structured reporting system was used that concluded in a recently described five-grade score (""CO-RADS""), indicating the level of suspicion for pulmonary involvement of COVID-19 from 1 = very low to 5 = very high. Structured reporting was performed by three Radiologists in consensus. RESULTS In 96 consecutive patients (50 male, mean age 64), RT-PCR was positive in 20 (21%) cases. CT features significantly more common in RT-PCR-positive patients were ground-glass opacities as dominant feature, crazy paving, hazy margins of opacities, and multifocal bilateral distribution (p < 0.05). Using a cut-off point between CO-RADS 3 and 4, sensitivity was 90%, specificity 91%, positive predictive value 72%, negative predictive value 97%, and accuracy 91%. ROC analysis showed an AUC of 0.938. CONCLUSIONS Structured reporting of chest CT with a five-grade scale provided accurate diagnosis of COVID-19. Its use was feasible and helpful in clinical routine. ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE Chest CT with structured reporting may be a provisional diagnostic alternative to RT-PCR testing for early diagnosis of COVID-19, especially when RT-PCR results are delayed or test capacities are limited.","Gross, Alexander; Heine, Georg; Schwarz, Martin; Thiemig, Dorina; Gläser, Sven; Albrecht, Thomas",The British journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.1259/bjr.20200574; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33245241/,8

We recruited community pharmacists and pharmacy interns from a statewide pharmacy conference to complete a 40-item cross-sectional survey. Informed by the Theory of Planned Behavior, the survey assessed pharmacists' HPV vaccine-related behaviors, intentions, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control to vaccinate against HPV. We analyzed all data using descriptive statistics and correlations. Overall, most pharmacists held positive attitudes about the HPV vaccine. However, the majority rarely administered the HPV vaccine. Intentions to vaccinate and subjective norms positively correlated with vaccine administration behavior. Pharmacists' positive attitudes about the vaccine, subjective norm to vaccinate, and behavioral control or self-efficacy to recommend the vaccine impacted their intentions to vaccinate against HPV. Most surveyed pharmacists believed that the most substantial HPV vaccine administration barriers include parental consent and parental stigma against the vaccine. The most common pharmacy-related barrier was the lack of a tracking and reminder system to encourage patients to return for additional HPV vaccine doses. This work highlights the need to increase public awareness that pharmacists can administer vaccines to adolescents. Study authors recommend offering communication training to increase pharmacists' perceived behavioral control to recommend the HPV vaccine.","Koskan, Alexis; Vizcaino, Maricarmen; Brennhofer, Stephanie A; Lee, Chong D; Roberto, Anthony J",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1080/21645515.2021.1905469; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33886423/,8

However, COVID-19 patients lead to pulmonary fibrosis, such a serious threat to the prognosis of complications were also worthy of our attention. First of all, we proposed the possible mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis caused by SARS-CoV-2, based on the published data of COVID-19 (①Direct evidence: pulmonary fibrosis was found in autopsy and pulmonary puncture pathology.②Indirect evidence: increased levels of fibrosis-related cytokines[TGF- β, TNF- α, IL-6, etc.] in peripheral blood of severe patients.). What's more, we summarized the role of three fibrosis-related signaling pathways (TGF- β signal pathway, WNT signal pathway and YAP/TAZ signal pathway) in pulmonary fibrosis. Finally, we suggested the therapeutic value of two drugs (Pirfenidone and Nintedanib) for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis in COVID-19-induced pulmonary fibrosis. This article is protected by copyright.

In a multicenter, international study, we investigated if overweight, obesity, and diabetes were independently associated with COVID-19 severity and whether the BMI-associated risk was increased among those with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS We retrospectively extracted data from health care records and regional databases of hospitalized adult patients with COVID-19 from 18 sites in 11 countries. We used standardized definitions and analyses to generate site-specific estimates, modeling the odds of each outcome (supplemental oxygen/noninvasive ventilatory support, invasive mechanical ventilatory support, and in-hospital mortality) by BMI category (reference, overweight, obese), adjusting for age, sex, and prespecified comorbidities. Subgroup analysis was performed on patients with preexisting diabetes. Site-specific estimates were combined in a meta-analysis. RESULTS Among 7,244 patients (65.6% overweight/obese), those with overweight were more likely to require oxygen/noninvasive ventilatory support (random effects adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.44; 95% CI 1.15-1.80) and invasive mechanical ventilatory support (aOR, 1.22; 95% CI 1.03-1.46). There was no association between overweight and in-hospital mortality (aOR, 0.88; 95% CI 0.74-1.04). Similar effects were observed in patients with obesity or diabetes. In the subgroup analysis, the aOR for any outcome was not additionally increased in those with diabetes and overweight or obesity. CONCLUSIONS In adults hospitalized with COVID-19, overweight, obesity, and diabetes were associated with increased odds of requiring respiratory support but were not associated with death. In patients with diabetes, the odds of severe COVID-19 were not increased above the BMI-associated risk.","Longmore, Danielle K; Miller, Jessica E; Bekkering, Siroon; Saner, Christoph; Mifsud, Edin; Zhu, Yanshan; Saffery, Richard; Nichol, Alistair; Colditz, Graham; Short, Kirsty R; Burgner, David P",Diabetes care,https://doi.org/10.2337/dc20-2676; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33858854/,8

In this prospective study, we assessed risk factors for recurrent wheezing during a 12-month follow-up in 313 infants aged <12 months hospitalised for their first episode of bronchiolitis. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were obtained with a questionnaire and from medical files. A total of 14 respiratory viruses were concurrently assayed in nasal washings. Parents were interviewed 12 months after hospitalisation to check whether their infants experienced recurrent wheezing. The rate of recurrent wheezing was higher in infants with bronchiolitis than in controls (52.7 versus 10.3%; p<0.001). Multivariate analysis identified rhinovirus (RV) infection (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.0-11.1) followed by a positive family history for asthma (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.2-4.9) as major independent risk factors for recurrent wheezing. In conclusion, the virus most likely to be associated with recurrent wheezing at 12 months after initial bronchiolitis is RV, a viral agent that could predict infants prone to the development of recurrent wheezing.","Midulla, F; Pierangeli, A; Cangiano, G; Bonci, E; Salvadei, S; Scagnolari, C; Moretti, C; Antonelli, G; Ferro, V; Papoff, P",The European respiratory journal,https://doi.org/10.1183/09031936.00188210; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21852336/,8

For many people, this occurred in the context of working from makeshift home offices with novel distractions. We describe the results of an online survey of mental health clinicians and staff regarding their experiences in rapidly converting to full-time TMH and work from home (WFH) during COVID-19. Methods: Fourteen clinicians and 11 administrative staff from two outpatient mental health clinics in a large academic medical center completed the survey in May 2020. Results: More than 85% of participants rated the experience of providing or supporting full-time TMH care as ""somewhat better"" or ""much better than expected."" Clinicians and administrative staff reported perceptions that most clients were satisfied with TMH services. Identified TMH challenges included difficulty providing clinical forms and difficulties with technology. Identified benefits of WFH included lack of commute, time with loved ones, opportunities for self-care, and increased flexibility. Maintaining team cohesion and communication while working remotely, and setting boundaries between work and nonwork hours were identified as challenges. Nearly all respondents indicated a preference to continue some TMH from home in the future. Conclusions: Findings suggest that rapidly adopting TMH and WFH during a pandemic were well accepted. Should the progression of the pandemic require agile movement in and out of TMH and WFH, overcommunication and extra attention to supporting employee connection and morale are especially important.","Steidtmann, Dana; McBride, Samantha; Mishkind, Matthew C",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,https://doi.org/10.1089/tmj.2020.0305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33301354/,8

In this study, we predict changes in haemodynamic parameters(as apart of patient outcome) after valve replacement treatment in aortic stenosis patients. A framework to incorporate uncertainty in patient-specific model predictions for decision support is presented. A0Dlumped parameter mode lincluding the left ventricle, astenotic valve and systemic circulatory system has been developed, based on models published earlier. The Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)isused to optimize model input parameters to fit measured data pre-intervention. After optimization, the valve treatment is simulated by significantly reducing valve resistance. Uncertain model parameters are then propagated using a polynomial chaos expansion approach. To test the proposed framework, three in silico test cases are developed with clinically feasible measurements. Quality and availability of simulated measured patient data are decreased in each case. The UKF approach is compared to a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) approach, a well-known approach in modelling predictions with uncertainty. Both methods show increased confidence intervals as measurement quality decreases. By considering three in silico test-cases we incorporate optimization uncertainty in model predictions and is faster and the MCMC approach, although it is more sensitive to noise in flow measurements.

METHODS We examined a subsample (n=144) from one site of a two-site study of adults with diagnosed Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), recruited from 4/13/05 to 12/22/09, who consented to the additional blood draw for serum histamine and carnitine levels. After washout, eligible subjects were randomized to SAMe (1600-3200mg/daily), escitalopram (10-20mg/daily), or matching placebo for 12 weeks of double-blind treatment (titration at week 6 in non-response). RESULTS On the primary outcome of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), a significant difference in improvement was observed between groups from baseline to week 12 (p=0.039). The effect size from baseline to endpoint was moderate to large for SAMe versus placebo (d=0.74). SAMe was superior to placebo from week 1, and to escitalopram during weeks 2, 4, and 6. No significant effect was found between escitalopram and placebo or SAMe. Response rates (HAMD-17≥50% reduction) at endpoint were 45%, 31%, and 26% for SAMe, escitalopram, and placebo, respectively; while remission rates (HAM-D≤7) were 34% for SAMe (p=0.003), 23% for escitalopram (p=0.023), and 6% for placebo. No correlation between baseline histamine level and reduction of HAMD-17 score was found for either the SAMe or escitalopram groups. Baseline carnitine levels were also not found to moderate response to either treatment.

CONCLUSIONS These preliminary results provide encouraging evidence for the use of SAMe in the treatment of MDD.

155776,ASO Visual Abstract: The Prognostic Value of Lymph Node Ratio in Locally Advanced Esophageal Cancer Patients Who Received Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy.,2021-07-12,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an emerging porcine coronavirus that causes a tremendous economic burden on the swine industry. The assessment of PEDV-neutralizing antibody levels provides a valuable tool to assess and predict herd immunity. We evaluated the performance of a PEDV imaging cytometry-based high-throughput neutralization test (HTNT) and compared the HTNT to a fluorescent focus neutralization (FFN) assay using serum samples from pigs of known PEDV infection status (n = 159). Estimates of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity for HTNT and FFN assays derived from receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses showed that both PEDV FFN and HTNT provided excellent diagnostic performance. However, in the laboratory, imaging cytometry provided an objective and semi-automated approach that removed human subjectivity from the testing process and reduced the read-time of a 96-well plate to < 4 min. In addition, imaging cytometry facilitated the rapid collection and long-term storage of test images and data for further evaluation or client consultation. For PEDV and other pathogens, imaging cytometry could provide distinct advantages over classic virus neutralization or FFN assays for the detection and quantitation of neutralizing antibody.","Sarmento, Luciana V; Poonsuk, Korakrit; Tian, Liying; Mora-Díaz, Juan C; Main, Rodger G; Baum, David H; Zimmerman, Jeffrey J; Giménez-Lirola, Luis G","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://doi.org/10.1177/1040638720903346; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32065056/,8
155867,Safety and efficacy of endoscopic submucosal dissection for rectal neoplasia: a multicenter North American experience.,2019-12-01,"Sutures are commonly used for surgical procedures and new sutures are being developed to improve wound healing. In the past decade, it has been extensively shown that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have a wound healing potential. To benefit the overall wound healing process, we aimed to analyze the usage of pretreated sutures for improving the implantation of MSCs in the tissues. Our results firstly showed that suture pretreatments with gelatin, poly-L-lysine, and NaOH improved the adhesive strength of MSCs to sutures. These cells remained surrounding the sutured tissue and no significant phenotypic changes were found in those cells cultured onto pretreated sutures. In vivo experiments showed that the implantation of MSCs by suturing increases the collagen content in the sutured tissue. Moreover, proteomics analysis of secreted proteins showed that collagen alpha-1(I) chain was the most abundant collagen found. To our knowledge, this is the first report that aimed to improve the implantation of MSCs in tissue by suture pretreatments. Moreover, in vivo experiments suggest that MSC-coated sutures may enhance wound healing and tissue remodeling through the release of different collagen types being applicable for those patients that tend to have difficulty healing.","Casado, Javier G; Blazquez, Rebeca; Jorge, Inmaculada; Alvarez, Veronica; Gomez-Mauricio, Guadalupe; Ortega-Muñoz, Mariano; Vazquez, Jesus; Sanchez-Margallo, Francisco M",Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/wrr.12153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24635176/,8
156531,Remote Patient Monitoring - Overdue or Overused?,2021-04-15,"We conducted a meta-analysis comparing the efficacy of laparoscopic suturing with or without barbed suture for myomectomy or hysterectomy. We used a systematic electronic search strategy of published literature using the following databases: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, Embase, and OVID MEDLINE In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations databases. The following medical subject heading terms, key words, and their combinations were used: laparoscopy, myomectomy, hysterectomy, and barbed suture. Studies in which women undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy or hysterectomy using barbed suture or conventional suture were selected. The main outcome measures chosen for the current meta-analysis were operative time, suturing time, estimated blood loss or change in hemoglobin level, and degree of suturing difficulty. The results of the meta-analysis studies were expressed as the standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Compared with the use of conventional suture, the total operative time of laparoscopic myomectomy (SMD = -0.58; 95% CI, -0.88 to -0.28) and the suturing time to close the uterine incision (SMD = -1.38; 95% CI, -1.86 to -0.90) were significantly reduced with the use of barbed suture. Meta-analysis on laparoscopic hysterectomy shows that the time to suture the vaginal vault, the total operative time, and the estimated blood loss were comparable with or without the use of barbed suture. The degree of suturing difficulty was reported in 2 randomized trials. Compared with the use of conventional suture, the degree of suturing difficulty was lower with the use of barbed suture (SMD = -1.39; 95% CI, -1.83 to -0.95). The use of barbed suture facilitates laparoscopic suturing of myomectomy incision and closure of the vaginal vault. Its use is associated with a reduced operative time of laparoscopic myomectomy.","Tulandi, Togas; Einarsson, Jon I",Journal of minimally invasive gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jmig.2013.09.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24126257/,8

Indeed, to prevent spreading of CoViD-19 infection among extremely fragile dialysis patients, as well as among dialysis workers, hemodialysis (HD) centers are adopting specific procedures (""dedicated"" dialysis facilities, portable osmosis, etc.) with a great economic and organizational commitment. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) represents a type of home dialysis therapy not yet adequately implemented to date, in spite of safe and simple practice, as well as similar dialytic efficiency vs in-center hemodialysis. Remote patient monitoring (RPM) systems have been developed in automated PD (APD) cyclers in order to improve the acceptance of this dialysis method, to increase the compliance to the prescribed therapy and to control treatment adequacy. In this review we assess the potential advantages of RPM in APD, that are the chance for patients to acquire greater independence and safety in the home treatment, to allow better access to care for residents in remote areas, faster resolution of problems, reduction in hospitalizations and mortality rates, as well as time and cost saving for both the patient and the staff. The use of medical devices (sphygmomanometer, glucometer, balance, etc.), connected by wireless to the clinician's portal, might also allow a wider diffusion of incremental dialysis, an integrated therapy that combines conservative management of ESKD patients with a soft dialysis based on the residual kidney function and symptomatology, with potential prognosis and economic benefits. Although the majority of the studies are small and observational, a wider use of RPM systems is desirable to broaden the spread of home dialysis, as we learnt from Coronavirus pandemic.","Borrelli, Silvio; Frattolillo, Vittoria; Garofalo, Carlo; Provenzano, Michele; Genualdo, Raffaele; Conte, Giuseppe; Minutolo, Roberto; De Nicola, Luca",Recenti progressi in medicina,https://doi.org/10.1701/3407.33922; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32658879/,8

Changes in the diurnal rhythm of salivary cortisol (a marker of HPA axis functioning) and alpha-amylase (a marker of ANS functioning) may increase their probability of developing behavior problems. The goal of this study is to examine how these analytes may interact to predict externalizing behavior in infants exposed to early stress. Participants included 179 parents and their 6- to 20-month old infants recruited from a low-income neighborhood. Parents reported on their infants' externalizing behaviors and collected saliva samples from their children at wake-up and bedtime over three days. Diurnal cortisol and alpha-amylase were modeled using latent difference scores. Four models were tested examining the effects of cortisol and alpha-amylase morning values and slopes, as well as their interactions, on externalizing behavior. Results showed a significant interaction effect of cortisol and alpha-amylase morning values, such that low morning cortisol was associated with decreased externalizing behavior when morning alpha-amylase was high but not low. These findings highlight the importance of examining multiple systems when characterizing the physiological correlates of externalizing behavior among infants experiencing adversity.","Frost, Allison; Rodriguez, Melanie; Imrisek, Steven; Dash, Allison; Bernard, Kristin",Developmental psychobiology,https://doi.org/10.1002/dev.22091; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33423285/,8

A 1.5-month-old female infant was admitted to our hospital with sweating and fatigue. Telecardiography showed cardiomegaly, dextrocardia, and increased pulmonary vascular markings. In thoracic computerized tomography, pulmonary sequestration, right pulmonary hypoplasia, and large collateral arteries were seen. The collateral arteries were originating from the celiac trunk and aorta. Echocardiography revealed enlargement of the left atrium and ventricle and left ventricle systolic dysfunction. Angiography revealed a large feeding artery and three branches originating from the aorta and another feeding artery originating from the celiac trunk. We performed embolization of the feeding arteries and their branches, with coils and Onyx. The procedure was performed without complications, and all feeding arteries were completely occluded. The infant started to gain weight. One year later, the infant's body weight had increased and she had no respiratory problems or signs of congestive heart failure. In this case report, we suggest that embolization with Onyx is a reliable alternative method to surgery for infants with pulmonary sequestration.

Mutations in genes involved in the basic functions of the visual system give rise to this condition. These mutations can either lead to loss of function or toxic gain of function phenotypes. While autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa caused by loss of function can be ideally treated by gene supplementation with a single vector to address a different spectrum of mutations in a gene, the same strategy cannot be applied to toxic gain of function phenotypes. In toxic gain of function phenotypes, the mutation in the gene results in the acquisition of a new function that can interrupt the functioning of the wildtype protein by various mechanisms leading to cell toxicity, thus making a single approach impractical. This review focuses on the genes and mechanisms that cause toxic gain of function phenotypes associated with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa and provide a bird's eye view on current therapeutic strategies and ongoing clinical trials.","Narasimhan, Ishwarya; Murali, Aishwarya; Subramanian, Krishnakumar; Ramalingam, Sivaprakash; Parameswaran, Sowmya",European journal of ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1177/1120672120957605; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962414/,8

DESIGN population overall mortality data provided by the Italian National Statistical Office (Istat). SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Italian residents 60 years or older from 7,357/7,904 Italian municipalities. For the included municipalities, the number of deaths from any cause from 1 January to 30 May 2020 was available for each day of the 2015-2020 period. Data were stratified by gender, 4 age categories (60-69, 70-79, 80-89, 90+), week, and province. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES province- and gender-specific weekly RR curves (age category vs RR), obtained for 13 weeks between 26 February and 26 May; excess mortality; time-varying/weekly classification of provinces. RESULTS these results provide a weekly classification of the Italian provinces based on their RR curves in 5 groups, 2 of which had high and very high excess mortality during the epidemics. Most of the provinces that appeared at least once in the highest-risk group are neighbouring provinces in the Northern Regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, and Marche (in central Italy), where most of the COVID-19 cases and deaths were identified. Temporally, most of these provinces remained in the highest-risk group for 4 or 5 weeks; those that entered the group later, improved faster. The overall RR curves for groups differed in magnitude, but also in the shape, which varied markedly also between men and women and, most importantly, in the highest-risk group. CONCLUSIONS this study gives timely re-analysis of the Istat data at weekly level and provides a classification of the geographical and temporal characteristics of the excess mortality in the Italian provinces during the COVID-19 epidemics. As expected, the used clustering method groups the provinces that have similar RR values in the two gender-specific curves. The results facilitate the presentation of the spatio-temporal mortality patterns of the epidemics and provide evidence of high heterogeneity in the group of provinces that were defined as high-risk groups by others, based on their geographical position or on the time of the observed spread of the virus.","Kejžar, Nataša; Lusa, Lara",Epidemiologia e prevenzione,https://doi.org/10.19191/ep20.5-6.s2.127; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33412819/,8

The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of an antibiotic-loaded cement to reduce the infection rate in primary total knee arthroplasty. METHODS This is a prospective randomized study with 2948 cemented total knee arthroplasties, in which bone cement without antibiotic was used in 1465 knees (the control group) and a bone cement loaded with erythromycin and colistin was used in 1483 knees (the study group). All patients received the same systemic prophylactic antibiotics. The patients were followed for a minimum of twelve months. The rate of infection was analyzed according to the criteria of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RESULTS The rate of deep infection (1.4% in the control group and 1.35% in the study group; p = 0.96) and the rate of superficial infection (1.2% and 1.8%, respectively; p = 0.53) were similar in both groups. The factors related to a higher rate of deep infection in a multivariate analysis were male sex and an operating time of >125 minutes. CONCLUSIONS The use of erythromycin and colistin-loaded bone cement in total knee arthroplasty did not lead to a decrease in the rate of infection when systemic prophylactic antibiotics were used, a finding that suggests that the use of antibiotic-loaded bone cement would not be indicated in the general population. Further research is needed to assess whether its use is recommended for patients with a higher risk of infection.","Hinarejos, Pedro; Guirro, Pau; Leal, Joan; Montserrat, Ferran; Pelfort, Xavier; Sorli, M L; Horcajada, J P; Puig, Lluis",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

With exception of the Swedish Obesity Subjects (SOS) study, these studies have been surgical case series, comparison of surgery types, or surgery patients compared to subjects enrolled in planned nonsurgical intervention. This study measured gastric bypass effectiveness when compared to two separate severely obese groups not participating in designed weight-loss intervention. Three groups of severely obese subjects (N = 1,156, BMI >or= 35 kg/m(2)) were studied: gastric bypass subjects (n = 420), subjects seeking gastric bypass but did not have surgery (n = 415), and population-based subjects not seeking surgery (n = 321). Participants were studied at baseline and 2 years. Quantitative outcome measures as well as prevalence, incidence, and resolution rates of categorical health outcome variables were determined. All quantitative variables (BMI, blood pressure, lipids, diabetes-related variables, resting metabolic rate (RMR), sleep apnea, and health-related quality of life) improved significantly in the gastric bypass group compared with each comparative group (all P < 0.0001, except for diastolic blood pressure and the short form (SF-36) health survey mental component score at P < 0.01). Diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension resolved much more frequently in the gastric bypass group than in the comparative groups (all P < 0.001). In the surgical group, beneficial changes of almost all quantitative variables correlated significantly with the decrease in BMI.

METHODS A retrospective analysis of 50 patients with HCC treated with CEUS guided RFA using perflutren at our institution was performed. CEUS images were first compared to B-mode US images performed at the same RFA session to determine the ability of CEUS to increase the conspicuity of lesions. A qualitative score (1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = excellent) was used to grade the ability to visualize the lesions. The preprocedure CEUS images were then evaluated using the most recent prior contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The efficacy of the treatment was evaluated with short-term follow-up imaging (median 1 month) for presence of residual or recurrent disease. RESULTS CEUS allows at least fair visualization (score ≥2) in 78% (reader 1) and 80% (reader 2) of the lesions not visualized by B-mode US, and 50% (reader 1) and 42% (reader 2) of the lesions poorly visualized by B-mode US. Lesion appearances on CEUS are largely concordant with those on CT or MRI: 88% for reader 1, 96% for reader 2. With CEUS-guided RFA, complete response was achieved in the vast majority of the lesions at short-term follow-up: 82% for reader 1, 94% for reader 2. CONCLUSIONS CEUS increases the conspicuity and provides better characterization of hypervascular HCC that are either not seen or poorly seen on B-mode US, and CEUS provides real-time guidance of RFA with good short-term treatment responses.","Chan, Andy K W; Hegarty, Chris; Klass, Darren; Yoshida, Eric; Chung, Stephen; Liu, David M; Ho, Stephen G F; Harris, Alison C",Canadian Association of Radiologists journal = Journal l'Association canadienne des radiologistes,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.carj.2014.11.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25637354/,8
160885,Issue Highlights.,2020-09-01,"INTRODUCTION Conventional laparoscopic procedures have been used for splenic diseases and concomitant gallbladder stones, frequently in patients with hereditary spherocytosis since 1990's. The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of single-site surgery with conventional instruments in combined procedures. PRESENTATION OF CASE SERIES Six consecutive patients who scheduled for combined cholecystectomy and splenectomy because of hereditary spherocytosis or autoimmune hemolytic anemia were included this study. Both procedures were performed via trans-umbilical single-site multiport approach using conventional instruments. All procedures completed successfully without conversion to open surgery or conventional laparoscopic surgery. An additional trocar was required for only one patient. The mean operation time was 190min (150-275min). The mean blood loss was 185ml (70-300ml). Median postoperative hospital stay was two days. No perioperative mortality or major complications occurred in our series. Recurrent anemia, hernia formation or wound infection was not observed during the follow-up period. DISCUSSION Nowadays, publications are arising about laparoscopic or single site surgery for combined diseases. Surgery for combined diseases has some difficulties owing to the placement of organs and position of the patient during laparoscopic surgery. Single site laparoscopic surgery has been proposed to have better cosmetic outcome, less postoperative pain, greater patient satisfaction and faster recovery compared to standard laparoscopy. CONCLUSION We consider that single-site multiport laparoscopic approach for combined splenectomy and cholecystectomy is a safe and feasible technique, after gaining enough experience on single site surgery.","Ozemir, Ibrahim Ali; Bayraktar, Baris; Bayraktar, Onur; Tosun, Salih; Bilgic, Cagri; Demiral, Gokhan; Ozturk, Erman; Yigitbasi, Rafet; Alimoglu, Orhan",International journal of surgery case reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijscr.2015.12.018; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26708949/,8

We retrospectively analyzed the differences between patients with nosocomial COVID-19 and either hematological disease (n=40) or other diseases (n=57). The analysis was completed within 60 days for surviving patients. Among the patients with hematological disease and those with other diseases, there were 21 (52.5%) and 20 (35.1%) deaths, respectively. Although the patients with hematological disease received favipiravir more frequently than patients with other diseases (21 [52.5%] vs. 15 [35.3%], respectively; P<0.05), their median overall survival was poor (29 days; P=0.078). Furthermore, the median duration from oxygen therapy initiation to death or intubation was significantly shorter in the patients with hematological disease (5 days [range, 1-17 days] vs. 10 days [1-24 days], respectively; P<0.05). Furthermore, the patients with hematological disease and nosocomial COVID-19 exhibited more marked respiratory failure and poorer outcomes leading to death in a shorter time period than the patients with other diseases and nosocomial COVID-19.","Uchida, Tomoyuki; Takagi, Yuki; Mizuno, Akihiro; Okamura, Hayao; Saito, Hiroki; Ide, Shiro; Ohara, Shin; Inoue, Morihiro; Hagihara, Masao",[Rinsho ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology,https://doi.org/10.11406/rinketsu.61.857; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32908046/,8
161357,Lipid-mediated regulation of the cancer-immune crosstalk.,2020-08-15,"BACKGROUND Chorioamnionitis results from an infection of the fetal membranes and is associated with fetal adverse outcomes notably in the intestine. Using a translational ovine model, we showed that intra-amniotic exposure to inflammatory stimuli decreased the regulatory/effector T (Treg/Teff) cell balance in the gut, which was accompanied by intestinal inflammation and mucosal injury. We thus aimed to augment the Treg/Teff cell ratio in the fetal gut by prophylactic IL-2 treatment and evaluate whether it is sufficient to prevent chorioamnionitis-induced intestinal inflammation and mucosal injury. METHODS Fetal sheep (122 d of gestation) were intra-amniotically exposed to lipopolysaccharide for 2 or 7 days with or without prophylactic IL-2 treatment (4 d). We evaluated the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the ileum and mesenteric lymph nodes. Cytokine gene expression was analyzed in fetal ileum and the inflammatory changes were correlated with gut wall integrity. RESULTS IL-2 administration preferentially increased intestinal Treg cells and thus the Treg/Teff cell ratio. Prophylactic IL-2 treatment reduced the lipopolysaccharide-induced influx of neutrophils and CD3(+) T cells and decreased the messenger RNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and IL-17 in the fetal ileum. Importantly, prophylactic IL-2 treatment prevented mucosal damage without inducing fetal adverse treatment outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Our data show that prophylactic IL-2 treatment prevents fetal intestinal inflammation and mucosal injury in the context of experimental chorioamnionitis. Modulation of the Treg/Teff cell balance may contribute to the protective effects of IL-2.","Nikiforou, Maria; Vanderlocht, Joris; Chougnet, Claire A; Jellema, Reint K; Ophelders, Daan R M G; Joosten, Mandy; Kloosterboer, Nico; Senden-Gijsbers, Birgit L M G; Germeraad, Wilfred T V; Kramer, Boris W; Wolfs, Tim G A M",Inflammatory bowel diseases,https://doi.org/10.1097/mib.0000000000000455; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26002542/,8

Challenging ergonomics, instrument clashing, and the lack of true triangluation still remain great concerns. RECENT FINDINGS New technological developments in instrument design have been created to enhance clinical applicability of these techniques. Further technological advancements including the incorporation of novel robotic surgical platforms (R-LESS) exploit the ergonomic benefits in an attempt to further advance LESS surgery. Promising devices include magnetic anchoring and guidance systems that have the potential to allow external manoeuvring of intracorporeal instruments while facilitating triangulation and reducing clashing. As well, the benefit of miniature in-vivo robots that can be placed endoscopically intra-abdominally and controlled wirelessly will allow internal manipulation of tissue from internal repositionable platforms. SUMMARY It remains to be seen whether LESS or NOTES will prove their clinical benefit over standard laparoscopic or robotic procedures. In this chapter, we review the current LESS and NOTES technology, and focus on new innovations and research in the field.","Morgan, Monica; Olweny, Ephrem O; Cadeddu, Jeffrey A",Current opinion in urology,https://doi.org/10.1097/mou.0000000000000012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24253802/,8
161634,Prevalence of Escherichia coli adhesion-related genes in neonatal calf diarrhea in Uruguay.,2016,"There are many situations where resources are distributed between two parties and where the deciding party has information about the initial distribution and can change its outcome, for example, the allocation of budget for funds or bonuses, where the deciding party might have self-interested motives. Although the neural underpinnings of distributional preferences of resources have been extensively studied, it remains unclear if there are different types of distributional preferences and if these types underlie different disposing neural signatures. We used source-localized resting EEG in combination with a data-driven clustering approach to participants' behavior in a distribution game in order to disentangle the neural sources of the different types of distributional preferences. Our findings revealed four behavioral types: Maximizing types always changed initial distributions to maximize their personal outcomes, and compliant types always left initial distributions unchanged. Disadvantage-averse types only changed initial distributions if they received less than the other party did, and equalizing types primarily changed initial distributions to fair distributions. These behavioral types differed regarding neural baseline activation in the right inferior frontal gyrus. Maximizing and compliant types showed the highest baseline activation, followed by disadvantage-averse types and equalizing types. Furthermore, maximizing types showed significantly higher baseline activation in the left orbitofrontal cortex compared to compliant types. Taken together, our findings show that different types of distributional preferences are characterized by distinct neural signatures, which further imply differences in underlying psychological processes in decision-making.","Koch, Katharina; Gianotti, Lorena R R; Hausfeld, Jan; Studler, Mirjam; Knoch, Daria",Journal of cognitive neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn_a_01751; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34424989/,8

The protein was found to be monomeric and the structure consists of two domains, domains 1 and 2, comprising residues 24-184 and 185-268, respectively. The fold of these domains could not be predicted even using state-of-the-art prediction methods, and similarity searches revealed only a very distant homology to known structures, namely to Mog1p/PsbP-like and OmpA-like proteins for the N- and C-terminal domains, respectively. Since PA1624 is only present in an important human pathogen, its unique structure and periplasmic location render it a potential drug target. Consequently, the results presented here may open new avenues for the discovery and design of antibacterial drugs.","Feiler, Christian G; Weiss, Manfred S; Blankenfeldt, Wulf","Acta crystallographica.

161904,New Trends On Biological Activities And Clinical Studies Of Quinolinic Analogues: A Review.,2021-04-14,"The main objective is to define the mortality of patients with cancer admitted to our hospital, their clinical and demographic characteristics, investigate the risk of COVID-19 for patients with cancer, and determine factors that affect the mortality rates of patients with cancer dying of COVID-19. A total of 2401 patients were admitted to our hospital with the diagnosis of COVID-19 from March 11th, 2020, to May 31st, 2020. Ninety-two out of a total of 112 cancer patients were included in this study based on the planned inclusion/exclusion criteria. The clinical, demographic, and laboratory features and treatments provided were studied, and their effect on mortality rates was analyzed. In our study the median age of the patients was 67 years, and 55.4% were male. More than half (56.5%) of our patients had metastasis. The mortality rate was 6.2% in the overall population with COVID-19, whereas it was 23.9% in patients with cancer. The mortality rate in patients with metastasis was statistically significantly higher compared with those without metastasis (34.0% vs. 10.3% P = 0.008). The mortality rate in patients still smoking was statistically significantly higher than in non-smokers (37.5% vs. 12.5% P = 0.033). The mortality rates of patients with high average C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and D-dimer levels were statistically significantly higher than in those without, and the mortality rates of patients with lower average albumin and hemoglobin levels were statistically significantly higher than those without (P < 0.001, P = 0.006, P = 0.041, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.028, respectively). Having metastases concurrent with COVID-19 was a statistically significant factor predictive of prognosis. Also, high CRP, ferritin, LDH, and D-dimer, and low albumin and hemoglobin were related to increased mortality rates. The predictive and prognostic role of possible factors related to prognosis is still unknown and further large, multicenter prospective studies are needed to confirm these results.","Ayhan, Murat; Odabas, Hatice; Turan, Nedim; Ozyukseler, Deniz Tataroglu; Kostek, Osman; Alkan, Gulin; Abamor, Evrim; Yildirim, Mahmut Emre",Journal of chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1080/1120009x.2021.1923153; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34032198/,8

Evidence points to an exaggerated neuroinflammatory response resulting from peripheral systemic inflammation after surgery, with subsequent cytokine-induced glutamatergic excitotoxicity and synaptic impairment. These immunological changes, among many others, are also observed in Alzheimer's disease. Memantine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist commonly used to treat Alzheimer's disease. Surprisingly, little research exists on the role of memantine in preventing POCD. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of memantine on a spectrum of cognitive functions postoperatively. Mice were divided into 3 groups and each received treatment for 4 weeks. Placebo groups received a placebo then underwent either a sham procedure or a laparotomy procedure. The memantine group received memantine hydrochloride then underwent a laparotomy procedure. Cognitive tests were performed on postoperative days (POD) 1 and 7. Compared to sham-operated mice, placebo groups that underwent a laparotomy procedure showed impaired memory in the Morris water maze test, higher anxiety-like behavior in the open field and the elevated plus maze tests, increased depression-like behavior in the tail suspension test, and lack of preference for social novelty in the three-chamber test. On the other hand, memantine-treated mice that underwent a laparotomy procedure showed enhanced memory on POD7, improved depression-like behavior on POD1 and POD7, enhanced preference for social novelty on POD1, and no improvement in anxiety-like behavior. These findings suggest a potential protective effect of memantine in mice postoperatively on memory, depression-like behavior, and preference for social novelty.","Almahozi, Ahmad; Radhi, Mohamed; Alzayer, Suja; Kamal, Amer",Behavioral sciences,https://doi.org/10.3390/bs9030024; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30845688/,8
163426,Effects of fear factors in disease propagation,2011-12-23,"Breast cancer survival rates have markedly improved. Consequently, survivorship issues have received increased attention. One common sequela of treatment is chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment (CICI). CICI causes a range of impairments that can have a significant negative impact on quality of life. Knowledge of the prevalence of this condition is required to inform survivorship plans, and ensure adequate resource allocation and support is available for sufferers. Objective To estimate the prevalence of cognitive impairment following chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer. Methods Medline, Scopus, CINAHL and PSYCHInfo were searched for eligible studies which included prevalence data on CICI, as ascertained though the use of self-report, or neuropsychological tests. Methodological quality of included studies was assessed. Findings were synthesised narratively, with meta-analyses being used to calculate pooled prevalence when impairment was assessed by neuropsychological tests. Results and discussion The review included 52 studies. Time-points considered ranged from the chemotherapy treatment period to greater than 10 years after treatment cessation. Summary prevalence figures (across time-points) using self-report, short cognitive screening tools and neuropsychological test batteries were 44%, 16% and 21-34% respectively (very low GRADE evidence). Conclusion Synthesised findings demonstrate that 1 in 3 breast cancer survivors may have clinically significant cognitive impairment. Prevalence is higher when self-report based on patient experience is considered. This review highlights a number of study design issues that may have contributed to the low certainty rating of the evidence. Future studies should take a more consistent approach to the criteria used to assess impairment. Larger studies are urgently needed.","Whittaker, A. L.; George, R.

163448,2021 Update: Development of COVID‐19 Therapies from Birthing Tissues and Cord Blood,2021,"Purpose: COVID-19 impacts different groups and subsectors of tourism unevenly, with massive vulnerabilities in tourism operating systems among urban tourism areas. Different types of COVID-19 related crises depend on isolation or returning to “normal” in various urban areas. Boosting domestic tourism activities to spark resilience before international demand returns is essential to stimulating local demand worldwide. This paper aims to build upon a non-exhaustive review of the scientific literature about tourism resilience issues to see the bigger picture of tourism resilience on three levels worldwide. Design/methodology/approach: This research applies a content analysis technique to collect research data from the latest scientific papers on tourism resilience issues. This study will use searching and filtering on the Scopus web database and based on the VOSviewer algorithm to identify useful insights and determine a framework for tourism resilience issues on three levels. Findings: The outcome of three aspects of resilience, which mainly relate to the development of tourism industry sectors (transportation, accommodation, food and beverage) and other industries (research and education) connected to urban tourism resilience, could be useful for future researchers to explore less-studied issues and policymakers’ future application. Research limitations/implications: The research data are mostly from literature reviews of papers that may not interpret all contemporary resilience issues and the research data are based on urban areas alone. Originality/value: The research idea is fresh and adds new knowledge to professionals’ or policymakers’ future applications. © 2021, International Tourism Studies Association.","P.L, B.; Tzu-Ling Chen, C.; Wickens, E.",International Journal of Tourism Cities,https://doi.org/10.1108/ijtc-12-2020-0289,8

METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted at Obstetrics & Gynecology units Hayatabad Medical Complex Peshawar from May 12th, 2020, to November 29th, 2020, screening and testing of patients admitted for childbirth was in HMC. Screening consisted of questions related to travel, contacts, and symptoms of COVID-19. All patients without a prior diagnosis of COVID-19 underwent SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of nasopharyngeal swabs, with rapid testing available. Patients scheduled for cesarean birth were screened and tested at preoperative visits RESULTS: One hundred eighty-two patients presenting for antenatal visits were screened;6.5% (12 out of 182) were previously diagnosed with COVID-19. The remaining 170 patients were tested at admission, and 17.6% (30 out of 170) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Twenty-two of the 30 who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (73.3%) were asymptomatic. The overall prevalence of positive test results among asymptomatic patients was 14.1% (22 out of 156). The prevalence of positive test results among asymptomatic patients increased from 1.29% (2 out of 155). CONCLUSION: The evidence on this novel infection is changing almost daily, although it will likely be many months before, we can determine the true impact it will have on both maternal and fetal well-being. In the interim, our primary responsibility is to ensure all women have access to safe maternity services.","Rabeea, Sadaf Muhammed Zahid Nasreen Kishwar Umaiyma Farhad Khalil B.

One of the greatest barriers to the development of effective therapeutic agents to treat influenza, coronaviruses, and many other infections of the respiratory tract is the absence of a robust preclinical model. Preclinical studies currently rely on high-throughput, low-fidelity in vitro screening with cell lines and/or low-throughput animal models that often provide a poor correlation to human clinical responses. Here, we introduce a human primary airway epithelial cell-based model integrated into a high-throughput platform where tissues are cultured at an air-liquid interface (PREDICT96-ALI). We present results on the application of this platform to influenza and coronavirus infections, providing multiple readouts capable of evaluating viral infection kinetics and potentially the efficacy of therapeutic agents in an in vitro system. Several strains of influenza A virus are shown to successfully infect the human primary cell-based airway tissue cultured at an air-liquid interface (ALI), and as a proof-of-concept, the effect of the antiviral oseltamivir on one strain of Influenza A is evaluated. Human coronaviruses NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and SARS-CoV-2 enter host cells via ACE2 and utilize the protease TMPRSS2 for protein priming, and we confirm expression of both in our ALI model. We also demonstrate coronavirus infection in this system with HCoV-NL63, observing sufficient viral propagation over 96 hours post-infection to indicate successful infection of the primary cell-based model. This new capability has the potential to address a gap in the rapid assessment of therapeutic efficacy of various small molecules and antiviral agents against influenza and other respiratory viruses including coronaviruses.","Gard, A.L.; Maloney, R.; Cain, B.P.; Miller, C.R.; Luu, R.J.; Coppeta, J.R.; Liu, P.; Wang, J.P.; Azizgolshani, H.; Fezzie, R.F.; Balestrini, J.L.; Isenberg, B.C.; Finberg, R.W.; Borenstein, J.T.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.05.23.112797,8

Neither mobility studies nor other research fields had foreseen this kind of scenario in their mobility and migration models. In the past decades, the belief in unconstrained mobility, as well as the practice of mobility and its scientific modelling, relied on the idea of unbounded growth at the sub-national, national and supra-national level. The article focuses on immigration to Norway, showing how institutional constraints were used to deal with the spread of COVID-19 and how they affected immigration to the country.Due to complexity reasons, we focus exclusively on the situation of asylum seekers, giving additional attention to unaccompanied minors. These groups’ migration status is assumed to make them especially susceptible to the newly established immigration measures.

167818,The OncoSim-Breast cancer microsimulation model,2020-05-24,"Viruses circulating in wild and domestic animals pose a constant threat to human health1. Identifying human genetic factors that protect against zoonotic infections is a health priority. The RD-114 and Type-D retrovirus (RDR) interference group includes infectious viruses that circulate in domestic cats and various Old World monkeys (OWM), and utilize ASCT2 as a common target cell receptor2. While human ASCT2 can mediate RDR infection in cell culture, it is unknown whether humans and other hominoids encode factors that restrict RDR infection in nature2,3. Here we test the hypothesis that Suppressyn, a truncated envelope protein that binds ASCT2 and is derived from a human endogenous retrovirus4,5, restricts RDR infection. Transcriptomics and regulatory genomics reveal that Suppressyn expression initiates in the preimplantation embryo. Loss and gain of function experiments in cell culture show Suppressyn expression is necessary and sufficient to restrict RDR infection. Evolutionary analyses show Suppressyn was acquired in the genome of a common ancestor of hominoids and OWMs, but preserved by natural selection only in hominoids. Restriction assays using modern primate orthologs and reconstructed ancestral genes indicate that Suppressyn antiviral activity has been conserved in hominoids, but lost in most OWM. Thus in humans and other hominoids, Suppressyn acts as a restriction factor against retroviruses with zoonotic capacity. Transcriptomics data predict that other virus-derived proteins with potential antiviral activity lay hidden in the human genome.","Frank, John A.; Singh, Manvendra; Cullen, Harrison B.; Kirou, Raphael A.; Coyne, Carolyn B.; Feschotte, Cédric",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.23.263665,8
168286,Pharmacological activities and potential use of bovine colostrum for peptide-based radiopharmaceuticals: A review,2021,"ABSTRACT While cash transfers gain prominence as a response to the COVID‐19 pandemic, there is a strong impulse to regard them as a stepping‐stone towards the formalization of employment and universalization of social protection. This contribution problematizes how populations in informality are included in narrowly targeted social assistance interventions, which are heavily reliant on targeted schemes and fail to make informality legible to programme administrators. The focus of the article lies in the politics of exclusion and inclusion that permeate digital infrastructures, particularly data infrastructures such as social registries, that are used to target Ecuador's most prominent social assistance programme, Bono de Desarrollo Humano, and the COVID‐related programme Bono de Protección Familiar. The article is based on ethnographic work, interviews and narrative analysis. It finds that social registries compiled for proxy means testing weaken the link between eligibility and informal employment and obscure the processes that perpetuate precarity. More recent data innovations, such as machine learning, are also insufficient to locate vulnerable workers as they learn from historical social registries data and replicate their biases, for example by overlooking non‐poor areas where informal employment also occurs. Data infrastructures have shifted attention to the technicalities of the selection of beneficiaries and away from power imbalances in the design of social assistance, despite their selectivity and politics.

While accumulating evidences have shown the importance of the reward system in encoding specific aspects of social interaction, the consequences of social isolation on the reward system and the development of social skills later in adulthood are still largely unknown. Here, we found that one week of social isolation during adolescence in mice increased social interaction at the expense of social habituation and social novelty preference. Behavioural changes were accompanied by the acute hyperexcitability of dopamine (DA) neurons in the ventral segmental area (VTA) and long-lasting expression of GluA2-lacking AMPARs at excitatory inputs onto DA neurons that project to the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Social isolation-dependent behavioural deficits and changes in neural activity and synaptic plasticity were reversed by chemogenetic inhibition of oxytocin neurons in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus. These results demonstrate that social isolation has acute and long-lasting effects on social interaction and suggest that these effects are mediated by homeostatic adaptations within the reward circuit.","Musardo, Stefano; Contestabile, Alessandro; Mairesse, Jerome; Baud, Olivier; Bellone, Camilla",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.06.459105,8
169040,A quantitative trait variant in Gabra2 underlies increased methamphetamine stimulant sensitivity,2021-06-30,"Background: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, all patients attending ambulatory clinic at cancer centers in Ontario, Canada completed the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS), as per governmental cancer agency mandate. At our center, completion was via touch pad, with assistance by clinic volunteers. As of mid-March 2020, clinic appointments were conducted virtually whenever possible, and touch pads removed from clinic. Our purpose here was to explore how these changes impacted the collection of patient-reported outcomes, in particular the recognition of severe symptoms. Methods: We performed a prospective cross-sectional cohort study to test the feasibility of remote completion of the ESAS by patients scheduled for appointments at a weekly surgical oncology clinic at a major cancer center. Patients were identified serially based on date of clinic appointment. Patients in the initial study cohort were asked to complete and return the ESAS virtually (V). Given low completion rates, the ensuing study cohort was asked to complete a hard-copy (HC) ESAS. For the final cohort, we used an adaptive approach, providing remote, personal mentoring by a member of the health care team to support virtual ESAS completion (virtualmentored, VM). Results: Between May-July 2020, a total of 174 patients were included in the study: 53% were female, and median age was 62 (19-90) yrs. Age, gender and tumor site did not differ between the three cohorts. For the V cohort, 20/43 patients successfully completed and returned the ESAS electronically (completion rate 44%). For the HC cohort, 49/50 completed the form (98%). For the VM cohort (n=78), the completion rate was 74%. Questionnaire completion was not predicted by age, gender or tumor site, although patients who completed the ESAS were more likely to be under active investigation/treatment vs. surveillance (p=.04). Of the 127 ESAS forms completed in all patient cohorts, 117 reported at least 1 symptom score ≥1. There were no significant differences in individual symptom scores (e.g. tiredness, wellbeing-see Table) reported between cohorts. Of all completed forms, 42% had a depression score ≥2 and 27% an anxiety score ≥4, indicating significant psychosocial distress. Conclusions:We have identified significant barriers to the virtual completion of ESAS forms, with lack of predictive variables. The severe degree of psychological distress reported by∼50% of respondents demonstrates the need for ongoing regular collection and review of these data.","Kazazian, K.; Bogach, J.; Johnston, W.; Swallow, C.

The CXC-chemokine sub-family is characterized by four cysteine amino acids that form two pairs of disulfide bridges, with the two cysteines proximal to the N-terminus separated by an additional amino acid (CXC). Members of the CXC-chemokine family can be further characterized based on the presence or absence of a Glu-Leu-Arg motif, known as the ‘ELR’ motif. ELR+ CXC-chemokines are angiogenic and preferentially promote the chemoattraction of neutrophils, while ELR- CXC-chemokines are angiostatic and preferentially promote lymphocyte migration. However, all CXC-chemokines stimulate the migration of several leukocytes through the activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs, known as CXCRs). CXC-chemokines also promote cell survival, activate various leukocyte effector functions and induce gene expression. CXC-chemokines have therefore been associated with the pathogenesis of several respiratory diseases including asthma, COPD, IPF, ARDS, cancer and infectious diseases.","Williams, Andrew",Encyclopedia of Respiratory Medicine (Second Edition),https://doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-08-102723-3.00252-3,8

170548,DNA barcoding reveals ongoing immunoediting of clonal cancer populations during metastatic progression and in response to immunotherapy,2021-01-11,"Introduction: Medical education today is equipped with an armamentarium of newer online-based methods of correspondence courses, computerized virtual patient simulation, many open online courses in medical sciences, and tele-learning. The sudden, unplanned change from conventional teaching to online teaching during COVID-19 poses unique challenges and opportunities for teachers and learners, both. Many themes and principles have emerged for good online teaching learning and assessment practices (GOTLAP). Materials and Methods: The present study, involving 392 MBBS first year students from two universities, was conducted with an aim of comparing students' perception regarding online and offline teaching methodology, and online v/s offline method of assessment and to recommend the principles of GOTLAP. Data collected were analyzed by Strength, Weakness, Opportunity, and Threat (SWOT) analysis to provide a focused measure on how students perceive the program of online teaching and assessment. Results: In the present study, majority of the students (approximately 49.6%) have shown preference for offline teaching methodology, 22.9% has shown similar preference for both methods, while 27.5% has shown preference for the offline teaching method. SWOT analysis applied on qualitative data is a useful tool for assessing our present status in online learning and laying a ground work for formulating GOTLAP and a plan of future strategy. Conclusions: The GOTLAP principles can effectively pave way for the incorporation of blended learning (currently underutilized) in undergraduate medical education.","Bhardwaj, Rashmi Hathila Shital Joshi Himanshu Vaniya V.",Acta Medica International,https://doi.org/10.4103/amit.amit_34_21,8

Simultaneously, the fear of infection can discourage patients from seeking necessary care.ObjectivesWe aim to compare sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of inpatients admitted during the COVID-19 confinement period in Portugal vs. inpatients admitted in the same period the previous year.MethodsRetrospective observational study of inpatients admitted between March 19th 2020 and May 1st 2020 and the analog period of 2019 in a psychiatry inpatient unit of a tertiary hospital. Descriptive analysis of the results was performed using the SPSS software, version 26.0.ResultsDuring the lockdown period, there were 30 admissions to the psychiatry inpatient unit, 55.2% less than the same period last year (n=67). The proportion of compulsory admissions and the average length of stay did not differ between the two periods. Regarding sociodemographic characteristics, in the confinement period inpatients were similar to the ones in the same period of 2019. In both periods, the majority of patients had previous psychiatric history (lockdown vs. same period last year: 95.5% and 90.0%) and a similar proportion of readmissions rate (previous year) was similar in the two groups (49.9% vs 47.6%). At discharge, the most frequent diagnostic groups were mood disorders (33.3% (n=10) and 34.3% (n=23)) and schizophrenia, schizotypal and delusional disorders (26,7% (n=8) and 31.3% (n=21)).ConclusionsAlthough there was an expressive reduction of admissions to the psychiatry inpatient unit during lockdown, the clinical characteristics of these patients were analogous to the same period in the previous year.","Vieira, A.; Andrade, F.; Machado, A.

171770,Multiple memories can be simultaneously reactivated during sleep as effectively as a single memory,2020-10-13,"Prior research often finds increased altruism following natural disasters. One explanation is the social heuristic hypothesis: humans are prosocial by nature but become self-interested when they have the opportunity to deliberate. As the stress of a disaster lowers people's ability to engage in effortful deliberation, their heuristic prosocial tendencies emerge. However, this link has often been explored with very simple tasks like the dictator game. Here we study the impact of COVID-related stress on outcomes in multi-issue negotiations with a computational virtual agent. These tasks are interesting because they share some of the characteristics of dictator games (some pot of resources must be divided) but they also involve presumably effortful perspective taking (that can grow the size of the pot). Furthermore, the interaction of humans with virtual agents allows us to explore the extent to which humans apply the CASA (computers as social actors) paradigm to negotiation when under considerable stress. In two experiments with a virtual negotiation partner, we provide evidence for two distinct pathways for how COVID-19 stress shapes prosocial behavior. Consistent with the social heuristic hypothesis, COVID-stress increases giving, mediated by heuristic thinking. But COVID-stress also seems to enhance information-exchange and perspective taking, which allowed participants to grow more value which they could give away. Our results give new insights into the relationship between stress, cognition, and prosocial behavior. © 2021 ACM.","Mell, J.; Lucas, G.

We find that the stock price crash risk of energy firms significantly decreases in the post-COVID-19 period. We also find that firms that engage in more corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities are less exposed to stock price crash risk in the post-COVID-19 period than those that engage in less CSR activities. Finally, we show that the effect of COVID-19 on stock price crash risk is less severe for state-owned enterprises (SOEs) than for non-SOEs in the post-COVID-19 period. Our findings demonstrate China's economic recovery in the post-COVID-19 period and have policy implications for firms to improve their resilience to exogenous shocks.","Huang, Shoujun Liu Hezhe",Energy Economics,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2021.105431,8

However, this assumption remains untested. Surface electromyographic signals were collected using two 32-channel electrode matrices placed on soleus and tibialis anterior of 25 older adults (70±4years) and 17 young adults (29±5 years) to investigate motor unit discharge behaviours. Participants performed triangular-shaped plantar and dorsiflexion contractions to 20% of maximum torque at a rise-decline rate of 2%/s of each participant’s maximal torque. Pairwise and composite paired-motor unit analyses were adopted to calculate delta frequency (ΔF), which has been used to differentiate between the effects of synaptic excitation and intrinsic motor neuronal properties and is assumed to be proportional to PIC amplitude. Soleus and tibialis anterior motor units in older adults had lower ΔFs calculated with either the pairwise [−0.99 and −1.46 pps; −35.4 and − 33.5%, respectively] or composite (−1.18 and −2.28 pps; −32.1 and −45.2%, respectively) methods. Their motor units also had lower peak discharge rates (−2.14 and −2.03 pps; −19.7 and −13.9%, respectively) and recruitment thresholds (−1.50 and −2.06% of maximum, respectively) than young adults. These results demonstrate reduced intrinsic motor neurone excitability during low-force contractions in older adults, likely mediated by decreases in the amplitude of persistent inward currents. Our findings might be explained by deterioration in the motor neurones or monoaminergic systems and could contribute to the decline in motor function during ageing; these assumptions should be explicitly tested in future investigations.","Orssatto, Lucas B.

The transportation sector accounts for 15% of total GHG emissions and 23% of CO 2 emissions, of which 30% of CO 2 comes from burning fossil fuels. Government policies in the context of preventing the spread of Covid 19 and enforcement of restrictions on Community Activities (PPKM), have provided benefits for the environment in terms of reducing air pollution by up to 42% (liputan6.com). The Covid 19 pandemic has an impact on the public transportation business, based on sales data from PT KAI (Persero) that there was a decrease in the number of longdistance train passengers using rail transportation services, namely in April 2019 there were 3,879,792 passengers while in April 2020 it fell to 286 268 passengers. This research aims at understanding the risk perception that affects the planned attitudes and behaviour of potential passengers to travel by train during the pandemic. 368 samples were collected from Operation Area 1 to Operation Area 9. Employing SEM analysis with the SmartPLS, the result shows that the customers intend to continue traveling using railway public services. However, a certain level of anxiety and perceived risk grows due to a lack of information. namely, uncertainty whether the use of public transportation may bear the potential for covid 19 transmissions. Hence the government’s actions in dealing with the pandemic could reassure the customers to continue using the railway services.","Nurhadi, Suryadari R. T.",IOP Conference Series.

This study aims to explore the physical, social, and psychological impact of the diagnosis on the individual through online interviews. Method: A qualitative study approach using online interviews was conducted. A sample of 30 participants of different age groups, gender, and nationalities were interviewed to explore the impact of a positive COVID-19 diagnosis on their physical, mental, social, psychological health, and lifestyle practices. An interview guide was created based on coping strategy model and conceptual framework of coping strategies. All interviews were recorded then transcribed after obtaining written consent from participants. Ethics approval was obtained from the United Arab Emirates Social Science Ethics Committee. NVIVO software was used for thematic analysis based on both identified coping models to highlight the most important feelings and emotions, family support, and changes in lifestyle that may impact the COVID-19 patient and family. Researchers identified the themes separately and then verified themes in one meeting. Results: Major themes include the physical effects, social effects, psychological effects, spiritual effects, and lifestyle effects. Emerging themes include coping mechanisms, trust in authorities and health care system, appreciation of the role of the government, conspiracy theories, and media roles. Those who had a positive infection towards the end of 2020 and in 2021 described having fewer negative emotions and better psychological resilience.

Here we describe the feasibility of the Evaluating Diuretics in Normal Care (EVIDENCE) study that compares a thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics for hypertension as an exemplar of a more general framework for efficient generation of such evidence. In 2011, the UK NICE hypertension guideline included a recommendation that thiazide-like diuretics (such as indapamide) be used in preference to thiazide diuretics (such as bendroflumethiazide) for hypertension. There is sparse evidence backing this recommendation, and bendroflumethiazide remains widely used in the UK. Methods Patients prescribed indapamide or bendroflumethiazide regularly for hypertension were identified in participating General Practices. Allocation of a prescribing policy favouring one of these drugs was then randomly applied to the Practice and, where required to comply with the policy, repeat prescriptions switched by pharmacy staff. Patients were informed of the potential switch by letter and given the opportunity to opt-out. Practice adherence to the randomised policy was assessed by measuring the amount of policy drug prescribed as a proportion of total combined indapamide and bendroflumethiazide. Routinely collected hospitalization and death data in the NHS will be used to compare cardiovascular event rates between the two policies. Results This pilot recruited 30 primary care practices in five Scottish National Health Service (NHS) Boards. Fifteen practices were randomised to indapamide (2682 patients), and 15 to bendroflumethiazide (3437 patients); a study population of 6119 patients. Prior to randomisation, bendroflumethiazide was prescribed to 78% of patients prescribed either of these drugs. Only 1.6% of patients opted out of the proposed medication switch. Conclusion The pilot and subsequent recruitment confirms the methodology is scalable within NHS Scotland for a fully powered larger study, currently 102 GP practices (>12,700 patients) are participating in this study. It has the potential to efficiently produce externally valid comparative effectiveness data with minimal disruption to practice staff or patients. Streamlining this pragmatic trial approach, has demonstrated the feasibility of a random prescribing policy design framework that can be adapted to other therapeutic areas.

With the spread of the COVID-19 virus, however, this practice is changing. From discouragement to adoption and promotion, the rise of mask-wearing behaviors is an unusually rapid cultural practice change. Applying a “diffusion of innovations” and “social capital” approach to recent mask mobilization, this study uses content and corpus analysis methods to examine the role played by formal and informal social relationships in the adoption and diffusion of mask wearing as a pandemic preventive behavior. I argue that widespread mask making, organizing, and distribution, and their cascading communication through social networks, played a positive role in this change and further argue that contradictory messaging by social media networks and change agents played a negative role and contributed to anti-mask attitudes and practices. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, J.

RC48-ADC is an innovative HER2-targeting antibody-drug conjugate with a cleavable linker and a potent microtubule inhibitor payload MMAE that has a bystanding effect in tumor cell killing. Methods: C001 CANCER (NCT02881138) was a dose-escalation phase I study (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 mg/kg) with the 3+3 design among HER2-positive patients. C003 CANCER (NCT03052634) was a phase Ib study with 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 mg/kg doses in the HER2-positive subgroup and 2.0 mg/kg dose in both IHC 2+/FISH-, and IHC 1+ HER2-low expressing subgroup. C003 CANCER is currently ongoing for IHC 1+ patients. Pooled analysis of the two studies was conducted for the efficacy and safety of RC48-ADC in HER2-positive or HER2-low expressing subgroups. Results: At the time of data cutoff (December 31, 2020), 118 female breast cancer patients were enrolled and treated with RC48-ADC. 70 patients (59.3%) were HER2-positive and 48 patients (40.7%) were HER2-low expressing. At baseline, 77 patients (65.3%) had liver metastases, 50 patients (42.4%) were ECOG PS 1, 47 patients (39.8%) had received ≥3 prior chemotherapy regimens. In the HER2-positive subgroup, ORRs for 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 mg/kg doses were 22.2% (95% CI: 6.4%, 47.6%), 42.9% (95% CI: 21.8%, 66.0%), and 40.0% (95% CI: 21.1%, 61.3%). mPFSs for 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 mg/kg cohorts were 4.0 months (95% CI: 2.6, 7.6), 5.7 months (95% CI: 5.3, 8.4) and 6.3 months (95% CI: 4.3, 8.8). In the HER2-low expressing subgroup, the ORR and mPFS were 39.6% (95% CI: 25.8%, 54.7%) and 5.7 months (95% CI: 4.1, 8.3). ORR and mPFS for IHC2+/FISH-patients were 42.9% (15/35) and 6.6 months (95% CI: 4.1, 8.5). For IHC1+ patients, even though the COVID-19 pandemic led to treatment postpone for some patients, ORR and mPFS reached 30.8% (4/13) and 5.5 months (95% CI: 2.7, 11.0). The common treatmentrelated adverse events (TRAEs) were AST increased (64.4%), ALT increased (59.3%), hypoesthesia (58.5%), white blood cell count decreased (48.3%), and neutrophil count decreased (47.5%);most were grade 1-2 in severity. Neutrophil count decreased (16.9%), GGT increased (12.7%), and fatigue (11.9%) were the grade 3 and above TRAEs occurring in ≥ 10% of the overall population. Conclusions: RC48-ADC showed consistent efficacy in HER2-positive and HER2-low expressing subgroups. The 2.0 mg/kg Q2W showed a more favorable benefit-risk ratio than other dose levels. No new safety signals were observed. Further studies are initiated to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RC48-ADC in various settings.","Wang, J.; Liu, Y.; Zhang, Q.; Feng, J.; Fang, J.; Chen, X.; Han, Y.; Li, Q.; Zhang, P.; Yuan, P.; Ma, F.; Luo, Y.; Fan, Y.; Cai, R.; Chen, S.; Li, Y.; Xu, B.",Journal of Clinical Oncology,https://doi.org/10.1200/jco.2021.39.15_suppl.1022,8

This article initially sets the general policy context by conducting a benchmarking about the explicit replication strategies followed by each of the 17 ongoing EC-H2020-SCC lighthouse projects. This article aims to shed light on the following research question: Why might replication not be happening among smart cities as a unidirectional, hierarchical, mechanistic, solutionist, and technocratic process? Particularly, in asking so, it focuses on the EC-H2020-SCC Replicate project by examining in depth the fieldwork action research process implemented during 2019 through a knowledge exchange webinar series with participant stakeholders from six European cities-three lighthouse cities (St. Sebastian, Florence, and Bristol) and three follower-fellow cities (Essen, Lausanne, and Nilufer). This process resulted in a City-to-City Learning Programme that reformulated the issue of replication by experimenting an alternative and an enhanced policy approach. Thus, stemming from the evidence-based policy outcomes of the City-to-City Learning Programme, this article reveals that a replication policy approach from the social innovation lenses might be enabled as a multidirectional, radial, dynamic, iterative, and democratic learning process, overcoming the given unidirectional, hierarchical, mechanistic, solutionist, and technocratic approach.","Calzada, I.",Smart Cities,https://doi.org/10.3390/smartcities3030049,8
181842,Polyvalent Guide RNAs for CRISPR Antivirals,2021-02-25,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) examine the association between genotype and phenotype while adjusting for a set of covariates. Although the covariates may have non-linear or interactive effects, due to the challenge of specifying the model, GWAS often neglect such terms. Here we introduce DeepNull, a method that identifies and adjusts for non-linear and interactive covariate effects using a deep neural network. In analyses of simulated and real data, we demonstrate that DeepNull maintains tight control of the type I error while increasing statistical power by up to 20% in the presence of non-linear and interactive effects. Moreover, in the absence of such effects, DeepNull incurs no loss of power. When applied to 10 phenotypes from the UK Biobank (n=370K), DeepNull discovered more hits (+6%) and loci (+7%), on average, than conventional association analyses, many of which are biologically plausible or have previously been reported. Finally, DeepNull improves upon linear modeling for phenotypic prediction (+23% on average).","McCaw, Zachary R.; Colthurst, Thomas; Yun, Taedong; Furlotte, Nicholas A.; Carroll, Andrew; Alipanahi, Babak; McLean, Cory Y.; Hormozdiari, Farhad",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.26.445783,8

Building on this refreshing perspective, in the first part of the book Saraceno, Benassi and Morlicchio introduce an analytical framework evidencing that the interaction among four areas of social regulation – the market, the state, the family, and the community – has generated distinct ‘poverty regimes’ in Europe. [...]the book concludes by emphasizing that recent initiatives in the area of income protection – and, in particular, the adoption of the Citizenship Income – despite some limitations are steps forward for the Italian poverty regime.","Natili, Marcello",Journal of Social Policy,https://doi.org/10.1017/s004727942100057x,8
183410,Binding of sulfonamides to serum proteins: physicochemical and immunochemical studies.,1966,"In the era of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), obstructive lung diseases (OLDs) are common among the people living with HIV (PLWH); however, the mechanism by which HIV induces OLDs is unclear. Although human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) express HIV coreceptors and are critical in regulating lung immune responses, their role in transmitting HIV remains unclear. Herein, we present evidence that HIV-1 infects normal HBECs and the viral DNA is integrated in the genome to establish the viral latency. To prove that HIV productively infects HBECs, we demonstrate: (a) along with CXCR4, HBECs express the HIV-receptor CD4, and are induced to express CCR5 by IL-13 treatment; (b) following infection with HIV, HBECs produce HIV-p24 and contain the latent HIV provirus, which is activated by endotoxin and/or vorinostat; (c) DNA from HIV-1 infected HBECs contains the HIV-specific gag and nef genes, along with Alu sequences, confirming the integration of HIV in the host DNA; (d) the lung epithelial cells of HIV-infected subjects and SHIV-infected cynomolgus macaques are positive for HIV-specific transcripts. Thus, these studies suggest that HIV establishes latency in lung epithelial cells, making them potential HIV reservoirs. The long-living lung epithelial cells, activated by commonly encountered lung infections, might represent an ideal HIV target/reservoir, contributing to OLDs and other HIV-associated lung comorbidities.","Devadoss, Dinesh; Singh, Shashi P.; Acharya, Arpan; Do, Kieu Chinh; Periyasamy, Palsamy; Manevski, Marko; Mishra, Neerad; Tellez, Carmen; Ramakrishnan, Sundaram; Belinsky, Steve; Byrareddy, Siddappa; Buch, Shilpa; Chand, Hitendra S.; Sopori, Mohan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.01.126821,8
183419,Operative techniques in early-stage lung cancer.,2010,"How should we understand the social and political effects of the datafication of human life? This paper argues that the effects of data should be understood as a constitutive shift in social and political relations. We explore how datafication, or quantification of human and non-human factors into binary code, affects the identity of individuals and groups. This fundamental shift goes beyond economic and ethical concerns, which has been the focus of other efforts to explore the effects of datafication and AI. We highlight that technologies such as datafication and AI (and previously, the printing press) both disrupted extant power arrangements, leading to decentralization, and triggered a recentralization of power by new actors better adapted to leveraging the new technology. We use the analogy of the printing press to provide a framework for understanding constitutive change. The printing press example gives us more clarity on 1) what can happen when the medium of communication drastically alters how information is communicated and stored; 2) the shift in power from state to private actors; and 3) the tension of simultaneously connecting individuals while driving them towards narrower communities through algorithmic analyses of data.","Posada, Julian; Weller, Nicholas; Wong, Wendy H.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12731v1.pdf,8

Four institutions (Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), Dartmouth Medical School (DMS), University of Kentucky (UK), and University of California San Diego (UCSD)) worked to adapt ACT network. This paper reports their progress. Materials and Methods: The approach that was taken to enhancing ACT network focused on four activities: cloning and extending the ACT infrastructure, developing an e-phenotype and corresponding registry, developing portable natural language processing (NLP) tools to enhance data capture, and developing automated documentation templates to enhance extended data capture. Results: All four institutions were able to replicate their i2b2 and Shared Health Research Information Network (SHRINE) infrastructure. A five-category e-phenotype model based on ICD-10 coding was developed from prior published work. Ongoing work is refining this via machine learning and artificial intelligence methods. Portable NLP tools, focused on the sentence level, were also developed to identify uncoded opioid overdose-related concepts in provider notes. Optimal performance was seen in NLP tools that combined rule-based with deep learning methods (F score, 0.94). A template for ED overdose documentation was developed to improve primary data capture. Interactive prompts to physicians inside ED progress notes were effective in promoting the use of the template. The template had good system usability and net promoter scores (0.72 and 0.75, respectively, n=13). Discussion: Results suggested that tailoring of existing multipurpose research networks to a specific task is feasible: however, substantial efforts were required for coordination of the subnetwork and development of new tools for extension of available data.","Lenert, L.

Therefore, several countries have recommended replacing the second dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 with an mRNA-based vaccine as a precautionary measure, although data on safety and efficacy of such heterologous prime-boost regimen are sparse. Therefore, vaccinees, who had received a heterologous vaccination using ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 as prime and BNT162b2 (Comirnaty(R), BioNTech-Pfizer) mRNA as boost vaccination were offered SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing to quantify their vaccine-induced neutralizing antibody response. The results were compared to cohorts of healthcare workers or volunteers, who received homologous BNT162b2 or homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination regimens, respectively. A striking increase of vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody activity was observed in 229 vaccinees that received a BNT162b2 boost 9 to 12 weeks after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime. In our cohort comprising over 480 individuals, the heterologous vaccination scheme induced significantly higher neutralizing antibody titers than homologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and even than homologous BNT162b2 vaccination. This proves that a single dose of a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime vaccination is sufficient to achieve high neutralizing antibody levels predicting immune protection from SARS-CoV-2 infection, and may even increase vaccine efficacy offering an alternative in a setting of vaccine shortage.","Tenbusch, M.; Schumacher, S.; Vogel, E.; Priller, A.; Held, J.; Steininger, P.; Beileke, S.; Irrgang, P.; Brockhoff, R.; Salmanton-Garcia, J.; Tinnefeld, K.; Mijocevic, H.; Schober, K.; Bogdan, C.; Yazici, S.; Knolle, P.; Cornely, O.

The global shutting down of non-essential sectors and the maintained global mobility restrictions have led to the industry’s partial closure worldwide. Tourism could play a leading role as the driver for achieving the sustainable development goals (SDG) and as an engine of wealth generation and cultural preservation. However, the negative impacts on the environment have to be considered when shaping the forthcoming and refurbished post-pandemic tourism industry of the future. In this chapter, we propose an environmentally extended input–output model to estimate the tourism carbon footprint to assess the sustainability of the tourism industry and applied it to tourism in Spain. This modelling allows for identifying direct and indirect emissions hot spots along the complex and intricate global value chains. The main results show how while Spain’s tourism contribution to GDP accounts for 12.3%, its carbon footprint accounts for 15% of the Spanish total emissions, which is above the global average (8%). In global terms, 29% of the total carbon footprint is imported, so it is, directly or indirectly, embodied in the global production chains. It is concentrated in some close European Union countries, China, BRIIAT, and the United States. Sectorally, the Spanish tourism carbon footprint is concentrated in some sectors where emissions are mostly domestic (air transport, land transport, or retail trade). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cadarso, M.

Coronavirus-19 disease can lead to stress and anxiety among hospital staff. At present, one of the most important factors affected the occupational performance of the treatment staff and their ability to perform the overshadowed tasks effectively is Covid-19 disease. Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the relationship between job stress and job performance of nurses in the covid-19 epidemic from the perspective of nurses in Zahedan teaching hospitals in 2021. Materials and Methods: This descriptive-analytical study was performed by available sampling method. Data were obtained using forms collected during three months in the inpatient ward of covid-19 in Zahedan teaching hospitals. The research samples were 235 nurses working in different wards of the hospital participated in this study and answered the three-part questionnaire containing demographic and job information, stress resulted by covid-19 and job performance. The collected data were statistically analyzed using SPSS software, version 20. There were used the descriptive and analytical statistics including frequency, mean, standard deviation and t test. Results: Most of the participants in this study were women (68%) under the age of 30 (59.4%). There is a significant relationship between the effect of Covid-19 on job stress and job performance. Thus, the effect of Covid-19 on job stress is direct, i.e. with the greater effect of Covid-19, the amount of stress increases by 39%) p = 0.00, r = 0.39(. The effect of Covid-19 on the job performance was inversely so that with increasing the effect of Covid-19, job performance decreased by -20% (-r= 0.20, p=0.01). The findings showed there is a significant relationship between stress resulted by Covid-19 and the job performance. Discussion: The level of stress in nurses working in Covid-19-related wards in Zahedan teaching hospitals is moderate. It seems that paying attention to nurses' education to deal with critical situations similar to Covid-19 and increasing personal protective equipment can be effective in preventing nurses from developing stress and anxiety, and then their job performance will be improved.","Sheikh, S.; Poudineh, Z.; Sshahbazi, A.; Abdi, Z.",Pakistan Journal of Medical and Health Sciences,https://doi.org/10.53350/pjmhs211551358,8

It spreads exponentially around the world, affects 213 countries and territories as well as two international conveyances. Yet, the pandemic has neither clinically proven drugs nor vaccines. Therefore, it is now evident that non-medical approaches such as deep learning, data mining, expert system, software agents, and other artificial intelligence techniques are urgently needed to combat the pandemic, provide alternative solutions to alleviate the huge burden on the limited health care systems available around the world and curtail the future outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, deep learning (DL) techniques evolved from machine learning (ML) concepts over a period of time and have been amply embraced in many real-life applications because of its unique nature and features for solving problems. Moreover, it is a powerful method of data exploration, and more importantly, has outperformed human efforts in several areas such as computer vision and health-related applications. Therefore, DL can be employed for combating and mitigating the proliferation of COVID-19 virus among humans.

This article, written by three disabled academics based in the UK, reports how during the Coronavirus pandemic, compassion and compassionate spaces could be nurtured when students and staff took the opportunity to recognise their common existence. We share insights from focus groups held with seven disabled academics and learners on their encounters with the pandemic, such as managing the complexities of studying and working from home. We demonstrate that acknowledging and responding compassionately to feelings of vulnerability can offer a lifeline for individuals. Specifically, we propose the application of the social model of disability when seeking to embed compassion in the neoliberal academy. By so doing, the higher education sector can benefit in terms of navigating our extraordinary Coronavirus circumstances, and in building a future inclusive post-pandemic academy.

186047,ACE in COPD: a therapeutic target?,2003,"Posttranslational modification of yeast glycoproteins with alpha 1,3- linked mannose is initiated within a Golgi compartment analogous to the medial Golgi cisternae of higher eukaryotes. We have characterized the synthesis, posttranslational modification, and localization of the yeast alpha 1,3 mannosyltransferase (Mnn1p) using antibodies prepared against a segment of this protein expressed in bacteria. Mnn1p is initially synthesized as a 98.5-kD, type II integral membrane glycoprotein that is modified with both N- and O-linked oligosaccharides. It is subject to a slow, incremental increase in molecular mass that is dependent upon protein transport to the Golgi complex. Self-modification of Mnn1p with alpha 1,3 mannose epitopes, primarily on O-linked oligosaccharides, is at least partly responsible for the incremental increase in molecular mass. Mnn1p is a resident protein of the Golgi complex and colocalizes with guanosine diphosphatase to at least two physically distinct Golgi compartments by sucrose gradient fractionation, one of which may be a late Golgi compartment that also contains the Kex2 endopeptidase. Surprisingly, we found that a significant fraction of Mnn1p is mislocalized to the plasma membrane in a clathrin heavy chain temperature sensitive mutant while guanosine diphosphatase remains intracellular. A mutant Mnn1p that lacks the NH2-terminal cytoplasmic tail is properly localized to the Golgi complex, indicating that clathrin does not mediate Mnnlp Golgi retention by a direct interaction with the Mnn1p cytoplasmic tail. These results indicate that clathrin plays a broader role in the localization of Golgi proteins than anticipated.",,J Cell Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2120240/,8

No antigens cross-reacted between strains, but the electrophoretic patterns against homologous antiserum were highly similar in that both strains had one electrophoretically fast antigen, one of intermediate mobility, and one of slow mobility. Immunization of rabbits with 10(9) plaque-forming units of virus was required for production of antiserum which recognized the three antigens; lesser amounts gave rise to antisera which recognized only one or two components.

HCV elimination is facilitated by well-tolerated, highly effective HCV treatment that requires essentially no on-treatment monitoring in most patients, as highlighted by the MINMON (Minimal Monitoring Study or A5360) study, and that should be increasingly available to children with new data supporting feasible treatment in younger patients. Challenges to HCV elimination include HCV reinfection via sexual exposure in men who have sex with men (MSM) and continued barriers to diagnosis and access to HCV treatment. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) suppression may take years in HIV/HBV-coinfected patients. This may have important consequences as the risk for hepatocellular carcinoma was associated in a dose-dependent manner with HBV viral load and was lowest in those with sustained undetectable HBV, highlighting the need for HBV DNA monitoring during therapy. Public health programs should prioritize improving hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccination in at-risk populations, including people with HIV, as vaccinations rates for these preventable diseases continue to be suboptimal in many settings.

METHODS A prospective evaluation was made of 69 patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy. Preoperative USG was applied to the patients and measurements were taken and recorded of the stomach antrum full layer wall thickness (USGFT) and of mucosal thickness (USGMT). Postoperatively, same parameters were again measured histopathologically and the pathological full thickness (PFT) and pathological mucosal thickness (PMT) values were compared. RESULTS When evaluation was made in respect of USG and pathological measurements, the USGFT was 8.51 ± 3.07 (range 4.5-15.8) and USGMT was 5.80 ± 2.15 (range 2.36-10.5). The PFT was determined as 8.13 ± 2.24 (range 4-14) and PMT as 5.53 ± 1.86 (range 2-10.5). In the histopathological examination, gastritis was seen in 53 (76.8 %) patients and Helicobacter pylori (HP) positivity was determined in 32 (46.4 %) patients. When the patients were grouped as obese (BMI ≤ 49.9 kg/m2) (group 1, n = 50) and super obese (BMI ≥ 50 kg/m2) (group 2, n = 19), no difference was determined between the groups ultrasonographically or histopathologically (p > 0.05). The antrum wall thickness was seen to be significantly greater in the patients with gastritis and HP positivity compared to the patients who were negative. In ROC analysis, cutoff values were calculated for USGFT (5.86 mm) and USGMT (4.49 mm). In gastritis diagnosis, the USGFT cutoff value was found to have 796 % sensitivity and 68.7 % specificity. CONCLUSION USG was seen to be an extremely effective method in visualising the antrum wall and gastritis diagnosis can be made comfortably from the wall thickness measurement.","Yazar, Fatih Mehmet; Baykara, Murat; Karaağaç, Mustafa; Bülbüloğlu, Ertan",Obesity surgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27334646/,8

This study assessed the potential impact of changes inherent in UDHQ implementation on deferral and on prevalence of infectious disease markers among donated units. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS Deferral and donation records were extracted and analyzed for the period of April 1, 2005, to September 30, 2005, after the implementation of the UDHQ and for the same period in the previous year. For comparison, most of the questions in the UDHQ were aligned with corresponding questions in the previous questionnaire, although such alignment could not be exact because of changes in the wording and organization of the questions. RESULTS From 2004 (1 year previously) to 2005 (UDHQ), significant changes in deferral rate were observed for different groups of deferral questions, with the largest being +99.2 percent for ""man who had sex with another man"" and +92.0 percent for ""receipt of blood, tissue, organ, or clotting factor concentrates or a bleeding condition or a blood disease"" among repeat presenters. Changes to the educational material and the wording of questions, elimination of compound questions, and other concurrent changes could have contributed to the changed deferral rates. There was no significant change in prevalence rates of major infectious disease markers. CONCLUSIONS Implementation of the UDHQ impacted on donor deferral, including increased deferral among repeat presenters. No significant impact was observed for infectious disease marker rates.

Here, we present the crystal structure of the secreted, uncleaved ectodomain of the paramyxovirus, human parainfluenza virus 3 fusion (F) protein, a member of the class I viral fusion protein group. The secreted human parainfluenza virus 3 F forms a trimer with distinct head, neck, and stalk regions. Unexpectedly, the structure reveals a six-helix bundle associated with the postfusion form of F, suggesting that the anchor-minus ectodomain adopts a conformation largely similar to the postfusion state. The transmembrane anchor domains of F may therefore profoundly influence the folding energetics that establish and maintain a metastable, prefusion state.","Yin, Hsien-Sheng; Paterson, Reay G; Wen, Xiaolin; Lamb, Robert A; Jardetzky, Theodore S",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15964978/,8
189967,Current awareness in NMR in biomedicine.,1999,"The development of different molecular biology techniques in the past decade has led to an explosion of new research in molecular pathology with consequent important applications to diagnosis, prognosis, and therapeutics, as well as a clearer concept of the disease pathogenesis. Many methods used in molecular pathology are now validated and used in several areas of pathological diagnosis, particularly on infectious and neoplastic diseases. The spectrum of infectious diseases, especially lung infective diseases, is now broadening and modifying, thus the pathologist is increasingly involved in the diagnosis of these pathologies. The precise tissue characterization of lung infections has an important impact on specific therapeutic treatment. Increased knowledge of significant alterations in lung cancer has led today to a better understanding of the pathogenic substrate underlying the development, progression and metastasis of neoplastic processes. Molecular tests are now routinely performed in different lung tumors allowing a more precise patient stratification in terms of prognosis and therapy. This review focuses on molecular pathology of the principal infective lung diseases and tumors.","Calabrese, Fiorella; Lunardi, Francesca; Popper, Helmut",Frontiers in bioscience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25553471/,8
190131,Potential and limitation of UVC irradiation for the inactivation of pathogens in platelet concentrates.,2008,"BACKGROUND The molecular adsorbent recirculating system (MARS) is an albumin-dialysis modality that has been investigated predominantly in patients with acute and acute-on-chronic liver failure. OBJECTIVES To report the clinical efficacy and safety of MARS therapy for intractable pruritus in cholestasis patients with stable chronic liver disease, characterizing the impact of MARS on cytokine levels and on the transcriptome in the blood compartment. METHODS MARS therapy was performed on three patients with cholestatic liver disease using 8 h runs for two consecutive days. The expression levels of 65 cytokines⁄chemokines and 24,000 genes were profiled by Luminex (Luminex Corporation, USA) and microarray, respectively. RESULTS A quality-of-life assessment demonstrated a marked improvement during therapy, which was sustained in two of three patients. No bleeding or infectious complications were observed. Bile acid levels were markedly reduced following MARS (mean [± SD] pretreatment 478.9±112.2 µmol⁄L versus post-treatment 89.7±68.8 µmol⁄L). Concordant decreases in cytokine⁄chemokine levels were noted for interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12 (p40), RANTES, tranforming growth factor-alpha, tumour necrosis factor-alpha and thrombopoietin following MARS. On microarray profiling, biologically relevant concordant changes among all patients were evident for 20 different genes (10 upregulated and 10 downregulated). The upregulation of several potentially immune suppressive⁄regulatory genes (eg, early growth response 3 [EGR-3], ephrin-A2 [EFNA2] and serum amyloid A1 [SAA1]), concurrent with downregulation of genes involved in innate immunity (eg, toll-like receptor 4 interactor with leucine-rich repeats [TRIL]) and inflammation (eg, ephrin receptor B1 [EPHB1]), was observed. CONCLUSIONS This investigative approach offers new insights into intractable pruritus and suggests future therapeutic targets. The clinical benefit of MARS in cholestasis patients with intractable pruritus may not exclusively result from filtration of pruritogens, but also from systemic changes in cytokine⁄chemokine levels and changes in gene expression of blood cells.","Lisboa, Luiz F; Asthana, Sonal; Kremer, Andreas; Swain, Mark; Bagshaw, Sean M; Gibney, Noel; Karvellas, Constantine J",Canadian journal of gastroenterology = Journal canadien de gastroenterologie,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23166903/,8
190607,Influenza.,1891,"INTRODUCTION The repair of large incisional hernias may occasionally lead to a substantial increase in intra-abdominal pressure (IAP), and rarely to abdominal compartmental syndrome (ACS) with subsequent respiratory, vascular, and visceral complications. Measurement of the IAP has recently become a common practice in monitoring critical patients, even though such measurements were obtained in the early 1900s. PATIENTS AND METHODS A prospective study involving 54 patients undergoing elective abdominal wall gap repair (mean length, 17.4 cm) with a tension-free technique after incisional hernia was conducted. The purpose of the study was to determine whether or not urinary pressure for indirect IAP measurement is a reliable method for the early identification of patients with a higher risk of developing ACS. IAP measurements were performed using a Foley catheter connected to a HOLTECH® medical manometer. IAP values were determined preoperatively, after anesthetic induction, upon patient awakening, upon patient arrival in the ward after surgery, and 24 h after surgery before removing the catheter. All patients were treated by the same surgical team using a prosthetic composite mesh (PARIETEX®). RESULTS Incisional hernia repair caused an increase in the mean IAP score of 2.68 mmHg in 47 of 54 patients (87.04%); the IAP was decreased in two patients (3.7%) and remained equal in five patients before and 24 h after surgery (9.26%). FEV-1, measured 24 h after surgery, increased in 50 patients (92.6%), remained stable in two patients (3.7%), and decreased in two patients (3.7%). The mean increase in FEV-1 was 0.0676 L (maximum increase = 0.42 L and minimum increase = 0.01 L) in any patient who developed ACS. CONCLUSIONS Measurement of urinary bladder pressure has been shown to be easy to perform and free of complications. Measurement of urinary bladder pressure can also be a useful tool to identify patients with a higher risk of developing ACS.","Angelici, A M; Perotti, B; Dezzi, C; Amatucci, C; Mancuso, G; Caronna, R; Palumbo, P",Il Giornale di chirurgia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27142823/,8

191807,Viral-induced rhinitis.,1998,"OBJECTIVE to describe the clinical and operative characteristics of patients undergoing laparoscopic myomectomy and use of electromechanical morcellator for removal of tissue. MATERIAL AND METHODS An observational, descriptive and retrospective study was done with the medical records of 65 patients that underwent laparoscopic myomectomy from July 2008 to July 2013. The clinical outcomes, including body mass index (BMI), pregnancies number, parity, previous abortions, indication of myomectomy, surgical findings, length of the procedure, operative bleeding, entry into the endometrial cavity, operative complications and conversion rate to laparotomy were collected and analyzed. RESULTS The mean age and BMI of the patients were 33.1 years and 26.1 kg/m2, respectively. 64% of patients did not have any pregnancy and 33% had a history of one or more abortions. The most frequent indications for myomectomy were infertility (40%) and abnormal uterine bleeding (53%). The most frequent location of the fibroids was the intramural fundal (46%), with an average size of 6.5 cm (SD ± 3.6). The number of myomas extracted ranged from 1 to 6. The mean operative time was 107.8 min (SD ± 27.5) and the operative bleeding was 145.4 mL (SD ± 42.2). There were no operative complications. The conversion rate to laparotomy was 2%. Power morcellation was used in all cases without complications. CONCLUSIONS Laparoscopic myomectomy with electromechanical morcellator for tissue extraction in low risk patients for malignancy is a feasible procedure with a low conversion rate, minimal operative bleeding and the operative time similar to that reported for myomectomy performed by laparotomy.","Morgan-Ortiz, Fred; Soto-Pineda, Juan Manuel; Alejandro Castro-Ibarra,; Morgan-Ruiz, Fred V; Alvear, Humberto Lelevier-de Doig; Báez-Barraza, Josefina",Ginecologia y obstetricia de Mexico,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26591041/,8
192707,"SPECIAL ISSUE: ""FOCUS ON PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY"".",2020,"The subgenomic mRNAs of the coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) are composed of a leader sequence, identical to the 5' 70 nucleotides of the genome, joined at distant downstream sites to a stretch of sequence that is identical to the 3' end of the genome. The points of fusion occur at intergenic sequences (IGSs), loci on the genome that contain a tract of sequence homologous to the 3' end of the leader RNA. We have constructed a mutant of MHV-A59 containing an extra IGS inserted into the genome immediately downstream of the 3'-most gene, that encoding the nucleocapsid (N) protein. We show that in cells infected with the mutant, there is synthesis of an additional leader-containing subgenomic RNA of the predicted size. Our study demonstrates that (i) an IGS can be a sufficient cis-acting element to dictate MHV transcription, (ii) the relative efficiency of an IGS must be influenced by factors other than the nucleotides immediately adjacent to the 5'AAUCUAAAC3' core consensus sequence or its position relative to the 3' end of the genome, (iii) a downstream IGS can exert a polar attenuating effect on upstream IGSs, and (iv) unknown factors prevent the insertion of large exogenous elements between the N gene and the 3' untranslated region of MHV.

Background The ongoing coronavirus outbreak is an important threat to health worldwide. Epidemiological data representing greater risk of liver failure in patients infected with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Methods Electronic databases were comprehensively searched using Medline, ISI Web of Science, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library up to July 2020. Outcomes from each relevant study were pooled using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was analyzed by Q test and I2 statistics. Sensitivity analysis was also evaluated. Results A total of 24 studies were included (4,246 patients) in this study. We found a significant association of COVID-19 severity with increased levels of ALT [SMD: 1.40 U/L; 95% CI (0.93, 1.88); P < 0.05, I2 = 96.5%, P Heterogenity = 0.000 ], AST [SMD: 2.11 U/L; 95% CI (1.40, 2.83); P < 0.05, I2 = 97.9%, P Heterogenity = 0.000], LDH [SMD: 3.88 U/L; 95% CI (2.70, 5); P < 0.05, I2 = 98.7%, P Heterogenity = 0.000] and TBil [SMD: 1.08 mol/L; 95% CI (0.44, 1.72); P = 0.001, I2 = 97.7, P Heterogenity = 0.000], whereas, ALP values [SMD: 0.31; 95% CI (-1.57, 2.20); P = 0.74] was not significant between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients. Moreover, elevated liver enzymes were found more in males [OR: 1.52, (95% CI 1.26, 1.83), P < 0.05] with severe COVID-19 infection than in females.

193119,"Barrett Esophagus: Prevalence, Treatment, and the Link to Esophageal Adenocarcinoma.",2015,"Gene therapy for cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease requires efficient gene transfer to airway epithelial cells after intralumenal delivery. Most gene transfer vectors so far tested have not provided the efficiency required. Although human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a common respiratory virus, is known to infect the respiratory epithelium, the mechanism of infection and the epithelial cell type targeted by RSV have not been determined. We have utilized human primary airway epithelial cell cultures that generate a well-differentiated pseudostratified mucociliary epithelium to investigate whether RSV infects airway epithelium via the lumenal (apical) surface. A recombinant RSV expressing green fluorescent protein (rgRSV) infected epithelial cell cultures with high gene transfer efficiency when applied to the apical surface but not after basolateral inoculation. Analyses of the cell types infected by RSV revealed that lumenal columnar cells, specifically ciliated epithelial cells, were targeted by RSV and that cultures became susceptible to infection as they differentiated into a ciliated phenotype. In addition to infection of ciliated cells via the apical membrane, RSV was shed exclusively from the apical surface and spread to neighboring ciliated cells by the motion of the cilial beat. Gross histological examination of cultures infected with RSV revealed no evidence of obvious cytopathology, suggesting that RSV infection in the absence of an immune response can be tolerated for >3 months. Therefore, rgRSV efficiently transduced the airway epithelium via the lumenal surface and specifically targeted ciliated airway epithelial cells. Since rgRSV appears to breach the lumenal barriers encountered by other gene transfer vectors in the airway, this virus may be a good candidate for the development of a gene transfer vector for CF lung disease.","Zhang, Liqun; Peeples, Mark E; Boucher, Richard C; Collins, Peter L; Pickles, Raymond J",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11991994/,8

From November 1999 to May 2001, 259 specimens from 53 calves (< or = 6 months old), 27 young adults (52 years), 125 adults (> or = 2 years), and 54 animals of unknown age were examined by an antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay developed to detect BoTV. Testing for other enteric pathogens was performed by ADDL, and the results were analyzed with the BoTV data. The BoTV was detected using ELISA or RT-PCR in 9.7% (25/259) of the clinical samples, 56% (14/25) of which were from calves (P < 0.001) representing 26.4% (14/53) of the calves tested. Of the BoTV-positive calves, 71% (10/14) were less than 3 weeks of age. In 11/25 positive specimens, BoTV was the only pathogen detected among those examined. Other enteric organisms detected alone or in combination with BoTV in calf samples were rotavirus, coronavirus, Salmonella spp., Cryptosporidium spp., and Giardia spp.; but no consistent association between BoTV and these organisms was observed. In summary, BoTV was detected in fecal samples from cattle with diarrhea, principally in young calves less than 3 weeks of age. Future studies of infectious diarrhea in cattle should also include assays for this etiologic agent.","Hoet, Armando E; Nielsen, Paul R; Hasoksuz, Mustafa; Thomas, Christopher; Wittum, Thomas E; Saif, Linda J","Journal of veterinary diagnostic investigation : official publication of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians, Inc",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12735342/,8

The goal of the present study was to investigate the variability and the genotypic diversity of clinical strains circulating in the community. Since most reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays available cannot differentiate HRV from other members of the family Picornaviridae, we also validated an assay specific for HRV detection. The 5' noncoding regions of 87 different HRV serotypes and clinical isolates were sequenced. On the basis of sequence analysis and phylogenetic determination, we first confirmed that all clinical isolates were HRV. We then validated a real-time RT-PCR assay that was able not only to detect all HRV serotypes and all clinical isolates tested but also to accurately discriminate between rhinovirus and other viruses from the family Picornaviridae. This assay was negative with isolates of coxsackievirus (types A and B), echovirus, enterovirus, parechovirus, and poliovirus, as well as nonpicornaviruses. Among a series of bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, 4% (7 of 161) were positive by culture, whereas 13% (21 of 161) were positive by RT-PCR. In the present study we showed that to specifically identify HRV in clinical specimens, diagnostic assays need to overcome both the diversities and the similarities of picornaviruses. By sequencing the 5' noncoding regions of rhinoviruses recovered from clinical specimens, we designed probes that could specifically detect rhinovirus.","Deffernez, Christelle; Wunderli, Werner; Thomas, Yves; Yerly, Sabine; Perrin, Luc; Kaiser, Laurent",Journal of clinical microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15243084/,8

Furthermore, recent analysis of a variety of noncoding RNAs, such as microRNAs, has demonstrated that these RNAs play an important role in many cellular events, including cell differentiation and death, and may also serve as biological markers for disease. Besides helping in the understanding of diseases, RNA analysis is used in drug discovery, patient prognosis and treatment evaluation. One obstacle left to overcome is the amount of material required for the analysis, particularly when trying to extract information from precious, limited, clinical samples. Here we review the many approaches scientists take to either amplify the amount of RNA or amplify the signal generated from small amounts of RNA.","Mora, Johanna R; Getts, Robert C",Expert review of molecular diagnostics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18020907/,8

The authors argue that the combination of new methodology that enables the efficient production of genetically-modified (GM) animals with exciting new tools to alter gene activity makes the applications of transgenic animals for the benefit of animal (and human health) increasingly likely. This is illustrated through descriptions of specific examples. This technology is likely to have specific application where genetic variation does not exist in a given population or species and where novel genetic improvements can be engineered. These engineered animals would provide valuable models with which to investigate disease progression and evaluate this approach to controlling the disease. The authors propose that the use of GM animals will complement the more traditional tactics to combat disease, and will provide novel intervention strategies that are not possible through the established approaches.","Whitelaw, C B A; Sang, H M",Revue scientifique et technique,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16110895/,8

The SARS-CoV genome encodes the characteristic essential CoV replication and structural proteins. Additionally, the genome contains six group-specific open reading frames (ORFs) larger than 50 amino acids, with no known homologues. As with the group-specific genes of the other CoVs, little is known about the SARS-CoV group-specific genes. SARS-CoV ORF7a encodes a putative unique 122-amino-acid protein, designated U122 in this study. The deduced sequence contains a probable cleaved signal sequence and a C-terminal transmembrane helix, indicating that U122 is likely to be a type I membrane protein. The C-terminal tail also contains a typical endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retrieval motif, KRKTE. U122 was expressed in SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells, as it could be detected by Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses. U122 is localized to the perinuclear region of both SARS-CoV-infected and transfected cells and colocalized with ER and intermediate compartment markers.

The aim of the current preliminary study was to assess the psychometric properties of its Greek translation. MATERIALS AND METHODS 121 healthy volunteers 27.22 +/- 10.61 years old, and 22 depressed patients 29.48 +/- 9.28 years old entered the study. In 20 of them the instrument was re-applied 1-2 days later. Translation and Back Translation was made. The clinical diagnosis was reached with the SCAN v.2.0 and the IPDE. The Symptoms Rating Scale for Depression and Anxiety (SRSDA) and the EPQ were applied for cross-validation purposes. The Statistical Analysis included the Pearson Correlation Coefficient and the calculation of Cronbach's alpha. RESULTS The State score for healthy subjects was 34.30 +/- 10.79 and the Trait score was 36.07 +/- 10.47. The respected scores for the depressed patients were 56.22 +/- 8.86 and 53.83 +/- 10.87. Both State and Trait scores followed the normal distribution in control subjects. Cronbach's alpha was 0.93 for the State and 0.92 for the Trait subscale. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient between State and Trait subscales was 0.79. Both subscales correlated fairly with the anxiety subscale of the SRSDA. Test-retest reliability was excellent, with Pearson coefficient being between 0.75 and 0.98 for individual items and equal to 0.96 for State and 0.98 for Trait.

METHODOLOGY The technique-standardization (n = 8) and main study (n = 3) groups were formed from 11 pigs. A single-stitch telescopic anastomosis with a self-disposable internal stent was performed in the main study group. The animals were sacrificed at the end of the 4-week follow-up period, and cholangiograms and tissue samples were obtained. Repeated biological, hematological, and biochemical data were recorded. RESULTS No bilomas or functional biliary strictures were identified in any of the main study group animals. Light microscopy revealed intestinal metaplasia of the biliary epithelium in the portion of the bile duct telescoped inside the intestinal lumen. CONCLUSIONS Telescopic bilioenterostomy with a single pull-through stitch and a self-disposable stent is quick and reproducible in animal models, and it appears to be free of complications. Further experiments with longer follow-up periods are required to confirm that this anastomotic technique does not lead to episodes of delayed cholangitis or development of adenocarcinoma.","Vrochides, Dionisios; Ntinas, Achilleas; Kardassis, Dimitrios; Miliaras, Dimosthenis; Metrakos, Peter; Papalois, Apostolos",Journal of investigative surgery : the official journal of the Academy of Surgical Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23020272/,8

RESULTS In patients who underwent a combined method of rehabilitation, we observed progress in the development of their ability to improve motor skills. We identified various categories of parameters that can be evaluated by artificial intelligence methods, and we also identified that the key elements in the use of virtual reality as a rehabilitation method are the so-called ""WOW"" effect and the creation of an emotional change in the patient that motivates him to rehabilitate. CONCLUSION We have shown that virtual reality methods have the potential to accelerate rehabilitation and increase the motivation of selected groups of patients after stroke.",,Neuro endocrinology letters,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33201645/,8
197313,Real-time magnetic resonance imaging guidance improves the diagnostic yield of endomyocardial biopsy.,2016,"OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness and the frequency of use of a pulsed xenon ultraviolet light-emitting no-touch portable device (PX-UV), applied after perform current cleaning, in reducing environmental bacterial burden and the presence of pathogens on surfaces in the operating rooms at the Policlinico University Hospital of Foggia. DESIGN Prospective before-and-after study with a follow up duration of four months, from May to August 2019. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS Two operating rooms of an Orthopaedic and a Neurosurgical ward in a 780-bed university hospital in the District of Foggia, Italy (about 600,000 inhabitants). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES According to the hygienic standards proposed by the Italian Workers Compensation Authority (ISPESL), the total and the average bacterial load and the presence of six pathogens were evaluated between pre- and post- PX-UV use combined with routine manual cleaning. RESULTS The PX-UV system was applied at five distinct time points: t1: start of the experiment, t2: after 28 days, t3: after 13 days, t4: after 7 days, and t5: after 8 days (t2-t5: 28 days in total). About 16-min of PX-UV cycle showed significant reduction in the level of environmental contamination by decreasing the mean colony count by 87.5%, compliant with the standard (5< X ≤15 CFU per plat). Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii that had been isolated in some of the samplings before PX-UV were no longer detected after t1, t2 and t5 treatments. Before PX-UV, the mean colony count was similar between t1 and t2 (p>0.05); after t3 and t4 treatments, it was lower before t5 in both the Orthopaedic and Neurosurgical operating rooms (= -97% and -75%, respectively; p<0,01). CONCLUSIONS Implication for practice: PX-UV could supplement the standard cleaning process in reducing the microbial burden in the operating rooms and potentially achieving lower healthcare-associated surgical site infections rates.","Martinelli, D; Villone, G; Fortunato, F; Fiorino, G; Laurieri, N; Prato, R; Dattoli, V",Igiene e sanita pubblica,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33883751/,8

Triterpenoid is one of the mainly active components of licorice. In recent years, the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of many triterpenoids in licorice was confirmed, and these findings have become a hot spot of antiviral immunity. The triterpenoids of licorice has the potential to become a novel broad-spectrum antiviral medicine and will be widely used in the clinical treatment. This review provided a summary of the recent anti-virus research progress on several triterpenoids in licorice, such as glycyrrhizic acid, glycyrrhizin, glycyrrhetinic acid and its derivatives. The antiviral roles of triterpenoids in licorice against herpes virus, HIV, hepatitis virus, SARS coronavirus and influenza virus were briefly summarized.","Pu, Jie-Ying; He, Li; Wu, Si-Yu; Zhang, Ping; Huang, Xi",Bing du xue bao = Chinese journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24520776/,8
197984,Environment and carriage of hepatitis B antigen in leprosy.,1974,"Whereas considerable attention has been devoted to achieving high levels of influenza immunization, the importance of this issue is magnified by concern over pandemic influenza. Most recommendations for vaccine administration address high risk groups such as the elderly and those with chronic diseases, but coverage for hard-to-reach (HTR) populations has had less attention. HTR populations include minorities but also include other primarily urban groups such as undocumented immigrants, substance users, the homeless, and homebound elderly. Obstacles to the provision of immunization to HTR populations are present at the patient, provider, and structural levels. Strategies at the individual level for increasing immunization coverage include community-based educational campaigns to improve attitudes and increase motivation for receiving vaccine; at the provider level, education of providers to encourage immunizations, improving patient-provider interactions, broadening the provider base to include additional nurses and pharmacists, and adoption of standing orders for immunization administration; and at the structural level, promoting wider availability of and access to vaccine. The planning process for an influenza pandemic should include community engagement and extension of strategies beyond traditional providers to involve community-based organizations addressing HTR populations.","Vlahov, David; Coady, Micaela H; Ompad, Danielle C; Galea, Sandro",Journal of urban health : bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17562184/,8
198113,Evaluation of Pipeline Flex delivery system for the treatment of unruptured aneurysms.,2016,"Coronavirus genomes are the largest known autonomously replicating RNAs with a size of ca. 30 kb. They are of positive polarity and are translated to produce the viral proteins needed for the assembly of an active replicase-transcriptase complex. In addition to replicating the genomic RNA, a key feature of this complex is a unique transcription process that results in the synthesis of a nested set of six to eight subgenomic mRNAs. These subgenomic mRNAs are produced in constant but nonequimolar amounts and, in general, each is translated to produce a single protein. To take advantage of these features, we have developed a multigene expression vector based on human coronavirus 229E. We have constructed a prototype RNA vector containing the 5' and 3' ends of the human coronavirus genome, the entire human coronavirus replicase gene, and three reporter genes (i.e., the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase [CAT] gene, the firefly luciferase [LUC] gene, and the green fluorescent protein [GFP] gene). Each reporter gene is located downstream of a human coronavirus transcription-associated sequence, which is required for the synthesis of individual subgenomic mRNAs. The transfection of vector RNA and human coronavirus nucleocapsid protein mRNA into BHK-21 cells resulted in the expression of the CAT, LUC, and GFP reporter proteins. Sequence analysis confirmed the synthesis of coronavirus-specific mRNAs encoding CAT, LUC, and GFP. In addition, we have shown that human coronavirus-based vector RNA can be packaged into virus-like particles that, in turn, can be used to transduce immature and mature human dendritic cells. In summary, we describe a new class of eukaryotic, multigene expression vectors that are based on the human coronavirus 229E and have the ability to transduce human dendritic cells.","Thiel, Volker; Karl, Nadja; Schelle, Barbara; Disterer, Petra; Klagge, Ingo; Siddell, Stuart G",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12941887/,8
198158,Association between injections and HIV incidence.,2005,"Here we investigated ribosomal pausing at sites of programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting, using translational elongation and ribosome heelprint assays. The site of pausing at the frameshift signal of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was determined and was consistent with an RNA pseudoknot-induced pause that placed the ribosomal P- and A-sites over the slippery sequence. Similarly, pausing at the simian retrovirus 1 gag/pol signal, which contains a different kind of frameshifter pseudoknot, also placed the ribosome over the slippery sequence, supporting a role for pausing in frameshifting. However, a simple correlation between pausing and frameshifting was lacking. Firstly, a stem-loop structure closely related to the IBV pseudoknot, although unable to stimulate efficient frameshifting, paused ribosomes to a similar extent and at the same place on the mRNA as a parental pseudoknot. Secondly, an identical pausing pattern was induced by two pseudoknots differing only by a single loop 2 nucleotide yet with different functionalities in frameshifting. The final observation arose from an assessment of the impact of reading phase on pausing. Given that ribosomes advance in triplet fashion, we tested whether the reading frame in which ribosomes encounter an RNA structure (the reading phase) would influence pausing. We found that the reading phase did influence pausing but unexpectedly, the mRNA with the pseudoknot in the phase which gave the least pausing was found to promote frameshifting more efficiently than the other variants. Overall, these experiments support the view that pausing alone is insufficient to mediate frameshifting and additional events are required. The phase dependence of pausing may be indicative of an activity in the ribosome that requires an optimal contact with mRNA secondary structures for efficient unwinding.","Kontos, H; Napthine, S; Brierley, I",Molecular and cellular biology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11713298/,8
198345,uPAR-targeted multimodal tracer for pre- and intraoperative imaging in cancer surgery.,2015,"SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The spectrum of asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 transmission presents challenges for evaluating SARS-CoV-2 test performance for diagnostic or screening purposes and for interpreting test results. Molecular and antigen tests can detect current SARS-CoV-2 infection and are used to diagnose COVID-19. Clinicians should consider a test's characteristics, test timing in relation to symptom onset, and the pretest probability of disease when interpreting results. Molecular and antigen SARS-CoV-2 tests both have high specificity. However, antigen tests generally have lower sensitivity and thus greater potential for false-negative results. Pretest probability of disease should be based on a patient's exposure to someone with a confirmed or probable case, signs or symptoms of COVID-19, local or population-specific COVID-19 prevalence, and presence of an alternative diagnosis. Using a leaf plot is an efficient way to visualize posttest probability of disease based on estimated pretest probability and the test's sensitivity and specificity. A negative molecular or antigen test result might not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection when pretest probability is high, depending on the test's sensitivity. A symptom-based approach is preferred over a test-based approach for discontinuing isolation precautions for most patients with COVID-19 because prolonged shedding of viral RNA does not necessarily correlate with infectivity. Antibody tests might help identify past SARS-CoV-2 infection if performed two to four weeks after symptom onset; however, because of uncertainty about the extent and durability of postinfection or vaccine-induced immunity, they should not yet be used to infer immunity or guide discontinuation of personal protective measures.","Nettleton, William D",American family physician,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33856162/,8

200287,Immune response in COVID-19: What do we currently know?,2020,"OBJECTIVE Viruses are common pathogens of acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRTI) in children. There are few studies on consecutive monitoring of viral pathogens of ALRTI in a larger cohort during the past several years. The aim of this study was to investigate the viral pathogens of ALRTI in children of different age groups and to outline the epidemic feature of different viruses. METHOD (1) Totally 1914 (1281 male and 709 female) children with clinical diagnosis of ALRTI during the period of March 2007 to March 2010 were recruited into this study. These patients were hospitalized patients in department of internal medicine or outpatients in emergency department in Beijing Children's Hospital. The patients were divided into four groups, including 1072 patients < 1 year old, 326 patients 1- < 3 years old, 158 patients 3- < 6 years old, 358 patients ≥ 6 years old. One nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen was collected from each patient. Reverse transcription (RT) PCR methods were applied to detect common respiratory viruses including respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human rhinovirus (HRV), influenza virus type A, B and C (IFA, IFB, IFC), parainfluenza virus (PIV) type 1-4, adenovirus (ADV), enterovirus (EV), human coronavirus (HCOV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV) and human bocavirus (HBOV). RESULT (1) The total positive rate of viruses was 70.3%. The positive rate was 83.0% (890/1072) in the group of < 1 year old, and 80.1% (261/326) in group of 1- < 3 years old, 60.8% (96/158) in group of 3- < 6 years old and 27.7% (99/358) in group of ≥ 6 years old, respectively. There was a significant difference in the positive rate among different age groups (χ² = 2213.5, P = 0.000). The top three viruses were RSV, HRV and PIV; and the positive rates were 50.9%, 36.2% and 12.0% respectively in group of < 1 year old. (2) The epidemic seasons of RSV and HRV were winter and spring, and PIV infection was epidemic in spring and summer. (3) The detection rates of 2 or more viruses were 38.2%, 36.4%, 30.2% and 15.2% in groups of < 1 year old, 1- < 3 years old, 3- < 6 years old and ≥ 6 years old, respectively. There was a significant difference in the mixed infection rate among different age groups (χ² = 1346.00, P = 0.000). CONCLUSION RSV, HRV and PIV were the most predominant pathogens in younger children with ALRTI. Different viral infections had different seasonal features. Mixed infections with two or more viruses were detected in substantial proportion of patients with ALRTI, but further studies are needed to explore the clinical significance of mixed infection with viruses in patients with ALRTI.","Xie, Zheng-de; Xiao, Yan; Liu, Chun-yan; Hu, Ying-hui; Yao, Yuan; Yang, Yan; Qian, Su-yun; Geng, Rong; Wang, Jian-wei; Shen, Kun-ling",Zhonghua er ke za zhi = Chinese journal of pediatrics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22321179/,8
200355,Breathless,2021,"Photonic crystals (PCs) are periodic dielectric structures that have a band-gap that forbids propagation of a certain range of wavelengths of light. This property enables control of light with remarkable facility by modification of the band-gaps and produce effects that are impossible with conventional optics. Using chemically functionalized PCs, where the chemical functional group consists of amine and carboxyl group, in conjunction with a biomolecular probe material, the detection of pathogens and viral disease is possible, indicated by the shift in wavelength signal. Moreover, this system using the bioinspired PCs allows specific target detection in biosensor chip fields through control of the PCs. In this study, we demonstrated that two bacterial pathogens (Fusobacterium necrophorum and Acinetobacter baumannii) causing sepsis were detected by DNA-probe hybridization and a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus was detected by antigen-antibody interaction using the functional PCs. Optical readout with the integrated sensor detecting the signals from PCs, allows for low cost and robust readout of resonance peak shift. This biosensor system using the functional PCs on the photonic crystal-fabricated chip can efficiently and effectively detect various targets, and be easily prepared with high productivity and economic property.","Park, Tae Jung; Lee, Seung-Kon; Yoo, Seung Min; Yang, Seung-Man; Lee, Sang Yup",Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21446513/,8
200917,Anti-nuclear Antibody Testing in Children: How Much Is It Really Necessary?,2021,"The nucleotide sequence determination of the genome of the Beaudette strain of the coronavirus avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) has been completed. The complete sequence has been obtained from 17 overlapping cDNA clones, the 5'-most of which contains the leader sequence (as determined by direct sequencing of the genome) and the 3'-most of which contains the poly(A) tail. Approximately 8 kilobases at the 3' end of this sequence have already been published. These contain the sequences of mRNAs A to E within which are the genes for the spike, the membrane and the nucleocapsid polypeptides: the main structural components of the virion. The remainder of the sequence, equivalent to the 'unique' region of mRNA F, is some 20 kilobases in length and is thought to code for a polymerase or polymerases which are involved in the replication of the genome and the production of the subgenomic messenger RNAs. This sequence contains two large open reading frames, potentially coding for polypeptides of molecular weights 441,000 and 300,000. Unlike other large open reading frames in the virus, the 300,000 open reading frame appears to have no subgenomic RNA associated with it which would allow it to be at the 5' end of an mRNA species. Because of this, and because of the characteristics of the sequence in the region immediately upstream of its start codon, other mechanisms of translation, such as ribosome slippage, must be postulated.","Boursnell, M E; Brown, T D; Foulds, I J; Green, P F; Tomley, F M; Binns, M M",The Journal of general virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3027249/,8

METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, 932 hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan were enrolled, including 52 severe and 880 non-severe cases. All patients were followed up for 3 months after discharge. The symptomatic features and follow-up data of the patients in both groups were analyzed and compared. RESULTS: Of the 932 patients, fever (60.0%), cough (50.8%) and fatigue (36.4%) were the most common symptoms. In total, 32.7% of the severe cases presented with gastrointestinal symptoms at disease onset, including anorexia, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, which was significantly higher than that of the non-severe group (P = 0.0015). The incidence of olfactory disturbance and dysgeusia was only 3.1% and 6.2%, respectively. After adjusting for age and sex, multivariate regression analysis showed that fever lasting for over 5 days (odds ratio [OR] 1.90, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00-3.62, P = 0.0498), anorexia at onset (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.26-5.40, P = 0.0096), and modified Medical Research Council level above grade 2 when dyspnea occurred (OR 14.19, 95% CI 7.01-28.71, P < 0.0001) were symptomatic risk factors for severe COVID-19. During the follow-up, cough (6.2%), dyspnea (7.2%), fatigue (1.8%), olfactory disturbance and dysgeusia (1.5%) were the significant remaining symptoms.

As the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, supply chains were disrupted and fear of infection impacted food shopping decisions, pushing consumers to seek local and safer options for procuring fresh produce. Direct marketing arose as a promising alternative for both consumers and producers. We undertook a study in Bengaluru, India, in order to understand what direct marketing activities have unfolded with the COVID-19 pandemic. Media reports highlighted the plight of farmers struggling to market their harvest during lockdown as well as the farm to fork initiatives and lockdown farmers markets that have been created as a response. We see this moment as an opportunity to develop Bengaluru's food system to be more sustainable, specifically through the City Region Food System framework. This study conducted online and telephone surveys with both consumers and producers in Bengaluru to explore the elements of supply and demand that have fostered and hindered direct marketing schemes. We found that consumers are interested in sourcing fruits and vegetables directly from farmers, but communication and logistics between consumers and producers are major hindrances. Although producers are diversifying their marketing strategies, they need to be implemented at economically viable scales to ensure long-term success. We find that the role of technology, specifically messaging apps, can streamline direct marketing activities and remove the barriers that currently hamper rural-urban linkages. Furthermore, existing community and farmer organizations have the size and scale to make direct marketing schemes a worthy endeavor for both consumers and producers.","Yousefian, N.; Devy, M.

217389,Ten Weeks to Crush the Curve,2020,"Online learning systems in developing countries such as Jordan face many challenges. Universities worldwide have dealt with obstacles in terms of continuing face-to-face education. An online learning system is an indispensable solution for all universities. However, students have not been adequately prepared to use online learning systems. This study examines the factors that impact the use of online learning systems by accounting students in Jordanian public universities. A model combining the critical factors from social capital theory (SCT), the theory of reasoned action (TRA), and the technology acceptance model (TAM) is proposed. Data obtained from 274 students through previously tested and validated questionnaires are used to test students' actual use of the online learning system and to determine the factors that positively or negatively impact the use of this system. As hypothesized, the results show that social trust influences the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of online learning. In addition, the perceived usefulness of the online learning system is positively affected by its perceived ease of use and subjective norms. This study finds three significant predictors of attitudes toward use decisions: subjective norms, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness. The results are valuable to accounting educators, accounting students, universities, and higher education institutions.","Alshurafat, Hashem; Al Shbail, Mohannad Obeid; Masadeh, Walid Muhammad; Dahmash, Firas; Al-Msiedeen, Jebreel Mohammad",Educ Inf Technol (Dordr),,8
217923,Pharmacokinetic Advantage of ASD Device Promote Drug Absorption through the Epicardium,2020,"Malaysia is currently facing an outbreak of COVID-19. We aim to present the first study in Malaysia to report the reproduction numbers and develop a mathematical model forecasting COVID-19 transmission by including isolation, quarantine, and movement control measures. We utilized a susceptible, exposed, infectious, and recovered (SEIR) model by incorporating isolation, quarantine, and movement control order (MCO) taken in Malaysia. The simulations were fitted into the Malaysian COVID-19 active case numbers, allowing approximation of parameters consisting of probability of transmission per contact (ß), average number of contacts per day per case (Î¶), and proportion of close-contact traced per day (q). The effective reproduction number (Rt) was also determined through this model. Our model calibration estimated that (ß), (Î¶), and (q) were 0.052, 25 persons, and 0.23, respectively. The (Rt) was estimated to be 1.68. MCO measures reduce the peak number of active COVID-19 cases by 99.1% and reduce (Î¶) from 25 (pre-MCO) to 7 (during MCO). The flattening of the epidemic curve was also observed with the implementation of these control measures. We conclude that isolation, quarantine, and MCO measures are essential to break the transmission of COVID-19 in Malaysia.","Gill, Balvinder Singh; Jayaraj, Vivek Jason; Singh, Sarbhan; Mohd Ghazali, Sumarni; Cheong, Yoon Ling; Md Iderus, Nuur Hafizah; Sundram, Bala Murali; Aris, Tahir Bin; Mohd Ibrahim, Hishamshah; Hong, Boon Hao; Labadin, Jane",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,8

Users spend more and more time on these platforms and create an active and passive digital footprint through their interaction with other subjects. These data have high research potential in many fields, because understanding people’s communication on social media is essential to understanding their attitudes, experiences and behaviours. Social media analysis is a relatively new subject. There is still a need to develop methods and tools for researchers to help solve typical problems associated with this area. A researcher will be able to focus on the subject of research entirely. This article describes the Social Media Analysis based on Hashtag Research (SMAHR) framework, which uses social network analysis methods to explore social media communication through a network of hashtags. The results show that social media analysis based on hashtags provides information applicable to theoretical research and practical strategic marketing and management applications.","Pilař, Ladislav Lucie Kvasničková Stanislavská Kvasnička Roman Bouda Petr Pitrová Jana",Applied Sciences,,8

Considering the grave consequences resulting from such health-related risk behavior, we carried out an online questionnaire study to identify personal characteristics that frame a motivational sketch of those who refuse to follow the pandemic-related preventive measures. Our results from a sample of N = 570 German participants already indicate obvious changes in relevant variables in the four-week investigation period during the pandemic's initial phase (25th March to 22nd April 2020). Above all, the willingness to take preventive measures decreased, as did the assessment of the pandemic's severity. The perceived own vulnerability also turned out to be clearly age-dependent and, overall, our sample showed a negative affectivity deviating distinctively from a reference sample. These and other findings allow for identification of sources for public health interventions that can help to increase compliance with required prevention behavior, and thus, counteract COVID-19.","Welter, Virginia Deborah Elaine; Welter, Naemi Georgina Eliane; Großschedl, Jörg",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,8

The aim of this study was to retrospectively examine the clinical outcome of patients receiving in-hospital high-dose bolus cholecalciferol. Patients with a positive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 and overt COVID-19, hospitalized from 15 March to 20 April 2020, were considered. Based on clinical characteristics, they were supplemented (or not) with 400,000 IU bolus oral cholecalciferol (200,000 IU administered in two consecutive days) and the composite outcome (transfer to intensive care unit; ICU and/or death) was recorded. Ninety-one patients (aged 74 ± 13 years) with COVID-19 were included in this retrospective study. Fifty (54.9%) patients presented with two or more comorbid diseases. Based on the decision of the referring physician, 36 (39.6%) patients were treated with vitamin D. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed a significant predictive power of the four variables: (a) low (<50 nmol/L) 25(OH) vitamin D levels, (b) current cigarette smoking, (c) elevated D-dimer levels (d) and the presence of comorbid diseases, to explain the decision to administer vitamin D (area under the curve = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.67-0.87, p < 0.0001). Over the follow-up period (14 ± 10 days), 27 (29.7%) patients were transferred to the ICU and 22 (24.2%) died (16 prior to ICU and six in ICU). Overall, 43 (47.3%) patients experienced the combined endpoint of transfer to ICU and/or death. Logistic regression analyses revealed that the comorbidity burden significantly modified the effect of vitamin D treatment on the study outcome, both in crude (p = 0.033) and propensity score-adjusted analyses (p = 0.039), so the positive effect of high-dose cholecalciferol on the combined endpoint was significantly amplified with increasing comorbidity burden. This hypothesis-generating study warrants the formal evaluation (i.e., clinical trial) of the potential benefit that cholecalciferol can offer in these comorbid COVID-19 patients.","Giannini, Sandro; Passeri, Giovanni; Tripepi, Giovanni; Sella, Stefania; Fusaro, Maria; Arcidiacono, Gaetano; Torres, Marco Onofrio; Michielin, Alberto; Prandini, Tancredi; Baffa, Valeria; Aghi, Andrea; Egan, Colin Gerard; Brigo, Martina; Zaninotto, Martina; Plebani, Mario; Vettor, Roberto; Fioretto, Paola; Rossini, Maurizio; Vignali, Alessandro; Fabris, Fabrizio; Bertoldo, Francesco",Nutrients,,8

We aimed to determine the seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in HCWs in Ireland. Two tertiary referral hospitals in Irish cities with diverging community incidence and seroprevalence were identified; COVID-19 had been diagnosed in 10.2% and 1.8% of staff respectively by the time of the study (October 2020). All staff of both hospitals (N = 9038) were invited to participate in an online questionnaire and blood sampling for SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing. Frequencies and percentages for positive SARS-CoV-2 antibody were calculated and adjusted relative risks (aRR) for participant characteristics were calculated using multivariable regression analysis. In total, 5788 HCWs participated (64% response rate). Seroprevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 was 15% and 4.1% in hospitals 1 and 2, respectively. Thirty-nine percent of infections were previously undiagnosed. Risk for seropositivity was higher for healthcare assistants (aRR 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.4-3.0), nurses (aRR: 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.2), daily exposure to patients with COVID-19 (aRR: 1.6, 95% CI 1.2-2.1), age 18-29 years (aRR: 1.4, 95% CI 1.1-1.9), living with other HCWs (aRR: 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5), Asian background (aRR: 1.3, 95% CI 1.0-1.6) and male sex (aRR: 1.2, 95% CI 1.0-1.4). The HCW seroprevalence was six times higher than community seroprevalence. Risk was higher for those with close patient contact. The proportion of undiagnosed infections call for robust infection control guidance, easy access to testing and consideration of screening in asymptomatic HCWs. With emerging evidence of reduction in transmission from vaccinated individuals, the authors strongly endorse rapid vaccination of all HCWs.","Allen, Niamh; Riain, Una Ni; Conlon, Niall; Ferenczi, Annamaria; Carrion Martin, Antonio Isidro; Domegan, Lisa; Walsh, Cathal; Doherty, Lorraine; O039,; Farrelly, Cliona; Higgins, Eibhlin; Kerr, Colm; McGrath, Jonathan; Fleming, Catherine; Bergin, Colm",Epidemiol Infect,,8

Quantitative real-time PCR and CRISPR-based methods rapidly detect DNA/RNA in 1 h but suffer from inter-site variability. Absolute quantification of DNA/RNA by methods such as digital PCR reduce this variability but are currently too slow for wider application. Here, we report a RApid DIgital Crispr Approach (RADICA) for absolute quantification of nucleic acids in 40-60 min. Using SARS-CoV-2 as a proof-of-concept target, RADICA allows for absolute quantification with a linear dynamic range of 0.6-2027 copies/µL (R2 value > 0.99), high accuracy and low variability, no cross-reactivity to similar targets, and high tolerance to human background DNA. RADICA's versatility is validated against other targets such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) from human B cells and patients' serum. RADICA can accurately detect and absolutely quantify EBV DNA with similar dynamic range of 0.5-2100 copies/µL (R2 value > 0.98) in 1 h without thermal cycling, providing a 4-fold faster alternative to digital PCR-based detection. RADICA therefore enables rapid and sensitive absolute quantification of nucleic acids which can be widely applied across clinical, research, and biomanufacturing areas.","Wu, Xiaolin; Tay, Joshua K; Goh, Chuan Keng; Chan, Cheryl; Lee, Yie Hou; Springs, Stacy L; Wang, De Yun; Loh, Kwok Seng; Lu, Timothy K; Yu, Hanry",Biomaterials,,8

Quantitative and qualitive statistical analysis were carried out after laboratory detection.The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 was 33.02% in 12,400 suspected patients' specimens in Wuhan at the first months of COVID-19 epidemics. SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR test of nasopharyngeal swabs might produce 4.79% (594/12400) presumptive results. The positive rate of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was significantly different between gender, age, type of specimen, source of patients, respectively (P < .05).

SARS-CoV-2, the viral agent, is recognized by some endosomal and cytosolic receptors following cell entry, entailing innate and adaptive immunity stimulation, notably through interferon induction. Impairment in immunity activation in some patients, mostly elderlies, leads to high mortalities; thus, promoting immune responses may help. BCG vaccine is under investigation to prevent COVID-19 due to its non-specific effects on the immune system. However, other complementary immune-induction methods at early stages of the disease may be needed. Here, the potentially preventive immunologic effects of BCG and influenza vaccination are compared with the immune response defects caused by aging and COVID-19. BCG co-administration with interferon-&#945;/-ß, or influenza vaccine is suggested to overcome its shortcomings in interferon signaling against COVID-19. However, further studies are highly recommended to assess the outcomes of such interventions considering their probable adverse effects especially augmented innate immune responses and overproduction of proinflammatory mediators.","Mosaddeghi, Pouria; Shahabinezhad, Farbod; Dorvash, Mohammadreza; Goodarzi, Mojtaba; Negahdaripour, Manica",Hum Vaccin Immunother,,8

In the general setting, we prove well-posedness and positivity of the initial value problem for the system of state equations and the existence of solutions to the optimal control problem of the coefficients of the nonlinear part of the system, under a very general cost functional. We also prove the uniqueness of the optimal solution for a small time horizon when the cost is superlinear in all control variables with possibly different exponents in the interval (1,2].

It is the construction of economic integration in East Asia, which will promote regional economic integration and world economic development. It can be expected that the following 15 countries will soon release relevant supporting policies, such as visa free, landing visa and supporting tourism, catering and other consumer preferences, which will also make it more convenient and affordable for individuals to travel abroad. Now is a good time to experience foreign culture. Personal planning starts with the three categories of world cultural heritage advocated by UNESCO. The choice of conditions should start with the accommodation service of characteristic B & B around the tourism area, so as to be able to experience the foreign characteristics, festival atmosphere and learn the characteristics of multi culture.Because Covid-19 is still under continuous influence. Large group transnational travel groups have been temporarily frozen or disappeared. A new state of small bourgeois groups, short-term, and deep tourism has emerged. Expensive hotels have also reduced their prices to survive the epidemic. However, in order to avoid cluster infection, people who want to micro travel have changed to stay in low-cost and characteristic B & B, which are close to the scenic spots and cheap in price The main consideration of accommodation is that B & B has the characteristics of local characteristics to attract free travelers and backpackers to stay.The existing website and software of characteristic B & B are relatively simple and easy. Most websites can provide information services of passenger reservation and online payment. The construction of characteristic B & B online management system is the performance requirement of modular management system. According to the software engineering development process, find out the system requirements, feasibility system analysis, conceive system design, mainly including the front-end HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The server is Apache, the framework is Django, and the integrated compiler tool is PyCharm. Using Python language to separate the front-end and back-end of the system, combining Django framework with MySQL database technology can improve the stability of system performance, run system test, acceptance test and system security, and successfully construct the characteristic B & B management system. © 2021 ACM.","Huang, M.","4th International Conference on Computers in Management and Business, ICCMB 2021",,8

Meeting the challenges of delivering high standard breast care nursing services during the COVID pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Although contact precaution is generally recommended in situations where coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is suspected, there is limited evidence on environmental contamination of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Therefore, we conducted environmental surveillance on SARS-CoV-2 contamination in 2 different healthcare settings. METHODS: Viral contamination was investigated on the environment of 2 hospitals that had admitted 13 COVID-19 patients. In hospital A, 5 patients with pneumonia occupied negative pressure rooms. In hospital B, 8 asymptomatic patients shared 2 common 4-bed rooms. Most rooms were poorly cleaned or disinfected. Environmental swab were collected from inside and outside the rooms and were tested using real-time RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: In hospital A, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 10 of 57 (17.5%) samples from inside the rooms including the Ambu bag and infusion pump. Two samples obtained at more than 2 m from the patients showed positive results. In hospital B, 3 of 22 (13.6%) samples from inside the rooms were positive. Areas outside the rooms, such as the anteroom, corridor, and nursing station, were all negative in both hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital surfaces surrounding patients were contaminated by SARS-CoV-2. Our findings support the value of strict contact precaution, routine cleaning, and disinfection in the management of COVID-19 patients.","Ryu, Byung-Han; Cho, Younghwa; Cho, Oh-Hyun; Hong, Sun In; Kim, Sunjoo; Lee, Seungjun",Am J Infect Control,,8

Territory and energy are proposed as such basic resources. The analysis of isolated societies of Tasmania, the Chatham Islands, and North Sentinel Island concludes that habitat can exist long and sustainably in a local area of at least 30 square kilometres in a mode of inherent safety, without the use of artificial technologies. This conclusion demonstrates the possibility of sustainable development of human civilization as a sum of local communities in the context of the isolationism paradigm, an alternative to globalism’s currently dominant concept. The significance of identifying the least resource base of sustainable development of isolated communities in the context of the establishment of scientific bases and settlements in remote areas of the globe, on the Moon and other planets of the solar system, and developing strategies to combat pandemics such as COVID-19, is highlighted. © 2021, Russian Geographical Society.

METHODS: Six cases of severe or critically severe COVID-19 patients treated in The First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University from January 22 to February 4, 2020 were recruited, and all of them received artificial liver support treatment. Statistical analysis was carried out on the change of cytokines (TNF-&#945;, IL-10, IL-6, IFN-Î³, IL-2, IL-4), inflammation-related indicators (white blood cell, neutrophil, lymphocyte, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin), immune-related indicators (B lymphocyte percentage, natural killer cell percentage, CD3+CD4+CD8 T cell percentage), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in the 6 patients before and after treatment, and the proportions of patients with abnormal indicators were analyzed as well. In addition, computed tomography (CT) was used to observe the absorption of pulmonary lesions before and after the artificial liver support treatment. RESULTS: The levels of cytokines (IL-6 and IL-10) were effectively reduced in the 6 patients after treatment with the artificial liver support system. Meanwhile, the proportions of patients with abnormal TNF-&#945;, IL-10, IL-6 and IFN-Î³ were all decreased (p < 0.05). The levels of inflammation-related indicators including white blood cell, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin, and the proportions of patients with these abnormal indicators were both significantly reduced (p < 0.05). The level of neutrophil was not effectively reduced before and after the treatment, but the proportion was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). However, the abnormality of lymphocyte in the patients was not improved. There was no significant difference in immune-related indicators, AST and ALT before and after the treatment (p > 0.05). CT imaging showed that the artificial liver support treatment contributed to absorption of pulmonary lesions. CONCLUSIONS: The artificial liver support system had a great clinical effect in the treatment of cytokine storm and inflammation in COVID-19 patients, and it could promote the absorption of infected lesions.","Xia, Qi; Xu, Kaijin; Yu, Liang; Zhang, Huafen; Li, Lanjuan",Int Immunopharmacol,,8

METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive literature search for newborns diagnosed with COVID-19 using PubMed, LILACS and Google scholar until May 15, 2020, looking for published articles with pregnancy, vertical transmission, intrauterine transmission, neonates, delivery. RESULTS: There were found 10 articles with a total of 15 newborn infected with SARS-CoV-2 according to positive PCR at birth or in the first days of birth. Eleven newborn birth by cesarean section and 4 vaginally. Of the 11 cases with cesarean section, two presented premature rupture of the membranes. Seven newborns developed pneumonia, of which two had ruptured membranes and one was born by vaginal delivery. CONCLUSION: This review shows that there is perinatal or neonatal infection with SARS-CoV-2 by finding a positive PCR in the first days of birth. In addition, that there is more possibility of neonatal infection if the birth is vaginal or if there is premature rupture of the membranes before cesarean section. Vaginal delivery and premature rupture of membranes should be considered as risk factors for perinatal infection.","Vigil-De Gracia, Paulino; Luo, Carlos; Epifanio Malpassi, Roberto",J Matern Fetal Neonatal Med,,8

We aimed to analyze the association of Crs with outcome in COVID-19-associated ARDS, to ascertain its determinants and to describe its evolution at day-14. METHODS: In this observational multicenter cohort of patients with moderate to severe Covid-19 ARDS, Crs was measured at day-1 and day-14. Association between Crs or Crs/ideal body weight (IBW) and breathing without assistance at day-28 was analyzed with multivariable logistic regression. Determinants were ascertained by multivariable linear regression. Day-14 Crs was compared to day-1 Crs with paired t-test in patients still under controlled mechanical ventilation. RESULTS: The mean Crs in 372 patients was 37.6 ± 13 mL/cmH2O, similar to as in ARDS of other causes. Multivariate linear regression identified chronic hypertension, low PaO2/FiO2 ratio, low PEEP, and low tidal volume as associated with lower Crs/IBW. After adjustment on confounders, nor Crs [OR 1.0 (CI 95% 0.98-1.02)] neither Crs/IBW [OR 0.63 (CI 95% 0.13-3.1)] were associated with the chance of breathing without assistance at day-28 whereas plateau pressure was [OR 0.93 (CI 95% 0.88-0.99)]. In a subset of 108 patients, day-14 Crs decreased compared to day-1 Crs (31.2 ± 14.4 mL/cmH2O vs 37.8 ± 11.4 mL/cmH2O, p < 0.001). The decrease in Crs was not associated with day-28 outcome. CONCLUSION: In a large multicenter cohort of moderate to severe COVID-19 ARDS, mean Crs was decreased below 40 mL/cmH2O and was not associated with day-28 outcome. Crs decreased between day-1 and day-14 but the decrease was not associated with day-28 outcome.","Vandenbunder, Benoit; Ehrmann, Stephan; Piagnerelli, Michael; Sauneuf, Bertrand; Serck, Nicolas; Soumagne, Thibaud; Textoris, Julien; Vinsonneau, Christophe; Aissaoui, Nadia; Blonz, Gauthier; Carbutti, Giuseppe; Courcelle, Romain; D039,; hondt, Alain; Gaudry, Stephane; Higny, Julien; Horlait, Geoffroy; Hraiech, Sami; Lefebvre, Laurent; Lejeune, Francois; Ly, Andre; Lascarrou, Jean-Baptiste; Grimaldi, David",Crit Care,,8

When evaluated specifically for pain, the data so far have shown that myalgia, headache, and chest pain can be seen in patients at varying rates; myalgia and headache, especially, are among the initial symptoms. DESIGN: This retrospective chart review, followed by a descriptive survey design study, was carried out by examining patients afflicted with COVID-19. After discharge, patients were asked about the severity and the body region of their pain, their use of analgesics, their mood and mental health, and their overall quality of life. RESULTS: A total of 206 patients with a mean age of 56.24 ± 16.99 yrs were included in the study. Pain during COVID-19 was found to be higher compared with the preinfectious and postinfectious states. The most frequent painful areas were reported to be the neck and back before the infection, whereas the head and limbs during the infection. The most frequently used analgesic during infection was paracetamol. There was no relationship between the patients' pain and anxiety and depression; the quality of life was found to be worse in patients with persistent pain. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the head and limbs were the most common painful body regions during COVID-19. It was also found that pain can continue in the postinfection period.","Sahin, Tülay; Ayyildiz, Aylin; Gencer-Atalay, Kardelen; Akgün, Cem; Özdemir, Haci Mustafa; Kuran, Banu",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,,8

Their outstanding academic credentials notwithstanding, a quarter of this cohort has historically struggled to adapt to the PBL-focused MD curriculum with a deficiency of contextual learning, over reliance on superficial learning strategies, inexperience in problem-solving and lack of teamwork skills identified as contributing factors. This underpinned the rationale for the design and development of a capstone course Integrative Medical Sciences in 2016, to address these concerns and facilitate pre-medicine students? transition to open-enquiry PBL in medical school. This study evaluated the impact of the capstone experience, including when it was delivered online due to Covid-19, in facilitating this transition. Methods Utilizing case-based learning (CBL), this capstone employs clinical cases focused on pharmacology as the ?linking discipline? to integrate and apply knowledge acquired through courses in anatomy, physiology, biochemistry and pathophysiology to understand the concepts of fundamental sciences that underpin disease. After four iterations of the capstone having been taught in small-group face-to-face settings, Covid-19 forced the abrupt transition to online delivery of live lectures, small-group CBL sessions, case-wrap sessions and assessments. Student evaluations of the course (SEC) were conducted at the end of the capstone, and longitudinal surveys of first- and second-year medical students assessed the impact of the capstone experience on their transition from pre-medicine to the MD program. Results SEC data for the past five years (50%-66% response rate) showed that the pharmacology-focussed capstone was extraordinarily effective;with a mean overall satisfaction score of 4.80/5.00 ± 0.09. The overall effectiveness of the transition to online delivery in 2020 was scored by students as outstanding (74.4%), good (19.2%) or satisfactory (6.4%) (n = 78;100% response rate), with individual ratings being outstanding or good for online lectures (98.8%), CBL (93.6%), Case-wrap sessions (96.2%) and assessments (98.7%) (Figure 1). Most students (82%) encountered no problems with online learning, while 10% encountered some technical difficulties. Students perceptions of the effectiveness of the capstone delivered online or face-to-face (in 2018 and 2019) revealed both approaches to be equally effective (Figure 2). Additionally, first-year medical students rated the overall impact of the pre-medicine capstone on their transition to PBL in the MD program as significantly positive (96%) or somewhat positive (4%) (n = 51;64% response rate);whereas second-year medical students rated this as significantly positive (96%), somewhat positive (2%) or negligible (2%)(n = 43;63% response rate). Conclusions A pharmacology-focussed capstone course delivered utilizing small-group CBL in the pre-medicine degree was perceived by students to be very helpful in transitioning to open-enquiry PBL in graduate medical school. The online delivery of the capstone necessitated by Covid-19, was found to be as effective as when it was delivered face-to-face.","Nirthanan, Selvanayagam",The FASEB Journal,,8

This is exemplified by a set of iconic and well-characterized monoclonal antibodies developed after the 2003 SARS outbreak, including mAbs m396, CR3022, CR3014 and 80R, which potently neutralize SARS-CoV-1, but not SARS-CoV-2. Here, we explore antibody engineering strategies to change and broaden their specificity, enabling nanomolar binding and potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2. Intriguingly, while many of the matured clones maintained specificity of the parental antibody, new specificities were also observed, which was further confirmed by X-ray crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy, indicating that a limited set of VH antibody domains can give rise to variants targeting diverse epitopes, when paired with a diverse VL repertoire. Our findings open up over 15 years of antibody development efforts against SARS-CoV-1 to the SARS-CoV-2 field and outline general principles for the maturation of antibody specificity against emerging viruses.","Rouet, Romain; Mazigi, Ohan; Walker, Gregory J; Langley, David B; Sobti, Meghna; Schofield, Peter; Lenthall, Helen; Jackson, Jennifer; Ubiparipovic, Stephanie; Henry, Jake Y; Abayasingam, Arunasingam; Burnett, Deborah; Kelleher, Anthony; Brink, Robert; Bull, Rowena A; Turville, Stuart; Stewart, Alastair G; Goodnow, Christopher C; Rawlinson, William D; Christ, Daniel",MAbs,,8

256664,Epigenetic Regulation of Cancer Stem Cell formation and maintenance,2020,"Clinical observations indicate that COVID-19 often provokes coagulopathies, which have been associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. These coagulopathies likely result from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection-elicited systemic inflammation and endothelial damage. Patients with severe COVID-19 are at high risk of venous and arterial thromboembolic diseases;they can also develop disseminated intravascular coagulation in the most advanced stages of the disease. Medical Organisations on Thrombosis and Hemostasis, among which the Belgian Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (BSTH), have formulated recommendations for the prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19-related venous thromboembolism in ambulatory and hospitalised patients, as well as for the anticoagulation of COVID-19 patients in need of long-term anticoagulation for unrelated cause.These recommendations provide every hospital and primary care physicians with an easy-to-use clinical guidance;they mainly rely on limited level of evidence and are likely to evolve with knowledge of COVID- 19 pathophysiology and availability of data from ongoing clinical trials.","Péters, P.; Sprynger, M.; Lancellotti, P.; Oury, C.",Revue Medicale de Liege,,8

Is it time for a revival?,2021,"COVID-19 is a respiratory infection that has been declared as a global health crisis by the WHO. It mainly affects the respiratory system. Apart from respiratory system, it also affects other organs as well including the brain. Numerous emerging reports have demonstrated that the COVID-19 has detrimental effects on neurological functions, and can lead to severe impairment of the nervous system. The neurological manifestations linked with COVID-19 include headache, anosmia, encephalitis, epileptic seizures, Guillain-Barre syndrome, stroke and intracerebral hemorrhage alongwith multiple others complications. The CNS related complications may be severe are they are linked with poor diagnosis which may worsen the condition. Therefore, there is a need to precisely understand the neurological sequelae along with upcoming clinical outcomes. Here, we presented a brief review of neurological complications and symptoms associated with COVID-19 along with brain imaging findings. Further, we have discussed about the emerging biosensing approaches which may aid in rapid, precise and mass diagnosis of COVID-19.","Singh, Vishakha Allawadhi Prince Khurana Amit Banothu Anil Kumar Bharani Kala Kumar",Sensors International,,8

In addition, some recommended personal protective equipment (PPE) is not compatible with commonly used ENT equipment. This study aims to investigate the degree of eye protection that commonly used PPE gives. Study Design: Simulation model. Setting: Simulation laboratory. Methods: A custom-built setup was utilized to simulate the clinical scenario of a patient cough in proximity of a health care worker. A system that sprays a xanthan-fluorescein mixture was set up and calibrated to simulate a human cough. A mannequin with cellulose paper placed on its forehead, eyes, and mouth was fitted with various PPE combinations and exposed to the simulated cough. The degree of contamination on the cellulose papers was quantified with a fluorescent microscope able to detect aerosols &gt;=10 microm. Results: When no eye protection was worn, 278 droplets/aerosols reached the eye area. The use of the surgical mask with an attached upward-facing shield alone resulted in only 2 droplets/aerosols reaching the eye area. In this experiment, safety glasses and goggles performed equally, as the addition of either brought the number of droplets/aerosols reaching the eye down to 0. Conclusion: When used with an upward-facing face shield, there was no difference in the eye protection rendered by safety goggles or glasses in this study. Safety glasses may be considered a viable alternative to safety goggles in aerosol-generating procedures.","Ng, J. H.; Daniel, D.; Sadovoy, A.; Teo, C. E.

The S protein is a key virulence factor determining viral pathogenesis, host tropism, and disease pathogenesis. There are currently diverse corona viruses that are known to cause disease in humans. The occurrence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), as fatal human CoV diseases, has induced significant interest in the medical field. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a novel strain of coronavirus (SAR-CoV-2). The SARSCoV2 outbreak has been evolved in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, and identified as a pandemic on March 2020 resulting in 53.24 M cases and 1.20M deaths worldwide. SARS-CoV-2 main proteinase (MPro), a key protease of CoV-2, mediates viral replication and transcription. SARS-CoV-2 MPro has been emerged as an attractive target for SARS-CoV-2 drug design and development. Diverse scaffolds have been released targeting SARS-CoV-2 MPro. In this review, we culminate the latest published information about SARS-CoV-2 main proteinase (MPro) and reported inhibitors.","Sabbah, Dima A; Hajjo, Rima; Bardaweel, Sanaa K; Zhong, Haizhen A",Curr. top. med. chem,,8

The First Affiliated Hospital of Chengdu Medical College has adopted telestroke to make stroke care accessible in remote areas. During the period January 2020 to March 2020, there was no COVID-19 case reported in our stroke center. A significant reduction of stroke admission was observed between the ischemic stroke group (235 vs. 588 cases) and the intracerebral hemorrhage group (136 vs. 150 cases) when compared with the same period last year (p < 0.001). The mean door-to-needle time (DNT) and door-to-puncture time (DPT) was 62 and 124 min, respectively. Compared to the same period last year, a significant change was observed in DNT (62 ± 12 vs. 47 ± 8 min, p = 0.019) but not in DPT (124 ± 58 vs. 135 ± 23 min, p = 0.682). A total of 46 telestroke consultations were received from network hospitals. Telestroke management in the central hospital was performed on 17 patients. Of them, 3 (17.6%) patients had brain hernia and died in hospital and 8 (47.1%) patients were able to ambulation at discharge and had a modified Rankin Scale of 0-2 at 3 months. The COVID-19 pandemic impacted stroke care significantly in our hospital, including prehospital and in-hospital settings, resulting in a significant drop in acute ischemic stroke admissions and a delay in DNT. The construction of a telestroke network enabled us to extend health-care resources and make stroke care accessible in remote areas.

264946,Strategic issues currently facing the US blood system,2020,"Background: The annual seasonal influenza epidemics in the winter season lead to many hospital admissions, increasing risks of nosocomial infections. Infectious diseases caused by contagious respiratory pathogens also pose a great risk to hospitals as has been seen in the current epidemic by a novel coronavirus infection. Such risk occurs in high density patient settings with few or no partitions, since the pathogens are transmitted by aerosols discharged from the patients. Possible interventions against the transmission are needed. Methods: We developed a compact, lightweight, and portable hood designed to cover just the top half of a patient sitting or lying in bed, to limit the dissemination of infectious aerosols, constructed out of lightweight pipes, transparent plastic curtains, and a fan-filter-unit (FFU). The containment efficacy of the product was tested using an aerosolized cultured influenza virus tracer and an optimal airflow rate was determined according to the test results. It was tested for use in hospital wards during the 2016-2018 influenza seasons. Results: The hood, named as Barrihood®, had dimensions height 172 cm, width 97 cm, length 38 cm, weighed 26 kg, and easily strolled and unfolded from its stored to its fully operational state of length 125 cm within a few minutes by a single operator. Optimal operational airflow-rate of the FFU was 420 L/min for containment of the aerosol particles. Eighty-one uninfected patients remained for 176 cumulative person-days within 1-4 m of influenza-infected patients isolated within the hood, without acquiring influenza infection. Conclusions: With the use of the hood, secondary influenza infection cases significantly decreased, compared to previous influenza seasons. It may be suited to hospitals with not enough/no negative pressure facilities, or without enough number of individual patient isolation rooms, and could contribute to decrease the risk of nosocomial infections.","Nishimura, Hidekazu; Sakata, Soichiro",J Thorac Dis,,8

Overexpression of the carboxyl terminus (CT) of the cognate channel Kv2.2 is neuroprotective by disrupting Kv2.1 surface clusters. Here, we define a seven-amino acid declustering domain within Kv2.2 CT (DP-2) and demonstrate its neuroprotective efficacy in a murine ischemia-reperfusion model. TAT-DP-2, a membrane-permeable derivative, induces Kv2.1 surface cluster dispersal, prevents post-injurious pro-apoptotic potassium current enhancement, and is neuroprotective in vitro by disrupting the association of Kv2.1 with VAPA. TAT-DP-2 also induces Kv2.1 cluster dispersal in vivo in mice, reducing infarct size and improving long-term neurological function following stroke. We suggest that TAT-DP-2 induces Kv2.1 declustering by disrupting Kv2.1-VAPA association and scaffolding sites required for the membrane insertion of Kv2.1 channels following injury. We present the first evidence of targeted disruption of Kv2.1-VAPA association as a neuroprotective strategy following brain ischemia.","Schulien, Anthony J; Yeh, Chung-Yang; Orange, Bailey N; Pav, Olivia J; Hopkins, Madelynn P; Moutal, Aubin; Khanna, Rajesh; Sun, Dandan; Justice, Jason A; Aizenman, Elias",Sci.

Existential–humanistic therapy often is neglected with trauma and disaster relief work, despite its relevancy and important contributions. All therapies must adjust in crisis situations, particularly when adjustments to how services are offered are disrupted; however, the impact of these changes varies by therapeutic orientation. As an approach that values genuineness, empathy, and presence, existential–humanistic therapy faces unique challenges when employed with disaster response. However, when these challenges are faced, existential–humanistic therapy has much to offer disaster response, including consideration of existential guilt, existential shattering, existential anxiety, and existential perspectives on self-care.","Hoffman, Louis",J.

Attendance at addiction specialist prescribers may be limited, particularly in rural areas. Telemedicine, such as videoconferencing, can reduce travel and improve access and attendance. Pre-COVID-19, we started a telemedicine service for patients with opioid dependence, prescribed opioid substitution treatment, requiring addiction specialist prescriber consultations. We present patient experience and assess whether patients recommend telemedicine.MethodHealth Research Authority approval for Randomized Controlled Trial of Telemedicine versus Face-to-Face (control) appointments in large semi-rural community addictions service (2500km2) using a modified Hub-and-Spoke (outreach). Adult opioid dependent patients prescribed OST and attending outreach clinics recruited. Participants received two consultations in group. Telemedicine delivered using Skype-for-business videoconferencing. Patients attended outreach clinic, where an outreach worker undertook drug testing and telemedicine conducted via the outreach workers laptop. Specialist addiction prescribers located remotely, at the Hub. Patients self-completed NHS Friends and Family Test (FFT) immediately after appointment, separate from the wider research study. Data collected Sept 2019– March 2020 (pre-COVID-19 lockdown), Microsoft Excel analysis, with qualitative thematic free-text analysis.ResultThirty completed FFTs were received, of which all participants were ‘extremely likely’ (n = 19;67%) or ‘likely’ (n = 11;37%) to recommend the Telemedicine service to friends or family, if they needed similar care. Two themes for reasons for recommending the service were;1. Convenience (reduced travel, reduced travel time and reduced travel costs) and 2. Supportive Staff (including listening, caring and good support). One patient mentioned ‘it is a convenient way to communicate with medical staff, saving time and effort’. Regarding Telemedicine appointments, most participants responded that the timing of telemedicine appointments was good (n = 26;87%), given enough information (n = 30;100%), enough privacy (n = 28;93%), enough time to talk (n = 30;100%), involved as much as they wanted (n = 25;83%), given advice on keeping well (n = 28;93%), and NHS staff were friendly and helpful (n = 29;97%). No participants thought they were treated unfairly. When asked what went well, patient themes were: 1. Everything and 2. Communication (including listening and explaining). One patient stated ‘Everything better, telemedicing good, heard it well, everything improved this year’. In terms of what the service could do better, there were no issues identified.ConclusionThe Telemedicine in Addictions service was overwhelmingly highly recommended by patients. Patients recommended the service because of convenience and supportive staff. The use of telemedicine is acceptable to patients and could be considered more widely.

Methods: We included 85 endoscopic procedures performed at Lahore General Hospital from May to July 2020. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) were implemented for patient selection, risk stratification and personal protective equipment (PPE) use for endoscopy staff. Patient and endoscopy staff were followed for Covid-19 infection. PPE scores for staff and Covid-19 positivity on follow-up were correlated using student’s t test. Results: Following 85 procedures included, 2 (2.3%) patients became Covid-19 positive. PPE score was &lt;9 in 5 (5.8%) procedures for endoscopist and Covid-19 developed in 2 (2.3%) of them, PPE score was &lt;9 during 19 (22.3%) procedures in 1st assistant and 9 (10.5%) developed infection and for 2nd assistant PPE score was &lt;9 in 19(22.3%) endoscopies and 5 (5.9%) tested positive for covid-19. Infectivity of endoscopy staff was 6.2%. Association between PPE score and risk of Covid-19 was not significant. (p value 0.51 for endoscopist, 0.10 for 1st assistant and 0.09 for 2nd assistant). Conclusion: Compliance of SOPs for infection control reduces risk of acquiring Covid-19 infection during endoscopy.

This study is motivated by the increasing demand for handsanitizers which has had an impact on price ratings. The method used is an explanatory survey with an exponential form approach for the demand function and Linear Cobweb Form for the supply function. The structure of the hand sanitizer market is assumed to be a perfectly competitive market. The results of the study indicate that despite changes in prices, the numerical analysis shows that prices are stable. The entry and exit of companies in the market does not affect price stability. This finding implies that after the pandemic the prices of handsanitizers will return to normal, so producers and consumers must remain rational.","Machmud, Amir; Minghat, Asnul Dahar Bin",Indonesian Journal Of Science And Technology,,8
275457,Antimicrobial Stewardship: Fighting Antimicrobial Resistance and Protecting Global Public Health,2020,"Periodontitis has been associated with low-grade inflammation as assessed by C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and its treatment can decrease CRP serum levels. The aim of this systematic review was to critically appraise the evidence comparing CRP serum levels (standard and high-sensitivity [hs]) of otherwise healthy patients suffering from periodontitis when compared to controls. The impact of intensive and non-intensive nonsurgical periodontal treatment (NSPT) on hs-CRP was also investigated. Four electronic databases (Pubmed, The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL], EMBASE and Web of Science) were searched up to February 2021 and the review was completed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines (PROSPERO No. CRD42020167454). Observational and intervention studies that: 1) evaluated CRP and hs-CRP serum levels in patients with and without periodontitis, and; 2) hs- CRP levels after NSPT were included. Following risk of bias appraisal, both qualitative and quantitative analyses were performed. Pooled estimates were rendered through ratio of means (RoM) random-effects meta-analyses. After screening 485 studies, 77 case-control studies and 67 intervention trials were included. Chronic and aggressive periodontitis diagnoses were consistently associated with higher levels of CRP and hs-CRP (p<0.001). Patients with aggressive periodontitis exhibited on average more than 50% higher levels of CRP (RoM [95% confidence interval [CI]]: 1.56 [1.15; 2.12], p=0.0039) than patients with chronic periodontitis. Intensive NSPT induced an immediate increase of hs-CRP followed by a progressive decrease whilst non-intensive NSPT consistently decreased hs-CRP after treatment up to 180 days (p<0.001). These findings provide robust evidence that periodontitis is associated with systemic inflammation as measured by serum CRP levels. Periodontitis treatment induces a short-term acute inflammatory increase when performed in an intensive session, whilst a progressive reduction up to 6 months was demonstrated when performed in multiple visits.","Machado, Vanessa; Botelho, João; Escalda, Cláudia; Hussain, Syed Basit; Luthra, Shailly; Mascarenhas, Paulo; Orlandi, Marco; Mendes, José João; D039,; Aiuto, Francesco",Front Immunol,,8

277973,Biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and the Application of Precision Medicine,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV2) outbreak is the most dramatic event since World War II. Originating as a cluster of unexplained cases of pneumonia, it turned out that this viral disease termed COVID-19 is not only a respiratory infection, but a systemic disease associated with a number of extrapulmonary complications. One of the medical disciplines that is strongly affected by this viral infection is gastroenterology. COVID-19 causes in some patients typical symptoms of enteritis such as diarrhea or abdominal pain. There is also evidence that this infection may lead to liver and pancreatic injury. Since the SARS-CoV2 virus was detected in stool, a fecal-oral route of transmission is possible. Moreover, viral receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is highly expressed in the gastrointestinal tract and enables the invasion of the gastrointestinal epithelium as demonstrated in vitro and in vivo. COVID-19 pandemic has an impact on the daily practice and the workflows in endoscopy leading to a dramatic decrease of screening and surveillance procedures. COVID-19 impacts the therapy of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), particularly those using high doses of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive agents and biologics. Patients with preexisting liver disease, especially metabolic associated liver fatty disease (MALFD) with fibrosis or liver cirrhosis, are at high risk for severe COVID-19. As long as no active vaccine against SARS-CoV2 is available, gastroenterologists have to be aware of these problems that affect their daily routine practice.","Konturek, P C; Harsch, I A; Neurath, M F; Zopf, Y",J. physiol. pharmacol,,8

280569,What's New at Muscle & Nerve?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Delays in diagnosis and treatment have been reported for many cancers, with resultant stage migration and worse survival; however, few data exist in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). These data are of particular importance in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused disruptions in healthcare processes and may continue to impact cancer care for the foreseeable future. The aim of our study was to characterize the prevalence and clinical significance of diagnostic and treatment delays in patients with HCC. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients diagnosed with HCC between January 2008 and July 2017 at 2 US health systems. Diagnostic and treatment delays were defined as >90 days between presentation and HCC diagnosis and between diagnosis and treatment, respectively. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with diagnostic and treatment delays and Cox proportional hazard models to identify correlates of overall survival. RESULTS: Of 925 patients with HCC, 39.0% were diagnosed via screening, 33.1% incidentally, and 27.9% symptomatically. Median time from presentation to diagnosis was 37 days (interquartile range, 18-94 days), with 120 patients (13.0%) experiencing diagnostic delays. Median time from HCC diagnosis to treatment was 46 days (interquartile range, 29-74 days), with 17.2% of patients experiencing treatment delays. Most (72.5%) diagnostic delays were related to provider-level factors (eg, monitoring indeterminate nodules), whereas nearly half (46.2%) of treatment delays were related to patient-related factors (eg, missed appointments). In multivariable analyses, treatment delays were not associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.60-1.35); these results were consistent across subgroup analyses by Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage and treatment modality. CONCLUSIONS: Diagnostic and therapeutic delays exceeding 3 months are common in patients with HCC; however, observed treatment delays do not seem to significantly impact overall survival.","Rao, Ashwin; Rich, Nicole E; Marrero, Jorge A; Yopp, Adam C; Singal, Amit G",J Natl Compr Canc Netw,,8

They were admitted to the third people’s Hospital of Shenzhen from January 16 to February 6, 2020. The distribution and morphology of pulmonary lesions on chest CT images were analyzed.@*Results@#Among the 15 children, there were 5 males and 10 females, aged from 4 to 14 years old. Five of the 15 children were febrile and 10 were asymptomatic on first visit. The first nasal or pharyngeal swab samples in all the 15 cases were positive for 2019-nCoV nucleic acid. For their first chest CT images, 6 patients had no lesions, while 9 patients had pulmonary inflammation lesions. Seven cases of small nodular ground glass opacities and 2 cases of speckled ground glass opacities were found. After 3 to 5 days of treatment, 2019-nCoV nucleic acid in a second respiratory sample turned negative in 6 cases. Among them, chest CT images showed less lesions in 2 cases, no lesion in 3 cases, and no improvement in 1 case. Other 9 cases were still positive in a second nucleic acid test. Six patients showed similar chest CT inflammation, while 3 patients had new lesions, which were all small nodular ground glass opacities.@*Conclusions@#The early chest CT images of children with 2019-nCoV infection are mostly small nodular ground glass opacities. The clinical symptoms of children with 2019-nCoV infection are nonspecific.

Ensuring a safe and reliable water supply and maintaining water sanitation has become ever more critical during the pandemic. For this reason, researchers and practitioners have promptly investigated the impact associated with the spread of SARS-CoV-2 on water treatment processes, focusing specifically on water disinfection. However, the COVID-19 pandemic impacts multiple aspects of the urban water sector besides those related to the engineering processes, including sanitary, economic, and social consequences which can have significant effects in the near future. Furthermore, this outbreak appears at a time when the water sector was already experiencing a fourth revolution, transitioning toward the digitalisation of the sector, which redefines the Water-Human-Data Nexus. In this contribution, a product of collaboration between academics and practitioners from water utilities, we delve into the multiple impacts that the pandemic is currently causing and their possible consequences in the future. We show how the digitalisation of the water sector can provide useful approaches and tools to help address the impact of the pandemic. We expect this discussion to contribute not only to current challenges, but also to the conceptualization of new projects and the broader task of ameliorating climate change.","Poch, Manel; Garrido-Baserba, Manel; Corominas, Lluís; Perelló-Moragues, Antoni; Monclús, Hector; Cermerón-Romero, Manuel; Melitas, Nikos; Jiang, Sunny C; Rosso, Diego",Sci Total Environ,,8
284199,Acceptability of Telegenetics for Families with Genetic Eye Diseases,2021,"Background: Inconsistent results have been observed regarding the independent effect of diabetes on the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We conducted a nationwide population-based cohort study to evaluate the relationship between diabetes and COVID-19 severity in South Korea. METHODS: Patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 aged &#8805;30 years were enrolled and medical claims data were obtained from the Korean Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service. Hospitalization, oxygen treatment, ventilator application, and mortality were assessed as severity outcomes. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. RESULTS: Of 5,307 COVID-19 patients, the mean age was 56.0±14.4 years, 2,043 (38.5%) were male, and 770 (14.5%) had diabetes. The number of patients who were hospitalized, who received oxygen, who required ventilator support, and who died was 4,986 (94.0%), 884 (16.7%), 121 (2.3%), and 211 (4.0%), respectively. The proportion of patients with diabetes in the abovementioned outcome groups was 14.7%, 28.1%, 41.3%, 44.6%, showing an increasing trend according to outcome severity. In multivariate analyses, diabetes was associated with worse outcomes, with an adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of 1.349 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.099 to 1.656; P=0.004) for oxygen treatment, an aOR of 1.930 (95% CI, 1.276 to 2.915; P<0.001) for ventilator use, and an aOR of 2.659 (95% CI, 1.896 to 3.729; P<0.001) for mortality. CONCLUSION: Diabetes was associated with worse clinical outcomes in Korean patients with COVID-19, independent of other comorbidities.

METHODS: We offered SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-PCR and antibody (Abbott ARCHITECT IgG) testing, regardless of symptoms, to all residents (&#8805;4 years) and workers in a San Francisco census tract (population: 5,174) at outdoor, community-mobilized events over four days. We estimated SARS-CoV-2 point prevalence (PCR-positive) and cumulative incidence (antibody or PCR-positive) in the census tract and evaluated risk factors for recent (PCR-positive/antibody-negative) versus prior infection (antibody-positive/PCR-negative). SARS-CoV-2 genome recovery and phylogenetics were used to measure viral strain diversity, establish viral lineages present, and estimate number of introductions. RESULTS: We tested 3,953 persons: 40% Latinx; 41% White; 9% Asian/Pacific Islander; and 2% Black. Overall, 2.1% (83/3,871) tested PCR-positive: 95% were Latinx and 52% asymptomatic when tested. 1.7% of census tract residents and 6.0% of workers (non-census tract residents) were PCR-positive. Among 2,598 tract residents, estimated point prevalence of PCR-positives was 2.3% (95%CI: 1.2-3.8%): 3.9% (95%CI: 2.0-6.4%) among Latinx vs. 0.2% (95%CI: 0.0-0.4%) among non-Latinx persons. Estimated cumulative incidence among residents was 6.1% (95%CI: 4.0-8.6%). Prior infections were 67% Latinx, 16% White, and 17% other ethnicities. Among recent infections, 96% were Latinx. Risk factors for recent infection were Latinx ethnicity, inability to shelter-in-place and maintain income, frontline service work, unemployment, and household income &$50,000/year. Five SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic lineages were detected.

Cyclic peptide (cRGD) and indocyanine green (ICG) were applied to the surface of RBCs to increase the targeting and photothermal effect, respectively. Doxorubicin (DOX) as a model drug was loaded into RBCs by the hypotonic dialysis method. A series of tests have been carried out to evaluate the RBCs-based DDS and these tasks include physicochemical properties, cellular uptake, targeting ability, and combination therapeutic efficiency. As a result, the DOX was successfully loaded into RBCs and the drug loading amount was 0.84â¯±â¯0.09â¯mg/mL. There was no significant change of particle size after surface modification of RBCs. The RBCs-based DDS could target to the surface of cancer cells, which delivery DOX to the lesions efficiently and accurately. Meanwhile, due to the combined treatment effect, the RBCs-based DDS can effectively inhibit tumor growth. The RBCs-based DDS constructed in this research may have promising applications in cancer therapy due to their highly synergistic efficient therapy and to investigate its possibility for tumor therapy.","Wang, Chen; Huang, Jingru; Zhang, Yan; Jia, Hongxin; Chen, Binbin",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,,8

In March 2019 the World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 was a pandemic. COVID-19 patients typically have a fever, dry cough, dyspnea, fatigue, and anosmia. Some patients also report gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, as well as liver enzyme abnormalities. Surprisingly, many studies have found severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral RNA in rectal swabs and stool specimens of asymptomatic COVID-19 patients. In addition, viral receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and transmembrane protease serine-type 2, were also found to be highly expressed in gastrointestinal epithelial cells of the intestinal mucosa. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 can dynamically infect and replicate in both GI and liver cells. Taken together these results indicate that the GI tract is a potential target of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the present review summarizes the vital information available to date on COVID-19 and its impact on GI aspects.","Sahu, Tarun; Mehta, Arundhati; Ratre, Yashwant Kumar; Jaiswal, Akriti; Vishvakarma, Naveen Kumar; Bhaskar, Lakkakula Venkata Kameswara Subrahmanya; Verma, Henu Kumar",World J Gastroenterol,,8

291765,Telephone,2020,"We use a stochastic branching process model, structured by age and level of healthcare access, to look at the heterogeneous spread of COVID-19 within a population. We examine the effect of control scenarios targeted at particular groups, such as school closures or social distancing by older people. Although we currently lack detailed empirical data about contact and infection rates between age groups and groups with different levels of healthcare access within New Zealand, these scenarios illustrate how such evidence could be used to inform specific interventions. We find that an increase in the transmission rates among children from reopening schools is unlikely to significantly increase the number of cases, unless this is accompanied by a change in adult behaviour. We also find that there is a risk of undetected outbreaks occurring in communities that have low access to healthcare and that are socially isolated from more privileged communities. The greater the degree of inequity and extent of social segregation, the longer it will take before any outbreaks are detected. A well-established evidence for health inequities, particularly in accessing primary healthcare and testing, indicates that Maori and Pacific peoples are at a higher risk of undetected outbreaks in Aotearoa New Zealand. This highlights the importance of ensuring that community needs for access to healthcare, including early proactive testing, rapid contact tracing and the ability to isolate, are being met equitably. Finally, these scenarios illustrate how information concerning contact and infection rates across different demographic groups may be useful in informing specific policy interventions.","James, A; Plank, M J; Binny, R N; Lustig, A; Hannah, K; Hendy, S C; Steyn, N",Math. med. biol,,8
291766,Telephone,2020,"Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated telehealth to deliver psychiatric services. Continuation of psychiatric services for individuals with high clinical acuity was critical. This study examined attendance to rapidly deployed telehealth services for psychiatrically high-risk individuals receiving intensive outpatient program (IOP), primarily group-based psychotherapy services for adults and adolescents by race/ethnicity, insurance, and clinical treatment program within a large hospital-based outpatient psychiatric setting. Methods: Chi-square tests compared whether attendance rates for telehealth versus in-person IOP services varied by population group, race, insurance, and clinical program, using observational data of adolescent and adult patients treated between October 1, 2019, and July 31, 2020. Results: Appointment attendance increased for telehealth versus in-person services for adolescents (&#967;2 (df = 1) = 27.49, p < 0.0001) and adults (&#967;2 (df = 1) = 434.37, p < 0.0001). For adults, increased appointment attendance for telehealth was observed across insurance type (Medicaid: +11.5%; Medicare: +13.79%; Commercial: +6.94%), race/ethnicity (+6.23% to +15.76% across groups), and for IOP groups across all five diagnostic treatment programs (between 7.59% and 15.9% increases across groups). Adolescent results were mixed; increased appointment attendance for telehealth was observed among commercially insured youth (+7.11%), but no differences were observed for Medicaid-insured youth. Non-Hispanic white youth had increased attendance for telehealth (+8.38%) and no differences were observed for non-Hispanic black youth. Decreases were found in telehealth attendance for Hispanic/Latinx youth (-13.49%). Discussion: Rapidly deployed telehealth increased attendance to intensive services for psychiatrically high-risk individuals, particularly among adults and for adolescents with commercial insurance and non-Hispanic white youth. Trends among racial/ethnic and Medicaid-insured youth warrant further investigation regarding the potential for special challenges or vulnerabilities and advocacy needs. Findings highlight telehealth as an important tool in supporting availability of services for individuals with high levels of psychiatric acuity, particularly for group-based services, during the pandemic.","Childs, Amber W; Bacon, Sandra M; Klingensmith, Katherine; Li, Luming; Unger, Adam; Wing, Angelina M; Fortunati, Frank",Telemed. j. e. health,,8
292453,Transforming ORs into ICUs,2020,"Human respiratory viral infections are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality around the world. Among the various respiratory viruses, coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV-2) have created the greatest challenge and most frightening health threat worldwide. Human coronaviruses typically infect the upper respiratory tract, causing illnesses that range from common cold-like symptoms to severe acute respiratory infections. Several promising vaccine formulations have become available since the beginning of 2021. Nevertheless, achievement of herd immunity is still far from being realized. Social distancing remains the only effective measure against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nanobiotechnology enables the design of nanobiosensors. These nanomedical diagnostic devices have opened new vistas for early detection of viral infections. The present review outlines recent research on the effectiveness of nanoplatforms as diagnostic and antiviral tools against coronaviruses. The biological properties of coronavirus and infected host organs are discussed. The challenges and limitations encountered in combating SARS-CoV-2 are highlighted. Potential nanodevices such as nanosensors, nanobased vaccines, and smart nanomedicines are subsequently presented for combating current and future mutated versions of coronaviruses.","Bidram, Elham; Esmaeili, Yasaman; Amini, Abbas; Sartorius, Rossella; Tay, Franklin R; Shariati, Laleh; Makvandi, Pooyan",ACS Biomater Sci Eng,,8

Resourcefulness can minimize the effect of stress on health outcomes. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between caregiving stress during the pandemic, resourcefulness, and self-rated health and assess the mediating effect of resourcefulness. A convenience sample of 70 family caregivers of adults with chronic and/or disabling conditions was recruited using social media groups and professional networking platforms. Data were collected using an online survey and analyzed using linear regression. Mediation analysis was conducted using the PROCESS macro. Higher levels of caregiving stress during the pandemic and lower levels of resourcefulness were associated with worse self-rated health, while controlling for age, employment status, and weekly caregiving hours. Resourcefulness mediated the relationship between caregiving stress and self-rated health. Our findings highlight the importance of assessing the psychological impact of the pandemic on family caregivers' outcomes. Resourcefulness skills can be targeted to improve the health and well-being of family caregivers during and beyond the pandemic.","Irani, Elliane; Niyomyart, Atsadaporn; Zauszniewski, Jaclene A",Issues Ment Health Nurs,,8

One is a fitting function that can be calibrated to reproduce an epidemic curve with two timescales (e.g., fast growth and slow decay). The other is a compartmental model that accounts for quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing, a non-exponentially distributed incubation period, asymptomatic individuals, and mild and severe forms of symptomatic disease. Using Bayesian inference, we have been calibrating our models daily for consistency with new reports of confirmed cases from the 15 most populous metropolitan statistical areas in the United States and quantifying uncertainty in parameter estimates and predictions of future case reports. This online learning approach allows for early identification of new trends despite considerable variability in case reporting.

296725,Letter to the Editor: Significant mutation enrichment in inverted repeat sites of new SARS-CoV-2 strains,2021,"Rapid diagnosis and isolation are key to containing the quick spread of a pandemic agent like severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which has spread globally since its initial outbreak in Wuhan province in China. SARS-CoV-2 is novel and the effect on typically prevalent seasonal viruses is just becoming apparent. We present our initial data on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in the month of March 2020. This is a retrospective cohort study post launching of SARS-CoV-2 testing at Baylor Scott and White Hospital (BSWH), Temple, Texas. Testing for SARS-CoV-2 was performed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction assay and results were shared with State public health officials for immediate interventions. More than 3500 tests were performed during the first 2 weeks of testing for SARS-CoV-2 and identified 168 (4.7%) positive patients. Sixty-two (3.2%) of the 1912 ambulatory patients and 106 (6.3%) of the 1659 emergency department/inpatients tested were positive. The highest rate of infection (6.9%) was seen in patients aged 25 to 34 years, while the lowest rate of infection was seen among patients aged <25 years old (2%). County-specific patient demographic information was shared with respective public health departments for epidemiological interventions. Incidentally, this study showed that there was a significant decrease in the occurrence of seasonal respiratory virus infections, perhaps due to increased epidemiological awareness about SARS-CoV-2 among the general public, as well as the social distancing measures implemented in response to SARS-CoV-2. Data extracted for BSWH from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System site revealed that Influenza incidence was 8.7% in March 2020, compared with 25% in March 2019. This study was intended to provide an initial experience of dealing with a pandemic and the role of laboratories in crisis management. This study provided SARS-CoV-2 testing data from ambulatory and inpatient population. Epidemiological interventions depend on timely availability of accurate diagnostic tests and throughput capacity of such systems during large outbreaks like SARS-CoV-2.","Mutnal, Manohar B; Arroliga, Alejandro C; Walker, Kimberly; Mohammad, Amin; Brigmon, Matthew M; Beaver, Ryan M; Midturi, John K; Rao, Arundhati",J. med. virol,,8

Our aim was to analyze the incidence of pediatric emergency department (ED) visits and hospitalizations for traumatic injuries during this period. METHODS: Any visit with an ICD-10 discharge diagnosis code of burn, fracture, traumatic wound, or sprain/bruise contusion was recorded within the 2 weeks before (weeks 10 and 11) and during the confinement (weeks 12 and 19). The visits with the same ICD-10 discharge diagnosis code during similar weeks of the previous 2 years were also included. For each of those visits, the number of hospitalizations was counted. RESULTS: The number of recorded visits between week 10 and 19 in 2018, 2019, and 2020 was, respectively, 2657, 2625, and 1106 children. The average number of visits per day during the confinement (13±5) was significantly different from the average number of visits per day during the same weeks in 2018 and 2019 (38±8 vs. 39±9, P<0.0001). The average number of visits per day was significantly lower during confinement compared with 2018/2019 for three categories of diagnoses (P<0.0001) but not for burns (1.7 vs. 1.8, P=0.23). The average number of hospitalizations per day was significantly lower during the confinement than during 2018/2019 (1.6±1.3 vs. 2.6±1.8, P<0.0001). CONCLUSION: Confining children in an urban setting appears to decrease the incidence of injuries, except for burns. These data may be useful in reorganizing caregiver supervision and hospital units.

301245,Role of Aging and the Immune Response to Respiratory Viral Infections: Potential Implications for COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: This study reports on the readiness of Palestinian dentists to reopen their practices for routine care during the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: A cross-sectional study targeted dentists in the West Bank area of Palestine using an online survey during the first 2 weeks of May 2020. Questions mainly asked about dentists' perception of the risks of COVID-19, readiness to reopen their clinics for routine care, and the level of confidence in dealing with patients suspected of having COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 488 dentists completed the survey. Almost 60% believed that they were not ready to reopen their practices. Almost 13% had ""no confidence"" in dealing with patients with COVID-19, while 64% had ""little to moderate"" confidence. Confidence was correlated negatively with increased fear of becoming infected (&#961;â¯=â¯-0.317, P < .0001) and positively with years of practice (&#961;â¯=â¯1.7, P < .0001). Dentists who received updated training on infection control or on COVID-19 reported higher levels of confidence (&#967;2â¯=â¯53.8, P < .0001, &#967;2â¯=â¯26.8, P < .0001, respectively). Although 88% preferred not to treat patients with COVID-19, 40% were willing to provide care to them. Almost 75% reported that they were already facing financial hardships and could not survive financially until the end of the current month. CONCLUSIONS: Ethical and financial reasons were the main drivers for dentists in this sample to reopen their practices for routine care. Data from this study highlights the fragility of private dental practice in emergency situations. Ethical, health, and financial challenges that emerged during COVID-19 require dentists to adapt and be better prepared to face future crises.","Kateeb, Elham T; Juniedi, Raed N; Warren, John J",Int. dent. j,,8

To gain insight into the high infection rate of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we compare the interaction between the human ACE2 receptor and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with that of other pathogenic coronaviruses using molecular dynamics simulations. SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and HCoV-NL63 recognize ACE2 as the natural receptor but present a distinct binding interface to ACE2 and a different network of residue-residue contacts. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have comparable binding affinities achieved by balancing energetics and dynamics. The SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 complex contains a higher number of contacts, a larger interface area, and decreased interface residue fluctuations relative to the SARS-CoV-ACE2 complex. These findings expose an exceptional evolutionary exploration exerted by coronaviruses toward host recognition.

One key element in viral infection is the process of viral entry into the host cells. In the last two decades, there is increasing understanding on the importance of the endocytic pathway and the autophagy process in viral entry and replication. As a result, the endocytic pathway including endosome and lysosome has become important targets for development of therapeutic strategies in combating diseases caused by CoVs. In this mini-review, we will focus on the importance of the endocytic pathway as well as the autophagy process in viral infection of several pathogenic CoVs inclusive of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the new CoV named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), and discuss the development of therapeutic agents by targeting these processes.

As such, the purpose of this study was to examine walking pattern variability by way of lower extremity coordination and spatio-temporal characteristics in children with autism compared with individuals with typical development during over-ground walking. METHODS: Bilateral continuous relative phase variability was computed for the thigh-leg, leg-foot, and thigh-foot segment couples for 11 children with autism and 9 children with typical development at each gait sub-phase. Furthermore, left and right stride lengths and stride width were computed and compared. The Model Statistic was utilized to test for statistical differences in variability between each child with autism to an aggregate group with typical development. Effect sizes were computed to determine the meaningfulness between responses for children with autism and typical development. Coefficient of variation and effect sizes were computed for stride lengths and stride width. FINDINGS: Analysis revealed that children with autism exhibited differences in variability in each gait sub-phase. Notably, all but two children with autism exhibited lesser variability in all segment couples during terminal swing. Differences in stride lengths were relatively minimal, however, greater coefficient of variation magnitudes in stride width were observed in children with autism. INTERPRETATION: This finding reveals that children with autism may have limited or a preferred movement strategy when preparing the foot for ground contact. The findings from this study suggest variability may be an identifiable characteristic during movement in children with autism.","Eggleston, Jeffrey D; Harry, John R; Cereceres, Patrick A; Olivas, Alyssa N; Chavez, Emily A; Boyle, Jason B; Dufek, Janet S","Clin Biomech (Bristol, Avon)",,8

303532,Imiquimod - A toll like receptor 7 agonist - Is an ideal option for management of COVID 19,2020,"We present a novel mathematical formalism to predict the kinetics of DNA damage repair after exposure to both low- and high-LET radiation (X rays; 350 MeV/n 40Ar; 600 MeV/n 56Fe). Our method is based on monitoring DNA damage repair protein 53BP1 that forms radiation-induced foci (RIF) at locations of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) in the nucleus and comparing its expression in primary skin fibroblasts isolated from 15 mice strains. We previously reported strong evidence for clustering of nearby DSB into single repair units as opposed to the classic ""contact-first"" model where DSB are considered immobile. Here we apply this clustering model to evaluate the number of remaining RIF over time. We also show that the newly introduced kinetic metrics can be used as surrogate biomarkers for in vivo radiation toxicity, with potential applications in radiotherapy and human space exploration. In particular, we observed an association between the characteristic time constant of RIF repair measured in vitro and survival levels of immune cells collected from irradiated mice. Moreover, the speed of DNA damage repair correlated not only with radiation-induced cellular survival in vivo, but also with spontaneous cancer incidence data collected from the Mouse Tumor Biology database, suggesting a relationship between the efficiency of DSB repair after irradiation and cancer risk.","Pariset, Eloise; Penninckx, Sébastien; Kerbaul, Charlotte Degorre; Guiet, Elodie; Macha, Alejandra Lopez; Cekanaviciute, Egle; Snijders, Antoine M; Mao, Jian-Hua; Paris, François; Costes, Sylvain V",Radiat. res,,8

New perspectives and insights are needed to guide GHPs when navigating current and future collaborations. This study aimed to understand perspectives and insights of international partners regarding how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted their GHPs with institutions in the United States. We performed a cross-sectional qualitative study conducted through virtual semi-structured interviews performed between June 12, 2020 and July 22, 2020. We queried academic institutions based in the United States to refer individuals from their corresponding international GHP organizations. We invited these individuals to participate in virtual interviews that were audio-recorded and transcribed. We analyzed data qualitatively to identify themes. Eighty-four United States partners provided e-mail addresses for international partners. Ten individuals from these GHPs completed the interview. Participants reported overall positive experiences with their United States-based partners during the pandemic. The following themes emerged: imbalanced decision-making; worry about partnership continuity; opportunity to optimize communication within partnerships; interest in incorporating technology to facilitate engagement; and a desire for increased bilateral exchanges. Several challenges appeared to exist before COVID-19 and were highlighted by the pandemic. Most respondents were optimistic regarding the future of their GHPs. However, concerns were expressed regarding the implications of fewer in-person international experiences with United States trainees and the desire for stronger communication. Although our results do not represent the perspectives and insights of all GHPs, they provide considerations for the future. We urge institutions in the United States to re-examine and strive for equitable relationships with their international partners.","McHenry, Megan S; Tam, Reena P; Nafiseh, Amira A; Etling, Mary Ann; Barnes, Adelaide E; Rule, Amy R L; Crouse, Heather L; Haq, Heather; Morris, Lee E; Murray, Brittany L; Umphrey, Lisa A; Keating, Elizabeth M",Am. j. trop. med. hyg,,8

Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 alters host cell metabolism may lead to potential treatments for COVID-19. Here we profile metabolic changes conferred by SARS-CoV-2 infection in kidney epithelial cells and lung air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures, and show that SARS-CoV-2 infection increases glucose carbon entry into the TCA cycle via increased pyruvate carboxylase expression. SARS-CoV-2 also reduces oxidative glutamine metabolism while maintaining reductive carboxylation. Consistent with these changes, SARS-CoV-2 infection increases the activity of mTORC1 in cell lines and lung ALI cultures. Lastly, we show evidence of mTORC1 activation in COVID-19 patient lung tissue, and that mTORC1 inhibitors reduce viral replication in kidney epithelial cells and lung ALI cultures. Our results suggest that targeting mTORC1 may be a feasible treatment strategy for COVID-19 patients, although further studies are required to determine the mechanism of inhibition and potential efficacy in patients.","Mullen, Peter J; Garcia, Gustavo; Purkayastha, Arunima; Matulionis, Nedas; Schmid, Ernst W; Momcilovic, Milica; Sen, Chandani; Langerman, Justin; Ramaiah, Arunachalam; Shackelford, David B; Damoiseaux, Robert; French, Samuel W; Plath, Kathrin; Gomperts, Brigitte N; Arumugaswami, Vaithilingaraja; Christofk, Heather R",Nat Commun,,8

309630,Plans and Pandemics,2020,"BACKGROUND: Studies have reminded that cardiovascular metabolic comorbidities made patients more susceptible to suffer 2019 novel corona virus (2019-nCoV) disease (COVID-19), and exacerbated the infection. The aim of this analysis is to determine the association of cardiovascular metabolic diseases with the development of COVID-19. METHODS: A meta-analysis of eligible studies that summarized the prevalence of cardiovascular metabolic diseases in COVID-19 and compared the incidences of the comorbidities in ICU/severe and non-ICU/severe patients was performed. Embase and PubMed were searched for relevant studies. RESULTS: A total of six studies with 1527 patients were included in this analysis. The proportions of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular disease and diabetes in patients with COVID-19 were 17.1%, 16.4% and 9.7%, respectively. The incidences of hypertension, cardia-cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes were about twofolds, threefolds and twofolds, respectively, higher in ICU/severe cases than in their non-ICU/severe counterparts. At least 8.0% patients with COVID-19 suffered the acute cardiac injury. The incidence of acute cardiac injury was about 13 folds higher in ICU/severe patients compared with the non-ICU/severe patients. CONCLUSION: Patients with previous cardiovascular metabolic diseases may face a greater risk of developing into the severe condition and the comorbidities can also greatly affect the prognosis of the COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 can, in turn, aggravate the damage to the heart.","Li, Bo; Yang, Jing; Zhao, Faming; Zhi, Lili; Wang, Xiqian; Liu, Lin; Bi, Zhaohui; Zhao, Yunhe",Clin Res Cardiol,,8

We compare the evolution (from January to May 2020) of the daily mobility flows in Italy, measured by means of nation-wide mobile phone data, and the evolution of transmissibility, measured by the net reproduction number, i.e., the mean number of secondary infections generated by one primary infector in the presence of control interventions and human behavioural adaptations. We find a striking relationship between the negative variation of mobility flows and the net reproduction number, in all Italian regions, between March 11th and March 18th, when the country entered the lockdown. This observation allows us to quantify the time needed to""switch off""the country mobility (one week) and the time required to bring the net reproduction number below 1 (one week). A reasonably simple regression model provides evidence that the net reproduction number is correlated with a region's incoming, outgoing and internal mobility. We also find a strong relationship between the number of days above the epidemic threshold before the mobility flows reduce significantly as an effect of lockdowns, and the total number of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections per 100k inhabitants, thus indirectly showing the effectiveness of the lockdown and the other non-pharmaceutical interventions in the containment of the contagion.

As pregnant women began to present for delivery while sick with COVID-19, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) convened a writing group in March 2020 to develop guidance for the management of their newborns. The initial guidance was developed emergently and was forced to rely on extremely limited data from China. The initial guidance advocated for a conservative approach that included temporary physical separation of infected mother and newborn. To address the knowledge deficit, the AAP sponsored a volunteer registry to collect data on perinatal infection and management. As data have emerged informing the natural history of COVID-19, the performance of PCR-based diagnostics, the value of infection control measures and the risk of infant disease, AAP has issued serial updates to newborn guidance. SUMMARY: Evolving knowledge on the epidemiology of perinatal COVID-19 has informed newborn guidance.

METHODS: A survey was distributed to 14 different hospitals of the Milan area to analyze the variation of EGS procedures. Each hospital reported the number of EGS procedures in the same time frame comparing 2019 and 2020. The survey revealed that the number of patients during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in 2020 was reduced by 19% when compared with 2019. The decrease was statistically significant only for abdominal wall surgery. Interestingly, in 2020, there was an increase of three procedures: surgical intervention for acute mesenteric ischemia (p = 0.002), drainage of perianal abscesses (p = 0.000285), and cholecystostomy for acute cholecystitis (p = 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: During the first COVID-19 pandemic wave in the metropolitan area of Milan, the number of patients operated for emergency diseases decreased by around 19%. We believe that this decrease is related either to the fear of the population to ask for emergency department (ED) consultation and to a shift towards a more non-operative management in the surgeons 'decision making' process. The increase of acute mesenteric ischaemia and perianal abscess might be related to the modification of dietary habits and reduction of physical activity related to the lockdown.","Kurihara, Hayato; Marrano, Enrico; Ceolin, Martina; Chiara, Osvaldo; Faccincani, Roberto; Bisagni, Pietro; Fattori, Luca; Zago, Mauro",Eur. j. trauma emerg. surg,,8
314921,Radiotherapy and immunotherapy combinations in the treatment of patients with metastatic disease: current status and future focus,2021,"OBJECTIVES: During the COVID-19 pandemic, stigmatization of older persons has increased in traditional and social media. It was unknown whether this negative messaging could be detrimental to the mental health of older individuals, and whether the relatively uncommon positive messaging about older individuals could benefit their mental health. METHOD: To address these gaps, we designed age-stereotype interventions based on actual news stories that appeared during the pandemic, and divided them into negative and positive versions of what we term personified (i.e., person-based) and enumerative (i.e., number-based) age-stereotype messaging. The negative versions of the two types of messaging reflected the age stereotype of decline whereas the positive versions of the two types of messaging reflected the age stereotype of resilience. RESULTS: As expected, the exposure of older individuals to the negative-age-stereotype-messaging interventions led to significantly worse mental health (more anxiety and less peacefulness), compared to a neutral condition; in contrast, the positive-age-stereotype-messaging interventions led to significantly better mental health (less anxiety and more peacefulness), compared to a neutral condition. The findings were equally strong for the personified and enumerative conditions. Also as expected, the interventions, which were self-irrelevant to the younger participants, did not significantly impact their mental health. DISCUSSION: This is the first-known study to experimentally demonstrate that institutional ageism, and statistics that reflect stereotypes about older individuals, can impact mental health. The results demonstrate the need for media messaging aimed at empowering older individuals during the pandemic and beyond.","Levy, Becca R; Chang, E-Shien; Lowe, Sarah; Provolo, Natalia; Slade, Martin D",,,8

We aimed to describe the characteristics and outcomes and to analyze the risk factors for in-hospital mortality of COVID-19 patients with diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This two-center retrospective study was performed at two tertiary hospitals in Wuhan, China. Confirmed COVID-19 patients with diabetes (N = 153) who were discharged or died from 1 January 2020 to 8 March 2020 were identified. One sex- and age-matched COVID-19 patient without diabetes was randomly selected for each patient with diabetes. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were abstracted. Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to identify the risk factors associated with the mortality in these patients. RESULTS: Of 1,561 COVID-19 patients, 153 (9.8%) had diabetes, with a median age of 64.0 (interquartile range 56.0-72.0) years. A higher proportion of intensive care unit admission (17.6% vs. 7.8%, P = 0.01) and more fatal cases (20.3% vs. 10.5%, P = 0.017) were identified in COVID-19 patients with diabetes than in the matched patients. Multivariable Cox regression analyses of these 306 patients showed that hypertension (hazard ratio [HR] 2.50, 95% CI 1.30-4.78), cardiovascular disease (HR 2.24, 95% CI 1.19-4.23), and chronic pulmonary disease (HR 2.51, 95% CI 1.07-5.90) were independently associated with in-hospital death. Diabetes (HR 1.58, 95% CI 0.84-2.99) was not statistically significantly associated with in-hospital death after adjustment. Among patients with diabetes, nonsurvivors were older (76.0 vs. 63.0 years), most were male (71.0% vs. 29.0%), and they were more likely to have underlying hypertension (83.9% vs. 50.0%) and cardiovascular disease (45.2% vs. 14.8%) (all P values <0.05). Age &#8805;70 years (HR 2.39, 95% CI 1.03-5.56) and hypertension (HR 3.10, 95% CI 1.14-8.44) were independent risk factors for in-hospital death of patients with diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients with diabetes had worse outcomes compared with the sex- and age-matched patients without diabetes. Older age and comorbid hypertension independently contributed to in-hospital death of patients with diabetes.","Shi, Qiao; Zhang, Xiaoyi; Jiang, Fang; Zhang, Xuanzhe; Hu, Ning; Bimu, Chibu; Feng, Jiarui; Yan, Su; Guan, Yongjun; Xu, Dongxue; He, Guangzhen; Chen, Chen; Xiong, Xingcheng; Liu, Lei; Li, Hanjun; Tao, Jing; Peng, Zhiyong; Wang, Weixing",Diabetes Care,,8

Thirty such samples (taken as cases) showing detectable CT of > 35 cycle in E-gene which were negative for other target genes of SARS-CoV-2 and 30 samples with undetectable fluorescence in E-gene were taken as controls for investigation. An in-vitro diagnostic approved commercial qRT-PCR multiplex kit detecting 33 respiratory pathogens which can also detect Haemophilus influenzae was used for screening the samples. It was observed that out of the 30 samples showing detectable CT> 35 in E-gene, 11 samples were positive for Haemophilus influenzae whereas in the controls only three samples were positive for H. influenzae (p-value: 0.03) which was statistically significant. Further, the probes and primers were screened against H. influenzae for matches in the genome. It was observed that all primers and probes for the E-gene of SARS-CoV-2 had over 13 bp long sequences matching 100% with multiple sites across the H. influenzae genome. This qRT-PCR primer & probes are being used extensively across India, and laboratories using them should be aware of the cross-reactivity of primers & probes with the H. influenzae genome. Further, the authors observed that 95.9% (5415/5642) of COVID-19 positive cases detected in their laboratory were asymptomatic at the time of collection of samples. This warrants further investigations.","Borkakoty, Biswajyoti; Bali, Nargis K",Indian J Med Microbiol,,8

The existing bimodal and trimodal sensors correspond to particular cases of those interference sensors. A thorough study of the properties of the multimode waveguide section provided a deeper insight into the behavior of this class of sensors, which allowed us to establish new criteria for designing more sensitive structures. Other challenges of using high-order modes within the sensing area of the device reside in the excitation of these modes and the interpretation of the output signal. To overcome these, we developed a novel structure to excite any desired high-order mode along with the fundamental mode within the sensing section, while maintaining a fine control over the power distribution between them. A new strategy to detect and interpret the output signal is also presented in detail. Finally, we designed a high-order sensor for which numerical simulations showed a theoretical limit of detection of 1.9×10-7 RIU, making this device the most sensitive multimode interference sensor reported so far.","Isayama, Yuri Hayashi; Hernández-Figueroa, Hugo Enrique",Sensors (Basel),,8

318844,Respiratory Virus Infections: Understanding COVID-19,2020,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is one of the most pressing health problems of this century, but our knowledge of the disease is still limited. In this study, we aimed to examine serum-soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) and kidney injury molecule 1 (KIM-1) levels based on the clinical course of COVID-19. Our study included 102 patients over the age of 18 who were diagnosed as having COVID-19 between September 2020 and December 2020 and a control group of 50 health workers over the age of 18 whose severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) PCR results were negative. KIM-1 was measured by ELISA and suPAR by suPARnostic&#8482; assay. Analysis of previously identified variables of prognostic significance in COVID-19 revealed high neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, lactose dehydrogenase, prothrombin time, C-reactive protein, PaO2 /FiO2 , D-dimer, ferritin, and fibrinogen levels in patients with severe disease (p < 0.05 for all). KIM-1 and suPAR levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared to the control group (p = 0.001 for all). KIM-1 level was higher in severe patients compared to moderate patients (p = 0.001), while suPAR level was lower (p = 0.001). KIM-1, which is believed to play an important role in the endocytosis of SARS-CoV-2, was elevated in patients with severe COVID-19 and may be a therapeutic target in the future. SuPAR may have a role in defense mechanism and fibrinolysis, and low levels in severe patients may be associated with poor prognosis in the early period.","Kerget, Bugra; Kerget, Ferhan; Aksakal, Alperen; Askin, Seda; Uçar, Elif Yilmazel; Saglam, Leyla",J Med Virol,,8

Methods • Data of COVID-19 cases in Jingzhou City from January 1 to March 12, 2020 were collected. Trend surface analysis, spatial autocorrelation and spatial-temporal scanning analysis were conducted to understand the spatial-temporal distribution of COVID-19 at town (street) level in Jingzhou City, and the spatial-temporal clustering characteristics of local cases and imported cases were compared. Results • Trend surface analysis showed that the incidence rate of COVID-19 in Jingzhou City was slightly ""U"" from west to east, slightly higher in the east, and inverted ""U"" from south to north, slightly higher in the south. Global autocorrelation showed that the incidence rate of COVID-19 in Jingzhou City was positively correlated (Moran's I=0.410, P=0.000). Local spatial autocorrelation analysis showed that the highly clustered areas and hot spot areas were mainly in Shashi District, Jingzhou District and the main urban area of Honghu City (Xindi Street) (P&lt;0.05).

319492,Cellular immune responses to covid-19,2020,"Various patch materials with variable cost are used for pulmonary artery reconstruction. An analysis of reintervention based on type of patch material might inform value-based decision making. This was a retrospective review of 214 sites of pulmonary artery reconstruction at a single center from 2000 to 2014. We excluded patients with unifocalization of aortopulmonary collaterals. Primary outcome was reintervention for each type of patch. Total number of patch sites was 214 (180 patients). Median follow-up was 3.7 years. Patch materials and number of sites were branch patch homograft (92), bovine pericardium (44), autologous pericardium (41), and porcine intestinal submucosal patch (37). Median age and weight at the time of patch reconstruction were 12.1 months and 8.5 kg. Reintervention occurred at 34 sites (15.9%). With Cox proportional hazards regression, the following variables were associated with reinterevention: preoperative renal failure - hazard ratio of 4.36 (1.87-10.16), p<0.001 and weight at surgery - hazard ratio 0.93 (0.89-0.98), p=0.004. Patch type was not related to reintervention (p=0.197). Cost per unit patch ranged from $0 (dollars, US) for untreated autologous pericardium to $6,105 for homograft branch patch. In this retrospective analysis, there was no relationship between type of patch used for main or central branch pulmonary artery reconstruction and subsequent reintervention on that site. This finding, combined with the widely disparate costs of patches, may help inform value-based decision making.","Ebert, Nicholas; McGinnis, Michael; Johnson, William; Kuhn, Evelyn M; Mitchell, Michael E; Tweddell, James S; Woods, Ronald K",Semin. thorac. cardiovasc. surg,,8

PURPOSE: The study aims to examine the ethical sensitivity levels of physicians and nurses working in surgical units during the Covid-19 pandemic and the associating factors. METHOD: The sample of this cross-sectional online questionnaire-based study consists of 161 healthcare workers working at the surgical units in Turkish hospitals. The data were collected using the ""Nurse Descriptive Information Form"" developed by the researchers and the ""Ethical Sensitivity Questionnaire."" ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS: Approval was granted by the ethics committee. Verbal and written consent was received from the healthcare workers. RESULTS: Ethical sensitivity in the dimension of conflict was found to be higher in healthcare workers who had ethical issues during the Covid-19 pandemic, who were married, who were nurses, who worked more than 45 h, and who had a work experience of 7-10 years (p < 0.05). Healthcare workers with a family member diagnosed with Covid-19 had high ethical sensitivity in the dimension of conflict (p = 0.008), while those who reported being fully competent and ready (p = 0.038) about Covid-19 were found to have low ethical sensitivity. Besides, those who experienced inadequate supplies (p = 0.045), long working hours (p = 0.038), and problems in asepsis-sterilization (p = 0.046) during the Covid-19 pandemic were found to have low sensitivity in the holistic approach dimension. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that ethical issues during the Covid-19 pandemic, sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge-skills about Covid-19, and the problems encountered in the work environment during the pandemic affect the ethical sensitivity of healthcare workers in the dimensions of conflict and holistic approach. Therefore, it is recommended that governments and all healthcare workers, and stakeholders in the health system in our country and other countries take action to promote ethical sensitivity in response to the rapidly increasing epidemic by considering the factors that adversely affect ethical sensitivity.","Mert, Selda; Sayilan, Aylin Aydin; Karatoprak, Ayfer Peker; Baydemir, Canan",Nurs Ethics,,8

We motivate the need for this type of classification as a pre-processing step for further analysis of social media data in the context of related work in this area. In this paper we present experiments for a three-way document classification by patient voice, professional voice or other. We present results for a convolutional neural network classifier trained on English data from two different data sources (Reddit and Twitter) and two domains (cardiovascular and skin diseases). RESULTS: We found that document classification by patient voice, professional voice or other can be done consistently manually (0.92 accuracy). Annotators agreed roughly equally for each domain (cardiovascular and skin) but they agreed more when annotating Reddit posts compared to Twitter posts. Best classification performance was obtained when training two separate classifiers for each data source, one for Reddit and one for Twitter posts, when evaluating on in-source test data for both test sets combined with an overall accuracy of 0.95 (and macro-average F1 of 0.92) and an F1-score of 0.95 for patient voice only. CONCLUSION: The main conclusion resulting from this work is that combining social media data from platforms with different characteristics for training a patient and professional voice classifier does not result in best possible performance. We showed that it is best to train separate models per data source (Reddit and Twitter) instead of a model using the combined training data from both sources. We also found that it is preferable to train separate models per domain (cardiovascular and skin) while showing that the difference to the combined model is only minor (0.01 accuracy). Our highest overall F1-score (0.95) obtained for classifying posts as patient voice is a very good starting point for further analysis of social media data reflecting the experience of patients.","Alex, Beatrice; Whyte, Donald; Duma, Daniel; Owen, Roma English; Fairley, Elizabeth A L",BMC Med Inform Decis Mak,,8

Although few people will dispute that global food systems need transformation, it has become clear that the Summit is instead an effort by a powerful alliance of multinational corporations, philanthropies, and export-oriented countries to subvert multilateral institutions of food governance and capture the global narrative of “food systems transformation.” This article places the upcoming Summit in the context of previous world food summits and analyzes concerns that have been voiced by many within civil society. It elaborates how the current structure and forms of participant recruitment and public engagement lack basic transparency and accountability, fail to address significant conflicts of interest, and ignore human rights. As the COVID-19 pandemic illuminates the structural vulnerabilities of the neoliberal model of food systems and the consequences of climate change for food production, a high-level commitment to equitable and sustainable food systems is needed now more than ever. However, the authors suggest that the UNFSS instead seems to follow a trajectory in which efforts to govern global food systems in the public interest has been subverted to maintain colonial and corporate forms of control. © Copyright © 2021 Canfield, Anderson and McMichael.","Canfield, M.; Anderson, M.

321032,Seasonal Influenza Vaccination,2020,"The dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 replication and shedding in humans remain poorly understood. We captured the dynamics of infectious virus and viral RNA shedding during acute infection through daily longitudinal sampling of 60 individuals for up to 14 days. By fitting mechanistic models, we directly estimate viral reproduction and clearance rates, and overall infectiousness for each individual. Significant person-to-person variation in infectious virus shedding suggests that individual-level heterogeneity in viral dynamics contributes to superspreading. Viral genome load often peaked days earlier in saliva than in nasal swabs, indicating strong compartmentalization and suggesting that saliva may serve as a superior sampling site for early detection of infection. Viral loads and clearance kinetics of B.1.1.7 and non-B.1.1.7 viruses in nasal swabs were indistinguishable, however B.1.1.7 exhibited a significantly slower pre-peak growth rate in saliva. These results provide a high-resolution portrait of SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics and implicate individual-level heterogeneity in infectiousness in superspreading.","Ke, Ruian; Martinez, Pamela P; Smith, Rebecca L; Gibson, Laura L; Mirza, Agha; Conte, Madison; Gallagher, Nicholas; Luo, Chun Huai; Jarrett, Junko; Conte, Abigail; Liu, Tongyu; Farjo, Mireille; Walden, Kimberly K.O.; Rendon, Gloria; Fields, Christopher J.; Wang, Leyi; Fredrickson, Richard; Edmonson, Darci C; Baughman, Melinda E; Chiu, Karen K; Choi, Hannah; Scardina, Kevin R; Bradley, Shannon; Gloss, Stacy L; Reinhart, Crystal; Yedetore, Jagadeesh; Quicksall, Jessica; Owens, Alyssa N; Broach, John; Barton, Bruce; Lazar, Peter; Heetderks, William; Robinson, Matthew L; Mostafa, Heba H; Manabe, Yukari C; Pekosz, Andrew; McManus, David D; Brooke, Christopher B",,,8

326028,MST2 silencing induces apoptosis and inhibits tumor growth for estrogen receptor alpha-positive MCF-7 breast cancer,2020,"BACKGROUND: It has been recognised for a considerable time-period, that viral respiratory infections predispose patients to bacterial infections, and that these co-infections have a worse outcome than either infection on its own However, it is still unclear what exact roles co-infections and/or superinfections play in patients with COVID-19 infection MAIN BODY: This was an extensive review of the current literature regarding co-infections and superinfections in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection The definitions used were those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US), which defines coinfection as one occurring concurrently with the initial infection, while superinfections are those infections that follow on a previous infection, especially when caused by microorganisms that are resistant, or have become resistant, to the antibiotics used earlier Some researchers have envisioned three potential scenarios of bacterial/SARS-CoV-2 co-infection;namely, secondary SARS-CoV-2 infection following bacterial infection or colonisation, combined viral/bacterial pneumonia, or secondary bacterial superinfection following SARS-CoV-2 There are a myriad of published articles ranging from letters to the editor to systematic reviews and meta-analyses describing varying ranges of co-infection and/or superinfection in patients with COVID-19 The concomitant infections described included other respiratory viruses, bacteria, including mycobacteria, fungi, as well as other, more unusual, pathogens However, as will be seen in this review, there is often not a clear distinction made in the literature as to what the authors are referring to, whether true concomitant/co-infections or superinfections In addition, possible mechanisms of the interactions between viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2, and other infections, particularly bacterial infections are discussed further Lastly, the impact of these co-infections and superinfections in the severity of COVID-19 infections and their outcome is also described CONCLUSION: The current review describes varying rates of co-infections and/or superinfections in patients with COVID-19 infections, although often a clear distinction between the two is not clear in the literature When they occur, these infections appear to be associated with both severity of COVID-19 as well as poorer outcomes","Feldman, C.; Anderson, R.",Pneumonia (Nathan),,8

326351,Human cell receptors: potential drug targets to combat COVID-19,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Studies on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) have mainly focused on hospitalized patients or those with severe disease. We aim to assess the clinical characteristics, outcomes and factors associated with hospital admission or death in adult outpatients with COVID-19. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort of outpatients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, registered in Covidom telesurveillance solution for home monitoring of patients with COVID-19 in the Greater Paris area, from March to August 2020. The primary outcome was clinical worsening, defined as hospitalization or death within 1 month after symptom onset. RESULTS: Among 43,103 patients, mean age was 42.9 years (SD=14.3); 93.0% (n=40,081) of patients were < 65 years old and 61.9% (n=26,688) were women. Of these 43,103 patients, 67.5% (n=29,104) completed a medical questionnaire on comorbidities and symptoms. The main reported comorbidities were asthma (12.8%; n=3,685), hypertension (12.3%; n=3,546) and diabetes (4.8%; n=1,385). A small proportion of all eligible patients (4.1% [95% CI: 3.9-4.2]; 1,751/43,103) experienced clinical worsening. The rate of hospitalisation was 4.0% (95% CI: 3.8-4.2; n=1,728) and 0.1% (95% CI: 0.1-0.2; n=64) died. Factors associated with clinical worsening were male sex, older age, obesity and comorbidities such as chronic renal disease or cancer under treatment. Probability of worsening was reduced with anosmia/ageusia. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical worsening was rare among outpatients. Male sex, older age and comorbidities such as chronic renal disease, active cancers or obesity were independently associated with clinical worsening. However, our cohort may include patients younger and healthier than the general population.","Yordanov, Youri; Dinh, Aurélien; Bleibtreu, Alexandre; Mensch, Arthur; Lescure, François-Xavier; Debuc, Erwan; Jourdain, Patrick; Jaulmes, Luc; Dechartres, Agnes",Clin. microbiol. infect,,8

This paper focuses on Veterans as a potentially vulnerable group that might be systematically more exposed to infection than others because of their co-morbidities, i.e., greater incidence of physical and mental health challenges. Using data on 122 Veteran Healthcare Systems (HCS), this paper tests three machine learning models for predictive analysis. The combined LASSO and ridge regression with five-fold cross validation performs the best. We find that socio-demographic features are highly predictive of both cases and deaths-even more important than any hospital-specific characteristics. These results suggest that socio-demographic and social capital characteristics are important determinants of public health outcomes, especially for vulnerable groups, like Veterans, and they should be investigated further.","Makridis, Christos A; Mudide, Anish; Alterovitz, Gil",Pac Symp Biocomput,,8

We reported 211 COVID-19 patients and 115 influenza patients as two separate cohorts at different locations. Demographic data, medical history, laboratory findings, and radiological characters were summarized and compared between two cohorts, as well as between patients at the intensive care unit (ICU) andnon-ICU within the COVID-19 cohort. For all 326 patients, the median age was 57.0 (interquartile range: 45.0-69.0) and 48.2% was male, while 43.9% had comorbidities that included hypertension, diabetes, bronchitis, and heart diseases. Patients had cough (75.5%), fever (69.3%), expectoration (41.1%), dyspnea (19.3%), chest pain (18.7%), and fatigue (16.0%), etc. Both viral infections caused substantial blood abnormality, whereas the COVID-19 cohort showed a lower frequency of leukocytosis, neutrophilia, or lymphocytopenia, but a higher chance of creatine kinase elevation. A total of 7.7% of all patients possessed no abnormal sign in chest computed tomography (CT) scans. For both infections, pulmonary lesions in radiological findings did not show any difference in their location or distribution. Nevertheless, compared to the influenza cohort, the COVID-19 cohort presented more diversity in CT features, where certain specific CT patterns showed significantly more frequency, including consolidation, crazy paving pattern, rounded opacities, air bronchogram, tree-in-bud sign, interlobular septal thickening, and bronchiolar wall thickening. Differentiable clinical manifestations and CT patterns may help diagnose COVID-19 from influenza and gain a better understanding of both contagious respiratory illnesses.","Zhang, Jianguo; Ding, Daoyin; Huang, Xing; Zhang, Jinhui; Chen, Deyu; Fu, Peiwen; Shi, Yinghong; Xu, Wenrong; Tao, Zhimin",J. med. virol,,8

Despite the good specificity of the assays certified for SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection, and a theoretical sensitivity of few viral gene copies per reaction, a relatively high rate of false negatives continues to be reported. This is an important challenge in the management of patients on hospital admission and for correct monitoring of the infectivity after the acute phase. In the present report, we show that the use of digital PCR, a high sensitivity method to detect low amplicon numbers, allowed us to correctly detecting infection in swab material in a significant number of false negatives. We show that the implementation of digital PCR methods in the diagnostic assessment of COVID-19 could resolve, at least in part, this timely issue.","Poggio, Paolo; Songia, Paola; Vavassori, Chiara; Ricci, Veronica; Banfi, Cristina; Barbieri, Silvia Stella; Garoffolo, Gloria; Myasoedova, Veronika A; Piacentini, Luca; Raucci, Angela; Scopece, Alessandro; Sommariva, Elena; Vinci, Maria Cristina; Carcione, Davide; Biondi, Maria Luisa; Mancini, Maria Elisabetta; Formenti, Alberto; Andreini, Daniele; Assanelli, Emilio M; Agostoni, Piergiuseppe; Camera, Marina; Colombo, Gualtiero I; Pesce, Maurizio",Sci Rep,,8
334141,Movement and transmission of human exhaled droplets/droplet nuclei,2021,"Background: The outbreak of the novel 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. The diagnosis of COVID-19 is frequently based on a positive serological test. We noted the occurrence of false-positive results for COVID-19 in the colloidal gold-based immunochromatographic strip (ICS) assay in sera from patients with autoimmune diseases (ADs). This study aimed to evaluate the possible reasons for the false-positive results in two ICS assays (Wondfo ICS and Innovita ICS) and to investigate the effect of urea dissociation in reducing false-positive results. Methods: The sera of 135 patients with ADs, 13 confirmed COVID-19 patients, 95 disease controls, and 120 healthy controls were tested for immunoglobin M (IgM) and IgG against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) using Wondfo and Innovita ICS kits. The distributions of auto-antibodies in antibody-positive and antibody-negative groups were also compared, and bivariable logistic regression was used to assess auto-antibodies associated with false-positive results. A urea dissociation test of ICS was performed for the SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive samples. Results: Specificity of Wondfo ICS for the 95 disease controls was 94.74% compared to 98.95% and 96.84% for Innovita SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG, respectively. Specificity of Wondfo ICS for the 120 healthy controls was 97.5% compared to 100% and 99.17% for Innovita SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG, respectively. Specificity of Wondfo ICS for AD patients was 73.33% compared to 97.78% and 96.30% for Innovita SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG, respectively. Sensitivity was 74.07% for Wondfo compared to 70.37% for Innovita IgM and 66.67% for Innovita IgG. Using the Wondfo ICS, the percentage of elevated rheumatoid factor (RF) level (&gt;20 IU/mL) was higher in the SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive group compared with the antibody-negative group [27/36 (75.0%) vs. 34/99 (34.34%), P=0.001]. The elevated RF was associated with antibody positivity, with an odds ratio of 4.671 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.88-11.69]. The specificity of the Wondfo ICS assay for the AD patients was increased from 73.33% to 94.07% after the urea dissociation assay. Conclusions: An elevated serum RF level could lead to false-positive results when detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies using the Wondfo ICS kit, and the urea dissociation assay would be helpful in reducing the incidence of false-positive results.","Xiao, X.; Zhou, Q.; Zhu, J.; Sun, L.; Zhang, H.; Sun, Y.; Zhao, J.; Cui, L.",Annals of Translational Medicine,,8

There are very few paediatric studies and are mainly from developed countries with a paucity of information on the clinical manifestation of COVID-19 disease in African children, including Nigeria. Methods: We described the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, treatment and outcome in a group of five Nigerian children managed at a COVID-19 isolation and treatment centre in Nigeria. Results: We managed a total of five children with an age range of 3 months to 8 years in the last four weeks (16th April to 15th May 2020). Three of the five children were males. All the children had close contact with family members that tested positive for COVID-19. Out of the five children, one had moderate disease, three had mild symptomatic disease, and one was asymptomatic. Two out of the five children had lymphocytosis. Out of the four children who had chest radiograph, two had features of pneumonia. Conclusion: COVID-19 is not uncommon in Nigerian children, and all had a confirmed family member with COVID-19. Besides, contrary to leucopaenia with lymphopaenia observed in the adult's population, we found lymphocytosis in this cohort and about 50.0% had pneumonic changes on chest radiograph.","Ibrahim, Olayinka Rasheed; Suleiman, Bello Mohammed; Sanda, Abdallah; Oloyede, Taofeek; Bello, Surajudeen Oyeleke; Bello, Umar Ibrahim; Yahaya, Shamsudeen; Dawud, Adamu; Bashir, Sulaiman Saidu",Pan Afr Med J,,8

Attempts to control the growth of the virus using masks and social-distancing, and, recently, double-masking as well, continue to be difficult to maintain, in part due to the extent of asymptomatic cases. Analyses of large datasets consisting of 219,075 individual cases in Ontario, indicated that asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases are substantial in number. Large numbers of cases in children aged 0-9 were asymptomatic or had only one symptom (35.0% and 31.4% of total cases, respectively) and resulted in fever as the most common symptom (30.6% of total cases). COVID-19 cases in children were more likely to be milder symptomatic with cough not seen as frequently as in adults aged over 40, and past research has shown children to be index cases in familial clusters. These findings highlight the importance of targeting asymptomatic and mild infections in the continuing effort to control the spread of COVID-19. The Pearson correlation coefficient between test positivity rates and asymptomatic rates of -0.729 indicates that estimates of the asymptomatic rates should be obtained when the test positivity rates are lowest as the best approach.","Snider, B.; Patel, B.; McBean, E.",Infectious Disease Reports,,8

340332,Rural Matters - Coronavirus and the Navajo Nation,2020,"The extensive efforts around the globe are being made to develop a suitable vaccine against COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2). An effective vaccine should be able to induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies to prevent the virus from attaching to the host cell receptors. However, to elicit the protective levels of antibodies, a vaccine may require multiple doses or assistance from other immunostimulatory molecules. Further, the vaccine should be able to induce protective levels of antibodies rapidly with the least amount of antigen used. This decreases the cost of a vaccine and makes it affordable. As the pandemic has hit most countries across the globe, there will be an overwhelming demand for the vaccine in a quick time. Incorporating a suitable adjuvant in a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine may address these requirements. This review paper will discuss the experimental results of the adjuvanted vaccine studies with similar coronaviruses (CoVs) which might be useful to select an appropriate adjuvant for a vaccine against rapidly emergingSARS-CoV-2. We also discuss the current progress in the development of adjuvanted vaccines against the disease.","Gupta, Tania; Gupta, Shishir K",Int Immunopharmacol,,8

AIM: Audit of roles undertaken by Surgical Care Practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of Royal College of Surgeons (2014) Curriculum to review the utilisation of this medical associate profession role. METHOD: The online questionnaire service, SurveyMonkey®, was used to collect data on the activities being undertaken by the Surgical Care Practitioner during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Eighty Surgical Care Practitioners from across seven different surgical specialties within the United Kingdom completed the online survey. Nearly half stated that they remained mostly working in their substantive role, just less than a third helped in critical care units, with the remaining redeployed in equal shares to emergency departments or assisting on wards with nurses and as part of medical teams.

By 16 March 2020, 681 United Kingdom behavioral scientists had signed an open letter to their government asking it to reveal the evidence that shows that behavioral fatigue exists. Nothing was forthcoming. The provenance of concept remains a mystery but modelers have argued that the delay in implementing lockdown policies, for which it was at least partly responsible, led to the loss of at least 20,000 lives. Here, I consider whether behavioral fatigue is a real phenomenon by assessing (a) direct evidence consistent and inconsistent with its existence and (b) indirect evidence drawn from other domains. I conclude that evidence for it is not sufficient to constrain policy. It is reasonable to conclude that behavioral fatigue is either a naïve construct or a myth that arose during the development of policy designed to tackle the Covid-19 crisis.","Harvey, Nigel",Front Psychol,,8

These alerts provide a clear starting point from which to study the early response of the medical and scientific community to a new disease in terms of scientific publications, and to compare the timeline of this response with levels of general public interest. To this aim, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of articles on this disease published between 1 April and 5 July 2020. METHOD: A literature search was performed using PubMed and in three preprint repositories. For each article, the name used for the disease in the title, the number of authors, the number of patients, the citations according to Google Scholar, the journal impact factor, and the Altmetric score were retrieved. Google search trends for the terms ""Kawasaki"" and ""COVID,"" ""COVID-19,"" and ""coronavirus"" were also retrieved, as was the number of Reuters news articles published on the topic. These data were compared longitudinally on a weekly basis. The quality of the reporting of the study was evaluated using the STROBE guidelines for observational studies with more than three patients and using the CARE guidelines for case reports of three or fewer patients. RESULTS: Eighty-six articles were included, among which ten were preprints (three of which were subsequently published) and 49 were clinical articles (57%). A total of 857 patients were described. The median number of authors per article was five (range, 1-45), the median number of patients was four (1-186), the median number of citations was one (0-170), the median Altmetric score was 12 (0-7242), and the median journal impact factor was 3.7 (1-74.7). For the clinical articles, the median percentage of STROBE or CARE checklist items satisfied was 70% (IQR, 56.75-79.25; range, 40-90). Guideline adherence was significantly higher for observational studies than for case reports (median percentage of checklist items satisfied, 78.5% vs 61.5%; P<0.001); however, guideline adherence did not differ significantly between peer-reviewed and preprint articles (median percentage of checklist items satisfied, 57% vs 72%; P=0.205). The only statistically significant difference between clinical articles and other types of articles was the number of authors (median, 7 vs 2; P=2.53E-9). Fifty-seven of the 86 articles were authored by researchers from just three countries (the USA, 31; France, 14; and the UK, 12). The names most frequently used in the title were Kawasaki-like disease (n=37), followed by MIS-C (n=27), PIM-TS (n=14), and other names involving the term ""inflammatory"" (n=12). Google searches for related terms peaked between weeks 18 and 21, following the initial alerts and decreased rapidly thereafter. The number of Reuters articles on the subject was correlated with Google search trends (&#961;: 0.86, 95% CI [0.59; 0.96]; P=0.00016), but the number of medical articles published was not (&#961;: -0.54, 95% CI [-0.87; 0.14]; P=0.11). The first small case series was published less than 2 weeks after the initial alert; however, if all articles had been deposited as preprints when they were submitted to journals, the cumulative number of reported cases would have been 300% higher in week 18 (3 vs 1), 400% higher in week 19 (44 vs 11), 70% higher in week 20 (124 vs 73), and 54% higher in week 21 (129 vs 84). CONCLUSION: In a period of 9 weeks after the initial alerts from European pediatric societies, 85 medical articles were published, involving 856 patients (one case report was published before the alerts), allowing rapid dissemination of research information. However, general public interest followed the news cycle rather than scientific releases. The quality of the reporting, as assessed by adherence to STROBE or CARE guidelines, was adequate with more than two-thirds of checklist items satisfied. Learned societies play an important role in the early dissemination of up-to-date peer-reviewed information. Preprint deposition should be encouraged to accelerate the dissemination of research information.","Morand, A; Urbina, D; Giovannini-Chami, L; Fabre, A",Arch. pediatr,,8
344955,Polymorphisms of genes related to phase-I metabolic enzymes affecting the clinical efficacy and safety of clopidogrel treatment,2021,"BACKGROUND: General population surveys have shown that some groups, particularly young women, experienced increased distress during nationally mandated restrictions to control the spread of COVID-19. However, there has been limited research on such trends among people with pre-existing mental health conditions, leaving mental health services ill equipped to plan for current and future lockdowns. METHODS: Mean weekly scores on the GAD-7 and PHQ-9 between 01/01/2020-22/06/2020 (n=9,538 individuals) for all patients of two psychological treatment services (Improving Access to Psychological Therapies) in London, were compared to mean weekly scores from the same time periods in 2017-2019 (n=37,849). The proportion of scores which were above the clinical thresholds for 'caseness' each week were compared, and scores between groups based on gender, age group, and ethnicity, were also compared. RESULTS: Confirmed community transmission in the UK (26/02/2020-03/03/2020) and the announcement of the national 'lockdown' (23/03/2020) were associated with significant increases in anxiety symptom scores. 'Lockdown' was associated with a decrease in depression scores. These changes were not maintained during lockdown. Significant increases in depression and anxiety were observed at week 23, as restrictions were eased. LIMITATIONS: This was an exploratory analysis in two services only. Residual confounding and selection biases cannot be ruled out. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the weekly average symptom scores were short-term; they did not continue throughout 'lockdown' as might have been expected, except among older people. Replication of this study in other settings and investigating the potential benefits of more regular reviews or more intensive treatments for at-risk groups, are warranted.","Saunders, Rob; Buckman, Joshua E J; Leibowitz, Judy; Cape, John; Pilling, Stephen",J Affect Disord,,8
345430,Holding Up,2020,"As the COVID-19 pandemic has forced all Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to transfer teaching to online platforms, intricate questions in relation to remote teaching and learning dominate the discourse. Teacher educators (TEs) are now tasked with designing online modules, facilitating online learning, and providing direct instruction for students online. There is a dearth of literature which explores how TEs understand and enact pedagogies for the asynchronous learning environment (i.e. facilitate teaching presence). Also missing from the literature are specific features of professional development (PD) experiences which develop that essential knowledge base. This paper reports on a mixed methods study which explores how TEs are best supported to facilitate teaching presence in an asynchronous learning environment. 123 TEs from a range of disciplines across 15 TE institutions in Ireland, participated in the study. Data were collected from an extensive online questionnaire, individual semi-structured interviews and focus group interviews. Significant challenges in relation to planning for the asynchronous learning environment, fostering students’ authentic engagement with module content and cultivating student interactivity were unearthed. Findings also outline critical characteristics of PD experiences which, from a TE-informed perspective, positively impact knowledge growth with particular reference to teaching presence in an asynchronous learning environment.

To date, no specific treatment has been proven to be effective for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). With the rapid increase of infected patients and deaths, it is urgent to explore an effective treatment for COVID-19. Current studies suggest that there exists cytokine storm in SARS-CoV-2-infected patient, some of the patients will develop to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multiple organ dysfunction, even death. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) possess the property of immunomodulation. Given the previous preclinical and clinical studies, MSCs therapy has been shown safety and efficacy in the treatment of respiratory failure or ARDS. Based on similar principles, MSCs therapy may also be an effective therapy in the treatment of COVID-19. In this study, we summarized the clinical outcomes of MSCs for ARDS patients in some preclinical and clinical studies, and discussed the application of MSCs for patients with COVID-19 in China and the related important issues with MSCs use during the outbreak.","Xiong, Jing; Bao, Lei; Qi, Hongbo; Feng, Zhichun; Shi, Yuan",Current stem cell research &amp; therapy (Online),,8

They are struggling to cope with the loss of the normalcy of their lives and the resulting sense of grief. As the loneliness and isolation required by social distancing can worsen grief, it is important to increase communication with children and include strategies to reduce stress and increase resilience. Storytelling is the oldest form of teaching and has multiple benefits, including identifying emotional states, developing a vocabulary to allow self-advocacy, encouraging the use of strategy, and promoting a sense of hope. In addition, models of positive psychological attitude can diminish anxiety and divert attention to a more productive and positive outlook. Stories are powerful tools and convey thoughts, ideas, and values while encouraging purposeful discussion. For children, hearing stories is a rich avenue to gain insight, resources, and approaches to cope with these unprecedented times. It would be helpful to explore the long-term effects on children of COVID-19-related confinement and loss.

350163,Combined effects of Telehealth and Modified Constraint-Induced Movement Therapy for Individuals with Chronic Hemiparesis,2020,"The service industry provides distributive services, producer services, personal services, and social services. These services largely breakdowns due to restrictions on border movements, confined travel and transportation services, a decline in international tourists' visitation, nationwide lockdowns, and maintaining social distancing in the population. Although these measures are highly needed to contain coronavirus, it decreases economic and financial activities in a country, which requires smart solutions to globally subsidize the services sector. The study used different COVID-19 measures, and its resulting impact on the services industry by using world aggregated data from 1975 through 2020. The study benefited from the Keynesian theory of aggregate demand that remains provided a solution to minimize economic shocks through stringent or liberalizing economic policies. The COVID-19 pandemic is more severe than the financial shocks of 2018 that affected almost all sectors of the globalized world, particularly the services sector, which has been severally affected by COVID-19; it is a high time to revisit economic policies to control pandemic recession. The study used quantiles regression and innovation accounting matrix to obtain ex-ante and ex-post analysis. The quantile regression estimates show that causes of death by communicable diseases, including COVID-19, mainly decline the share of services value added to the global GDP at different quantiles distribution. In contrast, word-of-mouth helps to prevent it from the transmission channel of coronavirus plague through information sharing among the general masses. The control of food prices and managing physical distancing reduces suspected coronavirus cases; however, it negatively affects the services sector's value share. The smart lockdown and sound economic activities do not decrease coronavirus cases, while they support increasing the percentage of the services sector to the global GDP. The innovation accounting matrix suggested that smart lockdown, managing physical distancing, effective price control, and sound financial activities will help to reduce coronavirus cases that will further translate into increased services value-added for the next ten years. The social distancing will exert a more considerable variance error shock to the services industry, which indicates the viability of these measures to contained novel coronavirus over a time horizon. The study used the number of proxies to the COVID-19 measures on the service sector that can be continued with real-time variables to obtain more inferences.","Yu, Donglei; Anser, Muhammad Khalid; Peng, Michael Yao-Ping; Nassani, Abdelmohsen A; Askar, Sameh E; Zaman, Khalid; Abdul Aziz, Abdul Rashid; Qazi Abro, Muhammad Moinuddin; Jabor, Mohd Khata",,,8

351211,Regulation of Over-the-Counter Hearing Aids - Deafening Silence from the FDA,2020,"BACKGROUND: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic has resulted in thousands of infections and deaths worldwide. Several therapies are currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the development of new drugs and the repositioning of existing drugs can only be achieved after the identification of potential therapeutic targets within structures, as this strategy provides the most precise solution for developing treatments for sudden epidemic infectious diseases. SUMMARY: In the current investigation, crystal and cryo-electron microscopy structures encoded by the SARS-CoV-2 genome were systematically examined for the identification of potential drug targets. These structures include nonstructural proteins (Nsp-9; Nsp-12; and Nsp-15), nucleocapsid (N) proteins, and the main protease (Mpro). Key Message: The structural information reveals the presence of many potential alternative therapeutic targets, primarily involved in interaction between N protein and Nsp3, forming replication-transcription complexes (RTCs) which might be a potential drug target for effective control of current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. RTCs consist of 16 nonstructural proteins (Nsp1-16) that play the most essential role in the synthesis of viral RNA. Targeting the physical linkage between the envelope and single-stranded positive RNA, a process facilitated by matrix proteins may provide a good alternative strategy. Our current study provides useful information for the development of new lead compounds against SARS-CoV-2 infections.","Khan, Muhammad Tahir; Irfan, Muhammad; Ahsan, Hina; Ahmed, Abrar; Kaushik, Aman Chandra; Khan, Anwar Sheed; Chinnasamy, Sathishkumar; Ali, Arif; Wei, Dong-Qing",Intervirology,,8

359555,"Epidemic Characteristics of 2019-nCoV in China, Jan 23, 2020-Feb 11, 2020",2020,"BACKGROUND: Obesity is a major public health problem globally and in Europe, while the prevalence of childhood obesity is also soaring. Several parameters of the living environment are contributing to this increase, such as the density of fast-food retailers, and thus, preventive health policies against childhood obesity must focus on the environment to which children are exposed. Currently, there are no systems to objectively measure the effect of living environment parameters on obesogenic behaviours and obesity. The H2020 project ""BigO: Big Data Against Childhood Obesity"" (http://bigoprogram.eu) aims to tackle childhood obesity by creating new sources of evidence based on big data. OBJECTIVE: This paper introduces the Obesity Prevention dashboard (OPdashboard), implemented in the context of BigO, which offers an interactive data exploration of objective obesity related behaviours and local environment based on the data recorded using the BigO mHealth app. METHODS: OPdashboard allows for (i) the real time monitoring of children's obesogenic behaviours in a city area, (ii) the extraction of associations between them and the local environment and, (iii) the evaluation of an intervention in time. More than 3700 children, from 33 schools and 2 clinics, in 5 European cities have been monitored using a custom-made mobile application for the extraction of behavioural patterns through the capturing of accelerometer and geolocation data, while online databases were assessed in order to have a description of the environment. RESULTS: The preliminary association outcomes in two European cities, namely Thessaloniki in Greece and Stockholm in Sweden, indicate a correlation between children's eating and physical activity behaviours and the availability of food related places or sport facilities close to schools. In addition, OPdashboard was used to assess the modification of children's physical activity as the result of the health policies applied for the deceleration of the COVID-19 outbreak. The preliminary outcomes of the analysis revealed that in urban areas the decrease on physical activity was statistically significant, while in the suburbs a slight increase was observed. Those findings suggest the importance of the availability of open spaces on children's behavioural change. The above analyses act as initial investigations using the OPdashboard. Additional factors must be incorporated in order to optimize its use and have a clearer understanding of the results. CONCLUSIONS: The paper describes in detail the OPdashboard which is exposed as a web interface (http://bigo.med.auth.gr:3838/). Its functionality was evaluated during a focus group with experts on public health, where its potential on the better understanding of the interplay between children's obesogenic behaviours and the environment was underlined.","Filos, Dimitris; Lekka, Irini; Kilintzis, Vasileios; Stefanopoulos, Leandros; Karavidopoulou, Youla; Maramis, Christos; Diou, Christos; Sarafis, Ioannis; Papapanagiotou, Vasileios; Alagialoglou, Leonidas; Ioakeimidis, Ioannis; Hassapidou, Maria; Charmandari, Evangelia; Heimeier, Rachel; O039,; Donnell, Shane; Doyle, Gerardine; Delopoulos, Anastasios; Maglaveras, Nicos",,,8
360433,Response to the emerging novel coronavirus outbreak,2020,"OBJECTIVES: Investigate whether resting-state EEG parameters recorded early poststroke can predict upper extremity motor impairment reflected by the Fugl-Meyer motor score (FM-UE) after six months, and whether they have prognostic value in addition to FM-UE at baseline. METHODS: Quantitative EEG parameters delta/alpha ratio (DAR), brain symmetry index (BSI) and directional BSI (BSIdir) were derived from 62-channel resting-state EEG recordings in 39 adults within three weeks after a first-ever ischemic hemispheric stroke. FM-UE scores were acquired within three weeks (FM-UEbaseline) and at 26 weeks poststroke (FM-UEw26). Linear regression analyses were performed using a forward selection procedure to predict FM-UEw26. RESULTS: BSI calculated over the theta band (BSItheta) (ß = -0.40; p = 0.013) was the strongest EEG-based predictor regarding FM-UEw26. BSItheta (ß = -0.27; p = 0.006) remained a significant predictor when added to a regression model including FM-UEbaseline, increasing explained variance from 61.5% to 68.1%. CONCLUSION: Higher BSItheta values, reflecting more power asymmetry over the hemispheres, predict more upper limb motor impairment six months after stroke. Moreover, BSItheta shows additive prognostic value regarding FM-UEw26 next to FM-UEbaseline scores, and thereby contains unique information regarding upper extremity motor recovery. SIGNIFICANCE: To our knowledge, we are the first to show that resting-state EEG parameters can serve as prognostic biomarkers of stroke recovery, in addition to FM-UEbaseline scores.","Saes, Mique; Meskers, Carel G M; Daffertshofer, Andreas; van Wegen, Erwin E H; Kwakkel, Gert",Clin Neurophysiol,,8

Purpose To describe the neuroimaging findings (excluding ischemic infarcts) in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection. Materials and Methods This was a retrospective study of patients evaluated from March 23, 2020, to April 27, 2020, at 16 hospitals. Inclusion criteria were (a) positive nasopharyngeal or lower respiratory tract reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assays, (b) severe COVID-19 infection defined as a requirement for hospitalization and oxygen therapy, (c) neurologic manifestations, and (d) abnormal brain MRI findings. Exclusion criteria were patients with missing or noncontributory data regarding brain MRI or brain MRI showing ischemic infarcts, cerebral venous thrombosis, or chronic lesions unrelated to the current event. Categorical data were compared using the Fisher exact test. Quantitative data were compared using the Student t test or Wilcoxon test. P < .05 represented a significant difference. Results Thirty men (81%) and seven women (19%) met the inclusion criteria, with a mean age of 61 years ± 12 (standard deviation) (age range, 8-78 years). The most common neurologic manifestations were alteration of consciousness (27 of 37, 73%), abnormal wakefulness when sedation was stopped (15 of 37, 41%), confusion (12 of 37, 32%), and agitation (seven of 37, 19%). The most frequent MRI findings were signal abnormalities located in the medial temporal lobe in 16 of 37 patients (43%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 27%, 59%), nonconfluent multifocal white matter hyperintense lesions seen with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery and diffusion-weighted sequences with variable enhancement, with associated hemorrhagic lesions in 11 of 37 patients (30%; 95% CI: 15%, 45%), and extensive and isolated white matter microhemorrhages in nine of 37 patients (24%; 95% CI: 10%, 38%). A majority of patients (20 of 37, 54%) had intracerebral hemorrhagic lesions with a more severe clinical presentation and a higher admission rate in intensive care units (20 of 20 patients [100%] vs 12 of 17 patients without hemorrhage [71%], P = .01) and development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (20 of 20 patients [100%] vs 11 of 17 patients [65%], P = .005). Only one patient had SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the cerebrospinal fluid.

Their administration is well accepted by the majority of patients because ODF dissolve upon in contact with the saliva in the oral cavity without need of water intake. ODF application in personalized pharmacotherapy is currently being exploited. Moreover, innovative preparation methods and characterization technologies have been evolving in recent years, highlighting promising future both from the technological and clinical standpoints. However, the key obstacles to the attainment of full potentials of ODF in the pharmaceutical field is the lack of harmonized and well-defined quality characterization procedures, standard evaluation parameters, guidance on appropriate final product properties and specifications. This review provides an appraisal on the ODF characterization methods from slurries to the finished medicinal products with a specific focus on the technologies suitable for identification, quantification, and quality evaluation of extemporaneously prepared ODF on small batches in individualized pharmacotherapy. Generally, there is a paradigm shift from the use of the conventional quality evaluation tools and/or protocols for oral solid dosage forms to characterize ODF to more specific equipment and procedures that suit the peculiarities of the ODF.","Khalid, Garba M; Selmin, Francesca; Musazzi, Umberto M; Gennari, Chiara G M; Minghetti, Paola; Cilurzo, Francesco",Curr. drug deliv,,8
364293,Disease-drug and drug-drug interaction in COVID-19: Risk and assessment,2021,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: COVID-19 is associated with liver injury and elevated IL-6. We hypothesized that IL-6 trans-signaling in liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) leads to endotheliopathy (a proinflammatory and procoagulant state) and liver injury in COVID-19. METHODS: Coagulopathy, endotheliopathy, and ALT were retrospectively analyzed in a subset (n=68), followed by a larger cohort(n=3,780) of COVID-19 patients. Liver histology from 43 COVID-19 patients was analyzed for endotheliopathy and its relationship to liver injury. Primary human LSECs were used to establish the IL-6 trans-signaling mechanism. RESULTS: Factor VIII, fibrinogen, D-dimer, vWF activity/antigen (biomarkers of coagulopathy/endotheliopathy) were significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients with liver injury (elevated ALT). IL-6 positively correlated with vWF antigen(P=0.02), factor VIII activity(P=0.02), and D-dimer(P<0.0001). On liver histology, COVID-19 patients with elevated ALT had significantly increased vWF and platelet staining, supporting a link between liver injury, coagulopathy, and endotheliopathy. Intralobular neutrophils positively correlated with platelet(P<0.0001) and vWF(P<0.01) staining, and IL-6 levels positively correlated with vWF staining(P<0.01). IL-6 trans-signaling leads to increased expression of procoagulant (Factor VIII, vWF) and proinflammatory factors, increased cell surface vWF(P<0.01), and increased platelet attachment in LSECs. These effects were blocked by soluble gp130 (IL-6 trans-signaling inhibitor), JAK inhibitor Ruxolitinib, and STAT1/3 siRNA knockdown. Hepatocyte fibrinogen expression was increased by the supernatant of LSECs subjected to IL-6 trans-signaling. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 is associated with coagulopathy and endotheliopathy in the liver endothelium driven by IL-6 trans-signaling, a possible mechanism of liver injury. LAY SUMMARY: Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection often have liver injury, but why this occurs remains unknown. High levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its circulating receptor, which form a complex to induce inflammatory signals, have been observed in COVID-19 patients. This paper demonstrates that the IL-6 signaling complex causes harmful changes to liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and may promote blood clotting and contribute to liver injury.","McConnell, Matthew J; Kawaguchi, Nao; Kondo, Reiichiro; Sonzogni, Aurelio; Licini, Lisa; Valle, Clarissa; Bonaffini, Pietro A; Sironi, Sandro; Alessio, Maria Grazia; Previtali, Giulia; Seghezzi, Michela; Zhang, Xuchen; Lee, Alfred; Pine, Alexander B; Chun, Hyung J; Zhang, Xinbo; Fernandez-Hernando, Carlos; Qing, Hua; Wang, Andrew; Price, Christina; Sun, Zhaoli; Utsumi, Teruo; Hwa, John; Strazzabosco, Mario; Iwakiri, Yasuko",J. hepatol,,8
364294,Disease-drug and drug-drug interaction in COVID-19: Risk and assessment,2021,"Currently, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide and continues to rise. There remains a significant unmet need for patients with hematological malignancies requiring specialized procedures and treatments, like cellular therapy to treat or cure their disease. For instance, chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy is approved for relapsed/refractory (after two or more lines of therapy) diffuse large B cell lymphoma and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that is refractory or in the second relapse in patients younger than 25 years of age. Similarly, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) can be a lifesaving procedure for many patients, such as those with acute myeloid leukemia with high-risk cytogenetics. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has thrust upon the hematologists and transplant specialists' unique challenges with the implementation and management of cellular therapy. One of the significant concerns regarding this immunocompromised patient population is the significant risk of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection due to its highly contagious nature. Experts have recommended that if medically indicated, especially in high-risk disease (where chemotherapy is unlikely to work), these lifesaving procedures should not be delayed even during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, proceeding with CAR-T cell therapy and HSCT during the pandemic is a considerable task and requires dedication from the transplant team and buy-in from the patients and their family or support system. Open conversations should be held with the patients about the risks involved in undergoing cellular therapies during current times and the associated future uncertainties.","Sahu, Kamal Kant; Ailawadhi, Sikander; Malvik, Natalie; Cerny, Jan",Adv Exp Med Biol,,8

In particular, in order to properly interpret the available data, it has become clear that one must go beyond most classic epidemiological models and consider models that, like the recently proposed SIDARTHE, offer a richer description of the stages of infection. The problem of learning the parameters of these models is of crucial importance especially when assuming that they are time-variant, which further enriches their effectiveness. In this paper we propose a general approach for learning time-variant parameters of dynamic compartmental models from epidemic data. We formulate the problem in terms of a functional risk that depends on the learning variables through the solutions of a dynamic system. The resulting variational problem is then solved by using a gradient flow on a suitable, regularized functional. We forecast the epidemic evolution in Italy and France. Results indicate that the model provides reliable and challenging predictions over all available data as well as the fundamental role of the chosen strategy on the time-variant parameters.","Zugarini, Andrea; Meloni, Enrico; Betti, Alessandro; Panizza, Andrea; Corneli, Marco; Gori, Marco",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14878v1.pdf,8

This approach aims to model relationships between dependent variable Covid-19 and independent variables from socioeconomic and pre-existing health conditions within the local government area (LGA) in New South Wales (NSW)-Australia. Based on geospatial data analysis and a step-by-step procedure in building both global and GWPR models, four (4) independent variables are finally selected to investigate relationships between dependent and independent variables at the local scale. The GWPR model's results with the Goodness-of-Fit (R2) range between 45-73% exhibit positive relationships between Covid-19 and the total population, the cancers, and the people with ages between 60 and 85 in most of the NSW state. Meanwhile, a negative relationship is observed between Covid-19 and the ischaemic heart disease; however, the estimated coefficients for this relationship are very low and close to zero; hence further investigation, including assessment from a different perspective, is necessary for validation. In conclusion, the model suggests that the relationships between the dependent variable and independent variables are nonstationary.

The weather parameters considered herein were air temperature, relative humidity, cumulative precipitation, and cloud cover, while sociodemographic factors included population density, median age, and government measures in response to the pandemic. The results of this study indicate that there is a statistically significant correlation between average atmospheric temperature and the COVID-19 case and death rates, with chi-square test p-values in the 0.001-0.02 range. Regarding sociodemographic factors, there is an even stronger dependence of the case and death rates on the population median age (p = 0.0006-0.0012).

As a large, quaternary care medical center, NYU Langone Medical Center was one of many New York medical centers that experienced an unprecedented influx of patients during this time. Clinical leadership effectively identified, oriented, and rapidly deployed a ""COVID Army,"" consisting of non-hospitalist physicians, to meet the needs of the patient influx. We share feedback from our providers on our processes and offer specific recommendations for systems experiencing a similar influx in the current and future pandemics. METHODS: To assess the experiences and perceived readiness of these physicians (n = 183), we distributed a 32-item survey between March and June of 2020. Thematic analyses and response rates were examined to develop results. RESULTS: Responses highlighted varying experiences and attitudes of our frontline physicians during an emerging pandemic. Thematic analyses revealed a series of lessons learned, including the need to (1) provide orientations, (2) clarify roles/workflow, (3) balance team workload, (4) keep teams updated on evolving policies, (5) make team members feel valued, and (6) ensure they have necessary tools available. CONCLUSIONS: Lessons from our deployment and assessment are scalable at other institutions.","Hauck, Kevin D; Hochman, Katherine A; Pochapin, Mark B; Zabar, Sondra R; Wilhite, Jeffrey A; Glynn, Gretchen; Bosworth, Brian P",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,8

372961,Buying time: Drug repurposing to treat the host in COVID-19H,2020,"We introduce a new method for inference in stochastic epidemic models which uses recursive multinomial approximations to integrate over unobserved variables and thus circumvent likelihood intractability. The method is applicable to a class of discrete-time, finite-population compartmental models with partial, randomly under-reported or missing count observations. In contrast to state-of-the-art alternatives such as Approximate Bayesian Computation techniques, no forward simulation of the model is required and there are no tuning parameters. Evaluating the approximate marginal likelihood of model parameters is achieved through a computationally simple filtering recursion. The accuracy of the approximation is demonstrated through analysis of real and simulated data using a model of the 1995 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo. We show how the method can be embedded within a Sequential Monte Carlo approach to estimating the time-varying reproduction number of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, recently published by Kucharski et al. 2020.","Whiteley, Nick; Rimella, Lorenzo",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13700v1.pdf,8

375612,Cascade of care for children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis C,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Ischaemic stroke has been reported in patients with COVID-19, particularly in more severe cases. However, it is unclear to what extent this is linked to systemic inflammation and hypercoagulability secondary to the infection. METHODS: We describe the cases of 4 patients with ischaemic stroke and COVID-19 who were attended at our hospital. Patients are classified according to the likelihood of a causal relationship between the hypercoagulable state and ischaemic stroke. We also conducted a review of studies addressing the possible mechanisms involved in the aetiopathogenesis of ischaemic stroke in these patients. RESULTS: The association between COVID-19 and stroke was probably causal in 2 patients, who presented cortical infarcts and had no relevant arterial or cardioembolic disease, but did show signs of hypercoagulability and systemic inflammation in laboratory analyses. The other 2 patients were of advanced age and presented cardioembolic ischaemic stroke; the association in these patients was probably incidental. CONCLUSIONS: Systemic inflammation and the potential direct action of the virus may cause endothelial dysfunction, resulting in a hypercoagulable state that could be considered a potential cause of ischaemic stroke. However, stroke involves multiple pathophysiological mechanisms; studies with larger samples are therefore needed to confirm our hypothesis. The management protocol for patients with stroke and COVID-19 should include a complete aetiological study, with the appropriate safety precautions always being observed.","Barrios-López, J M; Rego-García, I; Muñoz Martínez, C; Romero-Fábrega, J C; Rivero Rodríguez, M; Ruiz Giménez, J A; Escamilla-Sevilla, F; Mínguez-Castellanos, A; Fernández Pérez, M D",Neurologia,,8

To compare the virological and clinical responses to lopinavir-ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine treatment in COVID-19 patients. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included patients with COVID-19 treated with lopinavir-ritonavir or hydroxychloroquine at a single center in Korea from February 17 to March 31, 2020. Patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir and hydroxychloroquine concurrently and those treated with lopinavir-ritonavir or hydroxychloroquine for less than 7 days were excluded. Time to negative conversion of viral RNA, time to clinical improvement, and safety outcomes were assessed after 6 weeks of follow-up. Results: Of 65 patients (mean age, 64.3 years; 25 men [38.5%]), 31 were treated with lopinavir-ritonavir and 34 were treated with hydroxychloroquine. The median duration of symptoms before treatment was 7 days and 26 patients (40%) required oxygen support at baseline. Patients treated with lopinavir-ritonavir had a significantly shorter time to negative conversion of viral RNA than those treated with hydroxychloroquine (median, 21 days vs. 28 days). Treatment with lopinavir-ritonavir (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.24 to 4.21) and younger age (aHR, 2.64; 95% CI 1.43 to 4.87) was associated with negative conversion of viral RNA. There was no significant difference in time to clinical improvement between lopinavir-ritonavir- and hydroxychloroquine-treated patients (median, 18 days vs. 21 days). Lymphopenia and hyperbilirubinemia were more frequent in lopinavir-ritonavir-treated patients compared with hydroxychloroquine-treated patients. Conclusions: Lopinavir-ritonavir was associated with more rapid viral clearance than hydroxychloroquine in mild to moderate COVID-19, despite comparable clinical responses. These findings should be confirmed in randomized, controlled trials.","Kim, Ji-Won; Kim, Eun Jin; Kwon, Hyun Hee; Jung, Chi Young; Kim, Kyung Chan; Choe, Jung-Yoon; Hong, Hyo-Lim",Korean j. intern. med.,,8

Historical trends in Quebec and implications for Canada"", we assessed public health investments since the establishment of the Nova Scotia provincial health authority in 2015. We analyzed Nova Scotia Department of Health and Wellness budgets from 2015-2016 to 2019-2020 and observed that less than 1% of funding was budgeted for public health annually, an amount well below the recommendation that 5-6% of healthcare funding be spent on public health. Healthcare spending has increased annually since 2015-2016, but proportions of funding to different programs and services have remained static. Specifically, we did not observe a change in investment in public health over time, suggesting that while the government does not necessarily spend too much or too little on healthcare, it spends far too little on public health. This chronic under-funding is problematic given the high rates of non-communicable diseases in Nova Scotia and health inequities experienced within the population. The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of public health work, and the need for a pandemic recovery plan that prioritizes investment in all areas of public health in Nova Scotia.","Caldwell, Hilary A T; Scruton, Sarah; Fierlbeck, Katherine; Hajizadeh, Mohammad; Dave, Shivani; Sim, S Meaghan; Kirk, Sara F L",Can J Public Health,,8

386186,Could the novel coronavirus infect North American bats?,2020,"The emergence of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, highlights the increasing need for new and effective antiviral and antimicrobial agents. The FDA has recently banned several active ingredients used in hand sanitizers, including triclosan and benzethonium chloride. Nitric oxide (NO) is involved in the innate immune response and is a major component of macrophage-mediated attack on foreign viruses and bacteria. The specific aim of this study was to assess the antibacterial effects of 2-(N,N-diethylamino)-diazenolate-2-oxide (DEA-NONOate) against Escherichia coli (E. coli). A bacterial growth assay was compared to an adenosine triphosphate (ATP) activity assay at various time points to assess effects of DEA-NONOate on E. coli growth. A UV/Vis spectrophotometer was used to determine concentration of E. coli by measuring optical density (OD) at 630 nm. A luminescent assay was used to measure ATP activity correlating to viable cells. DEA-NONOate at a concentration of 65 mM was able to inhibit the growth of E. coli with the same efficacy as 1 µg ml-1 concentration of ciprofloxacin. Both the OD and ATP assays demonstrated a 99.9% reduction in E. coli. Both a 1 µg ml-1 concentration of ciprofloxacin and a 65 mM concentration of DEA-NONOate achieved 99.9% inhibition of E. coli, verified using both optical density measurement of bacterial cultures in 96 well plates and a luminescent ATP activity assay. The bactericidal effects of DEA-NONOate against E. coli is proof-of-concept to pursue evaluation of nitric oxide-based formulations as antimicrobial and antiviral agents as hand sanitizers.","Sysel, Annette M; Dunphy, Michael J; Bauer, Joseph A",J. antibiot,,8

Developing effective control measures for COVID-19, especially measures that can halt the worsening of severe cases to a critical status is of urgent importance. CASE SUMMARY A 52-year-old woman presented with a high fever (38.8 °C), chills, dizziness, and weakness. Epidemiologically, she had not been to Wuhan where COVID-19 emerged and did not have a family history of a disease cluster. A blood test yielded a white blood cell count of 4.41 x 109/L (60.6 ± 2.67% neutrophils and 30.4 ± 1.34% lymphocytes). Chest imaging revealed bilateral ground-glass lung changes. Based on a positive nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test result and clinical characteristics, the patient was diagnosed with COVID-19. Following treatment with early non-invasive ventilation and a bundle pharmacotherapy, she recovered with a good outcome. CONCLUSION Early non-invasive ventilation with a bundle pharmacotherapy may be an effective treatment regimen for the broader population of patients with COVID-19.","Peng, Mian; Ren, Di; Liu, Xue-Yan; Li, Jin-Xiu; Chen, Rong-Lin; Yu, Bao-Jun; Liu, Yong-Feng; Meng, Xi; Lyu, Yan-Si",World J.

The paper presents a thematic literature review focused on gender inclusion in bike-sharing schemes. The proposed methodological approach is based on (i) Geographic Information Systems for the analysis of geolocated open datasets related to land, sociodemographic and mobility characteristics of the areas surrounding each docking stations. This was aimed at identifying a short list of suitable bike-sharing docking stations, which were further characterized through: (ii) structured proprietary data focused on travel demand;(iii) onsite observations focused on universal design indicators;(iv) survey questionnaires focused on women’s concerns, needs and expectations;and (v) social media data from Twitter focused on the opinion of the end-users. Results showed that women use the VELIB’s bike-sharing service much less than men (about 30% of the total number of users), since they are more concerned about the following issues: accessibility (e.g., availability of bikes at the docking stations, distance to the nearest station, type and quality of the cycle paths);safety and security (e.g., perception of danger and insecurity while cycling and using the current bicycle infrastructures);social constraints (e.g., perceptions and cultural stigmatization associated with cycling and bike-sharing);weather and topography (e.g., impact of weather and the urban terrain on cycling and bike-sharing). The final aim of the H2020 DIAMOND project is to support the definition of guidelines and policies for the inclusion of women’s needs in the design of future bike-sharing services.","Gorrini, Andrea Choubassi Rawad Messa Federico Saleh Wafaa Ababio-Donkor Augustus Leva Maria Chiara Lorraine D’Arcy Fabbri Francesco Laniado David Aragón Pablo",Sustainability,,8

Herd immunity through vaccination is our major expectation to rein the virus. However, the emergence of widespread genetic variants could potentially undermine the vaccines. The evidence that some variants could evade immune responses elicited by vaccines and previous infection is growing. In this review, we summarized the current understanding on five notable genetic variants, i.e., D614G, Cluster 5, VOC 202012/01, 501Y.V2 and P.1, and discussed the potential impact of these variants on the virus transmission, pathogenesis and vaccine efficacy. We also highlight that mutations in the N-terminal domain of spike protein should be considered when evaluating the antibody neutralization abilities. Among these genetic variants, a concern of genetic variant 501Y.V2 to escape the protection by vaccines was raised. We therefore call for new vaccines targeting this variant to be developed.","Guo, Shuxin; Liu, Kefang; Zheng, Jun",Int J Biol Sci,,8
402328,Recent progress in the field of artificial organs,2020,"Restricting human movement to decrease contact probability and frequency helps mitigate large-scale epidemics Movement-based zoning can be implemented to delineate the boundaries for movement restrictions Previous studies used network community detection methods, which capture cohesive within-region movements, to delineate containment zones However, most people usually travel and spend most of their time in several fixed locations, which implies that an infected person could transmit the pathogens to only a specific group of people with whom s/he usually has a contact in frequently-visited locations Existing network community detection methods cannot reflect the regularity of the flow of people;thus, this study aims to use land-use patterns to reflect trip purposes to measure the regularity of human mobility We propose a novel network community detection method, the Human Mobility Regularity-based Zoning (HuMoRZ) algorithm, to delineate containment zones incorporating mobility regularity The Taipei metropolitan area in Taiwan is used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm The spatial diffusion of an emerging respiratory disease, novel influenza A/H1N1, is simulated for comparing three different quarantine zoning systems: (1) a minimum zoning unit, (2) optimal zoning without considering mobility regularity, and (3) optimal zoning considering mobility regularity Two epidemiological performance indicators are used to compare simulation results: namely, the accumulated infected number (AN) on the 30th day, reflecting the severity of an epidemic, and the critical time (CT), the moment at which half of the population becomes infected, measuring the diffusion speed of an epidemic To measure the variety of different facility types within a containment zone, we further use Shannon's entropy scores, representing a self-contained zone, and the boxplot of all zones' entropy scores, reflecting geospatial homogeneity of life functions across zones Our results suggest that containment zones that incorporate mobility regularity could significantly delay the epidemic peak and critical time and decrease the severity of an epidemic The zoning patterns proposed in our algorithm could also allow for more life functions in a zone and more evenly distributed life resources across zones than those of zones generated by other methods These findings could provide insightful implications for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic","Kuo, Fei-Ying Wen Tzai-Hung",Applied Geography,,8

404156,The emerging osteo-metabolic phenotype of COVID-19: clinical and pathophysiological aspects,2021,"Multi-class segmentation of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) images seeks a separation of data into anatomical components with known structure and configuration. The most popular CNN-based methods are optimised using pixel wise loss functions, ignorant of the spatially extended features that characterise anatomy. Therefore, whilst sharing a high spatial overlap with the ground truth, inferred CNN-based segmentations can lack coherence, including spurious connected components, holes and voids. Such results are implausible, violating anticipated anatomical topology. In response, (single-class) persistent homology-based loss functions have been proposed to capture global anatomical features. Our work extends these approaches to the task of multi-class segmentation. Building an enriched topological description of all class labels and class label pairs, our loss functions make predictable and statistically significant improvements in segmentation topology using a CNN-based post-processing framework. We also present (and make available) a highly efficient implementation based on cubical complexes and parallel execution, enabling practical application within high resolution 3D data for the first time. We demonstrate our approach on 2D short axis and 3D whole heart CMR segmentation, advancing a detailed and faithful analysis of performance on two publicly available datasets.","Byrne, Nick; Clough, James R; Valverde, Isra; Montana, Giovanni; King, Andrew P",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.12689v1.pdf,8

405456,Attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines in Chinese college students,2021,"The rapid emergence and the disastrous impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic on public health, societies, and economies around the world has created an urgent need for understanding the pathways critical for virus transmission. Airborne virus transmission by asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals is considered to be a major contributor to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and social distancing and wearing of face masks in public have been implemented as countermeasures in many countries. However, a comprehensive risk assessment framework for the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 incorporating realistic assumptions on the filtration of infectious aerosols (IAs) by face masks is not available yet. In particular, in most end-to-end models for airborne virus transmission, it is neglected that the stochastic spread of IAs through imperfectly fitted face masks depends on the dynamics of the breathing of the wearer. In this paper, we consider airborne virus transmission from an infected but asymptomatic person to a healthy person, both wearing imperfectly fitted face masks, in an indoor environment. By framing the end-to-end virus transmission as a Molecular Communications (MC) system, we obtain a statistical description of the number of IAs inhaled by the healthy person subject to the respective configurations of the face masks of both persons. We demonstrate that the exhalation and inhalation air flow dynamics have a significant impact on the stochastic filtering of IAs by the face masks. Furthermore, we show that the fit of the face mask of the infected person can highly impact the infection probability. We conclude that the proposed MC model may contribute a valuable assessment tool to fight the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as it encompasses the randomness of the transmission process and enables comprehensive risk analysis beyond statistical averages.","Lotter, Sebastian; Brand, Lukas; Schafer, Maximilian; Schober, Robert",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.12571v2.pdf,8

Methods: We conducted a primary survey of 521 adults on April 1-10, 2020 in Iran, where 3% reported being COVID-19 positive and 15% were unsure whether they were infected. This relatively high positive rate enabled us to conduct the analysis at the 5% significance level. Results: Adults who exercised more were more likely to be COVID-19 negative. Each additional hour of exercise per day predicted a 78% increase in the likelihood of being COVID-19 negative. Adults with chronic health issues were 48% more likely to be COVID-19 negative. Those working from home were the most likely to be COVID-19 negative, and those who had stopped working due to the pandemic were the most likely to be COVID-19 positive. Adults employed in larger organizations were less likely to be COVID-19 positive. Conclusion: This study enables more targeted infectious disease prevention and control by identifying the risk factors of COVID-19 infections from a set of readily accessible information. We hope this research opens a new research avenue to predict the individual likelihood of COVID-19 infection by risk factors.","Zhang, Stephen X; Sun, Shuhua; Afshar Jahanshahi, Asghar; Wang, Yifei; Nazarian Madavani, Abbas; Li, Jizhen; Mokhtari Dinani, Maryam",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,,8

While these measures were crucial to stop the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2, numerous voices highlighted their disorderly psychological, social, and economic impacts on food consumption behavior and lifestyle. Therefore, this paper aims to understand how consumers' food-related habits in Russia have shifted due to the COVID-19 pandemic and potential problems and opportunities this might bring for the Russian food system. The study is based on an online cross-sectional survey using a structured questionnaire administered in Russian through the Survey Monkey platform. A total of 1297 valid answers was collected. The results reveal that diet and food shopping, preparation, and use have been widely affected. Indeed, the survey results suggested (i) a change in the modality of acquiring food, consumers reduced the number of shopping trips and buying more on each trip to minimize store visits; (ii) a surge of stockpiling of non-perishable food items; (iii) a shift toward healthier diets; (iv) an increase in culinary capabilities; (v) a decrease of food waste. The results are expected to inform current emergency plans as well as long-term food-related strategies in Russia.","Ben Hassen, Tarek; El Bilali, Hamid; Allahyari, Mohammad S; Berjan, Sinisa; Fotina, Oksana",Appetite,,8

Strategies to mitigate the risk of potential aerosol-generating procedures(AGPs) have been promoted at a feverish pace, and significant effort has been made to optimize guidelines limitingaerosolization. This review summarizes the use of topical therapies as a perioperative infection control strategy, detailingefficacy, safety, and delivery options. Methods: A PubMed/MEDLINE and Scopus database review of articles was conducted querying topical therapies, includingpovidone-iodine (PVP-I), chlorhexidine, saline, surfactants, alcohols, and interferon activity against coronaviruses, andsafety for peri-operative use. Results: Few clinical studies specifically investigate the in vivo viricidal activity of topical agents against SARS-CoV-2 in theperioperative setting. Of topical agents with viricidal potential, PVP-I is supported by the most robust investigations-invitro studies have shown that PVP-I solutions as low as 0.5% can completely inactivate SARS-CoV-2 with 15 seconds ofcontact time, and solutions as low as 0.23% may neutralize SARS-CoV-2 homologues. Regarding safety, PVP-Iconcentrations of 2.5% and greater are associated with ciliotoxicity effects on human respiratory epithelial cells, but can betolerated up to 5% when administered intraorally, and up to 1% as a sinus irrigation formulation. As for other agents,preliminary studies show that chlorhexidine mouthwash may transiently decrease the SARS-CoV-2 virus load below thedetectable limit in saliva for 2 to 4 hours, but in isolation it is less effective than PVP-I in vitro studies. Furthermore,chlorhexidine and other antiseptics including ethanol have a worse safety profile than PVP-I, including increasedflammability and ototoxicity. Studies also show that hypertonic saline nasal irrigation and gargling leads to decreasedduration of illness, transmission, and viral shedding among patients with the common cold, including coronaviruses, andwas well tolerated barring some reports of nasal irritation, epistaxis, and headache. Conclusions: Several topical therapies, including PVP-I and hypertonic saline, may be at least temporarily effective atinactivating SARS-CoV-2 in the perioperative setting. However, these interventions are not without potential risks, includingciliotoxicity, which adversely impacts the mucociliary clearance of pathogens, and the efficacy of these agents is limited byavailable clinical data. However, thoughtful, evidence-based approaches should be considered as a sustainable option toreduce the risk of respiratory viral particle aerosolization in AGPs, such as endonasal skull base surgery.","Tai, K.; Mady, L.

Nevertheless, there is a signal of potentially increased vulnerability of patients with cancer to more COVID-19induced mortality, this notion needs to be further evaluated in various societies with different cancer epidemiology and practice. Objectives: To investigate the outcomes of cancer patients admitted due to COVID-19 and compare them with data of COVID-19 infected patients without a history of cancer. Methods: In this case-control study, the medical records of patients with cancer (Ca+ patients) who infected with COVID-19 were evaluated and compared with patients without a medical history of cancer (Ca- patients). Clinical data were collected from 19 February 2020 to 17 May 2020. The extracted data were classified into demographics, underlying medical conditions, clinical manifestations, imaging and laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes. Results: A total of 24 Ca+ patients were compared with 44 Ca- patients in terms of clinical manifestations and outcomes of COVID19. The Ca- patients significantly developed more dry cough (75.0% vs 29.2%, P = 0.01) and fever (72.7% vs 45.8%, P = 0.02). Findings of the chest CT scan was comparable between groups, except for pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy that exclusively reported in Ca+ patients. (3% and 4%, respectively). At the end of observation, 13 (19.1%) patients died from COVID-19. This rate was significantly higher in Ca+ patients (41.7 vs 6.8%, P = 001). Likewise, Ca+ patients experienced more mechanical ventilation (25.0 vs 4.7%, P = 0.01). However, the rate of ICU admission was comparable between groups (P = 0.29).

410149,A rapid screening classifier for diagnosing COVID-19,2021,"This article titled ""The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Croatian economy"" deals with exceedingly current events triggered by the pandemic, which have reflected on the national and global economy. Based on the currently available data and the survey of 358 respondents (from both the private entrepreneurship sector and public administration), the effect of COVID-19 on the Croatian economy is observed through declining employment, the required recovery years, and declining GDP. The differences and similarities between this and the great global economic crisis of 2008/2009 as well as the opinion of entrepreneurs on which crisis has had more significant consequences for the economy were examined. A linear regression model predicts the declining employment in the recovery years. The entrepreneurs agree that the crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is far more destructive and devastating to the economy, primarily because there is no end in sight even though the vaccine has been found. The unanimous agreement of the entrepreneurs is that, without further measures aimed at preserving the economy put in place by the Government, it will not be possible to suppress a further decline in employment and GDP, which will lead to a prolongation of the necessary recovery time for the Croatian economy. This research is the basis for further research on the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Croatian economy.","Roska, V.; Buneta, A.; Papic, M.",Zbornik Veleucilista U Rijeci-Journal of the Polytechnics of Rijeka,,8

Naturally, automatic TKG completion has drawn much research interests for a more realistic modeling of relational reasoning. However, most of the existing mod-els for TKG completion extend static KG embeddings that donot fully exploit TKG structure, thus lacking in 1) account-ing for temporally relevant events already residing in the lo-cal neighborhood of a query, and 2) path-based inference that facilitates multi-hop reasoning and better interpretability. In this paper, we propose T-GAP, a novel model for TKG completion that maximally utilizes both temporal information and graph structure in its encoder and decoder. T-GAP encodes query-specific substructure of TKG by focusing on the temporal displacement between each event and the query times-tamp, and performs path-based inference by propagating attention through the graph. Our empirical experiments demonstrate that T-GAP not only achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art baselines, but also competently generalizes to queries with unseen timestamps. Through extensive qualitative analyses, we also show that T-GAP enjoys from transparent interpretability, and follows human intuition in its reasoning process.","Jung, Jaehun; Jung, Jinhong; Kang, U",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.10595v1.pdf,8

Ozone has been very low during winter haze (particulate) pollution episodes. However, the abrupt decrease of NOx emissions following the COVID-19 lockdown in January 2020 reveals a switch to fast ozone production during winter haze episodes with maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) ozone concentrations of 60 to 70 parts per billion. We reproduce this switch with the GEOS-Chem model, where the fast production of ozone is driven by HOx radicals from photolysis of formaldehyde, overcoming radical titration from the decreased NOx emissions. Formaldehyde is produced by oxidation of reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which have very high emissions in the North China Plain. This remarkable switch to an ozone-producing regime in January-February following the lockdown illustrates a more general tendency from 2013 to 2019 of increasing winter-spring ozone in the North China Plain and increasing association of high ozone with winter haze events, as pollution control efforts have targeted NOx emissions (30% decrease) while VOC emissions have remained constant. Decreasing VOC emissions would avoid further spreading of severe ozone pollution events into the winter-spring season.","Li, Ke; Jacob, Daniel J; Liao, Hong; Qiu, Yulu; Shen, Lu; Zhai, Shixian; Bates, Kelvin H; Sulprizio, Melissa P; Song, Shaojie; Lu, Xiao; Zhang, Qiang; Zheng, Bo; Zhang, Yuli; Zhang, Jinqiang; Lee, Hyun Chul; Kuk, Su Keun",Proc.

413598,Propensity score-matched comparison between open and minimal invasive hybrid esophagectomy for esophageal adenocarcinoma,2020,"Background: The outbreak of highly contagious coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has posed a serious threat to human life and health, especially for those with underlying diseases. However, the impact of COVID-19 epidemic on hemodialysis (HD) centers and HD patients has not been reported. Methods: We reviewed the whole course of the COVID-19 in the HD center of Renmin Hospital, Wuhan University (from January 14, 2020, to March 12, 2020). We compared the clinical manifestation and immune profiles among different patient groups with healthy individuals. Results: Forty-two of 230 HD patients (18.26%) and 4 of 33 medical staff (12.12%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period. Fifteen HD patients (6.52%), including 10 COVID-19 diagnosed, died. Only 2 deaths of the COVID-19 HD patients were associated with pneumonia/lung failure, others were ascribed to cardiovascular/cerebrovascular diseases or hyperkalemia. Except for 3 patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit for a severe condition (8.11%), including 2 who died, most COVID-19 diagnosed patients presented mild or nonrespiratory symptoms. The flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood showed that multiple lymphocyte populations in HD patients were significantly decreased. HD patients with COVID-19 even displayed more remarkable reduction of serum inflammatory cytokines than other patients with COVID-19. Conclusions: Compared with the general population, HD patients and health care professionals are the highly susceptible population and HD centers are high-risk areas during the outbreak. Most HD patients with COVID-19 exhibited mild clinical symptoms and did not progress to severe pneumonia, likely due to the impaired cellular immune function and incapability of mounting cytokine storm. More attention should be paid to prevent cardiovascular events, which may be the collateral impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic on HD patients.","Ma, Yiqiong; Diao, Bo; Lv, Xifeng; Zhu, Jili; Chen, Cheng; Liu, Lei; Zhang, Sihao; Shen, Bo; Wang, Huiming",Kidney Intl.

Data were derived from monthly samples in Casamento Lake (northern Patos Lagoon; Nov. 2002 to Apr. 2004) and Guaíba Lake (Jun. 2005 to May 2006). The reproductive period was determined according to the monthly variation of the gonadosomatic index (GSI). Fish reproduction was identified during all months of the year. Oligosarcus jenynsii started reproduction in winter, but extended spawning to spring (early warming-water reproduction). Three species also presented reproduction during warming water months, but beginning in spring and finishing in summer (late warm-water reproduction): P. nigribarbis, T. lucenai and P. bonariensis. Three species presented relatively short reproduction periods on summer (spotted warm-water reproduction): H. malabaricus, H. littorale and L. anus, and only one species reproduces almost continuously during warmer waters (long-season warm-water reproduction): A. fasciatus. Finally, two other species presented a very distinct reproductive pattern, starting reproduction on late summer but increasing GSI values along autumn and winter (long-season cooling-water reproducers): C. voga and O. robustus.(AU)","Fontoura, Nelson Ferreira; Ceni, Gianfranco; Braun, Aloisio Sirangelo; Marques, Camilla da Silva",Neotrop. ichthyol,,8
414716,Go Viral with Compassion and Kindness,2020,"The steep climbing of victims caused by the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) throughout the planet is sparking an unprecedented effort to identify effective therapeutic regimens to tackle the pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is known to gain entry into various cell types through the binding of one of its surface proteins (spike) to the host Angiotensin Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). Thus, the spike-ACE2 interaction represents a major target for vaccines and antiviral drugs. We recently described a novel method to pharmacologically down-regulate the expression of target proteins at the post-translational level. This technology builds on computational advancements in the simulation of folding mechanisms to rationally block protein expression by targeting folding intermediates, hence hampering the folding process. Here, we report the all-atom simulation of the entire sequence of events underlying the folding pathway of ACE2. Our data reveal the existence of a folding intermediate showing druggable pockets hidden in the native conformation. Both pockets were targeted by a virtual screening repurposing campaign aimed at quickly identifying drugs capable to decrease the expression of ACE2. Importantly, among the different virtual hits, we identified mefloquine, a quinoline-derivative belonging to a class of antimalaria agents (e.g. chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine) recently described for their effects on ACE2 maturation. Thus, our results suggest that these drugs could act against SARS-CoV-2 by altering the folding pathway of its receptor ACE2.","Boldrini, Alberto; Terruzzi, Luca; Spagnolli, Giovanni; Astolfi, Andrea; Massignan, Tania; Lolli, Graziano; Barreca, Maria Letizia; Biasini, Emiliano; Faccioli, Pietro; Pieri, Lidia",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13493v1.pdf,8

This study aims to describe a psychological screening program developed at a large University Hospital in Milan, Italy, and assess the psychological outcomes of employees and associated factors. A survey was electronically conducted among hospital employees between July and October 2020. Sociodemographic data, information about COVID-19 experience and three scales assessing anxiety (STAI-Y1), depression (HAM-D) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PCL-5) were collected. A total of 308 employees (80% women; mean age 45.1 years) responded: 16% physicians, 68% other healthcare professionals, and 16% administrative staff. Employees reported moderate/severe symptoms of anxiety (23%), depression (53%), and post-traumatic stress disorder (40%). At multivariate logistic regression analysis, having suffered a loss for COVID-19 in the personal context was independently associated with higher risk of moderate/severe anxiety (OR = 2.40; 95% CI 1.16-4.98), being female was associated with higher risk of moderate/severe depression (OR = 2.82; 95% CI 1.43-5.59), and having had a family member affected by COVID-19 was associated with higher risk of moderate/severe post-traumatic stress disorder (OR = 2.75; 95% CI 1.01-7.48).

415683,Methylene Blue in Refractory Septic Shock,2020,"BACKGROUND: The distribution of resources during the COVID-19 pandemic has been politicized and contentious in the United States. Vulnerable populations, such as those living in poverty, experiencing homelessness, or who use drugs, are particularly susceptible to becoming infected with COVID-19 and often have limited access to protective supplies, such as masks and hand sanitizer. Our aim was to understand public opinion on increasing the allocation of COVID-19 prevention resources to vulnerable populations. METHODS: Data were from an online survey of 680 United States adults. Participants' opinions on the allocation of COVID-19 prevention resources to people with low income, experiencing homelessness, or who use drugs were assessed using a five-item Likert scale. We examined the prevalence of these opinions and their relationship to sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 beliefs, and drug-related experiences. RESULTS: Most participants supported increasing resources for individuals with low incomes (79.6%) and experiencing homelessness (74.6%), while a minority supported increasing resources for people who use drugs (33.5%). Politically conservative participants were less likely to support increasing resources for all three populations than those who were politically liberal. Skepticism about the severity of COVID-19 was also associated with less support for increasing resources across groups. DISCUSSION: Our results demonstrate that people who use drugs continue to be stigmatized in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in popular opinion not supporting people who use drugs with potentially lifesaving resources. Overcoming this stigma is essential to prevent COVID-19 among people who use drugs, a population which experiences elevated risk of COVID-19 infection.","Schneider, Kristin E; Wilson, Deborah; Dayton, Lauren; Goodell, Erin M Anderson; Latkin, Carl A",Int J Drug Policy,,8
416439,The Role of Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine in Immune Regulation and Diseases,2020,"Zoonotic diseases cause repeated outbreaks in humans globally. The majority of emerging infections in humans are zoonotic. COVID-19 is an ideal example of a recently identified emerging zoonotic disease, causing a global pandemic. Anthropogenic factors such as modernisation of agriculture and livestock farming, wildlife hunting, the destruction of wild animal habitats, mixing wild and domestic animals, wildlife trading, changing food habits and urbanisation could drive the emergence of zoonotic diseases in humans. Since 2001, Bangladesh has been reporting many emerging zoonotic disease outbreaks such as nipah, highly pathogenic avian influenza, pandemic H1N1, and COVID-19. There are many other potential zoonotic pathogens such as Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, Kyasanur forest disease virus and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever that may emerge in the future. However, we have a limited understanding of zoonotic diseases' overall risk in humans and associated factors that drive the emergence of zoonotic pathogens. This narrative review summarised the major emerging, re-emerging, neglected and other potential zoonotic diseases in Bangladesh and their associated risk factors. Nipah virus and Bacillus anthracis caused repeated outbreaks in humans. More than 300 human cases with Nipah virus infection were reported since the first outbreak in 2001. The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) caused more than 550 outbreaks in poultry, and eight human cases were reported so far since 2007. People of Bangladesh are frequently exposed to zoonotic pathogens due to close interaction with domestic and peri-domestic animals. The rapidly changing intensified animal-human-ecosystem interfaces and risky practices increase the risk of zoonotic disease transmission. The narrative review's findings are useful to draw attention to the risk and emergence of zoonotic diseases to public health policymakers in Bangladesh and the application of one-health approach to address this public health threat.","Chowdhury, Sukanta; Aleem, Mohammad A; Khan, Md Shafiqul I; Hossain, Mohammad Enayet; Ghosh, Sumon; Rahman, Mohammed Z",Vet. med. sci,,8
416945,Pandemic and Persona,2020,"We investigate binding of linoleate and other potential ligands to the recently discovered fatty acid binding site in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, using docking and molecular dynamics simulations. Simulations suggest that linoleate and dexamethasone stabilize the locked spike conformation, thus reducing the opportunity for ACE2 interaction. In contrast, cholesterol may expose the receptor-binding domain by destabilizing the closed structure, preferentially binding to a different site in the hinge region of the open structure. We docked a library of FDA-approved drugs to the fatty acid site using an approach that reproduces the structure of the linoleate complex. Docking identifies steroids (including dexamethasone and vitaminâ D); retinoids (some known to be active in vitro, and vitaminâ A); and vitaminâ K as potential ligands that may stabilize the closed conformation. The SARS-CoV-2 spike fatty acid site may bind a diverse array of ligands, including dietary components, and therefore provides a promising target for therapeutics or prophylaxis.","Shoemark, Deborah K; Colenso, Charlotte K; Toelzer, Christine; Gupta, Kapil; Sessions, Richard B; Davidson, Andrew D; Berger, Imre; Schaffitzel, Christiane; Spencer, James; Mulholland, Adrian J",Angew. chem; int. ed. engl,,8

Even if there are still some doubts about videoconferencing psychotherapy (VCP), a lot of studies indicate that VCP can be feasible and clinically effective, in fact the online therapy is becoming increasingly popular, reducing distances even during the current pandemic. The aim of this study is to analyze the degree of satisfaction after using VCP in a sample of psychotherapists freely recruited through the publication on social media of a specially created questionnaire. The collected data were analyzed by performing descriptive statistics to show the qualitative and quantitative composition of the sample examined. A tree classification model was created to predict the liking of the remote therapeutic intervention based on the socio-demographic characteristics, previous experiences and aspects of psychotherapeutic orientation of the therapists recruited in the study. Through a decision tree that explains which variables are related to positive responses, the following characteristics were found to predict the degree of satisfaction of the psychotherapists in using the VCP: belonging to a specific age group;having previously used VCP;and belonging to a specific psychotherapeutic orientation. According to the results, the first two important characteristics of the psychotherapists to influence the satisfaction in their use of VCP (belonging to the specific age group 45-65 and having previously used VCP) are probably a matter that can be linked to the degree of professional maturity and experience. The innovation of this research is to highlights the real impact of the distance therapy on the main therapeutic models, concluding that to have a certain level of proficiency, according the own orientation, in the use of the VCP may influence the level of satisfaction of the psychotherapists.","Cioffi, V.; Cantone, D.; Guerriera, C.; Architravo, M.; Mosca, L.

Background: Myocardial injury caused by COVID-19 was previously reported in hospitalized patients. It is unknown if there is sustained cardiac involvement after patients' recovery from COVID-19. Methods: Twenty-six patients recovered from COVID-19 who reported cardiac symptoms and underwent CMR examinations were retrospectively included. CMR protocols consisted of conventional sequences (cine, T2-weighted imaging, and late gadolinium enhancement [LGE]) and quantitative mapping sequences (T1, T2, and extracellular volume [ECV] mapping). Edema ratio and LGE were assessed in post-COVID-19 patients. Cardiac function, native T1/T2, and ECV were quantitatively evaluated and compared with controls. Results: Fifteen patients (58%) had abnormal CMR findings on conventional CMR sequences: myocardial edema was found in 14 (54%) patients and LGE was found in 8 (31%) patients. Decreased right ventricle functional parameters including ejection fraction, cardiac index, and stroke volume/body surface area were found in patients with positive conventional CMR findings. Using quantitative mapping, global native T1, T2, and ECV were all found to be significantly elevated in patients with positive conventional CMR findings, compared with patients without positive findings and controls (median [interquartile range]: native T1 1,271 ms [1,243 to 1,298 ms] vs. 1,237 ms [1,216 to 1,262 ms] vs. 1,224 ms [1,217 to 1,245 ms]; mean ± SD: T2 42.7 ± 3.1 ms vs. 38.1 ms ± 2.4 vs. 39.1 ms ± 3.1; median [interquartile range]: 28.2% [24.8% to 36.2%] vs. 24.8% [23.1% to 25.4%] vs. 23.7% [22.2% to 25.2%]; p = 0.002; p < 0.001, and p = 0.002, respectively).

The seropositive cutoff value was set using a cohort of 294 anonymous serum specimens collected in 2018. The specificity was assessed using serum specimens collected from organ donors or influenza patients before 2020. Seropositive rate was determined among COVID-19 patients. Time-to-seropositivity and signal-to-cutoff (S/CO) ratio were compared between MBA and EIA. MBA had a specificity of 100% (93/93; 95% confidence interval (CI), 96-100%) for anti-NP IgG, 98.9% (92/93; 95% CI 94.2-100%) for anti-RBD IgG.

This paper considers these findings in the light of the literature on Jewish mortality and undertakes a re-analysis of the results alongside the additional data on Jewish deaths provided by the British Jewish communal statistics. It asks two questions: (1) To what extent is elevated British Jewish mortality from COVID-19 a result of the presence of long-standing vulnerability and ill health among Jews? (2) What role do strictly Orthodox Jews play in elevating coronavirus mortality levels among British Jews? The primary contribution of the paper is to explore, via analyses of alternative data sources, the ONS finding of elevated Jewish mortality from coronavirus, to explain why it is surprising, to test whether it is real and to eliminate certain explanations. Such process of elimination in itself will highlight other alternative explanations, but the paper falls short of decisively explaining the phenomenon of the elevated British Jewish mortality from coronavirus.

Using agent-based simulations, we analyze the outbreak process for different combinations of the spatial parameters (alignment strength and Peclet number) and epidemic parameters (infection-lifetime transmissibility and duration of the individual infectious period). We show that the emerging spatial features strongly affect the contagion process. The ordered homogeneous states greatly disfavor infection spreading, due to their limited mixing, only achieving large outbreaks for high values of the individual infectious duration. The disordered homogeneous states also present low contagion capabilities, requiring relatively high values of both epidemic parameters to reach significant spreading. Instead, the inhomogeneous ordered states display high outbreak levels for a broad range of parameters. The formation of bands and clusters in these states favor infection propagation through a combination of processes that develop inside and outside of these structures. Our results highlight the importance of self-organized spatiotemporal features in a variety of contagion processes that can describe epidemics or other propagation dynamics, thus suggesting new approaches for understanding, predicting, and controlling their spreading in a variety of self-organized biological systems, ranging from bacterial swarms to animal groups and human crowds.","Zhao, Yinong; Huepe, Cristi'an; Romanczuk, Pawel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.12618v2.pdf,8

427890,Cell Death in Coronavirus Infections: Uncovering Its Role during COVID-19,2021,"ABSTRACT Objective: to reflect on the relationships involving the older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic from the perspective of complexity, envisioning the path of hope. Method: this is a reflection based on the Theory of Complexity, according to Edgar Morin, and on articles addressing the new coronavirus. Results: the experiences during the pandemic showed economic, social, health, cultural, ethical, and moral difficulties in relation to the older adults. Facing the uncertainties of COVID-19 teaches about the attitude towards this inevitable involvement in the individual and collective life, as well as in the history of the country and the world - a problem aggravated by the fears of humanity. Therefore, adapting society and remodeling it with regard to relationships with the older adults can translate into success against the pandemic disease. This induces thought reform, reorganizing the understanding of the older adults, which currently involves scattered, disjoint, compartmentalized, and excluding thinking. This reform is broad, deep, paradigmatic, cultural, ethical, and moral, which strengthens the culture of aging, propagating and democratizing the poetry of living, allowing the older adults to know the beauty of emotions, and to discover their own truths through the masterpieces of their lives. However, this intention presupposes a metamorphosis of individualism, oppression, and exclusion, in whose context gerontological nursing is fundamental. Conclusion: the transformations experienced during the pandemic may be the prelude to changing relationships with the older adults, through multiple reforming and transforming processes that come together, by the strengthening of gerontological nursing. Perhaps the pandemic moment is the beginning of the path of hope for new times of Humanity's dignity.","Hammerschmidt, Karina Silveira de Almeida; Bonatelli, Lisiane Capanema Silva; Carvalho, Anderson Abreu de",Texto &amp; contexto enferm,,8

Radiology is an important complement to clinical and epidemiological features. OBJECTIVE: To establish the most common CXR patterns in children with COVID-19, evaluate interobserver correlation and to discuss the role of imaging techniques in the management of children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-four patients between 0 and 16 years of age with confirmed SARS-Cov-2 infection and CXR were selected. Two paediatric radiologists independently evaluated the images and assessed the type of abnormality, distribution and evolution when available. RESULTS: Median age was 79.8 months (ranging from 2 weeks to 16 years of age). Fever was the most common symptom (43.5 %). 90 % of CXR showed abnormalities. Peribronchial cuffing was the most common finding (86.3 %) followed by GGOs (50 %). In both cases central distribution was more common than peripheral. Consolidations accounted for 18.1 %. Normal CXR, pleural effusion, and altered cardiomediastinal contour were the least common. CONCLUSION: The vast majority of CXR showed abnormalities in children with COVID-19. However, findings are nonspecific. Interobserver correlation was good in describing consolidations, normal x-rays and GGOs. Imaging techniques have a role in the management of children with known or suspected COVID-19, especially in those with moderate or severe symptoms or with underlying risk factors.","Oterino Serrano, C; Alonso, E; Andrés, M; Buitrago, N M; Pérez Vigara, A; Parrón Pajares, M; Cuesta López, E; Garzón Moll, G; Martin Espin, I; Bueno Barriocanal, M; De Ceano-Vivas la Calle, M; Calvo Rey, C; Bret-Zurita, M",Eur J Radiol,,8

The purpose of this study is to evaluate differences in abdominal pelvic CT findings in the emergency department by COVID-19 test result. METHODS: This retrospective study identified patients tested by PCR for COVID-19 infection who underwent abdominal pelvic CT scan in the ED across an academic health system from March 15 to April 15, 2020. Radiology reports were reviewed for the presence of ground glass opacity in the lungs and acute abdominal pathology. A subset of patients with acute abdominal pathology were identified with inflammatory pathology in organs with high ACE2 receptor expression including bowel, pancreas, urinary bladder, and kidney. CT findings for COVID positive versus negative patients were compared with Chi-square test. RESULTS: 597 patients tested by PCR for COVID-19 infection underwent abdominal pelvic CT scan, 44% were COVID-19 positive. COVID-19 positive patients demonstrated significantly more ground glass opacity at the lung bases, 65.1%, (222/341) versus 12.4% (33/266), p < 0.001), and significantly less acute abdominal findings, 23.8% (81/341) versus 45.5% (121/266), p &#8804; 0.001). When abdominal pathology was present, COVID-19 positive patients had higher rate of inflammatory pathology 58% (47/81) versus 29.8% (36/121). CONCLUSIONS: In patients undergoing abdominopelvic CT from the ED, COVID-19 positive patients are more likely to have ground glass opacities at the lung bases and less likely to have acute abdominal pathology compared with COVID-19 negative patients. Further, COVID-19 positive patients are more likely to have inflammation of organs with high expression of ACE2 receptors than other types of acute abdominal pathology.","Funt, Stacey A; Cohen, Stuart L; Wang, Jason J; Sanelli, Pina C; Barish, Matthew A",Abdom. radiology (Internet),,8

436006,Decrease in Positivity Rate of Influenza Tests Coinciding With Outbreak of SARS-CoV-2: Data From a Southeastern Wisconsin Laboratory,2020,"In the past two decades, the world has faced several infectious disease outbreaks. Ebola, Influenza A (H1N1), SARS, MERS, and Zika virus have had a massive global impact in terms of economic disruption, the strain on local and global public health. Most recently, the global outbreak of novel coronavirus 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) that causes COVID-19 is a newly discovered virus from the coronavirus family in Wuhan city, China, known to be a great threat to the public health systems. As of 15 April 2020, The Johns Hopkins University estimated that the COVID-19 affected more than two million people, resulting in a death toll above 130,000 around the world. Infected people in Europe and America correspond about 40% and 30% of the total reported cases respectively. At this moment only few Asian countries have controlled the disease, but a second wave of new infections is expected. Predicting inhibitor and target to the COVID-19 is an urgent need to protect human from the disease. Therefore, a protocol to identify anti-COVID-19 candidate based on computer-aided drug design is urgently needed. Thousands of compounds including approved drugs and drugs in the clinical trial are available in the literature. In practice, experimental techniques can measure the time and space average properties but they cannot be captured the structural variation of the COVID-19 during the interaction of inhibitor. Computer simulation is particularly suitable to complement experiments to elucidate conformational changes at the molecular level which are related to inhibition process of the COVID-19. Therefore, computational simulation is essential tool to elucidate the phenomenon. The structure-based virtual screening computational approach will be used to filter the best drugs from the literature, the investigate the structural variation of COVID-19 with the interaction of the best inhibitor is a fundamental step to design new drugs and vaccines which can combat the coronavirus. This mini-review will address novel coronavirus structure, mechanism of action, and trial test of antiviral drugs in the lab and patients with COVID-19.","Boopathi, Subramanian; Poma, Adolfo B; Kolandaivel, Ponmalai",J Biomol Struct Dyn,,8

Il caso della Regione siciliana,2020,"Understanding antibody-based SARS-CoV-2 immunity is critical for overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic and informing vaccination strategies. We evaluated SARS-CoV-2 antibody dynamics over 10 months in 963 individuals who predominantly experienced mild COVID-19. Investigating 2,146 samples, we initially detected SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in 94.4% of individuals, with 82% and 79% exhibiting serum and IgG neutralization, respectively. Approximately 3% of individuals demonstrated exceptional SARS-CoV-2 neutralization, with these ""elite neutralizers"" also possessing SARS-CoV-1 cross-neutralizing IgG. Multivariate statistical modeling revealed age, symptomatic infection, disease severity, and gender as key factors predicting SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing activity. A loss of reactivity to the virus spike protein was observed in 13% of individuals 10 months after infection. Neutralizing activity had half-lives of 14.7 weeks in serum versus 31.4 weeks in purified IgG, indicating a rather long-term IgG antibody response. Our results demonstrate a broad spectrum in the initial SARS-CoV-2-neutralizing antibody response, with sustained antibodies in most individuals for 10 months after mild COVID-19.","Vanshylla, Kanika; Di Cristanziano, Veronica; Kleipass, Franziska; Dewald, Felix; Schommers, Philipp; Gieselmann, Lutz; Gruell, Henning; Schlotz, Maike; Ercanoglu, Meryem S; Stumpf, Ricarda; Mayer, Petra; Zehner, Matthias; Heger, Eva; Johannis, Wibke; Horn, Carola; Suárez, Isabelle; Jung, Norma; Salomon, Susanne; Eberhardt, Kirsten Alexandra; Gathof, Birgit; Fätkenheuer, Gerd; Pfeifer, Nico; Eggeling, Ralf; Augustin, Max; Lehmann, Clara; Klein, Florian",Cell Host Microbe,,8

441188,Perspectives on viscoelastic flow instabilities and elastic turbulence,2021-08-22,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Physician training and onsite proctoring are critical for safely introducing new biomedical devices, a process that has been disrupted by the pandemic. A teleproctoring concept using optical see-through head-mounted displays with a proctor's ability to see and, more important, virtually interact in the operator's visual field is presented. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Test conditions were created for simulated proctoring using a bifurcation aneurysm flow model for WEB device deployment. The operator in the angiography suite wore a Magic Leap-1 optical see-through head-mounted display to livestream his or her FOV to a proctor's computer in an adjacent building. A Web-based application (Spatial) was used for the proctor to virtually interact in the operator's visual space. Tested elements included the quality of the livestream, communication, and the proctor's ability to interact in the operator's environment using mixed reality. A hotspot and a Wi-Fi-based network were tested. RESULTS: The operator successfully livestreamed the angiography room environment and his FOV of the monitor to the remotely located proctor. The proctor communicated and guided the operator through the procedure over the optical see-through head-mounted displays, a process that was repeated several times. The proctor used mixed reality and virtual space sharing to successfully project images, annotations, and data in the operator's FOV for highlighting any device or procedural aspects. The livestream latency was 0.71 (SD, 0.03) seconds for Wi-Fi and 0.86 (SD, 0.3) seconds for the hotspot (P = .02). The livestream quality was subjectively better over the Wi-Fi. CONCLUSIONS: New technologies using head-mounted displays and virtual space sharing could offer solutions applicable to remote proctoring in the neurointerventional space.","Rai, A T; Deib, G; Smith, D; Boo, S",AJNR am. j. neuroradiology,,8

441640,"Cervical lymph nodes, a diagnostic dilemma",2020,"This article focuses on the administration of courts in Israel during the Coronavirus Pandemic, and particularly on the emergency powers utilized by the Minister of Justice. The article points out that more attention must be granted to the confluence of two issues: emergency powers and court administration. While the literature on emergency powers has discussed at length the challenges inherent in maintaining the rule of law under extreme conditions, the literature on court administration has not shown as clear an awareness of the issue, even though it has extensively discussed the tensions intrinsic to executive control over court administration. This article points out, drawing on both of these theoretical discourses, that we must carefully structure emergency powers over the administration of courts taking care to maintain the realization of the principles of judicial independence and judicial accountability, which in emergencies necessitates a clear separation of the power to declare a state of emergency from the power to curtail court operations due to the emergency. Furthermore, we must also maintain transparency in the realization of these principles, which is almost as important as their actual realization in order to maintain public confidence in the courts. © 2021 The Author(s).

442246,Genomic Insights into Stillbirth,2020,"Purpose: The aim of this work was to study and document retinal changes in coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) positive patients with nonsevere disease using a nonmydriatic handheld fundus camera. Methods: A cross-sectional observational study was conducted on patients affected by COVID-19 who were admitted at our center. Our study included patients with no, mild, and moderate symptoms (nonsevere cases). Intensive care unit (ICU)-admitted patients were excluded considering the difficulty in procuring the fundus image by the handheld camera due to patients positioning. Patients with systemic conditions (diabetes, hypertension, and severe anemia) known to cause retinopathy were also excluded. Bedside anterior segment examination, fundus examination using indirect ophthalmoscopy and fundus imaging of each patient using a nonmydriatic handheld fundus camera was done by a trained ophthalmologist posted for COVID duty. Results: In a cohort of 138 patients, 94 (68.1%) were men and 44 (31.9%) were women. A total of 276 eyes were evaluated. The mean age of the patients was 38.51 ± 14.4 years. Anterior segment evaluation showed no abnormality in any of the eyes. On fundus screening using nonmydriatic handheld camera, a single streak of superficial retinal hemorrhage was noted at the posterior pole of the fundus in the left eye of one patient (0.72%), which was away from fovea. Laboratory tests revealed low hemoglobin (between 10 and 10.9 g/dL falling under mild Anemia) in 12 patients, elevated total leucocyte count in 6 patients, raised LDH in majority of patients (323 ± 101 Units/L) and elevated CRP (14.6 ± 30.99 mg/L). Rest of the lab parameters were within the normal range.

As many countries around the world, Malaysia and other southeast Asian (SEA) countries have also enforced lockdown at different degrees to contain the spread of the disease, which has brought some positive effects on natural environment. Therefore, evaluating the reduction in anthropogenic emissions due to COVID-19 and the related governmental measures to restrict its expansion is crucial to assess its impacts on air pollution and economic growth. In this study, we used aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations from Himawari-8 satellite, along with tropospheric NO2 column density from Aura-OMI over SEA, and ground-based pollution measurements at several stations across Malaysia, in order to quantify the changes in aerosol and air pollutants associated with the general shutdown of anthropogenic and industrial activities due to COVID-19. The lockdown has led to a notable decrease in AOD over SEA and in the pollution outflow over the oceanic regions, while a significant decrease (27% - 30%) in tropospheric NO2 was observed over areas not affected by seasonal biomass burning. Especially in Malaysia, PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, and CO concentrations have been decreased by 26-31%, 23-32%, 63-64%, 9-20%, and 25-31%, respectively, in the urban areas during the lockdown phase, compared to the same periods in 2018 and 2019. Notable reductions are also seen at industrial, suburban and rural sites across the country. Quantifying the reductions in major and health harmful air pollutants is crucial for health-related research and for air-quality and climate-change studies.","Kanniah, Kasturi Devi; Kamarul Zaman, Nurul Amalin Fatihah; Kaskaoutis, Dimitris G; Latif, Mohd Talib",Sci Total Environ,,8

Little is known about long-term consequences of COVID-19 on health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) and functional status in older people, and the impact of age in this context. We aimed to study age-related change in health-related quality of life, functional decline and mortality among older patients 6 months following hospitalisation due to COVID-19. METHODS: This was a cohort study including patients aged 60 years and older admitted to four general hospitals in South-Eastern Norway due to COVID-19, from March 1 up until July 1, 2020. Patients who were still alive were invited to attend a six-month follow-up. Change in HR-QoL and functional status compared to before the COVID-19 hospitalisation were assessed using the EuroQol 5-dimensional-5 levels questionnaire (EQ. 5D-5L). A change in visual analogue scale (VAS) score of 7 or more was considered clinically relevant. RESULTS: Out of 216 patients aged 60 years and older that were admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 during the study period, 171 were still alive 180 days after hospital admission, and 106 patients (62%) attended the six-month follow-up. Mean age was 74.3 years, 27 patients (26%) had experienced severe COVID-19. Fifty-seven participants (54%) reported a decrease in the EQ. 5D-5L VAS score after 6 months, with no significant difference between persons aged 75 years and older compared to younger. Seventy participants (66%) reported a negative change in any of the dimensions of the EQ. 5D-5L, with impaired ability to perform activities of daily life (35%), reduced mobility (33%) and having more pain or discomfort (33%) being the most commonly reported changes. Forty-six participants (43%) reported a negative change in cognitive function compared to before the COVID-19 hospitalisation. Six-month mortality was 21%, and increased with increasing age. CONCLUSIONS: More than half of the patients reported a negative change in HR-QoL 6 months following hospitalisation due to COVID-19, and one out of three experienced a persistently impaired mobility and ability to carry out activities of daily living. The results suggest awareness of long-term functional decline in older COVID-19 patients.","Walle-Hansen, M M; Ranhoff, A H; Mellingsæter, M; Wang-Hansen, M S; Myrstad, M",BMC Geriatr,,8
443210,Demystifying Excess Immune Response in COVID-19 to Reposition an Orphan Drug for Down-Regulation of NF-κB: A Systematic Review,2021,"Objective: To determine the antibody levels (IgM and IgG), using ELISA in suspected patients of COVID-19. Study Design: Descriptive cross-sectional study. Place & Duration of Study: Real Time PCR Diagnostic and Research Laboratory, Peshawar, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan, from May to July 2020. Methodology: A total of 94 blood specimens were collected from suspected COVID-19 patients. The antibody levels (IgG and IgM) were determined, using a COVID-19 ELISA IgG and IgM kit. Results: Out of a total 94 serum specimens, specimens were predominantly collected from males (70.2%, n=66) as compared to females (29.8%, n=28). Amongst six different age groups, the majority of the samples were found in the 31-45 years, 16-30 years, and 46-60 years groups, 42.6% (n=40), 23.4% (n=22) and 22.3% (n=21), respectively. Of the 94 suspected COVID-19 patients' serum specimens, IgG and IgM were detected in 29.8% (n=28) and 39.4% (n=37), specimens, respectively. The IgG antibodies were detected more in males (60.0%, n=18) than females (40.0%, n=12) samples. Similarly, IgM antibodies were also found more frequently in males (61.1%, n=22) as compared to females (38.9%, n=14). Conclusion: Detection of antibodies in COVID-19 infected patients provides vital clinical information for clinicians and could be used for the identification of suspected cases. Moreover, males were more prone to disease compared to females, and the 31-45 years age group was also more affected.","Ali, S.; Muhammad, A.; Mehar, T.; Rehman, N.

443977,Achieving Influenza Vaccine Uptake Target in Canada via a Pharmacy-Led Telephone Discussion during the 2019-2020 Season,2021,"People with mental health and addiction issues are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 given the elevated risk of contracting COVID-19 within psychiatric facilities. The impact of the pandemic on this extraordinarily vulnerable population includes the potential for large outbreaks and multiple deaths. There is also the increased risk of serious psychological harm, exacerbating preexisting mental health and substance use issues and in turn elevating their risk to themselves and/or others. In Part I of this paper, we analyze the procedural barriers to access to justice that arose as a result of the initial responses to COVID-19 by the Consent and Capacity Board [CCB] and the Ontario Review Board [ORB]. In Part V, we include a brief report on how appeals taken from both tribunals have been handled throughout COVID-19 to date. In Part VI, we analyze the discretionary and systemic barriers experienced by people with mental health and addiction issues appearing before the CCB and ORB during COVID-19. We critique recent mental health law cases during COVID-19 where deprivations of liberty interests and substantive equality have occurred, and access to justice for people with mental health and addictions issues has been denied, suspended or impaired. Through a legal analysis of how the pandemic has impacted this vulnerable community of litigants, we hope this research will result in further advocacy and education to prevent outbreaks and death, improve health care practices, and increase access to justice.Alternate abstract:Les personnes qui ont des problèmes de santé mentale et de toxicomanie sont touchées de façon disproportionnée par la COVID-19, vu le risque élevé de contracter la COVID-19 dans les établissements psychiatriques. Les répercussions de la pandémie sur cette population extrêmement vulnérable comprennent la possibilité d'éclosions importantes et de décès multiples. Il y a également le risque accru de préjudice psychologique grave, qui exacerbe les problèmes de santé mentale et de toxicomanie préexistants et qui augmente les risques que les personnes souffrant de ces problèmes posent pour elles-mêmes ou pour d'autres personnes. Dans la partie I du présent document, nous analysons les obstacles procéduraux à l'accès à la justice qui sont apparus à la suite des réponses initiales à la COVID-19 par la Commission du consentement et de la capacité [CCC] et la Commission ontarienne d'examen [COE]. Dans la partie V, nous présentons un bref rapport sur la façon dont les appels interjetés à l'encontre des décisions des deux tribunaux ont jusqu'à présent été traités pendant la pandémie de COVID-19. Dans la partie VI, nous analysons les obstacles discrétionnaires et systémiques auxquels se heurtent les personnes ayant des problèmes de santé mentale et de toxicomanie qui comparaissent devant la CCC et la COE pendant la pandémie de COVID-19. Nous critiquons de récentes affaires en matière de santé mentale qui ont été instruites pendant la pandémie de COVID-19, dans lesquelles des privations de liberté et des dénis d'égalité réelle ont eu lieu et où l'accès à la justice pour les personnes ayant des problèmes de santé mentale et de toxicomanie a été refusé, suspendu ou compromis. Grâce à une analyse juridique des effets de la pandémie sur la communauté vulnérable de plaideurs qui nous intéresse, nous espérons que nos recherches mèneront à d'autres activités de sensibilisation et d'éducation visant à prévenir les éclosions et les décès, à améliorer les pratiques de soins de santé et à élargir l'accès à la justice.","Dhand, Ruby Szigeti Anita Kotob Maya Kennedy Michael Ye Rebecca",The Windsor Yearbook of Access to Justice = Recueil Annuel de Windsor d&#039;Accès à la Justice,,8

445340,A short review on important drugs under clinical trial against Covid-19,2020,"The innate immune response is critical for recognizing and controlling infections through the release of cytokines and chemokines. However, severe pathology during some infections, including SARS-CoV-2, is driven by hyperactive cytokine release, or a cytokine storm. The innate sensors that activate production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines during COVID-19 remain poorly characterized. In the present study, we show that both TLR2 and MYD88 expression were associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Mechanistically, TLR2 and Myd88 were required for ß-coronavirus-induced inflammatory responses, and TLR2-dependent signaling induced the production of proinflammatory cytokines during coronavirus infection independent of viral entry. TLR2 sensed the SARS-CoV-2 envelope protein as its ligand. In addition, blocking TLR2 signaling in vivo provided protection against the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Overall, our study provides a critical understanding of the molecular mechanism of ß-coronavirus sensing and inflammatory cytokine production, which opens new avenues for therapeutic strategies to counteract the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.","Zheng, Min; Karki, Rajendra; Williams, Evan Peter; Yang, Dong; Fitzpatrick, Elizabeth; Vogel, Peter; Jonsson, Colleen Beth; Kanneganti, Thirumala-Devi",Nat. immunol,,8

Here we describe our experience and assess the quality of an online training format based on participant outcomes for the first three modules of a planned series of online ART training. MATERIALS AND METHODS: These modules included manual semen analysis, sperm morphology and ancillary semen tests (testing for leukocytospermia, sperm vitality, and anti-sperm antibody screening). The virtual format consisted of lecture presentations featuring laboratory protocols with corresponding video demonstrations of routine techniques and best practices. Practical scenarios, troubleshooting, and clinical interpretation of laboratory results were also discussed. At the end of each module, an optional multiple choice question test was held as a prerequisite to obtain certification on the topics presented. Course quality was assessed using participant responses collected via online surveys. RESULTS: The digital delivery methods used were found to have largely or completely met the participants' expectations for all questions (>85%). The majority (>87%) of the participants either strongly agreed or agreed that the course content was well-structured with appropriate depth, and that their overall expectations of the course had been met. CONCLUSIONS: This training format appears to be a realistic teaching option to freely share highly specialized expertise and technical knowledge with participants from anywhere in the world with varying levels of competency or experience.","Agarwal, Ashok; Finelli, Renata; Durairajanayagam, Damayanthi; Leisegang, Kristian; Sharma, Rakesh; Gupta, Sajal; Singh, Neha; Belo, Andrea; Darbandi, Mahsa; Madani, Sarah; Covarrubias, Simryn; Darbandi, Sara; Sadeghi, Raha; Pompeu, Camila; Boitrelle, Florence; Kandil, Hussein; Saleh, Ramadan; Arafa, Mohamed; Vogiatzi, Paraskevi; Rosas, Israel Maldonado; Anagnostopoulou, Christina; Chockalingam, Annapoorani; Wirka, Kelly Athayde; Sallam, Hassan N; Shah, Rupin; Henkel, Ralf",,,8

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study to summarize the clinical practices of nonsevere patients with COVID-19 receiving the standard care, LPV/r or chloroquine in Beijing Ditan Hospital from January 20 to March 26, 2020. The main outcome measurements include the changes of cycle threshold values of open reading frame 1 ab (ORF1ab) and nucleocapsid (N) genes by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay from day 1 to 7 after admission for patients receiving standard care or after treatment being initiated for patients receiving either LPV/r or chloroquine. The proportion of developing severe illness, fever duration and the time from symptom onset to chest computer tomography improvement, and negative conversion of nucleic acid were compared. RESULTS: Of the 129 patients included in the study, 59 received the standard care, 51 received LPV/r, and 19 received chloroquine. The demographics and baseline characteristics were comparable among the 3 groups. The median duration of fever, median time from symptom onset to chest computer tomography improvement, and negative conversion of the nucleic acid were similar among the 3 groups. The median increase in cycle threshold values of N and ORF1ab gene for patients receiving LPV/r or chloroquine or the standard care during the treatment course was 7.0 and 8.5, 8.0, and 7.6, 5.0, and 4.0, respectively. These figures were not found significantly different among the 3 groups.

449937,In vitro evaluation of disposable transport ventilators with combination aerosol therapy,2021,"This guideline provides updated recommendations on the role of pre-procedure testing for SARS-CoV2 in individuals undergoing endoscopy in the post-vaccination period and replaces the prior guideline from the American Gastroenterological Association (released July 29, 2020). Since the start of the pandemic, our increased understanding of transmission has facilitated the implementation of practices to promote patient and healthcare worker (HCW) safety. Simultaneously, there has been increasing recognition of the potential harm associated with delays in patient care as well as inefficiency of endoscopy units. With widespread vaccination of HCWs and the general population, a re-evaluation of AGA's prior recommendations was warranted. In order to update the role of pre-procedure testing for SARS-CoV2, the AGA guideline panel reviewed the evidence on (1) prevalence of asymptomatic SARS-CoV2 infections in individuals undergoing endoscopy, (2) patient and HCW risk of infections that may be acquired immediately before, during, or after endoscopy, (3) effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine in reducing risk of infections and transmission, (4) patient and HCW anxiety, (5) patient delays in care and potential impact on cancer burden, and (6) endoscopy volumes. The panel considered the certainty of the evidence, weighed the benefits and harms of routine pre-procedure testing, and considered burden, equity, and cost using the GRADE framework. Based on very low certainty evidence, the panel made a conditional recommendation against routine pre-procedure testing for SARS-CoV2 in patients scheduled to undergo endoscopy. The panel placed a high value on minimizing additional delays in patient care, acknowledging the reduced endoscopy volumes, downstream impact on delayed cancer diagnoses and burden of testing on patients.","Sultan, Shahnaz; Siddique, Shazia M; Singh, Siddarth; Altayar, Osama; Caliendo, Angela M; Davitkov, Perica; Feuerstein, Joseph D; Kaul, Vivek; Lim, Joseph K; Mustafa, Reem A; Falck-Ytter, Yngve; Inadomi, John M",Gastroenterology,,8

451906,Recommended Papers of 2020 From the TMR Editorial Board,2020,"Aims We aimed to evaluate the combination of telemedicine consultation and routinely serological screening for resumingactivities in the endoscopy unit. Methods A single-center, cohort study (April/15 to May/22). Patients were screened via telemedicine consult by apulmonologist for a history of acute symptoms, close contacts, or exposure to COVID-19. Serological screening within 24-hours prior to endoscopic procedures was performed and combined with clinical interpretation. The endoscopy staff wasscreened for symptoms and COVID-19 infection via PCR-swab before and after the protocol instauration for resumingactivities. Social distancing on the preparation, endoscopy, and recovering room, as well as personal protective equipment, and an aerosol box shield for intubation in those cases requiring general anesthesia. Patients were follow-up up to 4-weeksand screened for COVID-19 symptoms. Results 127 patients were included in the study period. 9/127 exhibited positive IgM antibodies against COVID-19 (7/9patients had mild clinical presentation whereas 2/9 were asymptomatic). Their endoscopic procedures were differed until anegative PCR-swab test was obtained. 118 patients were submitted to endoscopic procedures following the protocol. Themedian age was 45 years, 64.4 % were female. The mean body temperature of 37 C. 13.6 % were hospitalized patients. Ofthe 118 patients treated, 53.4 % were for therapeutic procedures while 46.6 % were diagnostic. 85.6 % of the procedures were categorized as non-urgent whereas 14.4 % as urgent. The frequencies of the endoscopic procedures were describedas: Esophagogastroduodenoscopy 45.8 %, colonoscopy 2.5 %, ERCP 22.0 %, cholangioscopy 15.3 %, and endoscopicultrasound 14.4 %. Any nosocomial COVID-19 infection within the endoscopy staff and patients was reported during theprotocol and 1-month follow-up. Conclusions A combined telemedicine consultation following by a serological screening allows a safe resuming of activitiesin the endoscopy unit at a low cost. Social distancing during preparation and recovery room, as well as personal protectiveequipment, plays a role in managing the spreading of COVID-19.","Robles-Medranda, C.; Oleas, R.; Alcivar-Vasquez, J.; Puga-Tejada, M.; Sanchez, E.; Del Valle, R.; Cifuentes, C.; Alvarado, H.; Pitanga-Lukashok, H.",Endoscopy,,8
452153,Inflammation and Antiviral Immune Response Associated With Severe Progression of COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND: Unrest in Myanmar in August 2017 resulted in the movement of over 700,000 Rohingya refugees to overcrowded camps in Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh. A large outbreak of diphtheria subsequently began in this population. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Data were collected during mass vaccination campaigns (MVCs), contact tracing activities, and from 9 Diphtheria Treatment Centers (DTCs) operated by national and international organizations. These data were used to describe the epidemiological and clinical features and the control measures to prevent transmission, during the first 2 years of the outbreak. Between November 10, 2017 and November 9, 2019, 7,064 cases were reported: 285 (4.0%) laboratory-confirmed, 3,610 (51.1%) probable, and 3,169 (44.9%) suspected cases. The crude attack rate was 51.5 cases per 10,000 person-years, and epidemic doubling time was 4.4 days (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.2-4.7) during the exponential growth phase. The median age was 10 years (range 0-85), and 3,126 (44.3%) were male. The typical symptoms were sore throat (93.5%), fever (86.0%), pseudomembrane (34.7%), and gross cervical lymphadenopathy (GCL; 30.6%). Diphtheria antitoxin (DAT) was administered to 1,062 (89.0%) out of 1,193 eligible patients, with adverse reactions following among 229 (21.6%). There were 45 deaths (case fatality ratio [CFR] 0.6%). Household contacts for 5,702 (80.7%) of 7,064 cases were successfully traced. A total of 41,452 contacts were identified, of whom 40,364 (97.4%) consented to begin chemoprophylaxis; adherence was 55.0% (N = 22,218) at 3-day follow-up. Unvaccinated household contacts were vaccinated with 3 doses (with 4-week interval), while a booster dose was administered if the primary vaccination schedule had been completed. The proportion of contacts vaccinated was 64.7% overall. Three MVC rounds were conducted, with administrative coverage varying between 88.5% and 110.4%. Pentavalent vaccine was administered to those aged 6 weeks to 6 years, while tetanus and diphtheria (Td) vaccine was administered to those aged 7 years and older. Lack of adequate diagnostic capacity to confirm cases was the main limitation, with a majority of cases unconfirmed and the proportion of true diphtheria cases unknown. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the largest reported diphtheria outbreak in refugee settings. We observed that high population density, poor living conditions, and fast growth rate were associated with explosive expansion of the outbreak during the initial exponential growth phase. Three rounds of mass vaccinations targeting those aged 6 weeks to 14 years were associated with only modestly reduced transmission, and additional public health measures were necessary to end the outbreak. This outbreak has a long-lasting tail, with Rt oscillating at around 1 for an extended period. An adequate global DAT stockpile needs to be maintained. All populations must have access to health services and routine vaccination, and this access must be maintained during humanitarian crises.","Polonsky, Jonathan A; Ivey, Melissa; Mazhar, Md Khadimul Anam; Rahman, Ziaur; le Polain de Waroux, Olivier; Karo, Basel; Jalava, Katri; Vong, Sirenda; Baidjoe, Amrish; Diaz, Janet; Finger, Flavio; Habib, Zakir H; Halder, Charls Erik; Haskew, Christopher; Kaiser, Laurent; Khan, Ali S; Sangal, Lucky; Shirin, Tahmina; Zaki, Quazi Ahmed; Salam, Md Abdus; White, Kate",PLoS Med,,8

The authors assumed the consumption of foods containing salmiak (NH4Cl) was a common and peculiar cause of the reduced COVID-19 related death rates in these countries, because NH4Cl is a known lysosomotropic agent, which has been indicated to inhibit or prevent SARS-CoV infection. To check the possible effectiveness of salmiak consumption against COVID-19 related death, the authors used a linear regression model with the death rate as the dependent variable and BCG-policy and salmiak consumption score as independent variables.RESULTSUsing least squares regression and a robust standard error algorithm, the authors found a significant effect exerted by the independent variables (P &lt; 0.0005 for BCG and P = 0.001 for salmiak). Salmiak score alone was significant (P = 0.016) when using least squares regression with robust error algorithm.CONCLUSIONSThe results seem to confirm an association between BCG-positive vaccination policy and salmiak consumption, and lower death rates from COVID-19. Implementing BCG vaccination policy and fortification of foods with salmiak (NH4Cl) may have a significant impact on the control of SARS-CoV epidemic.","Hidvégi, Máté Nichelatti Michele",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,,8

To address this issue, we performed a meta-analysis of the published literature on household SARS-CoV-2 transmission clusters (n=213 from 12 countries). Only 8 (3.8%) transmission clusters were identified as having a paediatric index case. Asymptomatic index cases were associated with a lower secondary attack in contacts than symptomatic index cases (estimate risk ratio [RR], 0.17; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.09-0.29). To determine the susceptibility of children to household infections the secondary attack rate (SAR) in paediatric household contacts was assessed. The secondary attack rate in paediatric household contacts was lower than in adult household contacts (RR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.42-0.91).

455322,Authors' response,2020,"Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) was first isolated in Australia in 1962. Ongoing surveillance and characterization of Australian IBVs have shown that they have evolved separately from strains found throughout the rest of the world, resulting in the evolution of a range of unique strains and changes in the dominant wild-type strains, affecting tissue tropism, pathogenicity, antigenicity, and gene arrangement. Between 1961 and 1976 highly nephropathogenic genotype GI-5 and GI-6 strains, causing mortalities of 40% to 100%, predominated, while strains causing mainly respiratory disease, with lower mortality rates, have predominated since then. Since 1988, viruses belonging to two distinct and novel genotypes, GIII and GV, have been detected. The genome organization of the GIII strains has not been seen in any other gammacoronavirus. Mutations that emerged soon after the introduction of vaccination, incursion of strains with a novel lineage from unknown sources, recombination between IBVs from different genetic lineages, and gene translocations and deletions have contributed to an increasingly complex IBV population. These processes and the consequences of this variation for the biology of these viruses provide an insight into the evolution of endemic coronaviruses during their control by vaccination and may provide a better understanding of the potential for evolution of other coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, the continuing capacity of attenuated IBV vaccines developed over 40 years ago to provide protection against viruses in the same genetic lineage provides some assurance that coronavirus vaccines developed to control other coronaviruses may continue to be effective for an extended period.","Quinteros, José A; Ignjatovic, Jagoda; Chousalkar, Kapil K; Noormohammadi, Amir H; Browning, Glenn F",Avian Pathol,,8

Here, we derive human brain organoids with innately developing microglia to investigate the cellular responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection on a single cell level. We find evidence of limited tropism to SARS-CoV-2 for all major cell types and observe extensive neuronal cell death that also include non-infected cells. Single cell transcriptome profiling reveals distinct responses in microglia and astrocytes that share features with cellular states observed in neurodegenerative diseases, includes upregulation of genes with relevance for synaptic stripping, and suggests altered blood brain barrier integrity. Across all cell types, we observe a global translational shut-down as well as altered carbohydrate metabolism and cellular respiration. Together, our findings provide insights into cellular responses of the resident brain immune cells to SARS-CoV-2 and pinpoint mechanisms that may be of relevance for the neuropathological changes observed in COVID-19 patients.","Samudyata,; Oliveira, Ana Osorio; Malwade, Susmita; Sousa, Nuno Rufino de; Goparaju, Sravan K; Orhan, Funda; Steponaviciute, Laura; Sheridan, Steven D; Perlis, Roy H; Rothfuchs, Antonio Gigliotti; Sellgren-Majkowitz, Carl",,,8

Radiologic imaging studies of the sinonasal tract and mastoid cavity in patients with COVID-19 infection are sparse and limited to case series. In this report, we investigate the radiologic involvement of nasal cavity, nasopharynx, paranasal sinuses, and mastoid cavity in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection who presented with acute neurological symptoms. METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records and neuroradiologic imaging in patients diagnosed with acute COVID-19 infection who presented with acute neurological symptoms to assess radiologic prevalence of sinus and mastoid disease and its correlation to upper respiratory tract symptoms. RESULTS: Of the 55 patients, 23 (42%) had partial sinus opacification, with no evidence for complete sinus opacification. The ethmoid sinus was the most commonly affected (16/55 or 29%). An air fluid level was noted in 6/55 (11%) patients, most commonly in the maxillary sinus. Olfactory recess and mastoid opacification were uncommon. There was no evidence of bony destruction in any of the studies, Cough, nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and sore throat were not significantly associated with any radiological findings. CONCLUSION: In patients who present with acute neurological symptoms, COVID-19 infection is characterized by limited and mild mucosal disease within the sinuses, nasopharynx and mastoid cavity.

The study aimed to explore the prevalence and clinical presentations of COVID-19 in healthcare workers (HCWs) at the University Clinical Hospital (UCH) in Wroclaw with 1677 beds. The retrospective study was performed in 2020 using a self-derived structured questionnaire in a sample of HCWs who were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed using a PCR double gene test and consented to be enrolled into the study. The significance level for all statistical tests was set to 0.05. The study showed that of the 4998 hospital workers, among 356 cases reported as COVID-19 infected, 70 consented to take part in the survey: nurses (48.5%), doctors (17.1%), HCWs with patient contact (10.0%), other HCWs without patient contact (7.1%), and cleaning personnel (5.7%). HCWs reported concurrent diseases such as hypertension (17.1%), bronchial asthma (5.7%), and diabetes (5.7%). Failure to keep 2 m distancing during contact (65.5%) and close contact with the infected person 14 days before the onset of symptoms or collection of biological material (58.6%) were identified as the increased risks of infection. A large part of infections in hospital healthcare staff were symptomatic (42.9%). The first symptoms of COVID-19 were general weakness (42.9%), poor mental condition (41.4%), and muscle pain (32.9%); whereas in the later stages of the illness, general weakness (38.6%), coughing (34.3%), lack of appetite (31.4%), and loss of taste (31.4%) were observed. In about 30% of the infected HCWs, there was no COVID-19 symptoms whatsoever. The vast majority of the patients were treated at home (85.7%). In conclusion, the majority of the SARS-CoV-2 infections in the hospital HCWs were asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. Therefore, successful limitation of COVID-19 infection spread at hospitals requires a close attention to future cross-infections.","Drobnik, Jaroslaw; Suslo, Robert; Pobrotyn, Piotr; Fabich, Ewa; Magiera, Violetta; Diakowska, Dorota; Uchmanowicz, Izabella",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,8

In the systems in which the interaction proceeds along the potential gradient (positive work), the re-sultant potential energy is found based on the principle of adding reciprocals of corresponding values of subsystems. This is the corpuscular process, in which entropy can serve as the theoreti-cal concept. In the systems in which the interactions proceed against the potential gradient (nega-tive work) the algebraic addition of their masses, as well as the corresponding energies of subsys-tems is performed. This is the wave process, in which negentropy can serve as the theoretical con-cept. The resonance stationary state of the systems is fulfilled under the condition of equality of degrees of their corpuscular and wave interactions. The entropy products in stationary state are completely compensated by the negentropy flow. Mathematically and graphically (by nomo-grams) the stationary state in microsystems is found by the following equation containing the tangent of the geodesic angel. The geodesic angle numerically defines the ratio of two legs of the right triangle whose values characterize energy dependencies through axial and circumferential stresses in the system with corpuscular-wave processes. This condition corresponds to the most optimal technological options and is widely present in nature, as well as in fractal systems. The initial nomograms of entropic and negentropic characteristics for many processes and phenome-na in nature, engineering and physical chemistry are given. The entopic technique for forming fractal systems is presented. The coronavirus scenario in Russia is analyzed.

466004,Causal Genetic Variants in Stillbirth,2020,"COVID-19 is highly transmissible and containing outbreaks requires a rapid and effective response. Because infection may be spread by people who are pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic, substantial undetected transmission is likely to occur before clinical cases are diagnosed. Thus, when outbreaks occur there is a need to anticipate which populations and locations are at heightened risk of exposure. In this work, we evaluate the utility of aggregate human mobility data for estimating the geographic distribution of transmission risk. We present a simple procedure for producing spatial transmission risk assessments from near-real-time population mobility data. We validate our estimates against three well-documented COVID-19 outbreak scenarios in Australia. Two of these were well-defined transmission clusters and one was a community transmission scenario. Our results indicate that mobility data can be a good predictor of geographic patterns of exposure risk from transmission centres, particularly in scenarios involving workplaces or other environments associated with habitual travel patterns. For community transmission scenarios, our results demonstrate that mobility data adds the most value to risk predictions when case counts are low and spatially clustered. Our method could assist health systems in the allocation of testing resources, and potentially guide the implementation of geographically-targeted restrictions on movement and social interaction.","Zachreson, Cameron; Mitchell, Lewis; Lydeamore, Michael; Rebuli, Nicolas; Tomko, Martin; Geard, Nicholas",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.06193v1.pdf,8

We collected clinical and epidemiologic data in an almost complete cohort of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals from Regensburg, Germany, from March 2020 to May 2020. METHODS: Analysis of a retrospectively documented cohort of consecutive COVID-19 cases recorded between March 7, 2020 and May 24, 2020 as part of an infection control investigation program, with prospective follow-up interviews gathering information on type and duration of symptoms and COVID-19 risk factors until June 26, 2020. RESULTS: Of 1089 total cases, 1084 (99.5%) cases were included. The incidence during the time period was 315.4/100,000, lower than in the superordinate government district Oberpfalz (468.5/100,000) and the overall state of Bavaria (359.7/100,000). The case fatality ratio (CFR) was 2.1%. Among fatal cases, the mean age was 74.4 years and 87% presented with known risk factors, most commonly chronic heart disease, chronic lung disease, kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus. 897 cases (82.7%) showed at least one symptom, most frequently cough (45%) and fever (41%). Further, 18% of cases suffered from odour/taste disorder. 17% of total cases reported no symptoms. The median duration of general illness was 10 days. During follow-up, 8.9% of 419 interviewed cases reported at least one symptom lasting at least 6 weeks, and fatigue was the most frequent persistent symptom. DISCUSSION: We report data on type and duration of symptoms, and clinical severity of nearly all (99.5%) patients with SARS-CoV-2 recorded from March 2020 to May 2020 in Regensburg. A broad range of symptoms and symptom duration was seen, some of them lasting several weeks in a considerable number of cases. The case-fatality ratio was 2.1%. Asymptomatic cases may be underrepresented due to the nature of the study.","Lampl, Benedikt M J; Buczovsky, Matthias; Martin, Gabriele; Schmied, Helen; Leitzmann, Michael; Salzberger, Bernd",Infection,,8

In this respect, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is comparable with other severe community-acquired forms of pneumonia caused by conventional pathogens, even if the pathogenesis is different. The fatality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients is approximately 20% (and therefore higher than for other pneumonia pathogens), in intensive care patients 30-40% and in invasively ventilated patients ca. 50%. Risk factors that are decisive for the fatality are old age, overweight, male gender and typical age-related cardiopulmonary underlying diseases.

474595,Editorial: Covid-19 Mechanisms on Cardio-Vascular Dysfunction: From Membrane Receptors to Immune Response,2021,"Since late December 2019, it has been reported an outbreak of atypical pneumonia, now known as COVID-19 caused by the novel coronavirus. Cases have spread to more than 200 countries and regions internationally. World Health Organization (WHO) officially declares the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic and the public health emergency has caused world-wide impact to daily lives: people are advised to keep social distance, in-person events have been moved online, and some function facilitates have been locked-down. Alternatively, the Web becomes an active venue for people to share information. With respect to the on-going topic, people continuously post questions online and seek for answers. Yet, sharing global information conveyed in different languages is challenging because the language barrier is intrinsically unfriendly to monolingual speakers. In this paper, we propose a multilingual COVID-QA model to answer people's questions in their own languages while the model is able to absorb knowledge from other languages. Another challenge is that in most cases, the information to share does not have parallel data in multiple languages. To this end, we propose a novel framework which incorporates (unsupervised) translation alignment to learn as pseudo-parallel data. Then we train multilingual question-answering mapping and generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach compared against a series of competitive baselines. In this way, we make it easier to share global information across the language barriers, and hopefully we contribute to the battle against COVID-19.

474613,COVID-19 and the neurological disease therapeutic pipeline,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cognitive decline and dementia are common in Parkinson's disease (PD). Cognitive deficits have been linked to the depletion of dopamine in the nigrostriatal pathway, but pharmacological treatments for PD have little evidence of improving or delaying cognitive decline. Therefore, exploring non-pharmacological treatment options is important. There have been some promising results of cognitive training interventions in PD, especially for improvements in working memory and executive functions. Yet, existing studies are often underpowered, lacking appropriate control condition, long term follow-up, a thorough description of the intervention and characteristics of the participants. Working memory updating training has previously shown to increase striatal activation in healthy young and old participants as well as dopaminergic neurotransmission in healthy young participants. In the light of dopamine dysfunction in PD, with negative effects on both motor and cognitive functions it is of interest to study if an impaired striatal system can be responsive to a non-invasive, non-pharmacological intervention. METHODS AND DESIGN: The iPARK trial is a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial with a parallel-group design that aims to recruit 80 patients with PD (during the period 02/2017-02/2023). Included patients need to have PD, Hoehn and Yahr staging I-III, be between 45 to 75 years of age and not have a diagnosis of dementia. All patients will undergo 30 sessions (6-8 weeks) of web-based cognitive training performed from home. The target intervention is a process-based training program targeting working memory updating. The placebo program is a low dose short-term memory program. A battery of neuropsychological tests and questionnaires will be performed before training, directly after training, and 16 weeks after training. DISCUSSION: We expect that the iPARK trial will provide novel and clinically useful information on whether updating training is an effective cognitive training paradigm in PD. Further, it will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of cognitive function in PD and provide answers regarding cognitive plasticity as well as determining critical factors for a responsive striatal system. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov registry number: NCT03680170 , registry name: ""Cognitive Training in Parkinson's Disease: the iPARK study"", retrospectively registered on the 21st of September 2018.

New therapeutic targets are urgently needed to provide better control of NO level during septic shock. In the present study, we investigated the role of HDAC6 in the regulation of NO production and nitrative stress in a mouse model of endotoxin-induced septic shock. HDAC6 deficient mice and a specific HDAC6 inhibitor were utilized in our studies. Our data clearly indicate that HDAC6 is an important mediator of NO production in macrophages. HDAC6 mediates NO production through the regulation of iNOS expression in macrophages. HDAC6 up-regulates iNOS expression in macrophages by modulating STAT1 activation and IRF-1 expression. HDAC6 inhibition potently blocked endotoxin-induced STAT1 activation and iNOS expression in macrophages. Furthermore, HDAC6 contributes to excessive NO production and nitrotyrosine level in the blood and promotes iNOS expression in the lung tissues during septic shock. Our data reveal a novel HDAC6/STAT1/iNOS pathway that mediates excessive NO production and nitrative stress in septic shock.","Wang, Yan; Wang, Ke; Fu, Jian",Front Immunol,,8

The well-known determiners of the immune response, such as X and Y chromosomes, sex hormones, and microbiota, are functionally interconnected and influence each other in shaping the organism's immunity. We focus our commentary on the interplay between the genetic sex and mitochondria and how this may affect a sex-dependent immune response in COVID-19 infection. Realizing the existence of these interactions may help in designing novel methods or fine-tuning the existing and routine therapies to fight COVID-19 and other infections.","Kloc, Malgorzata; Ghobrial, Rafik Mark; Kubiak, Jacek Z",Int Arch Allergy Immunol,,8

The articles address (1) The impact of COVID-19 in individuals with congenital heart disease through the life span. Patients with a genetic syndrome and adults at advanced physiological stage were at highest risk for moderate/severe infection. (2) Echocardiographic findings of the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children showing a high prevalence of myocardial injury and systolic dysfunction that improves in the subacute phase. (3) A score assessment of the Fontan associated liver disease which correlated with the risk for Fontan failure. (4) Grown-up congenital heart surgery in 1093 consecutive cases showed that the 30 day mortality may underestimate the mortaility and that the 6 months mortality is likely a better measure in this population. (5) Cone versus conventional repair for Ebstein's anomaly showed better midterm results and freedom from tricuspid regurgitation after the cone operation. (6) Association between race/ethnicity, illness severity, and mortality in children undergoing cardiac surgery.

Sample of 471 Serbian citizens was collected during the first 7â¯weeks of the pandemic. Cluster analysis revealed three clusters based on reactions to the pandemic: Adapted, Antagonized, and Passive. Adaptive type is characterized by stable emotional reactions and adherence to behavioral guidelines. Antagonized cluster is characterized by lowered adherence to behavioral guidelines, while Passive cluster is characterized by increased fear and boredom. Clusters differed significantly on HEXACO and PANAS traits. Similarity of obtained clusters with prototypes that commonly emerge using personality traits for classification, stresses the importance of basic individual differences in pandemic-induced behavior.","Branovacki, Bojan; Sadikovic, Selka; Smederevac, Snezana; Mitrovic, Dusanka; Pajic, Dejan",Pers Individ Dif,,8

However, these efforts are often undermined due to serious concerns over privacy risks associated with collection and processing of personally identifiable information. While a rich set of special-purpose privacy-preserving techniques exist in computer science, they are unable to provide end-to-end protection in alignment with legal principles in the absence of an overarching operational architecture to ensure purpose limitation and protection against insider attacks. This either leads to weak privacy protection in large designs, or adoption of overly defensive strategies to protect privacy by compromising on utility. In this paper, we present an operational architecture for privacy-by-design based on independent regulatory oversight stipulated by most data protection regimes, regulated access control, purpose limitation and data minimisation. We briefly discuss the feasibility of implementing our architecture based on existing techniques. We also present some sample case studies of privacy-preserving design sketches of challenging public service applications.","Agrawal, Prashant; Singh, Anubhutie; Raghavan, Malavika; Sharma, Subodh; Banerjee, Subhashis",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.04654v1.pdf,8

Simplified arithmetic models of COVID-19 transmission, control and elimination are presented in user-friendly Shiny and Excel formats that allow non-specialists to explore, query, critique and understand the containment decisions facing their country and the world at large. Although the predictive model is broadly applicable, the simulations presented are based on parameter values representative of the United Republic of Tanzania, which is still early enough in its epidemic cycle and response to avert a national catastrophe. The predictions of these models illustrate (1) why ambitious lock-down interventions to crush the curve represent the only realistic way for individual countries to contain their national-level epidemics before they turn into outright catastrophes, (2) why these need to be implemented so early, so stringently and for such extended periods, (3) why high prevalence of other pathogens causing similar symptoms to mild COVID-19 precludes the use of contact tracing as a substitute for lock down interventions to contain and eliminate epidemics, (4) why partial containment strategies intended to merely flatten the curve, by maintaining epidemics at manageably low levels, are grossly unrealistic, and (5) why local elimination may only be sustained after lock down ends if imported cases are comprehensively excluded, so international co-operation to conditionally re-open trade and travel between countries certified as free of COVID-19 represents the best strategy for motivating progress towards pandemic eradication at global level. The three sequential goals that every country needs to emphatically embrace are contain, eliminate and exclude. As recently emphasized by the World Health Organization, success will require widespread genuine national unity and unprecedented global solidarity.","Killeen, Gerry F.; Kiware, Samson S.",Infect.

However, testing these mechanical hypotheses on proteins in their natural environment remains inaccesible to conventional tools. To address this limitation, here we demonstrate a mouse model carrying a HaloTag-TEV insertion in the protein titin, the main determinant of myocyte stiffness. Using our system, we specifically sever titin by digestion with TEV protease, and find that the response of muscle fibers to length changes requires mechanical transduction through titin's intact polypeptide chain. In addition, HaloTag-based covalent tethering enables examination of titin dynamics under force using magnetic tweezers. At pulling forces < 10 pN, titin domains are recruited to the unfolded state, and produce 41.5 zJ mechanical work during refolding. Insertion of the HaloTag-TEV cassette in mechanical proteins opens opportunities to explore the molecular basis of cellular force generation, mechanosensing and mechanotransduction.","Rivas-Pardo, Jaime Andrés; Li, Yong; Mártonfalvi, Zsolt; Tapia-Rojo, Rafael; Unger, Andreas; Fernández-Trasancos, Ángel; Herrero-Galán, Elías; Velázquez-Carreras, Diana; Fernández, Julio M; Linke, Wolfgang A; Alegre-Cebollada, Jorge",Nat Commun,,8

There are no known treatment regimens with proven efficacy and vaccines thus far, posing an unprecedented challenge to identify effective drugs and vaccines for prevention and treatment. The urgency for its prevention and cure has resulted in an increased number of proposed treatment options. The high rate and volume of emerging clinical trials on therapies for COVID-19 need to be compared and evaluated to provide scientific evidence for effective medical options. Other emerging non-conventional drug discovery techniques such as bioinformatics and cheminformatics, structure-based drug design, network-based methods for prediction of drug-target interactions, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) and phage technique could provide alternative routes to discovering potent Anti-SARS-CoV2 drugs. While drugs are being repurposed and discovered for COVID-19, novel drug delivery systems will be paramount for efficient delivery and avoidance of possible drug resistance. This review describes the proposed drug targets for therapy, and outcomes of clinical trials that have been reported. It also identifies the adopted treatment modalities that are showing promise, and those that have failed as drug candidates.

The purpose of this study is to examine which socioeconomic status groups are most at risk of treatment interruption among Japanese workers. METHODS: This cross-sectional internet monitor study was conducted among Japanese workers on December 22-26, 2020. Out of a total of 33 302 participants in the survey, 9510 (5392 males and 4118 females) who responded that they required regular treatment or hospital visits were included in the analysis. A multilevel logistic model nested in the prefecture of residence was used to estimate the odds ratio (OR) for treatment disruption. We examined separate multivariate models for socioeconomic factors, health factors, and lifestyle factors. RESULTS: During a period of rapid COVID-19 infection, about 11% of Japanese workers who required regular treatment experienced interruptions to their treatment. The OR of treatment interruption associated with not being married compared with being married was 1.44 (95%CI: 1.17-1.76); manual labor work compared with desk work was 1.30 (95%CI: 1.11-1.52); loss of employment when the COVID-19 pandemic started and continued unemployment compared with being employed over the entire pandemic period was 1.62 (95%CI: 1.13-2.31) and 2.57 (95%CI: 1.63-4.07), respectively; and feeling financially unstable was 2.92 (95%CI: 2.25-3.80). CONCLUSION: Treatment interruption is a new health inequality brought about by COVID-19 with possible medium- and long-term effects, including excess mortality, morbidity, and productivity loss due to increased presenteeism. Efforts are needed to reduce treatment interruptions among workers who require regular treatment.","Fujimoto, Kenji; Ishimaru, Tomohiro; Tateishi, Seiichiro; Nagata, Tomohisa; Tsuji, Mayumi; Eguchi, Hisashi; Ogami, Akira; Matsuda, Shinya; Fujino, Yoshihisa",J Occup Health,,8

483629,COVID-19: Drug Targets and Potential Treatments,2020,"The concept of patient navigation was first introduced in 1989 by the American Cancer Society and was first implemented in 1990 by Dr. Harold Freeman in Harlem, NY. The role of a patient navigator (PN) is to coordinate care between the care team, the patient, and their family while also providing social support. In the last 30â¯years, patient navigation in oncological care has expanded internationally and has been shown to significantly improve patient care experience, especially in the United States cancer care system. Like oncology care, patients who require epilepsy care face socioeconomic and healthcare system barriers and are at significant risk of morbidity and mortality if their care needs are not met. Although shortcomings in epilepsy care are longstanding, the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated these issues as both patients and providers have reported significant delays in care secondary to the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, preliminary studies had shown the potential efficacy of patient navigation in improving epilepsy care. Considering the evidence that such programs are helpful for severely disadvantaged cancer patients and in enhancing epilepsy care, we believe that professional societies should support and encourage PN programs for coordinated and comprehensive care for patients with epilepsy.","Anand, Sharath Kumar; Macki, Mohamed; Culver, Lauren G; Wasade, Vibhangini S; Hendren, Samantha; Schwalb, Jason M",Epilepsy Behav,,8

Many of these advances will also be broadly applicable to other areas of neurosurgery. We have grounded our predictions for future developments in an exploration of what patients and surgeons most desire as outcomes for care. We next examined the recent developments in the field and outlined several promising areas of future improvement in skull base surgery, per se, as well as identifying the new hospital support systems needed to accommodate these changes. These include, but are not limited to, advances in imaging, Raman spectroscopy and microscopy, 3-dimensional printing and rapid prototyping, master-slave and semiautonomous robots, artificial intelligence applications in all areas of medicine, telemedicine, and green technologies in hospitals. In addition, we have reviewed the therapeutic approaches using nanotechnology, genetic engineering, antitumor antibodies, and stem cell technologies to repair damage caused by traumatic injuries, tumors, and iatrogenic injuries to the brain and cranial nerves. Additionally, we have discussed the training requirements for future skull base surgeons and stressed the need for adaptability and change. However, the essential requirements for skull base surgeons will remain unchanged, including knowledge, attention to detail, technical skill, innovation, judgment, and compassion.

487451,Will COVID-19 Transform Translational Medicine?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 has been a public health threat and a worldwide emergency for more than a year. Unfortunately, many questions concerning the pathophysiology, management, and long-term side effects remain unanswered, and novel aspects of the disease keep on emerging. Of concern to healthcare providers are the recent reported cases of reinfection. Serum coronavirus disease 2019 antibodies have been detected within a few days after onset of the disease. However, it remains unclear whether this immune response is universal, or whether it can lead to latent immunity. CASE PRESENTATION: A previously healthy 27-year-old white man presented with fever, chills, back pain, and other constitutional symptoms, 2 days after being exposed to coronavirus disease 2019 positive patients. His severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction was positive, and his symptoms resolved over the next 2 weeks. One month after a confirmatory negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 polymerase chain reaction, he was found to be ineligible for plasma donation as his anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 serology was negative. The patient redeveloped symptoms similar to his first infection 3 weeks after the negative serology test. He and his wife both tested positive via polymerase chain reaction. Their symptoms resolved over the next few days, and they had a negative polymerase chain reaction test 10 days after the positive polymerase chain reaction. CONCLUSION: While studies showed that anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 immunoglobulins start to develop early after infection, our healthy young patient's immune system failed to mount latent immunity against the virus. This left him, especially amid widespread social and medical misconceptions, vulnerable to reinfection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Our case disputes the timelines for immune response that were set and supported by research studies. Our case also raises questions regarding prioritizing vaccinating other individuals over those with prior infection.","Awada, Hussein; Nassereldine, Hasan; Hajj Ali, Adel",J Med Case Rep,,8

This article aimed to systematically identify and summarize (1) the studies that have found a relationship between training load and salivary IgA in team sports, and (2) the studies that have highlighted a relationship between IgA and upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) in team sports. A systematic review of relevant articles was carried out using two electronic databases (PubMed and WoK) until 3 October 2020. From a total of 174 studies initially found, 24 were included in the qualitative synthesis. This systematic review confirmed that lower values of IgA occurred after greater training load (intensity/volume) and congested periods. In this scenario, a low level of IgA was correlated with higher URTI, which makes training load management mandatory to healthcare avoiding immunosuppression. Therefore, physical fitness and conditioning coaches should carefully manage training load progression, avoiding high-intensity sessions in two consecutive days. In addition, they should not program high-intensity training sessions during at least the two days following competition.","Rico-González, Markel; Clemente, Filipe Manuel; Oliveira, Rafael; Bustamante-Hernández, Naia; Pino-Ortega, José",,,8

The number of new cases reported nationally increased from 897 in the previous fortnight (22 June to 5 July) to 3,791 (6 to 19 July). The large increase in cases is due to multiple epidemiologically-linked outbreaks across a range of settings and locations in Victoria (94%; 3,575 cases), with very few cases reported by other jurisdictions (216) in this reporting period. Of the 3,575 cases reported in Victoria, all except one were reported as locally acquired. The majority of these cases were linked to several outbreaks. Of the 216 cases reported from other jurisdictions, approximately 55% (119 cases) were locally acquired. A total of 37 deaths were reported, all from Victoria. On average, 271 cases were reported each day over the reporting period, an increase from 54 cases per day over the previous reporting period. Testing rates have increased across all jurisdictions, predominantly in Victoria, with the nationwide cumulative positivity rate remaining very low at less than 0.5%.

488174,Histone H4 directly stimulates neutrophil activation through membrane permeabilization,2020,"Integrated developmental and elemental information in teeth provide a unique framework for documenting breastfeeding histories, physiological disruptions, and neurotoxicant exposure in humans and our primate relatives, including ancient hominins. Here we detail our method for detecting the consumption of mothers' milk and exploring health history through the use of laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) mapping of sectioned nonhuman primate teeth. Calcium-normalized barium and lead concentrations in tooth enamel and dentine may reflect milk and formula consumption with minimal modification during subsequent tooth mineralization, particularly in dentine. However, skeletal resorption during severe illness, and bioavailable metals in nonmilk foods, can complicate interpretations of nursing behavior. We show that explorations of the patterning of multiple elements may aid in the distinction of these important etiologies. Targeted studies of skeletal chemistry, gastrointestinal maturation, and the dietary bioavailability of metals are needed to optimize these unique records of human health and behavior.","Smith, Tanya M; Cook, Luisa; Dirks, Wendy; Green, Daniel R; Austin, Christine",Bioessays,,8
488470,"Ferroptosis at the crossroads of infection, aging and cancer",2020,"Background: The worldwide surge in coronavirus cases has led to the COVID-19 testing demand surge. Rapid, accurate, and cost-effective COVID-19 screening tests working at a population level are in imperative demand globally. Methods: Based on the eye symptoms of COVID-19, we developed and tested a COVID-19 rapid prescreening model using the eye-region images captured in China and Spain with cellphone cameras. The convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-based model was trained on these eye images to complete binary classification task of identifying the COVID-19 cases. The performance was measured using area under receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and F1. The application programming interface was open access. Findings: The multicenter study included 2436 pictures corresponding to 657 subjects (155 COVID-19 infection, 23.6%) in development dataset (train and validation) and 2138 pictures corresponding to 478 subjects (64 COVID-19 infections, 13.4%) in test dataset. The image-level performance of COVID-19 prescreening model in the China-Spain multicenter study achieved an AUC of 0.913 (95% CI, 0.898-0.927), with a sensitivity of 0.695 (95% CI, 0.643-0.748), a specificity of 0.904 (95% CI, 0.891 -0.919), an accuracy of 0.875(0.861-0.889), and a F1 of 0.611(0.568-0.655). Interpretation: The CNN-based model for COVID-19 rapid prescreening has reliable specificity and sensitivity.

491912,BRD4 modulates vulnerability of triple-negative breast cancer to targeting of integrin-dependent signaling pathways,2020,"The Activation-Induced Cell Death (AICD) is a stimulation-dependent form of apoptosis used by the organism to shutdown T-cell response once the source of inflammation has been eliminated, while allowing the generation of immune memory. AICD is thought to progress through the activation of the extrinsic Fas/FasL pathway of cell death, leading to cytochrome-C release through caspase-8 and Bid activation. We recently described that, early upon AICD induction, mitochondria undergo structural alterations, which are required to promote cytochrome-C release and execute cell death. Here, we found that such alterations do not depend on the Fas/FasL pathway, which is instead only lately activated to amplify the cell death cascade. Instead, such alterations are primarily dependent on the MAPK proteins JNK1 and ERK1/2, which, in turn, regulate the activity of the pro-fission protein Drp1 and the pro-apoptotic factor Bim. The latter regulates cristae disassembly and cooperate with Drp1 to mediate the Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Permeabilization (MOMP), leading to cytochrome-C release. Interestingly, we found that Bim is also downregulated in T-cell Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (T-ALL) cells, this alteration favouring their escape from AICD-mediated control.","Simula, Luca; Corrado, Mauro; Accordi, Benedetta; Di Rita, Anthea; Nazio, Francesca; Antonucci, Ylenia; Di Daniele, Arianna; Caicci, Federico; Caruana, Ignazio; Soriano, Maria Eugenia; Pigazzi, Martina; Locatelli, Franco; Cecconi, Francesco; Campello, Silvia",Cell death differ,,8

(Special section: Therapeutic targets and pharmacological treatment of COVID-19.),2021,"Long-range heteronuclear single quantum correlation (LR-HSQC) experiments may be applied for detecting long-range correlations but suffer from two disadvantages, common to all heteronuclear long-range correlation experiments: (i) The information density in LR-HSQC spectra may be too high to be used directly without ""filtering out"" shorter range correlations, and (ii) often, substantial differences in intensity among cross peaks exist, potentially hampering the visualization of weak, often crucial cross peaks. In this contribution, we propose a modified LR-HSQC experiment, the LR-HTQC experiment (Long-Range Heteronuclear Triple Quantum Correlation) that partially solves the problems aforementioned. We show theoretically and experimentally that the LR-HTQC experiment removes the intense cross peaks of CH spin pairs, substantially reduces the medium intensity of cross peaks originating from CHH' spin systems, whereas the typically weak intensity of cross peaks of CHH'Hâ³ and C(H)n, n > 3 spin systems is less affected. Consequently, the LR-HTQC experiment affords simplified long-range heteronuclear shift correlation spectra and scales down large intensity differences among different types of cross peaks, although a certain general reduction of signal intensities has to be accepted.","Bigler, Peter; Furrer, Julien",Magn Reson Chem,,8

This multicenter study included 56 patients with COVID-19 treated in Jilin Province, China, from January 21, 2020 to March 5, 2020. The laboratory findings, epidemiological characteristics and demographic data were extracted from electronic medical records. The average value of eosinophils and carbon dioxide combining power continued to significantly increase, while the average value of cardiac troponin I and mean platelet volume decreased throughout the course of the disease. The average value of lymphocytes approached the lower limit of the reference interval for the first 5 days and then rose slowly thereafter. The average value of thrombocytocrit peaked on day 7 and slowly declined thereafter. The average value of mean corpuscular volume and serum sodium showed an upward trend from day 8 and day 15, respectively. Age, sex, lactate dehydrogenase, platelet count and globulin level were included in the final model to predict the probability of recovery. The above parameters were verified in 24 patients with COVID-19 in another area of Jilin Province.

Respondents were fearful, averaging a score of nearly 7 on a scale of 10 when asked how fearful they were of COVID-19. Preliminary analysis suggests clear spatial diffusion of COVID-19 fear. Fear appears to be concentrated in regions with the highest reported COVID-19 cases. Significant differences across several U.S. census regions are noted (p < .01). Additionally, significant bivariate relationships were found between socially vulnerable respondents (female, Asians, Hispanic, foreign-born, families with children) and fear, as well as with mental health consequences (anxiety and depressive symptoms). Depressive symptoms, on average, were high (16+ on the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression scale), and more than 25% of the sample reported moderate to severe anxiety symptoms.

However, effective, tailored mental health services and interventions cannot be achieved until we understand the patterns of mental health issues emerging after a public health crisis, especially in the context of the rapid transmission of COVID-19. Understanding the public's emotions and needs and their distribution attributes are therefore critical for creating appropriate public policies and eventually responding to the health crisis effectively, efficiently, and equitably. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to detect the temporal patterns in emotional fluctuation, significant events during the COVID-19 pandemic that affected emotional changes and variations, and hourly variations of emotions within a single day by analyzing data from the Chinese social media platform Weibo. METHODS: Based on a longitudinal dataset of 816,556 posts published by 27,912 Weibo users in Wuhan, China, from December 31, 2019, to April 31, 2020, we processed general sentiment inclination rating and the type of sentiments of Weibo posts by using pandas and SnowNLP Python libraries. We also grouped the publication times into 5 time groups to measure changes in netizens' sentiments during different periods in a single day. RESULTS: Overall, negative emotions such as surprise, fear, and anger were the most salient emotions detected on Weibo. These emotions were triggered by certain milestone events such as the confirmation of human-to-human transmission of COVID-19. Emotions varied within a day. Although all emotions were more prevalent in the afternoon and night, fear and anger were more dominant in the morning and afternoon, whereas depression was more salient during the night. CONCLUSIONS: Various milestone events during the COVID-19 pandemic were the primary events that ignited netizens' emotions. In addition, Weibo users' emotions varied within a day. Our findings provide insights into providing better-tailored mental health services and interventions.","Yu, Shaobin; Eisenman, David; Han, Ziqiang",J Med Internet Res,,8

The aims of this study were to compare the clinical and echocardiographic characteristics of inpatients in the intensive-care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients. METHODS: We recruited 416 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and divided them into two groups: ICU (n = 35) and non-ICU (n = 381). Medical histories, laboratory findings, and echocardiography data were compared. RESULTS: The levels of myocardial injury markers in ICU vs non-ICU patients were as follows: troponin I (0.029 ng/mL [0.007-0.063] vs 0.006 ng/mL [0.006-0.006]) and myoglobin (65.45 µg/L [39.77-130.57] vs 37.00 µg/L [26.40-53.54]). Echocardiographic findings included ventricular wall thickening (12 [39%] vs 1 [4%]), pulmonary hypertension (9 [29%] vs 0 [0%]), and reduced left-ventricular ejection fraction (5 [16%] vs 0 [0%]). Overall, 10% of the ICU patients presented with right heart enlargement, thickened right-ventricular wall, decreased right heart function, and pericardial effusion. Cardiac complications were more common in ICU patients, including acute cardiac injury (21 [60%] vs 13 [3%]) (including 2 cases of fulminant myocarditis), atrial or ventricular tachyarrhythmia (3 [9%] vs 3 [1%]), and acute heart failure (5 [14%] vs 0 [0%]). CONCLUSION: Myocardial injury marker elevation, ventricular wall thickening, pulmonary artery hypertension, and cardiac complications including acute myocardial injury, arrhythmia, and acute heart failure are more common in ICU patients with COVID-19. Cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients may be related more to the systemic response after infection rather than direct damage by coronavirus.","Zeng, Jia-Hui; Wu, Wei-Bo; Qu, Jiu-Xin; Wang, Yao; Dong, Chang-Feng; Luo, Yong-Fang; Zhou, Dan; Feng, Wen-Xia; Feng, Cheng",Infection,,8

The rollout of diagnostic testing in the United States was slow, leading to numerous cases that were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 in February and March 2020 and necessitating the use of serological testing to determine past infections. Here, we evaluated the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test for detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies by testing 3 distinct patient populations. We tested 1,020 serum specimens collected prior to SARS-CoV-2 circulation in the United States and found one false positive, indicating a specificity of 99.90%. We tested 125 patients who tested reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) positive for SARS-CoV-2 for whom 689 excess serum specimens were available and found that sensitivity reached 100% at day 17 after symptom onset and day 13 after PCR positivity. Alternative index value thresholds for positivity resulted in 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity in this cohort. We tested specimens from 4,856 individuals from Boise, ID, collected over 1 week in April 2020 as part of the Crush the Curve initiative and detected 87 positives for a positivity rate of 1.79%. These data demonstrate excellent analytical performance of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG test as well as the limited circulation of the virus in the western United States. We expect that the availability of high-quality serological testing will be a key tool in the fight against SARS-CoV-2.","Bryan, Andrew; Pepper, Gregory; Wener, Mark H; Fink, Susan L; Morishima, Chihiro; Chaudhary, Anu; Jerome, Keith R; Mathias, Patrick C; Greninger, Alexander L",J. clin. microbiol,,8
508144,The role of NO in COVID-19 and potential therapeutic strategies,2021,"AIMS: The main severe complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection are pneumonia and respiratory distress syndrome. Recent studies, however, reported that cardiac injury, as assessed by troponin levels, is associated with a worse outcome in these patients. No study hitherto assessed whether the simple standard electrocardiogram (ECG) may be helpful for risk stratification in these patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 324 consecutive patients admitted to our Emergency Department with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Standard 12-lead ECG recorded on admission was assessed for cardiac rhythm and rate, atrioventricular and intraventricular conduction, abnormal Q/QS wave, ST segment and T wave changes, corrected QT interval, and tachyarrhythmias. At a mean follow-up of 31 ± 11 days, 44 deaths occurred (13.6%). Most ECG variables were significantly associated with mortality, including atrial fibrillation (P = 0.002), increasing heart rate (P = 0.002), presence of left bundle branch block (LBBB; P < 0.001), QRS duration (P <0 .001), a QRS duration of &#8805;110 ms (P < 0.001), ST segment depression (P < 0.001), abnormal Q/QS wave (P = 0.034), premature ventricular complexes (PVCs; P = 0.051), and presence of any ECG abnormality [hazard ratio (HR) 4.58; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.40-8.76; P < 0.001]. At multivariable analysis, QRS duration (P = 0.002), QRS duration &#8805;110 ms (P = 0.03), LBBB (P = 0.014) and presence of any ECG abnormality (P = 0.04) maintained a significant independent association with mortality. CONCLUSION: Our data show that standard ECG can be helpful for an initial risk stratification of patients admitted for SARS-CoV-2 infectious disease.","Lanza, Gaetano Antonio; De Vita, Antonio; Ravenna, Salvatore Emanuele; D039,; Aiello, Alessia; Covino, Marcello; Franceschi, Francesco; Crea, Filippo",Europace,,8
508779,Correction to: Letter to the Editor-Recent advances in Lynch syndrome: response to Møller et al,2021,"During spring 2020, emergency remote teaching became the norm for hundreds of higher education institutions in the United States due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Librarians were suddenly tasked with moving in-person services and resources online. For librarians with instruction responsibilities, this online mandate meant deciding between synchronous and asynchronous sessions, learning new technologies and tools for active learning, and vetting these same tools for security issues and ADA compliance. In an effort to understand our shared and unique experiences with emergency remote teaching, the authors surveyed 202 academic instruction librarians in order to answer the following questions: (1) What technology tools are academic librarians using to deliver content and engage student participation in emergency remote library sessions during COVID-19? (2) What do instruction librarians perceive as the strengths and weaknesses of these tools? (3) What digital literacy gaps are instruction librarians identifying right now that may prevent access to equitable information literacy instruction online? This study will deliver and discuss findings from the survey as well as make recommendations toward best practices for utilizing technology tools and assessing them for equity and student engagement.","Ibacache, Kathia Koob Amanda Rybin Vance Eric",Information Technology and Libraries (Online),,8

514190,Effect of NADPH oxidase inhibitors in an experimental retinal model of excitotoxicity,2020,"Despite the severity of the COVID-19 crisis, which has affected organizations worldwide, there is a lack of research on the organizational factors that affect the psychological wellbeing of the employees of an organization affected by the crisis. This research uses the case of employees at two international universities in Thailand that have been directly affected by the COVID-19 crisis. Grounded in social support theory and the job-demand resource model of job stress, this research examines the role of supervisor support in explaining the degree of perceived uncertainties and emotional exhaustion that employees experience due to the COVID-19 crisis. Moreover, this research examines whether the effect of supervisor support on the perceived uncertainties of employees can be moderated by organizational intransigence, that is, a prevailing climate of resistance to change at the workplace. The questionnaire survey data were obtained from a sample of 300 employees at two private international universities, and the partial least squares structural equation model was used for data analysis. The results significantly confirm that supervisor support has a negative effect on the perceived uncertainties of employees. Perceived uncertainties also significantly mediate the negative effect of supervisor support on the employees' emotional exhaustion. More importantly, the moderating effect analysis shows that the negative effect of supervisor support on the perceived uncertainties of employees presents only for employees who work in a workplace climate where there is low intransigence; in a workplace climate where there is high intransigence, supervisor support does not lower the perceived uncertainties of employees.","Charoensukmongkol, Peerayuth; Phungsoonthorn, Tipnuch",J Gen Psychol,,8
514576,The riddle of the Sphinx: why sphingosine-1-phosphate may help define molecular mechanisms underlying risk stratification for serious COVID-19 infections,2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emergent pathogen responsible for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since its emergence, the novel coronavirus has rapidly achieved pandemic proportions causing remarkably increased morbidity and mortality around the world. A hypercoagulability state has been reported as a major pathologic event in COVID-19, and thromboembolic complications listed among life-threatening complications of the disease. Platelets are chief effector cells of hemostasis and pathological thrombosis. However, the participation of platelets in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 remains elusive. This report demonstrates that increased platelet activation and platelet-monocyte aggregate formation are observed in severe COVID-19 patients, but not in patients presenting mild COVID-19 syndrome. In addition, exposure to plasma from severe COVID-19 patients increased the activation of control platelets ex vivo. In our cohort of COVID-19 patients admitted to the intensive care unit, platelet-monocyte interaction was strongly associated with tissue factor (TF) expression by the monocytes. Platelet activation and monocyte TF expression were associated with markers of coagulation exacerbation as fibrinogen and D-dimers, and were increased in patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation or patients who evolved with in-hospital mortality. Finally, platelets from severe COVID-19 patients were able to induce TF expression ex vivo in monocytes from healthy volunteers, a phenomenon that was inhibited by platelet P-selectin neutralization or integrin &#945;IIb/ß3 blocking with the aggregation inhibitor abciximab. Altogether, these data shed light on new pathological mechanisms involving platelet activation and platelet-dependent monocyte TF expression, which were associated with COVID-19 severity and mortality.","Hottz, Eugenio D; Azevedo-Quintanilha, Isaclaudia G; Palhinha, Lohanna; Teixeira, Lívia; Barreto, Ester A; Pão, Camila R R; Righy, Cassia; Franco, Sérgio; Souza, Thiago M L; Kurtz, Pedro; Bozza, Fernando A; Bozza, Patrícia T",Blood,,8

515345,Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases following COVID-19,2020,"Antipsychotic-induced weight gain is a major health concern in children and adolescents. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for weight gain during short-, middle- and long-term treatment with antipsychotic drugs in this young population. We analysed a combined prospective and a retrospective observational cohort of Dutch children and adolescents, starting with risperidone, aripiprazole or pipamperone treatment. Linear mixed models were used to test whether sex, age, baseline body-mass-index (BMI) z score, type of antipsychotic, dose equivalent/kg, duration of use, previous antipsychotic use, ethnicity, physical exercise, IQ, concomitant medication, and psychiatric classification predicted the BMI z score for a follow-up of < 15 weeks, 15-52 weeks or > 52 weeks. A total of 144 patients were included with a median [interquartile range ([IQR)] age of 9 (4) years and median follow-up of 30 (73) weeks. During the complete follow-up, the median (IQR) weight gain was 0.37 (0.95) BMI z score points. Antipsychotic-induced weight gain was found to be most pronounced during the first 15 weeks of use (BMI z score increase per week ß = 0.02, 95% CI 0.01-0.03, p = 0.002). A higher baseline BMI z score and the absence of stimulant use were associated with a higher BMI z score during the entire follow-up and after 15 weeks, respectively. Previous treatment with an antipsychotic drug was associated with less weight gain during the first 15 weeks of treatment. Our findings underscore the importance of close patient monitoring during the first weeks of antipsychotic treatment with a focus on patients with a high baseline BMI z score.","van der Esch, Casper C L; Kloosterboer, Sanne M; van der Ende, Jan; Reichart, Catrien G; Kouijzer, Mirjam E J; de Kroon, Matthias M J; van Daalen, Emma; Ester, Wietske A; Rieken, Rob; Dieleman, Gwen C; Hillegers, Manon H J; van Gelder, Teun; Koch, Birgit C P; Dierckx, Bram",Eur. child adolesc. psychiatry,,8

We aim to describe here the various clinical presentations of this disease by examining eleven cases. METHODS: Electronic medical records of 11 patients with COVID-19 were collected, and demographics, clinical manifestations, outcomes, key laboratory results, and radiological images are discussed. RESULTS: The clinical course of the eleven cases demonstrated the complexity of the COVID-19 profile with different clinical presentations. Clinical manifestations range from asymptomatic cases to patients with mild and severe symptoms, with or without pneumonia. Laboratory detection of the viral nucleic acid can yield false-negative results, and serological testing of virus-specific IgG and IgM antibodies should be used as an alternative for diagnosis. Patients with common allergic diseases did not develop distinct symptoms and severe courses. Cases with a pre-existing condition of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or complicated with a secondary bacterial pneumonia were more severe. CONCLUSION: All different clinical characteristics of COVID-19 should be taken into consideration to identify patients that need to be in strict quarantine for the efficient containment of the pandemic.","Dong, Xiang; Cao, Yi-Yuan; Lu, Xiao-Xia; Zhang, Jin-Jin; Du, Hui; Yan, You-Qin; Akdis, Cezmi A; Gao, Ya-Dong",Allergy,,8

The resultant respiratory disease was subsequently named COVID-19. In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, primary care optometry practices only remained open to deliver essential or emergency eye care. This study aimed to characterise the experiences of United Kingdom (UK)-based primary care optometrists during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: An email invitation to participate in an online cross-sectional survey was sent to 3000 UK-based, currently practicing members of The College of Optometrists (UK). Responses to the structured questionnaire were analysed using descriptive statistics, including frequencies, means and standard deviations. Frequency analyses were used to evaluate items with multiple responses. Free-text responses were examined using thematic analyses. RESULTS: After data cleaning, a total of 1250 responses remained. Sixty-three percent were female, 70% self-identified as being of white ethnicity and 78% were based in England. During the first national lockdown, over half of all respondents were involved with the provision of remote consultations for emergency/urgent care. The majority felt 'very'/'moderately' comfortable conducting remote consultations, but 66% felt professional liability was increased. Forty percent were involved in the provision of face-to-face consultations. Eye-health and vision-related problems were the most commonly reported patient issues during both remote and face-to-face consultations, while contact-lens related problems were the least. Thematic analysis of the responses showed several challenges adjusting to the pandemic (e.g., working safely), but also some potential benefits (e.g., increased skills). CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide an overview of changes to optometric practice in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results may be used to inform the development of professional guidance and facilitate resource allocation for safe and effective eye care during this and any future pandemics.","Nagra, Manbir; Allen, Peter M; Norgett, Yvonne; Beukes, Eldre; Bowen, Michael; Vianya-Estopa, Marta",Ophthalmic Physiol Opt,,8

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to compare two nonpharmacological respiratory treatment methods for home-isolated COVID-19 patients using a newly developed telemanagement health care system. METHODS: In this single-blinded randomized clinical trial, 60 patients with stage 1 pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection were treated. Group A (n=30) received oxygen therapy with bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) ventilation, and Group B (n=30) received osteopathic manipulative respiratory and physical therapy techniques. Arterial blood gases of PaO2 and PaCO2, pH, vital signs (ie, temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, heart rate, and blood pressure), and chest computed tomography scans were used for follow-up and for assessment of the course and duration of recovery. RESULTS: Analysis of the results showed a significant difference between the two groups (P<.05), with Group A showing shorter recovery periods than Group B (mean 14.9, SD 1.7 days, and mean 23.9, SD 2.3 days, respectively). Significant differences were also observed between baseline and final readings in all of the outcome measures in both groups (P<.05). Regarding posttreatment satisfaction with our proposed telemanagement health care system, positive responses were given by most of the patients in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: It was found that home-based oxygen therapy with BiPAP can be a more effective prophylactic treatment approach than osteopathic manipulative respiratory and physical therapy techniques, as it can impede exacerbation of early-stage COVID-19 pneumonia. Telemanagement health care systems are promising methods to help in the pandemic-related shortage of hospital beds, as they showed reasonable effectiveness and reliability in the monitoring and management of patients with early-stage COVID-19 pneumonia.

It is the primeval first response of the body to any severe condition of the eye such as trauma, infections and inflammation. The pain can be due to conditions directly affecting the eye and ocular adnexa; or indirect which would manifest as referred pain from other organ structures such as the central nervous system. Paradoxically, there are several minor and non-sight threatening conditions, which also leads to ocular pain and does not merit urgent hospital visits. In this perspective, we intend to provide guidelines to the practising ophthalmologist for teleconsultation when a patient complains of pain with focus on how to differentiate the various diagnoses that can be managed over teleconsultation and those requiring emergency care in the clinic. These guidelines can decrease unnecessary hospital visits, which is the need of the hour in the pandemic era and also beyond.

There is an urgent need to develop technology-enabled tailored solutions to support the self-care needs of these parents. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to use a participatory design approach to describe and compare Latino and non-Latino parents’ current self-care practices, needs, and technology preferences when caring for children with asthma in marginalized communities. METHODS: The participatory design approach was used to actively engage intended users in the design process and empower them to identify needs and generate design ideas to meet those needs. RESULTS: Thirteen stakeholders participated in three design sessions. We described Latino and non-Latino parents’ similarities in self-care practices and cultural-specific preferences. When coming up with ideas of technologies for self-care, non-Latino parents focused on improving caregiving stress through journaling, daily affirmations, and tracking feelings, while Latino parents focused more on relaxation and entertainment. CONCLUSIONS: Considerations need to be taken beyond language differences when developing technology-enabled interventions for diverse populations. The community partnership approach strengthened the study’s inclusive design.","Yuwen, Weichao; Duran, Miriana; Tan, Minghui; Ward, Teresa M; Cheng, Sunny Chieh; Ramirez, Magaly",JMIR Pediatr Parent,https://doi.org/10.2196/27542; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34156343/,8

The percentage of infected individuals who seroconvert is still an open question. In addition, it has been shown in some individuals that viral genome can still be detected at considerable time post symptom resolution. Here we investigated both seroconversion and PCR-positivity in a large cohort of convalescent serum donors in New York City. Methods: Individuals with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were screened via PCR for presence of viral genome and via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for presence of anti SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies. Results: All but three confirmed SARS-CoV-2 patients seroconverted to the SARS-CoV-2 spike while only 37.4% of suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients seroconverted. PCR-positivity was detected up to 28 days from symptom resolution. Conclusions: Here we show that the vast majority of confirmed COVID19 patients seroconvert, potentially providing immunity to reinfection. We also report that in a large proportion of individuals, viral genome can be detected via PCR in the upper respiratory tract for weeks post symptom resolution, but it is unclear if this signal represents infectious virus.","Wajnberg, Ania; Mansour, Mayce; Leven, Emily; Bouvier, Nicole M; Patel, Gopi; Firpo, Adolfo; Mendu, Rao; Jhang, Jeffrey; Arinsburg, Suzanne; Gitman, Melissa; Houldsworth, Jane; Baine, Ian; Simon, Viviana; Aberg, Judith; Krammer, Florian; Reich, David; Cordon-Cardo, Carlos",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.30.20085613; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.30.20085613v1?rss=1,8

Lyfe is defined as any system that fulfills all four processes of the living state, namely: dissipation, autocatalysis, homeostasis, and learning. Life is defined as the instance of lyfe that we are familiar with on Earth, one that uses a specific organometallic molecular toolbox to record information about its environment and achieve dynamical order by dissipating certain planetary disequilibria. This new classification system allows the astrobiological community to more clearly define the questions that propel their research—e.g., whether they are developing a historical narrative to explain the origin of life (on Earth), or a universal narrative for the emergence of lyfe, or whether they are seeking signs of life specifically, or lyfe at large across the universe. While the concept of “life as we don’t know it” is not new, the four pillars of lyfe offer a novel perspective on the living state that is indifferent to the particular components that might produce it.","Bartlett, Stuart; Wong, Michael L.",Life (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32316364/; https://doi.org/10.3390/life10040042,8

Although the World Health Organization and national health authorities are sparing no effort to contain the disease and to find a cure for the potentially deadly infection, SARS has an impact on our liver transplantation (LTx) program. Before the SARS outbreak, an average of 1 LTx was performed per month in our center. For 6 months since the outbreak, there had been no LTx performed. The intensive care unit had to be dedicated to patients with SARS. Two of the LTx team members were struck by SARS. A survey conducted among LTx recipients and their family members (n = 45) demonstrated symptoms of anxiety and stress in all. Some LTx recipients were treated at the Emergency Department for suspected SARS, which were later confirmed to be false alarms. Many LTx patients were too frightened to come back for follow-up. A new strain of coronavirus was identified as the causative agent. The origin of this virus is uncertain but the probability of zoonoses is being seriously discussed. Not only are immunosuppressed patients exposed to higher risk of infection, but also the waiting list mortality is also expected to increase. The SARS outbreak has demonstrated the vulnerability of an organ transplantation service and reminds us of the fearful possibility of zoonoses in future xeno-transplantation.","Chui, A.K.K.; Rao, A.R.N.; Chan, H.L.Y.; Hui, A.Y.",Transplant Proc,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0041134504008735; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15561228/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0041134504008735,8

The county is one of the most resource-limited in the state, with only two hospitals serving its 180,000 citizens, and no tertiary care centers. A significant portion of the population cared for at the local hospitals commutes from Mexicali, a large city of 1.2 million persons, just south of Imperial County’s ports of entry. Since May 2020, following an outbreak in Mexicali, Imperial County has seen a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 patients, quickly outpacing its local resources. In response to this surge an alternate care site (ACS) was created as part of a collaboration between the California State Emergency Medical Service Authority (EMSA) and the county. In the first month of operations (May 26–June 26, 2020) the ACS received 106 patients with an average length of stay of 3.6 days. The average patient age was 55.5 years old with a range of 19–95 years. Disposition of patients included 25.5% sent to the emergency department for acute care needs, 1.8% who left against medical advice, and 72.7% who were discharged home or to a skilled nursing facility. There were no deaths on site. This study shares early experiences, challenges, and innovations created with the implementation of this ACS.

In the current scenario, the Brazil and the United States of America present a high daily incidence of new cases and deaths. Therefore, it is important to forecast the number of new cases in a time window of one week, once this can help the public health system developing strategic planning to deals with the COVID-19. The application of the forecasting artificial intelligence (AI) models has the potential of deal with dynamical behavior of time-series like of COVID-19. In this paper, Bayesian regression neural network, cubist regression, k-nearest neighbors, quantile random forest, and support vector regression, are used stand-alone, and coupled with the recent pre-processing variational mode decomposition (VMD) employed to decompose the time series into several intrinsic mode functions. All AI techniques are evaluated in the task of time-series forecasting with one, three, and six-days-ahead the cumulative COVID-19 cases in five Brazilian and American states, with a high number of cases up to April 28th, 2020. Previous cumulative COVID-19 cases and exogenous variables as daily temperature and precipitation were employed as inputs for all forecasting models. The models’ effectiveness are evaluated based on the performance criteria. In general, the hybridization of VMD outperformed single forecasting models regarding the accuracy, specifically when the horizon is six-days-ahead, the hybrid VMD–single models achieved better accuracy in 70% of the cases. Regarding the exogenous variables, the importance ranking as predictor variables is, from the upper to the lower, past cases, temperature, and precipitation. Therefore, due to the efficiency of evaluated models to forecasting cumulative COVID-19 cases up to six-days-ahead, the adopted models can be recommended as a promising models for forecasting and be used to assist in the development of public policies to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 outbreak.","da Silva, Ramon Gomes; Ribeiro, Matheus Henrique Dal Molin; Mariani, Viviana Cocco; Coelho, Leandro dos Santos",Chaos Solitons Fractals,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834591/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0960077920304252; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2020.110027; https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.10981v1.pdf; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077920304252,8

In recent decades, more and more Chinese scholars have used the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database for clinical cancer research. A comprehensive bibliometric study is required to analyze the tendency of Chinese scholars to utilize the SEER database for clinical cancer research and provide a reference for the future of big data analytics. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to assess the trend of publications on clinical cancer research in mainland China from the SEER database. METHODS: We performed a PubMed search to identify papers published with data from the SEER database in mainland China until August 31, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 1566 papers utilizing the SEER database that were authored by investigators in mainland China were identified. Over the past years, significant growth in studies based on the SEER database was observed (P<.001).

600956,Behavioural change models for infectious disease transmission: a systematic review (2010–2015),2016-12-11,"Abstract SARS-coronavirus 2 is the causal agent of the COVID-19 outbreak. SARS-Cov-2 entry into a cell is dependent upon binding of the viral spike (S) protein to cellular receptor and on cleavage of the spike protein by the host cell proteases such as Cathepsin L and Cathepsin B. CTSL/B are crucial elements of lysosomal pathway and both enzymes are almost exclusively located in the lysosomes. CTSL disruption offers potential for CoVID-19 therapies. The mechanisms of disruption include: decreasing expression of CTSL, direct inhibition of CTSL activity and affecting the conditions of CTSL environment (increase pH in the lysosomes). We have conducted a high throughput drug screen gene expression analysis to identify compounds that would downregulate the expression of CTSL/CTSB. One of the top significant results shown to downregulate the expression of the CTSL gene is amantadine (10uM). Amantadine was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 1968 as a prophylactic agent for influenza and later for Parkinson's disease. It is available as a generic drug. Amantadine in addition to downregulating CTSL appears to further disrupt lysosomal pathway, hence, interfering with the capacity of the virus to replicate. It acts as a lysosomotropic agent altering the CTSL functional environment. We hypothesize that amantadine could decrease the viral load in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and as such it may serve as a potent therapeutic decreasing the replication and infectivity of the virus likely leading to better clinical outcomes. Clinical studies will be needed to examine the therapeutic utility of amantadine in COVID-19 infection.","Smieszek, Sandra P.; Przychodzen, Bart P; Polymeropoulos, Mihael H.",Int J Antimicrob Agents,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S092485792030162X; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2020.106004; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32361028/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092485792030162X?v=s5,8

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cohort study included 115 adult patients admitted to the ICU with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Anthropometric variables and biochemical (C-reactive protein, ferritin, leukocyte, neutrophils, and fibrinogen) were measured. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the associations. RESULTS: Mean age was 50.6 ± 11.2 years, 68.7% were male. Median BMI was 30.9 kg/m(2). All patients had invasive mechanical ventilation. Patients with diabetes had increased risk of mortality with OR of 2.86 (CI 95% 1.1-7.4, p = 0.026); among those patients who, in addition to diabetes had obesity, the risk was de 3.17 (CI 95% 1.9-10.2, p = 0.038). Patients with obesity had 1.25 times greater risk of developing a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (95% CI 1.09-1.46, p = 0.025). Negative correlation was observed between BMI and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio (r = -0.023, p < 0.05).

Influenza continues to result in a large burden of excess morbidity and mortality. Two effective measures, inactivated influenza vaccine, and the antiviral drugs rimantadine and amantadine, are currently available for control of this disease. Inactivated vaccine should be given yearly to all of those over the age of 65, as well as younger individuals with high-risk medical conditions and individuals delivering care to such persons. Live, intranasally administered attenuated influenza vaccines are also in development, and may be useful in combination with inactivated vaccine in the elderly. The antiviral drugs amantadine and rimantadine are effective in the treatment and prevention of influenza A, although rimantadine is associated with fewer side-effects. Recently, the inhaled neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir, which is active against both influenza A and B viruses, was licensed for use in uncomplicated influenza. The role of this drug in treatment and prevention of influenza in the elderly remains to be determined. Additional neuraminidase inhibitors are also being developed. In addition, to influenza, respiratory infections with respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, and coronavirus have been identified as potential problems in the elderly. With increasing attention, it is probable that the impact of these infections in this age group will be more extensively documented. Understanding of the immunology and pathogenesis of these infections in elderly adults is in its infancy, and considerable additional work will need to be performed towards development of effective control measures.","Treanor, John; Falsey, Ann",Antiviral Res,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354299000625; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10669259/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0166354299000625,8
602576,"Obesity cardiomyopathy: evidence, mechanisms, and therapeutic implications",2021-10-01,"PURPOSE: The increasing diabetes prevalence and advent of new treatments for its major visual-threatening complications (diabetic macular edema [DME] and proliferative diabetic retinopathy [PDR]), which require frequent life-long follow-up, have increased hospital demands markedly. Subsequent delays in patient's evaluation and treatment are causing sight loss. Strategies to increase capacity are needed urgently. The retinopathy (EMERALD) study tested diagnostic accuracy, acceptability, and costs of a new health care pathway for people with previously treated DME or PDR. DESIGN: Prospective, multicenter, case-referent, cross-sectional, diagnostic accuracy study undertaken in 13 hospitals in the United Kingdom. PARTICIPANTS: Adults with type 1 or 2 diabetes previously successfully treated DME or PDR who, at the time of enrollment, had active or inactive disease. METHODS: A new health care pathway entailing multimodal imaging (spectral-domain OCT for DME, and 7-field Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study [ETDRS] and ultra-widefield [UWF] fundus images for PDR) interpreted by trained nonmedical staff (ophthalmic graders) to detect reactivation of disease was compared with the current standard care (face-to-face examination by ophthalmologists). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome: sensitivity of the new pathway. Secondary outcomes: specificity; agreement between pathways; costs; acceptability; proportions requiring subsequent ophthalmologist assessment, unable to undergo imaging, and with inadequate images or indeterminate findings. RESULTS: The new pathway showed sensitivity of 97% (95% confidence interval [CI], 92%–99%) and specificity of 31% (95% CI, 23%–40%) to detect DME. For PDR, sensitivity and specificity using 7-field ETDRS images (85% [95% CI, 77%–91%] and 48% [95% CI, 41%–56%], respectively) or UWF images (83% [95% CI, 75%–89%] and 54% [95% CI, 46%–61%], respectively) were comparable. For detection of high-risk PDR, sensitivity and specificity were higher when using UWF images (87% [95% CI, 78%–93%] and 49% [95% CI, 42%–56%], respectively, for UWF versus 80% [95% CI, 69–88%] and 40% [95% CI, 34%–47%], respectively, for 7-field ETDRS images). Participants preferred ophthalmologists’ assessments; in their absence, they preferred immediate feedback by graders, maintaining periodic ophthalmologist evaluations. When compared with the current standard of care, the new pathway could save £1390 per 100 DME visits and between £461 and £1189 per 100 PDR visits. CONCLUSIONS: The new pathway has acceptable sensitivity and would release resources. Users’ suggestions should guide implementation.","Lois, Noemi; Cook, Jonathan A.; Wang, Ariel; Aldington, Stephen; Mistry, Hema; Maredza, Mandy; McAuley, Danny; Aslam, Tariq; Bailey, Clare; Chong, Victor; Ganchi, Faruque; Scanlon, Peter; Sivaprasad, Sobha; Steel, David H.; Styles, Caroline; Azuara-Blanco, Augusto; Prior, Lindsay; Waugh, Norman",Ophthalmology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33130144/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ophtha.2020.10.030,8

In elderly individuals and those with comorbidities, COVID-19 is associated with high mortality, frequently caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome. We examine in situ expression of SARS-CoV-2 in airways and lung obtained at autopsy of individuals with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Seven autopsy cases (male, N = 5; female, N = 2) with reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and a median age of 66 years (range, 50–77 years) were evaluated using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against SARS Nucleocapsid protein in correlation with clinical parameters. The median time from symptom onset to death was 9 days (range, 6–31 days), from hospitalization 7 days (range, 1–21 days), from positive RT-PCR 7 days (range, 0–18 days), and from intensive care unit admission defining onset of respiratory failure 3 days (range, 1–18 days). Chest imaging identified diffuse airspace disease in all patients corresponding to acute and (N = 5) or organizing (N = 2) diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) on histologic examination. Among five patients with acute-phase DAD (≤7 days from onset of respiratory failure), SARS-CoV-2 was detected in pulmonary pneumocytes and ciliated airway cells (N = 5), and in upper airway epithelium (N = 2). In two patients with organizing DAD (>14 days from onset of respiratory failure), no virus was detected in lungs or airways. No endothelial cell infection was observed. The findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection of epithelial cells in lungs and airways of patients with COVID-19 who developed respiratory failure can be detected during the acute phase of lung injury and is absent in the organizing phase.","Schaefer, Inga-Marie; Padera, Robert F.; Solomon, Isaac H.; Kanjilal, Sanjat; Hammer, Mark M.; Hornick, Jason L.; Sholl, Lynette M.",Mod Pathol,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41379-020-0595-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32561849/,8

DESIGN: A literature review of the historical costs of surgical fellowship interviews and a summary of how the shift to virtual interviews has unintended positive and negative effects on costs for applicants and training programs. RESULTS: Transitioning fellowship interviews to virtual platforms affects expenditures of finances and time. Each fellowship candidate saves close to $6,000 in interview travel expenses. Applicants require less time off from their residency programs during this critical time of need for frontline healthcare workers. However, applicants miss some of the live aspects of interviewing, and training programs invest more effort upfront altering their interviews to virtual formats. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 public health crisis has had a significant impact on surgical education, including how selection is conducted. Virtual recruitment has the potential for cost savings but should continue to be refined.

As it spread around the world there has been an unprecedented effort in developing effective vaccines. Computational methods can be used to speed up the long and costly process of vaccine development. Antigen selection, epitope prediction, and toxicity and allergenicity prediction are areas in which computational tools have already been applied as part of reverse vaccinology for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development. However, there is potential for computational methods to assist further. We review approaches which have been used and highlight additional bioinformatic approaches and PK modelling as in silico approaches which may be useful for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design but remain currently unexplored.

It has surprising transmissibility potential, since it could infect all ages, gender, and human sectors. It attacks respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary, hepatic, and endovascular systems and can reach the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) through known and unknown mechanisms. The reports on the neurological manifestations and complications of the SARS‐CoV‐2 infection are increasing exponentially. Herein, we enumerate seven candidate routes, which the mature or immature SARS‐CoV‐2 components could use to reach the CNS and PNS, utilizing the within‐body cross talk between organs. The majority of SARS‐CoV‐2–infected patients suffer from some neurological manifestations (e.g., confusion, anosmia, and ageusia). It seems that although the mature virus did not reach the CNS or PNS of the majority of patients, its unassembled components and/or the accompanying immune‐mediated responses may be responsible for the observed neurological symptoms. The viral particles and/or its components have been specifically documented in endothelial cells of lung, kidney, skin, and CNS. This means that the blood–endothelial barrier may be considered as the main route for SARS‐CoV‐2 entry into the nervous system, with the barrier disruption being more logical than barrier permeability, as evidenced by postmortem analyses.","Uversky, Vladimir N.; Elrashdy, Fatma; Aljadawi, Abdullah; Ali, Syed Moasfar; Khan, Rizwan Hasan; Redwan, Elrashdy M.",J Neurosci Res,https://doi.org/10.1002/jnr.24752; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33217763/,8

The present cross-sectional study investigated adolescents’ feelings about their bodies and perceived changes in weight stigma from peers, parents, and social media during the pandemic. METHODS: Four hundred fifty-two adolescents (11–17 years old) completed an online survey during the Fall of 2020. Measures assessed perceived changes in exposure to weight stigmatizing social media content (stress eating jokes, weight gain memes) and experiences of weight stigma (weight-based bullying, teasing, hurtful comments) by parents and peers, as well as body dissatisfaction, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Weight status and gender were examined as individual difference variables. RESULTS: The majority (53%) of adolescents reported increased exposure to at least one form of weight stigmatizing social media content during the pandemic. Additionally, pandemic-related increases in body dissatisfaction were prevalent (41%), especially among girls with higher body mass index (≥85th percentile; 67%). On average, the extent to which adolescents experienced weight-based mistreatment from parents and peers remained consistent with their pre-pandemic experiences. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, these findings highlight changes in the social messages that adolescents receive about their bodies, as well as their subjective body satisfaction, during the pandemic. Results underscore the need for healthcare providers and mental health professionals to be aware of the potential rise in weight stigma during the pandemic, and encourage families and schools to engage in supportive, rather than stigmatizing, weight-related communication with youth.","Lessard, Leah M; Puhl, Rebecca M",J Pediatr Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34313727/; https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsab071,8

In this study we developed a cell-based high throughput screening (HTS) assay and used it to discover inhibitors against 2-E channels. Among 4376 compounds tested, 34 hits with cell protection activity were found. Followed by an anti-viral analysis, 15 compounds which could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 replication were identified. In electrophysiological experiments, three representatives showing inhibitory effect on 2-E channels were chosen for further characterization. Among them, proanthocyanidins directly bound to 2-E channel with binding affinity (K(D)) of 22.14 μM in surface plasmon resonance assay. Molecular modeling and docking analysis revealed that proanthocyanidins inserted into the pore of 2-E N-terminal vestibule acting as a channel blocker. Consistently, mutations of Glu 8 and Asn 15, two residues lining the proposed binding pocket, abolished the inhibitory effects of proanthocyanidins. The natural product proanthocyanidins are widely used as cosmetic, suggesting a potential of proanthocyanidins as disinfectant for external use.

611116,Outbreak of Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus infection in a group of rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta),2009-06-07,"Regression analysis makes up a large part of supervised machine learning, and consists of the prediction of a continuous independent target from a set of other predictor variables. The difference between binary classification and regression is in the target range: in binary classification, the target can have only two values (usually encoded as 0 and 1), while in regression the target can have multiple values. Even if regression analysis has been employed in a huge number of machine learning studies, no consensus has been reached on a single, unified, standard metric to assess the results of the regression itself. Many studies employ the mean square error (MSE) and its rooted variant (RMSE), or the mean absolute error (MAE) and its percentage variant (MAPE). Although useful, these rates share a common drawback: since their values can range between zero and +infinity, a single value of them does not say much about the performance of the regression with respect to the distribution of the ground truth elements. In this study, we focus on two rates that actually generate a high score only if the majority of the elements of a ground truth group has been correctly predicted: the coefficient of determination (also known as R-squared or R(2)) and the symmetric mean absolute percentage error (SMAPE). After showing their mathematical properties, we report a comparison between R(2) and SMAPE in several use cases and in two real medical scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the coefficient of determination (R-squared) is more informative and truthful than SMAPE, and does not have the interpretability limitations of MSE, RMSE, MAE and MAPE. We therefore suggest the usage of R-squared as standard metric to evaluate regression analyses in any scientific domain.","Chicco, Davide; Warrens, Matthijs J.; Jurman, Giuseppe",PeerJ Comput Sci,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.623; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34307865/,8

The aim of the present study was to investigate the predictive accuracy of a prognostic model for forecasting the development of the cumulative number of reported SARS-CoV-2 cases in countries and administrative regions worldwide until the end of May 2020. METHODS: The cumulative number of reported SARS-CoV-2 cases was forecasted in 251 regions with a horizon of two weeks, one month, and two months using a hierarchical logistic model at the end of March 2020. Forecasts were compared to actual observations by using a series of evaluation metrics. RESULTS: On average, predictive accuracy was very high in nearly all regions at the two weeks forecast, high in most regions at the one month forecast, and notable in the majority of the regions at the two months forecast. Higher accuracy was associated with the availability of more data for estimation and with a more pronounced cumulative case growth from the first case to the date of estimation. In some strongly affected regions, cumulative case counts were considerably underestimated. CONCLUSIONS: With keeping its limitations in mind, the investigated model may be used for the preparation and distribution of resources during the initial phase of epidemics. Future research should primarily address the model’s assumptions and its scope of applicability. In addition, establishing a relationship with known mechanisms and traditional epidemiological models of disease transmission would be desirable.","Kriston, Levente",BMC Med Res Methodol,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-01160-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33198633/,8

The outbreak containment strategies in China based on non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) appear to be effective(2), but quantitative research is still needed to assess the efficacy of NPIs and their timings(3). Using epidemiological and anonymised human movement data(4,5), here we develop a modelling framework that uses daily travel networks to simulate different outbreak and intervention scenarios across China. We estimated that there were a total of 114,325 COVID-19 cases (interquartile range 76,776 -164,576) in mainland China as of February 29, 2020. Without NPIs, the COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (interquartile range 44 - 94) by February 29, 2020, with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to have prevented more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but combined NPIs achieved the strongest and most rapid effect. The lifting of travel restrictions since February 17, 2020 does not appear to lead to an increase in cases across China if the social distancing interventions can be maintained, even at a limited level of 25% reduction on average through late April. Our findings contribute to an improved understanding of NPIs on COVID-19 and to inform response efforts across the World.","Lai, Shengjie; Ruktanonchai, Nick W; Zhou, Liangcai; Prosper, Olivia; Luo, Wei; Floyd, Jessica R; Wesolowski, Amy; Santillana, Mauricio; Zhang, Chi; Du, Xiangjun; Yu, Hongjie; Tatem, Andrew J",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2293-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32365354/,8

In order to improve the outcomes, early diagnosis is crucial, ideally by applying non-invasive and specific biomarkers. A key role in this field is played by extracellular vesicles (EVs), lipid bilayer-delimited structures shed from the surface of almost all cell types, including cancer cells. Subcellular structures contained in EVs such as nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids can be isolated and exploited as biomarkers, since they directly stem from parental cells. Furthermore, it is becoming even more evident that different body fluids can also serve as sources of EVs for diagnostic purposes. In this review, EV isolation and characterization methods are described. Moreover, the potential contribution of EV cargo for diagnostic discovery purposes is described for each tumor.","Testa, Anna; Venturelli, Emilio; Brizzi, Maria Felice",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms22168430; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34445131/,8

The positivity rates in hospitals that do not receive patients with COVID-19, such as the National Cancer Institute (INCan) in Mexico, and the associated factors are unknown. OBJECTIVE: : To assess the incidence and factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in health workers at INCan. METHODS: : A cohort study of 531 workers who were followed for 6 months. RT-PCR analysis of saliva and nasopharyngeal swab samples were used in the baseline and to confirm cases during follow-up The incidence rate ratio was calculated according to the measured characteristics and the associated factors were calculated using logistic regression models. RESULTS: : Out of 531 workers, 9.6% tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, Being male (RR: 2.07, 95% CI: 1.1-3.8, p=0.02), performing administrative tasks (RR: 1.99, 95% CI: 1.0-3.9, p=0.04), and having relatives also working at INCan (RR: 3.7, 95% CI: 1.4-9.5, p<0.01) were associated with higher positivity rates. DISCUSSION: : Incidence of positive cases in health workers were similar to that reported in non-COVID hospitals from other countries.

Global health is unique in the opportunities it can offer to students during the pandemic if programs can manage and learn from the pandemic’s many challenges. Global health educators can: shift to sustainable remote engagement and mobilize resources globally to facilitate this; collaborate with partners to support the efforts to deal with the current pandemic and to prepare for its next phases; partner in new ways with health care professional students and faculty from other countries; collaborate in research with partners in studies of pandemic related health disparities in any country; and document and examine the impact of the pandemic on health care workers and students in different global contexts. These strategies can help work around pandemic travel restrictions, overcome the limitations of existing inequitable models of engagement, and better position global health education and face future challenges while providing the needed support to LMIC partners to participate more equally.","Weine, Stevan; Bosland, Maarten; Rao, Chandrika; Edison, Marcia; Ansong, Daniel; Chamberlain, Stacey; Binagwaho, Agnes",Annals of global health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33598410/; https://doi.org/10.5334/aogh.3088,8

The review aimed to summarize advances in the topic of endocrine diseases and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods. Scientific and institutional websites and databases were searched and data were collected and organized, when plausible, to angle the discussion toward the following clinical issues. (1) Are patients with COVID-19 at higher risk of developing acute or late-onset endocrine diseases or dysfunction? (2) May the underlying endocrine diseases or dysfunctions be considered risk factors for poor prognosis once the infection has occurred? (3) Are there defined strategies to manage endocrine diseases despite pandemic-related constraints? Herein, the authors considered only relevant and more frequently observed endocrine diseases and disorders related to the hypothalamic-pituitary region, thyroid and parathyroid glands, calcium-phosphorus homeostasis and osteoporosis, adrenal glands, and gonads. Main. Data highlight the basis of some pathophysiological mechanisms and anatomical alterations of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-induced endocrine dysfunctions. Some conditions, such as adrenal insufficiency and cortisol excess, may be risk factors of worse clinical progression once the infection has occurred. These at-risk populations may require adequate education to avoid the SARS-CoV-2 infection and adequately manage medical therapy during the pandemic, even in emergencies. Endocrine disease management underwent a palpable restraint, especially procedures requiring obligate access to healthcare facilities for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

Anatomist and medical professionals considered cadaver dissection as the gold standard for teaching and learning anatomy in detail. The increase seen in the establishment of new medical training institutions globally has consequently led to a proportionate increase in the sourcing for cadavers. Moreover, the surge in mortality rates following the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic with no cure or approved vaccine has been a source of concern for academia, especially on the safety in the usage of cadavers for dissection. Notwithstanding, several countries continue to depend on unclaimed bodies as the primary source for cadavers, regardless of the cause of death.

STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING We updated a systematic review on evidence-based approaches and searched databases through May 2020 for evaluation of strategies for policymakers. RESULTS The 201 identified studies evaluated reducing demand for healthcare, optimizing existing resources, augmenting resources, and adopting crisis standards of care. Most research exists to reduce demand (n=149); 39 higher quality studies reported benefits of contact tracing, school closures, travel restrictions, and mass vaccination. Of 28 strategies to augment resources, 6 higher quality studies reported effectiveness of establishing temporary facilities, use of volunteers, and decision support software. Of 23 strategies to optimize existing resources, 12 higher quality studies reported successful scope of work expansions and building on existing interagency agreements. Of 15 COVID-19 studies, 4 higher quality studies evaluated combinations of policies and one reported benefits of community-wide mask policies. CONCLUSION Despite the volume, the evidence base is limited; few strategies were empirically tested in robust study designs.

A critical need exists to perform head-to-head comparisons of these assays. The performances of 15 different lateral flow POCTs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies were compared on a well-characterized set of 100 samples. Of these, 40 samples from known SARS-CoV-2-infected, convalescent individuals (collected an average of 45 days after symptom onset) were used to assess sensitivity. Sixty samples from the prepandemic era (negative control) that were known to represent infections with other respiratory viruses (rhinoviruses A, B, and C and/or coronavirus 229E, HKU1, and NL63 OC43) were used to assess specificity. The timing of seroconversion was assessed using five lateral flow assays (LFAs) and a panel of 272 longitudinal samples from 47 patients for whom the time since symptom onset was known. Among the assays that were evaluated, the sensitivity and specificity for any reactive band ranged from 55% to 97% and from 78% to 100%, respectively. Assessing the performance of the IgM and the IgG bands alone, sensitivity and specificity ranged from 0% to 88% and 80% to 100% for IgM and from 25% to 95% and 90% to 100% for IgG, respectively. Longitudinal testing revealed that the median times after symptom onset to a positive result were 7 days (interquartile range [IQR], 5.4 to 9.8) for IgM and 8.2 days (IQR, 6.3 to 11.3) for IgG. The testing performances differed widely among LFAs, with greatest amount of variation related to the sensitivity of the assays. The IgM band was the band most likely to misclassify prepandemic samples. The appearances of IgM and IgG bands occurred almost simultaneously.","Conklin, Steven E.; Martin, Kathryn; Manabe, Yukari C.; Schmidt, Haley A.; Miller, Jernelle; Keruly, Morgan; Klock, Ethan; Kirby, Charles S.; Baker, Owen R.; Fernandez, Reinaldo E.; Eby, Yolanda J.; Hardick, Justin; Shaw-Saliba, Kathryn; Rothman, Richard E.; Caturegli, Patrizio P.; Redd, Andrew D.; Tobian, Aaron A.

To date, not much is known about the outcomes of acute surgical diseases in this scenario. The aim of this multicenter observational study is to explore the effects of COVID-19 outbreak on the outcomes of patients who underwent surgery for peritonitis. Patients undergoing surgery for secondary peritonitis during the first COVID-19 surge in Italy (March 23–May 4, 2020—COVID period group) were compared with patients who underwent surgery during the same time interval of year 2019 (no-COVID period group). The primary endpoint was the development of postoperative complications. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify predictors of complications. Of the 332 patients studied, 149 were in the COVID period group and 183 were in the no-COVID period group. Patients in the COVID period group had an increased frequency of late presentations to the emergency departments (43% vs. 31.1%; P = 0.026) and a higher rate of postoperative complications (35.6% vs. 18%; P < 0.001). The same results were found in the subset analysis of patients with severe peritonitis at surgical exploration. The ASA score, severity of peritonitis, qSOFA score, diagnosis other than appendicitis, and COVID period resulted independent predictors of complications. During the COVID-19 pandemic patients with peritonitis had a higher rate of complicated postoperative courses, weighing on hospital costs and assistance efforts already pressured by the ongoing sanitary crisis.","Fallani, Guido; Lombardi, Raffaele; Masetti, Michele; Chisari, Mario; Zanini, Nicola; Cattaneo, Gaetano M.; Filosa, Mauro; Zanzi, Federico; Guerra, Enrico; Bonilauri, Stefano; Di Donato, Luca; Garulli, Gianluca; Lucchi, Andrea; Grassia, Michele; Ugolini, Giampaolo; Pasini, Francesco; Vetrone, Gaetano; Benini, Claudia; Nicosia, Simone; Jovine, Elio",Updates Surg,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13304-020-00943-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33394354/,8

In this manuscript we have described a few nuances of the technique still not properly described in the literature: the presence of three colors clusters; the correlation of the viral load with the color change; and the importance of using an internal control to avoid false-negative results. METHODS: To achieve these findings, we performed colorimetric RT-LAMP assays of 466 SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR validated clinical samples, with color quantification measured at 434 nm and 560 nm. RESULTS: First we determinate a sensitivity of 93.8% and specificity of 90.4%. In addition to the pink (negative) and yellow (positive) produced colors, we report for the first time the presence of an orange color cluster that may lead to wrong diagnosis. We also demonstrated using RT-qPCR and RT-LAMP that low viral loads are related to Ct values > 30, resulting in orange colors. We also demonstrated that the diagnosis of COVID-19 by colorimetric RT-LAMP is efficient until the fifth symptoms day when the viral load is still relatively high. CONCLUSION: This study reports properties and indications for colorimetric RT-LAMP as point-of-care for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic, reducing false results, interpretations and optimizing molecular diagnostics tests application.

An effective response to this pandemic requires health care workers (HCWs) to be present at work, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where they are already in critically low supply. To inform whether and to what degree policymakers in Bangladesh, and LMICs more broadly, should expect a drop in HCW attendance as COVID-19 continues to spread, this study aims to determine how HCW attendance has changed during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Bangladesh. METHODS: This study analyzed daily fingerprint-verified attendance data from all 527 public-sector secondary and tertiary care facilities in Bangladesh to describe HCW attendance from January 26, 2019 to March 22, 2020, by cadre, hospital type, and geographic division. We then regressed HCW attendance onto fixed effects for day-of-week, month, and hospital, as well as indicators for each of three pandemic periods: a China-focused period (January 11, 2020 (first confirmed COVID-19 death in China) until January 29, 2020), international-spread period (January 30, 2020 (World Health Organization’s declaration of a global emergency) until March 6, 2020), and local-spread period (March 7, 2020 (first confirmed COVID-19 case in Bangladesh) until the end of the study period). FINDINGS: On average between January 26, 2019 and March 22, 2020, 34.1% of doctors, 64.6% of nurses, and 70.6% of other health care staff were present for their scheduled shift. HCWs’ attendance rate increased with time in 2019 among all cadres. Nurses’ attendance level dropped by 2.5% points (95% confidence interval (CI) = -3.2% to -1.8%) and 3.5% points (95% CI = -4.5% to -2.5%) during the international-spread and the local-spread periods of the COVID-19 pandemic, relative to the China-focused period. Similarly, the attendance level of other health care staff declined by 0.3% points (95% CI = -0.8% to 0.2%) and 2.3% points (95% CI = -3.0% to -1.6%) during the international-spread and local-spread periods, respectively. Among doctors, however, the international-spread and local-spread periods were associated with a statistically significant increase in attendance by 3.7% points (95% CI = 2.5% to 4.8%) and 4.9% points (95% CI = 3.5% to 6.4%), respectively. The reduction in attendance levels across all HCWs during the local-spread period was much greater at large hospitals, where the majority of COVID-19 testing and treatment took place, than that at small hospitals. CONCLUSIONS: After a year of significant improvements, HCWs’ attendance levels among nurses and other health care staff (who form the majority of Bangladesh’s health care workforce) have declined during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This finding may portend an even greater decrease in attendance if COVID-19 continues to spread in Bangladesh. Policymakers in Bangladesh and similar LMICs should undertake major efforts to achieve high attendance levels among HCWs, particularly nurses, such as by providing sufficient personal protective equipment as well as monetary and non-monetary incentives.","Do, Duy; Sarker, Malabika; Chen, Simiao; Lenjani, Ali; Tikka, Pauli; Bärnighausen, Till; Geldsetzer, Pascal",Journal of global health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33110592/; https://doi.org/10.7189/jogh.10.020509,8

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein mediates viral cellular entry via the ACE2 receptor. The cytoplasmic tail of this spike protein is heavily palmitoylated. Emerging studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 alters lipid metabolism in the lung epithelial cells by modulating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), possibly contributing to lipotoxicity, inflammation and untoward respiratory effects. Disruption of this process may affect palmitoylation of SARS-CoV spike protein and thus infectivity and viral assembly. COVID-19 is also increasingly being recognized as a vascular disease, with several studies noting prominent systemic endothelial dysfunction. The pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction may also be linked to COVID-19-mediated metabolic and inflammatory effects. Herein, exercise will be compared to fenofibrate as a possible therapeutic strategy to bolster resilience against (and help manage recovery from) COVID-19. This paper will explore the hypothesis that exercise may be a useful adjuvant in a setting of COVID-19 management/rehabilitation due to its effects on PPARα and vascular endothelial function.","Heffernan, Kevin S.; Ranadive, Sushant; Jae, Sae Young",Med Hypotheses,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720324853?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110197; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720324853; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33017906/,8

618266,The enigma and implications of brain hemispheric asymmetry in neurodegenerative diseases,2021-09-06,"BACKGROUND: With large numbers of COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation and ventilators possibly being in short supply, in extremis two patients may have to share one ventilator. Careful matching of patient ventilation requirements is necessary. However, good matching is difficult to achieve as lung characteristics can have a wide range and may vary over time. Adding flow restriction to the flow path between ventilator and patient gives the opportunity to control the airway pressure and hence flow and volume individually for each patient. This study aimed to create and validate a simple model for calculating required flow restriction. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We created a simple linear resistance-compliance model, termed the BathRC model, of the ventilator tubing system and lung allowing direct calculation of the relationships between pressures, volumes, and required flow restriction. Experimental measurements were made for parameter determination and validation using a clinical ventilator connected to two test lungs. For validation, differing amounts of restriction were introduced into the ventilator circuit. The BathRC model was able to predict tidal lung volumes with a mean error of 4% (min:1.2%, max:9.3%). CONCLUSION: We present a simple model validated model that can be used to estimate required flow restriction for dual patient ventilation. The BathRC model is freely available; this tool is provided to demonstrate that flow restriction can be readily estimated.

Patients and methods: We performed an observational retrospective and monocentric study in a ship. Role 1 was reinforced by additional roles 1 and 2. Our analysis included all infected crew personnel. We described demographic data, outbreak course, and biological samples including Covid-19 diagnosis. All infected patients were monitored for 10 days. Results: Between February 16th 2021 and March 12th 2021, 54 patients (10% of the entire crew) were included. No patient had previously been vaccinated against SARS Cov2. The global mission was maintained. The crew members were healthy, male, and young (median age 28 years) with no medical history. Ranks of every status were concerned. Covid-19 disease was mainly diagnosed by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rt-PCR). Thirty-two patients (59%) were symptomatic, four (8%) were presymptomatic and 18 (33%) remained asymptomatic. Conclusions: The present work describes specific SARS Cov2 outbreak management in an austere military environment. Early individual and global measures were set and implemented on board.","Schmitt, Johan; Genet, Emmanuel; Deserts, Marc Danguy Des; Chauvet-Atin, Sophie; Cungi, Pierre-Julien; Aries, Philippe; Giacardi, Christophe; Vellieux, Sophie",Infect Dis Now,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34157429/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S266699192100419X; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266699192100419X?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idnow.2021.06.303,8
618799,Clinical applications for exosomes: Are we there yet?,2021-05-03,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The reduced fucosylation in the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 and the IgG antibody has been observed in COVID-19. However, the clinical relevance of α-l-fucosidase, the enzyme for defucosylation has not been discovered. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 585 COVID-19 patients were included to analyze the correlations of α-l-fucosidase activity with the nucleic acid test, IgM/IgG, comorbidities, and disease progression. RESULTS: Among the COVID-19 patients, 5.75% were double-negative for nucleic acid and antibodies. All of them had increased α-l-fucosidase, while only one had abnormal serum amyloid A (SAA) and C-reactive protein (CRP). The abnormal rate of α-l-fucosidase was 81.82% before the presence of IgM, 100% in the presence of IgM, and 66.2% in the presence of IgG. 73.42% of patients with glucometabolic disorders had increased α-l-fucosidase activity and had the highest mortality of 6.33%. The increased α-l-fucosidase was observed in 55.8% of non-severe cases and 72.9% of severe cases, with an odds ratio of 2.118. The α-l-fucosidase mRNA was irrelevant to its serum activity. CONCLUSION: The change in α-l-fucosidase activity in COVID-19 preceded the IgM and SAA and showed a preferable relation with glucometabolic disorders, which may be conducive to virus invasion or invoke an immune response against SARS-CoV-2.","Liang, En-yu; Li, Guo-hua; Wang, Wen-gong; Qiu, Xin-min; Ke, Pei-feng; He, Min; Huang, Xian-zhang",Clin Chim Acta,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cca.2021.03.031; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009898121001169?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33826953/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009898121001169,8

(Menispermaceae): A Review on Traditional Uses, Phytochemistry and Pharmacological Activities",2020-11-10,"The nucleocapsid phosphoprotein N plays critical roles in multiple processes of the SARS-CoV-2 infection cycle: it protects and packages viral RNA in nucleocapsid assembly, interacts with the inner domain of spike protein in virion assembly, binds to structural membrane protein M during virion packaging and maturation, and binds to proteases causing replication of infective virus particle. Even with its importance, very limited biophysical studies are available on the N protein because of its high level of disorder, high propensity for aggregation and high susceptibility for autoproteolysis. Here we successfully prepare the N protein and a 1000 nucleotide fragment of viral RNA in large quantities and purity suitable for biophysical studies. A combination of biophysical and biochemical techniques demonstrates that the N protein is partially disordered and consists of an independently folded RNA binding domain and a dimerization domain, flanked by disordered linkers. The protein assembles as a tight dimer with a dimerization constant of sub micro molar, but can also form transient interactions with other N proteins facilitating larger oligomers. NMR studies on the ∼100kDa dimeric protein identify a specific domain that binds 1-1000 RNA and show that the N/RNA complex remains highly disordered. Analytical ultracentrifugation, isothermal titration calorimetry, multi-angle light scattering, and cross-linking experiments identify a heterogeneous mixture of complexes with a core corresponding to at least 70 dimers of N bound to 1-1000 RNA. In contrast, very weak binding is detected with a smaller construct corresponding to the RNA binding domain using similar experiments. A model that explains the importance of the bivalent structure of N to its binding on multivalent sites of the viral RNA is presented.","Forsythe, Heather M.; Galvan, Joaquin Rodriguez; Yu, Zhen; Pinckney, Seth; Reardon, Patrick; Cooley, Richard B.; Zhu, Phillip; Rolland, Amber D.; Prell, James S.; Barbar, Elisar",Biophys J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33794152/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bpj.2021.03.023; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349521002538?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006349521002538,8

621899,Autoimmune and inflammatory diseases following COVID-19,2020-06-04,"SIMPLE SUMMARY: Group-housing of gestating sows is becoming increasingly common worldwide as it offers the sows the opportunity to exercise, display exploratory behaviors, and develop social relationships. Despite its advantages, group-housing as it stands in modern industries also presents several welfare issues such as overt aggression between pen-mates and resulting stress and injuries. To date, breeding companies often largely focused their efforts on genetic selection based on individual production characteristics (e.g., litter size, piglets’ growth, and meat quality) and traditionally ignored the social behaviors and the ability to establish a dominance hierarchy without exacerbated aggression. Hence, the extent to which agonistic behavior differs according to new genetic lines is unknown. The objective of this study was to compare and investigate the influence of two genetic lines on the welfare and performance of sows housed in large semi-static groups (up to 91 animals). While the first genetic line was more aggressive toward pen-mates during gestation, the second had piglets with a lower robustness and survivability. This study raises the difficulty of finding an optimal genetic line, including both positive welfare and productivity outcomes, and points to the urgent need of considering social aspects when developing genetic lines for group-housing. ABSTRACT: Confinement of gestating sows is becoming banished in favor of group-housing in countries worldwide, forcing breeding companies to develop genetic lines adapted for social living. This study aimed at assessing the influence of two genetic lines selected for high performance (HP1, HP2, derived from Landrace × Yorkshire) on welfare and reproductive performance of sows housed in large semi-static groups (20 groups of 46–91 animals) across several parities. To address this, agonistic behaviors were recorded on d0, d2, d27, and d29 post-mixing while body lesions were scored on d1, d26, and d84. Sows’ individual and reproductive performances were also recorded. HP2 sows were more aggressive than HP1 sows since they fought (p = 0.028) and bullied (p = 0.0009) pen-mates more frequently on d0–d2. HP2 sows had more total body lesions throughout gestation than HP1 sows at higher parities (p < 0.0001). Regarding reproductive performance, HP2 sows lost less piglets (p < 0.0001) and tended to wean more piglets (p = 0.067) than HP1 sows. In conclusion, while HP2 sows were the most aggressive, HP1 sows had piglets with lower survivability, which raises ethical issues in both cases and points to the need of considering social aspects when developing genetic lines for group-housing.","Brajon, Sophie; Ahloy-Dallaire, Jamie; Devillers, Nicolas; Guay, Frédéric",Animals (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33291805/; https://doi.org/10.3390/ani10122299,8

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate patient baseline characteristics and utilization patterns for short-acting G-CSF products with particular focus on the assessment of filgrastim biosimilar usage relative to the originator product. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined filgrastim, filgrastim-sndz, and tbo-filgrastim use among adult patients between January 2012 and March 2019 across the five health-plan research partners in the BBCIC Distributed Research Network. The publicly available Sentinel System analytic toolkit was used to perform the distributed analyses. RESULTS: We evaluated over 38 million eligible health-plan members representing more than 88 million person-years of data. We identified 45,204 incident treatment episodes, including 33,118 episodes with filgrastim, 6525 episodes with filgrastim-sndz, and 5,561 episodes with tbo-filgrastim. We observed that the demographic and clinical characteristics of users were comparable across products. While total use of all filgrastim products remained consistent, the proportion of incident episodes of the originator filgrastim steadily decreased since 2014, with filgrastim-sndz and tbo-filgrastim making up the difference. Utilization for the G-CSF biosimilar, filgrastim-sndz, increased from 40 (1%) of 6823 total filgrastim product episodes in 2015, to 2486 (44%) of a total 5668 episodes of filgrastim products in 2018 (partial data for 2018). CONCLUSION: New episodes of short-acting biosimilar filgrastim products have increased over time while the overall number of new users remained flat.

623704,How COVID-19 disrupts glycometabolic control,2021-06-14,"BACKGROUND: Multimorbidity, the presence of two or more mental or physical chronic non-communicable diseases, is a major challenge for the health system in China, which faces unprecedented ageing of its population. Here we examined the distribution of physical multimorbidity in relation to socioeconomic status; the association between physical multimorbidity, health-care service use, and catastrophic health expenditures; and whether these associations varied by socioeconomic group and social health insurance schemes. METHODS: In this population-based, panel data analysis, we used data from three waves of the nationally representative China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) for 2011, 2013, and 2015. We included participants aged 50 years and older in 2015, who had complete follow-up for the three waves. We used 11 physical non-communicable diseases to measure physical multimorbidity and annual per-capita household consumption spending as a proxy for socioeconomic status. FINDINGS: Of 17 708 participants in CHARLS, 11 817 were eligible for inclusion in our analysis. The median age of participants was 62 years (IQR 56–69) in 2015, and 5766 (48·8%) participants were male. 7320 (61·9%) eligible participants had physical multimorbidity in China in 2015. The prevalence of physical multimorbidity was increased with older age (odds ratio 2·93, 95% CI 2·71–3·15), among women (2·70, 2·04–3·57), within a higher socioeconomic group (for quartile 4 [highest group] 1·50, 1·24–1·82), and higher educational level (5·17, 3·02–8·83); however, physical multimorbidity was more common in poorer regions than in the more affluent regions. An additional chronic non-communicable disease was associated with an increase in the number of outpatient visits (incidence rate ratio 1·29, 95% CI 1·27–1·31), and number of days spent in hospital as an inpatient (1·38, 1·35–1·41). We saw similar effects in health service use of an additional chronic non-communicable disease in different socioeconomic groups and among those covered by different social health insurance programmes. Overall, physical multimorbidity was associated with a significantly increased likelihood of catastrophic health expenditure (for the overall population: odds ratio 1·29, 95% CI 1·26–1·32, adjusted for sociodemographic variables). The effect of physical multimorbidity on catastrophic health expenditures persisted even among the higher socioeconomic groups and across all health insurance programmes. INTERPRETATION: Concerted efforts are needed to reduce health inequalities that are due to physical multimorbidity, and its adverse economic effect in population groups in China. Social health insurance reforms must place emphasis on reducing out-of-pocket spending for patients with multimorbidity to provide greater financial risk protection.

The ORF8 of SARS-CoV-2 has been suggested to be associated with the symptoms of COVID-19, according to reports of clinical studies. However, little is known about the function of ORF8. As one of the ways to advance the functional analysis of ORF8, mass production of ORF8 with the correct three-dimensional structure is necessary. In this study, we attempted to produce ORF8 protein by chemically inducible protein production system using tobacco BY-2 cells. An ORF8-producing line was generated by the Agrobacterium method. As a result, the production of ORF8 of 8.8 ± 1.4 mg/L of culture medium was confirmed. SDS-PAGE and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis confirmed that the ORF8 produced by this system is a dimeric form with a single structure, unlike that produced in Escherichia coli. Furthermore, it was suggested that the ORF8 produced by this system was glycosylated. Through this study, we succeeded in producing ORF8 folded into a single structure in a chemically inducible protein production system using tobacco BY-2 cells. It is expected that the functional analysis of ORF8 will be advanced using the ORF8 produced by this system and that it will greatly contribute to the development of antibodies and therapeutic agents targeting ORF8.","Imamura, Tomohiro; Isozumi, Noriyoshi; Higashimura, Yasuki; Ohki, Shinya; Mori, Masashi",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.07.325910,8

It is therefore important to evaluate associated cognitive factors. We aimed to obtain first endorsement rate estimates of coronavirus-related conspiracy beliefs in a German-speaking general population sample and investigate whether delusion-related reasoning biases and paranoid ideation are associated with such beliefs. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional non-probability online study, quota-sampled for age and gender, with 1684 adults from Germany and German-speaking Switzerland. We assessed general and specific coronavirus conspiracy beliefs, reasoning biases [jumping-to-conclusions bias (JTC), liberal acceptance bias (LA), bias against disconfirmatory evidence (BADE), possibility of being mistaken (PM)], and paranoid ideation, using established experimental paradigms and self-report questionnaires. RESULTS: Around 10% of our sample endorsed coronavirus-related CT beliefs at least strongly, and another 20% to some degree. Overall endorsement was similar to levels observed in a UK-based study (Freeman et al., 2020b). Higher levels of conspiracy belief endorsement were associated with greater JTC, greater LA, greater BADE, higher PM, and greater paranoid ideation. Associations were mostly small to moderate and best described by non-linear relationships. CONCLUSIONS: A noticeable proportion of our sample recruited in Germany and German-speaking Switzerland endorsed coronavirus conspiracy beliefs strongly or to some degree. These beliefs are associated with reasoning biases studied in delusion research. The non-probability sampling approach limits the generalizability of findings. Future longitudinal and experimental studies investigating conspiracy beliefs along the lines of reasoning are encouraged to validate reasoning aberrations as risk factors.","Kuhn, Sarah Anne Kezia; Lieb, Roselind; Freeman, Daniel; Andreou, Christina; Zander-Schellenberg, Thea",Psychological medicine,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291721001124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33722315/,8

Researchers have increased their efforts in the development of antiviral agents against coronavirus targeting M(pro) protein (main protease) as an effective drug target. The present study explores the inhibitory potential of characteristic and non-characteristic Withania somnifera (Indian ginseng) phytochemicals (n ≈ 100) against SARS-Cov-2 M(pro) protein. Molecular docking studies revealed that certain W. somnifera compounds exhibit superior binding potential (−6.16 to −12.27 kcal/mol) compared to the standard inhibitors (−2.55 to −6.16 kcal/mol) including nelfinavir and lopinavir. The non-characteristic compounds (quercetin-3-rutinoside-7-glucoside, rutin and isochlorogenic acid B) exhibited higher inhibitory potential in comparison to characteristic W. somnifera compounds withanolide and withanone. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies of the complex for 100 ns confirm favorable and stable binding of the lead molecule. The MMPBSA calculation of the last 10 ns of the protein-ligand complex trajectory exhibited stable binding of quercetin-3-rutinoside-7-glucoside at the active site of SARS-Cov-2 M(pro). Taken together, the study demonstrates that the non-characteristic compounds present in W. somnifera possess enhanced potential to bind SARS-Cov-2 M(pro) active site.

630771,Flu vaccination shortly after MI reduces the risk of complications,2021-09-10,"Abstract As bioenergy produces neutral or even negative carbon emissions, the assessment of biomass resources and associated emissions mitigation is a key step toward a low carbon future. However, relevant comprehensive estimates lack in China. Here, we measure the energy potential of China's domestic biomass resources (including crop residues, forest residues, animal manure, municipal solid waste and sewage sludge) from 2000 to 2016 and draw the spatial-temporal variation trajectories at provincial resolution. Scenario analysis and life cycle assessment are also applied to discuss the greenhouse gas mitigation potentials. Results show that the collectable potential of domestic biomass resources increased from 18.31 EJ in 2000 to 22.67 EJ in 2016 with overall uncertainties fluctuating between (−26.6%, 39.7%) and (−27.6%, 39.5%). Taking energy crops into account, the total potential in 2016 (32.69 EJ) was equivalent to 27.6% of China's energy consumption. If this potential can be realized in a planned way to displace fossil fuels during the period 2020–2050, cumulative greenhouse gas emissions mitigation would be in the range of 1652.73–5859.56 Mt CO2-equivalent, in which the negative greenhouse gas emissions due to the introduction of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage would account for 923.78–1344.13 Mt CO2-equivalent. Contrary to increasing bioenergy potentials in most provinces, there are declining trends in Tibet, Beijing, Shanghai and Zhejiang. In addition, Yunnan, Sichuan and Inner Mongolia would have the highest associated greenhouse gas mitigation potentials. This study can provide valuable guidance on the exploitation of China's untapped biomass resources for the mitigation of global climate change.","Kang, Yating; Yang, Qing; Bartocci, Pietro; Wei, Hongjian; Liu, Sylvia Shuhan; Wu, Zhujuan; Zhou, Hewen; Yang, Haiping; Fantozzi, Francesco; Chen, Hanping",Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2020.109842; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032120301362; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34234613/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1364032120301362,8

METHODS: Data on COVID‐19 prevalence and mortality, country‐specific governmental actions, socioeconomic, demographic, and healthcare capacity factors were extracted from publicly available sources. Multivariable negative binomial regression was used to assess the independent association of obesity with COVID‐19 case and mortality rates. RESULTS: Across 168 countries for which data were available, higher obesity prevalence was associated with increased COVID‐19 mortality and prevalence rates. For every 1% increase in obesity prevalence, the mortality rate was increased by 8.3% (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1.083, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.048‐1.119; P < 0.001) and the case rate was higher by 6.6% (IRR 1.066, 95% CI 1.035‐1.099; P < 0.001). Additionally, higher median population age, greater female ratio, higher Human Development Index (HDI), lower population density, and lower hospital bed availability were all significantly associated with higher COVID‐19 mortality rate. In addition, stricter governmental actions, higher HDI and lower mean annual temperature were significantly associated with higher COVID‐19 case rate.

A total of 459 children (8.4 ± 0.4 years old, 50.54% males) from 15 schools in Granada (Spain) participated in the study. A tri-axial accelerometer was used to measure PA levels in the children for 7 consecutive days. The Revidierter KINDer Lebensqualitätsfragebogen (KINDL-R) questionnaire was used to determine the children’s HRQoL dimensions. The results showed that males presented more minutes engaged in MVPA than females. Both sedentary time and PA levels were associated with self-esteem and total score (all p < 0.05). In males, moderate and vigorous PA levels were associated with higher HRQoL, whereas light PA was associated with higher HRQoL in females. Future studies should take into account the use of activities with difference intensities in order to increase HRQoL in males and females.","Ávila-García, Manuel; Esojo-Rivas, María; Villa-González, Emilio; Tercedor, Pablo; Huertas-Delgado, Francisco Javier",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18052702; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33800169/,8

Does paediatric CF home spirometry require physiologist supervision?,2021,"In a pandemic with a novel disease, disease-specific prognosis models are available only with a delay. To bridge the critical early phase, models built for similar diseases might be applied. To test the accuracy of such a knowledge transfer, we investigated how precise lethal courses in critically ill COVID-19 patients can be predicted by a model trained on critically ill non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia patients. We trained gradient boosted decision tree models on 718 (245 deceased) non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia patients to predict individual ICU mortality and applied it to 1054 (369 deceased) COVID-19 patients. Our model showed a significantly better predictive performance (AUROC 0.86 [95% CI 0.86–0.87]) than the clinical scores APACHE2 (0.63 [95% CI 0.61–0.65]), SAPS2 (0.72 [95% CI 0.71–0.74]) and SOFA (0.76 [95% CI 0.75–0.77]), the COVID-19-specific mortality prediction models of Zhou (0.76 [95% CI 0.73–0.78]) and Wang (laboratory: 0.62 [95% CI 0.59–0.65]; clinical: 0.56 [95% CI 0.55–0.58]) and the 4C COVID-19 Mortality score (0.71 [95% CI 0.70–0.72]). We conclude that lethal courses in critically ill COVID-19 patients can be predicted by a machine learning model trained on non-COVID-19 patients. Our results suggest that in a pandemic with a novel disease, prognosis models built for similar diseases can be applied, even when the diseases differ in time courses and in rates of critical and lethal courses.","Lichtner, Gregor; Balzer, Felix; Haufe, Stefan; Giesa, Niklas; Schiefenhövel, Fridtjof; Schmieding, Malte; Jurth, Carlo; Kopp, Wolfgang; Akalin, Altuna; Schaller, Stefan J.; Weber-Carstens, Steffen; Spies, Claudia; von Dincklage, Falk",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34168198/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-92475-7,8

The Austrian government implemented a lockdown on 16 March to contain further spread of the disease. We investigated the effects of lockdown on acute upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in Austria. Methods We contacted 98 Austrian hospitals performing emergency endoscopies. The hospitals were asked to report upper GI endoscopies performed for recent hematemesis, melena, or both, and exhibiting endoscopically visible signs of bleeding. The study period was from 3 weeks before (calendar Week 9) to 3 weeks after (Week 14) initiation of the lockdown. Results 61 % of Austrian hospitals, and importantly all major state hospitals, responded. A total of 575 upper GI bleedings occurred during the 3 weeks before and 341 during the 3 weeks after initiation of lockdown (40.7 % reduction). There was a 54.6 % decline in nonvariceal bleeding events at Week 14 compared with Week 9 (89 vs. 196), whereas rates of variceal hemorrhage did not change (15 vs. 17).

632505,Metabolomics in Radiation Biodosimetry: Current Approaches and Advances,2020-08-11,"Schwannoma is a rare tumor that arises from the Schwann cells, which are specialized, myelin-producing cells of the peripheral nerve sheaths. As anatomic logic would dictate, these masses commonly occur in the skull base, cerebellopontine angle, and posterior spinal roots. Of this already rare entity, rarer still are the pleural schwannomas, representing approximately 1-2% of thoracic tumors. These tumors commonly affect adults with a propensity for the third and sixth decades of life and a comparative male predilection. Schwannomas are benign, indolent, and follow an asymptomatic course. As such, they often come to light incidentally. Here we report a case of primary pleural schwannomas in a 68-year-old female, found incidentally on a CT scan of the chest. To the best of our knowledge and literature review, no other similar case has been reported in our country, Pakistan. Around three weeks before her presentation, she was diagnosed with COVID-19. Her infection had run a mild course with quick recovery without the need for any hospitalization. Therefore, the manifestation of shortness of breath after resolution of all other symptoms prompted a further workup. Radiographic chest x-ray revealed an incidental finding of a large right upper lobe lung mass, slightly impinging on the trachea. This was followed by a chest CT scan at our radiological imaging facility, which showed a large, well-encapsulated, right upper lobe lung mass in the paraspinal apical location. She then underwent an image-guided biopsy of the aforementioned mass, pathological analysis of which was suggestive of a benign peripheral nerve sheath tumor (PNST) arising from the pleura (pleural schwannoma). She underwent right posterolateral thoracotomy with uneventful complete surgical removal of the pleural-based lung mass. Postoperative investigations included a chest x-ray that showed interval complete resection of the mass. Currently, she is asymptomatic and her clinical condition has improved with the successful resumption of her daily routine. Physicians thus need to keep pleural schwannomas in mind as a probable diagnosis of intrathoracic tumors. Indolent and asymptomatic, they are very amenable to surgical resection with little to no chances of recurrence in the long term. However, these patients should be closely followed with repeat imaging studies when symptomatic.","Shoaib, Daania; Zahir, Muhammad N; Khan, Saqib R; Jabbar, Adnan A; Rashid, Yasmin A",Cureus,https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.17511; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34603885/,8

Data on clinical symptoms of pediatric inpatients with COVID‐19 infection were unclear. The aim of study was to investigate the clinical features of pediatric inpatients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched to seek for studies providing details on pediatric inpatients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection which were published from 1‐January‐2020 to 21‐April‐2020. Studies with more than 5 pediatric inpatients were included in our meta‐analysis.This study was registered in the PROSPERO database (CRD42020183550). As the results shown, fever (46%) and cough (42%) were the main clinical characters of pediatric inpatients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and the other clinical characters such as Diarrhea, Vomiting, Nasal congestion, and Fatigue account for 10% in pediatric inpatients. The proportion of asymptomatic cases was 0.42 (95%CI: 0.27‐0.59) and severe cases was 0.03(95%CI: 0.01‐0.06). For the laboratory result, leukopenia (21%) and lymphocytosis (22%) were the mainly indicators for pediatric inpatients, followed by high aspartate aminotransferase(AST) (19%), lymphopenia (16%), high alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (15%), high C‐reactive protein (CPR) (17%), lymphopenia (16%), leukocytosis (13%), high D‐dimer (12%) and high creatine kinase‐MB (CK‐MB)(5%).

We evaluated the prevalence, risk factors, and characteristics of immunocompromised patients coming from the community with pneumonia. METHODS: We conducted a secondary analysis of an international, multicenter study enrolling adult patients coming from the community with pneumonia and hospitalized in 222 hospitals in 54 countries worldwide. Risk factors for immunocompromise included AIDS, aplastic anemia, asplenia, hematological cancer, chemotherapy, neutropenia, biological drug use, lung transplantation, chronic steroid use, and solid tumor. RESULTS: At least 1 risk factor for immunocompromise was recorded in 18% of the 3702 patients enrolled. The prevalences of risk factors significantly differed across continents and countries, with chronic steroid use (45%), hematological cancer (25%), and chemotherapy (22%) the most common. Among immunocompromised patients, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) pathogens were the most frequently identified, and prevalences did not differ from those in immunocompetent patients. Risk factors for immunocompromise were independently associated with neither Pseudomonas aeruginosa nor non–community-acquired bacteria. Specific risk factors were independently associated with fungal infections (odds ratio for AIDS and hematological cancer, 15.10 and 4.65, respectively; both P = .001), mycobacterial infections (AIDS; P = .006), and viral infections other than influenza (hematological cancer, 5.49; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings could be considered by clinicians in prescribing empiric antibiotic therapy for CAP in immunocompromised patients. Patients with AIDS and hematological cancer admitted with CAP may have higher prevalences of fungi, mycobacteria, and noninfluenza viruses.","Di Pasquale, Marta Francesca; Sotgiu, Giovanni; Gramegna, Andrea; Radovanovic, Dejan; Terraneo, Silvia; Reyes, Luis F; Rupp, Jan; González del Castillo, Juan; Blasi, Francesco; Aliberti, Stefano; Restrepo, Marcos I",Clinical Infectious Diseases,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciy723; http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/136778/1/12474_5651482_dipasquale2018.pdf; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31222287/,8

A review,2021-07-09,"To reliably estimate the demand on regional health systems and perform public health planning, it is necessary to have a good estimate of the prevalence of infection with SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) in the population. In the absence of wide-spread testing, we provide one approach to infer prevalence based on the assumption that the fraction of true infections needing hospitalization is fixed and that all hospitalized cases of COVID-19 in Santa Clara are identified. Our goal is to estimate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infections, i.e. the true number of people currently infected with the virus, divided by the total population size. Our analysis suggests that as of March 17, 2020, there are 6,500 infections (0.34% of the population) of SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County. Based on adjusting the parameters of our model to be optimistic (respectively pessimistic), the number of infections would be 1,400 (resp. 26,000), corresponding to a prevalence of 0.08% (resp. 1.36%). If the shelter-in-place led to R0 < 1, we would expect the number of infections to remain about constant for the next few weeks. However, even if this were true, we expect to continue to see an increase in hospitalized cases of COVID-19 in the short term due to the fact that infection of SARS-CoV-2 on March 17th can lead to hospitalizations up to 14 days later.","Yadlowsky, S.; Shah, N.; Steinhardt, J.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.24.20043067; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.03.24.20043067v1?rss=1,8

Rapid antigen detection tests (RADT) are promising candidates for large-scale screenings due to timely results and feasibility for on-site testing. Nonetheless, the diagnostic performance of RADT in detecting infectious individuals is yet to be fully determined. Two combined oro- and nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from individuals at a routine SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic center. Side-by-side evaluations of RT-qPCR and RADT as well as live virus cultures of positive samples were performed to determine the sensitivity of the Standard Q COVID-19 Ag Test (SD Biosensor/Roche) in detecting SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals with cultivable virus. A total of 2,028 samples were tested and 118 virus cultures inoculated. SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in 210 samples by RT-qPCR, representing a positive rate of 10.36%. The Standard Q COVID-19 Ag Test yielded a positive result in 92 (4.54%) samples resulting in an overall sensitivity and specificity of 42.86% and 99.89%. For adjusted Ct values <20, <25, and <30 the RADT reached sensitivities of 100%, 98.15%, and 88.64%, respectively. All 29 culture positive samples were detected by RADT. While overall sensitivity was low, Standard Q COVID-19 RADT reliably detected patients with high RNA loads. Additionally, negative RADT results fully corresponded with the lack of viral cultivability in Vero E6 cells.

XIST-dependent genes lack promoter DNA methylation and require continual XIST-dependent histone deacetylation. XIST RNA-directed proteomics and CRISPRi screen reveal distinctive somatic cell-specific XIST complexes, and identify TRIM28 that mediates Pol II pausing at promoters of X-linked genes in B cells. XIST dysregylation, reflected by escape of XIST-dependent genes, occurs in CD11c+ atypical memory B cells across single-cell transcriptome data in patients with female-biased autoimmunity and COVID-19 infection.

637622,Regional Infectious Disease Surveillance Networks and their Potential to Facilitate the Implementation of the International Health Regulations,2008-11-06,"A novel coronavirus (CoV) has recently been identified as the aetiological agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Nucleocapsid (N) proteins of the Coronaviridae family have no discernable homology, but they share a common nucleolar-cytoplasmic distribution pattern. There are three putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) motifs present in the N. To determine the role of these putative NLSs in the intracellular localization of the SARS–CoV N, we performed a confocal microscopy analysis using rabbit anti-N antisera. In this report, we show that the wild type N was distributed mainly in the cytoplasm. The N-terminal of the N, which contains the NLS1 (aa38–44), was localized to the nucleus. The C-terminus of the N, which contains both NLS2 (aa257–265) and NLS3 (aa369–390) was localized to the cytoplasm and the nucleolus. Results derived from analysis of various deletion mutations show that the region containing amino acids 226–289 is able to mediate nucleolar localization. The deletion of two hydrophobic regions that flanked the NLS3 recovered its activity and localized to the nucleus. Furthermore, deletion of leucine rich region (220-LALLLLDRLNRL) resulted in the accumulation of N to the cytoplasm and nucleolus, and when fusing this peptide to EGFP localization was cytoplasmic, suggesting that the N may act as a shuttle protein. Differences in nuclear/nucleolar localization properties of N from other members of coronavirus family suggest a unique function for N, which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of SARS.","Timani, Khalid Amine; Liao, Qingjiao; Ye, Linbai; Zeng, Yingchun; Liu, Jing; Zheng, Yi; Ye, Li; Yang, Xiaojun; Lingbao, Kong; Gao, Jingrong; Zhu, Ying",Virus Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15992957/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168170205001668; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168170205001668,8

The structure reveals an unusual, nonproductive binding mode of favipiravir-RTP at the catalytic site of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp, which explains its low rate of incorporation into the RNA primer strand. Together, these findings inform current and future efforts to develop polymerase inhibitors for SARS coronaviruses.","Naydenova, Katerina; Muir, Kyle W.; Wu, Long-Fei; Zhang, Ziguo; Coscia, Francesca; Peet, Mathew J.; Castro-Hartmann, Pablo; Qian, Pu; Sader, Kasim; Dent, Kyle; Kimanius, Dari; Sutherland, John D.; Löwe, Jan; Barford, David; Russo, Christopher J.",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2021946118; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33526596/,8

METHODS: Survey data describing Marshallese experiences during the pandemic were analyzed using descriptive statistics and complementary log–log regression to test the association between education and basic needs insecurity. RESULTS: Marshallese respondents reported no usual source of care (46%), less healthcare (22.3%), and difficulty obtaining medication (34.8%). Nearly 80% reported being food insecure, and 47.5% reported being housing insecure. Marshallese with a high school education or less had higher odds of reporting being food and housing insecure. DISCUSSION: Basic needs insecurities are a serious threat to the health of Marshallese during the pandemic. Results from this study can inform interventions addressing food and housing insecurity, access to healthcare, and medication access for Marshallese communities.","Andersen, Jennifer A.; Willis, Don E.; Malhis, Joseph R.; Long, Christopher R.; McElfish, Pearl A.",J Racial Ethn Health Disparities,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34403123/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s40615-021-01125-1,8

The driver of this daily variation can be endogenous circadian rhythms driven by the central and/or peripheral clocks, or exogenous diurnal rhythms driven by behavioural and environmental cycles, which manifest as regular 24 h cycles of metabolite concentrations. This review, of all published studies to date, establishes the extent of daily variation with regard to the number and identity of ‘rhythmic’ metabolites observed in blood, saliva, urine, breath, and skeletal muscle. The probable sources driving such variation, in addition to what metabolite classes are most susceptible in adhering to or uncoupling from such cycles is described in addition to a compiled list of common rhythmic metabolites. The reviewed studies show that the metabolome undergoes significant time of day variation, primarily observed for amino acids and multiple lipid classes. Such 24 h rhythms, driven by various factors discussed herein, are an additional source of intra/inter-individual variation and are thus highly pertinent to all studies applying untargeted and targeted metabolomics platforms, particularly for the construction of biomarker panels. The potential implications are discussed alongside proposed minimum reporting criteria suggested to acknowledge time of day variation as a potential influence of results and to facilitate improved reproducibility.","Hancox, Thomas P.

640069,Innovative highlights of clinical drug trial design,2020-06-03,"The biguanide metformin is the first drug to be tested as a gerotherapeutic in the clinical trial TAME (Targeting Aging with Metformin). The current consensus is that metformin exerts indirect pleiotropy on core metabolic hallmarks of aging, such as the insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 and AMP-activated protein kinase/mammalian Target Of Rapamycin signaling pathways, downstream of its primary inhibitory effect on mitochondrial respiratory complex I. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusive, metformin can exert regulatory effects on components of the biologic machinery of aging itself such as chromatin-modifying enzymes. An integrative metabolo-epigenetic outlook supports a new model whereby metformin operates as a guardian of cell identity, capable of retarding cellular aging by preventing the loss of the information-theoretic nature of the epigenome. The ultimate anti-aging mechanism of metformin might involve the global preservation of the epigenome architecture, thereby ensuring cell fate commitment and phenotypic outcomes despite the challenging effects of aging noise. Metformin might therefore inspire the development of new gerotherapeutics capable of preserving the epigenome architecture for cell identity. Such gerotherapeutics should replicate the ability of metformin to halt the erosion of the epigenetic landscape, mitigate the loss of cell fate commitment, delay stochastic/environmental DNA methylation drifts, and alleviate cellular senescence. Yet, it remains a challenge to confirm if regulatory changes in higher-order genomic organizers can connect the capacity of metformin to dynamically regulate the three-dimensional nature of epigenetic landscapes with the 4th dimension, the aging time.","Menendez, Javier A.",Biomolecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/biom10050780; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32443566/,8

We investigated whether surgeons who perform medical procedures other than abortion also routinely conduct research on that procedure and whether they disclose this as a relevant “conflict of interest.” METHOD: We conducted a two-step literature review of five medical procedures—abortion, rhinoplasty, Mohs micrographic surgery, transurethral resection of the prostate, and laminectomy. We identified articles published between June 2011 and May 2012, and we calculated the proportion of articles authored by clinicians who also perform that procedure as well as the percentage that reported clinical care as a conflict of interest. We then screened conflict of interest statements on publications on said procedures from the same journals between 2012 and 2019 and calculated the proportion of publications that reported clinical work as a conflict of interest. RESULTS: We identified 135 publications that met inclusion criteria. We calculated that 100% of publications on rhinoplasty, transurethral resection of the prostate, and Mohs included a clinician who performs that procedure. Seventy-five percent of publications on laminectomy and 78% of publications on abortion included a clinician. None of the reviewed research articles included a disclosure that the authors also performed the procedure. From 2012 to 2019, there were 1,903 published articles on these procedures. None included a conflict of interest that disclosed clinical work as a conflict of interest. CONCLUSION: Although abortion providers publish as clinician-researchers at rates similar to surgeons in other areas of medicine, they alone face accusations that their clinical expertise is a potential conflict of interest. This stigmatizing practice could have wide-ranging consequences including delegitimization of the scientific method and peer review process broadly.","Neill, Sara; Martin, Lisa; Harris, Lisa",Womens Health (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33140705/; https://doi.org/10.1177/1745506520969616,8

641637,Pediatric genetics: rare is common,2020-06-11,"Abstract Overview Feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is a retrovirus closely related to human immunodeficiency virus. Most felids are susceptible to FIV, but humans are not. Feline immunodeficiency virus is endemic in domestic cat populations worldwide. The virus loses infectivity quickly outside the host and is susceptible to all disinfectants. Infection Feline immunodeficiency virus is transmitted via bites. The risk of transmission is low in households with socially well-adapted cats. Transmission from mother to kittens may occur, especially if the queen is undergoing an acute infection. Cats with FIV are persistently infected in spite of their ability to mount antibody and cell-mediated immune responses. Disease signs Infected cats generally remain free of clinical signs for several years, and some cats never develop disease, depending on the infecting isolate. Most clinical signs are the consequence of immunodeficiency and secondary infection. Typical manifestations are chronic gingivostomatitis, chronic rhinitis, lymphadenopathy, weight loss and immune-mediated glomerulonephritis. Diagnosis Positive in-practice ELISA results obtained in a low-prevalence or low-risk population should always be confirmed by a laboratory. Western blot is the ‘gold standard’ laboratory test for FIV serology. PCR-based assays vary in performance. Disease management Cats should never be euthanased solely on the basis of an FIV-positive test result. Cats infected with FIV may live as long as uninfected cats, with appropriate management. Asymptomatic FIV-infected cats should be neutered to avoid fighting and virus transmission. Infected cats should receive regular veterinary health checks. They can be housed in the same ward as other patients, but should be kept in individual cages. Vaccination recommendations At present, there is no FIV vaccine commercially available in Europe. Potential benefits and risks of vaccinating FIV-infected cats should be assessed on an individual cat basis. Needles and surgical instruments used on FIV-positive cats may transmit the virus to other cats, so strict hygiene is essential.","Hosie, Margaret J.; Addie, Diane; Belák, Sándor; Boucraut-Baralon, Corine; Egberink, Herman; Frymus, Tadeusz; Gruffydd-Jones, Tim; Hartmann, Katrin; Lloret, Albert; Lutz, Hans; Marsilio, Fulvio; Pennisi, Maria Grazia; Radford, Alan D.; Thiry, Etienne; Truyen, Uwe; Horzinek, Marian C.",Journal of Feline Medicine & Surgery,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1098612X09001181; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jfms.2009.05.006; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098612X09001181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19481037/,8
642297,Gene–Environment Interaction in the Era of Precision Medicine – Filling the Potholes Rather Than Starting to Build a New Road,2020-10-06,"INTRODUCTION: We all know about the grave situation caused by the novel coronavirus in recent times. Although the maxillofacial surgeons are not at forefront of dealing with the coronavirus directly, they are at increased risk due to their working area on face, mouth, and oral cavity. There is an urgent need to upgrade the already set guidelines and follow them stringently. Any procedure done within the oral cavity is a high-risk procedure and this upgradation is necessary because present means are insufficient to prevent infection from this deadly virus. This article aims to review and discuss all the new gadgets and armamentarium required to deal with patients during and post coronavirus pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors performed a thorough literature search on various armamentarium and new gadgets introduced into the field of dentistry during the coronavirus pandemic worldwide. The relevant armamentarium is discussed under three broad headings, namely, those required before, during and after the procedures for easy understanding. RESULTS: A total of 15 gadgets and armamentarium related to oral and maxillofacial surgical practice are named and discussed in the literature review. DISCUSSION: We are particularly vulnerable to the transmission of diseases easily both due to the field of interest of work and type of instrumentation. Thus, we need to be extremely cautious about the procedure. Since, the literature is scarce about the sequelae of the coronavirus disease; shift to the automated, contactless gadgets is the way to look forward to a healthy dental practice. CONCLUSION: These gadgets are user friendly for any small dental set-up as well. The choice of these upgraded instruments are prerogative of the individual professionals according to their exclusive practice. Yet, the authors encourage all health care professionals to focus on better training in infection control and cross-contamination.","Datarkar, Abhay; Tayal, Shikha; Anukula, Hema",Ann Maxillofac Surg,https://doi.org/10.4103/ams.ams_164_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33708594/,8

643517,Bending the epidemic curve: advancements and opportunities to reduce the threat of emerging pathogens,2019-04-03,"Much of the Eastern Cape province in South Africa has been experiencing a severe drought since 2015. This drought has had major socio-economic effects particularly on the large impoverished rural population as well as on some urban areas where supplied water services have broken down in several cases. The region is influenced by both midlatitude and tropical systems leading to a complex regional meteorology that hitherto has not been much studied compared to other parts of South Africa. Here, the ongoing drought is examined in the context of long-term trends and the interannual rainfall variability of the region. Although the region has experienced drought in all seasons since 2015, focus here is placed on the spring (September–November) which shows the most consistent and robust signal. On average, this season contributes between about 25–35% of the annual rainfall total. Based on CHIRPS data, it is found that this season shows a significant decreasing trend in both rainfall totals as well as the number of rainfall days (but not heavy rainfall days) for spring over most of the province since 1981. On interannual time scales, the results indicate that dry (wet) springs over the Eastern Cape are associated with a cyclonic (anticyclonic) anomaly southeast of South Africa as part of a shift in the zonal wavenumber 3 pattern in the midlatitudes. Over the landmass, a stronger (weaker) Botswana High is also apparent with increased (decreased) subsidence over and near the Eastern Cape which is less (more) favourable for cloud band development and hence reduced (enhanced) rainfall during dry (wet) springs. Analysis of mid-century (2040–2060) CMIP5 rainfall projections suggests that there may be a flattening of the annual cycle over the Eastern Cape with the winter becoming wetter and the summer drier. For the spring season of interest here, the multi-model projections also indicate drying but less pronounced than that projected for the summer.","Mahlalela, P. T.; Blamey, R. C.; Hart, N. C.

644007,Common Respiratory Diseases,2010-05-19,"This study aimed to investigate burnout among physicians during the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. This research was conducted in a pandemic hospital which is among the largest hospital complexes in Turkey. Internal medicine physicians actively working in many departments under the severe conditions in the diagnosis and treatment processes were included. Among the physicians constituting the study population, residents, attendings, and subspecialists from different fields were included. These physicians were working in the quarantine services, inpatient services, intensive care units, and polyclinics. A short and easy face-to-face survey, in which included questions on demographic information, medicolegal subjects, and questions from the Maslach Burnout Inventory, was used to collect data. While 58.2% of the physicians stated that they were extremely worried about malpractice in the pandemic period, 82.1% stated they needed training on medicolegal subjects, and 25.4% stated they were exposed to violence during work. Three sub-dimensions within the burnout inventory were compared with other parameters. The Cronbach alpha value was found highly reliable in the evaluation of the answers' internal consistency. The notable significance of burnout was interesting regarding physicians' anxiety on medicolegal issues and exposure to violence (p < 0.05). The findings obtained in this study suggest that healthcare workers' motivations will increase if they feel valued, their working conditions have been improved, and if they are in mentally well. This mental wellness may contribute to fighting public health crises such as a pandemic more efficiently with the lowest number of casualties.","Buran, Ferat; Altın, Zeynep",Leg Med (Tokyo),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.legalmed.2021.101881; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33857752/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1344622321000456?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1344622321000456,8
644158,The Application of Bicarbonate Recovers the Chemical-Physical Properties of Airway Surface Liquid in Cystic Fibrosis Epithelia Models,2021-03-29,"Background. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza are significant causes of seasonal respiratory illness in children. The incidence of influenza and RSV hospitalization is well documented, but the incidence of medically attended, laboratory-confirmed illness has not been assessed in a well defined community cohort. Methods. Children aged 6–59 months with medically attended acute respiratory illness were prospectively enrolled during the 2006–2007 through 2009–2010 influenza seasons in a Wisconsin community cohort. Nasal swabs were tested for RSV and influenza by multiplex reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. The population incidence of medically attended RSV and influenza was estimated separately and standardized to weeks 40 through 18 of each season. Results. The cohort included 2800–3073 children each season. There were 2384 children enrolled with acute respiratory illness; 627 (26%) were positive for RSV and 314 (13%) for influenza. The mean age was 28 months (standard deviation [SD] = 15) for RSV-positive and 38 months (SD = 16) for influenza-positive children. Seasonal incidence (cases per 10 000) was 1718 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1602–1843) for RSV and 768 (95% CI, 696–848) for influenza. Respiratory syncytial virus incidence was highest among children 6–11 (2927) and 12–23 months old (2377). Influenza incidence was highest (850) in children 24–59 months old. The incidence of RSV was higher than influenza across all seasons and age groups. Conclusions. The incidence of medically attended RSV was highest in children 6–23 months old, and it was consistently higher than influenza. The burden of RSV remains high throughout the first 2 years of life.","Simpson, Melissa D.; Kieke, Burney A.; Sundaram, Maria E.; McClure, David L.; Meece, Jennifer K.; Sifakis, Frangiscos; Gasser, Robert A.; Belongia, Edward A.",Open Forum Infect Dis,https://doi.org/10.1093/ofid/ofw081; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27419158/,8
645040,Diagnostic Performance and Usability of the Genedrive(®) HCV ID Kit in Two Decentralized Settings in Cameroon and Georgia,2021-04-22,"BACKGROUND: Many off-site COVID-19 testing centers (OSCTCs) are struggling with strategies to serve vulnerable populations who have some of the highest rates of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. Inter-OSCTC sharing of successful protocols and systems has been hampered by evolving resource constraints, the changing science of testing, and ever increasing COVID-19 case counts. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to identify promising approaches to testing vulnerable populations. METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 26 leaders of OSCTCs and public health departments across the United States between June 8th and August 10th, 2020. All interviews were coded utilizing oral coding via rapid identification of themes from audio recordings, and analysis occurred concurrently with data collection to assess when saturation was achieved. RESULTS: Six main themes emerged highlighting approaches to testing within vulnerable populations including: 1. Expanding services to support health and health-related needs beyond COVID-19; 2. Gaining community trust; 3. Developing and leveraging community partnerships; 4. Promoting clear and creative messaging; 5. Prioritizing patient experience; and 6. Managing patient results. CONCLUSIONS: Testing among the vulnerable not only helps those at highest risk of severe disease or death from COVID-19, but also presents a critical opportunity to control viral spread within and from these communities. Reaching vulnerable populations is challenging and requires multi-sector collaboration, additional funding, and high levels of creativity and flexibility.","Winterbauer, Elizabeth; Levy, Phillip D.; Calhoun, Dustin; Elwell, Timothy; Fishbein, Eliza; Donohue, Stacy; Little, Jessica",Healthc (Amst),https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hjdsi.2021.100519; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33454583/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213076421000014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2213076421000014,8

The aim of this study was to objectively investigate olfactory dysfunction in two cohorts of patients at two different stages: during acute illness and after a median recovery of 4 months. METHODS: Twenty-five acutely ill patients and 26 recovered subjects were investigated. Acute patients had a molecular diagnosis of COVID-19; recovered subjects had a positive antibody assay and a negative molecular test. A 33-item psychophysical olfactory identification test tailored for the Italian population was performed. RESULTS: Median time from symptoms onset to olfactory test was 33 days in acute patients and 122 days in recovered subjects. The former scored a significantly higher number of errors at psychophysical testing (median [IQR]: 8 [13] vs 3 [2], p < 0.001) and were more frequently hyposmic (64% vs 19%, p = 0.002). Recovered subjects reported a variable time to subjective olfactory recovery, from days up to 4 months. Participants included in the study reported no significant nasal symptoms at olfactory testing. Among recovered subject who reported olfactory loss during acute COVID-19, four (27%) were still hyposmic. Demographic and clinical characteristics did not show significant associations with olfactory dysfunction. CONCLUSION: Moderate-to-severe hospitalized patients showed a high level and frequency of olfactory dysfunction compared to recovered subjects. In the latter group, subjects who reported persisting olfactory dysfunction showed abnormal scores on psychophysical testing, indicating that, at least in some subjects, persistent hyposmia may represent a long-term sequela of COVID-19.

646502,The chronology of the 2002–2003 SARS mini pandemic,2004-11-05,"The Dicistroviridae are a family of small icosahedral viruses with single-stranded RNA, positive-sense genomes that infect invertebrates. The genomes are organized with their nonstructural proteins encoded at the 5′ end with the structural proteins at the 3′ end. Characteristically, the two open reading frames are separated by an untranslated region that is capable of acting as an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). In addition to the structural proteins being expressed from this IRES, translation usually initiates from a noncanonical amino acid, generally alanine. The dicistroviruses share a number of characteristics, for example, virion structure, genomic organization, and the absence of subgenomic RNAs with other picorna-like viruses of plants, animals, and protists that suggest a shared evolutionary origin and a higher-order taxonomic grouping for such viruses. Most dicistroviruses, with the exception of cricket paralysis virus (CrPV), have restricted host ranges and only infect species from a single insect order. In contrast, CrPV is able to infect over 20 species of insects and several insect cell lines. Most dicistroviruses have vertical and horizontal components in their transmission and generally produce few noticeable disease symptoms. Infection with dicistroviruses does, however, usually result in a shortened life span and reduced fecundity of the host.","Christian, P.D.; Scotti, P.D.",Encyclopedia of Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123744104006087; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/B9780123744104006087,8
646524,Pathological and Therapeutic Approach to Endotoxin-Secreting Bacteria Involved in Periodontal Disease,2021-07-29,"By mid-May 2020, cases of COVID-19 in the UK had been declining for over a month; a multi-phase emergence from lockdown was planned, including a scheduled partial reopening of schools on 1 June 2020. Although evidence suggests that children generally display mild symptoms, the size of the school-age population means the total impact of reopening schools is unclear. Here, we present work from mid-May 2020 that focused on the imminent opening of schools and consider what these results imply for future policy. We compared eight strategies for reopening primary and secondary schools in England. Modifying a transmission model fitted to UK SARS-CoV-2 data, we assessed how reopening schools affects contact patterns, anticipated secondary infections and the relative change in the reproduction number, R. We determined the associated public health impact and its sensitivity to changes in social distancing within the wider community. We predicted that reopening schools with half-sized classes or focused on younger children was unlikely to push R above one. Older children generally have more social contacts, so reopening secondary schools results in more cases than reopening primary schools, while reopening both could have pushed R above one in some regions. Reductions in community social distancing were found to outweigh and exacerbate any impacts of reopening. In particular, opening schools when the reproduction number R is already above one generates the largest increase in cases. Our work indicates that while any school reopening will result in increased mixing and infection amongst children and the wider population, reopening schools alone in June 2020 was unlikely to push R above one. Ultimately, reopening decisions are a difficult trade-off between epidemiological consequences and the emotional, educational and developmental needs of children. Into the future, there are difficult questions about what controls can be instigated such that schools can remain open if cases increase.

Ecuador's response to the novel virus Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) started on February 26, 2020, one month after the outbreak began in China. As of today, the countries with more confirmed cases in South America are Brazil and Ecuador. Although Brazil has two times the number of cases than Ecuador (Brazil: 700 cases per 100000 people vs. Ecuador: 400 cases per 100000), the huge population difference between the two countries raises concerns about the public health policies implemented by the Ecuadorian government. Even though there is no cure for COVID-19, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are promising alternatives. The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak has shown that there is room for improvement in the healthcare systems worldwide and the disastrous results on the fragile often unprepared are those systems in developing countries.","Hallo, Alejandro; Rojas, Alejandra; Hallo, Carlos",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32351831/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.7452,8

We reported a case of a 61-year-old patient with flu-like symptoms and a suspected COVID-19 pneumonia. After a negative PCR-test, a non-contrast enhanced CT was performed which revealed a suspicious hyperdensity in the left pulmonary artery and a pneumonia in the left lower lobe. A contrast enhanced CT confirmed a pulmonary embolism. An acute pulmonary embolism is a major complication and a main differential diagnosis of COVID-19. A hyperdense pulmonary artery sign (PAS) is a sensitive sign for a pulmonary embolism.

METHOD: documentary study based on Brazilian and Portuguese governmental guidelines issued between March and August 2020 regarding access of children to primary health care. Thematic analysis was based on the precepts of health vulnerability. RESULTS: 13 documents were issued in both countries addressing access to vaccination and childcare. Due to the SARS-CoV-2, restrictions were imposed on the circulation of people in social environments, health services, and social protection, decreasing the demand for health services. Both countries continued programs to promote the health of breastfeeding infants. In-person childcare consultations were suspended for low-risk children in both countries. Portugal maintained routine vaccination while Brazil interrupted vaccination in the first 15 days of the pandemic. The countries adopted remote care strategies - telemonitoring, teleconsultation, and mobile applications - to maintain the bond between children and health services. CONCLUSION: longitudinality was affected due to restricted access of children to health promotion actions, determining greater programmatic vulnerability. Individual vulnerabilities are related to exposure to preventable and primary health care-sensitive diseases.","Cabral, Ivone Evangelista; Pestana-Santos, Márcia; Ciuffo, Lia Leão; Nunes, Yan do Rosario; Lomba, Maria de Lurdes Lopes de Freitas",Revista latino-americana de enfermagem,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34231787/; https://doi.org/10.1590/1518-8345.4805.3422,8
649157,The Lab Must Go On: Clinical Laboratory Management in a World Turned Upside Down,2020-10-29,"BACKGROUND: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, urology was one of the specialties with the lowest rates of telemedicine and videoconferencing use. Common barriers to the implementation of telemedicine included a lack of technological literacy, concerns with reimbursement, and resistance to changes in the workplace. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic declared in March 2020, the delivery of urological services globally has quickly shifted to telemedicine to account for the mass clinical, procedural, and operative cancellations, inadequate personal protective equipment, and shortage of personnel. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate current telemedicine usage by urologists, urologists’ perceptions on the necessity of in-person clinic appointments, the usability of telemedicine, and the current barriers to its implementation. METHODS: We conducted a global, cross-sectional, web-based survey to investigate the use of telemedicine before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Urologists’ perceived usability of telemedicine was assessed using a modified Delphi approach to create questions based on a modified version of the validated Telehealth Usability Questionnaire (TUQ). For the purposes of this study, telemedicine was defined as video calls only. RESULTS: A total of 620 urologists from 58 different countries and 6 continents participated in the survey. Prior to COVID-19, 15.8% (n=98) of urologists surveyed were using telemedicine in their clinical practices; during the pandemic, that proportion increased to 46.1% (n=283). Of the urologists without telemedicine experience, interest in telemedicine usage increased from 43.7% (n=139) to 80.8% (n=257) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Among urologists that used telemedicine during the pandemic, 80.9% (n=244) were interested in continuing to use it in their practice. The three most commonly used platforms were Zoom, Doxy.me, and Epic, and the top three barriers to implementing telemedicine were patients’ lack of technological comprehension, patients’ lack of access to the required technology, and reimbursement concerns. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to quantify the use, usability, and pervading interest in telemedicine among urologists during the COVID-19 pandemic. In the face of this pandemic, urologists’ usage of telemedicine nearly tripled, demonstrating their ability to adopt and adapt telemedicine into their practices, but barriers involving the technology itself are still preventing many from utilizing it despite increasing interest.","Dubin, Justin M; Wyant, W Austin; Balaji, Navin C; Ong, William LK; Kettache, Reda H; Haffaf, Malik; Zouari, Skander; Santillan, Diego; Autrán Gómez, Ana Maria; Sadeghi-Nejad, Hossein; Loeb, Stacy; Borin, James F; Gomez Rivas, Juan; Grummet, Jeremy; Ramasamy, Ranjith; Teoh, Jeremy Y C",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/21875; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33031047/,8

No recommendations regarding the duration of anticoagulation have been made, because data on the long-term course beyond the first weeks is lacking. OBJECTIVE To report on the treatment, medical course, and longitudinal follow-up of laboratory parameters in patients with vaccine-induced prothrombotic immune thrombocytopenia (VIPIT). PATIENTS We followed VIPIT patients with- (n = 3) and without (n = 3) venous thromboembolism fulfilling the aforementioned laboratory criteria. RESULTS Elevated D-dimer (median: 35.10 μg/ml, range: 17.80-52.70), thrombocytopenia (42 G/l, 20-101), and strong positivity in the platelet factor 4 (PF4)/heparin-enzyme-immunoassay (2.42 optical density [OD], 2.06-3.13; reference range < 0.50) were present in all patients after vaccination (10 days, 7-17). Routine laboratory parameters rapidly improved upon initiation of treatment (comprising therapeutic non-heparin anticoagulation in all patients and high dose immunoglobulins ± corticosteroids in 5 patients). PF4 antibody levels slowly decreased over several weeks. Patients were discharged in good physical health (8 days, 5-13). VIPIT did not recur during follow-up (12 weeks, 8-17). Five of 6 patients fully recovered (in 2 patients thrombosis had resolved, in 1 patient exertional dyspnea persisted). CONCLUSIONS Remissions without sequelae can be achieved upon rapid initiation of treatment in patients with VIPIT. Platelet factor 4 antibody levels slowly decreased over several weeks but VIPIT did not recur in any of our patients. Continuation of anticoagulation in VIPIT patients at least until PF4 antibody negativity is reached seems reasonable.","Thaler, Johannes; Jilma, Petra; Samadi, Nazanin; Roitner, Florian; Mikušková, Eva; Kudrnovsky-Moser, Stephan; Rettl, Joachim; Preiss, Raphael; Quehenberger, Peter; Pabinger, Ingrid; Knoebl, Paul; Ay, Cihan",Thrombosis research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34624672/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.thromres.2021.09.017,8

The virus infects epithelial cells by using the spike protein on its surface to bind to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor on the cells. Thus, candidate vaccines targeting the spike protein are currently being developed to prevent against infections. Approximately 44 SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines are in clinical trials (phase I–III) and an additional 164 candidates are in preclinical stages. The efficacy data from phase I/II trials of lead candidate vaccines look very promising with virus-neutralizing geometric mean antibody titers in the range of 16.6–3906. Most recently, two SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, have been granted the first emergency use authorization (EUA) in the U.S.; BNT162b2 has also been granted an EUA in the United Kingdom, Canada, and in the European Union. This review assesses whether SARS-CoV-2 candidate vaccines (with approved EUA or in phase III trials) meet the criteria for an ideal SARS-CoV-2 vaccine.

Despite their beauty, Costa Rican beaches can pose a high risk for foreign visitors: Drowning is the primary cause of unintentional death among international visitors. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of demographics, spatial and temporal trends of national and foreigner fatal drowning occurring at Costa Rican beaches during 2001–2019. For national beachgoers, teens and young male adults, ages 15–30 years are at greatest risk of drowning, while for foreigners, older adults ages 45–60 years exhibit higher risk. Temporal trends in drowning appear to be correlated with the number of beach visitors, which seem to be driven mainly by a combination of socioeconomical and climatic/weather factors. For instance, strong economic indicators for the Costa Rican population combined with good weather fostered during warm phases of El Niño Southern Oscillation attract more national beachgoers, which may increase the number of drowning deaths. These results will help authorities better understand the complex and dynamic drowning situation to develop better prevention strategies and policies that improve beach safety and raise awareness about coastal hazards and risk. Such actions will bolster the reputation of Costa Rica as a safe touristic destination.","Segura, L.

Performance was assessed by the penalty points attained, anxiety by the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2, strain by the Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) method. Moreover, Heart Rate was continuously monitored for fifty-four female national level Eventing horse-riders. Lockdown decreased performance outcome of horse-riders in Eventing competitions up to six weeks, with the Dressage test being the most affected discipline. Performance in Dressage was strongly related to both anxiety and session-RPE. After lockdown, Show-Jumping and Cross-Country courses were shorter allowing RPE to remain stable, session-RPE to significantly decline and cardiovascular strain not to exceed pre-lockdown values. In conclusion, emotional stress in Dressage and workload in Cross-Country should be carefully managed by equestrian Eventing stakeholders when planning training and competitions after a period of lockdown. Moreover, sRPE appears to offer a practical method of monitoring riders load during training and competition and could also be of use for home-based training during any future sport activities restrictions.","Demarie, Sabrina; Galvani, Christel; Billat, Veronique Louise",Int J Environ Res Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph17228648; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33233325/,8
651352,A feasibility study of controlled human infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae in Malawi,2021-09-24,"Background: The purpose of this study is to determine the incidence and significance of hypouricemia in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Pulmonary lesions in patients with SARS are thought to result from proinflammatory cytokine dysregulation. Acute renal failure has been reported in patients with SARS, but whether cytokines can injure renal tubules is unknown. Methods: Sixty patients diagnosed with SARS in Taiwan in April 2003 were studied. Patients were identified as hypouricemic when their serum uric acid (UA) level was less than 2.5 mg/dL (<149 μmol/L) within 15 days after fever onset. Urine UA and creatinine levels were available for 43 patients; the serum cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were measured in 16 patients. Results: Sixteen patients (26.7%) had hypouricemia (UA, 1.68 ± 0.52 mg/dL [100 ± 31 μmol/L]). No differences in age, sex, symptoms, vital signs, hemogram, or other biochemistry data existed between the hypouricemic and normouricemic groups. Fractional excretion (FE) of UA (FE(UA)) in 12 hypouricemic patients was 39.6% ± 23.4%, significantly greater than that of 31 normouricemic patients (16.4% ± 11.4%; P < 0.0001). After adjustments for age and sex, high FE(UA) was significantly associated with the lowest blood oxygenation (P = 0.001; r = −0.624). The number of catastrophic outcomes (endotracheal intubation and/or death) adjusted for older age and sex showed that hypouremic patients had an odds ratio of 10.57 (confidence interval, 2.33 to 47.98; P = 0.002). Kaplan-Meier curves for catastrophic outcome–free results showed significant differences between patients with normouricemia or hypouricemia (P = 0.01). Serum IL-8 levels correlated significantly with FE(UA) (P < 0.001; r = 0.785) and inversely with serum UA level (P = 0.044; r = −0.509); neither IL-6 nor TNF-α level showed such correlations. Conclusion: One fourth of patients with SARS developed hypouricemia, which might result from a defect in renal UA handling and was associated with a high serum IL-8 level. Renal hypouricemia is an ominous sign in patients with SARS.","Wu, Vin-Cent; Huang, Jenq-Wen; Hsueh, Po-Ren; Yang, Ya-Fei; Tsai, Hung-Bin; Kan, Wei-Chih; Chang, Hong-Wei; Wu, Kwan-Dun",Am J Kidney Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15696447/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0272638604014180; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272638604014180,8

In this retrospective observational study we are evaluating the demographic characteristics, the comorbidities of the patients, the clinical signs of the infection, the signs of clinical severity, the biological assessment at admission, the treatment, the outcomes and the deaths of 133 patients with COVID-19, of which 25 (19,4%) had diabetes. In the compared COVID-19 patients, with and without diabetes, the patients with diabetes were older, had higher blood pressure and more cardio-vascular diseases. Severe forms were more present in diabetic patients (56% versus 27.1%). Weight loss was higher in diabetic patients (6kg versus 3kg). Biologically, diabetic patients had higher levels of C-reactive protein (28 versus 5.8mg/l), procalcitonin (0.28 versus 0,13ng/l), ferritin (501 versus 140ng/ml), lactic dehydrogenase (268 versus 226IU/l) and of D. dimer (665 versus 444μg/l). Diabetic patients required more oxygen therapy (60% versus 26.9%), more mechanical ventilation (20% versus 8.3%) and more frequent admission to the intensive care unit (60% versus 27.8%). They presented more thromboembolic complications (12% versus 9%) but there were not significant differences in the other outcomes and in death rates. The excess of morbidity and mortality due to diabetes was still not fully clarified; the role of demographic factors, the interaction of mediations with ACE-2 receptors and the role of co-morbidities will all need to be studied in order to identify the patient at risk profile, i.e. who can develop severe forms of the diseases and more outcomes. The early identification of a possible hyper inflammation could be very valuable.

As such, many hotel personnel are uninformed of WMPs and the precautions to take if their hotel water system is compromised. The purpose of this study was to identify hotel personnel’s knowledge and practices of WMPs through a survey incorporating the Health Belief Model (HBM). Data were collected from 59 hotels within Fulton County, Georgia, USA, through a questionnaire, and questions were developed tailored to the HBM. Significant associations were found between the perceived susceptibility of contracting a waterborne illness and WMP for hotel personnel as well as between cues to action and having a WMP in general linear models (p ≤ 0.05). The study concludes that many key personnel are not aware of WMPs. Many hotel facilities do not have a plan in place, and some facilities are unaware of a current plan is in place. The study findings provide insight into the importance of WMPs and the risk factors associated with microbial contamination in a hotel building’s plumbing system.

Here, we developed and evaluated a novel microsphere-based antibody assay (MBA) for the detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (NP) and spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). Method: We developed a microsphere-based assay (MBA) to determine the levels of IgG against SARS-CoV-2 NP and spike RBD. The seropositive cut-off mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) was set using a cohort of 294 anonymous serum specimens collected in 2018. The specificity was assessed using serum specimens collected from organ donors or influenza patients before 2020. Seropositive rate was determined among patients with COVID-19. Time-to-seropositivity and signal-to-cutoff (S/CO) ratio were compared between MBA and EIA. Results: MBA had a specificity of 100% (93/93; 95% confidence interval [CI], 96-100%) for anti-NP IgG and 98.9% (92/93; 95% CI 94.2-100%) for anti-RBD IgG. The MBA seropositive rate for convalescent serum specimens of COVID-19 patients were 89.8% (35/39) for anti-NP IgG and 79.5% (31/39) for anti-RBD IgG. The time-to-seropositivity was shorter with MBA than that of EIA. When compared with EIA, MBA could better differentiate between COVID-19 patients and negative controls with significantly higher S/CO ratio for COVID-19 patients and lower S/CO ratio with negative controls. MBA also had fewer specimens in the equivocal range (S/CO 0.9-1.1) than EIA.

Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several genetic loci associated with the severe COVID-19 symptoms. Delineating the genetic variants and genes is important for better understanding its biological mechanisms. We implemented integrative approaches, including transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), colocalization analysis, and functional element prediction analysis, to interpret the genetic risks using two independent GWAS datasets in lung and immune cells. To understand the context-specific molecular alteration, we further performed deep learning-based single-cell transcriptomic analyses on a bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) dataset from moderate and severe COVID-19 patients. We discovered and replicated the genetically regulated expression of CXCR6 and CCR9 genes. These two genes have a protective effect on lung, and a risk effect on whole blood, respectively. The colocalization analysis of GWAS and cis-expression quantitative trait loci highlighted the regulatory effect on CXCR6 expression in lung and immune cells. In the lung-resident memory CD8(+) T (T(RM)) cells, we found a 2.24-fold decrease of cell proportion among CD8(+) T cells and lower expression of CXCR6 in the severe patients than moderate patients. Pro-inflammatory transcriptional programs were highlighted in the T(RM) cellular trajectory from moderate to severe patients. CXCR6 from the 3p21.31 locus is associated with severe COVID-19. CXCR6 tends to have a lower expression in lung T(RM) cells of severe patients, which aligns with the protective effect of CXCR6 from TWAS analysis.

657464,Flavonoids as natural phenolic compounds and their role in therapeutics: an overview,2021-01-20,"Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the causative agent of infectious bronchitis, which results in considerable economic losses. It is imperative to develop safe and efficient candidate vaccines to control IBV infection. In the current study, recombinant baculoviruses co-expressing the S1 and N proteins and mono-expressing S1 or N proteins of the GX-YL5 strain of IBV were constructed and prepared into subunit vaccines rHBM-S1-N, rHBM-S1 and rHBM-N. The levels of immune protection of these subunit vaccines were evaluated by inoculating specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens at 14 days of age, giving them a booster with the same dose 14 days later and challenging them with a virulent GX-YL5 strain of IBV 14 days post-booster (dpb). The commercial vaccine strain H120 was used as a control. The IBV-specific antibody levels, as well as the percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, were detected within 28 days post-vaccination (dpv). The morbidity, mortality and re-isolation of the virus from the tracheas and kidneys of challenged birds were evaluated at five days post-challenge (dpc). The results showed that the IBV-specific antibody levels and the percentages of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes were higher in the rHBM-S1-N vaccinated birds compared to birds vaccinated with the rHBM-S1 and rHBM-N vaccines. At 5 dpc, the mortality, morbidity and virus re-isolation rate of the birds vaccinated with the rHBM-S1-N vaccine were slightly higher than those vaccinated with the H120 control vaccine but were lower than those vaccinated with the rHBM-S1 and rHBM-N vaccines. The present study demonstrated that the protection of the recombinant baculovirus co-expressing S1 and N proteins was better than that of recombinant baculoviruses mono-expressing the S1 or N protein. Thus, the recombinant baculovirus co-expressing S1 and N proteins could serve as a potential IBV vaccine and this demonstrates that the bivalent subunit vaccine including the S1 and N proteins might be a strategy for the development of an IBV subunit vaccine.","Yuan, Yuan; Zhang, Zhi-Peng; He, Yi-Ning; Fan, Wen-Sheng; Dong, Zhi-Hua; Zhang, Li-Hua; Sun, Xin-Kuan; Song, Li-Li; Wei, Tian-Chao; Mo, Mei-Lan; Wei, Ping",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29954092/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v10070347,8
658194,Approach to the diagnosis and classification of blood diseases,2009-05-22,"INTRODUCTION: Commercially available serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 detect antibodies to either the nucleocapsid or spike protein. Here we compare the performance of the Beckman-Coulter SARS-CoV-2 spike IgG assay to that of the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid IgG and Roche Anti-SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid total antibody assays. In addition, we document the trend in nucleocapsid and spike antibodies in sequential samples collected from convalescent plasma donors. METHODS: Plasma or serum samples from 20 individual SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive inpatients (n=172), 20 individual convalescent donors with a previous RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=20), were deemed positive SARS-CoV-2 samples. RT-PCR-negative inpatients (n=24), and 109 pre-SARS-CoV-2 samples were determined to be SARS-CoV-2 negative. Samples were assayed by the Abbott, Roche, and Beckman assays. RESULTS: All three assays demonstrated 100% specificity. Abbott, Beckman, and Roche platforms had sensitivities of 98%, 93%, and 90% respectively, with the difference in sensitivity attributed primarily to samples from immunocompromised patients. After the exclusion of samples immunocompromised patients, all assays exhibited ≥95% sensitivity. In sequential samples collected from the same individuals, the Roche nucleocapsid antibody assay demonstrated continually increasing signal intensity, with maximal values observed at the last time point examined. In contrast, the Beckman spike IgG antibody signal peaked between 14-28 days post positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR and steadily declined in subsequent samples. Subsequent collections 51-200 days (median of 139 days) post positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR from five inpatients and five convalescent donors revealed that spike and nucleocapsid antibodies remained detectable for several months after confirmed infection. CONCLUSIONS: The three assays are sensitive and specific for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Nucleocapsid and spike antibodies were detectable for up to 200 days post-positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR but demonstrated markedly different trends in signal intensity.","Poore, Brad; Nerenz, Robert D.; Brodis, Dina; Brown, Charles I.; Cervinski, Mark A.; Hubbard, Jacqueline A.",Clin Biochem,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009912021001521?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34118242/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clinbiochem.2021.05.011; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0009912021001521,8
658301,"Dengue and human health: A global scenario of its occurrence, diagnosis and therapeutics",2021-05-20,"Broccoli sprouts are a convenient and rich source of the glucosinolate glucoraphanin, which can generate the chemopreventive agent sulforaphane through the catalytic actions of plant myrosinase or β-thioglucosidases in the gut microflora. Sulforaphane, in turn, is an inducer of cytoprotective enzymes through activation of Nrf2 signaling, and a potent inhibitor of carcinogenesis in multiple murine models. Sulforaphane is also protective in models of diabetes, neurodegenerative disease, and other inflammatory processes, likely reflecting additional actions of Nrf2 and interactions with other signaling pathways. Translating this efficacy into the design and implementation of clinical chemoprevention trials, especially food-based trials, faces numerous challenges including the selection of the source, placebo, and dose as well as standardization of the formulation of the intervention material. Unlike in animals, purified sulforaphane has had very limited use in clinical studies. We have conducted a series of clinical studies and randomized clinical trials to evaluate the effects of composition (glucoraphanin-rich [± myrosinase] vs. sulforaphane-rich or mixture beverages), formulation (beverage vs. tablet) and dose, on the efficacy of these broccoli sprout-based preparations to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic action, and clinical benefit. While the challenges for the evaluation of broccoli sprouts in clinical trials are themselves formidable, further hurdles must be overcome to bring this science to public health action.","Fahey, Jed W.; Kensler, Thomas W.",Front Nutr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33996874/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fnut.2021.648788,8
658428,Contagious Disease and Self-Defence,2007-03-13,"Introduction: National medicines regulatory agencies are faced with challenges including limited resources and technical capacity, resulting in countries collaborating and sharing resources to improve efficiency of the review process to facilitate access to quality-assured medicines by their populations. One such collaboration is the Southern African Development Community (SADC) medicines registration collaborative initiative, ZaZiBoNa. Countries participate in the initiative by contributing to regulatory reviews and good manufacturing practices inspections. The aim of this study was to review and compare the registration processes of regulatory authorities of Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe to identify strategies for better alignment. Methods: A senior member of the division responsible for issuing marketing authorisations completed an established and validated questionnaire, which standardises the review process, allowing key milestones, activities and practices of the six regulatory authorities to be identified and compared. The completed questionnaires were validated by the heads of the respective agencies. Results: The six countries vary in population and in the size of their respective regulatory agency and the resources allocated to regulatory reviews. The review processes of the six agencies were similar; however, differences were noted in the milestones recorded; for example, two of the countries did not record the start of the scientific assessment. Additionally, decisions for marketing authorisation were made by an expert committee in four of the countries and by the head of the agency and the Minister of Health in two countries. All six agencies implemented the majority of good review practices; however, the need for improvement in the areas of transparency and communication and quality decision making practices was a common finding for all six countries. Conclusions: Participation in the ZaZiBoNa initiative has improved the way in which the six agencies perform regulatory reviews in their countries, highlighting the realisation of one of the key objectives of the initiative, which was building the expert capacity of member countries. Other agencies in the SADC region and beyond can use the results of this study to identify best practices, which in turn, could improve their regulatory performance.","Sithole, Tariro; Mahlangu, Gugu; Capote, Velma; Sitoie, Tania; Shifotoka, Saren; Gaeseb, Johannes; Padayachee, Silverani; Sehloho, Tohlang; Khea, Akida; Fimbo, Adam; Munkombwe, Zuma; Mwale, Bernice; Salek, Sam; Walker, Stuart",Front Med (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fmed.2021.742181; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34513893/,8
658531,Delayed neutralizing antibody response in the acute phase correlates with severe progression of COVID-19,2021-08-16,"BACKGROUND: Human respiratory coronavirus (hCoV) HKU1 infections were reported for the first time in 2005 in Hong Kong. OBJECTIVE: To investigate epidemiological, clinical, and diagnostic features of HKU1 infections. STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal, prospective study from November 2005 through May 2006 in a hospitalised patient population. RESULTS: Overall, 48/426 (11.3%) patients were found to be infected by hCoV acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI). Of these, 10 (19.2%) were caused by HKU1 (6 single infections and 4 coinfections) during the period January–May 2006. Diagnosis was made by using RT-PCR for all four hCoVs, and in parallel, in-house developed group-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) for HKU1 and 229E. HKU1-specific MAb was able to retrospectively identify 8 of 10 HKU1 strains detected by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic analysis showed that four HKU1 strains were genotype A and six genotype B. In HKU1-infected patients, the predominant clinical symptom was rhinorrhea (nine patients). Within group II hCoV, HKU1-infected patients had a significantly lower rate of lower ARTI compared to OC43-infected patients. CONCLUSION: HKU1 hCoV strains circulated in northern Italy during the winter–spring season 2005–2006. Both HKU1 genotypes were detected. HKU1-specific MAb may contribute to the rapid diagnosis of HKU1 infections currently performed by RT-PCR.","Gerna, Giuseppe; Percivalle, Elena; Sarasini, Antonella; Campanini, Giulia; Piralla, Antonio; Rovida, Francesca; Genini, Emilia; Marchi, Antonietta; Baldanti, Fausto",J Clin Virol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1386653206004562; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1386653206004562; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17222582/,8

Also, current regimens include less effective drugs which require long duration follows up. This exploratory study was conducted to commence the investigation for crafting multi target epitope vaccine against its bacterial pathogen Tropheryma whipplei. The modern bioinformatics tools like VaxiJen, NETMHCII PAN 3.2, ALLERGEN-FP, PATCH-DOCK, TOXIC-PRED, MHCPRED and IEDB were deployed, which makes the study more intensive in analyzing proteome of T. whipplei as these methods are based on robust result generating statistical algorithms ANN, HMM, and ML.

However, information available about thrombosis risk in COVID-19 cancer patients (Ca-P) is still scarce. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 219 Ca-P who were diagnosed of COVID-19 infection in our institution during the first pandemic wave. The study population was monitored for 12 months, and TE were recorded. A descriptive analysis of baseline and follow-up clinical characteristics was performed. Potential prognostic factors for developing TE and overall survival (OS) were analysed using logistic and cox proportional regression models. Results: Overall TE rate was 13%. TE were reported during COVID-19 hospitalization (52%) and during follow-up (48%), the median time from COVID-19 diagnosis to TE was 12 weeks (w). Reported TE included pulmonary embolism (68%), deep vein thrombosis (16%), and other arterial thrombosis (16%). Pooled mortality rate among patients with TE was 52%, and 41% among patients without TE. Univariate analysis revealed haemoglobin <10g/dL, D-dimer >3000 ng/mL, PCR >5 ng/mL, LDH >190 UI/L and ferritin > 296 ng/mL during follow-up as significant prognostic factors for TE. Only ferritin > 296 ng/mL remained significant after multivariate analysis. Neither being on any specific oncological treatment nor prior anticoagulant therapy influenced TE risk. No differences in OS were found between patients who developed TE and those who did not. Though, diagnosis of TE during COVID-19 hospitalization conferred poorer survival (12 vs 52 w, p=0.02). Also, being hospitalized for COVID-19 infection was a prognostic factor for worse survival (27 vs 52 w, p=0.03). On multivariate analysis, only acute respiratory distress syndrome, metastatic disease, poor performance status, and history of TE before COVID-19 diagnosis remained significant predictors for poorer survival, and thromboprophylaxis during COVID-19 hospitalization as a predictor for better survival outcomes. Conclusions: TE in COVID-19 Ca-P can lead to fatal outcomes. Thrombotic risk may persist after acute infection;therefore, routine active surveillance should be considered. Larger studies are needed for developing a risk prediction tool for TE in COVID-19 Ca-P. Legal entity responsible for the study: The authors. Funding: Has not received any funding.

This study was intended to be a real-life study. METHODS: We treated 55 eyes with the Iridex Cyclo G6 device with the MP3 handpiece (IRIDEX Laser Systems) using a standardized protocol. Patients were followed up for a period of one year with an intention-to-treat protocol. Observation points are day 1, week 1, month 1, month 3, month 6, month 9 and year 1 after treatment. The primary outcome is a significant decrease in intra-ocular pressure (IOP) with a threshold of 20% reduction. The secondary outcomes are a reduction in the number of topical molecules needed to control glaucoma progression and the discontinuation of oral acetazolamide. RESULTS: We observed a significant IOP reduction at every observation point with a mean preoperative IOP of 24.19 mmHg (SEM: 0.96) and mean IOP at final follow-up was 19.50 mmHg (SEM: 1.20). At least 50% of patients reached the significant threshold of 20% IOP reduction at every observation point except for month 6 follow-up. No significant reduction was achieved in the number of topical medications necessary to control glaucoma progression. Mean number of topical medications used at final follow-up is 3.00 (SEM: 0.134). Mean number of topical molecules preoperatively was 3.08 (SEM: 0.138). The discontinuation of oral acetazolamide was obtained with a statistically significant difference (p = 0.003).

665660,The Power of Antibody-Based Surveillance,2020-09-01,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected millions globally, with a continued need for effective treatments. N-acetylglucosamine has anti-inflammatory activities and modulates immune response. This study evaluated whether N-acetylglucosamine administered orally improves clinical outcomes for patients admitted to the hospital due to COVID-19. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This single-center, prospective, observational cohort study used a retrospective control group for comparison. Multivariate analyses evaluated whether N-acetylglucosamine was an independent predictor of primary outcomes (rate of intubation, hospital length-of-stay, and mortality) and select secondary outcomes (intensive care unit [ICU] admission, ICU length-of-stay, supplemental oxygen use duration, hospice initiation, and poor clinical outcome [defined as combined hospice initiation/death]). RESULTS: Of the 50 patients enrolled in the N-acetylglucosamine treatment group, 48 patients had follow-up data (50.0% [24/48] male; median age 63 years, range: 29–88). Multivariate analysis showed the treatment group had improved hospital length-of-stay (β: 4.27 [95% confidence interval (CI) −5.67; −2.85], p < 0.001), ICU admission (odds ratio [OR] 0.32 [95% CI 0.10; 0.96], p = 0.049), and poor clinical outcome (OR 0.30 [95% CI 0.09; 0.86], p = 0.034).

Nursing home (NH) residents have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and are prioritized for vaccination. NH residents are generally at increased risk of poor outcomes due to advanced age, frailty, and complex health conditions. We report monthly incidence rates of deaths, hospitalizations, and emergency department (ED) visits during ten pre-pandemic years (2010-2019) and 2020 to provide context for assessments of COVID-19 vaccine safety in NH residents. Methods. We observed deaths, hospitalizations, and ED visits among all Ontarians living in NHs using health administrative databases. Monthly incidence rates were calculated by month, by sex, and by age group. Direct comparisons between months were assessed using one-sample t-tests; direct comparisons by age and sex were assessed using chi-squared tests. Results. From January 1, 2010 through December 31, 2019, there were, on average, 83,453 (SD: 652.4) Ontarians living in NHs in any given month, with an average of 2.3 (SD: 0.28) deaths, 3.1 (SD: 0.16) hospitalizations, and 3.6 (SD: 0.17) ED visits per 100 residents per month. Mortality rates were higher for men (p<0.001) and residents aged [≥]80 years (p<0.001). Hospitalization and ED visit rates were higher for men but were lower for residents aged [≥]80 years. From January to October 2020, the number of NH residents declined markedly. Mortality rates were increased in 2020 compared to 2010-2019, but hospitalization and ED visit rates were reduced in 2020 compared to 2010-2019 (p<0.001). Conclusion. We identified relatively consistent monthly mortality, hospitalization, and ED visit rates during ten pre-pandemic years. Marked differences in these rates were observed during 2020, coinciding with heightened COID-19 infection rates and restrictions.

Despite extensive scientific research globally including repurposing of several existing drugs, there is no effective or proven therapy for this enigmatic disease which is still largely managed empirically This systematic review evaluated the role of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in the treatment of COVID‐19 infection and was conducted using Cochrane methodology for systematic reviews of interventional studies including risk of bias assessment and grading of the quality of evidence. Only prospective clinical trials randomly assigning COVID‐19 patients to HCQ plus standard of care therapy (test arm) versus placebo/standard of care (control arm) were included. Data were pooled using the random‐effects model and expressed as risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). A total of 10,492 patients from 19 randomised controlled trials were included. The use of HCQ was not associated with higher rates of clinical improvement (RR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.96–1.03, p = 0.79) or reduction in all‐cause mortality by Day14 (RR = 1.07, 95% CI: 0.97–1.19, p = 0.19) or Day28 (RR = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.99–1.19, p = 0.09) compared to placebo/standard of care. There was no significant difference in serious adverse events between the two arms (RR = 1.01, 95% CI: 0.85–1.19, p = 0.95). There is low‐to‐moderate certainty evidence that HCQ therapy is generally safe but does not reduce mortality or enhance recovery in patients with COVID‐19 infection.","Gupta, Tejpal; Thakkar, Prafulla; Kalra, Babusha; Kannan, Sadhana",Rev Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34245622/; https://doi.org/10.1002/rmv.2276,8

This retrospective study is performed in a Dutch teaching hospital with nursing facilities located in Rotterdam and Schiedam with around 45,000 admissions per year. From 3(rd) April to 11(th) May 2020 88 HCWs and 215 patients were diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Whole genome sequences were obtained for 30 HCWs and 20 patients. We found 7 sequence types in HCW and 11 in patients. Sequence Cluster A was the most predominant sequence type detected in 23 (77%) HCW, of whom 14 (74%) had direct patient contact and 9 (90%) with indirect patient contact. In addition, seven patients outside of the COVID-19 cohort isolation ward who became positive during their admission were infected with SARS-CoV-2 cluster A. Following universal masking of all HCWs and emphasis on physical distancing during meals and breaks, no further evidence was found for patient to HCW or HCW-to-HCW transmission or vice versa. The identification of genomic cluster A in patients and HCWs infected with SARS-CoV-2 by whole genome sequencing suggests transmission between HCWs, but also from HCWs to patients.","Paltansing, S.; Sikkema, R.S.; Man, S.J.de; Koopmans, M.P.G.; Munnink, B.B.

METHODS: This prospective data analysis was based on chart reviews for laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to ICUs over a 1-mo period. The NEWS2, CRB-65, qSOFA, and SIRS were calculated from the first recorded vital signs upon admission to ICU and assessed for predicting mortality. RESULTS: Total of 140 patients aged between 18 and 95 y were included in the analysis of whom majority were >60 y (47.8%), with evidence of pre-existing comorbidities (67.1%). The most common symptom at presentation was dyspnea (86.4%). Based upon the receiver operating characteristics area under the curve (AUC), the best discriminatory power to predict ICU mortality was for the CRB-65 (AUC: 0.720 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.630-0.811]) followed closely by NEWS2 (AUC: 0.712 [95% CI: 0.622-0.803]). Additionally, a multivariate Cox regression model showed Glasgow Coma Scale score at time of admission (P < 0.001; adjusted hazard ratio = 0.808 [95% CI: 0.715-0.911]) to be the only significant predictor of ICU mortality. CONCLUSIONS: CRB-65 and NEWS2 scores assessed at the time of ICU admission offer only a fair discriminatory value for predicting mortality. Further evaluation after adding laboratory markers such as C-reactive protein and D-dimer may yield a more useful prediction model. Much of the earlier data is from developed countries and uses scoring at time of hospital admission. This study was from a developing country, with the scores assessed at time of ICU admission, rather than the emergency department as with existing data from developed countries, for patients with moderate/severe COVID-19 disease. Because the scores showed some utility for predicting ICU mortality even when measured at time of ICU admission, their use in allocation of limited ICU resources in a developing country merits further research.","Tyagi, Asha; Tyagi, Surbhi; Agrawal, Ananya; Mohan, Aparna; Garg, Devansh; Salhotra, Rashmi; Saxena, Ashok Kumar; Goel, Ashish",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34140066/; https://doi.org/10.1017/dmp.2021.208,8

Along with hemodynamic changes such as prolonged clotting time, high fibrin degradation products and D-dimers, increased levels of monocytes with disturbed morphology have also been identified. In this study, through an integrated analysis of bulk RNA-sequencing data from Covid-19 patients with data from single-cell sequencing studies on lung tissues, we found that most of the cell-types that contributed to the altered gene expression were of hematopoietic origin. We also found that differentially expressed genes in Covid-19 patients formed a significant pool of the expressing genes in phagocytic cells such as Monocytes and Platelets. Interestingly, while we observed a general enrichment for Monocytes in Covid-19 patients, we found that the signal for FCGRA3+ Monocytes was depleted. Further, we found evidence that age-associated gene expression changes in Monocytes and Platelets, associated with inflammation, mirror gene expression changes in Covid-19 patients suggesting that pro-inflammatory signalling during aging may worsen the infection in older patients. We identified more than 20 genes that change in the same direction between Covid-19 infection and aging cells that may act as potential therapeutic targets. Of particular interest were IL2RG, GNLY and GMZA expressed in Platelets, which facilitates cytokine signalling in Monocytes through an interaction with Platelets. To understand whether infection can directly manipulate the biology of Monocytes and Platelets, we hypothesize that these non-ACE2 expressing cells may be infected by the virus through the phagocytic route. We observed that phagocytic cells such as Monocytes, T-cells, and Platelets have a significantly higher expression of genes that are a part of the Covid-19 viral interactome. Hence these cell-types may have an active rather than a reactive role in viral pathogenesis to manifest clinical symptoms such as coagulopathy. Therefore, our results present molecular evidence for pursuing both anti-inflammatory and anticoagulation therapy for better patient management especially in older patients.","Johri, S.; Jain, D.; Gupta, I.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.26.20081182; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.04.26.20081182v1?rss=1,8
669278,Targeted metabolomics identifies high performing diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for COVID-19,2021-07-19,"BACKGROUND: Stably expressed reference gene(s) normalization is important for the understanding of gene expression patterns by quantitative Real-time PCR (RT-qPCR), particularly for Rice stripe virus (RSV) and Rice black streaked dwarf virus (RBSDV) that caused seriously damage on rice plants in China and Southeast Asia. METHODS: The expression of fourteen common used reference genes of Oryza sativa L. were evaluated by RT-qPCR in RSV and RBSDV infected rice plants. Suitable normalization reference gene(s) were identified by geNorm and NormFinder algorithms. RESULTS: UBQ 10 + GAPDH and UBC + Actin1 were identified as suitable reference genes for RT-qPCR normalization under RSV and RBSDV infection, respectively. When using multiple reference genes, the expression patterns of OsPRIb and OsWRKY, two virus resistance genes, were approximately similar with that reported previously. Comparatively, by using single reference gene (TIP41-Like), a weaker inducible response was observed. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed that the combination of two reference genes could obtain more accurate and reliable normalization of RT-qPCR results in RSV- and RBSDV-infected plants. This work therefore sheds light on establishing a standardized RT-qPCR procedure in RSV- and RBSDV-infected rice plants, and might serve as an important point for discovering complex regulatory networks and identifying genes relevant to biological processes or implicated in virus.

Apart from respiratory complications, acute cerebrovascular disease (CVD) has been observed in some patients with COVID-19. Therefore, we described the clinical characteristics, laboratory features, treatment and outcomes of CVD complicating SARS-CoV-2 infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, treatments and clinical outcomes were collected and analysed. Clinical characteristics and laboratory findings of patients with COVID-19 with or without new-onset CVD were compared. RESULTS: Of 219 patients with COVID-19, 10 (4.6%) developed acute ischaemic stroke and 1 (0.5%) had intracerebral haemorrhage. COVID-19 with new onset of CVD were significantly older (75.7±10.8 years vs 52.1±15.3 years, p<0.001), more likely to present with severe COVID-19 (81.8% vs 39.9%, p<0.01) and were more likely to have cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes and medical history of CVD (all p<0.05). In addition, they were more likely to have increased inflammatory response and hypercoagulable state as reflected in C reactive protein (51.1 (1.3–127.9) vs 12.1 (0.1–212.0) mg/L, p<0.05) and D-dimer (6.9 (0.3–20.0) vs 0.5 (0.1–20.0) mg/L, p<0.001). Of 10 patients with ischemic stroke; 6 received antiplatelet treatment with aspirin or clopidogrel; and 3 of them died. The other four patients received anticoagulant treatment with enoxaparin and 2 of them died. As of 24 March 2020, six patients with CVD died (54.5%). CONCLUSION: Acute CVD is not uncommon in COVID-19. Our findings suggest that older patients with risk factors are more likely to develop CVD. The development of CVD is an important negative prognostic factor which requires further study to identify optimal management strategy to combat the COVID-19 outbreak.","Li, Yanan; Li, Man; Wang, Mengdie; Zhou, Yifan; Chang, Jiang; Xian, Ying; Wang, David; Mao, Ling; Jin, Huijuan; Hu, Bo",Stroke Vasc Neurol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32616524/; https://doi.org/10.1136/svn-2020-000431,8

Five of the 2,543 B.1.1.7 genomes had an E484K change in spike protein. Compared with non-B.1.1.7 patients, individuals infected with B.1.1.7 had a significantly lower cycle threshold value (considered to be a proxy for higher virus load) and higher rate of hospitalization. Other variants (e.g., B.1.429, B.1.427, P.1, P.2, and R.1) also increased rapidly in frequency, although the magnitude was less than for B.1.1.7.

METHODS: Baseline clinical and epidemiological information of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR confirmed cases detected between March 17(th)-May 4(th) in the San Pedro Sula Metropolitan area was collected, and, for hospitalized cases, clinical data was abstracted. Logistic regression models were fit to determine factors associated with hospitalization. RESULTS: 877 COVID-19 cases were identified of which 25% (n=220) were hospitalized. The 19-44-year age group (57.8%) and males (61.3%) were predominant in overall COVID-19 cases. 34% of the cases (n=299) had at least one pre-existing medical condition.

We investigated the nationwide effects of COVID-19 on the national Public-Private Mix (PPM) TB control project in Korea, using monitoring indicators from the Korean PPM monitoring database. METHODS: The Korean PPM monitoring database includes data from patients registered at PPM hospitals throughout the country. Data of six monitoring indicators for active TB cases updated between July 2019 and June 2020 were collected. The data of each cohort throughout the country and in Daegu-Gyeongbuk, Seoul Metropolitan Area, and Jeonnam-Jeonbuk were collated to provide nationwide data.

RESULTS: Test coverages of sputum smear (P = 0.622) and culture (P = 0.815), drug susceptibility test (P = 0.750), and adherence rate to initial standard treatment (P = 0.901) at the national level were not significantly different during the study period. The rate of loss to follow-up among TB cases at the national level was not significantly different (P = 0.088); however, the treatment success rate among the smear-positive drug-susceptible pulmonary TB cohort at the national level significantly decreased, from 90.6% to 84.1% (P < 0.001). Treatment success rate in the Seoul metropolitan area also significantly decreased during the study period, from 89.4% to 84.5% (P = 0.006).

Intriguing opportunity exists in combining the two modes of antiviral activity in the same polymer structure such that the same polymer acts as a microbicide and also serves to deliver the conjugated drug (ribavirin) into the cells. We explore this opportunity in detail and focus on the polymer backbone as a decisive constituent of such formulations. Fourteen polyanions (polycarboxylates, polyphosphates and polyphosphonates, and polysulfonates) were analyzed for blood pro/anti coagulation effects, albumin binding and albumin aggregation, inhibitory activity on polymerases, cytotoxicity, and anti-inflammatory activity in stimulated macrophages. Ribavirin containing monomers were designed to accommodate the synthesis of macromolecular prodrugs with disulfide-exchange triggered drug release. Kinetics of drug release was fast in all cases however enhanced hydrophobicity of the polymer significantly slowed release of ribavirin. Results of this study present a comprehensive view on polyanions as backbone for macromolecular prodrugs of ribavirin as broad-spectrum antiviral agents.","Zuwala, Kaja; Riber, Camilla F.; Løvschall, Kaja Borup; Andersen, Anna H.F.; Sørensen, Lise; Gajda, Paulina; Tolstrup, Martin; Zelikin, Alexander N.",J Control Release,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jconrel.2018.02.012; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168365918300725; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29432822/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0168365918300725,8

In a screen based on a yeast three-hybrid system using the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RNA as bait against a human cDNA library derived from HeLa cells, we found a positive candidate cellular protein, zinc finger CCHC-type and RNA-binding motif 1 (MADP1), to be able to interact with this region of the SARS-CoV genome. This interaction was subsequently confirmed in coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). The specificity of the interaction between MADP1 and the 5′-UTR of IBV was investigated and confirmed by using an RNA pull-down assay. The RNA-binding domain was mapped to the N-terminal region of MADP1 and the protein binding sequence to stem–loop I of IBV 5′-UTR. MADP1 was found to be translocated to the cytoplasm and partially co-localized with the viral replicase/transcriptase complexes (RTCs) in IBV-infected cells, deviating from its usual nuclear localization in a normal cell using indirect immunofluorescence.

School closure, one of the critical changes during the first COVID-19 wave, caused decreases in social contacts and increases in family time for children and adolescents. This can have both positive and negative influences on suicide, which is one of the robust mental health outcomes. However, the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on children and adolescents in terms of suicide is unknown. OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the acute effect of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic on suicide among children and adolescents during school closure in Japan. DATA: Total number of suicides per month among children and adolescents under 20 years old between January 2018 and May 2020. METHODS: Poisson regression was used to examine whether suicide increased or decreased during school closure, which spanned from March to May 2020, compared with the same period in 2018 and 2019. Robustness check was conducted using all data from January 2018 to May 2020. Negative binomial regression, a model with overdispersion, was also performed. RESULTS: We found no significant change in suicide rates during the school closure (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.81 to 1.64). We found the main effect of month, that is, suicides significantly increased suicides in May (IRR: 1.34, 95% CI: 1.01 to 1.78) compared to March, but the interaction terms of month and school closure were not significant (p > 0.1). CONCLUSIONS: As preliminary findings, this study suggests that the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has not significantly affected suicide rates among children and adolescents during the school closure in Japan.","Isumi, Aya; Doi, Satomi; Yamaoka, Yui; Takahashi, Kunihiko; Fujiwara, Takeo",Child Abuse Negl,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145213420303355; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2020.104680; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32847679/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0145213420303355,8

The challenge for policy makers consists of implementing a suitable approach to contain the outbreak and limit extra deaths without exhausting healthcare forces while mitigating the impact on the country's economy and on individuals' well-being. To better describe the trade-off between the economic, societal and public health dimensions, we developed an integrated bioeconomic optimization approach. We built a discrete age-structured model considering three main populations (youth, adults and seniors) and 8 socio-professional characteristics for the adults. Fifteen lockdown exit strategies were simulated for several options: abrupt or progressive (4 or 8 weeks) lockdown lift followed by total definitive transitory final unlocking. Three values of transmission rate (Tr) were considered to represent individuals' barrier gesture compliance. Optimization under constraint to find the best combination of scenarios and options was performed on the minimal total cost for production losses due to contracted activities and hospitalization in the short and mid-term, with 3 criteria: mortality, person-days locked and hospital saturation. The results clearly show little difference between the scenarios based on the economic impact or the 3 criteria. This means that policy makers should focus on individuals' behaviors (represented by the Tr value) more than on trying to optimize the lockdown strategy (defining who is unlocked and who is locked). For a given Tr, the choices of scenarios permit the management of the hospital saturation level with regard to both its intensity and its duration, which remains a key point for public health. The results highlight the need for behavioral or experimental economics to address COVID-19 issues through a better understanding of individual behavior motivations and the identification of ways to improve biosecurity compliance.","Ferchiou, Ahmed; Bornet, Remy; Lhermie, Guillaume; Raboisson, Didier",Front Public Health,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2020.606371; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33282820/,8

Yet, green infrastructure, as green roofs, provide multiple ecosystem services, as promoting citizens physical and psychological well-being. With the Coronavirus 19 world pandemic public spaces, like parks and other recreational areas, were closed and most citizens were confined to their dwellings. In this context, the need for outdoor space in the housing environment became more necessary than ever. This study is based on a survey performed to citizens living in 35 different countries to identify their access and value given to existing green areas in the home environment during and after confinement, and their willingness to pay (WTP) for an accessible green roof. Results indicate that 68% of respondents missed having a garden during the confinement and the outdoor space value increased after the confinement. Most are willing to pay for a medium sized accessible green roof and their WTP increases if the green area is bigger. WTP for medium sized green roofs is higher in other countries than in Portugal but not significantly different for larger green roofs. To promote private investment in green roofs, citizens WTP should be considered when designing new urban green infrastructure incentive policies.","Manso, Maria; Sousa, Vitor; Silva, Cristina Matos; Cruz, Carlos Oliveira",Journal of Building Engineering,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jobe.2021.103388; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2352710221012468; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352710221012468?v=s5,8

Given the athletic demands of soldiers, identification of myocarditis and characterization of post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection with cardiovascular symptoms (CV PASC) may be critical to guide return-to-service. This study sought to evaluate the spectrum of cardiac involvement among soldiers with cardiopulmonary symptoms in the late convalescent phase of recovery from SARS-CoV-2 compared to a healthy soldier control group, and to determine the rate of progression to CV PASC. METHODS: All soldiers referred for cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging for cardiopulmonary symptoms following COVID-19 were enrolled and matched by age, gender, and athletic phenotype 1:1 to soldiers undergoing CMR in the year prior to the first case of COVID-19 at our institution. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and imaging parameters were compared between groups. The diagnosis of acute myocarditis was made using modified Lake Louise criteria. Wilcoxon rank sum and chi-squared tests were used for comparison of continuous and categorical variables, respectively. RESULTS: Fifty soldier cases and 50 healthy soldier controls were included. The median time from SARS-CoV-2 detection to CMR was 71 days. The majority of cases experienced moderate symptoms (N = 43, 86%), while only 10% required hospitalization. The right ventricular (RV) ejection fraction (RVEF) was reduced in soldier cases compared to controls (51.0% vs. 53.2%, p = 0.012). Four cases were diagnosed with myocarditis (8%), 1 (2%) was diagnosed with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, and 1 (2%) had new biventricular systolic dysfunction of unclear etiology. Isolated inferior RV septal insertion late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) was present in 8 cases and 8 controls (16% vs. 24%, p = 0.09). Seven of the 19 (37%) cases that completed an intermediate-term follow-up survey reported CV PASC at a median of 139 days of follow-up. Two of the 7 soldiers (29%) with CV PASC had a pathological clinical diagnosis (myocarditis) on CMR. CONCLUSIONS: Cardiovascular pathology was diagnosed in 6 symptomatic soldiers (12%) after recovery from SARS-CoV-2, with myocarditis found in 4 (8%). RVEF was reduced in soldier cases compared to controls. CV PASC occurred in over one-third of soldiers surveyed, but did not occur in any soldiers with asymptomatic acute SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Clark, Daniel E.; Dendy, Jeffrey M.; Li, Dan L.; Crum, Kimberly; Dixon, Debra; George-Durrett, Kristen; Parikh, Amar P.; Wassenaar, Jean W.; Hughes, Sean G.; Soslow, Jonathan H.",J Cardiovasc Magn Reson,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12968-021-00798-1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34620179/,8
678724,Granulocyte-targeted therapies for airway diseases,2020-05-04,"INTRODUCTION: Symptoms may persist after the initial phases of COVID-19 infection, a phenomenon termed long COVID. Current knowledge on long COVID has been mostly derived from test-confirmed and hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Data are required on the burden and predictors of long COVID in a broader patient group, which includes both tested and untested COVID-19 patients in primary care. METHODS: This is an observational study using data from Platform C19, a quality improvement program-derived research database linking primary care electronic health record data (EHR) with patient-reported questionnaire information. Participating general practices invited consenting patients aged 18–85 to complete an online questionnaire since 7th August 2020. COVID-19 self-diagnosis, clinician-diagnosis, testing, and the presence and duration of symptoms were assessed via the questionnaire. Patients were considered present with long COVID if they reported symptoms lasting ≥4 weeks. EHR and questionnaire data up till 22nd January 2021 were extracted for analysis. Multivariable regression analyses were conducted comparing demographics, clinical characteristics, and presence of symptoms between patients with long COVID and patients with shorter symptom duration. RESULTS: Long COVID was present in 310/3151 (9.8%) patients with self-diagnosed, clinician-diagnosed, or test-confirmed COVID-19. Only 106/310 (34.2%) long COVID patients had test-confirmed COVID-19. Risk predictors of long COVID were age ≥40 years (adjusted Odds Ratio [AdjOR]=1.49 [1.05–2.17]), female sex (adjOR=1.37 [1.02–1.85]), frailty (adjOR=2.39 [1.29–4.27]), visit to A&E (adjOR=4.28 [2.31–7.78]), and hospital admission for COVID-19 symptoms (adjOR=3.22 [1.77–5.79]). Aches and pain (adjOR=1.70 [1.21–2.39]), appetite loss (adjOR=3.15 [1.78–5.92]), confusion and disorientation (adjOR=2.17 [1.57–2.99]), diarrhea (adjOR=1.4 [1.03–1.89]), and persistent dry cough (adjOR=2.77 [1.94–3.98]) were symptom features statistically more common in long COVID.

This study aimed to examine the upper lip position following cosmetic rhinoplasty at the frontal and profile views. The medical records of 67 patients who underwent rhinoplasty with no history of any facial skeletal surgery were obtained from archives. Complete preoperative and postoperative photos including the profile view at rest and the frontal view at rest, were prepared and analyzed using Adobe Photoshop CC 2015 software. Interpupillary distances of two eyes in frontal views and Glabella to Pogonion (POG) distance in profile views were considered as fixed landmarks to calibrate the preoperative and postoperative photos. Upper lip length, subnasal area, and vermilion points were marked and compared between preoperative and postoperative photos. Data analysis was carried out using one-sample t-test and p<0.05% was considered as the significant level. Lip length (frontal view) was increased in 46 subjects. There were changes in the profile view of vermilion and subnasal positions in 56 patients and 53 patients, respectively. In surgical procedures on columella strut, maxillary augment, alar resection, spreader graft, columella retraction, and depressor septi muscle release, vermilion and subnasal protrusion in the profile view was statistically significant and lip length increased significantly in the frontal view. In tip rotation surgery techniques, the vermilion and subnasal position showed also significant protrusion. The depressor septi muscle cutting methods had only led to a significant protrusion of vermilion position and upper lip length. Despite all covariant interfering in rhinoplasty, this cosmetic surgery most often may increases maxillary lip length and helps that maxilla looks more protruded.","Tosan, Foad; Esmaeelinejad, Mohammad; Ghorbani, Raheb",Br J Oral Maxillofac Surg,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0266435620303995?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33129584/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0266435620303995; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bjoms.2020.08.012,8

We also aimed to analyse the effectiveness of an unsupervised home-based exercise routine to counteract the potential increase in sedentary behaviour during the periods within the pandemic. A total of 18 noninstitutionalized older adults(78.4 ± 6.0 y.), members of the Spanish cohort of the EXERNET-Elder 3.0 project, participated in the study. They were recommended to perform an exercise prescription based on resistance, balance, and aerobic exercises during the pandemic. Wrist triaxial accelerometers (ActiGraph GT9X) were used to assess the percentage of sedentary time, physical activity, sedentary bouts and breaks of sedentary time. An ANOVA for repeated measures was performed to analyse the differences between the three different periods. During home quarantine, older adults spent more time in sedentary behaviours (71.6 ± 5.3%) in comparison with either the situation prior to the pandemic (65.5 ± 6.7%) or the ending of isolation (67.7 ± 7.1%) (all p < 0.05). Moreover, participants performed less bouts of physical activity and with a shorter duration during home quarantine (both p < 0.05). Additionally, no differences in the physical activity behaviours were found between the situation prior to the pandemic and the phase-0 of deescalation. According to our results, the home confinement could negatively affect health due to increased sedentary lifestyle and the reduction of physical activity. Therefore, our unsupervised exercise program does not seem to be a completely effective strategy at least in this period.","Fernández-García, Ángel I.; Marin-Puyalto, Jorge; Gómez-Cabello, Alba; Matute-Llorente, Ángel; Subías-Perié, Jorge; Pérez-Gómez, Jorge; Lozano-Berges, Gabriel; Mañas, Asier; Guadalupe-Grau, Amelia; González-Gross, Marcela; Ara, Ignacio; Casajús, José A.; Vicente-Rodríguez, Germán",Biomed Res Int,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/5528866; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34189136/,8

Current vaccines elicit neutralizing antibody responses to the virus spike derived from early isolates. However, new strains have emerged with multiple mutations: P.1 from Brazil, B.1.351 from South Africa and B.1.1.7 from the UK (12, 10 and 9 changes in the spike respectively). All have mutations in the ACE2 binding site with P.1 and B.1.351 having a virtually identical triplet: E484K, K417N/T and N501Y, which we show confer similar increased affinity for ACE2. We show that, surprisingly, P.1 is significantly less resistant to naturally acquired or vaccine induced antibody responses than B.1.351 suggesting that changes outside the RBD impact neutralisation. Monoclonal antibody 222 neutralises all three variants despite interacting with two of the ACE2 binding site mutations, we explain this through structural analysis and use the 222 light chain to largely restore neutralization potency to a major class of public antibodies.","Dejnirattisai, Wanwisa; Zhou, Daming; Supasa, Piyada; Liu, Chang; Mentzer, Alexander J.; Ginn, Helen M.; Zhao, Yuguang; Duyvesteyn, Helen M.E.; Tuekprakhon, Aekkachai; Nutalai, Rungtiwa; Wang, Beibei; Paesen, Guido C.; López-Camacho, César; Slon-Campos, Jose; Walter, Thomas S.; Skelly, Donal; Clemens, Sue Ann Costa; Naveca, Felipe Gomes; Nascimento, Valdinete; Nascimento, Fernanda; da Costa, Cristiano Fernandes; Resende, Paola C.; Pauvolid-Correa, Alex; Siqueira, Marilda M.; Dold, Christina; Levin, Robert; Dong, Tao; Pollard, Andrew J.; Knight, Julian C.; Crook, Derrick; Lambe, Teresa; Clutterbuck, Elizabeth; Bibi, Sagida; Flaxman, Amy; Bittaye, Mustapha; Belij-Rammerstorfer, Sandra; Gilbert, Sarah; Carroll, Miles W.; Klenerman, Paul; Barnes, Eleanor; Dunachie, Susanna J.; Paterson, Neil G.; Williams, Mark A.; Hall, David R.; Hulswit, Ruben J.

This study investigated demographic and clinical risk factors for severe disease and readmission among young adults 18–29 years old, who were diagnosed at a hospital encounter in Houston, Texas, USA. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A retrospective registry-based chart review was conducted investigating demographic and clinical risk factors for severe COVID-19 among patients aged 18–29 with positive SARS-CoV-2 tests within a large metropolitan healthcare system in Houston, Texas, USA. In the cohort of 1,853 young adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 infection at a hospital encounter, including 226 pregnant women, 1,438 (78%) scored 0 on the Charlson Comorbidity Index, and 833 (45%) were obese (≥30 kg/m(2)). Within 30 days of their diagnostic encounter, 316 (17%) patients were diagnosed with pneumonia, 148 (8%) received other severe disease diagnoses, and 268 (14%) returned to the hospital after being discharged home. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, increasing age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1–1.2, p<0.001), male gender (aOR 1.8, 95% CI 1.2–2.7, p = 0.002), Hispanic ethnicity (aOR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2–3.1, p = 0.01), obesity (3.1, 95% CI 1.9–5.1, p<0.001), asthma history (aOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3–4.0, p = 0.003), congestive heart failure (aOR 6.0, 95% CI 1.5–25.1, p = 0.01), cerebrovascular disease (aOR 4.9, 95% CI 1.7–14.7, p = 0.004), and diabetes (aOR 3.4, 95% CI 1.9–6.2, p<0.001) were predictive of severe disease diagnoses within 30 days.

680940,Infections in Pregnancy,2017-11-27,"SARS-CoV-2 infection causes cytokine storm and overshoot immunity in humans; however, it remains to be determined whether genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 and/or virus induced soluble mediators from lung epithelial cells as natural host are carried out by macrophages or other vehicles at distant organs causing tissue damage. We speculated that exosomes as extracellular vesicles are secreted from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells may transport messages to other cells of distant organs leading to pathogenic consequences. For this, we took an unbiased proteomic approach for analyses of exosomes isolated from plasma of healthy volunteers and SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. Our results revealed that tenascin-C (TNC) and fibrinogen-β (FGB) are highly abundant in exosomes from SARS-CoV-2 infected patient’s plasma as compared to that of healthy normal controls. Since TNC and FGB stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokines via NF-κB pathway, we examined the status of TNF-α, IL-6 and CCL5 expression upon exposure of hepatocytes to exosomes from COVID-19 patients and observed significant increase when compared with that from healthy subjects. Together, our results demonstrated that soluble mediators, like TNC and FGB, are transported through plasma exosomes in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and trigger pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in cells of distant organs in COVID-19 patients. Importance Exosomes play an important role in intercellular communication by inducing physiological changes in recipient cells by transferring bioactive proteins. Little is known about exosomes from SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and their role in pathogenesis. Here, we have carefully examined and analyzed this aspect of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results uncovered the potential mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 communicates with other cells of distant organs and promotes pathogenesis. We expect to detect whether other factors are modulated in the presence of COVID-19 exosomes. Our exosomes related proteomic experiments prioritize after initial verification to further examine their role in SARS-CoV-2 associated other pathogenic mechanisms to target for therapeutic modalities.","Sur, Subhayan; Khatun, Mousumi; Steele, Robert; Isbell, T.

681660,Melatonin in Cancer Treatment: Current Knowledge and Future Opportunities,2021-04-25,"BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a prevalent and debilitating mental health disorder. Among different therapeutic approaches (eg, medication and psychotherapy), psychotherapy in the form of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is considered the gold standard treatment for MDD. However, although efficacious, CBT is not readily accessible to many patients in need because of hurdles such as stigma, long wait times, high cost, the large time commitment for health care providers, and cultural or geographic barriers. Electronically delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (e-CBT) can effectively address many of these accessibility barriers. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the efficacy and feasibility of implementing an e-CBT program compared with in-person treatment for MDD. It is hypothesized that the e-CBT program will offer results comparable with those of the in-person treatment program, regarding symptom reduction and quality of life improvement. METHODS: This nonrandomized controlled trial intervention will provide e-CBT for MDD through the Online Psychotherapy Tool, a secure, cloud-based, digital mental health platform. Participants (aged 18-65 years) will be offered 12 weekly sessions of an e-CBT program tailored to MDD to address their depressive symptoms. Participants (n=55) will complete predesigned modules and homework assignments while receiving personalized feedback and interacting with a therapist through the platform. Using clinically validated symptomology questionnaires, the efficacy of the e-CBT program will be compared with that of a group (n=55) receiving in-person CBT. Questionnaires will be completed at baseline, at week 6 and week 12, and at a 6-month follow-up. Focus groups will be conducted to investigate personal, cultural, and social factors impacting the accessibility and feasibility of implementing a web-based psychotherapy tool from a patient and care provider perspective. Inclusion criteria include diagnosis of MDD, competence to consent to participate, ability to speak and read English, and consistent and reliable access to the internet. Exclusion criteria include active psychosis, acute mania, severe alcohol or substance use disorder, and active suicidal or homicidal ideation. RESULTS: Ethics approval was obtained in January 2019, and recruitment of participants began in June 2019. Recruitment has been conducted via social media, web-based communities, and physician referrals. To date, 52 participants have been recruited to the e-CBT group, and 48 patients have been recruited to the in-person CBT group. Data collection is expected to be completed by March 2021, and analyses are expected to be completed by June 2021, as linear regression (for continuous outcomes) and binomial regression analysis (for categorical outcomes) are still being conducted. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study can provide valuable information for the development of more accessible and scalable mental health interventions with increased care capacity for MDD, without sacrificing the quality of care.

During the first 7 months of the COVID-19 epidemic in Denver (March 6-October 6, 2020) the majority of adult COVID-19 cases (54.8%), hospitalizations (62.1%), and deaths (51.2%) were among persons identifying as Hispanic, more than double the proportion of Hispanic adults in the Denver community (24.9%) (1). Systemic drivers that influence how Hispanic persons live and work increase their exposure risks: compared with non-Hispanic persons, Hispanic persons with COVID-19 in Denver reported larger household sizes and were more likely to report known exposures to household and close contacts with COVID-19, working in an essential industry, and working while ill. Reducing the disproportionate incidence of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among Hispanic persons will require implementation of strategies that address upstream social and environmental factors that contribute to an increased risk for both infection and transmission and that facilitate improved access to culturally congruent care.","Podewils, Laura Jean; Burket, Tori L.; Mettenbrink, Christie; Steiner, Abigail; Seidel, Allison; Scott, Kenneth; Cervantes, Lilia; Hasnain-Wynia, Romana",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33270613/; https://doi.org/10.15585/mmwr.mm6948a3,8
682437,HLA-B27 is associated with reduced disease activity in axial spondyloarthritis,2021-06-10,"Ongoing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine development is focused on identifying stable, cost-effective, and accessible candidates for global use, specifically in low and middle-income countries. Here, we report the efficacy of a rapidly scalable, novel yeast expressed SARS-CoV-2 specific receptor-binding domain (RBD) based vaccine in rhesus macaques. We formulated the RBD immunogen in alum, a licensed and an emerging alum adsorbed TLR-7/8 targeted, 3M-052-alum adjuvants. The RBD+3M-052-alum adjuvanted vaccine promoted better RBD binding and effector antibodies, higher CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, improved Th1 biased CD4+T cell reactions, and increased CD8+ T cell responses when compared to the alum-alone adjuvanted vaccine. RBD+3M-052-alum induced a significant reduction of SARS-CoV-2 virus in respiratory tract upon challenge, accompanied by reduced lung inflammation when compared with unvaccinated controls. Anti-RBD antibody responses in vaccinated animals inversely correlated with viral load in nasal secretions and BAL. RBD+3M-052-alum blocked a post SARS-CoV-2 challenge increase in CD14+CD16++ intermediate blood monocytes, and Fractalkine, MCP-1, and TRAIL in the plasma. Decreased plasma analytes and intermediate monocyte frequencies correlated with reduced nasal and BAL viral loads. Lastly, RBD-specific plasma cells accumulated in the draining lymph nodes and not in the bone marrow, contrary to previous findings. Together, these data show that a yeast expressed, RBD-based vaccine+3M-052-alum provides robust immune responses and protection against SARS-CoV-2, making it a strong and scalable vaccine candidate.","Pino, Maria; Abid, Talha; Pereira Ribeiro, Susan; Edara, Venkata Viswanadh; Floyd, Katharine; Smith, Justin C; Latif, Muhammad Bilal; Pacheco-Sanchez, Gabriela; Dutta, Debashis; Wang, Shelly; Gumber, Sanjeev; Kirejczyk, Shannon; Cohen, Joyce; Stammen, Rachelle L; Jean, Sherrie M; Wood, Jennifer S; Connor-Stroud, Fawn; Pollet, Jeroen; Chen, Wen-Hsiang; Wei, Junfei; Zhan, Bin; Lee, Jungsoon; Liu, Zhuyun; Strych, Ulrich; Shenvi, Neeta; Easley, Kirk; Weiskopf, Daniela; Sette, Alessandro; Pollara, Justin; Mielke, Dieter; Gao, Hongmei; Eisel, Nathan; LaBranche, Celia C; Shen, Xiaoying; Ferrari, Guido; Tomaras, Georgia D; Montefiori, David C; Sekaly, Rafick P; Vanderford, Thomas H; Tomai, Mark A; Fox, Christopher B; Suthar, Mehul S; Kozlowski, Pamela A; Hotez, Peter J; Paiardini, Mirko; Bottazzi, Maria Elena; Kasturi, Sudhir Pai",Science immunology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34266981/; https://doi.org/10.1126/sciimmunol.abh3634,8

In accordance with the United Nations (2020), hotels must guarantee safe experiences for customers by incorporating sustainability measures. Collaboration between health and tourism authorities and the tourism industry is key. To test this proposal among hotels in Spain, 3 online focus groups and 25 personal interviews with 36 urban and 28 rural hotels were held in order to define the indicators. The questionnaire was applied to a sample of 475 urban hotels out of 443 rural hotels. The conclusions were: 1.) While in urban areas the testing protocols, especially for workers, are followed by most hotels, in rural areas hotel managers do not consider it as a priority in daily activity due to the reduced contact they have. 2.) A change in trends in the sustainable management of both rural and urban hotels is justified. 3.) Urban and rural hotels are more likely to incorporate collaborative strategies with tourism and health authorities to reduce the negative impact of COVID-19. According to the estimates of the hotels, the implementation of these measures would help to start the recovery process of the hotel industry.","Robina-Ramírez, Rafael; Medina-Merodio, José Amelio; Estriegana, Rosa",Cities,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264275121003917; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264275121003917?v=s5,8

A general awareness of COVID-19 infection is addressed, and it is compared with the Spanish flu pandemic. Based on the successes, failures and lessons learned in the past, governmental efforts must be undertaken to empower citizens by providing accurate information and implementing post-COVID-19 precautions that need to be taken now to stop the spread and recurrence of the virus locally, and to restore health and economic normalcy. METHODS: A detailed literature survey of past pandemics is undertaken in order to extract the successes, failures and lessons learned from previous breakouts. The comparison of past pandemics will enable us to determine post-COVID-19 precautions that should be followed. Separate tables are prepared to highlight the lessons learned and measures to be taken. Both general precautions and preventive measures for pregnant women are compiled. RESULTS: The literature shows a continuous struggle of humans with disease outbreaks, with the most adverse impact of the Spanish flu killing 20–50 million people. Precautions need to be taken including social distancing, compulsory mask-wearing, avoiding public gatherings and washing hands regularly. The lessons from earlier pandemics show that they were equally devastating, and vaccines were not available at the time of outbreaks. Vaccines developed for polio, H1N1, measles, and other viral diseases have proven to save countless lives. Living with COVID-19 and evolving the work culture of protecting oneself and protecting others also has to be adopted. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 has become an everyday topic of discussion throughout the world, indicating the increasing number of COVID-19 cases, deaths and recoveries. The lessons learned from past pandemics such as social distancing, wearing masks, avoiding public gatherings and adherence to guidelines, along with personal hygiene, are the key measures that must be taken in order to live with COVID-19. Precautions for the elderly and pregnant women advised by medical authorities are to be strictly adhered to. These will help in reducing COVID-19 cases and in turn will reduce the pressure on hospitals to serve those in need. India has learned lessons from the past and the present pandemic and will move towards growth through its self-reliance.","Munnoli, Prakash Mallappa; Nabapure, S.; Yeshavanth, G.",Z Gesundh Wiss,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837846/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10389-020-01371-3,8

Here, a periodic paired gold nanostructure exploiting surface plasmon resonance is proposed, which shows promising results for Refractive Index (RI) detection due to its high electric field confinement and diffraction limit. Here, single and paired gold nanostructured sensors were designed for real-time RI detection. The Full-Width at Half-Maximum (FWHM) and Figure-Of-Merit (FOM) were also calculated, which relate the sensitivity to the sharpness of the peak. The effect of different possible structural shapes and dimensions were studied to optimise the sensitivity response of nanosensing structures and identify an optimised elliptical nanoantenna with the major axis a, minor axis b, gap between the pair g, and heights h being 100 nm, 10 nm, 10 nm, and 40 nm, respectively. In this work, we investigated the bulk sensitivity, which is the spectral shift per refractive index unit due to the change in the surrounding material, and this value was calculated as 526-530 nm/RIU, while the FWHM was calculated around 110 nm with a FOM of 8.1. On the other hand, the surface sensing was related to the spectral shift due to the refractive index variation of the surface layer near the paired nanoantenna surface, and this value for the same antenna pair was calculated as 250 nm/RIU for a surface layer thickness of 4.5 nm.","Verma, Sneha; Ghosh, Souvik; Rahman, B M A",Sensors,https://doi.org/10.3390/s21186166; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34577373/,8

685202,COVID-19 and pneumonia: a role for the uPA/uPAR system,2020-06-18,"BACKGROUND: With the development of digital media, online activities are increasingly becoming part of the daily life of older adults. Widowed older adults generally would face changes in social interactions and activities due to widowhood; thus, the importance of online participation may be more prominent in this population. However, a detailed evidence on the experiences of online social participation among widowed older adults is relatively sparse. This study aimed to explore widowed older adults’ perceptions regarding online social participation in southwestern China. METHODS: This study adopted a qualitative approach. Semi-structured, in-depth individual interviews were conducted with 19 widowed older adults between September–December 2020. Thematic analysis was applied to analyse the data. RESULTS: Two major themes, “benefits” and “barriers” were identified from the original data analysis. Subcategories concerning the theme “benefits” were “benefit perception (convenience, flexible time, supplementation)”, “health promotion”, “emotional comfort”, and “social connection”. Subcategories of “barriers” were “worries: personal economic loss”, “concerns: security of digital device”, “troubles: the diversity of online social participation”, and “difficulties: using digital media”. CONCLUSIONS: Social participation of widowed older adults in southwestern China has begun to be integrated into the digital world; however, it remains at an early stage with the simple purpose of engagement. The older adults may face many challenges for online social participation. Although there are barriers and challenges in online social participation, widowed older adults can reap its benefits, which can be used as an important measure to facilitate a fulfilling life and successful ageing. There is no doubt that online social participation will become a trend within the foreseeable future. Family, friends and health care professionals should pay more attention to the needs of online social participation in widowed older adults and provide adequate support for them to achieve a meaningful life.","Hong, Yan; Fu, Jingjing; Kong, Dehui; Liu, Siqi; Zhong, Zhu; Tan, Jing; Luo, Yu",BMC Geriatr,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12877-021-02381-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34344309/,8

Our neuropsychological theory of anxiety, recently supported by human imaging, is founded on a longstanding, reliable, rodent ‘theta’ brain rhythm model of human clinical anxiolytic drug action. We have now developed a human scalp EEG homolog—goal-conflict-specific rhythmicity (GCSR), i.e., EEG rhythmicity specific to a balanced conflict between goals (e.g., approach-avoidance). Critically, GCSR is consistently reduced by different classes of anxiolytic drug and correlates with clinically-relevant trait anxiety scores (STAI-T). Here we show elevated GCSR in student volunteers divided, after testing, on their STAI-T scores into low, medium, and high (typical of clinical anxiety) groups. We then tested anxiety disorder patients (meeting diagnostic criteria) and similar controls recruited separately from the community. The patient group had higher average GCSR than their controls—with a mixture of high and low GCSR that varied with, but cut across, conventional disorder diagnosis. Consequently, GCSR scores should provide the first theoretically-based biomarker that could help diagnose, and so redefine, a psychiatric disorder.","Shadli, Shabah M.; Ando, Lynne C.; McIntosh, Julia; Lodhia, Veema; Russell, Bruce R.; Kirk, Ian J.; Glue, Paul; McNaughton, Neil",Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-99374-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34611294/,8

OBJECTIVE: We examined the language used by the members of the US House and Senate during the first 10 months of the COVID-19 pandemic and measured content and sentiment based on the tweets that they shared. METHODS: We used Quorum (Quorum Analytics Inc) to access more than 300,000 tweets posted by US legislators from January 1 to October 10, 2020. We used differential language analyses to compare the content and sentiment of tweets posted by legislators based on their party affiliation. RESULTS: We found that health care–related themes in Democratic legislators’ tweets focused on racial disparities in care (odds ratio [OR] 2.24, 95% CI 2.22-2.27; P<.001), health care and insurance (OR 1.74, 95% CI 1.7-1.77; P<.001), COVID-19 testing (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.12-1.19; P<.001), and public health guidelines (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.22-1.29; P<.001).
