182,Activation of the Unfolded Protein Response Is Required for Defenses against Bacterial Pore-Forming Toxin In Vivo,2008-10-10,"Pore-forming toxins (PFTs) constitute the single largest class of proteinaceous bacterial virulence factors and are made by many of the most important bacterial pathogens. Host responses to these toxins are complex and poorly understood. We find that the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated upon exposure to PFTs both in Caenorhabditis elegans and in mammalian cells. Activation of the UPR is protective in vivo against PFTs since animals that lack either the ire-1-xbp-1 or the atf-6 arms of the UPR are more sensitive to PFT than wild-type animals. The UPR acts directly in the cells targeted by the PFT. Loss of the UPR leads to a normal response against unrelated toxins or a pathogenic bacterium, indicating its PFT-protective role is specific. The p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAPK) kinase pathway has been previously shown to be important for cellular defenses against PFTs. We find here that the UPR is one of the key downstream targets of the p38 MAPK pathway in response to PFT since loss of a functional p38 MAPK pathway leads to a failure of PFT to properly activate the ire-1-xbp-1 arm of the UPR. The UPR-mediated activation and response to PFTs is distinct from the canonical UPR-mediated response to unfolded proteins both in terms of its activation and functional sensitivities. These data demonstrate that the UPR, a fundamental intracellular pathway, can operate in intrinsic cellular defenses against bacterial attack.","Bischof, Larry J.; Kao, Cheng-Yuan; Los, Ferdinand C.

10628,Mitteilungen des GRC,2020-04-29,"Despite being similar in structure, functioning, and size, viral pathogens enjoy very different, usually well-defined ways of life. They occupy their hosts for a few days (influenza), for a few weeks (measles), or even lifelong (HCV), which manifests in acute or chronic infections. The various transmission routes (airborne, via direct physical contact, etc.), degrees of infectiousness (referring to the viral load required for transmission), antigenic variation/immune escape and virulence define further aspects of pathogenic lifestyles. To survive, pathogens must infect new hosts; the success determines their fitness. Infection happens with a certain likelihood during contact of hosts, where contact can also be mediated by vectors. Besides structural aspects of the host-contact network, three parameters appear to be key: the contact rate and the infectiousness during contact, which encode the mode of transmission, and third the immunity of susceptible hosts. On these grounds, what can be said about the reproductive success of viral pathogens? This is the biological question addressed in this paper. The answer extends earlier results of the author and makes explicit connection to another basic work on the evolution of pathogens. A mathematical framework is presented that models intra- and inter-host dynamics in a minimalistic but unified fashion covering a broad spectrum of viral pathogens, including those that cause flu-like infections, childhood diseases, and sexually transmitted infections. These pathogens turn out as local maxima of numerically simulated fitness landscapes. The models involve differential and integral equations, agent-based simulation, networks, and probability.","Lange, Alexander",Bull Math Biol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7189636/,554

Our aim was to compare the effect of these two modes on oxygenation in infants with evolving or established bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Two-hour periods of PAV and NAVA were delivered in random order to 18 infants born less than 32 weeks of gestation. Quasi oxygenation indices (“OI”) and alveolar-arterial (“A-a”) oxygen gradients at the end of each period on PAV, NAVA and baseline ventilation were calculated using capillary blood samples. The mean “OI” was not significantly different on PAV compared to NAVA (7.8 (standard deviation (SD) 3.2) versus 8.1 (SD 3.4), respectively, p = 0.70, but lower on both than on baseline ventilation (mean baseline “OI” 11.0 (SD 5.0)), p = 0.002, 0.004, respectively). The “A-a” oxygen gradient was higher on PAV and baseline ventilation than on NAVA (20.8 (SD 12.3) and 22.9 (SD 11.8) versus 18.5 (SD 10.8) kPa, p = 0.015, < 0.001, respectively). Conclusion: Both NAVA and PAV improved oxygenation compared to conventional ventilation. There was no significant difference in the mean “OI” between the two modes, but the mean “A-a” gradient was better on NAVA.","Hunt, Katie A.; Dassios, Theodore; Greenough, Anne",Eur J Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7220976/,554

The Jingmenvirus (JMV) group holds a special place among flaviviruses and flavi-like viruses because they have a segmented ssRNA(+) genome. We detected Alongshan virus (ALSV), which is a representative of the JMV group, in ten pools of adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks collected in two geographically-separated Russian regions. Three of the ten strains were isolated in the tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Most ALSV virions purified from tick cells were spherical with a diameter of approximately 40.5 nm. In addition, we found smaller particles of approximately 13.1 nm in diameter. We obtained full genome sequences of all four segments of two of the isolated ALSV strains, and partial sequences of one segment from the third strain. Phylogenetic analysis on genome segment 2 of the JMV group clustered our novel strains with other ALSV strains.

11701,HZV: Engmaschige Kontrolle von COVID-19-Patienten: Neues Software-Modul,2020-05-28,"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a syndrome of excessive immune system activation driven mainly by high levels of interferon gamma. The clinical presentation of HLH can have considerable overlap with other inflammatory conditions. We present a cohort of patients with therapy refractory HLH referred to our center who were found to have a simultaneous presentation of complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA). Twenty-three patients had therapy refractory HLH (13 primary, 4 EVB-HLH, 6 HLH without known trigger). Sixteen (69.6%) met high-risk TMA criteria. Renal failure requiring renal replacement therapy, severe hypertension, serositis, and gastrointestinal bleeding were documented only in patients with HLH who had concomitant complement-mediated TMA. Patients with HLH and without TMA required ventilator support mainly due to CNS symptoms, while those with HLH and TMA had respiratory failure predominantly associated with pulmonary hypertension, a known presentation of pulmonary TMA. Ten patients received eculizumab for complement-mediated TMA management while being treated for HLH. All patients who received the complement blocker eculizumab in addition to the interferon gamma blocker emapalumab had complete resolution of their TMA and survived. Our observations suggest co-activation of both interferon and complement pathways as a potential culprit in the evolution of thrombotic microangiopathy in patients with inflammatory disorders like refractory HLH and may offer novel therapeutic approaches for these critically ill patients. TMA should be considered in children with HLH and multi-organ failure, as an early institution of a brief course of complement blocking therapy in addition to HLH-targeted therapy may improve clinical outcomes in these patients.

The drug targeting to the small intestine can be achieved via nanoparticles for its optimum bioavailability within the systemic circulation. The small intestine is a remarkable candidate for localized drug delivery. The intestine has its unique properties. It has a less harsh environment than the stomach, provides comparatively more retention time, and possesses a greater surface area than other parts of the gastrointestinal tract. This review focuses on elaborating the intestinal barriers and approaches to overcome these barriers for internalizing nanoparticles and adopting different cellular trafficking pathways. We have discussed various factors that contribute to nanocarriers’ cellular uptake, including their surface chemistry, surface morphology, and functionalization of nanoparticles. Furthermore, the fate of nanoparticles after their uptake at cellular and subcellular levels is also briefly explained.

Data collection was conducted through in-depth and semi-structured interviews until reaching data saturation. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, imported into the Open Code Software, and analyzed using the Graneheim and Lundman methods. RESULTS: The results included two main categories: (1) threats to the psychological integrity; (2) development of capabilities. The first main category comprised the sub-categories of “care-related negative feelings and emotions,” care-related stress and its behavioral impacts on care, “psychological disorders arising from care provision,” and “impaired quality and quantity of sleep.” The second main category comprised of the sub-categories of “care-related positive feelings and emotions” and “coping strategies.” CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that though caring for hemodialysis patients threatens the caregiver’s psychological integrity, it provides the opportunity of development capabilities.","Ebadi, Abbas; Sajadi, Seyedeh Azam; Moradian, Seyed Tayeb; Akbari, Roghayeh",BMC Psychol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8496675/,554

The gastrointestinal tract, however, although also a target for SARS-CoV replication, is obviously not affected by cell death mechanisms. Such differences in cell death induction are paralleled by in-vitro studies. In a colon-derived cell line (Caco-2), proapoptotic proteins were down- and antiapoptotic proteins were upregulated during SARS-CoV infection. By contrast, in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells, apoptosis was induced via the p38 MAPK and caspase dependent pathways. Both apoptotic pathways, although mostly the intrinsic signal transduction, can be targeted by structural as well as accessory proteins of SARS-CoV. The fact that all structural and most of the accessory proteins of SARS-CoV are implicated in apoptotic scenarios indicates the fundamental role of apoptosis in the SARS-CoV life cycle. Interestingly, at least for the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV, a cell-type specific manipulation of apoptosis was confirmed.","Diemer, Claudia; Schneider, Martha; Schätzl, Hermann M.; Gilch, Sabine",Molecular Biology of the SARS-Coronavirus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7176189/,554

Seeing and viewing provide concepts for understanding how values change in the midst of fears concerning contagion through physical contact that are mollified through the use of technology analogous to video conferencing.

However, the genotypes of EV71 isolates in China are still not completely clear. METHODS: The VP1 gene sequences of 3712 EV71 virus strains from China, excluding repetitive sequences and 30 known EV71 genotypes as reference strains, between 1986 and 2019 were obtained from GenBank. Phylogenetic tree, amino acid homology, genetic variation and genotype analyses of the EV71VP1 protein were performed with MEGA 6.0 software. RESULTS: The amino acid identity was found to be 88.33%–100% among the 3712 EV71 strains, 93.47%–100% compared with vaccine strain H07, and 93.04%–100% compared with vaccine strains FY7VP5 or FY-23 K-B. Since 2000, the prevalent strains of EV71 were mainly of the C4 genotype. Among these, the C4a subgenotype was predominant, followed by the C4b subgenotype; other subgenotypes appeared sporadically between 2005 and 2018 in mainland China. The B4 genotype was the main genotype in Taiwan, and the epidemic strains were constantly changing. Some amino acid variations in VP1 of EV71 occurred with high frequencies, including A289T (20.99%), H22Q (16.49%), A293S (15.95%), S283T (15.11%), V249I (7.76%), N31D (7.25%), and E98K (6.65%). CONCLUSION: The C4 genotype of EV71 in China matches the vaccine and should effectively control EV71. However, the efficacy of the vaccine is partially affected by the continuous change in epidemic strains in Taiwan. These results suggest that the genetic characteristics of the EV71-VP1 region should be continuously monitored, which is critical for epidemic control and vaccine design to prevent EV71 infection in children.","Sun, Haiyan; Gao, Min; Cui, Dawei",Gut Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7427758/,554

As climate impacts intensify, advocates are promoting larger, ecosystem-scale strategies to help mitigate flood risks. Yet, research on existing urban greening projects finds that they can cause gentrification and displacement, suggesting that smaller projects may be more desirable from an equity perspective. This essay argues that cities need both large-scale and justice-enhancing nature-based solutions. They can help overcome tensions in these goals by (1) reframing green infrastructure as a way to support community development and integrated socio-ecological landscapes, and (2) advancing metropolitan regional governance strategies that alleviate municipal fiscal imperatives to maximize local land development. These proposals suggest that the practice of green infrastructure would benefit from diversifying its ranks to include social and government policy, community development, and agroecology, as well as learning from the Global South and those currently positioned as “off the map” of technical expertise. They also point to the need for interdisciplinary research that provides an evidence base for more transformative social, ecological, and governance strategies. While the essay focuses on the US context, it is relevant to an international audience given that similar challenges confront cities worldwide and that it highlights how the Global North can learn from the Global South.","Shi, Linda",Socio Ecol Pract Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7474504/,554

42692,Concise Read-Only Specifications for Better Synthesis of Programs with Pointers,2020-04-18,"BACKGROUND: Oesophageal carcinoma (EC) is the eighth most common cancer. Surgery is the cornerstone of management for resectable EC. Trans-thoracic oesophagectomy (TTE) and trans-hiatal oesophagectomy (THE) are the two most widely practised procedures. Most of the related controversies are centred on both early and late post-operative complications and mortality (in terms of overall survival and cancer-free survival). This was a single-centre, retrospective, comparative study analysing the outcomes of two EC resection methods. All 87 patients underwent surgery by the same surgical team over 13 years. Consequently, 87 oesophagectomies with curative intent were performed and divided into the TTE group (group A = 47) and the THE group (group B = 40). RESULTS: The mean patient age was 65.60 ± 6.30 years in the TTE group and 63.48 ± 9.34 years in the THE group. No significant difference was found in operative time, blood loss or duration of stay in the intensive care unit. The duration of hospital stay was significantly different between the THE and TTE groups (17.25 ± 5.92 vs. 12.93 ± 3.44, respectively; P ≤ 0.001). In-hospital mortality was higher in the TTE group (9/47, 19.14%) than in the THE group (5/40, 12.5%) (P = 0.400). The mean survival rate from our series showed the superiority of group A (TTE) (65.56 months) over group B (THE) (45.01 months), with P = 0.146. CONCLUSION: No high level of evidence suggests the superiority of one surgical procedure over another. The THE procedure is less time-consuming concerning care and follow-up, and most patients were more satisfied and experienced less pain than with the TTE procedure. Both THE and TTE have comparable post-operative anastomotic complications, and they have no significant long-term survival differences.","Baram, Aram; Sherzad, Hiwa",Cardiothorac Surg,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7686938/,554

The backdoor attack, an emerging one among these malicious attacks, attracts a lot of research attentions in detecting it because of its severe consequences. Latest backdoor detections have made great progress by reconstructing backdoor triggers and performing the corresponding outlier detection. Although they are effective on existing triggers, they still fall short of detecting stealthy ones which are proposed in this work. New triggers of our backdoor attack can be generally inserted into DL models through a hidden and reconstruction-resistant manner. We evaluate our attack against two state-of-the-art detections on three different data sets, and demonstrate that our attack is able to successfully insert target backdoors and also escape the detections. We hope our design is able to shed some light on how the backdoor detection should be advanced along this line in future.","Xiong, Yayuan; Xu, Fengyuan; Zhong, Sheng; Li, Qun",ICT Systems Security and Privacy Protection,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7978978/,554

This paper expands the concept of SSI and describes the possibilities and problems when applying it to self-content management using the concept of Self-Content Management (SCM). In particular, I discuss the possibility of self-sovereign management of digital content, and discuss DRM using blockchain technology as a means. This paper is assumed that SSI can be applied to content created by myself, but by properly managing content using blockchain technology, it is possible to complete licenses and levy fees. I also clarified that it could be a substitute for the resale right. As a result, SCM promoted the problem of “orphans’ works” and facilitated the processing of rights, and revealed that it could contribute to the further development of culture. However, I also address that there are two issues. One is the lack of institutional trust, rather than the technical credibility of the blockchain.

It makes a call for a holistic approach in addressing the rights of such individuals, who are believed to form a considerable proportion of the total population in both countries, if not the majority. The article’s central argument is framed in the context of the developing norm of the right to dual nationality of those who have recognised origins in more than one country. It gleans insights from international and comparative law perspectives, by looking into the practice of some states that allow dual nationality. The argument aligns with fundamental principles of equality and the right to non-discrimination based on one’s national origin, as enshrined in various instruments of International Human Rights Law (IHRL). By making an explicit call for the recognition of dual nationality of individuals with Eritrean and Ethiopian ancestry, the article also argues that attendant questions and answers surrounding the issue of cross-border identity need to be ironed out in a sustainable manner in forthcoming rounds of negotiations between the governments of the two countries.

Today, the medical profession worldwide seems in a heightened state of discontent, but their chosen directions to fight back over their conditions of labor appear blurry and ineffective. With the continual increase in corporatization schemes, physicians continue to be drawn into the role of employee of ever-larger organizations which leave the independent physician-run practice behind; it has become financially more and more difficult to maintain a practice while procuring sufficient reimbursement from insurance companies and patients. As a result, they are not able to maintain their professional independence, which would allow them to act as their patient’s agent in determining what would be done and where it would be done. Because they now have to obey the corporate mandate of revenue enhancement and cost cutting, they no longer have free rein to do as they wish in their professional practice.

Waste is defined not simply as unwanted or unusable material but more broadly as “material in the wrong place at the wrong time.” Earth is the first of three “trash cans” that humankind has created as a result of its inability to deal with its waste. Illustrated examples establish the amount of land available to support us, the general magnitude of the solid waste problem, and the inherent disparity between the two. Air, the earth’s atmosphere, is the second “can” used to take up the lighter-than-air waste byproducts created by human activity. The evidence of an increase in greenhouse gasses correlates to the pronounced rise of fossil fuel-driven industrial production since the late 1700s through the present day. CO(2), tropospheric and stratospheric ozone problems, and methane are discussed. Water comprises the third and final “trash can” survey, from solid waste fouling our waterways that ends up slowly churning in the great Pacific gyre to agricultural and industrial chemical elements and compounds that reduce the ability of the oceans, lakes, rivers, streams, and underground aquifers to support life.

METHODS: Clinical data and laboratory indicators of 82 patients with CAP and 40 healthy subjects were retrospectively analysed. The relationship among CAR, FAR, and the severity of CAP was then analysed. RESULTS: CAR and FAR in patients with low-risk CAP were significantly higher than those in the normal control group (P < 0.05). CAR and FAR in patients with medium–high-risk CAP were further increased compared with those in patients with low-risk CAP (P < 0.05). CAR and FAR were positively correlated with hypersensitive C-reactive protein, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and CURB-65 scores (P < 0.05). In the receiver operating characteristic curve for predicting severe CAP, the area under the curve of combining four biomarkers (CAR + FAR + NLR + PLR) was the largest. CAR was also an independent risk factor for severe CAP (OR = 8.789, 95% CI: 1.543–50.064, P = 0.014).

It is critical to have an accurate estimate of its parameters, as it will impact the company’s revenue. The learning has to be performed very efficiently using a small window of a few test points, because of the rapid changes in price demand parameters due to seasonality and fluctuations. However, there are conflicting goals when seeking the two objectives of revenue maximization and demand learning, known as the learn/earn trade-off. This is akin to the exploration/exploitation trade-off that we encounter in machine learning and optimization algorithms. In this paper, we consider the problem of price demand function estimation, taking into account its exploration–exploitation characteristic. We design a new objective function that combines both aspects. This objective function is essentially the revenue minus a term that measures the error in parameter estimates. Recursive algorithms that optimize this objective function are derived.

RECENT FINDINGS According to several randomized controlled trials, NIV has gained acceptance as the preferred ventilatory modality to treat acute respiratory failure (ARF) due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations, cardiogenic pulmonary edema, respiratory failure in immunocompromised patients, and to decrease the intubation length and to improve weaning results in patients recovering from a hypercapnic respiratory failure. Observational studies suggest that NIV may also be used to treat other conditions like severe pneumonia (including H1N1 virus), severe asthma attack, cystic fibrosis, obesity hypoventilation, and to improve the respiratory outcome in postsurgical patients. SUMMARY NIV has radically changed the management of ARF. Recently the possible applications of NIV have increased, both in the hospital and extrahospital setting. NIV is no longer confined to the ICU, but has crossed over into the regular ward, Emergency Department and 'out-of-hospital' environment. Current research is focusing on improving the quality and safety of the devices and establishing new ventilatory modes in order to extend even further the indications to NIV as well as its rate of success.","Boldrini, Rossella; Fasano, Luca; Nava, Stefano",Current opinion in critical care,https://doi.org/10.1097/mcc.0b013e32834ebd71; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22186215/,554

To date, these political transitions have largely been analysed independently. While the transition in Sudan is often characterised as a revolution, events in Ethiopia are not usually so described. However, despite the narrative and substantive differences, this article argues that there are important similarities in both countries’ contextual circumstances and processes of change. These include the trajectory of concurrent decline of the previous regimes, elements of continuity of the new transitional governments with the previous regimes, societal, especially youth, expectations of change, the rise of a new generation of political leadership, the role of women, the continuing difficulties and challenges of subnational politics, the persistence of economic drivers of political change and discontent, and, most recently, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, developments in both countries inform and reinforce each other, with consequences for stability and conflict, as the recent prospect of a Sudan-Ethiopia border war starkly demonstrates.

The aim of the current investigation was to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched pathways in COVID-19 infection and its associated complications by bioinformatics analysis, and to provide potential targets for diagnosis and treatment. Valid next-generation sequencing (NGS) data of 93 COVID 19 samples and 100 non COVID 19 samples (GSE156063) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Gene ontology (GO) and REACTOME pathway enrichment analysis was conducted to identify the biological role of DEGs. In addition, a protein-protein interaction network, modules, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network, TF-hub gene regulatory network and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were used to identify the key genes. A total of 738 DEGs were identified, including 415 up regulated genes and 323 down regulated genes. Most of the DEGs were significantly enriched in immune system process, cell communication, immune system and signaling by NTRK1 (TRKA). Through PPI, modules, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network, TF-hub gene regulatory network analysis, ESR1, UBD, FYN, STAT1, ISG15, EGR1, ARRB2, UBE2D1, PRKDC and FOS were selected as hub genes, which were expressed in COVID-19 samples relative to those in non COVID-19 samples, respectively.

This study was designed to assess the preliminary impact of the proposed Eko Atlantic City (EAC) project on the aquatic lives and/or biodiversity, and the level of development and challenges that have implications on climate change in Victoria Island and its environs in Lagos State, Nigeria. The selected areas such as Lamgbasa, Badore, Ajah and Victoria Island were evaluated using the snowball sampling approach, whereby 111 respondents were assessed. Results showed that land reclamation and construction activities had impacted on the aquatic lives and the primitive fishing occupation (5.5%). Respondents (44.4%) agreed that the on-going EAC had contributed to the development of Lagos State, however, negative impacts of climate change such as ocean surge, sea level rise, flooding among others were high but with low level of adaptive capacity agreement (41.7%). Furthermore, analysis showed varying degrees in the extent of severity of problems encountered from climate change effects such as rainfall, flooding, temperature, health issues among others. The study revealed that these communities were susceptible or vulnerable to the impacts of climate change such as coastal erosion, flooding, storm/ocean surge, sea level rise etc and importantly loss of non- renewable aquatic genetic resources. The government is hereby advised to have sound policies for adaptation and mitigation strategies to protect these non-renewable genetic resources and effect of climate change activities.","Olaniyi, W.

Virtually all sectors experienced a negative impact, which forced the transformation of many enterprises. In the case of the ICT sector, new environmental conditions pose a threat but also a development perspective, which forces ICT enterprises to introduce cross-cutting changes within their activities. These changes are not limited to the ICT sector but affect other economic sectors. This is related to the role that the ICT sector plays in creating innovation, building modern business models and new phenomena in the information society. The aim of the article is an attempt to characterize the conditions related to the transformation of ICT companies caused by the COVID-19 epidemic. The first part of the article defines the basic concepts of the ICT sector and characterizes its importance for the development of the economy.

The proposed formula yields good qualitative agreement already when $rogeq3$ and rapidly becomes quantitatively accurate as larger values of $ro$ are assumed. The derivation is based on the method of matched asymptotic expansions, which exploits the fact that the exponential growing phase and the eventual recession of the outbreak occur on distinct time scales. From the newly derived solution, an analytical estimate of the time separating the first inflexion point of the epidemic curve from the peak of infections is given.","Kozyreff, G.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.24.21254226v1?rss=1,554
175650,Research on Cold Chain Transport of Vaccines in Major Outbreaks,2020,"Objective: Researchers have been investigating numerous biomarkers and scoring systems to predict the prognosis of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We aimed to determine the effectiveness of the quick sequential organ failure assessment (qSOFA) scoring system in pre-hospital emergency health care for predicting COVID-19 prognosis in terms of the intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality. Materials and Methods: We enrolled 9850 patients suspected to have COVID-19 who were transferred by 112 emergency medical services (EMS) between April 1, 2020 and July 1, 2020. Demographic and clinical data of the patients were obtained from the Ankara Emergency Health Services Automation System. The qSOFA score was calculated based on the data obtained from the ambulance medical records. Results: The 28-day mortality rate was 6.2% (n=13) and the cut-off for the qSOFA score was >1 [area under the curve (AUC)=0.955, sensitivity 84.62%, specificity 90.4%, p<0.001, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.918-0.979)]. The cut-off for ICU admission was a qSOFA score >1 (AUC=0.942;sensitivity 97.37%;specificity 84.97%;p<0.001;95% CI, 0.901-0.969). The mortality risk was 51.8 times more in patients with a high qSOFA score (p<0.001;95% CI, 10.682-251.340). Moreover, patients with a high qSOFA score were 47.7 times more likely to require ICU admission (p<0.001;95% CI, 16.735-136.039). Conclusion: Thus, the pre-hospital qSOFA score that comprises the ambulance vital signs of the patients can be used to predict ICU admissions and mortality in patients with COVID-19.

All people can benefit from education about how to have healthy friendships and dating relationships. But specific interventions on relationship skills-like respecting boundaries, identifying warning signs of abuse, or talking about sexual preferences-are too rare, particularly for autistic individuals. The goal of this study was to collect formative data from autistic emerging adults to help create a new, six-session workshop for autistic young adults to support healthy peer relationships. Twenty-five autistic youth aged 16-22 years old were interviewed.What this paper adds? The participants described a need for more and better information about how to support lasting friendships, deal with their anxiety about relationships, and know when friendships or dating relationships were reciprocal and rewarding versus unhealthy.Implications for practice, research, or policy. The results reveal a need for a new and effective intervention that supports healthy relationship skills for autistic people.","Rothman, Emily F; Graham Holmes, Laura",Autism,,554

In both COVID-19 cases, neurological physical examinations showed normal results before infection. Lymphocytopenia, accompanied by elevated cytokines and D-dimers, were found from serum clinical laboratory examination at admission. Dysarthria and limb muscle weakness are initial manifestations, occurring one week after infect-causative pathogen, SARS-CoV-2. The head CT and head/neck arterial CTA showed small-vessel occlusion. The patients were diagnosed with coronavirus diseases with secondary acute ischemic stroke. They were treated with tirofiban and followed up with daily aspirin and atorvastatin.

The models predict that massive testing allows to control the infection spread using a much lower isolation rate than in the case of indiscriminate quarantining.

This has in turn resulted in widespread efforts to identify suitable therapies to address this aggressive pathogen. Therapeutic antibody and vaccine development are being actively explored, and a phase I clinical trial of mRNA-1273 which is developed in collaboration between the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and Moderna, Inc. is currently underway. Timelines for the broad deployment of a vaccine and antibody therapies have been estimated to be 12-18 months or longer. These are promising approaches that may lead to sustained efficacy in treating COVID-19. However, its emergence has also led to a large number of clinical trials evaluating drug combinations composed of repurposed therapies. As study results of these combinations continue to be evaluated, there is a need to move beyond traditional drug screening and repurposing by harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) to optimize combination therapy design. This may lead to the rapid identification of regimens that mediate unexpected and markedly enhanced treatment outcomes.","Ho, Dean",Adv Intell Syst,,554

This puts them at higher risk of acquiring the infection than other individuals in the community. Defining immunity status among health care workers is therefore of interest since it helps to mitigate the exposure risk. This study was conducted between May 20th and 30th, 2020. Eighty-five hospitals across Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were divided into 2 groups: COVID-19 referral hospitals are those to which RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients were admitted or referred for management (Case-hospitals). COVID-19 nonaffected hospitals where no COVID-19 patients had been admitted or managed and no HCW outbreak (Control hospitals). Next, seroprevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 among HCWs was evaluated; there were 12,621 HCWs from the 85 hospitals. There were 61 case-hospitals with 9379 (74.3%) observations, and 24 control-hospitals with 3242 (25.7%) observations. The overall positivity rate by the immunoassay was 299 (2.36%) with a significant difference between the case-hospital (2.9%) and the control-group (0.8%) (P value <0.001). There was a wide variation in the positivity rate between regions and/or cities in Saudi Arabia, ranging from 0% to 6.31%. Of the serology positive samples, 100 samples were further tested using the SAS2pp neutralization assay; 92 (92%) samples showed neutralization activity.

342357,Corona in Pupuh Ginada Dasar: A cultural response to crisis situations due to the Coronavirus pandemic,2021,"BACKGROUND: Health care personnel (HCP) who demonstrated close contact with Corona virus disease (COVID-19) patients might experience a higher risk of infection and psychological problems. This study aims to explore depressive, anxiety, and burnout symptoms among HCP with a higher risk for psychological trauma. METHODS: This study was a cross-sectional study using secondary data from an online assessment, which was conducted 1 month after the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 544 respondents from 21 provinces in Indonesia were included. Data on depressive, anxiety, and burnout symptoms were transformed first using the Rasch model and then categorized. Data from HCP in the higher risk group and the lower risk group were analyzed. RESULTS: A higher percentage of HCP experiencing depressive symptoms (22.8%), anxiety (28.1%), and burnout (26.8%) are found in the higher risk group. The chance for the higher risk group's HCP to present with moderate and severe depressive symptoms, anxiety, and burnout are: 5.28 (Confidence interval (CI): 2.01-13.89; p < 0.05), 1.36 (CI: 0.09-1.96; p > 0.05), and 3.92 (CI: 2.08-7.40; p < 0.05) times higher, respectively. The probability for patient-induced burnout is 2.13 (CI: 1.51-3.007; p < 0.05) times higher and highest among the other burn out dimensions. The depressive symptoms complained were similar between groups: loneliness, sleep disturbances, difficulty concentrating, and inability to initiate activities. Loneliness demonstrates the highest logit value among the symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: HCP with direct contact and responsibility to treat COVID-19 patients exhibit a higher risk to experience depressive symptoms and burnout. Communication with peers and staying in contact with family needs to be encouraged. Psychological well-being should be considered for high-risk HCP. Incentive or insurance guaranteed by the government or institution is essential as a reward and compensation during this period.","Sunjaya, Deni Kurniadi; Herawati, Dewi Marhaeni Diah; Siregar, Adiatma Y M",BMC Public Health,,554

The COVID-19 International Student Well-being Study (C19 ISWS) is a cross-sectional multicountry study that collected data on higher-education students during the COVID-19 outbreak in the spring of 2020. The dataset allows description of: (1) living conditions, financial conditions, and academic workload before and during the COVID-19 outbreak; (2) the current level of mental well-being and effects on healthy lifestyles; (3) perceived stressors; (4) resources (e.g., social support and economic capital); (5) knowledge related to COVID-19; and (6) attitudes toward COVID-19 measures implemented by the government and relevant HEI. The dataset additionally includes information about COVID-19 measures taken by the government and HEI that were in place during the period of data collection. The collected data provide a comprehensive and comparative dataset on student well-being. In this article, we present the rationale for this study, the development and content of the survey, the methodology of data collection and sampling, and the limitations of the study. In addition, we highlight the opportunities that the dataset provides for advancing social science research on student well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic in varying policy contexts. Thus far, this is, to our knowledge, the first cross-country student well-being survey during the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in a unique dataset that enables high-priority socially relevant research.","Van de Velde, Sarah; Buffel, Veerle; Bracke, Piet; Van Hal, Guido; Somogyi, Nikolett M; Willems, Barbara; Wouters, Edwin",Scand J Public Health,,554

COVID-19 resembles community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Our aim was to identify lymphocyte subpopulations to distinguish between COVID-19 and CAP. Methods: We compared the peripheral blood lymphocytes and their subsets in 296 patients with COVID-19 and 130 patients with CAP. Parameters for independent prediction of COVID-19 were calculated by logistic regression. Results: The main lymphocyte subpopulations (CD3+CD4+, CD16+CD56+, and CD4+/CD8+ ratio) and cytokines (TNF-&#945; and IFN-Î³) of COVID-19 patients were significantly different from that of CAP patients. CD16+CD56+%, CD4+/CD8+ratio, CD19+, and CD3+CD4+ were identified as predictors of COVID-19 diagnosis by logistic regression. In addition, the CD3+CD4+counts, CD3+CD8+ counts, andTNF-&#945; are independent predictors of disease severity in patients. Conclusions: Lymphopenia is an important part of SARS-CoV-2 infection, and lymphocyte subsets and cytokines may be useful to predict the severity and clinical outcomes of the disease.","Liu, Guohong; Jiang, Xianghu; Zeng, Xiaojiao; Pan, Yunbao; Xu, Haibo",J Immunol Res,,554

The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between mask wearing practice and the risk of anxiety during the COVID-19 epidemic among teachers in Henan province, China. METHODS: We enrolled 88,611 teachers in an online cross-sectional survey across three cities of Henan Province in China. A total of 94.75% of study participants completed an online questionnaire between February 4, 2020 and February 12, 2020. Mask wearing practice was defined according to its type, how it is worn, and the behavior exhibited in relation to wearing a mask. We used the Generalized Anxiety Disorder tool (GAD-7) to assess anxiety levels among study participants. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to estimate the association between mask wearing practice and anxiety by using multivariable logistic regression models. RESULTS: A total of 67,357 registered teachers (25.91% men) were included in this study. After adjusting for potential confounders, participants who knew the wrong type of mask had 17% increased odds of having anxiety compared to those who knew the proper type (Aor = 1.17; 95%CI: 1.11-1.24). Odds for anxiety were higher for teachers who did not know the proper way of wearing mask compared to those who knew it properly (aOR = 1.18; 95%CI: 1.07-1.30). Not adhering to proper behavior of mask wearing was associated with 39% increased odds for anxiety (aOR = 1.39; 95%CI: 1.18-1.64). The odds for anxiety for teachers who did not adhere to all the three parameters of proper mask wearing was about 2.55 times as much compared to those who reported full compliance to the parameters (aOR = 2.55; 95%CI: 1.22-5.35). We observed similar ORs on stratified analyses across gender and age groups. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that improper mask wearing is another important attribute that play a significant role in increasing the risk of anxiety during the COVID-19 epidemic situation. However, these results should be considered as exploratory and hence interpreted with caution.","Li, Quanman; Tarimo, Clifford Silver; Miao, Yudong; Zeng, Xin; Wu, Cuiping; Wu, Jian",J. affect. disord,,554

It has been reported that those who suffer from cancer (especially lung cancer and hematological malignancies) are at higher risk of serious complications and death from COVID-19. Some cancer treatments such as CAR T cell therapy can produce a cytokine storm, which is also a hallmark of severe COVID-19. Therefore, patients receiving CAR T cells are at higher risk if they become infected with COVID-19, and could be treated with anti-cytokine approaches.","Razavi, AzadehSadat; Hamblin, Michael R; Rezaei, Nima",Am. j. emerg. med,,554

However, FYM&S may contain high concentrations of pathogens, and complete inactivation through the AD process is unlikely. Thus, following land application of digestate, pathogens may contaminate a range of environmental media posing a potential threat to public health. The present study aimed to combine primary laboratory data with literature-based secondary data to develop an Excel-based exposure assessment model (ADRISK) using a gamma generalised linear model to predict the final microorganism count in the digestate. This research examines the behaviour of a suite of pathogens (Cryptosporidium parvum, norovirus, Mycobacterium spp., Salmonella spp., Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium spp., and pathogenic Escherichia coli) and indicators (total coliforms, E. coli, and enterococci) during mesophilic anaerobic digestion (M-AD) at 37 °C, pre/post-AD pasteurisation, and after a period of storage (with/without lime) for different feedstock proportions (slurry:food waste: 0:1, 1:3, 2:1, and 3:1). ADRISK tool simulations of faecal indicator bacteria levels across all scenarios show that the digestate can meet the EU standard without pasteurisation if the AD runs at 37 °C or a higher temperature with a higher C:N ratio (recipe 3) and a hydraulic retention time &#8805; 7 days. The storage of digestate also reduced levels of microorganisms in the digestate. The Irish pasteurisation process (60 °C for 4 days), although more energy-intensive, is more effective than the EU pasteurisation (70 °C for 1 h) specification. Pre-AD pasteurisation was more effective for C. parvum, norovirus, Mycobacterium thermoresistibile. However, post-AD literature-based pasteurisation is most likely to assure the safety of the digestate. The information generated from this model can inform policy-makers regarding the optimal M-AD process parameters necessary to maximise the inactivation of microorganisms, ensuring adverse environmental impact is minimised, and public health is protected.","Nag, Rajat; Auer, Agathe; Nolan, Stephen; Russell, Lauren; Markey, Bryan K; Whyte, Paul; O039,; Flaherty, Vincent; Bolton, Declan; Fenton, Owen; Richards, Karl G; Cummins, Enda",Sci Total Environ,,554

This study aimed to design a novel vaccine construct against SARS-CoV-2 from the spike S protein and orf1ab polyprotein using immunoinformatics tools. The vaccine was designed from conserved epitopes interacted against B and T lymphocytes by the combination of highly immunogenic epitopes with suitable adjuvant and linkers. RESULTS: The proposed vaccine composed of 526 amino acids and was shown to be antigenic in Vaxigen server (0.6194) and nonallergenic in Allertop server. The physiochemical properties of the vaccine showed isoelectric point of 10.19. The instability index (II) was 31.25 classifying the vaccine as stable. Aliphatic index was 84.39 and the grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) was - 0.049 classifying the vaccine as hydrophilic. Vaccine tertiary structure was predicted, refined and validated to assess the stability of the vaccine via Ramachandran plot and ProSA-web servers. Moreover, solubility of the vaccine construct was greater than the average solubility provided by protein sol and SOLpro servers indicating the solubility of the vaccine construct. Disulfide engineering was performed to reduce the high mobile regions in the vaccine to enhance stability. Docking of the vaccine construct with TLR4 demonstrated efficient binding energy with attractive binding energy of - 338.68 kcal/mol and - 346.89 kcal/mol for TLR4 chain A and chain B respectively. Immune simulation significantly provided high levels of immunoglobulins, T-helper cells, T-cytotoxic cells and INF-Î³. Upon cloning, the vaccine protein was reverse transcribed into DNA sequence and cloned into pET28a(+) vector to ensure translational potency and microbial expression. CONCLUSION: A unique vaccine construct from spike S protein and orf1ab polyprotein against B and T lymphocytes was generated with potential protection against the pandemic. The present study might assist in developing a suitable therapeutics protocol to combat SARSCoV-2 infection.","Almofti, Yassir A; Abd-Elrahman, Khoubieb Ali; Eltilib, Elsideeq E M",BMC Immunol,,554

The physiochemical properties of the vaccine showed isoelectric point of 10.19. The instability index (II) was 31.25 classifying the vaccine as stable. Aliphatic index was 84.39 and the grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) was - 0.049 classifying the vaccine as hydrophilic. Vaccine tertiary structure was predicted, refined and validated to assess the stability of the vaccine via Ramachandran plot and ProSA-web servers. Moreover, solubility of the vaccine construct was greater than the average solubility provided by protein sol and SOLpro servers indicating the solubility of the vaccine construct. Disulfide engineering was performed to reduce the high mobile regions in the vaccine to enhance stability. Docking of the vaccine construct with TLR4 demonstrated efficient binding energy with attractive binding energy of - 338.68 kcal/mol and - 346.89 kcal/mol for TLR4 chain A and chain B respectively. Immune simulation significantly provided high levels of immunoglobulins, T-helper cells, T-cytotoxic cells and INF-Î³. Upon cloning, the vaccine protein was reverse transcribed into DNA sequence and cloned into pET28a(+) vector to ensure translational potency and microbial expression. CONCLUSION: A unique vaccine construct from spike S protein and orf1ab polyprotein against B and T lymphocytes was generated with potential protection against the pandemic. The present study might assist in developing a suitable therapeutics protocol to combat SARSCoV-2 infection.","Almofti, Yassir A; Abd-Elrahman, Khoubieb Ali; Eltilib, Elsideeq E M",BMC Immunol,,554

In the current pandemic phase, all patients should be considered as potentially infected. Thus, the level of precaution recommended for the caregivers depends more on the type of procedure than on the patient's proved or suspected COVID-19 status. Procedures that are particularly at high risk of contamination are clinical and flexible endoscopic pharyngo-laryngological evaluation, and probably also video fluoroscopic swallowing exams. Voice rehabilitation should not be considered urgent at this time. Therefore, recommendations presented here mainly concern the management of swallowing disorders, which can sometimes be dangerous for the patient, and recent dysphonia. In cases where they are considered possible and useful, teleconsultations should be preferred to face-to-face assessments or rehabilitation sessions. The latter must be maintained only in few selected situations, after team discussions or in accordance with the guidelines provided by health authorities.","Mattei, A; Amy de la Bretèque, B; Crestani, S; Crevier-Buchman, L; Galant, C; Hans, S; Julien-Laferrière, A; Lagier, A; Lobryeau, C; Marmouset, F; Robert, D; Woisard, V; Giovanni, A",Eur Ann Otorhinolaryngol Head Neck Dis,,554

We performed a systematic review and metanalysis aimed to evaluate the pooled incidence of acute HF as a cardiac complication of COVID-19 disease and to estimate the related mortality risk in these patients. METHODS: Data were obtained searching MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science for all investigations published any time to 26 December 2020. If statistical heterogeneity was 50%, the results were derived from the fixed-effects model otherwise the random-effects model. RESULTS: Overall, 1064 patients [mean age 66 years, 618 males] were included in the final analysis reviewing six investigations. The cumulative in-hospital rate of COVID-19 patients complicated by acute HF ranged between 6.9 and 63.4% among the studies reviewed. A random effect model revealed a pooled incidence of COVID-19 patients complicated by acute HF in 20.2% of cases (95% CI: 11.1-33.9%, p < 0.0001 I2 = 94.4%). A second pooled analysis, based on a random-effect model, confirmed a significant increased risk of death in COVID-19 patients complicated by acute HF during the infection (OR 9.36, 95% CI 4.76-18.4, p < 0.0001, I2 = 56.6%). Meta-regression analysis, using age as moderator variable, failed in founding a statistically significant relationship with the incidence of acute HF onset as a complication of COVID-19 disease (p = 0.062) or the mortality risk among the same subjects (p = 0.053). CONCLUSIONS: Acute HF represents a frequent complication of COVID-19 infection associated with a higher risk of mortality in the short-term period.","Zuin, Marco; Rigatelli, Gianluca; Bilato, Claudio; Zuliani, Giovanni; Roncon, Loris",Acta Cardiol,,554

To estimate the impact of the timing and intensity of such measures, we built a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission that incorporates age-stratified risks and contact patterns and projects numbers of hospitalizations, patients in intensive care units, ventilator needs, and deaths within US cities. Focusing on the Austin metropolitan area of Texas, we found that immediate and extensive social distancing measures were required to ensure that COVID-19 cases did not exceed local hospital capacity by early May 2020. School closures alone hardly changed the epidemic curve. A 2-week delay in implementation was projected to accelerate the timing of peak healthcare needs by 4 weeks and cause a bed shortage in intensive care units.

In this work, we explore the concept of self-attention for tackling such subtleties in and between diseases. To this end, we introduce MEDUSA, a multi-scale encoder-decoder self-attention mechanism tailored for medical image analysis. While self-attention deep convolutional neural network architectures in existing literature center around the notion of multiple isolated lightweight attention mechanisms with limited individual capacities being incorporated at different points in the network architecture, MEDUSA takes a significant departure from this notion by possessing a single, unified self-attention mechanism with significantly higher capacity with multiple attention heads feeding into different scales in the network architecture. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first""single body, multi-scale heads""realization of self-attention and enables explicit global context amongst selective attention at different levels of representational abstractions while still enabling differing local attention context at individual levels of abstractions. With MEDUSA, we obtain state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging medical image analysis benchmarks including COVIDx, RSNA RICORD, and RSNA Pneumonia Challenge when compared to previous work.

We introduce a class of group testing protocols with small dilution, suited to operate even at high prevalence ($5\%-10\%$), and maximizing the fraction of samples classified positive/negative within the first round of tests. Precisely, if the tested group has exactly one positive sample then the protocols identify it without further individual tests. The protocols also detect the presence of two or more positives in the group, in which case a second round could be applied to identify the positive individuals. With a prevalence of $5\%$ and maximum dilution 6, with 100 tests we classify 242 individuals, $92\%$ of them in one round and $8\%$ requiring a second individual test.

METHODS: Reports to the FAERS from 1 January 2004 to 8 March 2020 were analyzed. The proportion of report ratio (PRR), reporting odds ratio (ROR), and Bayesian confidence interval progressive neural network (BCPNN) method were used to detect the safety signals. RESULTS: A total of 55 safety signals were detected from the top 250 adverse event reactions in 2200 reports, but 19 signals were not included in the drug labels. All the detected adverse event reactions were associated with 13 System Organ Classes (SOC), such as gastrointestinal, blood and lymph, hepatobiliary, endocrine, and various nervous systems. The most frequent adverse events were analyzed, and the results showed that females were more likely to suffer from anemia, vomiting, neutropenia, diarrhea, and insomnia. CONCLUSION: The ADE (adverse drug event) signal detection based on FAERS is helpful to clarify the potential adverse events related to ribavirin-interferon combination for novel coronavirus therapy; clinicians should pay attention to the adverse reactions of gastrointestinal and blood systems, closely monitor the fluctuations of the platelet count, and carry out necessary mental health interventions to avoid serious adverse events.","Shan, Wenya; Hong, Dongsheng; Zhu, Jieqiang; Zhao, Qingwei",Comput Math Methods Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33029193/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/1391583,554
594702,The Role of von Willebrand Factor in Microvascular Surgery in Severely Injured Patients,2021-10-04,"Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an economically important pathogen that has evolved several mechanisms to evade type I IFN responses. Type III interferon (IFN-λ), an innate cytokine that primarily targets the mucosal epithelia, is critical in fighting mucosal infection in the host and has been reported to potently inhibit PEDV infection in vitro. However, how PEDV escapes IFN-λ antiviral response remains unclear. In this study, we found that PEDV infection induced significant IFN-λ expression in type I IFN-defective Vero E6 cells, but virus-induced endogenous IFN-λ did not reduce PEDV titers. Moreover, we demonstrated that PEDV escaped IFN-λ responses by substantially upregulating the suppressor of cytokine signaling protein 1 (SOCS1) expression, which impaired the induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and dampened the IFN-λ antiviral response and facilitated PEDV replication in Vero E6 cells. We further showed that PEDV infection increased SOCS1 expression by decreasing host miR-30c-5p expression. MiR-30c-5p suppressed SOCS1 expression through targeting the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of SOCS1. The inhibition of IFN-λ elicited ISGs expression by SOCS1 was specifically rescued by overexpression of miR-30c-5p. Collectively, our findings identify a new strategy by PEDV to escape IFN-λ-mediated antiviral immune responses by engaging the SOCS1/miR-30c axis, thus improving our understanding of its pathogenesis.","Wang, Changlin; Shan, Lingling; Qu, Shuxin; Xue, Mei; Wang, Keliang; Fu, Fang; Wang, Lu; Wang, Ziqi; Feng, Li; Xu, Wanhai; Liu, Pinghuang",Front Microbiol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2020.01180; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32574254/,554

607893,Mitteilungen des GRC,2020-06-10,"BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission substantially affected health services worldwide. To better understand the impact of the pandemic on childhood routine immunisation, we estimated disruptions in vaccine coverage associated with the pandemic in 2020, globally and by Global Burden of Disease (GBD) super-region. METHODS: For this analysis we used a two-step hierarchical random spline modelling approach to estimate global and regional disruptions to routine immunisation using administrative data and reports from electronic immunisation systems, with mobility data as a model input. Paired with estimates of vaccine coverage expected in the absence of COVID-19, which were derived from vaccine coverage models from GBD 2020, Release 1 (GBD 2020 R1), we estimated the number of children who missed routinely delivered doses of the third-dose diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP3) vaccine and first-dose measles-containing vaccine (MCV1) in 2020. FINDINGS: Globally, in 2020, estimated vaccine coverage was 76·7% (95% uncertainty interval 74·3–78·6) for DTP3 and 78·9% (74·8–81·9) for MCV1, representing relative reductions of 7·7% (6·0–10·1) for DTP3 and 7·9% (5·2–11·7) for MCV1, compared to expected doses delivered in the absence of the COVID-19 pandemic. From January to December, 2020, we estimated that 30·0 million (27·6–33·1) children missed doses of DTP3 and 27·2 million (23·4–32·5) children missed MCV1 doses. Compared to expected gaps in coverage for eligible children in 2020, these estimates represented an additional 8·5 million (6·5–11·6) children not routinely vaccinated with DTP3 and an additional 8·9 million (5·7–13·7) children not routinely vaccinated with MCV1 attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. Globally, monthly disruptions were highest in April, 2020, across all GBD super-regions, with 4·6 million (4·0–5·4) children missing doses of DTP3 and 4·4 million (3·7–5·2) children missing doses of MCV1. Every GBD super-region saw reductions in vaccine coverage in March and April, with the most severe annual impacts in north Africa and the Middle East, south Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean. We estimated the lowest annual reductions in vaccine delivery in sub-Saharan Africa, where disruptions remained minimal throughout the year. For some super-regions, including southeast Asia, east Asia, and Oceania for both DTP3 and MCV1, the high-income super-region for DTP3, and south Asia for MCV1, estimates suggest that monthly doses were delivered at or above expected levels during the second half of 2020. INTERPRETATION: Routine immunisation services faced stark challenges in 2020, with the COVID-19 pandemic causing the most widespread and largest global disruption in recent history. Although the latest coverage trajectories point towards recovery in some regions, a combination of lagging catch-up immunisation services, continued SARS-CoV-2 transmission, and persistent gaps in vaccine coverage before the pandemic still left millions of children under-vaccinated or unvaccinated against preventable diseases at the end of 2020, and these gaps are likely to extend throughout 2021. Strengthening routine immunisation data systems and efforts to target resources and outreach will be essential to minimise the risk of vaccine-preventable disease outbreaks, reach children who missed routine vaccine doses during the pandemic, and accelerate progress towards higher and more equitable vaccination coverage over the next decade.

615757,Bewiesen: COVID-19 ≠ Influenza,2021-02-04,"The pandemic of COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) has led to more than 117 million reported cases and 2.6 million deaths. Accurate diagnosis technologies are vital for controlling this pandemic. Reverse transcription (RT)-based nucleic acid detection assays have been developed, but the strict sample processing requirement of RT has posed obstacles on wider applications. This study established a ligation and recombinase polymerase amplification (L/RPA) combined assay for rapid detection of SARS-CoV−2 on genes N and ORF1ab targeting the specific biomarkers recommended by the China CDC. Ligase-based strategies usually have a low-efficiency problem on RNA templates. This study has addressed this problem by using a high concentration of the T4 DNA ligase and exploiting the high sensitivity of RPA. Through selection of the ligation probes and optimization of the RPA primers, the assay achieved a satisfactory sensitivity of 10(1) viral RNA copies per reaction, which was comparable to RT-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and other nucleic acid detection assays for SARS-CoV−2. The assay could be finished in less than 30 min with a simple procedure, in which the requirement for sophisticated thermocycling equipment had been avoided. In addition, it avoided the RT procedure and could potentially ease the requirement for sample processing. Once validated with clinical samples, the L/RPA assay would increase the practical testing availability of SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, the principle of L/RPA has an application potential to the identification of concerned mutations of the virus.","Wang, Pei; Ma, Chao; Zhang, Xue; Chen, Lizhan; Yi, Longyu; Liu, Xin; Lu, Qunwei; Cao, Yang; Gao, Song",Front Cell Infect Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34123877/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fcimb.2021.680728,554
621294,Severe A-line infections in COVID-19 patients: A novel management algorithm in an emergency setting,2020-12-26,"Background: Coronaviruses (CoV) are a large family of viruses that are common in people and many animal species. Animal coronaviruses rarely infect humans with the exceptions of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV), the Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and now SARS-CoV-2, which is the cause of the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Many studies suggested that genetic variants in ACE2 gene may influence the host susceptibility/resistance to SARS-CoV-2 virus according to the functional role of ACE2 in human pathophysiology. However, all these studies have been conducted in silico based on epidemiological and population data. We therefore investigated the occurrence of ACE2 variants in a cohort of 99 Italian unrelated individuals clinically diagnosed with coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) to experimental demonstrate allelic association with disease severity. Methods: By whole-exome sequencing we analysed 99 DNA samples of severely and extremely severely COVID-19 patients hospitalized at the University Hospital of Rome Tor Vergata and Bambino Gesu Hospital in Rome. Results: We identified three different germline variants, one intronic (c.439+4G>A) and two missense (c.2158A>G, p.Asn720Asp; c.1888G>C, p.Asp630His ), in 26 patients with a similar frequency between male and female and a not statistically different frequency, except for c.1888G>C, (p.Asp630His) with the ethnically matched populations (EUR). Conclusions: Our results suggest that there is not any ACE2 exonic allelic association with disease severity. It is possible that rare susceptibility alleles are located in the non-coding region of the gene able to control ACE2 gene activity. It is therefore of interest, to explore the existence of ACE2 susceptibility alleles to SARS-Co-V2 in these regulatory regions. In addition, we found no significant evidence that ACE2 alleles is associated with disease severity/sex bias in the Italian population.","Novelli, A.; Biancolella, M.; Borgiani, P.; Cocciadiferro, D.; Colona, V.

No, or not yet, is the qualified answer based on the evidence available. Although more than 200 viruses - some of them deadly zoonotic viruses - have been isolated from or otherwise detected in bats, the supposed connections between bats, bat viruses and human diseases have been raised more on speculation than on evidence supporting their direct or indirect roles in the epidemiology of diseases (except for rabies). However, we are convinced that the evidence points in that direction and that at some point it will be proved that bats are competent hosts for at least a few zoonotic viruses. In this review, we cover aspects of bat biology, ecology and evolution that might be relevant in medical investigations and we provide a historical synthesis of some disease outbreaks causally linked to bats. We provide evolutionary-based hypotheses to tentatively explain the viral transmission route through mammalian intermediate hosts and to explain the geographic concentration of most outbreaks, but both are no more than speculations that still require formal assessment.","Moratelli, Ricardo; Calisher, Charles H",Mem Inst Oswaldo Cruz,https://doi.org/10.1590/0074-02760150048; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25742261/,554

From very significant preclinical research performed at Virginia Commonwealth University with vitamin C and with the very positive results of a previously performed phase I safety trial infusing high dose vitamin C intravenously into patients with severe sepsis, we reasoned that infusing identical dosing to a patient with ARDS from viral infection would be therapeutic. We report here the case of a 20-year-old, previously healthy, female who contracted respiratory enterovirus/rhinovirus infection that led to acute lung injury and rapidly to ARDS. She contracted the infection in central Italy while on an 8-d spring break from college. During a return flight to the United States, she developed increasing dyspnea and hypoxemia that rapidly developed into acute lung injury that led to ARDS. When support with mechanical ventilation failed, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was initiated. Twelve hours following ECMO initiation, high dose intravenous vitamin C was begun. The patient’s recovery was rapid. ECMO and mechanical ventilation were discontinued by day-7 and the patient recovered with no long-term ARDS sequelae. Infusing high dose intravenous vitamin C into this patient with virus-induced ARDS was associated with rapid resolution of lung injury with no evidence of post-ARDS fibroproliferative sequelae. Intravenous vitamin C as a treatment for ARDS may open a new era of therapy for ARDS from many causes.","Fowler III, Alpha A; Kim, Christin; Lepler, Lawrence; Malhotra, Rajiv; Debesa, Orlando; Natarajan, Ramesh; Fisher, Bernard J; Syed, Aamer; DeWilde, Christine; Priday, Anna; Kasirajan, Vigneshwar",World J Crit Care Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28224112/; https://doi.org/10.5492/wjccm.v6.i1.85,554
644602,Feline coronavirus: Insights into viral pathogenesis based on the spike protein structure and function,2018-01-10,"In the process of developing new conservation policies, policymakers must have access to information which will inform their decisions. Evidence rarely considers the complexities of social-ecological systems. The Social-Ecological Systems Framework (SESF) is an adaptable yet structured approach for understanding the processes that lead to changes in natural resources, using a systems-based approach that aims to treat ecological and social components equally. Few conservation planning and policy initiatives have implemented the SESF to assess the interlinked social and ecological consequences of conservation policies. We apply the SESF to explore the barriers to the potential implementation of a policy of consumptive utilisation of wildlife in Kenya, a policy regarded as successful in several southern African countries. Using secondary data and expert review we developed a conceptual model of the social-ecological system associated with consumptive utilisation of wildlife in Kenya. We then analysed how different combinations of first and second-tier variables interacted to create focal action situations, and subsequently identified seven barriers to this policy. Our analysis revealed that game ranching would require large-scale investment in effective monitoring systems, new regulations, training, market development and research, considerations about equity, and devolved ownership of wildlife. The least barriers existed for game farming. The SESF appears to be a useful framework for this purpose. In particular, it can help to reveal potential social and ecological barriers which conservation policies might face in attempting to meet intended goals. The information required to implement the SESF are necessarily cross-disciplinary, which can make it challenging to synthesise.","Brehony, Peadar; Tyrrell, Peter; Kamanga, John; Waruingi, Lucy; Kaelo, Dickson",Biol Conserv,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320720307552; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32834059/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0006320720307552; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2020.108697,554

647917,Running a safe and effective Cleft Network Service in response to the COVID-19 Pandemic,2021-06-06,"BACKGROUND: In the era of information overload, are big data analytics the answer to access and better manage available knowledge? Over the last decade, the use of Web-based data in public health issues, that is, infodemiology, has been proven useful in assessing various aspects of human behavior. Google Trends is the most popular tool to gather such information, and it has been used in several topics up to this point, with health and medicine being the most focused subject. Web-based behavior is monitored and analyzed in order to examine actual human behavior so as to predict, better assess, and even prevent health-related issues that constantly arise in everyday life. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review aimed at reporting and further presenting and analyzing the methods, tools, and statistical approaches for Google Trends (infodemiology) studies in health-related topics from 2006 to 2016 to provide an overview of the usefulness of said tool and be a point of reference for future research on the subject. METHODS: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines for selecting studies, we searched for the term “Google Trends” in the Scopus and PubMed databases from 2006 to 2016, applying specific criteria for types of publications and topics. A total of 109 published papers were extracted, excluding duplicates and those that did not fall inside the topics of health and medicine or the selected article types. We then further categorized the published papers according to their methodological approach, namely, visualization, seasonality, correlations, forecasting, and modeling. RESULTS: All the examined papers comprised, by definition, time series analysis, and all but two included data visualization. A total of 23.1% (24/104) studies used Google Trends data for examining seasonality, while 39.4% (41/104) and 32.7% (34/104) of the studies used correlations and modeling, respectively. Only 8.7% (9/104) of the studies used Google Trends data for predictions and forecasting in health-related topics; therefore, it is evident that a gap exists in forecasting using Google Trends data. CONCLUSIONS: The monitoring of online queries can provide insight into human behavior, as this field is significantly and continuously growing and will be proven more than valuable in the future for assessing behavioral changes and providing ground for research using data that could not have been accessed otherwise.","Mavragani, Amaryllis; Ochoa, Gabriela; Tsagarakis, Konstantinos P",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30401664/; https://doi.org/10.2196/jmir.9366,554

Suite au confinement, une surveillance renforcée est mise en place en raison du risque d’augmentation des surdosages : changement d’organisation des CSAPA ; mise en place de mesures dérogatoires pour la dispensation [1] ; contexte anxiogène ; faible diffusion de naloxone. L’objectif est de suivre la survenue de surdosages depuis janvier 2020 par rapport à 2019. MÉTHODES: Parmi les cas graves méthadone saisis dans la BNPV durant les 1(ers) semestres 2019 et 2020, ceux en lien avec un surdosage (signes cliniques, décès) sont retenus. RÉSULTATS: Parmi les 410 cas graves saisis, 280 sont des surdosages dont 133 sont survenus durant le 1(er) semestre (59 en 2019 et 74 en 2020). Si on tient compte des cas survenus ET notifiés la même année, on observe davantage de surdosages en 2020 (Fig. 1) : 2,2 fois plus de cas par rapport à 2019 et 3 fois plus de décès (21 versus 7). En 2020, le nombre de cas est plus important depuis le confinement (alors qu’il existe un temps de décalage entre la date de survenue et de déclaration). Les surdosages se caractérisent par : un usage dans le cadre d’un protocole ou hors prescription chez des sujets naïfs/consommateurs occasionnels ; une accessibilité via l’entourage direct ; des contextes de consommation variés (défonce, à visée anxiolytique ou sédative, geste impulsif suite à un conflit, antalgique, festif, autolyse…) ; des consommations associées à d’autres dépresseurs respiratoires et cocaïne ; la faible mention d’utilisation de « take home » naloxone. DISCUSSION: L’ensemble de ces données met en avant : une augmentation des indicateurs de morbi-mortalité en parallèle à l’augmentation de l’accessibilité de la méthadone (tendance exacerbée durant le confinement) et une méconnaissance de sa puissance pharmacologique et des risques par les sujets exposés (et l’entourage).

Although only a few are life threatening, they have substantial implications for human health and the economy, as exemplified by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Viruses are rather small infectious agents found in all types of life forms, from animals and plants to prokaryotes and archaebacteria. They are obligate intracellular parasites, and as such, subvert many molecular and cellular processes of the host cell to ensure their own replication, amplification, and subsequent spread. This special issue addresses the cell biology of viral infections based on a collection of original research articles, communications, opinions, and reviews on various aspects of virus-host cell interactions. Together, these articles not only provide a glance into the latest research on the cell biology of viral infections, but also include novel technological developments.","Lozach, Pierre-Yves",Cells,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33171736/; https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9112431,554
657064,Percutaneous needle fasciotomy for Dupuytren's disease: a one-stop approach incidentally suited to the era of COVID-19,2020-08-29,"The Guangdong government implemented lockdown measures on January 23, 2020, to ease the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). These measures prohibit a series of human activities and lead to a great reduction in anthropogenic emissions. Starting on February 20, all companies resumed work and production, and emissions gradually recovered. To investigate the response of air pollutants in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) to the emission reduction and recovery related to COVID-19 lockdown, we used the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to estimate the changes in air pollutants, including three periods: Period I (January 10 to January 22, 2020), Period II (January 23 to February 19, 2020), Period III (February 20 to March 9, 2020). During Period II, under the concurrent influence of emissions and meteorology, air quality improved significantly with PM2.5, NO2, and SO2 decreased by 52%, 67%, and 25%, respectively. O3 had no obvious changes in most cities, which mainly due to the synergetic effects of emissions and meteorology. In Period III, with the recovery of emissions and the changes in meteorology, the increase of secondary components was faster than that of primary PM2.5 (PPM), which indicated that changes in PPM concentration were more sensitive to emissions reduction. O3 concentration increased as emission and temperature rising. Our findings elucidate that more effective emission control strategies should be implemented in PRD to alleviate the increasingly serious pollution situation.","Wang, Siyu; Zhang, Yanli; Ma, Jinlong; Zhu, Shengqiang; Shen, Juanyong; Wang, Peng; Zhang, Hongliang",Sci Total Environ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33302072/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.143868; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S004896972037399X?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S004896972037399X,554
657285,HIV-Patient erkrankt an COVID-19,2021-06-24,"BACKGROUND: Living in the time of the COVID-19 means experiencing not only a global health emergency but also extreme psychological stress with potential emotional side effects such as sadness, grief, irritability, and mood swings. Crucially, lockdown and confinement measures isolate people who become the first and the only ones in charge of their own mental health: people are left alone facing a novel and potentially lethal situation, and, at the same time, they need to develop adaptive strategies to face it, at home. In this view, easy-to-use, inexpensive, and scientifically validated self-help solutions aiming to reduce the psychological burden of coronavirus are extremely necessary. AIMS: This pragmatic trial aims to provide the evidence that a weekly self-help virtual reality (VR) protocol can help overcome the psychological burden of the Coronavirus by relieving anxiety, improving well-being, and reinforcing social connectedness. The protocol will be based on the “Secret Garden” 360 VR video online (www.covidfeelgood.com) which simulates a natural environment aiming to promote relaxation and self-reflection. Three hundred sixty–degree or spherical videos allow the user to control the viewing direction. In this way, the user can explore the content from any angle like a panorama and experience presence and immersion. The “Secret Garden” video is combined with daily exercises that are designed to be experienced with another person (not necessarily physically together), to facilitate a process of critical examination and eventual revision of core assumptions and beliefs related to personal identity, relationships, and goals. METHODS: This is a multicentric, pragmatic pilot randomized controlled trial involving individuals who experienced the COVID-19 pandemic and underwent a lockdown and quarantine procedures. The trial is approved by the Ethics Committee of the Istituto Auxologico Italiano. Each research group in all the countries joining the pragmatic trial, aims at enrolling at least 30 individuals in the experimental group experiencing the self-help protocol, and 30 in the control group, over a period of 3 months to verify the feasibility of the intervention. CONCLUSION: The goal of this protocol is for VR to become the “surgical mask” of mental health treatment. Although surgical masks do not provide the wearer with a reliable level of protection against the coronavirus compared with FFP2 or FFP3 masks, surgical masks are very effective in protecting others from the wearer’s respiratory emissions. The goal of the VR protocol is the same: not necessarily to solve complex mental health problems but rather to improve well-being and preserve social connectedness through the beneficial social effects generated by positive emotions.","Riva, Giuseppe; Bernardelli, Luca; Browning, Matthew H.

We established sensitive methods of REV detection, including reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for REV-LTR and REV-gag genes, REV antigenemia measurements by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and virus isolation in tissue cultures. A variety of blood-sucking species of insects were trapped at farms with infected poultry and tested, but none were positive. To rule out the possibility of PCR inhibition by insect RNA, spiking experiments were conducted and no interference was observed. Because Cx. pipiens mosquitoes were trapped frequently at farms, we performed feeding experiments with mosquito females fed on a REV-containing tissue culture medium and chicken blood mixture. Virus was detected in the mosquitoes up to 5 h postfeeding, compared with 96 h in the feeding mixture, indicating that Cx. pipiens can only harbor REV for a short period. House flies were suspected to be involved in the virus transmission because they frequently were trapped on positive farms. In contrast to mosquitoes, REV was harbored within the house fly digestive tract for up to 72 h and could infect chickens, as demonstrated by seroconversion and by detection of viral gag-sequence in the cloaca. The current study is supportive for the role of house flies as a mechanical vector of REV among poultry.","Davidson, Irit; Braverman, Yehuda",J Med Entomol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15799521/,554

In this study, the main results include a new system model of TERP and some new findings on the system dynamic characteristics. The new model integrates finite difference method and state-space matrix, which is an integration of great simulation accuracy, high speed, and easy implementation. The thermal response time (TRT) and its asynchronism are confirmed and a new concept of AM (Asynchronism Magnitude) is defined to measure the degree of TRT asynchronism. Some new observations are obtained: (1) Under a certain environment, AM becomes a constant even when different step changes of current are imposed; (2) The TRT asynchronism disappeared at the second stage when environmental condition is step changed. Three new definitions of TRT are proposed and compared. Finally, in order to realize the fast and accurate prediction of TRT for the use of system on-line control or fast evaluation under dynamic state, an artificial neural network-based model is proved to be effective.

684546,Plastic Surgeons Nationwide Share Experience Regarding Telemedicine in Initial Patient Screening and Routine Postoperative Visits,2021-07-13,"Inflammation refers to the response of the immune system to viral, bacterial, and fungal infections, or other foreign particles in the body, which can involve the production of a wide array of soluble inflammatory mediators. It is important for the development of many RNA virus-infected diseases. The primary factors through which the infection becomes inflammation involve inflammasome. Inflammasomes are proteins complex that the activation is responsive to specific pathogens, host cell damage, and other environmental stimuli. Inflammasomes bring about the maturation of various pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-18 and IL-1β in order to mediate the innate immune defense mechanisms. Many RNA viruses and their components, such as encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) 2B viroporin, the viral RNA of hepatitis C virus, the influenza virus M2 viroporin, the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) small hydrophobic (SH) viroporin, and the human rhinovirus (HRV) 2B viroporin can activate the Nod-like receptor (NLR) family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome to influence the inflammatory response. On the other hand, several viruses use virus-encoded proteins to suppress inflammation activation, such as the influenza virus NS1 protein and the measles virus (MV) V protein. In this review, we summarize how RNA virus infection leads to the activation or inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome.","Choudhury, S K Mohiuddin; Ma, XuSheng; Abdullah, Sahibzada Waheed; Zheng, HaiXue",J Inflamm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33814921/; https://doi.org/10.2147/jir.s295706,554

The primary goal of this program was to ensure the safety of staff, patients, and the general public by training staff in the correct use of personal protective equipment (PPE) before, during, and after care of patients with EVD. METHODS: We delivered a 4-hour experiential training program to frontline health care professionals who would be expected to care for a patient with EVD. The program occurred in a simulation center with multiple flexible spaces and consisted of demonstration, multiple skills practice sessions, and a patient simulation case. We analyzed completed pre- and posttraining questionnaires. The questionnaire assessed their subjective level of confidence in three key areas: donning and doffing PPE, performing clinical skills while wearing PPE, and management of a contamination breach. RESULTS: This program was effectively deployed in the STRATUS Center for Medical Simulation over a 4-month period, with 220 health care professionals participating in the training and 195 participants completing the pre-/posttraining questionnaires. Our intervention significantly increased the confidence of participants on each primary objective (p = .001 for all three stations).
