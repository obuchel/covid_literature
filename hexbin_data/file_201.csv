504,504,504,Apolipoprotein M Gene (APOM) Polymorphism Modifies Metabolic and Disease Traits in Type 2 Diabetes,20.180328,8.667321,2011-02-24,"This study aimed at substantiating the associations of the apolipoproein M gene (APOM) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) as well as with metabolic traits in Hong Kong Chinese. In addition, APOM gene function was further characterized to elucidate its activity in cholesterol metabolism. Seventeen APOM SNPs documented in the NCBI database were genotyped. Five SNPs were confirmed in our study cohort of 1234 T2D and 606 control participants. Three of the five SNPs rs707921(C+1871A), rs707922(G+1837T) and rs805264(G+203A) were in linkage disequilibrium (LD). We chose rs707922 to tag this LD region for down stream association analyses and characterized the function of this SNP at molecular level. No association between APOM and T2D susceptibility was detected in our Hong Kong Chinese cohort. Interestingly, the C allele of rs805297 was significantly associated with T2D duration of longer than 10 years (OR = 1.245, p = 0.015). The rs707922 TT genotype was significantly associated with elevated plasma total- and LDL- cholesterol levels (p = 0.006 and p = 0.009, respectively) in T2D patients. Molecular analyses of rs707922 lead to the discoveries of a novel transcript APOM5 as well as the cryptic nature of exon 5 of the gene. Ectopic expression of APOM5 transcript confirmed rs707922 allele-dependent activity of the transcript in modifying cholesterol homeostasis in vitro. In conclusion, the results here did not support APOM as a T2D susceptibility gene in Hong Kong Chinese. However, in T2D patients, a subset of APOM SNPs was associated with disease duration and metabolic traits. Further molecular analysis proved the functional activity of rs707922 in APOM expression and in regulation of cellular cholesterol content.","Zhou, Jun-Wei; Tsui, Stephen K. W.; Ng, Maggie C.

860,860,860,Design Novel Dual Agonists for Treating Type-2 Diabetes by Targeting Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors with Core Hopping Approach,19.960144,8.37456,2012-06-07,"Owing to their unique functions in regulating glucose, lipid and cholesterol metabolism, PPARs (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors) have drawn special attention for developing drugs to treat type-2 diabetes. By combining the lipid benefit of PPAR-alpha agonists (such as fibrates) with the glycemic advantages of the PPAR-gamma agonists (such as thiazolidinediones), the dual PPAR agonists approach can both improve the metabolic effects and minimize the side effects caused by either agent alone, and hence has become a promising strategy for designing effective drugs against type-2 diabetes. In this study, by means of the powerful “core hopping” and “glide docking” techniques, a novel class of PPAR dual agonists was discovered based on the compound GW409544, a well-known dual agonist for both PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma modified from the farglitazar structure. It was observed by molecular dynamics simulations that these novel agonists not only possessed the same function as GW409544 did in activating PPAR-alpha and PPAR-gamma, but also had more favorable conformation for binding to the two receptors. It was further validated by the outcomes of their ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) predictions that the new agonists hold high potential to become drug candidates. Or at the very least, the findings reported here may stimulate new strategy or provide useful insights for discovering more effective dual agonists for treating type-2 diabetes. Since the “core hopping” technique allows for rapidly screening novel cores to help overcome unwanted properties by generating new lead compounds with improved core properties, it has not escaped our notice that the current strategy along with the corresponding computational procedures can also be utilized to find novel and more effective drugs for treating other illnesses.","Ma, Ying; Wang, Shu-Qing; Xu, Wei-Ren; Wang, Run-Ling; Chou, Kuo-Chen",PLoS One,201,1

About every third patient seen at this primary health station presented with signs of such infections. In the age groups <10, 10–19, 20–39, 40–59 and ≥60 years, respiratory tract infections accounted for 65, 45, 32, 18 and 9% of the total number of diagnoses made during 1974. The aetiology of acute respiratory tract infections in a series of patients seen at this health station was studied. The series included randomly selected cases, but excluded children under seven years of age and patients presenting with signs of acute otitis media and tonsillitis. Attempts to establish the aetiology were made on the basis of the history, the clinical examination, and cultures for beta-haemolytic streptococci andMycoplasma pneumoniae, complement fixation tests for influenza A and B, para-influenza 1, 2, and 3, adeno, cytomegalovirus and respiratory syncytial virus, andChlamydia psittaci. Paul-Bunnell test and tests for cold agglutinins were also performed. With this test battery, an aetiological diagnosis was obtained in only 33% of the 101 patients studied. The findings suggest an infection withM. pneumoniae in 16%, with beta-haemolytic streptococci in 9%, and with viruses (adeno and para-influenza) in 7% of the patients. The present communication highlights the role ofM. pneumoniae in upper respiratory infections, as few data have appeared on such infections in patients seen in general practice. The difficulty of establishing the aetiology of respiratory tract infections and the consequent treatment dilemma is discussed.","Mårdh, P. -A.; Hovelius, B.; Nordenfelt, E.; Rosenberg, R.; Soltesz, L.

However, their ability to provide ecologically relevant information remains controversial. One of the major problems is understanding whether the measured responses are determined by stress factors or lie within the natural variability range. In a previous work, the natural variability of enzymatic levels in invertebrates sampled in pristine rivers was proven to be relevant across both space and time. In the present study, the experimental design was improved by considering different life stages of the selected taxa and by measuring more environmental parameters. The experimental design considered sampling sites in 2 different rivers, 8 sampling dates covering the whole seasonal cycle, 4 species from 3 different taxonomic groups (Plecoptera, Perla grandis; Ephemeroptera, Baetis alpinus and Epeorus alpicula; Tricoptera, Hydropsyche pellucidula), different life stages for each species, and 4 enzymes (acetylcholinesterase, glutathione S‐transferase, alkaline phosphatase, and catalase). Biomarker levels were related to environmental (physicochemical) parameters to verify any kind of dependence. Data were statistically elaborated using hierarchical multilevel Bayesian models. Natural variability was found to be relevant across both space and time. The results of the present study proved that care should be paid when interpreting biomarker results. Further research is needed to better understand the dependence of the natural variability on environmental parameters.

DESIGN: Descriptive epidemiology and a case‐control study. SETTING: Two nursing homes (140 beds and 254 beds in nursing homes A and B, respectively) located in southern Ontario, Canada, experiencing outbreaks of respiratory tract infection in July and August 1994. SUBJECTS: Case‐residents of the two nursing homes who met clinical and laboratory criteria for Legionella infection. Control‐residents were defined as those who were in the homes during the outbreaks and were asymptomatic. MEASUREMENTS: Active surveillance was conducted in both nursing homes to identify symptomatic residents. Residents with fever or respiratory tract symptoms had nasopharyngeal swabs taken for viral antigen detection and culture, urine for Legionella antigen detection, and acute and convalescent serology for viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Legionella. Chest X‐rays were performed, and an attempt was made to obtain blood and sputum cultures. Water samples from shower heads, faucets, and air conditioning units were collected for Legionella culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. A case‐control study was done to assess possible risk factors for legionellosis. RESULTS: Twenty‐nine cases — 17 in nursing home A; 12 in nursing home B — were identified. Four (14%) case‐residents had documented pneumonia and four case‐residents died. Univariate analysis revealed that a history of stroke (odds ratio (OR) 2.3 (95% CI, 1.0–5.3)), eating pureed food (OR 4.6 (95% CI, 1.6–12.7)), and having fluids administered with medication (OR 2.5 (95% CI, 1.0–5.9)) were significant risk factors. Cases were less likely to wear dentures (OR .4 (95% CI, .2‐.9)) or to eat solid food (OR .3, (95% CI, .1‐.6)). Only eating pureed food remained significant in a multivariable analysis (OR 4.6 (95% CI, 1.6–13.0, P = .01)). CONCLUSION: This report describes outbreaks of legionellosis in two nursing homes, representing the first reported outbreaks of infection caused by Legionella sainthelensi. The association with illness of dietary characteristics indicative of swallowing disorders suggests that aspiration was the most likely mode of infection. The diagnosis of legionellosis should be considered during outbreaks of respiratory infection in nursing homes.

The aim of the study is to develop such a model in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients who receive certolizumab (CTZ) plus methotrexate (MTX) therapy, using individual participant data meta-analysis (IPD-MA). METHODS: We will search Cochrane CENTRAL, PubMed, and Scopus as well as clinical trial registries, drug regulatory agency reports, and the pharmaceutical company websites from their inception onwards to obtain randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating CTZ plus MTX compared with MTX alone in treating RA. We will request the individual-level data of these trials from an independent platform (http://vivli.org). The primary outcome is efficacy defined as achieving either remission (based on ACR-EULAR Boolean or index-based remission definition) or low disease activity (based on either of the validated composite disease activity measures). The secondary outcomes include ACR50 (50% improvement based on ACR core set variables) and adverse events. We will use a two-stage approach to develop the prediction model. First, we will construct a risk model for the outcomes via logistic regression to estimate the baseline risk scores. We will include baseline demographic, clinical, and biochemical features as covariates for this model. Next, we will develop a meta-regression model for treatment effects, in which the stage 1 risk score will be used both as a prognostic factor and as an effect modifier. We will calculate the probability of having the outcome for a new patient based on the model, which will allow estimation of the absolute and relative treatment effect. We will use R for our analyses, except for the second stage which will be performed in a Bayesian setting using R2Jags. DISCUSSION: This is a study protocol for developing a model to predict treatment response for RA patients receiving CTZ plus MTX in comparison with MTX alone, using a two-stage approach based on IPD-MA. The study will use a new modeling approach, which aims at retaining the statistical power. The model may help clinicians individualize treatment for particular patients.

Influenza A viruses are major human pathogens that are responsible for seasonal epidemics, but the interplay between viral proteins and cellular exonucleases has never been specifically studied. Here, using a stringent interactomics screening strategy and an siRNA-silencing approach, we identified eight cellular factors among a set of 75 cellular proteins carrying exo(ribo)nuclease activities or involved in RNA decay processes that support influenza A virus multiplication. We show that the exoribonuclease ERI1 interacts with the PB2, PB1 and NP components of the viral ribonucleoproteins and is required for viral mRNA transcription. More specifically, we demonstrate that the protein-protein interaction is RNA dependent and that both the RNA binding and exonuclease activities of ERI1 are required to promote influenza A virus transcription. Finally, we provide evidence that during infection, the SLBP protein and histone mRNAs co-purify with vRNPs alongside ERI1, indicating that ERI1 is most probably recruited when it is present in the histone pre-mRNA processing complex in the nucleus.","Declercq, Marion; Biquand, Elise; Karim, Marwah; Pietrosemoli, Natalia; Jacob, Yves; Demeret, Caroline; Barbezange, Cyril; van der Werf, Sylvie",Nucleic Acids Res,201,1

Antibiotics are the primary line of treatment for pneumococcal pneumonia; however, rising antimicrobial resistance is becoming more prevalent. Hinokitiol, which is isolated from trees in the cypress family, has been demonstrated to exert antibacterial activity against S. pneumoniae in vitro regardless of antimicrobial resistance. In this study, the efficacy of hinokitiol was investigated in a mouse pneumonia model. Male 8-week-old BALB/c mice were intratracheally infected with S. pneumoniae strains D39 (antimicrobial susceptible) and NU4471 (macrolide resistant). After 1 h, hinokitiol was injected via the tracheal route. Hinokitiol significantly decreased the number of S. pneumoniae in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and the concentration of pneumococcal DNA in the serum, regardless of whether bacteria were resistant or susceptible to macrolides. In addition, hinokitiol decreased the infiltration of neutrophils in the lungs, as well as the concentration of inflammatory cytokines in the BALF and serum. Repeated hinokitiol injection at 18 h intervals showed downward trend in the number of S. pneumoniae in the BALF and the concentration of S. pneumoniae DNA in the serum with the number of hinokitiol administrations. These findings suggest that hinokitiol reduced bacterial load and suppressed excessive host immune response in the pneumonia mouse model. Accordingly, hinokitiol warrants further exploration as a potential candidate for the treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia.","Isono, Toshihito; Domon, Hisanori; Nagai, Kosuke; Maekawa, Tomoki; Tamura, Hikaru; Hiyoshi, Takumi; Yanagihara, Katsunori; Kunitomo, Eiji; Takenaka, Shoji; Noiri, Yuichiro; Terao, Yutaka",PLoS One,201,1

Understanding the sources of risk is important for prevention and treatment. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the risks of suicide and drug poisoning deaths among adult men whose adolescent occupational expectations were not met in adulthood. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included a sample of men interviewed as part of the High School and Beyond study, a nationally representative study of US high school sophomores and seniors in 1980, who were interviewed every 2 years through 1986; those who were sophomores in 1980 were reinterviewed in 1992. Men who survived to 1992 and reported occupational expectations were included in the present study. Death records prior to 2018 were linked to mortality databases and released in 2019. Data analysis was conducted from May to October 2020. EXPOSURE: Occupational expectations. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Survival or death by suicide, drug poisoning, chronic liver disease, heart disease, cancer, or some other cause, categorized from International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision and Tenth Revision codes. Competing risk Fine-Gray survival models regressed cause of death on adolescent occupational expectations and covariates. RESULTS: The 11 680 men in the High School and Beyond cohort study had a median (interquartile range) age of 29 (28-30) years in 1992, when the analysis of their future mortality began. Most men survived until 2015 (11 060 [weighted percentage, 95.0%]). Reported causes of death were suicide (60 [weighted percentage, 0.5%]), drug poisoning (40 [weighted percentage, 0.4%]), chronic liver disease (20 [weighted percentage, 0.2%]), heart disease (130 [weighted percentage, 1.0%]), cancer (100 [weighted percentage, 1.0%]), and other (280 [weighted percentage, 2.0%]).

The actual job held by men did not attenuate the hazards of deaths from suicide and drug poisoning. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, men whose occupational expectations were not met because of labor market declines were at a higher risk of death from suicide or drug poisoning than men with different occupational expectations.

This study investigated the genetic variability of 15 G12 rotavirus strains associated with either P[6] or P[8] identified between 2010 and 2014 from Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Togo and Zambia. METHODS: The investigation was carried out by comparing partial VP7 and partial VP4 sequences of the African G12P[6] and G12P[8] strains with the available GenBank sequences and exploring the recognized neutralization epitopes of these strains. Additionally, Bayesian evolutionary analysis was carried out using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implemented in BEAST to estimate the time to the most recent ancestor and evolutionary rate for these G12 rotavirus strains. RESULTS: The findings suggested that the VP7 and VP4 nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the G12 strains circulating in African countries are closely related, irrespective of country of origin and year of detection, with the exception of the Ethiopian strains that clustered distinctly. Neutralization epitope analysis revealed that rotavirus VP4 P[8] genes associated with G12 had amino acid sequences similar to those reported globally including the vaccine strains in RotaTeq and Rotarix. The estimated evolutionary rate of the G12 strains was 1.016 × 10(− 3) substitutions/site/year and was comparable to what has been previously reported. Three sub-clusters formed within the current circulating lineage III shows the diversification of G12 from three independent ancestries within a similar time frame in the late 1990s. CONCLUSIONS: At present it appears to be unlikely that widespread vaccine use has driven the molecular evolution and sustainability of G12 strains in Africa. Continuous monitoring of rotavirus genotypes is recommended to assess the long-term impact of rotavirus vaccination on the dynamic nature of rotavirus evolution on the continent.

Experience from investigator-led studies prior to ELIANA suggests that infections and inflammatory conditions may exacerbate the severity of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) associated with CAR-T cell therapy, leading to extreme caution and strong restrictions for on-study and commercial infusion of tisagenlecleucel in patients with active infection. CRS intervention with interleukin (IL)-6 blockade and/or steroid therapy was introduced late in the course during clinical trials due to concern for potential negative effect on efficacy and persistence. However, earlier CRS intervention is now viewed more favorably. Earlier intervention and consistency in management between providers may promote broader use of tisagenlecleucel, including potential curative therapy in patients who require remission and recovery of hematopoiesis for management of severe infection. MAIN BODY: Patient 1 was diagnosed with B-ALL at 23 years old. Fourteen days before tisagenlecleucel infusion, the patient developed fever and neutropenia and was diagnosed with invasive Mucorales infection and BK virus hemorrhagic cystitis. Aggressive measures were instituted to control infection and to manage prolonged cytopenias during CAR-T cell manufacturing. Adverse events, including CRS, were manageable despite elevated inflammatory markers and active infection. The patient attained remission and recovered hematopoiesis, and infections resolved. The patient remains in remission ≥1 year postinfusion. Patient 2 was diagnosed with pre–B-ALL at preschool age. She developed severe septic shock 3 days postinitiation of lymphodepleting chemotherapy. After receiving tisagenlecleucel, she experienced CRS with cardiac dysfunction and extensive lymphadenopathy leading to renovascular compromise. The patient attained remission and was discharged in good condition to her country of origin. She remained in remission but expired on day 208 postinfusion due to cardiac arrest of unclear etiology. CONCLUSIONS: Infusion was feasible, and toxicity related to tisagenlecleucel was manageable despite active infections and concurrent inflammation, allowing attainment of remission in otherwise refractory pediatric/young adult ALL. This may lead to consideration of tisagenlecleucel as a potential curative therapy in patients with managed active infections.","Hall, Erin M; Yin, Dwight E; Goyal, Rakesh K; Ahmed, Atif A; Mitchell, Grace S; St. Peter, Shawn D; Flatt, Terrie G; Ahmed, Ibrahim A; Li, Weijie; Hendrickson, Richard J; August, Keith J; Myers, G Doug",J Immunother Cancer,201,1

We determined if there were differences in dead space and alveolar ventilation in ventilated infants with pulmonary disease or no respiratory morbidity. METHODS: A prospective study of mechanically ventilated infants was undertaken. Expiratory tidal volume and carbon dioxide levels were measured. Volumetric capnograms were constructed to calculate the dead space using the modified Bohr–Enghoff equation. Alveolar ventilation (V(A)) was also calculated. RESULTS: Eighty-one infants with a median (range) gestational age of 28.7 (22.4–41.9) weeks were recruited. The dead space [median (IQR)] was higher in 35 infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) [5.7 (5.1–7.0) ml/kg] and in 26 infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) [6.4 (5.1–7.5) ml/kg] than in 20 term controls with no respiratory disease [3.5 (2.8–4.2) ml/kg, p < 0.001]. Minute ventilation was higher in both infants with RDS or BPD compared to the controls. V(A) in infants with RDS or BPD was similar to that of the controls [p = 0.54]. CONCLUSION: Prematurely born infants with pulmonary disease have a higher dead space than term controls, which may influence the optimum level during volume-targeted ventilation. IMPACT: Measurement of the dead space was feasible in ventilated newborn infants. The physiological dead space was a significant proportion of the delivered volume in ventilated infants. The dead space (per kilogram) was higher in ventilated infants with respiratory distress syndrome or evolving bronchopulmonary dysplasia compared to term controls without respiratory disease. The dead space volume should be considered when calculating the most appropriate volume during volume-targeted ventilation.","Williams, Emma; Dassios, Theodore; Dixon, Paul; Greenough, Anne",Pediatr Res,201,33

This was a systematic review to summarize the studies on the prevalence of Adv36 infection and its association with human obesity. METHODS: A systematic literature review was conducted using the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA). Observational or experimental studies found in the Medline, Embase, LILACS, Science Direct and SciELO databases that presented results on the prevalence of Adv36 in humans were included. RESULTS: Thirty-seven studies were screened. A total of 10,300 adults aged 18–70 years and 4585 children and adolescents aged 3–18 years were assessed. The average prevalence of Adv36 among adults was 22.9%, ranging from 5.5% to 49.8%. Among children and adolescents, the average prevalence of Adv36 was 28.9%, ranging from 7.5% to 73.9%. There was a positive statistical relationship between Adv36 and weight gain, obesity, or metabolic changes in 31 studies. However, in four studies there was no association with obesity, and in one, no association was described. One of the studies showed an inverse correlation, i.e., Adv36 was a protective factor against obesity. CONCLUSION: Strong evidence suggested a positive association between viral infection and obesity. However, due to the multi-causality of obesity and heterogeneity of studies, diagnostic tests should be standardized and easily accessible by the population to estimate the overall prevalence of Adv36 infection and its association with obesity.","da Silva Fernandes, Jaime; Schuelter-Trevisol, Fabiana; Cancelier, Ana Carolina Lobor; Gonçalves e Silva, Helena Caetano; de Sousa, Daiana Gomes; Atkinson, Richard L.; Trevisol, Daisson José",Int J Obes (Lond),201,22

This narrative review focuses primarily on the major bioactive RAS peptide, Angiotensin II (Ang II), and its receptors, namely type 1 (AT1R) and type 2 (AT2R). Both receptors are involved in the development of NP and represent potential therapeutic targets. We first discuss the potential role of Ang II receptors in modulation of NP in the central nervous system. Ang II receptor expression is widespread in circuits associated with the perception and modulation of pain, but more studies are required to fully characterize receptor distribution, downstream signaling, and therapeutic potential of targeting the central nervous system RAS in NP. We then describe the peripheral neuronal and nonneuronal distribution of the RAS, and its contribution to NP. Other RAS modulators (such as Ang (1-7)) are briefly reviewed as well. AT1R antagonists are analgesic across different pain models, including NP. Several studies show neuronal protection and outgrowth downstream of AT2R activation, which may lead to the use of AT2R agonists in NP. However, blockade of AT2R results in analgesia. Furthermore, expression of the RAS in the immune system and a growing appreciation of neuroimmune crosstalk in NP add another layer of complexity and therapeutic potential of targeting this pathway. A growing number of human studies also hint at the analgesic potential of targeting Ang II signaling. Altogether, Ang II receptor signaling represents a promising, far-reaching, and novel strategy to treat NP.","Balogh, Mihály; Aguilar, Clarissa; Nguyen, Nicholas T.; Shepherd, Andrew J.",Pain Rep,201,1

METHODS: Adult patients with hypoxemia weaning from mechanical ventilation were identified from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database. The patients were assigned to the treatment group or control group according to whether they were receiving HFNC or non-invasive ventilation (NIV) after extubation. The 28-day mortality and 28-day reintubation rates were compared between the two groups after Propensity score matching (PSM). The predictor for reintubation was formulated according to the risk factors with the XGBoost algorithm. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated for reintubation prediction according to values at 4 h after extubation, which was compared with the ratio of SpO(2)/FiO(2) to respiratory rate (ROX index). RESULTS: A total of 524,520 medical records were screened, and 801 patients with moderate or severe hypoxemia when undergoing mechanical ventilation weaning were included (100 < PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300 mmHg), including 358 patients who received HFNC therapy after extubation in the treatment group. There were 315 patients with severe hypoxemia (100 < PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 200 mmHg) before extubation, and 190 patients remained in the treatment group with median oxygenation index 166[157,180] mmHg after PSM. There were no significant differences in the 28-day reintubation rate or 28-day mortality between the two groups with moderate or severe hypoxemia (all P > 0.05). Then HR/SpO(2) was formulated as a predictor for 48-h reintubation according to the important features predicting weaning failure. According to values at 4 h after extubation, the AUC of HR/SpO(2) was 0.657, which was larger than that of ROX index (0.583). When the HR/SpO(2) reached 1.2 at 4 h after extubation, the specificity for 48-h reintubation prediction was 93%. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment effect of HFNC therapy is not inferior to that of NIV, even on patients with oxygenation index from 160 to 180 mmHg when weaning from ventilator. HR/SpO(2) is more early and accurate in predicting HFNC failure than ROX index.","Liu, Taotao; Zhao, Qinyu; Du, Bin",BMC Pulm Med,201,12

Among many challenges in PoC clinical trial design and analysis, the application of multiplicity comparison procedures (MCP) is frequently discussed when multiple doses or drugs are included in one PoC study. In such discussion, one fundamental question of applying multiplicity adjustment is which error one should consider to control and at what level. Should it be the experiment-wise error or the compound-wise error? In this paper, the multiplicity issues in two cases of PoC studies are used as examples to discuss the concept of different types of error and the level of the error rate control. With a clear understanding of the type of error and error rate control, the debate of applications of the multiplicity adjustment procedures in the PoC studies can be reconciled.","Li, Qian H.; Deng, Qiqi; Ting, Naitee",Ther Innov Regul Sci,201,1

An online survey was distributed during November through December 2018 via email and phone to veterinarians and para-veterinarians to collect information on antibiotic use practices. Data were downloaded into Excel and descriptive statistics were presented and analysed. The survey was completed by 390 respondents. Almost all respondents (98.5%, 384/390) recommended the use of antibiotics to treat animal patients, and of these, 93.2% (358/384) were veterinarians and 6.8% (26/384) were para-veterinarians. Most respondents reported commonly recommending the use of oxytetracycline (82.6%, 317/384), tylosin (44.5%, 171/384) and gentamycin (43.8%, 168/384). A third (32.0%, 122/384) of respondents did not undertake antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) prior to antibiotic treatment. At least 60% of the respondents recommended the use of antibiotics for the treatment of non-bacterial pathogens, including viral, helminth and fungal pathogens. Over 55% (217/390) were not aware of government-issued guidelines on antibiotic use in animals, although of those aware, 69% (74/107) utilised the guidelines. Across all respondents, the majority believed legislation or regulation by government can influence the use of antibiotics by animal health professionals. The study highlights areas that can be targeted as part of intervention strategies to promote antimicrobial stewardship by animal health professionals in Nigeria, including the need for increased use of AST as a tool for supporting disease management, increased awareness of appropriate antibiotic use and greater dissemination of antibiotic use guidelines and enforcement of relevant regulation by government authorities.","Ogwuche, Adah; Ekiri, Abel B.; Endacott, Isabella; Maikai, Beatty-Viv; Idoga, Enokela S.; Alafiatayo, Ruth; Cook, Alasdair J.C.",J S Afr Vet Assoc,201,1

Hence, migrant children may experience a sense of relative deprivation when they feel they are treated unjustly when compared to their urban counterparts. Although previous research has demonstrated that relative deprivation is a risk factor for prosocial tendencies, this association has not yet been examined in the population of migrant children in China. Further, few studies have revealed the mediating and moderating mechanisms between relative deprivation and prosocial tendencies. Therefore, this study constructed an integrated model examining the possible mediating role of perceived social support and moderating role of in-group identity on the association between relative deprivation and prosocial tendencies. A large sample of 1,630 Chinese rural-to-urban migrant children (845 girls; M(age) = 12.30, SD = 1.74) completed a battery of self-report questionnaires regarding relative deprivation, prosocial tendencies, perceived social support, in-group identity, and demographic variables. The results indicated that relative deprivation was negatively correlated with migrant children's prosocial tendencies and this connection was partially mediated by perceived social support. Moderated mediation analysis further indicated that in-group identity moderated the effect of perceived social support on prosocial tendencies, with a high level of in-group identity strengthening the positive association between perceived social support and prosocial tendencies. Parents, educators, and other members of society concerned about migrant children's psychosocial adaptation should provide adequate social support resources and help them foster positive in-group identity to migrant populations to mitigate the adverse effects of relative deprivation and promote their prosocial tendencies.","Xiong, Meng; Xiao, Lei; Ye, Yiduo",Front Psychol,201,1

With 11 official languages, South Africans experience language barriers amongst themselves, which pose unique communication challenges on a daily basis. It is thus important to explore how radiographers overcome such challenges to provide an effective service to their patients. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore and describe the experiences of radiographers in Gauteng province in communicating with patients in a multilingual, multicultural healthcare setting and make recommendations towards overcoming such barriers. SETTING: The focus group discussions were conducted in English and at a private location that was convenient for the participants in Gauteng. METHOD: The study employed a qualitative phenomenological approach using focus group interviews (FGIs) to solicit the experiences of participants and gain an in-depth understanding of the phenomenon. RESULTS: The findings showed that patient–radiographer cross-cultural communication is ineffective whilst language barriers are encountered daily. Participants subsequently offered a number of recommendations to enhance communication with patients from different cultural and linguistic backgrounds. These included workshops or short courses to improve language skills, posters to allow for non-verbal communication, the use of professional interpreters or mobile translation technology, employment of a diverse workforce and a focus on cultural sensitivity and learning an additional language at tertiary level. CONCLUSION: Although a variety of communication strategies are available, the most appropriate combination should be explored for individual radiology practices in order to serve their respective diverse patient base. Recommendations that emanated from this study can, therefore, be used as a guide to radiology practices to facilitate effective patient–radiographer communication.","van Vuuren, Cherise Janse; van Dyk, Barbara; Mokoena, Padidi L.",Health SA,201,22

However, the mechanisms underlying this protection remain unclear. In this work, two recent radiation-attenuated sporozoite vaccination studies were used to identify potential transcriptional correlates of vaccination-induced protection. METHODS: Longitudinal whole blood RNAseq transcriptome responses to immunization with radiation-attenuated P. falciparum sporozoites were analysed and compared across malaria-naïve adult participants (IMRAS) and malaria-experienced adult participants (BSPZV1). Parasite dose and method of delivery differed between trials, and immunization regimens were designed to achieve incomplete protective efficacy. Observed protective efficacy was 55% in IMRAS and 20% in BSPZV1. Study vaccine dosings were chosen to elicit both protected and non-protected subjects, so that protection-associated responses could be identified. RESULTS: Analysis of comparable time points up to 1 week after the first vaccination revealed a shared cross-study transcriptional response programme, despite large differences in number and magnitude of differentially expressed genes between trials. A time-dependent regulatory programme of coherent blood transcriptional modular responses was observed, involving induction of inflammatory responses 1–3 days post-vaccination, with cell cycle responses apparent by day 7 in protected individuals from both trials. Additionally, strongly increased induction of inflammation and interferon-associated responses was seen in non-protected IMRAS participants. All individuals, except for non-protected BSPZV1 participants, showed robust upregulation of cell-cycle associated transcriptional responses post vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, despite stark differences between the two studies, including route of vaccination and status of malaria exposure, responses were identified that were associated with protection after PfRAS vaccination. These comprised a moderate early interferon response peaking 2 days post vaccination, followed by a later proliferative cell cycle response steadily increasing over the first 7 days post vaccination. Non-protection is associated with deviations from this model, observed in this study with over-induction of early interferon responses in IMRAS and failure to mount a cell cycle response in BSPZV1.

The Serious Illness Care Program (SICP) is a multifaceted communication intervention that builds capacity for clinicians to have earlier, more frequent, and more person-centered conversations. OBJECTIVE: To explore clinicians’ experiences with the SICP 1 year after implementation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This qualitative study was conducted at 2 tertiary care hospitals in Canada. The SICP was implemented at Hamilton General Hospital (Hamilton, Ontario) from March 1, 2017, to January 19, 2018, and at Foothills Medical Centre (Calgary, Alberta) from March 1, 2018, to December 31, 2020. A total of 45 clinicians were invited to participate in the study, and 23 clinicians (51.1%) were enrolled and interviewed. Semistructured interviews of clinicians were conducted between August 2018 and May 2019. Content analysis was used to evaluate information obtained from these interviews between May 2019 and May 2020. EXPOSURES: The SICP includes clinician training, communication tools, and processes for system change. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinicians’ experiences with and perceptions of the SICP. RESULTS: Among 23 clinicians interviewed, 15 (65.2%) were women. The mean (SD) number of years in practice was 14.6 (9.1) at the Hamilton site and 12.0 (6.9) at the Calgary site. Participants included 19 general internists, 3 nurse practitioners, and 1 social worker. The 3 main themes were the ways in which the SICP (1) supported changes in clinician behavior, (2) shifted the focus of goals-of-care conversations beyond discussion of code status, and (3) influenced clinicians personally and professionally. Changes in clinician behavior were supported by having a unit champion, interprofessional engagement, access to copies of the Serious Illness Conversation Guide, and documentation in the electronic medical record. Elements of the program, especially the Serious Illness Conversation Guide, shifted the focus of goals-of-care conversations beyond discussion of code status and influenced clinicians on personal and professional levels. Concerns with the program included finding time to have conversations, building transient relationships, and limiting conversation fluidity. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this qualitative study, hospital clinicians described components of the SICP as supporting changes in their behavior and facilitating meaningful patient interactions that shifted the focus of goals-of-care conversations beyond discussion of code status. The perceived benefits of SICP implementation stimulated uptake within the medical units. These findings suggest that the SICP may prompt hospital culture changes in goals-of-care dialogue with patients and the care of hospitalized patients with serious illness.","Lagrotteria, Andrew; Swinton, Marilyn; Simon, Jessica; King, Seema; Boryski, Gwenn; Ma, Irene Wai Yan; Dunne, Fiona; Singh, Japteg; Bernacki, Rachelle E.; You, John J.",JAMA Netw Open,201,22

This study randomized applications to 2 population-health doctoral programs at the University of California San Francisco to assess whether masking reviewers to applicant GRE results differentially affects reviewers’ scores for underrepresented minority (URM) applicants from 2018–2020. Applications with GRE results and those without were randomly assigned to reviewers to designate scores for each copy (1–10, 1 being best). URM was defined as self-identification as African American/Black, Filipino, Hmong, Vietnamese, Hispanic/Latinx, Native American/Alaska Native, or Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander. We used linear mixed models with random effects for the applicant and fixed effects for each reviewer to evaluate the effect of masking the GRE results on the overall application score and whether this effect differed by URM status. Reviewer scores did not significantly differ for unmasked versus masked applications among non-URM applicants (β = 0.15; 95% CI: −0.03, 0.33) or URM applicants (β = 0.02, 95% CI: −0.49, 0.54). We did not find evidence that removing GREs differentially affected URM compared with non-URM students (β for interaction = −0.13, 95% CI: −0.55, 0.29).

Healthy rats received four subcutaneous injections of the vaccine at biweekly intervals. Two weeks after the last vaccination, anti-PCSK9 antibody titers, PCSK9 targeting, and inhibition of PCSK9–low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) interaction were evaluated. After verification of antibody generation, the immunized rats were intraperitoneally treated with a single dose (45 mg/kg) of streptozotocin (STZ) to induce diabetes mellitus. The levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG) were measured, and the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as well as the insulin tolerance test (ITT) were carried out to assess glycemic status. At the end of the study, the total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were assayed. Histopathology examination of the liver and pancreas was also performed using the hematoxylin-eosin staining method. RESULTS: The prepared nanoliposomal vaccine could strongly induce anti-PCSK9 antibodies in the vaccinated rats. Within one week following the STZ injection, the FBG level was lower in the vaccinated group vs. diabetic control group (49% (−171.7 ± 35 mg/dL, p < 0.001)). In the OGTT, the injected rats showed improved glucose tolerance as reflected by the reduction of blood glucose levels over 180 min, compared with the diabetic controls. Moreover, the ITT demonstrated that, after the insulin injection, blood glucose concentration declined by 49.3% in the vaccinated group vs. diabetic control group. Expectedly, the vaccinated rats exhibited lower (-26.65%, p = 0.03) plasma LDL-C levels compared with the diabetic controls. Histopathology examination of pancreas tissue demonstrated that the pancreatic islets of the vaccinated rats had a slight decline in the population of β-cells and few α-cells. Normal liver histology was also observed in the vaccinated rats.

The extremely diverse roles of the nucleolar helicase DDX21, ranging from fundamental cellular processes such as cell growth, ribosome biogenesis, protein translation, protein–protein interaction, mediating and sensing transcription, and gene regulation to viral manipulation, drew our attention. We designed this project to study virus–host interactions and viral pathogenesis. A pulldown assay was used to investigate the association between foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) and DDX21. Further insight into the DDX21–FMDV interaction was obtained through dual-luciferase, knockdown, overexpression, qPCR, and confocal microscopy assays. Our results highlight the antagonistic feature of DDX21 against FMDV, as it progressively inhibited FMDV internal ribosome entry site (IRES) -dependent translation through association with FMDV IRES domains 2, 3, and 4. To subvert this host helicase antagonism, FMDV degraded DDX21 through its non-structural proteins 2B, 2C, and 3C protease (3C(pro)). Our results suggest that DDX21 is degraded during 2B and 2C overexpression and FMDV infection through the caspase pathway; however, DDX21 is degraded through the lysosomal pathway during 3C(pro) overexpression. Further investigation showed that DDX21 enhanced interferon-beta and interleukin-8 production to restrict viral replication. Together, our results demonstrate that DDX21 is a novel FMDV IRES trans-acting factor, which negatively regulates FMDV IRES-dependent translation and replication.","Abdullah, Sahibzada Waheed; Wu, Jin’en; Zhang, Yun; Bai, Manyuan; Guan, Junyong; Liu, Xiangtao; Sun, Shiqi; Guo, Huichen",Viruses,201,1

To ensure the safety of new vaccines, preclinical toxicology studies are conducted prior to the initiation of, and concurrently with, clinical studies. There are five different types of preclinical toxicology study in the evaluation of vaccine safety: single and/or repeat dose, reproductive and developmental, mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, and safety pharmacology. If any adverse effects are observed in the course of these studies, they should be fully evaluated and a final safety decision made accordingly.

We bring in insights from prior literature and use an illustrative case study of an Italian SME to demonstrate the interplay of entrepreneurial and non-entrepreneurial behaviour during the internationalization process. Our study shows that the combination of entrepreneurial and non-entrepreneurial internationalization cannot be fully explained with existing International Entrepreneurship literature or other internationalization theories, as they do not take into account the nonlinear nature of internationalization or explain why the process seems to reach a ‘glass ceiling’ beyond which it does not progress. The study concludes with a conceptual framework providing an alternative explanation. Based on our conceptual reasoning we propose that predominantly non-entrepreneurial internationalization can occur without developing a clearly defined internationalization strategy. Additionally, we argue that low commitment to internationalization prevents capability development and may lead to nonlinear internationalization. Furthermore, we suggest that family involvement may moderate a firm’s international entrepreneurial orientation, consequently leading to more non-entrepreneurial internationalization.","Nummela, Niina; Vissak, Tiia; Francioni, Barbara",Int Entrep Manag J,201,1

Recent animal studies have suggested that epinephrine may decrease cerebral blood flow (CBF) and cerebral oxygenation, possibly potentiating neurological injury during CPR. We investigated the cerebrovascular effects of intravenous epinephrine in a swine model of pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest. The primary objectives of this study were to determine if (1) epinephrine doses have a significant acute effect on CBF and cerebral tissue oxygenation during CPR and (2) if the effect of each subsequent dose of epinephrine differs significantly from that of the first. METHODS: One-month-old piglets (n = 20) underwent asphyxia for 7 min, ventricular fibrillation, and CPR for 10–20 min. Epinephrine (20 mcg/kg) was administered at 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18 min of CPR. Invasive (laser Doppler, brain tissue oxygen tension [PbtO(2)]) and noninvasive (diffuse correlation spectroscopy and diffuse optical spectroscopy) measurements of CBF and cerebral tissue oxygenation were simultaneously recorded. Effects of subsequent epinephrine doses were compared to the first. RESULTS: With the first epinephrine dose during CPR, CBF and cerebral tissue oxygenation increased by > 10%, as measured by each of the invasive and noninvasive measures (p < 0.001). The effects of epinephrine on CBF and cerebral tissue oxygenation decreased with subsequent doses. By the fifth dose of epinephrine, there were no demonstrable increases in CBF of cerebral tissue oxygenation. Invasive and noninvasive CBF measurements were highly correlated during asphyxia (slope effect 1.3, p < 0.001) and CPR (slope effect 0.20, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This model suggests that epinephrine increases CBF and cerebral tissue oxygenation, but that effects wane following the third dose. Noninvasive measurements of neurological health parameters hold promise for developing and directing resuscitation strategies.","Mavroudis, Constantine D.; Ko, Tiffany S.; Morgan, Ryan W.; Volk, Lindsay E.; Landis, William P.; Smood, Benjamin; Xiao, Rui; Hefti, Marco; Boorady, Timothy W.; Marquez, Alexandra; Karlsson, Michael; Licht, Daniel J.; Nadkarni, Vinay M.; Berg, Robert A.; Sutton, Robert M.; Kilbaugh, Todd J.",Crit Care,201,5

The results show that the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) and radiative recombination rate are remarkably improved with AlInGaN step-graded EBL and QLQB as compared to conventional or ternary AlGaN EBL and last quantum barrier (LQB). This significant improvement is assigned to the optimal recombination of electron–hole pairs in the multiple quantum wells (MQWs). It is due to the decrease in strain and lattice mismatch between the epi-layers which alleviates the effective potential barrier height of the conduction band and suppressed the electron leakage without affecting the holes transportation to the active region. Moreover, to figure out quantitatively, the electron and hole quantity increased by ~ 25% and ~ 15%, respectively. Additionally, the IQE and radiative recombination rate are enhanced by 48% and 55%, respectively, as compared to conventional LED. So, we believe that our proposed structure is not only a feasible approach for achieving highly efficient DUV LEDs, but the device physics presented in this study establishes a fruitful understanding of III nitride-based optoelectronic devices.","Jamil, Tariq; Usman, Muhammad; Malik, Shahzeb; Jamal, Habibullah",Appl Phys A Mater Sci Process,201,1

The aim of the present study was to assess the role of a (MWYF) decoction in a bleomycin (BLM)-induced PF mouse model and to investigate the underlying functional mechanism. Chemical components within the MWYF decoction were analysed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 50 C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to one of the following five groups with 10 mice per group: Control, model, low dose MWYF (20 g/kg), medium dose MWYF (40 g/kg) and high dose MWYF (60 g/kg). A mouse PF model was established by the tracheal instillation of BLM (5 mg/kg) prior to MWYF treatment, except for mice in the control group. After 21 days of treatment with MWYF, the mice were sacrificed and the body weights were recorded. In addition, pulmonary tissues and bronchial alveolar lavage fluid were collected. TNF-α, IL-6, IL-17, hydroxyproline, pyridinoline and collagen I levels were determined using ELISA. Vimentin, α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), fibronectin, TGF-β1, Smad3, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-17, collagen I and collagen III were determined using western blotting. Vimentin and α-SMA levels were also determined using immunofluorescence analysis. Collagens I and III were detected using immunohistochemical analysis and TGF-β1 and Smad3 levels were determined using reverse transcription-quantitative PCR. Following treatment with MWYF decoction, the body weight of the mice in the PF group increased, the degree of pulmonary alveolitis and PF was reduced, collagen levels were reduced and the expression levels of α-SMA, vimentin and fibronectin were decreased. Although both protein and mRNA expression levels of TGF-β1 and Smad3 were reduced, they remained higher than those observed in the control group. To conclude, MWYF decoction delayed the development of BLM-induced PF in mice, where the functional mechanism was likely associated with the TGF-β1/Smad3 signalling pathway.","Xu, Yong; Peng, Wenpan; Han, Di; Feng, Fanchao; Wang, Zhichao; Gu, Cheng; Zhou, Xianmei; Wu, Qi",Exp Ther Med,201,1

We examined the association between renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade and COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis in a large population-based cohort of patients with hypertension. METHODS: This is a cohort study using regional health records. We identified all individuals aged 18-95 years from 87 health care reference areas of the main health provider in Catalonia(Spain), with a history of hypertension from primary care records. Data were linked to COVID-19 test results, hospital, pharmacy and mortality records from 1 March 2020 to 14 August 2020. We defined exposure to RAS blockers as the dispensation of ACEi/ARBs during the three months before COVID-19 diagnosis or 1 March 2020. Primary outcomes were: COVID-19 infection, and severe progression in hospitalized patients with COVID-19(the composite of need for invasive respiratory support or death). For both outcomes and for each exposure of interest (RAAS blockade, ACEi or ARB) we estimated associations in age-sex-area-propensity matched samples. RESULTS: From a cohort of 1,365,215 inhabitants we identified 305,972 patients with hypertension history. Recent use of ACEi/ARBs in patients with hypertension was associated with a lower 6 month-cumulative incidence of COVID-19 diagnosis (3.78% [95% CI: 3.69% - 3.86%] vs 4.53% [95% CI: 4.40% - 4.65%]; p < 0.001). In the 12,344 patients with COVID-19 infection, the use of ACEi/ARBs was not associated with a higher risk of hospitalization with need for invasive respiratory support or death (OR = 0.91 (0.71 – 1.15); p = 0.426). CONCLUSION: RAS blockade in patients with hypertension is not associated with higher risk of COVID-19 infection or with a worse progression of the disease.","Soler, Maria José; Ribera, Aida; Marsal, Josep R; Mendez, Ana Belen; Andres, Mireia; Azancot, Maria Antonia; Oristrell, Gerard; Méndez-Boo, Leonardo; Cohen, Jordana; Barrabés, Jose A; Ferreira-González, Ignacio",Clin Kidney J,201,23

We conducted a systematic review to examine the barriers and enablers to patient recruitment for randomised controlled trials on chronic wound treatment. Review registration was under PROSPERO 2017:CRD42017062438. We conducted a systematic search of Ovid MEDLINE, EBSCOhost CINAHL, Ovid Cochrane Library, Ovid EMBASE, and Ovid PsycINFO databases in June 2017 for chronic wound treatment randomised controlled trials. Twenty-seven randomised controlled trials or qualitative studies met the inclusion criteria. Among the 24 randomised controlled trials, 21 were assessed as low quality in relation to recruitment, and 3 were assessed as high quality. All 27 studies reported barriers to recruitment in chronic wound randomised controlled trials. The reported barriers to recruitment were: study-related, patient-related, clinician-related, health system-related, and/or operational-related. No study reported recruitment enablers. To enhance randomised controlled trial recruitment, we propose the need for improved integration of research and clinical practice. To alleviate the problems arising from inadequate reporting of randomised controlled trials, the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Statement could include an additional item on recruitment barriers. This approach will allow for increased awareness of the potential barriers to recruitment for Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) in both wound management and other health care research.","Bugeja, Lyndal; Low, Jac Kee; McGinnes, Rosemary A; Team, Victoria; Sinha, Sankar; Weller, Carolina",International wound journal,201,1

A motion analysis system and a surface Electromyography were used to collect ten cycles of three-dimensional kinematics and muscles activity during 2 min of pedaling in each of four testing conditions. The paired t-test was used for statistical analysis (p < 0.05). RESULTS The results indicated significant differences in VM (band = 0.029, no band = 0.031) and VL (band = 0.015, no band = 0.035) activation between workloads in each condition. Also there were significant differences in Gmed activation (0.5kg = 0.001, 2kg = 0.037), onset of Gmed (0.5kg = 0.048, 2kg = 0.012), offset of Gmed (0.5kg = 0.048, 2kg = 0.015), TFL activation (0.5kg = 0.001, 2kg = 0.041) and offset of TFL (0.5kg = 0.078, 2kg = 0.005) between the band and no band conditions. There was no different significant in VM/VL ratio between in each of four testing conditions (p > 0.05). The Gmed/TFL ratio was significantly greater in band condition than no band at both 0.5 (p = 0.045) and 2 kg (p = 0.001) workload. Knee abduction angle was affected by the band loop during the pedaling at two different workloads (0.5 kg: p = 0.047, 2 kg: p = 0.021) but mean (p = 0.027) and peak (p = 0.033) knee abduction angle significantly increased with increasing workload during the pedaling with band loop. CONCLUSIONS pedaling with the band loop can be considered as an effective method to increase the Gmed, Gmed/TFL ratio and control of DKV but increasing the workload during pedaling must be done with caution.","Heydarian, Mona; Babakhani, Farideh; Hatefi, Mohamadreza; Balouchi, Ramin; Mohammadian, Mohammadamin",Gait & posture,201,0

The objective of the current study was to establish a reference dataset for Indian patients of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) presenting with brain metastases (BM). MATERIAL AND METHODS One hundred forty patients with NSCLC with BM treated between 2012-2015 were registered in a prospective cohort study (CTRI/2013/01/003299). The baseline quality of life was evaluated using the EORTC general quality of life questionnaire QLQ-C30 and lung cancer specific module LC13. Minimum important difference (MID) scores for individual domains of the EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13 questionnaires were derived (MID = 0.2 x standard deviation) from the reference data for patients with recurrent/metastatic lung cancers. In addition, a systematic review was conducted to identify studies reporting baseline quality of life scores for recurrent/metastatic NSCLC. RESULTS Scores of several functional as well as symptom scales in the current NSCLC population differed by more than the MID from the baseline mean scores in the reference EORTC population as well as that reported from other studies. Differences in mean score from the EORTC reference data ranged from 6.2 and 9.4 points for the role functioning and cognitive functioning domains. In the symptom scales, the largest differences were observed for the financial difficulties (23.9) scores for the QLQ-C30 and peripheral neuropathy (21.7) for LC13 questionnaires.

Occasionally, it is necessary to perform an intraoperative gastroscopy to localize the lesion. There are no data in the literature addressing the factors that can predict when a combined laparoscopic-endoscopic approach will be needed. METHODS A retrospective cohort study using a prospectively collected database was conducted. From January 2005 to December 2013, all the patients undergoing a laparoscopic gastric resection for subepithelial tumors irresectable by endoscopy were reviewed. Potential predictive factors for the need of an intraoperative endoscopy were analyzed. RESULTS Thirty-eight consecutive patients (22 men and 16 women) with a mean age of 67 (41-86) years underwent laparoscopic gastric resection for subepithelial tumors. Fourteen (36.8%) patients required intraoperative endoscopic assessment. The only significant factors related to the need of endoscopic assessment during surgery were tumor growth pattern (P = 0.002) and size (P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS An accurate description of tumor growth pattern and size by EUS is recommended in the preoperative assessment of gastric subepithelial tumors. Small tumors (≤18 mm) with an intraluminal growth may need a combined endoscopic-assisted laparoscopic management.","Dávila, Jaime Sampson; Momblán, Dulce; Ginès, Àngels; Sánchez-Montes, Cristina; Araujo, Isis; Saavedra-Pérez, David; Lacy, Antonio M; Fernández-Esparrach, Gloria",Surgical endoscopy,201,22

Methods: Adult patients who were diagnosed as viral pneumonia between January 2010 and December 2015 were consecutively included. Data were collected through reviews of electronic medical records. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Results: A total of 1503 patients with viral pneumonia were included with a mean age of 66.0 years and male predominance in 60%. The most common viral pathogen was rhinovirus, followed by influenza virus and parainfluenza virus (PIV). Viral-bacterial co-infection and multiple viral infections were found in 24.5% and 5.2%, respectively. The 30-day mortality was 7.1% in total patients and it was not different according to viral pathogens. However, cancer patients had higher mortality than non-cancer patients for the PIV (12.3% vs. 3.8%, p < .05) and coronavirus (24.4% vs. 3.0%, p < .01) infections. On the multivariate analysis, old age (≥65) (OR 1.66, 95% CI: 1.06-2.60), viral-bacterial co-infection (OR 1.61, 95% CI: 1.05-2.48), malignancy (OR 2.26, 95% CI: 1.50-3.40), and shock at the initial presentation (OR 2.12, 95% CI: 1.03-4.37) were significantly associated with mortality. Conclusions: The mortality from viral pneumonia was high in adult patients. Old age, viral-bacterial co-infection, underlying malignancy, and initial shock were independent predictors of mortality.","Kim, Youn-Jung; Lee, Eu Sun; Lee, Yoon-Seon",Infectious diseases,201,1

We now describe major developments in recent months and provide an outlook on the expected consequences. METHODS PubMed literature search, clinical survey. RESULTS To date, the course of the COVID-19 pandemic has been characterised by several new but overall rare ocular manifestations, the ophthalmological shared management of COVID-19 patients on intensive care units, and a significant decrease in case numbers, associated with an increase in case severity and relative proportion of emergencies, as a result of delayed presentation of patients and reduced treatment adherence. With the introduction of hygiene measures and infection control procedures, ophthalmic patient care was maintained - including emergencies and urgent treatments. Due to the extensive postponement of elective surgeries, scarce therapeutic and health care professional resources, and the prioritisation of critically ill patients from other specialties, there is a reasonable likelihood that urgent treatments will be delayed as infection rates rise. CONCLUSION Outpatient and inpatient care in ophthalmology during the COVID-19 pandemic is primarily accompanied by additional organisational or medical challenges and a decline in case volume. Although to date emergency and urgent ophthalmic treatments have been maintained, long-term persistence of pandemic conditions will require additional strategies to provide continuation of ophthalmic care at the required level.","Hattenbach, Lars-Olof; Feltgen, Nicolas; Eter, Nicole; Al-Nawaiseh, Sami; Chronopoulos, Argyrios",Klinische Monatsblatter fur Augenheilkunde,201,27

As new systems are introduced, the incidence of acute renal artery wall injury with relation to the denervation method is unknown. We investigated the acute repercussion of renal denervation on the renal arteries of patients treated with balloon-based and nonballoon-based denervation systems by quantitative angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). METHODS AND RESULTS Twenty-five patients (50 renal arteries) underwent bilateral renal denervation with 5 different systems, 3 of which balloon-based (Paradise [n=5], Oneshot [n=6], and Vessix V2 [n=5)]) and 2 nonballoon-based (Symplicity [n=6] and EnligHTN [n=3]). Analysis included quantitative angiography and morphometric intravascular ultrasound measurements pre and post procedure and assessment of vascular trauma (dissection, edema, or thrombus) by OCT after denervation. A significant reduction in lumen size by quantitative angiography and intravascular ultrasound was observed in nonballoon denervation but not in balloon denervation. By postdenervation OCT, dissection was seen in 14 arteries (32.6%). The percentage of frames with dissection was higher in balloon-based denervation catheters. Thrombus and edema were detected in 35 (81.4%) and 32 (74.4%) arteries, respectively. In arteries treated with balloon-based denervation that had dissection by OCT, the balloon/artery ratio was higher (1.24 [1.17-1.32] versus 1.10 [1.04-1.18]; P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS A varying extent of vascular injury was observed after renal denervation in all systems; however, different patterns were identified in balloon-based and in nonballoon-based denervation systems. In balloon denervation, the presence of dissections by OCT was associated with a higher balloon/artery ratio.","Karanasos, Antonios; Van Mieghem, Nicolas; Bergmann, Martin W; Hartman, Eline; Ligthart, Jurgen; van der Heide, Elco; Heeger, Christian-H; Ouhlous, Mohamed; Zijlstra, Felix; Regar, Evelyn; Daemen, Joost",Circulation.

Pneumonia is broadly divided into community-acquired pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia. A large variety of microorganisms can cause pneumonia, including bacteria, respiratory viruses and fungi, and there are great geographical variations in their prevalence. Pneumonia occurs more commonly in susceptible individuals, including children of <5 years of age and older adults with prior chronic conditions. Development of the disease largely depends on the host immune response, with pathogen characteristics having a less prominent role. Individuals with pneumonia often present with respiratory and systemic symptoms, and diagnosis is based on both clinical presentation and radiological findings. It is crucial to identify the causative pathogens, as delayed and inadequate antimicrobial therapy can lead to poor outcomes. New antibiotic and non-antibiotic therapies, in addition to rapid and accurate diagnostic tests that can detect pathogens and antibiotic resistance will improve the management of pneumonia.","Torres, Antoni; Cilloniz, Catia; Niederman, Michael S; Menéndez, Rosario; Chalmers, James D; Wunderink, Richard G; van der Poll, Tom",Nature reviews.

METHODS We conducted prospective, population-based surveillance for acute respiratory illness or fever among inpatient and outpatient children less than 5 years of age in three U.S. counties from 2003 through 2009. Clinical and demographic data were obtained from parents and medical records, HMPV was detected by means of a reverse-transcriptase polymerase-chain-reaction assay, and population-based rates of hospitalization and estimated rates of outpatient visits associated with HMPV infection were determined. RESULTS HMPV was detected in 200 of 3490 hospitalized children (6%), 222 of 3257 children in outpatient clinics (7%), 224 of 3001 children in the emergency department (7%), and 10 of 770 asymptomatic controls (1%). Overall annual rates of hospitalization associated with HMPV infection were 1 per 1000 children less than 5 years of age, 3 per 1000 infants less than 6 months of age, and 2 per 1000 children 6 to 11 months of age. Children hospitalized with HMPV infection, as compared with those hospitalized without HMPV infection, were older and more likely to receive a diagnosis of pneumonia or asthma, to require supplemental oxygen, and to have a longer stay in the intensive care unit. The estimated annual burden of outpatient visits associated with HMPV infection was 55 clinic visits and 13 emergency department visits per 1000 children. The majority of HMPV-positive inpatient and outpatient children had no underlying medical conditions, although premature birth and asthma were more frequent among hospitalized children with HMPV infection than among those without HMPV infection. CONCLUSIONS HMPV infection is associated with a substantial burden of hospitalizations and outpatient visits among children throughout the first 5 years of life, especially during the first year. Most children with HMPV infection were previously healthy.

Further development of training and education for healthcare teams requires a more complete understanding of team performance in stressful situations. We wanted to learn from others, by looking beyond the field of medicine, aiming to learn about a) sources of stress, b) effects of stress on team performance and c) concepts on dealing with stress. METHODS A scoping literature review was undertaken. The three largest interdisciplinary databases outside of healthcare, Scopus, Web of Science and PsycINFO, were searched for articles published in English between 2008 and 2020. Eligible articles focused on team performance in stressful situations with outcome measures at a team level. Studies were selected, and data were extracted and analysed by at least two researchers. RESULTS In total, 15 articles were included in the review (4 non-comparative, 6 multi- or mixed methods, 5 experimental studies). Three sources of stress were identified: performance pressure, role pressure and time pressure. Potential effects of stress on the team were: a narrow focus on task execution, unclear responsibilities within the team and diminished understanding of the situation. Communication, shared knowledge and situational awareness were identified as potentially helpful team processes. Cross training was suggested as a promising intervention to develop a shared mental model within a team. CONCLUSION Stress can have a significant impact on team performance. Developing strategies to prevent and manage stress and its impact has the potential to significantly increase performance of teams in stressful situations. Further research into the development and use of team cognition in stress in healthcare teams is needed, in order to be able to integrate this 'team brain' in training and education with the specific goal of preparing professionals for team performance in stressful situations.","Dijkstra, Femke S; Renden, Peter G; Meeter, Martijn; Schoonmade, Linda J; Krage, Ralf; van Schuppen, Hans; de la Croix, Anne","Scandinavian journal of trauma, resuscitation and emergency medicine",201,19

Uncontrolled inflammatory host responses contribute to the unfavorable outcome by driving lung and extrapulmonary organ failure. The complement fragment C5a holds significant proinflammatory functions and is associated with tissue damage in various inflammatory conditions. The authors hypothesized that C5a concentrations are increased in pneumonia and C5a neutralization promotes barrier stabilization in the lung and is protective in pneumococcal pulmonary sepsis. METHODS The authors investigated regulation of C5a in pneumonia in a prospective patient cohort and in experimental pneumonia. Two complementary models of murine pneumococcal pneumonia were applied. Female mice were treated with NOX-D19, a C5a-neutralizing L-RNA-aptamer. Lung, liver, and kidney injury and the inflammatory response were assessed by measuring pulmonary permeability (primary outcome), pulmonary and blood leukocytes, cytokine concentrations in lung and blood, and bacterial load in lung, spleen, and blood, and performing histologic analyses of tissue damage, apoptosis, and fibrin deposition (n = 5 to 13). RESULTS In hospitalized patients with pneumonia (n = 395), higher serum C5a concentrations were observed compared to healthy subjects (n = 24; 6.3 nmol/l [3.9 to 10.0] vs. 4.5 nmol/l [3.8 to 6.6], median [25 to 75% interquartile range]; difference: 1.4 [95% CI, 0.1 to 2.9]; P = 0.029). Neutralization of C5a in mice resulted in lower pulmonary permeability in pneumococcal pneumonia (1.38 ± 0.89 vs. 3.29 ± 2.34, mean ± SD; difference: 1.90 [95% CI, 0.15 to 3.66]; P = 0.035; n = 10 or 11) or combined severe pneumonia and mechanical ventilation (2.56 ± 1.17 vs. 7.31 ± 5.22; difference: 4.76 [95% CI, 1.22 to 8.30]; P = 0.011; n = 9 or 10). Further, C5a neutralization led to lower blood granulocyte colony-stimulating factor concentrations and protected against sepsis-associated liver injury. CONCLUSIONS Systemic C5a is elevated in pneumonia patients. Neutralizing C5a protected against lung and liver injury in pneumococcal pneumonia in mice. Early neutralization of C5a might be a promising adjunctive treatment strategy to improve outcome in community-acquired pneumonia. : WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THIS TOPIC: Pneumonia, sepsis, and immune dysregulation cause morbidity and mortalityC5a is a component of the complement system and a proinflammatory mediator that modulates the innate immune response in critical illnessDisruption of the C5a receptor axis with antibodies or antagonists was previously protective in various animal sepsis models WHAT THIS ARTICLE TELLS US THAT IS NEW: In hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia, serum C5a concentrations were 1.4-fold higher compared to healthy subjectsIn two mouse models of pneumonia and sepsis, NOX-D19, a C5a-neutralizing L-RNA aptamer, caused lower pulmonary hyperpermeability and sepsis-related acute liver injury.","Müller-Redetzky, Holger; Kellermann, Ute; Wienhold, Sandra-Maria; Gutbier, Birgitt; Lienau, Jasmin; Hellwig, Katharina; Reppe, Katrin; Letsiou, Eleftheria; Tschernig, Thomas; Scholz, Markus; Ahnert, Peter; Maasch, Christian; Hoehlig, Kai; Klussmann, Sven; Vater, Axel; Firsching, Theresa C; Hoppe, Judith; Suttorp, Norbert; Witzenrath, Martin",Anesthesiology,201,31

METHODS From November 2009 to April 2010, 16 patients operated on for genital prolapse of grade greater than or equal to 2 (POP-Q classification) were evaluated prospectively by three questionnaires of quality of life Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20), Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire (PFIQ-7) and Pelvic Organ Prolaps/Urinary Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12). Data were collected the day before surgery and 6 weeks postoperatively. RESULTS Eleven patients had laparoscopic surgery and five vaginal surgery. There was a significant decrease in pelvic heaviness, vaginal discomfort and urinary symptoms after surgery. The score of symptoms of prolapse, the PFDI-20 score was 98.5 preoperatively and 31.8 postoperatively (p < 0.0001). The score for quality of life, the PFIQ-7 score was 54.5 preoperatively and 7.4 postoperatively (p = 0.001). The score of sexuality, the PISQ-12 score was 35.3 preoperatively and 37.5 postoperatively (p = 0.1). Two of the 3 patients with a PFIQ 7 under or equal to 20 were not improved while all the women with a preoperative PFIQ-7 over 20 were improved after surgery. CONCLUSIONS This study suggests that surgery improves quality of life of patients with genital prolapse. Quality of life questionnaires could help select good candidates for surgery.

Hair loss treatment involves both surgical intervention and nonsurgical therapies such as pharmaceuticals, haircare products, vitamins, and low-level laser therapy (LLLT). While pharmaceuticals have been extensively researched, the efficacy of other therapies remains inconclusive. With so many available treatments, consumers often research their options using search engines such as Google and/or seek help from hair restoration physicians. AIMS To identify and analyze changing trends in international consumer and physician interest in nonsurgical hair loss therapies. METHODS Worldwide trends in Google searches of hair loss products (2004-2020) were compared with product prescription frequency surveys from members of the International Society of Hair Restoration Surgery (2004-2019, ~29% response rate). RESULTS Minoxidil and finasteride were the most prescribed hair loss treatments, while ""minoxidil"" was the most ""Googled"" term. Generic products were searched more often than their brand counterparts. Nutritionals and haircare prescriptions increased over time. LLLT was also increasingly prescribed, with Internet searches increasing following government regulation announcements. The COVID-19 pandemic initially negatively affected hair loss treatment searches, which have since returned to, and surpassed, pre-pandemic levels. CONCLUSION Regulations and social media have influence on consumer interest in hair loss products. A weak economy and coronavirus fears may persuade consumers to turn to cheaper hair loss treatment alternatives. Hair restoration specialists need to keep abreast of online trends to communicate effectively with their patients.

However, certain types of mesh may be less amenable to removal even in the setting of active infection; we present four such cases, all involving the same composite mesh. METHODS Four high-risk patients underwent Parietex mesh implantation for large ventral wall hernias and developed subsequent Staphylococcus infections with attempted explantation of infected mesh and wound care. RESULTS There was inability to completely explant mesh in all four cases, leading to chronic purulent wounds and long-term complications. CONCLUSION While mesh infection is a recognized complication of prosthetic hernia repair, many synthetic meshes form a slimy biofilm and thus can be removed relatively easily. However, the structural qualities of certain types of mesh create ingrowth into tissues even in the setting of infection, resulting in inability to explant with subsequent long-term chronic wound complications.","Hanna, M; Dissanaike, S",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,201,31

In response to Hooper's book, The River (1999), the Royal Society in London held a conference to debate the origins of HIV. Examination of the quick dismissal of the OPV theory opens a space for legitimately challenging the widely held belief that the vaccine contamination question was convincingly resolved. This article interrogates the relationship between historiography and the making of scientific facts and history, suggesting that historians have been too credulous of scientists' testimony. The further result of the lack of a thorough analysis of the evidence backing the OPV hypothesis has resulted in a missed opportunity to read The River as one of the few detailed accounts of the immense social, political, technological, and interspecies infrastructure constituted by Cold War vaccine production. This biomedical infrastructure dramatically changed the geographic and interspecies mobility of viruses in ways that may be impossible to reconstruct. Yet these potential transmission routes remain crucial to acknowledge.

METHODS Using the original derivation cohort of 1,983 patients from a combined database of randomized clinical trials (NINDS [National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke] 1 and 2; ATLANTIS [Alteplase Thrombolysis for Acute Noninterventional Therapy in Ischemic Stroke] A and B; and ECASS [European Cooperative Acute Stroke Study] II), we simplified the Stroke-TPI by reducing variables and interaction terms and by exploring simpler (3- and 8-item) stroke severity scores. External validation was performed in the ECASS III trial (n = 821). RESULTS The following 6 variables were most predictive of good outcomes: age, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, stroke severity, symptom onset to treatment time, and rtPA therapy. Treatment effect modifiers included onset to treatment time and systolic blood pressure. For the models predicting a bad outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] score ≥5), significant variables included age, stroke severity, and serum glucose. rtPA therapy did not change the risk of a poor outcome. Compared with models using the full NIH Stroke Scale, models using the 3-item severity score showed similar discrimination and excellent calibration. External validation on ECASS III showed similar performance (C statistics 0.75 [mRS score ≤1] and 0.80 [mRS score ≤2]). CONCLUSION A simpler model using a 3-item stroke severity score, instead of the 15-item NIH Stroke Scale, has similar prognostic value and may be easier to use in routine care. Future studies are needed to test whether it can improve process and clinical outcomes.","Kent, David M; Ruthazer, Robin; Decker, Carole; Jones, Philip G; Saver, Jeffrey L; Bluhmki, Erich; Spertus, John A",Neurology,201,23

In this study, prognostic risk factors for ICU admission among COVID-19 hospitalized patients were evaluated. Methods From 22 February to April 20, 2020. A total of 214 COVID-19 patients participated in this study. The included patients were between 18- 80 years old, and the patients who previously admitted for COVID-19 were excluded. The comorbid medical conditions, admission laboratory, demographic data, and first manifestations were analyzed between two groups, including ICU and non-ICU admitted patients. The statistical analysis, univariate and multivariate analysis were afforded. The value of the predictors in the risk assessment of ICU admission was estimated. Results 55(25.7%) patients were admitted in ICU. The ICU admitted patient's mortality rate was about 68%. The age was significantly higher among ICU admission group (P=0.03). Admission O2 saturation was significantly lower among ICU admitted patients (P=0.00). The kidney disease and malignancy history were more frequent in ICU-admitted patients (P=0.04, P=0.00). Myalgia was the clinical manifestation that significantly presented more frequent in ICU-admitted patients. INR, CRP, ESR, HB, and lymphocyte were significantly different between two groups. After multivariable analysis, admission O2 saturation, hematocrit, CRP and myalgia could significantly predict the risk of ICU admission. Furthermore, the value of predictors was estimated in our study. Conclusion Based on our results, the admission O2 saturation, HCT, CRP levels at first admission and myalgia presentation could be considered as the valuable predictors of ICU admission.","Sadeghi, Amir; Eslami, Pegah; Dooghaie Moghadam, Arash; Pirsalehi, Ali; Shojaee, Sajad; Vahidi, Mohammad; Soheili, Amirali; Ghanimat, Faezeh; Keshmiri, Yasaman; Abdi, Saeed; Zali, Mohammad Reza",Caspian journal of internal medicine,201,4

The most common mutation, F508del, leads to almost total absence of CFTR at the plasma membrane, a defect potentially corrected via drug-based therapies. Herein, we report the first proof-of-principle study of a noninvasive imaging probe able to detect CFTR at the plasma membrane. We radiolabeled the CFTR inhibitor, CFTRinh -172a, with technetium-99m via a pyrazolyl-diamine chelating unit, yielding a novel 99m Tc(CO)3 complex. A non-radioactive surrogate showed that the structural modifications introduced in the inhibitor did not affect its activity. The radioactive complex was able to detect plasma membrane CFTR, shown by its significantly higher uptake in wild-type versus mutated cells. Furthermore, assessment of F508del CFTR pharmacological correction in human cells using the radioactive complex revealed differences in corrector versus control uptake, recapitulating the biochemical correction observed for the protein.","Ferreira, Vera F C; Oliveira, Bruno L; Santos, João D; Correia, João D G; Farinha, Carlos M; Mendes, Filipa",ChemMedChem,201,14

Children aged less than 18 years who were hospitalized with LRTIs were enrolled from January 2013 to December 2015. Respiratory specimens were collected for the detection of common respiratory viruses, atypical bacteria, and other bacteria using current laboratory diagnostic tests. The epidemiological characteristics of the respiratory pathogens were analyzed. Of the 10,123 specimens obtained from the patients, 5,966 (58.7%) were positive for at least 1 pathogen. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (M.pneumoniae) was the most commonly detected pathogen (15.7%), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (13.9%). Co-infections were found in 11.4% of patients. Of these co-infections, viral-bacterial co-infections were the most common. The detection rates for the respiratory pathogens varied considerably by age. RSV was the most common pathogen in children aged less than 24 months. Clear seasonal peaks were observed for RSV, M. pneumoniae, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenza infections.

This prospective randomized controlled trial compared the effectiveness and safety of single-port and multi-port laparoscopic LLLS for the surgical treatment of benign liver disease. METHODS Altogether, 38 patients aged 17-65 years (16 men, 22 women) with benign liver diseases were hospitalized for elective laparoscopic LLLS between January 2010 and December 2012. Patients were randomly assigned to either single-port (n = 19) or multi-port (n = 19) laparoscopic LLLS. Main outcome measures were operative time, volume of intraoperative blood loss, complication rates, and postoperative hospitalization. RESULTS Baseline characteristics of the two groups were comparable. Single-port and multi-port laparoscopies were successfully completed in all but one patient (1/19, 5.3 %) who required conversion from a single-port to a multi-port procedure. The two groups had similar mean operative times and volumes of intraoperative blood loss. There were no clinically significant postoperative complications or deaths. The single-port group had a significantly shorter postoperative hospitalization than the multi-port group (2.5 ± 1.7 vs. 4.0 ± 2.1 days; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS Single-port laparoscopic LLLS is a technically feasible, effective, safe alternative to multi-port laparoscopy for the treatment of benign liver diseases in cautiously selected patients.","Hu, Minggen; Zhao, Guodong; Wang, Fei; Xu, Dabin; Liu, Rong",World journal of surgery,201,23

Recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after liver transplantation (LT) indicates a poor prognosis. Surgery is considered the only curative option for selected patients with HCC recurrence following LT. Traditionally, the preference is given to the open approach. Methods. In this report, we present two cases of laparoscopic resections (LR) for recurrent HCC after LT, performed at Oslo University Hospital, Rikshospitalet. Results. Both procedures were executed without intraoperative and postoperative adverse events. Whereas one of the patients had a recurrence one year after LR, the other patient did not have any sign of disease during 3-year follow-up. Conclusions. We argue that, in selected cases, patients with HCC recurrence following LT may benefit from LR due to its limited tissue trauma and timely start of subsequent treatment if curative resection cannot be obtained. In patients with relatively favorable prognosis, LR facilitates postoperative recovery course and avoids unnecessary laparotomy.","Sahakyan, Mushegh A; Kazaryan, Airazat M; Pomianowska, Ewa; Abildgaard, Andreas; Line, Pål-Dag; Bjørnbeth, Bjørn Atle; Edwin, Bjørn; Røsok, Bård Ingvald",Case reports in oncological medicine,201,31

While the imbalanced innate immune response of end-stage COVID-19 has been extensively studied, the earliest stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection at the mucosal entry site have remained unexplored. Here we employed SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus infection in native multi-cell-type human nasal turbinate and lung tissues ex vivo, coupled with genome-wide transcriptional analysis, to investigate viral susceptibility and early patterns of local-mucosal innate immune response in the authentic milieu of the human respiratory tract. SARS-CoV-2 productively infected the nasal turbinate tissues, predominantly targeting respiratory epithelial cells, with rapid increase in tissue-associated viral sub-genomic mRNA, and secretion of infectious viral progeny. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 infection triggered robust antiviral and inflammatory innate immune responses in the nasal mucosa. The upregulation of interferon stimulated genes, cytokines and chemokines, related to interferon signaling and immune-cell activation pathways, was broader than that triggered by influenza virus infection. Conversely, lung tissues exhibited a restricted innate immune response to SARS-CoV-2, with a conspicuous lack of type I and III interferon upregulation, contrasting with their vigorous innate immune response to influenza virus. Our findings reveal differential tissue-specific innate immune responses in the upper and lower respiratory tract, that are distinct to SARS-CoV-2. The studies shed light on the role of the nasal-mucosa in active viral transmission and immune defense, implying a window of opportunity for early interventions, whereas the restricted innate immune response in early-SARS-CoV-2-infected lung tissues could underlie the unique uncontrolled late-phase lung damage of advanced COVID-19.IMPORTANCEIn order to reduce the late-phase morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, there is a need to better understand and target the earliest stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the human respiratory tract. Here we have studied the initial steps of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the consequent innate immune responses within the natural multicellular complexity of human nasal-mucosal and lung tissues. Comparing the global innate response patterns of nasal and lung tissues, infected in parallel with SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus, we have revealed distinct virus-host interactions in the upper and lower respiratory tract, which could determine the outcome and unique pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies in the nasal-mucosal infection model can be employed to assess the impact of viral evolutionary changes, and evaluate new therapeutic and preventive measures against SARS-CoV-2 and other human respiratory pathogens.","Alfi, Or; Yakirevitch, Arkadi; Wald, Ori; Wandel, Ori; Izhar, Uzi; Oiknine-Djian, Esther; Nevo, Yuval; Elgavish, Sharona; Dagan, Elad; Madgar, Ory; Feinmesser, Gilad; Pikarsky, Eli; Bronstein, Michal; Vorontsov, Olesya; Jonas, Wayne; Ives, John; Walter, Joan; Zakay-Rones, Zichria; Oberbaum, Menachem; Panet, Amos; Wolf, Dana G",Journal of virology,201,33

To determine whether these HCMV envelope proteins could elicit neutralizing activities synergistically, we immunized rabbits with individual or various combinations of these proteins adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide mixed with CpG-ODN. We then analyzed serum neutralizing activities with multiple HCMV laboratory strains and clinical isolates. HCMV trimeric gB and gH/gL elicited high and moderate titers of HCMV neutralizing activity, respectively. HCMV gB in combination with gH/gL elicited up to 17-fold higher HCMV neutralizing activities compared to the sum of neutralizing activity elicited by the individual proteins analyzed with both fibroblasts and epithelial cells. HCMV gB+gH/gL+UL128/UL130/UL131A in combination increased the neutralizing activity up to 32-fold compared to the sum of neutralizing activities elicited by the individual proteins analyzed with epithelial cells. Adding UL128/UL130/UL131A to gB and gH/gL combination did not increase further the HCMV neutralizing activity analyzed with fibroblasts. These data suggest that the combination of HCMV core fusion machinery envelope proteins gB+gH/gL or the combination of gB and pentameric complex could be ideal vaccine candidates that would induce optimal immune responses against HCMV infection.","Cui, Xinle; Cao, Zhouhong; Wang, Shuishu; Adler, Stuart P; McVoy, Michael A; Snapper, Clifford M",Vaccines,201,1

We systematically reviewed the literature to identify (1) how human factors affect ward care escalation (2) gaps in the current literature and (3) critique literature methodologies. METHODS We undertook a Qualitative Evidence Synthesis of care escalation studies. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINHAL from inception to September 2019. We used the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment-Development and Evaluation and Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research tool to assess study quality. RESULTS Our search identified 24 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. Confidence in findings was moderate (20 studies) to high (4 studies). In 16 studies, the ability to recognise changes in the patient's condition (soft signals), including skin colour/temperature, respiratory pattern, blood loss, personality change, patient complaint and fatigue, improved the ability to escalate patients. Soft signals were detected through patient assessment (looking/listening/feeling) and not Early Warning Scores (eight studies). In contrast, 13 studies found a high workload and low staffing levels reduced staff's ability to detect patient deterioration and escalate care. In eight studies quantifiable deterioration evidence (Early Warning Scores) facilitated escalation communication, particularly when referrer/referee were unfamiliar. Conversely, escalating concerning non-triggering patients was challenging but achieved by some clinical staff (three studies). Team decision making facilitated the clinical escalation (six studies). CONCLUSIONS Early Warning Scores have clinical benefits but can sometimes impede escalation in patients not meeting the threshold. Staff use other factors (soft signals) not captured in Early Warning Scores to escalate care. The literature supports strategies that improve the escalation process such as good patient assessment skills.

Family-related factors are considered important determinants of children's suicidal ideation, whereas their short-/long-term influence is seldom quantified. AIMS We aim to confirm the simultaneous/lagged effects of family-related factors on the occurrence of recent suicidal ideation from childhood to young adulthood (aged from 10 to 22 years old). METHOD Data were derived from a longitudinal prospective cohort study. Participants included 2065 students who were followed up for 13 years. Generalized estimating equations were used to clarify the influential effects of family-related factors on suicidal ideation during the past month. RESULTS The peak of the rate of recent suicidal ideation arrived during junior high school years. Family interaction, family support, family involvement, and parental punishment had simultaneous effects on recent suicidal ideation. Family involvement, parental conflict, and psychological control had lagged and lasting effects on suicidal ideation. Notably, the lasting protective effects of family involvement were more obvious than simultaneous effects.

The strict containment measures have adversely affected population movements and mobility, daily activities, and the patterns of healthcare-seeking behavior. Although the Emergency and Admission Departments (EADS) activity has never been disrupted, the pandemic had a significant impact on the routine healthcare delivery. This study aims to assess the changes in healthcare delivery, with a focus on the elderly as a vulnerable component of the general population. Design of the study Retrospective study. Methods All non-COVID visits to the EAD of the Local Health Unit (ASL1) in Abruzzo (Italy) from 9 March to 3 May 2020 were analyzed. These were compared to the hospital admissions recorded in the same period of the previous year. Results We found a 60.4% reduction in overall visits during the study period and an increase in the hospitalization rate from 30% to 39%. Emergency department visits have declined markedly for less acute medical conditions, while we have observed a statistically significant increase in the hospitalization rates for all age groups. Moreover, in 2020 we recorded a decrease in the ratio non-urgent/non-deferrable medical conditions for each age group; while the percentage of hospitalizations for each registered red code increased for each group, particularly for the 65-74 age group. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the care-seeking behavior of patients. During the COVID-19 epidemic, total hospital admissions have decreased, particularly for less severe illnesses, whereas the percentage of hospitalizations has increased. During 2020, hospital admissions for mild cases decreased, and patients presented to the EAD only in cases of acute medical condition, selecting those in need for more intensive care. However, several patients may have deferred necessary medical care even for potentially urgent conditions. Such reluctance to seek medical care may have caused delays in diagnosis. The impact of deferred care on patients' health is difficult to estimate at this time. This information will serve as a starting point for further research to improve healthcare management not only during emergency but also in non-emergency periods.","Muselli, M; Cofini, V; Mammarella, L; Carmignani, C; Fabiani, L; Desideri, G; Necozione, S",Annali di igiene : medicina preventiva e di comunita,201,24

Saliva samples were obtained within the first 72 hours of life in a maternity ward in Madrid (Spain), during a 1-year period. All positive screening tests were confirmed with viral load in urine. Clinical, laboratory, auditory, visual and cerebral imaging assessments were performed in all children with cCMV. RESULTS Of the 4097 neonates born during the study period, 3190 (78%) were included. CMV viral load in saliva was detectable in 24/3190 (0.75%) children, and congenital infection was confirmed in 15/3190 (0.47%, CI 95%: 0.29%-0.77%). Positive predictive value was 62.5% (CI 95%: 46.5%-76.1%). Two infants presented symptoms at birth. Eight (53.3%) children showed abnormalities in magnetic resonance imaging; most of them isolated white matter abnormalities. Newborns with abnormalities in magnetic resonance imaging showed higher viral loads in blood and saliva (P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS One in 200 neonates born in our hospital presented a cCMV infection. CMV viral load in saliva has been shown to be a simple and highly accepted screening method but should be confirmed by CMV detection in urine. In spite of the fact that half of infected children had abnormalities in cerebral imaging, diagnosis during the neonatal period would have been impossible without a screening program in most cases.","Blázquez-Gamero, Daniel; Soriano-Ramos, María; Vicente, Marta; Pallás-Alonso, Carmen Rosa; Pérez-Rivilla, Alfredo; García-Álvarez, Mónica; Pinilla Martín, María Teresa; Freire, Xavier; De Vergas, Joaquín; De Aragón, Ana Martínez; Zamora, Berta; Epalza, Cristina; Moraleda, Cinta; Rojo, Pablo; Prieto, Luis; Fernández-Cooke, Elisa; Ruíz-Contreras, Jesús; Delgado, Rafael; Folgueira, María Dolores",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,201,6

These strains, isolated from faeces of animals living in captivity at the zoological garden of Lille (France), are Escherichia coli ICVB443, Enterococcus faecalis ICVB501 and Pediococcus pentosaceus ICVB491. Their genomes have been analysed and compared to those of their pathogenic or probiotic counterparts. The genome analyses of E. coli ICVB443 and Ent. faecalis ICVB501 displayed similarities to those of probiotics E. coli 1917 Nissle, and Ent. faecalis Symbioflor 1, respectively. Furthermore, E. coli ICVB443 shares at least 89 genes with the enteroaggregative E. coli 55989 (EAEC), and Ent. faecalis ICVB501 shares at least 315 genes with the pathogenic Ent. faecalis V583 strain. Unlike Ped. pentosaceus ICVB491, which is devoid of virulence genes, E. coli ICVB443 and Ent. faecalis ICVB501 both carry genes encoding virulence factors on their genomes. Of note, the bioinformatics analysis of these two genomes located the bsh gene, which codes for bile salt hydrolase (BSH). The presence of BSH is of major importance, as it can help to increase the viability of these two strains in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT). The genome analysis of Ped. pentosaceus ICVB491 confirmed its GRAS status (Generally Recognised As Safe), as no genomic virulence factor determinant was found.","Eveno, Mégane; Belguesmia, Yanath; Bazinet, Laurent; Gancel, Frédérique; Fliss, Ismail; Drider, Djamel",Archives of microbiology,201,16

Scalp and forehead reconstruction in these circumstances are safest when performed under local anesthesia, maintaining cervical immobilization. Case Description A sizeable 10 × 6.5 cm forehead defect was reconstructed utilizing regenerative principles under local anesthesia and sedation in a 54-year-old woman. After adequate debridement of gangrenous soft tissues, exposed outer skull bones were trephined, forehead defect covered with a synthetic biomaterial, and the patient was discharged thereafter. Granulating neodermis regenerated within the biomaterial over the next 6 weeks. Weekly platelet-rich plasma injections along the wound margins facilitated wound regeneration. Dimensions reduced by two-thirds to 6.5 × 3.5 cm with wound regeneration and contraction, while granulating neodermis covered the remaining skull-bones. Split skin-grafting over the neodermis ensured satisfying long-term results, with similar color, texture, soft-tissue thickness, and sensation. Multiple occipitocervical, spinal, scapular, and rib fractures healed well with strict immobilization. Conclusion Good long-term results were achieved with significantly reduced dangers, complications, hospitalization, and costs than traditional reconstructive flap surgeries. Minimalistic reconstruction utilizing tissue engineering and regenerative medicine principles appears beneficial for patients with grave spinal injuries.","Saha, Srinjoy",Surgical neurology international,201,31

In Australia, bodies for anatomy education are acquired only through donations. To gain insight into educational dynamics in an anatomy laboratory as well as to facilitate body donation programs and thanksgiving ceremonies, it is important to understand students' attitudes toward body donation. In this cross-sectional study, the attitudes of Macquarie University's first, second, and fifth year chiropractic students toward body donation were investigated. Macquarie University chiropractic students have a four semester long anatomy program, which includes cadaver-based instruction on prosected specimens. A questionnaire was used to record respondents' demographics and attitudes toward body donation: personal, by a relative, and by a stranger. It was found that ethnicity and religion affect attitudes toward body donation, with Australian students being more willing to donate a stranger's body and atheists and agnostics being more willing to donate in general. Furthermore, willingness to donate one's own or a family member's body decreases as year of study increases, suggesting a possible negative impact of exposure to cadavers in the anatomy laboratory. This was only true, however, after controlling for age. Thus, the impact of viewing and handling prosected specimens, which is the norm in anatomy classes in Australia, may not be as strong as dissecting cadavers. It is suggested that anatomists and educators prepare students for cadaver-based instruction as well as exhibit sensitivity to cultural differences in how students approach working with cadavers, when informing different communities about body donation programs and in devising thanksgiving ceremonies.","Alexander, Michelle; Marten, Mathew; Stewart, Ella; Serafin, Stanley; Štrkalj, Goran",Anatomical sciences education,201,23
96235,96235,96235,COVID-19: Mobilizing Quickly for a Rapid Response.,19.92523,8.6773,2020-09-15,"BACKGROUND Many in vitro models report higher inhaled dose with dry versus heated humidity. Heat-and-moisture exchangers (HMEs) provide passive humidity in ventilator-dependent patients but act as a barrier to aerosol. The HMEs designed to allow aerosol delivery (HME-ADs) have not been well described. The purpose of this study is to determine the impact on aerosol deposition of HME-ADs with and without active exhaled humidity in a simulated ventilator-dependent adult model. METHODS We used an in vitro lung model consisting of an intubated teaching mannequin with an endotracheal tube of 8.0 mm inner diameter with bronchi directly attached to a collecting filter and passive rubber test lung to provide testing without active exhaled humidity. To simulate exhaled humidity, a Cascade humidifier (37°C and 100% relative humidity) was placed between the collecting filter and test lung, simulating body temperature and pressure saturated exhaled humidity at the bronchi. Albuterol sulfate (2.5 mg/3 mL) was administered with a mesh nebulizer (Aerogen Solo) placed in the inspiratory limb of the ventilator circuit at the Y-piece, with no HME in place (control) and with 3 HME-AD devices, including the CircuVent, Humid-Flo, and AirLife, with and without exhaled humidity. Drug was eluted from the collecting filter and analyzed with spectrophotometry. Student t tests and analysis of variance were used for data analysis (P < .05). RESULTS The percentage of drug dose delivered (mean ± SD) distal to the bronchi in the control experiments was greater than all of the HME-ADs without exhaled humidity 18 ± 0.7 and with active exhaled humidity 10.8 ± 0.2% (P < .005). Without exhaled humidity, aerosol delivery with the CircuVent (12.6 ± 0.8), Humid-Flo (15.3 ± 0.8), and AirLife (12.0 ± 0.5) was less than control (P < .001, P = .01 and P < .001, respectively). In contrast, with exhaled humidity, no difference was found between control and HME-ADs (P = .89). Also, a greater variation between control and the 3 HME-ADs was observed without exhaled humidity. Drug delivery without exhaled humidity exceeded aerosol deposition obtained with exhaled humidity in all conditions tested in this study. CONCLUSIONS In this model simulating active exhaled humidity, aerosol drug delivery was lower and more consistent with both control and the HME-ADs than with the standard nonhumidified model. Further studies are needed to determine whether greater deposition in a dry model is an artifact of the model that does not simulate exhaled humidity.","Ari, Arzu; Alwadeai, Khalid S; Fink, James B",Respiratory care,201,32

97880,97880,97880,Influence of Renin-Angiotensin System Inhibitors on Lower-Respiratory Tract Infections in Type 2 Diabetes: The Fremantle Diabetes Study Phase II.,20.168905,8.523175,2020-07-02,"UNLABELLED The expression of the antiviral host cell factor tetherin is induced by interferon and can inhibit the release of enveloped viruses from infected cells. The Vpu protein of HIV-1 antagonizes the antiviral activity of tetherin, and tetherin antagonists with Vpu-like activity have been identified in other viruses. In contrast, it is incompletely understood whether tetherin inhibits influenza A virus (FLUAV) release and whether FLUAV encodes tetherin antagonists. Here, we show that release of several laboratory-adapted FLUAV strains and a seasonal FLUAV strain is inhibited by tetherin, while pandemic FLUAV A/Hamburg/4/2009 is resistant. Studies with a virus-like particle system and analysis of reassortant viruses provided evidence that the viral hemagglutinin (HA) is an important determinant of tetherin antagonism but requires the presence of its cognate neuraminidase (NA) to inhibit tetherin. Finally, tetherin antagonism by FLUAV was dependent on the virion context, since retrovirus release from tetherin-positive cells was not rescued, and correlated with an HA- and NA-dependent reduction in tetherin expression. In sum, our study identifies HA and NA proteins of certain pandemic FLUAV as tetherin antagonists, which has important implications for understanding FLUAV pathogenesis. IMPORTANCE Influenza A virus (FLUAV) infection is responsible for substantial global morbidity and mortality, and understanding how the virus evades the immune defenses of the host may uncover novel targets for antiviral intervention. Tetherin is an antiviral effector molecule of the innate immune system which can contribute to control of viral invasion. However, it has been unclear whether FLUAV is inhibited by tetherin and whether these viruses encode tetherin-antagonizing proteins. Our observation that several pandemic FLUAV strains can counteract tetherin via their HA and NA proteins identifies these proteins as novel tetherin antagonists and indicates that HA/NA-dependent inactivation of innate defenses may contribute to the efficient spread of pandemic FLUAV.","Gnirß, Kerstin; Zmora, Pawel; Blazejewska, Paulina; Winkler, Michael; Lins, Anika; Nehlmeier, Inga; Gärtner, Sabine; Moldenhauer, Anna-Sophie; Hofmann-Winkler, Heike; Wolff, Thorsten; Schindler, Michael; Pöhlmann, Stefan",Journal of virology,201,31

Social isolation, and financial insecurity are potential risk factors for mental changes. This study aimed to address public concerns, and assess mental health changes, and the factors associated with mental health burden in response to the COVID-19 outbreak in Saudi Arabia after the full lockdown is widely employed. METHODS This cross-sectional study was conducted between 30th of April, and 10th of May, 2020 by posting an online survey on social media platforms (WhatsApp, and Twitter) to collect data on participants' demographics, concerns and worries related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and mental health changes using a validated Arabic version of the self-rated Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). RESULTS A total of 1,921 responded to the questionnaire. Of them, 1,429 (74.5%) were ≤ 45 years old, and 967 (50.3%) were males. Reported public concerns included disturbed lifestyle, getting self or family member infected, loss job or part of income, difficult access to routine health care, and 55.8% reported negative impact on their mental health. Hospital anxiety and depression scale revealed high rates of depression [717 (37.3%)], and anxiety [508 (26.4%)].

We review different biomarkers to evaluate if they are able to predict clinical outcomes and correlate with the severity of COVID-19 disease. Methods A systematic review of the literature was carried out to identify relevant articles using six different databases. Keywords to refine the search included 'COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV2', 'Biomarkers', among others. Only studies which reported data on pre-defined outcomes were included. Key findings Thirty-four relevant articles were identified which reviewed the following biomarkers: C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, interleukin-6, lactate dehydrogenase, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, D-dimer, cardiac troponin, renal biomarkers, lymphocytes and platelet count. Of these, all but two, showed significantly higher levels in patients with severe complications of COVID-19 infection compared to their non-severe counterparts. Lymphocytes and platelet count showed significantly lower levels in severe patients compared to non-severe patients. Significance Although research is still in its early stages, the discovery of how different biomarkers behave during the course of the disease could help clinicians in identifying severe disease earlier and subsequently improve prognosis.

Clinical diagnosis of influenza-like illness (ILI) is complicated by non-specific symptomatology. Rapid flu tests (RFTs) impact treatment decisions and may improve patient care; yet, recommendations for RFT use are broad, and the performance of unaided clinical diagnosis relative to RFTs is unclear. OBJECTIVES To determine age-stratified, overall sensitivities and specificities of the widely studied RFT, QuickVue® (Quidel Corporation, San Diego, CA), and clinical diagnosis of ILI by meta-analysis and to seek factors associated with poorer clinical diagnostic discrimination. METHODS A systematic literature review was conducted using article selection criteria identifying studies indexed in PubMed/MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library, and other pertinent sources of studies reporting sensitivity, specificity, and effects of RFTs and clinical diagnosis on decision-making for patients with ILI. RESULTS QuickVue's® diagnostic specificity exceeds that of unaided clinical diagnosis by 29-31%. False-positive results occur approximately 8.2 times more frequently by unaided clinical diagnosis than by the RFT alone. These findings were unaffected by seasonal variations in disease prevalence. RFTs reduce diagnostic testing, antibiotic use, and emergency department utilization while increasing antiviral prescription rates. No systematic relationship between the broadness of clinical diagnostic criteria for influenza and diagnostic performance was observed across studies included in this review. CONCLUSIONS Use of RFTs improves seasonal influenza diagnostic specificity above that based on unaided clinical diagnosis irrespective of the broadness of clinical diagnostic criteria, and affects clinical decision-making. These results provide an improved framework upon which to diagnose influenza, design future RFT studies, and modify existing recommendations for improved ILI patient management.","Petrozzino, Jeffrey J; Smith, Cynthia; Atkinson, Mark J",The Journal of emergency medicine,201,31

However, thresholds are not uniform across all analysis methods due to dependencies on patient demographics and computational algorithms. This study aimed to investigate optimal perfusion thresholds for quantifying infarct and penumbra volumes using two post-processing CTP algorithms: Vitrea Bayesian and singular value decomposition plus (SVD+). We utilized 107 AIS patients (67 non-intervention patients and 40 successful reperfusion of thrombolysis in cerebral infarction (2b/3) patients). Infarct volumes were predicted for both post-processing algorithms through contralateral hemisphere comparisons using absolute time-to-peak (TTP) and relative regional cerebral blood volume (rCBV) thresholds ranging from +2.8 seconds to +9.3 seconds and -0.23 to -0.56 respectively. Optimal thresholds were determined by minimizing differences between predicted CTP and 24-hour fluid-attenuation inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging infarct. Optimal thresholds were tested on 60 validation patients (30 intervention and 30 non-intervention) and compared using RAPID CTP software. Among the 67 non-intervention and 40 intervention patients, the following optimal thresholds were determined: intervention Bayesian: TTP = +4.8 seconds, rCBV = -0.29; intervention SVD+: TTP = +5.8 seconds, rCBV = -0.29; non-intervention Bayesian: TTP = +5.3 seconds, rCBV = -0.32; non-intervention SVD+: TTP = +6.3 seconds, rCBV = -0.26. When comparing SVD+ and Bayesian post-processing algorithms, optimal thresholds for TTP were significantly different for intervention and non-intervention patients. rCBV optimal thresholds were equal for intervention patients and significantly different for non-intervention patients.

Influenza viruses can have frequent antigenic variation and changes, which can result in rapid and widespread transmission resulting in annual epidemics and outbreaks in places of public gathering such as schools, kindergartens and nursing homes. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that seasonal influenza epidemics have caused an annual 3 to 5 million severe cases, and 290000 to 650000 deaths globally. Pregnant women, young children, the elderly, and persons with chronic illnesses are at high risk for severe illness and death associated with influenza virus infection. Especially, COVID-19 pandemic might co-circulate with other respiratory infectious diseases such as influenza in the coming winter-spring season. Seasonal influenza vaccination is the most effective way to prevent influenza virus infection and complications from infection. Currently, China has licensed trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV3) which includes split-virus influenza vaccine and subunit vaccine, quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV4) which is split, and trivalent live attenuated influenza vaccine(LAIV3) which was newly licensed. Except for a few major cities, influenza vaccine is a category Ⅱ vaccine, which means influenza vaccination is voluntary, and recipients must pay for it. In 2018 and 2019, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention issued the""Technical Guidelines for Seasonal Influenza Vaccination in China"". In the past year, new research evidences home and abroad have been published, and new seasonal influenza vaccine has been licensed in China. To strengthen the technical guidance for prevention and control of influenza and operational research on influenza vaccination in China, the National Immunization Advisory Committee (NIAC) Influenza Vaccination Technical Working Group (TWG), updated the 2019-2020 technical guidelines and compiled the ""Technical guidelines for seasonal influenza vaccination in China (2020-2021)"". The main updates in this version include the following: First, new research evidences especially studies of China, including disease burden, effectiveness, Vaccine-avoidable disease burden, vaccine safety monitoring, and cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit. Second, policies and measures for influenza prevention and control issued by National Health Commission(PRC)in the past year. Thirdly, new type seasonal influenza vaccine licensed and issued in 2020-2021 in China. Fourth, northern hemisphere influenza vaccination composition for the 2020-2021 season which included trivalent and quadrivalent influenza vaccine. Fifth, Influenza vaccination recommendations for 2020-2021 influenza season. The recommendations described in this report include the following: Points of Vaccination clinics (PoVs) should provide influenza vaccination to all persons aged 6 months and above who are willing to be vaccinated and do not have contraindications. No preferential recommendation is made for one influenza vaccine product over another for persons for whom more than one licensed, recommended, and appropriate product is available. Considering the situation of globally pandemic of COVID-19, to decrease the risk of influenza virus infection and minimize the impact on COVID-19 prevention and control, we recommend the following priority for seasonal influenza vaccination: (1) healthcare workers, including clinical doctors and nurses, public health professionals, quarantine professionals; (2) Vulnerable groups living in nursing homes or welfare homes and staffs who take care those vulnerable groups; (3) People in some key places, such as teachers and students in kindergartens, primary and secondary school, prisoners and staffs of prisons; (4) Other high risk group of influenza, including adults ≥60 years of age, children aged 6-59 months, persons with specific chronic diseases, the family members and caregivers of infants <6 months of age, and pregnant women or women who plan to become pregnant during the influenza season. Children aged 6 months through 8 years require 2 doses of influenza vaccine administered a minimum of 4 weeks apart during their first season of vaccination for optimal protection. People whoever get IIV or LAIV all apply to the principle. If they were vaccinated in 2019-2020 influenza season or a prior season, 1 dose is recommended. People more than 8 years old require 1 dose of influenza vaccine. It is recommended that people receive their influenza vaccination by the end of October. Influenza vaccination should be offered as soon as the vaccination is available. For the people unable to be vaccinated before the end of October, influenza vaccination will continue to be offered for the whole season.

In this study, a Cu/Co/Ni ternary nanoalloy (Cu/Co/Ni TNA) is synthesized with oleylamine reducing method. It is found that Cu/Co/Ni TNA greatly enhances the chemiluminescence (CL) signal of hydroxylamine-O-sulfonicacid (HOSA)-luminol system. The CL properties of the Cu/Co/Ni TNA are investigated systemically. And the possible CL mechanism also is intensively investigated. Based on enhanced CL phenomenon of Cu/Co/Ni TNA, a Cu/Co/Ni TNA, penicillin and anti-L. monocytogenes (Listeria monocytogenes) antibody-based sandwich complex assay for detection of L. monocytogenes is established. In this sandwich CL assay, penicillin is employed to capture and enrich pathogenic bacteria with penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) while anti-L. monocytogenes antibody is adopted as the specific recognition molecule to recognize L. monocytogenes. L. monocytogenes is detected sensitively based on this new Cu/Co/Ni TNA-HOSA-luminol CL system. The CL intensity is proportional to the L. monocytogenes concentration ranging from 2.0 × 102 CFU mL-1 to 3.0 × 107 CFU mL-1 and the limit of detection is 70 CFU mL-1 . The reliability and potential applications of our method was verified by comparison with official method and recovery test in environment and food samples.","Zhang, Yue; Cui, Gaoxi; Meng, Yuchan; Wang, Yujing; Hun, Xu",Luminescence : the journal of biological and chemical luminescence,201,19

However, the best timing for umbilical cord clamping in this condition is unknown. The aim of this study was to explore the duration of effective umbilico-placental circulation able to promote cardiorespiratory adaptation at birth during intact cord resuscitation. Umbilico-placental blood flow and vascular resistances were measured in an experimental neonatal lamb model. After a C-section delivery, the lambs were resuscitated ventilated for 1 h while the cord was intact. The maximum and mean umbilico-placental blood flow were respectively 230 ± 75 and 160 ± 12 mL·min-1 during the 1 h course of the experiment. However, umbilico-placental blood flow decreased and vascular resistance increased significantly 40 min after birth (p < 0.05). These results suggest that significant cardiorespiratory support can be provided by sustained placental circulation for at least 1 h during intact cord resuscitation.","Le Duc, Kévin; Aubry, Estelle; Mur, Sébastien; Besengez, Capucine; Garabedian, Charles; De Jonckheere, Julien; Storme, Laurent; Sharma, Dyuti",Children,201,8

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS Twenty-nine horses (32 tarsi) with OCF in the PIJ. METHODS Medical records of horses with radiographic evidence of OCF in the PIJ were reviewed. Clinical features, number of fragments, location, arthroscopic appearance, and outcome were recorded. Technical modifications with visual aids specific to this arthroscopic technique are described. RESULTS Twenty-seven horses (93%) had radiographic evidence of osteochondritis dissecans lesions in the tarsocrural joint (TCJ). OCF were most commonly located distal to the medial trochlear ridge of the talus. In all cases, fragments were successfully retrieved with a technique based on exposing the fragments after resection of the proximal intertarsal joint capsule (PIJC). Fragments were visible from the TCJ prior resection of the PIJC in 4 of 32 tarsi. A third portal was created to access fragments located distal to the lateral trochlear ridge in 3 of 32 tarsi. Moderate intra-articular bleeding occurred when the PIJC was resected in 3 of 32 tarsi. One horse had postoperative swelling that resolved with conservative medical management. All horses with long-term follow-up available (16/29) started training or returned to their athletic career. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE The arthroscopic technique based on resection of PIJC was effective in retrieving OCF in the PIJ and was associated with minor complications. The clinical relevance of these fragments in the PIJ remains unknown.","Espinosa-Mur, Pablo; Coté, Nathalie; Desjardins, Marc R",Veterinary surgery : VS,201,1

METHODS Systematic review and semi-quantitative analysis. Eleven electronic databases were searched to identify all relevant randomized and non-randomized controlled trials. Studies had to report overall PA as the main outcome to be eligible for inclusion in the review. The main outcomes of the studies is a quantified measure of overall PA. Additionally, all studies had to report sex/gender disaggregated overall PA at baseline and/or follow up and/or explain how they dealt with sex/gender during outcome analysis (i.e., sex/gender adjusted analyses) and/or report that there were no differences in the outcome when looking at sex/gender. PRISMA guidelines were followed. Two authors independently screened studies for eligibility and assessed the risk of bias. Semi-quantitative analyses were conducted to evaluate intervention effects, taking into account the extent to which studies have considered sex/gender aspects. To evaluate sex/gender considerations in primary studies, a newly developed sex/gender checklist was used. The study was registered previously (registration number CRD42018109528). RESULTS In total, 97 articles reporting 94 unique studies with 164 outcomes for overall PA were included in the present review. Average sample size was 829 participants, ranging from five to 9839. Participants' ages ranged from three to 19 years. Our review shows that overall 35% of PA outcomes had significant effects in increasing overall PA of children and adolescents. Not including single sex/gender studies, 105 out of 120 PA outcomes resulted in same intervention effects for boys and girls. The interventions reported to have similar effects on PA outcomes for boys and girls showed higher quality of reporting sex/gender aspects of measurement instruments, participant flow and intervention content and materials than PA outcomes with effects only in boys or only in girls. Overall, consideration of sex/gender aspects in intervention studies is low. CONCLUSIONS There is still a need to address sufficient consideration of sex/gender aspects in developing and implementing interventions in the context of PA.","Schulze, Carolin; Demetriou, Yolanda; Emmerling, Sandra; Schlund, Annegret; Phillips, Susan P; Puil, Lorri; Coen, Stephanie E; Reimers, Anne K",BMC pediatrics,201,31

The siRNA binding properties of the dendrimers and PEI 25 kDa were simulated, binding and stability were measured in SYBR Gold assays, and hydrodynamic diameters, zeta potentials, and cytotoxicity were quantified. These parameters were compared with cellular uptake of the complexes and their ability to mediate RNAi. Radiolabeled complexes were administered intravenously, and pharmacokinetic profiles and biodistribution of these polyplexes were assessed both invasively and non-invasively. All flexible triazine dendrimers formed thermodynamically more stable complexes than PEI. While PEI and the generation 4 dendrimer interacted more superficially with siRNA, generation 2 and 3 virtually coalesced with siRNA, forming a tightly intertwined structure. These dendriplexes were therefore more efficiently charge-neutralized than PEI complexes, reducing agglomeration. This behavior was confirmed by results of hydrodynamic diameters (72.0 nm-153.5 nm) and zeta potentials (4.9 mV-21.8 mV in 10 mM HEPES) of the dendriplexes in comparison to PEI complexes (312.8 nm-480.0 nm and 13.7 mV-17.4 mV in 10 mM HEPES). All dendrimers, even generation 3 and 4, were less toxic than PEI. All dendriplexes were efficiently endocytosed and showed significant and specific luciferase knockdown in HeLa/Luc cells. Scintillation counting confirmed that the generation 2 triazine complexes showed more than twofold prolonged circulation times as a result of their good thermodynamic stability. Conversely, generation 3 complexes dissociated in vivo, and generation 4 complexes were captured by the reticulo-endothelial system due to their increased surface charge. Molecular modeling proves very valuable for rationalizing experimental parameters based on the dendrimers' structural properties. Non-invasive molecular imaging predicted the in vivo fate of the complexes. Therefore, both techniques effectively promote the rapid development of safe and efficient siRNA formulations that are stable in vivo.","Merkel, Olivia M; Zheng, Mengyao; Mintzer, Meredith A; Pavan, Giovanni M; Librizzi, Damiano; Maly, Marek; Höffken, Helmut; Danani, Andrea; Simanek, Eric E; Kissel, Thomas",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,201,16

The aim of this study was to measure the prevalence and severity of psychological distress in the community due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods This cross-sectional survey was conducted in February and March 2020 in Tehran, Iran. We analyzed demographic characteristics and assessed depression, anxiety, and stress levels in 241 people using convenience sampling and the DASS-21 questionnaire. All statistical analyses were performed using R. Results The study population included 241 community-dwelling participants, of whom 145 were women and 96 were males. The mean age was 49.16 ± 8.01 years. Approximately two-thirds of participants (n = 158) reported no history of comorbid illness. The mean scores of depression and stress were at a ""severe"" level, while anxiety levels were at an ""extremely severe"" level. The prevalence of severe and extremely severe depression readings was 51.45 and 38.17%, respectively. In the anxiety subscale, the prevalence of severe and extremely severe depression was 95.90 and 4.1%, and in the stress subscale the prevalence was 48.97 and 4.98%, respectively. Conclusion In this study, people reported experiencing severe and extremely severe psychological distress. Therefore, there is an urgent need to implement mental health intervention policies to cope with this ongoing challenge.

This study aimed at describing self-reported changes in emotional reactions associated with COVID-19 among medical students in Jordan and to assessing the potential effect of social media utilization on emotional distress among this group. Methods: A cross-sectional design was utilized to collect data early on during the outbreak in Jordan. All medical students in Jordan were eligible to complete an online questionnaire assessing self-reported emotional reactions to COVID-19 that covered four main domains: negative emotion (anxiety, worry, depression, panic, loneliness, and nervousness), positive emotion (happiness, joy, and excitement), sleep disorders (insomnia, shallow sleep, nightmares, and insufficient sleep), and aggression (verbal argument and physical fighting). The frequency of social media utilization as a main source of COVID-19 information was also assessed. Results: 59.9% of participants were females, 64.9% were enrolled at the two major medical schools in Jordan, and 59.6% were in the pre-clinical stage (years). A significant proportion of participants self-reported increased negative emotional levels of anxiety (49.2%), worry (72.4%), depression (23.1%), panic (22.6%), and nervousness (38.2%) and decreased positive emotional levels of happiness (44.8%), joy (47.3%), and feelings of excitement (45.1%). Self-reported sleep disorders were not as common (less than 15% for any of the four items), while arguing with others was at 26.7%. Significant differences by gender and academic year were detected. Almost half of participants reported using social media as a main source of COVID-19 information ""most/all-the-times"" with a significant effect of such on reducing emotional distress.

Since positive-sense RNA viruses have frequently been found to replicate in association with membranous structures, in this work we characterized the replication of the human astrovirus serotype 8 strain Yuc8 in Caco-2 cells, using density gradient centrifugation and free-flow zonal electrophoresis (FFZE) to fractionate cellular membranes. Structural and nonstructural viral proteins, positive- and negative-sense viral RNA, and infectious virus particles were found to be associated with a distinct population of membranes separated by FFZE. The cellular proteins associated with this membrane population in infected and mock-infected cells were identified by tandem mass spectrometry. The results indicated that membranes derived from multiple cell organelles were present in the population. Gene ontology and protein-protein interaction network analysis showed that groups of proteins with roles in fatty acid synthesis and ATP biosynthesis were highly enriched in the fractions of this population in infected cells. Based on this information, we investigated by RNA interference the role that some of the identified proteins might have in the replication cycle of the virus. Silencing of the expression of genes involved in cholesterol (DHCR7, CYP51A1) and fatty acid (FASN) synthesis, phosphatidylinositol (PI4KIIIβ) and inositol phosphate (ITPR3) metabolism, and RNA helicase activity (DDX23) significantly decreased the amounts of Yuc8 genomic and antigenomic RNA, synthesis of the structural protein VP90, and virus yield. These results strongly suggest that astrovirus RNA replication and particle assembly take place in association with modified membranes potentially derived from multiple cell organelles. IMPORTANCE Astroviruses are common etiological agents of acute gastroenteritis in children and immunocompromised patients. More recently, they have been associated with neurological diseases in mammals, including humans, and are also responsible for different pathologies in birds. In this work, we provide evidence that astrovirus RNA replication and virus assembly occur in contact with cell membranes potentially derived from multiple cell organelles and show that membrane-associated cellular proteins involved in lipid metabolism are required for efficient viral replication. Our findings provide information to enhance our knowledge of astrovirus biology and provide information that might be useful for the development of therapeutic interventions to prevent virus replication.","Murillo, Andrea; Vera-Estrella, Rosario; Barkla, Bronwyn J; Méndez, Ernesto; Arias, Carlos F",Journal of virology,201,20

Its insights emerge from the comparison of three modern yoga styles that were developed for Western English-speaking cultural contexts - Iyengar, Bikram and Forrest - and which differ in form but also in the chronology of their emergence on the global yoga market and that of their reception in France. These three yoga styles are also branded through contrasting mythologies of transformational healing, and the aim of this paper is to explore how a brand conceptualization of yoga as a health practice relates to or resonates with the embodied experiences of practitioners, and to the socio-cultural contexts in which practitioners and their practices are embedded. The paper contributes a new case study to the global yoga scholarship and to a poorly studied French yoga scene, but more importantly, it cross-examines the discourses through which a yoga style is branded, the way it is transmitted, and the social context and social positioning of the individuals who practice it. Combining perspectives on the body, narrative and rituals, it identifies how yoga healing is construed in relation to gender, ethnicity and class and the points of consensus and dissent that emerge from the encounters between French social bodies and exogenous yoga styles.","Ben Hamed, Mahé",Anthropology & medicine,201,16

A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that the classification features of the CAS-HC were strong, but supported a less stringent cut-score for this population. Construct validity was supported by the positive correlations between the CAS-HC and measures of depression and generalized anxiety, while known groups validity was found with high CAS-HC scores exhibited by those working in emergency rooms, triage, and intensive care units.

In this retrospective cohort study, we investigated the long-term effectiveness of targeted biopsy in tertiary care hospitals, using the follow-up data from patients with UC for ≥ 8 years who had enrolled in the initial RCT. The primary outcome was death from colorectal cancer (CRC). Secondary outcomes were advanced neoplasia (CRC or high-grade dysplasia) and colectomy due to neoplasia after the RCT. We compared these outcomes between target and random groups. Data on 195 of the 221 patients (88.2%) enrolled in the previous RCT were collected from 28 institutions between 2008 and 2019. No patients died of CRC in either group, with a median 8.8-year follow-up demonstrating a robustness for targeted biopsy in terms of CRC death prevention. Advanced neoplasia was detected in four and three patients in the target and random groups, respectively. Colectomy was required due to neoplasia in three patients in each group. The chance of developing CRC in patients with a negative colonoscopy was low, and the targeted biopsy appeared effective in this population. Conversely, patients found with low-grade dysplasia at initial RCT have 10-fold higher risk of progression to high-grade dysplasia and/or CRC. Ten extracolonic malignancies were observed during the follow-up, resulting in four deaths. Panchromoendoscopy was used only in 4.6% and targeted biopsy was only performed in 59.1% of colonoscopies.

The first step towards health equity is agreement on a set of national indicators, reflecting equity in healthcare provision and health outcomes, and allowing monitoring of the impact of interventions on the reduction of disparities. We describe the process of reaching a consensus on a defined set of national equity indicators. METHODS The study was conducted between January 2019 and June 2020, in a multistage design: (A) Identifying appropriate and available inequity measures via interviews with stakeholders. (B) Agreement on the screening criteria (public health importance; gap characteristics; potential for change; public interest) and relative weighting. (C) Constructing the consultation framework as an online, 3-round Delphi technique, with a range of experts recruited from the health, welfare and education sectors. RESULTS Participants were of diverse age, gender, geographic location, religion and ethnicity, and came from academia, healthcare provision, government ministries and patient representative groups. Thirty measures of inequity, presented to participants, represented the following domains: Health promotion (11 indicators), acute and chronic morbidity (11), life expectancy and mortality (2), health infrastructures and affordability of care (4), education and employment (2). Of the 77 individuals contacted, 75 (97%) expressed willingness to participate, and 55 (73%) completed all three scoring rounds. The leading ten indicators were: Diabetes care, childhood obesity, adult obesity, distribution of healthcare personnel, fatal childhood injuries, cigarette smoking, infant mortality, ability to afford care, access to psychotherapy and distribution of hospital beds. Agreement among raters, measured as intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC), was 0.75.

Despite this, little is known about young children's awareness of their PM ability (metamemory), how metamemory is affected by PM task difficulty, and how metacognitive abilities might be related to metamemory. The current study examined the effect of task difficulty on children's PM predictions, actual performance, and postdictions and relations among episodic memory metamemory, metacognitive control, and executive functioning. Children aged 4 to 6 years (N = 131) made PM predictions, completed an easy or difficult PM task, and then made PM postdictions. Children also made predictions and postdictions for their performance on an episodic recall task and then completed an independent measure of metacognitive control and two measures of executive function (working memory and inhibition). Results showed that (a) children's PM increased with age and was worse in the difficult PM task condition, (b) PM predictions and postdictions did not increase with age and only PM postdictions were affected by PM task difficulty; (c) children's PM and episodic recall predictions and postdictions were more accurate with age, (d) children's PM postdictions best predicted PM performance, whereas predictions best predicted episodic recall task performance, and (e) children with better metacognitive control had better PM and more accurate PM predictions. These results are discussed in terms of young children's optimism surrounding their memory performance and the emergence of early metacognitive abilities.","Lavis, Lydia; Mahy, Caitlin E V",Journal of experimental child psychology,201,10

Phytoplankton are the entrance of PBDEs entering to biotic environments from abiotic environments, while the responding mechanisms of phytoplankton to PBDEs have not been full established. Therefore, we chose the model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana in this study, by integrating whole transcriptome analysis with physiological-biochemical data, to reveal the molecular responding mechanisms of T. pseudonana to the toxicity of BDE-47. Our results indicated the changes of genes expressions correlated to the physiological-biochemical changes, and there were multiple molecular mechanisms of T. pseudonana responding to the toxicity of BDE-47: Gene expressions evidence explained the suppression of light reaction and proved the occurrence of cellular oxidative stress; In the meanwhile, up-regulations of genes in pathways involving carbon metabolisms happened, including the Calvin cycle, glycolysis, TCA cycle, fatty acid synthesis, and triacylglycerol synthesis; Lastly, DNA damage was found and three outcome including DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and programmed cell death (PCD) happened, which could finally inhibit the cell division and population growth of T. pseudonana. This study presented the most complete molecular responding mechanisms of phytoplankton cells to PBDEs, and provided valuable information of various PBDEs-sensitive genes with multiple functions for further research involving organic pollutants and phytoplankton.","Zhao, Yirong; Tang, Xuexi; Lv, Mengchen; Liu, Qian; Li, Jun; Zhang, Bihan; Li, Luying; Zhang, Xinxin; Zhao, Yan",Aquatic toxicology,201,1

METHODS We performed a retrospective multicentre cohort study of 9,991 consecutive patients hospitalized in a major New York academic centre between March 7th and June 5th, 2020 with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. The clinical outcomes assessed included risk of hospitalization, in-hospital mortality, risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and need for mechanical ventilation among smokers (current and former). Multivariable logistic regression and propensity score models were built to adjust for potential confounders. FINDINGS Among 9,991 consecutive patients diagnosed with COVID-19, 2,212 (22.1%) patients were self-reported smokers (406 current and 1806 former). Current smoking was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (propensity score [PS]-adjusted OR 0.91; p=0.46), in-hospital mortality (PS-OR 0.77; p=0.12), ICU admission (PS-OR 1.18; p=0.37), or intubation (PS-OR 1.04; p=0.85). Similarly, former smoking was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (PS-OR 0.88; p=0.11), in-hospital mortality (PS-OR 1.03; p=0.78), ICU admission (PS-OR 1.03; p=0.95), or intubation (PS-OR 0.93; p=0.57). Furthermore, smoking (current or former) was not associated with an increased risk of hospitalization (PS-OR 0.85; p=0.05), in-hospital mortality (PS-OR 0.94; p=0.49), ICU admission (PS-OR 0.86; p=0.17), or intubation (PS-OR 0.79; p=0.06). INTERPRETATION Smoking is a well-known risk factor associated with greater susceptibility and subsequent increased severity of respiratory infections. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, smokers may have increased risk and severe pneumonia. In the current COVID-19 pandemic, smokers are believed to have an increased risk of mortality as well as severe pneumonia. However, in our analysis of real-world clinical data, smoking was not associated with increased in-patient mortality in COVID-19 pneumonia, in accordance with prior reports.

The most notable change in this 5th edition is the addition of new recommendations for the use of endovascular therapy for patients with acute ischemic stroke and proximal intracranial arterial occlusion. This includes an overview of the infrastructure and resources required for stroke centers that will provide endovascular therapy as well as regional structures needed to ensure that all patients with acute ischemic stroke that are eligible for endovascular therapy will be able to access this newly approved therapy; recommendations for hyperacute brain and enhanced vascular imaging using computed tomography angiography and computed tomography perfusion; patient selection criteria based on the five trials of endovascular therapy published in early 2015, and performance metric targets for important time-points involved in endovascular therapy, including computed tomography-to-groin puncture and computed tomography-to-reperfusion times. Other updates in this guideline include recommendations for improved time efficiencies for all aspects of hyperacute stroke care with a movement toward a new median target door-to-needle time of 30 min, with the 90th percentile being 60 min. A stronger emphasis is placed on increasing public awareness of stroke with the recent launch of the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada FAST signs of stroke campaign; reinforcing the public need to seek immediate medical attention by calling 911; further engagement of paramedics in the prehospital phase with prehospital notification to the receiving emergency department, as well as the stroke team, including neuroradiology; updates to the triage and same-day assessment of patients with transient ischemic attack; updates to blood pressure recommendations for the hyperacute phase of care for ischemic stroke, intracerebral hemorrhage, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The goal of these recommendations and supporting materials is to improve efficiencies and minimize the absolute time lapse between stroke symptom onset and reperfusion therapy, which in turn leads to better outcomes and potentially shorter recovery times.","Casaubon, Leanne K; Boulanger, Jean-Martin; Blacquiere, Dylan; Boucher, Scott; Brown, Kyla; Goddard, Tom; Gordon, Jacqueline; Horton, Myles; Lalonde, Jeffrey; LaRivière, Christian; Lavoie, Pascale; Leslie, Paul; McNeill, Jeanne; Menon, Bijoy K; Moses, Brian; Penn, Melanie; Perry, Jeff; Snieder, Elizabeth; Tymianski, Dawn; Foley, Norine; Smith, Eric E; Gubitz, Gord; Hill, Michael D; Glasser, Ev; Lindsay, Patrice",International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society,201,13

METHODS Serological responses of CP-infused MERS patients during the 2015 Korean MERS outbreak at a tertiary care centre were evaluated. Serological activity was evaluated with anti-MERS-CoV enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) immunoglobulin (Ig)G, ELISA IgA, immunofluorescence assay IgM and plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Donor plasma and one or two recipient's serum samples per week of illness including one taken the day after each CP infusion were evaluated. For sensitivity and specificity analysis of ELISA IgG in predicting neutralization activity, a data set of 138 previously evaluated MERS-CoV-infected patients was used. RESULTS Three of thirteen MERS patients with respiratory failure received four CP infusions from convalesced MERS-CoV-infected patients, and only two of them showed neutralizing activity. Donor plasma with a PRNT titre 1:80 demonstrated meaningful serological response after CP infusion, while that with a PRNT titre 1:40 did not. ELISA IgG predicted neutralization activity of a PRNT titre ≥1:80 with more than 95% specificity at a cutoff optical density (OD) ratio of 1.6, and with 100% specificity at an OD ratio of 1.9. CONCLUSIONS For effective CP infusion in MERS, donor plasma with a neutralization activity of a PRNT titre ≥1:80 should be used. ELISA IgG could substitute for the neutralization test in resource-limited situations.","Ko, Jae-Hoon; Seok, Hyeri; Cho, Sun Young; Ha, Young Eun; Baek, Jin Yang; Kim, So Hyun; Kim, Yae-Jean; Park, Jin Kyeong; Chung, Chi Ryang; Kang, Eun-Suk; Cho, Duck; Müller, Marcel A; Drosten, Christian; Kang, Cheol-In; Chung, Doo Ryeon; Song, Jae-Hoon; Peck, Kyong Ran",Antiviral therapy,201,7

METHODS In a human experimental model, 6 cm of jejunum was selectively exposed to 30 min of ischemia (I) followed by 30 and 120 min of reperfusion (R). A sham procedure was also performed. Blood and tissue was sampled at all-time points. Functional barrier function was assessed using dual-sugar absorption tests with lactulose (L) and rhamnose (R). Plasma concentrations of citrulline, an amino acid described as marker for enterocyte function were measured as marker of metabolic enterocytes restoration. Damage to the epithelial lining was assessed by immunohistochemistry for tight junctions (TJs), by plasma marker for enterocytes damage (I-FABP) and analyzed by electron microscopy (EM) using lanthanum nitrate as an electrondense marker. RESULTS Plasma L/R ratio's were significantly increased after 30 min of ischemia (30I) followed by 30 min of reperfusion (30R) compared to control (0.75 ± 0.10 vs 0.20 ± 0.09, P < 0.05). At 120 min of reperfusion (120R), ratio's normalized (0.17 ± 0.06) and were not significantly different from control. Plasma levels of I-FABP correlated with plasma L/R ratios measured at the same time points (correlation: 0.467, P < 0.01). TJs staining shows distortion of staining at 30I. An intact lining of TJs was again observed at 30I120R. Electron microscopy analysis revealed disrupted TJs after 30I with paracellular leakage of lanthanum nitrate, which restored after 30I120R. Furthermore, citrulline concentrations closely paralleled the histological perturbations during intestinal IR. CONCLUSION This study directly correlates histological data with intestinal permeability tests, revealing that the human gut has the ability of to withstand short episodes of ischemia, with morphological and functional recovery of the intestinal barrier within 120 min of reperfusion.","Schellekens, Dirk Hsm; Hundscheid, Inca Hr; Leenarts, Claire Aji; Grootjans, Joep; Lenaerts, Kaatje; Buurman, Wim A; Dejong, Cornelis Hc; Derikx, Joep Pm",World journal of gastroenterology,201,1

We hypothesized that the addition of an intrathecal injection of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) to bupivacaine would improve perioperative shivering in female patients undergoing elective caesarean section. METHODS In a block-randomized, double-blinded, controlled trial 72 patients scheduled for elective caesarean section with spinal anesthesia were separated into two groups. In the treatment group, 2 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine plus 25 mg MgSO4 (0.5 ml) were injected intrathecally, and in the control group 2 ml of 0.5% bupivacaine plus 0.5 ml normal saline were injected intrathecally. Core temperature was measured before and after drug injection at predetermined intervals. Sedation was graded using the Ramsay sedation scale. RESULTS No significant intergroup differences in appearance of shivering were seen immediately or at 5, 30, 40, 50, 60, and 90 min after block administration. However, at 10, 15, and 20 min post block, there was a significant difference in shivering. The group administered MgSO4 showed lower shivering grades compared with the control group. Core temperature was significantly reduced in the MgSO4 group compared to the normal saline group 30 min after blocking.

We examined the relation of serum LL-37 levels to the severity of bronchiolitis and viral etiology. Methods We performed a 17-center prospective cohort study in infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis over 3 winters (2011-2014). Site teams collected clinical data, nasopharyngeal aspirates and serum. We used real-time polymerase chain reaction to test nasopharyngeal aspirates for 16 viruses. We tested serum for LL-37. Severity of bronchiolitis was defined by intensive care use and hospital length of stay. Viral etiology was defined as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or rhinovirus (RV), including coinfections with other viruses. Results The median age of the 1005 enrolled infants was 3 months (interquartile range, 2-6 months). After adjustment for 12 variables, LL-37 levels in the lowest quartile, compared with the highest, were associated both with intensive care use (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.97; P = .01) and longer hospital stay (1.34; P < .001). In separate multivariable models, infants with LL-37 levels in the lowest 3 quartiles, compared with the highest, were more likely to have RSV (eg, aOR, 2.6 [lowest quartile]; P < .001 [all quartiles]). By contrast, infants with the lowest 3 LL-37 quartiles were less likely to have RV (eg, aOR, 0.5 [lowest quartile]; Pall quartiles ≤ .03 [all quartiles]). Conclusions In a large multicenter study of infants hospitalized with bronchiolitis, lower levels of serum LL-37 were associated with increased severity of illness. There was also an inverse relationship between LL-37 levels and the most common virus causing bronchiolitis, RSV. These findings highlight the role of LL-37 in the pathogenesis of bronchiolitis.","Mansbach, Jonathan M; Hasegawa, Kohei; Ajami, Nadim J; Petrosino, Joseph F; Piedra, Pedro A; Tierney, Courtney N; Espinola, Janice A; Camargo, Carlos A",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,201,1

Here, a pH-responsive polymersome codelivering hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and tunicamycin (Tuni) drugs is developed to simultaneously induce endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and autophagic flux blockade for achieving an antitumor effect and inhibiting tumor metastasis. The pH response of poly(β-amino ester) and HCQ synergistically deacidifies the lysosomes, thereby blocking the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes and lastly blocking autophagic flux. The function mechanism of regulating autophagy was systematically investigated on orthotopic luciferase gene-transfected, 4T1 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice through Western blot and immunohistochemistry analyses. The Tuni triggers ER stress to regulate the PERK/Akt signaling pathway to increase the autophagic level. The ""autophagic stress"" generated by triggering ER stress-induced autophagy and blocking autophagic flux is effective against tumors. The reduced expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 due to ER stress and reduced focal adhesions turnover due to the blockade of autophagic flux synergistically inhibit tumor metastasis.","Xu, Funeng; Li, Xilin; Huang, Xuehui; Pan, Jingmei; Wang, Yi; Zhou, Shaobing",Science advances,201,19

A serum amylase concentration of 130 units/l or more on postoperative day (POD) 0 has been shown to be an objective surrogate of pancreatic texture, a determinant of PSCs. This study evaluated serial measurements of C-reactive protein (CRP) to refine PSC risk stratification. METHODS Consecutive patients undergoing PD between 2008 and 2014, with vascular resection if required and without preoperative chemoradiotherapy, had serum investigations from the day before operation until discharge. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to identify a threshold value of serum CRP with clinically relevant PSCs for up to 30 days after discharge as outcome measure. RESULTS Of 230 patients, 95 (41·3 per cent) experienced a clinically relevant PSC. A serum CRP level of 180 mg/l or higher on POD 2 was associated with PSCs, prolonged critical care stay and relaparotomy (all P < 0·050). Patients with a serum amylase concentration of 130 units/l or more on POD 0 who developed a serum CRP level of at least 180 mg/l on POD 2 had a higher incidence of morbidity. Patients were stratified into high-, intermediate- and low-risk groups using these markers. The low-risk category was associated with a negative predictive value of 86·5 per cent for development of clinically relevant PSCs. There were no deaths among 52 patients in the low-risk group, but seven deaths among 79 (9 per cent) in the high-risk group. CONCLUSION A serum amylase level below 130 units/l on POD 0 combined with a serum CRP level under 180 mg/l on POD 2 constitutes a low-risk profile following PD, and may help identify patients suitable for early discharge.","Palani Velu, L K; McKay, C J; Carter, C R; McMillan, D C; Jamieson, N B; Dickson, E J",The British journal of surgery,201,16

We know little about the potential of community-based peer facilitators to improve adolescent health in such contexts. METHODS We did a systematic review of peer-facilitated community-based interventions for adolescent health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We searched databases for randomised controlled trials of interventions featuring peer education, counselling, activism, and/or outreach facilitated by young people aged 10-24. We included trials with outcomes across key areas of adolescent health: infectious and vaccine preventable diseases, undernutrition, HIV/AIDS, sexual and reproductive health, unintentional injuries, violence, physical disorders, mental disorders and substance use. We summarised evidence from these trials narratively. PROSPERO registration: CRD42016039190. RESULTS We found 20 studies (61,014 adolescents). Fourteen studies tested interventions linked to schools or colleges, and 12 had non-peer-facilitated components, e.g. health worker training. Four studies had HIV-related outcomes, but none reported reductions in HIV prevalence or incidence. Nine studies had clinical sexual and reproductive health outcomes, but only one reported a positive effect: a reduction in Herpes Simplex Virus-2 incidence. Three studies had violence-related outcomes, two of which reported reductions in physical violence by school staff and perpetration of physical violence by adolescents. Seven studies had mental health outcomes, four of which reported reductions in depressive symptoms. Finally, we found eight studies on substance use, four of which reported reductions in alcohol consumption and smoking or tobacco use. There were no studies on infectious and vaccine preventable diseases, undernutrition, or injuries. CONCLUSIONS There are few trials on the effects of peer-facilitated community-based interventions for adolescent health in LMICs.

An extensive water sampling grid covered two sea water intruded coastal aquifers, namely the Kokkinochoria (A1) and Kiti-Pervolia (A2) aquifers and the Troodos massif (A3). Analytical results give a first insight to the presence of Cr (VI) in Cyprus ground and surface waters. The highest Cr (VI) value of 26 μg L-1 is observed in the Troodos area (A3) where Cr(VI) is detected in all sampled water systems (surface and ground/spring). Nonetheless, the highest median values of 4.6 and 4.5 μg L-1 are observed in the Kokkinochoria (A1) and Kiti-Pervolia (A2) study areas respectively, where the local aquifers are under increased pressure from agriculture, urbanization and seawater intrusion. Stable isotopes were used to discern the effect of return irrigation and seawater intrusion.

In times of contact restrictions, digital solutions have become increasingly important, especially for people with dementia and their mostly elderly caregiving relatives, which are at increased risk of severe illness from COVID-19. As in many other health areas, there is a lack of digital interventions in the dementia landscape that are successfully implemented (i.e., put into practice), especially digital interventions that are scientifically evaluated. Evaluated and proven effective digital interventions exist, but these often do not find their way from research into practice and stay on low-level implementation readiness. Within the project digiDEM Bayern, a digital platform with digital services and interventions for people affected by dementia (people with dementia, caregivers, volunteers and interested citizens) is established. As one digital intervention for informal caregivers, the 'Angehörigenampel' (caregivers' traffic-light) was developed, which is able to assess the physical and psychological burden of caregivers. This can help to counteract the health effects of caregiving burden early on before it is too late. The development of the digital intervention as a WordPress-plugin was kept generic so that it can easily be adapted to other languages on further websites. The 'intervention as a plugin' approach demonstrates an easy and flexible way of deploying eHealth interventions to other service providers, especially from other countries. The implementation barriers for other service providers are low enough for them to be able to easily integrate the eHealth intervention on their website, enabling more caregivers to benefit from the disseminated eHealth intervention.","Reichold, Michael; Selau, Marina; Graessel, Elmar; Kolominsky-Rabas, Peter L; Prokosch, Hans-Ulrich",Studies in health technology and informatics,201,1

We describe our experience with the use of this technique in patients undergoing transvenous AVM embolization. METHODS Consecutive patients in whom transvenous embolization was attempted at our institute between January 2017 and July 2019 were included. Anatomical AVM features, number of embolization stages, technique of concurrent transient rapid ventricular pacing and afferent arterial balloon flow arrest, complications, and clinical and radiological outcomes were recorded and tabulated. RESULTS Transvenous AVM embolization was attempted in 12 patients but abandoned in two patients for technical reasons. Complete embolization was achieved in 10 patients, five of whom had infratentorial AVMs. All 10 had a single primary draining vein. Rapid ventricular pacing was used in nine cases; IV adenosine injection was used in one case to achieve cardiac standstill. Complete AVM nidus obliteration was achieved with excellent neurologic outcome in nine cases, with transvenous embolization alone in two cases, and with staged transarterial followed by transvenous embolization in the others. Two patients developed hemorrhagic complications intraprocedurally. One patient was managed conservatively and the other operatively with AVM excision and hematoma evacuation; both made an excellent recovery without any neurologic deficits at 3 months. CONCLUSION Complete flow control using concurrent transient rapid ventricular pacing with afferent arterial balloon flow arrest technique is safe and feasible for transvenous embolization of select AVMs.","Waqas, Muhammad; Dossani, Rimal H; Vakharia, Kunal; Rai, Hamid H; Chin, Felix; Tso, Michael K; Rajah, Gary B; Snyder, Kenneth V; Davies, Jason M; Levy, Elad I; Iyer, Vijay S; Siddiqui, Adnan H",Journal of neurointerventional surgery,201,19

However, the epidemiology and clinical course of this newly identified virus have not been fully elucidated. This study investigated the epidemiology, seasonality, and clinical features of HCoV-NL63 in Hong Kong children. This study consisted of two cohorts of children hospitalized in a university-affiliated teaching hospital. In the 12-month retrospective part of the study, reverse transcription-PCR was used to detect HCoVs in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs). Positive samples were sequenced to confirm the identity of the virus and to determine its phylogenetic relationship with the HCoV-NL63 strains found elsewhere. The second part covered a subsequent 12-month period in which patients were prospectively recruited. Altogether, 1,981 and 1,001 NPA specimens were studied in 2005-2006 and 2006-2007, respectively. Seventy-four (2.5%) HCoV isolates were identified and consisted of 17 (0.6%) HCoV-NL63 isolates, 37 (1.2%) HCoV-OC43 isolates, 14 (0.5%) HCoV-HKU1 isolates, and 6 (0.2%) HCoV-229E isolates. HCoV-NL63 infection was more common in 2006-2007 than 2005-2006 (1.2% and 0.3%, respectively; P = 0.006). From 2005 to 2007, the peak season for HCoV-NL63 infection was in September-October, which was earlier than the peak for HCoV-OC43 infections (December-January). HCoV-NL63-infected patients were younger and more likely to have croup, febrile convulsions, and acute gastroenteritis. The majority of local HCoV-NL63 isolates were phylogenetically closely related to those found in Belgium and The Netherlands. In conclusion, HCoV-NL63 is an important yet uncommon virus among our hospitalized children with acute RTIs.","Leung, Ting Fan; Li, Chung Yi; Lam, Wai Yip; Wong, Gary W K; Cheuk, Edmund; Ip, Margaret; Ng, Pak Cheung; Chan, Paul K S",Journal of clinical microbiology,201,7
137005,137005,137005,Effectiveness of social egg freezing: protocol for systematic review and meta-analyses.,20.002174,8.627445,2019,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic Roux-Y gastric bypass (LRYGBP) is the gold-standard procedure for the treatment of morbid obesity. It has been reported to be somewhat more efficient and durable than laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). However, it is considered more invasive and, therefore, more hazardous. There is a lack of unity in complication reporting following bariatric surgery. Thus, there is a possible misconception regarding the relative safety of the two major bariatric procedures performed worldwide. This may have contributed to a shift in practice with LSG gaining momentum ""at the expense"" of LRYGBP. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relative safety of primary LSG and LRYGBP according to the Clavien-Dindo complication grading system. METHODS A total of 2651 and 554 patients underwent primary LSG and LRYGBP, respectively at three high-volume centers. Thirty-day perioperative complications were recorded and graded. Length of hospital stays (LOS) and readmission rates were collected as well. RESULTS Complications occurred in 110 (3.7%) and 24 (4.3%) patients following LSG and LRYGBP, respectively (p = 0.9). No significant difference was found between the groups regarding overall and complication-grade-specific rates. Individual complication types were unevenly distributed, but not significantly so. Patients with complications were older than those without (47 and 43 years, respectively; p = 0.01). Gender was not a risk factor for complication. Median LOS and readmission rates were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS LSG and LRYGBP are equally safe, at least in the perioperative period. Acknowledging and conveying this finding to surgeons and patients alike is important and might cause a pendulum shift in the distribution of bariatric procedures performed.","Goitein, David; Raziel, Asnat; Szold, Amir; Sakran, Nasser",Surgical endoscopy,201,24

The motion estimate is used to adapt the radiation beam to the current anatomy, yielding a more conformal dose distribution. As the MR acquisition is the largest component of latency, deep learning (DL) may reduce the total latency by enabling much higher undersampling factors compared to conventional reconstruction and motion estimation methods. The benefit of DL on image reconstruction and motion estimation was investigated for obtaining accurate deformation vector fields (DVFs) with high temporal resolution and minimal latency.Methods: 2D cine MRI acquired at 1.5T from 135 abdominal cancer patients were retrospectively included in this study. Undersampled radial golden angle acquisitions were retrospectively simulated. DVFs were computed using different combinations of conventional- and DL-based methods for image reconstruction and motion estimation, allowing a comparison of four approaches to achieve real-time motion estimation. The four approaches were evaluated based on the end-point-error and root-mean-square error compared to a ground-truth optical flow estimate on fully-sampled images, the structural similarity (SSIM) after registration and time necessary to acquire k-space, reconstruct an image and estimate motion.Results: The lowest DVF error and highest SSIM were obtained using conventional methods up to R≤10. For undersampling factors R>10, the lowest DVF error and highest SSIM were obtained using conventional image reconstruction and DL-based motion estimation. We have found that, with this combination, accurate DVFs can be obtained up to R=25 with an average root-mean-square error up to 1 millimeter and an SSIM greater than 0.8 after registration, taking 60 milliseconds.Conclusion: High-quality 2D DVFs from highly undersampled k-space can be obtained with a high temporal resolution with conventional image reconstruction and a deep learning-based motion estimation approach for real-time adaptive MRI-guided radiotherapy.","Terpstra, Maarten Lennart; Maspero, Matteo; D'Agata, Federico; Stemkens, Bjorn; Intven, Martijn P W; Lagendijk, Jan J W; Van den Berg, Cornelis A T; Tijssen, Rob H N",Physics in medicine and biology,201,17

STUDY DESIGN Retrospective case series. ANIMALS Dogs (n = 12). METHODS Dogs with open or closed-cervix pyometra with moderately sized (1-4 cm) uterine horn diameters based on preoperative ultrasonography and no evidence of perforation were included in the study. A 3-portal technique for LAOVH was used. A wound retraction device was inserted into the caudal portal after enlargement of the incision to 3-4 cm to simplify removal of the uterus with minimal tension. RESULTS Twelve dogs (median weight, 23.3 kg; range, 2.1-46.0 kg) met the inclusion criteria. Median uterine diameter was 3.0 cm (range, 1.2-4.0 cm). Median surgical time for LAOVH was 107 minutes (range, 82-120 minutes). Complications included mild hemorrhage from the uterine vessels in 1 dog during uterine removal through the wound retraction device and intra-abdominal uterine rupture in 1 dog which necessitated conversion to an open approach. All dogs recovered from surgery and were discharged. CONCLUSIONS LAOVH can be used for treatment of select cases of canine pyometra. Careful case selection is mandatory to improve success and minimize conversion to an open approach. Gentle handling of the reproductive organs is imperative to avoid iatrogenic uterine rupture.","Adamovich-Rippe, Krista N; Mayhew, Philipp D; Runge, Jeffrey J; Culp, William T N; Steffey, Michele A; Mayhew, Kelli N; Hunt, Geraldine B",Veterinary surgery : VS,201,1

The review was performed in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. The literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library and Web of Science and yielded 1304 results. 14 studies were included in the qualitative analysis. The reference standard for tumor infiltration was either histopathology or recurrence on image follow-up. Critical assessment was performed according to the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS2). All studies concluded their findings to be of significant value for future clinical practice. Diagnostic test accuracy reached an area under the curve of 0.74-0.91 reported in six studies. There was no consensus with regard to included image modalities, models or training and test strategies. The integration of artificial intelligence with multiparametric imaging shows promise for visualizing tumor cell infiltration in glioma patients.

High-performing and energy-efficient spin functionalities have been proposed, often relying on current-driven manipulation and detection of the spin states. In this regard, metallic vdW magnets are expected to have several advantages over the widely-studied insulating counterparts, but have not been much explored due to the lack of suitable materials. Here, we report tunable itinerant ferro- and antiferromagnetism in Co-doped Fe4GeTe2 utilizing the vdW interlayer coupling, extremely sensitive to the material composition. This leads to high TN antiferromagnetism of TN ~ 226 K in a bulk and ~210 K in 8 nm-thick nanoflakes, together with tunable magnetic anisotropy. The resulting spin configurations and orientations are sensitively controlled by doping, magnetic field, and thickness, which are effectively read out by electrical conduction. These findings manifest strong merits of metallic vdW magnets as an active component of vdW spintronic applications.","Seo, Junho; An, Eun Su; Park, Taesu; Hwang, Soo-Yoon; Kim, Gi-Yeop; Song, Kyung; Noh, Woo-Suk; Kim, J Y; Choi, Gyu Seung; Choi, Minhyuk; Oh, Eunseok; Watanabe, Kenji; Taniguchi, Takashi; Park, J -H; Jo, Youn Jung; Yeom, Han Woong; Choi, Si-Young; Shim, Ji Hoon; Kim, Jun Sung",Nature communications,201,17

Here, we investigated SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S)-reactive CD4+ T cells in peripheral blood of patients with COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2-unexposed healthy donors (HD). We detected SARS-CoV-2 S-reactive CD4+ T cells in 83% of patients with COVID-19 but also in 35% of HD. S-reactive CD4+ T cells in HD reacted primarily to C-terminal S epitopes, which show a higher homology to spike glycoproteins of human endemic coronaviruses, compared to N-terminal epitopes. S-reactive T cell lines generated from SARS-CoV-2-naive HD responded similarly to C-terminal S of human endemic coronaviruses 229E and OC43 and SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating the presence of S-cross-reactive T cells, probably generated during past encounters with endemic coronaviruses. The role of pre-existing SARS-CoV-2 cross-reactive T cells for clinical outcomes remains to be determined in larger cohorts. However, the presence of S-cross-reactive T cells in a sizable fraction of the general population may affect the dynamics of the current pandemic, and has important implications for the design and analysis of upcoming COVID-19 vaccine trials.","Braun, Julian; Loyal, Lucie; Frentsch, Marco; Wendisch, Daniel; Georg, Philipp; Kurth, Florian; Hippenstiel, Stefan; Dingeldey, Manuela; Kruse, Beate; Fauchere, Florent; Baysal, Emre; Mangold, Maike; Henze, Larissa; Lauster, Roland; Mall, Marcus A; Beyer, Kirsten; Röhmel, Jobst; Voigt, Sebastian; Schmitz, Jürgen; Miltenyi, Stefan; Demuth, Ilja; Müller, Marcel A; Hocke, Andreas; Witzenrath, Martin; Suttorp, Norbert; Kern, Florian; Reimer, Ulf; Wenschuh, Holger; Drosten, Christian; Corman, Victor M; Giesecke-Thiel, Claudia; Sander, Leif Erik; Thiel, Andreas",Nature,201,5

Because of this, it is important to investigate COVID-19 mortality and its predictors in one of the most densely populated regions of the country, the Silesian Voivodeship. OBJECTIVE The goal of this study was to assess the level of in-hospital mortality due to COVID-19 as well as the impact of sex, age, and coexisting diseases on the risk of death. PATIENTS AND METHODS Data analysis was based on discharge reports of COVID-19 patients hospitalized between March and June 2020 in all hospitals in the region. Age, sex, hospital discharge status, and the presence of coexisting diseases were abstracted from the charts. RESULTS In a group of 2830 COVID-19 in-patients, 325 died during hospitalization. COVID-19 deaths were associated with male sex (OR (Odds ratio), 1.52; 95%CI, 1.17-1.96), older age (OR, 6.11; 95%CI, 4.50-8.31), and the presence of three or more coexisting diseases (OR, 4.78; 95%CI, 3.52 - 6.49). The most prevalent coexisting diseases were chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. CONCLUSION The estimated in-hospital fatality ratio of COVID-19 was 11.5% and is smaller than the average COVID-19 fatality ratio in other European countries. The risk of in-hospital was associated with sex, age, and the number of coexisting diseases such as chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.","Kowalska, Małgorzata; Barański, Kamil; Brożek, Grzegorz; Kaleta-Pilarska, Angelina; Zejda, Jan E",Polish archives of internal medicine,201,12

Digital health technology, including body-worn devices, offers a solution using digital outcomes to measure and monitor disease status and provide outcomes meaningful to both patients and health care professionals. Remote monitoring of physical mobility is a prime example, because mobility is among the most advanced modalities that can be assessed digitally and remotely. Loss of mobility is also an important feature of many health conditions, providing a read-out of health as well as a target for intervention. Real-world, continuous digital measures of mobility (digital mobility outcomes or DMOs) provide an opportunity for novel insights into health care conditions complementing existing mobility measures. Accepted and approved DMOs are not yet widely available. The need for large collaborative efforts to tackle the critical steps to adoption is widely recognised. Mobilise-D is an example. It is a multidisciplinary consortium of 34 institutions from academia and industry funded through the European Innovative Medicines Initiative 2 Joint Undertaking. Members of Mobilise-D are collaborating to address the critical steps for DMOs to be adopted in clinical trials and ultimately health care. To achieve this, the consortium has developed a roadmap to inform the development, validation and approval of DMOs in Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and recovery from proximal femoral fracture. Here we aim to describe the proposed approach and provide a high-level view of the ongoing and planned work of the Mobilise-D consortium. Ultimately, Mobilise-D aims to stimulate widespread adoption of DMOs through the provision of device agnostic software, standards and robust validation in order to bring digital outcomes from concept to use in clinical trials and health care.","Rochester, Lynn; Mazzà, Claudia; Mueller, Arne; Caulfield, Brian; McCarthy, Marie; Becker, Clemens; Miller, Ram; Piraino, Paolo; Viceconti, Marco; Dartee, Wilhelmus P; Garcia-Aymerich, Judith; Aydemir, Aida A; Vereijken, Beatrix; Arnera, Valdo; Ammour, Nadir; Jackson, Michael; Hache, Tilo; Roubenoff, Ronenn",Digital biomarkers,201,33

To date, no commercial vaccines are available for control of the disease. In the present study, we isolated a field strain (NC1743) of TCoV and evaluated its pathogenicity in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) turkey poults to establish a TCoV disease model. The results showed that the TCoV NC1743 isolate was pathogenic to turkey poults with a minimal infectious dose at 106 EID50/bird. About 50 % of one-day-old SPF turkeys infected with the virus's minimal infectious dose exhibited typical enteric disease signs and lesions from 6 days post-infection (dpi) to the end of the experiment (21 dpi). In contrast, fewer than 20 % of older turkeys (1- or 2-week-old) infected with the same amount of TCoV displayed enteric disease signs, which disappeared after 15-18 dpi. Although all infected turkeys, regardless of age, shed TCoV, the older turkeys shed less virus than the younger birds, and 50 % of the 2-week-old birds even cleared the virus at 21 dpi. Furthermore, the viral infection caused day-old turkeys more body-weight-gain reduction than older birds. The overall data demonstrated that the TCoV NC1743 isolate is a highly pathogenic strain and younger turkeys are more susceptible to TCoV infection than older birds. Thus, one-day-old turkeys infected with the minimal infectious dose of TCoV NC1743 could be used as a TCoV disease model to study the disease pathogenesis, and the TCoV NC1743 strain could be used as a challenge virus to evaluate a vaccine protective efficacy.","Kang, Kyung-Il; Day, J Michael; Eldemery, Fatma; Yu, Qingzhong",Veterinary microbiology,201,31

The goal of this study is to assess SE of PGY5 residents for common general surgery operations. We hypothesize there are deficits in SE of PGY5 residents, and SE of a given operation correlates with 1) experience performing the operation without attending assistance (independently) and/or 2) teaching the operation start-to-finish. METHODS A survey was linked to the 2020 ABSITE. From the ACGME case log's 15 most commonly performed surgeon-chief operations and AHRQ's 15 most common operations, 10 operations were selected. Residents evaluated their ability to perform these operations independently using a 5-point SE scale. Residents were asked if they had experience performing these operations independently and/or teaching the operation start-to-finish. Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation were used to examine the relationship between SE and operative experience. RESULTS 1145 of 1367 (84%) PGY5 residents responded. Highest SE was in performing wide-local excision (90.24%) and the lowest in performing open thyroidectomy (19.58%) (Table 1). Eighty-eight (7.7%) reported SE in all procedures. Statistically significant positive correlations were identified between experience and SE for cases performed without assistance (r = 0.98, p<0.01) and cases taught (r = 0.91, p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS With 5 months left in training, 92.3% of residents report deficits in preparation for practice as defined by SE to complete common procedures independently.

There is a marked paucity of articles detailing the CXR findings vis-à-vis a multitude of articles dedicated to the CT features of COVID-19. The purpose of this article is to describe the morphological and distributional patterns of the lung opacities in CXR and to classify the spectrum of essential features on portable AP chest radiographs of PCR-positive COVID-19 patients admitted in a tertiary care hospital in Scandinavia. To our knowledge, this is the first article to describe the morphological and topographical features of CXRs in COVID-19-positive cases. METHODS A retrospective analysis of twenty (20) RT-PCR-positive COVID-19 patients admitted to the hospital between 12.03.2020 to 10.04.2020 was done in this study. Morphology and distribution of the opacities were reviewed by two senior consultants and analysed for patterns. RESULTS Most patients had ground-glass opacities (80-85%) and interspersed interstitial opacities (70-75%), often with a characteristic appearance. The opacities were mostly bilateral (80%) and distributed in the lower zones (and to some extent mid zones) and in the middle and peripheral regions, with a tendency to merge towards the hilar areas. There were high interobserver agreements among various parameters and no significant statistical difference between observer 1 and 2. CONCLUSION Chest radiographics show characteristic patterns and distributions, which can be used as an adjunct in the diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19 patients in specific clinical contexts.","Bharadwaz, Arindam; Langfeldt, Sten",Journal of medical imaging and radiation oncology,201,27

Two modules compose the presented plugin: the simulation module implements a discrete version of the Rayleigh-Somerfield diffraction formula, which allows the user to directly build a simulated hologram from a known phase and/or amplitude object by just introducing the geometry parameters of the simulated setup; the plugin's reconstruction module implements a discrete version of the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz diffraction integral, thus allowing the user to reconstruct DLHM holograms by introducing the parameters of the acquisition setup and the desired reconstruction distance. The plugin offers the two said modules within the robust environment provided by a complete set of built-in tools for image processing available in ImageJ. While the simulation module has been validated through the evaluation of the forecasted lateral resolution of a DLHM setup in terms of the numerical aperture, the reconstruction module is tested by means of reconstructing experimental DLHM holograms of biological samples.","Trujillo, Carlos; Piedrahita-Quintero, Pablo; Garcia-Sucerquia, Jorge",Applied optics,201,25

More than 15% of adolescents have a body mass index (BMI) higher than the 95th percentile. The use of surgical strategies in adolescent patients is still controversial due to the impact on the continuing maturing process. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) is considered a minimal invasive procedure that does not alter the physiological behavior of the bowel and has already shown promising results in short-term studies. METHODS Between 1998 and 2004, 50 adolescent patients above the 99.5th age- and gender-adjusted growing percentile were treated with LAGB. The surgical procedure was performed at three highly experienced centers for bariatric surgery. Mean age was 17.1 ± 2.2 years (range = 9-19 years) at the time of surgery. Follow-up investigations were performed in the outpatient clinic of the treating hospitals. Psychological changes were analyzed using the BAROS questionnaire. RESULTS The mean BMI decreased from 45.2 ± 7.6 kg/m(2) at the time of surgery to 38.3 ± 6.2 kg/m(2) 1 year after surgery, 31.5 ± 6.6 kg/m(2) after 3 years, and 27.3 ± 5.3 kg/m(2) after 5 years. Mean excessive weight loss was 49.7 ± 29.2, 76.8 ± 27.5, and 92.6 ± 24.5% at 1, 3, and 5 years after surgery. Quality of life showed a further significant improvement between 3 and 5 years after surgery (BAROS: 5.5 ± 1.9 increased to 6.3 ± 2.2, p = 0.01). All preoperative comorbidities resolved in patients with a functional band after 5 years of follow-up. CONCLUSION LAGB shows promising results in the long-term follow-up with continuous weight loss in patients with a functional band. Nevertheless, most of the weight loss is within the first 3 years after surgery. Thereafter, further weight reduction is about 10% over the following 2 years. Perioperative comorbidities resolve within the first 5 years after treatment.","Silberhumer, Gerd R; Miller, Karl; Pump, Antonia; Kriwanek, Stefan; Widhalm, Kurt; Gyoeri, Georg; Prager, Gerhard",Surgical endoscopy,201,1

The gradient experiments were established to evaluate the feasibility of adding different content of PEG-600 to the biofilter for enhancing toluene removal. In particular, the evolution trend of microbial community embedded in packing fillers was measured by 16S rRNA-based gene sequencing. Results showed that the toluene removal efficiency of biofilter with 7.5% adding content of the PEG-600 was greatly improved, and the maximum elimination capacity of 152 g/(m3·h) was obtained. The introduction of PEG-600 enhanced the tolerance ability to withstand the transient impact loading and intensified the production of extracellular polymeric substances and bonding strength of biofilms. It should be noted that the abundance of Pseudomonas and Steroidobacter at genus level increased significantly.

Results: At the early use of ICIs, compared with those with active AID, grade 3-4 AID flare occurred more frequently in patients with inactive AID after treatment with ICIs; and the incidence of grade 3-4 immunotoxic effects was significantly lower in patients undergoing immunosuppressive therapy than those without corresponding treatment. In addition, patients with worsening AID generally obtained a better objective response than those without a flare. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the toxic effects induced by immunotherapy are generally manageable in patients with cancer and pre-existing AID, some of whom even achieve satisfactory antitumor effects in clinical practice.","Wu, Chunlan; Zhong, Li; Wu, Qing; Lin, Shaowei; Xie, Xianhe",Immunotherapy,201,1

Methods: We conducted an observational descriptive study of all patients with COVID-19 in our health area diagnosed between 2020/03/10 and 2020/04/14. Factors related to smell and taste disorders were analysed. Results: A total of 126 patients, 63 women and 63 men, aged 16-80 years, were included. As many as 69 patients (62.7%) presented hyposmia, and 58 (46%) of them had anosmia. A total of 75 patients (59.5%) presented hypogeusia, and 57 (45.2%) of them had ageusia. The risk factors that were most commonly associated with these disorders were the female sex (adjusted odds ratio, aOR 2.43 for smell disorders and 2.44 for taste disorders), allergic rhinitis (aOR 3.34 for smell disorders) and a younger age. A protective factor was arterial hypertension (aOR 0.51 for smell disorders and 0.35 for taste disorders). A history of tonsillectomy was the risk factor for taste disorder (aOR 5.23). Conclusion: Our results indicate that these sensory disorders occurred more frequently in female patients and in young patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 infection who progressed with mild nasal congestion, posterior rhinorrhoea and without anterior rhinorrhoea. The recovery of taste occurred before the recovery of smell.","Guillén Martínez, Alberto; Andreu Gálvez, Marina; Rodríguez Sanz, Sara; Hernández Ruiz, Paula; García Morillas, Antonio; Esteban Sánchez, Tomás",Otolaryngologia polska = The Polish otolaryngology,201,27

The increasing number of critically ill patients and deaths have fueled a desperate search for treatments that can halt the course of the disease. Currently, there are several experimental therapies with demonstrated in vitro activity against COVID-19 used in clinical practice, including hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, interleukin-6 pathway inhibitors, and convalescent plasma; however, to date no agent has proven efficacy against COVID-19. In the case of convalescent plasma, this therapy consists in obtaining neutralizing antibodies from previously infected individuals by plasmapheresis and administering them to patients with severe disease. Recently, the use of convalescent plasma has shown promising results in preliminary studies, with case series reporting a decrease in temperature, and viral load, as well as improvement in clinical parameters among patients receiving this treatment. However, there are still unmet needs regarding the safety profile, tolerability, dosage, and timing this therapy should be given. Based on this, the objective of our study was to develop and propose a practical approach for the compassionate use of convalescent plasma for the treatment of patients with severe COVID-19, given the constrains and limitations of developing countries.

Not just yet.,20.249277,8.465717,2021-01-01,"OBJECTIVES We describe a new procedure for aspiration called tubed supraglottoplasty (TS). TS is a transoral procedure that approximates the aryepiglottic (AE) folds and arytenoids. This narrows the laryngeal inlet. This procedure has been used to improve swallowing and reduce aspiration in patients with vocal fold paralysis. We describe the technical aspects of TS and report on 11 patients. METHODS TS is done by oral intubation followed by suspension laryngoscopy. An incision is made along the AE fold into the posterior commissure and then continued to the opposite AE fold. Dissection within this incision creates two mucosal flaps, one based on the laryngeal surface and the other on the pharyngeal surface. Two 1-cm releasing incisions are made at each end of the AE fold. The laryngeal mucosal flap is approximated using a 3-0 self-locking running suture. The pharyngeal mucosal flap is approximated as a second layer. This double-layered mucosal V-Y advancement flap builds up the posterior laryngeal height. It narrows and ""tubes"" the supraglottis. RESULTS All patients tolerated TS without airway complications. Ten of the 11 patients reported improved swallowing function with less aspiration. Six of the 8 patients with prior G-tubes had their gastrostomy tube removed. Postoperative laryngoscopy showed a narrowed ""tubed"" supraglottis with a higher posterior wall preventing spillover and aspiration. An improved Functional Oral Intake Scale was recorded in ten of eleven patients. CONCLUSION TS is a minimally invasive procedure that can improve swallowing and reduce aspiration.","Ma, Yue; Naunheim, Matthew R; Gregory, Jill; Woo, Peak","The Annals of otology, rhinology, and laryngology",201,31

This paper describes the impact of sedentarism on the human body at the level of the muscular, cardiovascular, metabolic, endocrine and nervous systems and is based on evidence from several models of inactivity, including bed rest, unilateral limb suspension, and step-reduction. Data form these studies show that muscle wasting occurs rapidly, being detectable within two days of inactivity. This loss of muscle mass is associated with fibre denervation, neuromuscular junction damage and upregulation of protein breakdown, but is mostly explained by the suppression of muscle protein synthesis. Inactivity also affects glucose homeostasis as just few days of step reduction or bed rest, reduce insulin sensitivity, principally in muscle. Additionally, aerobic capacity is impaired at all levels of the O2 cascade, from the cardiovascular system, including peripheral circulation, to skeletal muscle oxidative function. Positive energy balance during physical inactivity is associated with fat deposition, associated with systemic inflammation and activation of antioxidant defences, exacerbating muscle loss. Importantly, these deleterious effects of inactivity can be diminished by routine exercise practice, but the exercise dose-response relationship is currently unknown. Nevertheless, low to medium-intensity high volume resistive exercise, easily implementable in home-settings, will have positive effects, particularly if combined with a 15-25% reduction in daily energy intake. This combined regimen seems ideal for preserving neuromuscular, metabolic and cardiovascular health.Highlights This paper describes the impact of sedentarism, caused by the COVID-19 home confinement on the neuromuscular, cardiovascular, metabolic and endocrine systems.Just few days of sedentary lifestyle are sufficient to induce muscle loss, neuromuscular junction damage and fibre denervation, insulin resistance, decreased aerobic capacity, fat deposition and low-grade systemic inflammation.Regular low/medium intensity high volume exercise, together with a 15-25% reduction in caloric intake are recommended for preserving neuromuscular, cardiovascular, metabolic and endocrine health.","Narici, Marco; De Vito, Giuseppe; Franchi, Martino; Paoli, Antonio; Moro, Tatiana; Marcolin, Giuseppe; Grassi, Bruno; Baldassarre, Giovanni; Zuccarelli, Lucrezia; Biolo, Gianni; di Girolamo, Filippo Giorgio; Fiotti, Nicola; Dela, Flemming; Greenhaff, Paul; Maganaris, Constantinos",European journal of sport science,201,16

In this time academic research has grown our understanding of MSC biochemistry and our ability to manipulate these cells in vitro using chemical, biomaterial, and mechanical methods. Research has been emboldened by the promise that MSCs can treat illness and repair damaged tissues through their capacity for immunomodulation and differentiation. Since 1995, 31 therapeutic products containing MSCs and/or progenitors have reached the market with the level of in vitro manipulation varying significantly. In this review, we summarise existing therapeutic products containing MSCs or mesenchymal progenitor cells and examine the challenges faced when developing new therapeutic products. Successful progression to clinical trial, and ultimately market, requires a thorough understanding of these hurdles at the earliest stages of in vitro pre-clinical development. It is beneficial to understand the health economic benefit for a new product and the reimbursement potential within various healthcare systems. Pre-clinical studies should be selected to demonstrate efficacy and safety for the specific clinical indication in humans, to avoid duplication of effort and minimise animal usage. Early consideration should also be given to manufacturing: how cell manipulation methods will integrate into highly controlled workflows and how they will be scaled up to produce clinically relevant quantities of cells.

Individuals with underlying systemic diseases are more prone and vulnerable to suffer severe consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. The pathophysiological changes identified cytokine storm mechanism for out setting the series of adverse clinical conditions. Thereby, associating it with high mortality rates. This warrants urgent consideration of divergent modalities such as the cellular therapy. Cellular therapy (CT) is a new medical paradigm wherein cellular material is administered to patients for therapeutic purposes. In this regard, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have yielded the most promising results among stromal vascular fraction (SVF); placental cells; natural killer (NK) cell and platelet lysate respectively. Following the administration of the CT as per preferred route, these play pivotal role in modifying the microenvironment of the lung tissue with their distinct sets of mechanism.

However, data on asymptomatic identification rates of respiratory viruses are limited, particularly in Indigenous populations, who suffer a high burden of OM. METHODS We describe the identification of respiratory viruses alone and in combination with pathogenic OM bacteria in 1006 nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from asymptomatic Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children in a longitudinal community-based cohort study in rural Western Australia. RESULTS Viruses were identified in 42% of samples from Aboriginal and 32% from non-Aboriginal children. Rhinoviruses were the most frequently identified virus with higher identification rates in Aboriginal (23.6%) than non-Aboriginal children (16.5%; P = 0.003). Rhinoviruses were associated with H. influenzae (odds ratio [OR], 2.24; 95% CI, 1.24-4.07 for Aboriginal children) and M. catarrhalis (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.05-3.57 for Aboriginal children).

We evaluated perioperative risk prediction tools relevant to an Australian context. METHODS A systematic review of perioperative mortality risk prediction tools used for adults undergoing inpatient noncardiac surgery, published between 2011 and 2019 (following an earlier systematic review). We searched Medline via OVID using medical subject headings consistent with the three main areas of risk, surgery and mortality/morbidity. A similar search was conducted in Embase. Tools predicting morbidity but not mortality were excluded, as were those predicting a composite outcome that did not report predictive performance for mortality separately. Tools were also excluded if they were specifically designed for use in cardiac or other highly specialized surgery, emergency surgery, paediatrics or elderly patients. RESULTS Literature search identified 2568 studies for screening, of which 19 studies identified 21 risk prediction tools for inclusion. CONCLUSION Four tools are candidates for adapting in the Australian context, including the Surgical Mortality Probability Model (SMPM), Preoperative Score to Predict Postoperative Mortality (POSPOM), Surgical Outcome Risk Tool (SORT) and NZRISK. SORT has similar predictive performance to POSPOM, using only six variables instead of 17, contains all variables of the SMPM, and the original model developed in the UK has already been successfully adapted in New Zealand as NZRISK. Collecting the SORT and NZRISK variables in a national surgical outcomes study in Australia would present an opportunity to simultaneously investigate three of our four shortlisted models and to develop a locally valid perioperative mortality risk prediction model with high predictive performance.","Reilly, Jennifer R; Gabbe, Belinda J; Brown, Wendy A; Hodgson, Carol L; Myles, Paul S",ANZ journal of surgery,201,19

This study aims to understand differential post-operative changes in eyelid contour for MMCR and ELR surgery. METHODS In this cross-sectional cohort study, patients affected by involutional ptosis were randomized into two groups: those who underwent ELR or MMCR surgery. Pre-operative and late post-operative photographs were obtained. Digital analysis of the lid contour was performed by measuring the vertical distance from a line intersecting the center of the pupil to the eyelid margin at 10 positions at 2 mm intervals. Mean distance at each position was compared pre- and post-operatively between the groups. RESULTS The final sample included 60 eyes from 39 patients, 30 eyes per group. At each time point there was significant variation in height across the eyelid (p < 0.05). A significant (p < 0.05) group difference in vertical height was noted only at the 2 and 4 mm temporal positions in the post-operative analysis, with the ELR group being slightly higher. There were no significant differences in MRD1, pre- or post-operatively, between the ELR and MMCR groups.

However, the mechanism and the type of myocardial damage associated with SARS-CoV-2 remain uncertain. Methods: We conducted a systematic pathologic analysis of 40 hearts from hospitalized patients dying of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Bergamo, Italy to determine the pathologic mechanisms of cardiac injury. We divided the hearts according to presence or absence of acute myocyte necrosis and then determined the underlying mechanisms of cardiac injury. Results: Of the 40 hearts examined, 14 (35%) had evidence of myocyte necrosis, predominantly of the left ventricle. As compared to subjects without necrosis, subjects with necrosis tended to be female, have chronic kidney disease, and shorter symptom onset to admission. The incidence of severe coronary artery disease (i.e., >75% cross sectional narrowing) was not significantly different between those with and without necrosis. 3/14 (21 .4%) subjects with myocyte necrosis showed evidence of acute myocardial infarction defined as ≥1 cm2 area of necrosis while 11/14 (78.6%) showed evidence of focal (> 20 necrotic myocytes with an area of ≥ 0.05 mm2 but <1 cm2) myocyte necrosis. Cardiac thrombi were present in 11/14 (78.6%) cases with necrosis, with 2/14 (14.2%) having epicardial coronary artery thrombi while 9/14 (64.3%) had microthrombi in myocardial capillaries, arterioles, and small muscular arteries. We compared cardiac microthrombi from COVID-19 positive autopsy cases to intramyocardial thromboemboli from COVID-19 cases as well as to aspirated thrombi obtained during primary percutaneous coronary intervention from uninfected and COVID-19 infected patients presenting with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Microthrombi had significantly greater fibrin and terminal complement C5b-9 immunostaining as compared to intramyocardial thromboemboli from COVID-19 negative subjects and to aspirated thrombi. There were no significant differences between the constituents of thrombi aspirated from COVID-19 positive and negative STEMI patients. Conclusions: The most common pathologic cause of myocyte necrosis was microthrombi. Microthrombi were different in composition as compared to intramyocardial thromboemboli from COVID-19 negative subjects and to coronary thrombi retrieved from COVID-19 positive and negative STEMI patients. Tailored anti-thrombotic strategies may be useful to counteract the cardiac effects of COVID-19 infection.","Pellegrini, Dario; Kawakami, Rika; Guagliumi, Giulio; Sakamoto, Atsushi; Kawai, Kenji; Gianatti, Andrea; Nasr, Ahmed; Kutys, Robert; Guo, Liang; Cornelissen, Anne; Faggi, Lara; Mori, Masayuki; Sato, Yu; Pescetelli, Irene; Brivio, Matteo; Romero, Maria; Virmani, Renu; Finn, Aloke V",Circulation,201,1

Unfortunately, institution of enteral feeding in both groups of patients often has to be postponed due to delayed gastric emptying and the need for gastric decompression. The design of current polyvinylchloride (PVC) gastric decompression tubes (Salem Sump [Covidien, Mansfield, MA] in the United States; Ryles [Penine Health Care Ltd, Derby, UK] in the United Kingdom and Europe) make them unsuitable for their subsequent use as either nasogastric enteral feeding tubes or for continued gastric decompression during postpyloric enteral feeding. To overcome these problems, we have designed a range of polyurethane (PU) dual-purpose gastric decompression and enteral feeding tubes that include 2 nasogastric tubes (double lumen to replace Salem Sump; single lumen to replace Ryles). Two novel multilumen nasogastrojejunal tubes (triple lumen for the United States; double lumen for the United Kingdom and Europe) complete the range. By using PU, a given internal diameter (ID) and flow area can be incorporated into a lower outside diameter (OD) compared with that achieved with PVC. The ID and lumen and flow area of an 18Fr (OD 6.7 mm) PVC Salem Sump can be incorporated into a 14Fr (OD 4.7 mm) PU tube. The design of aspiration/infusion ports of current PVC and PU tubes invites occlusion by gastrointestinal mucosa and clogging by mucus and enteral feed. To overcome this, we have designed long, single, widened, smooth, and curved edge ports with no ""dead space"" to trap mucus or curdled diet. Involving up to 214° of the circumference, these ports have up to 11 times the flow areas of the aspiration ports of current PVC tubes. CONCLUSION The proposed designs will lead to the development of dual-purpose nasogastric and nasojejunal tubes that will significantly improve the clinical and nutrition care of postoperative and ICU patients.","Silk, David B A; Quinn, David G",JPEN.

However, ACTs also represent a distinct manufacturing challenge because the independent manufacture and subsequent mixing of monoclonal antibodies quickly becomes cost prohibitive as more complex mixtures are envisioned. We have developed a virus-free recombinant protein expression platform based on adeno-associated viral (AAV) elements that is capable of rapid and consistent production of complex antibody mixtures in a single batch format. Using both multiplexed immunoassays and cation exchange (CIEX) chromatography, cell culture supernatants generated using our system were assessed for stability of expression and ratios of the component antibodies over time. Cultures expressing combinations of three to ten antibodies maintained consistent expression levels and stable ratios of component antibodies for at least 60 days. Cultures showed remarkable reproducibility following cell banking, and AAV-based cultures showed higher stability and productivity than non-AAV based cultures. Therefore, this non-viral AAV-based expression platform represents a predictable, reproducible, quick and cost effective method to manufacture or quickly produce for preclinical testing recombinant antibody combination therapies and other recombinant protein mixtures.","Wilmes, Gwendolyn M; Carey, Kimberly L; Hicks, Stuart W; Russell, Hugh H; Stevenson, Jesse A; Kocjan, Paulina; Lutz, Stephen R; Quesenberry, Rachel S; Shulga-Morskoy, Sergey V; Lewis, Megan E; Clark, Ethan; Medik, Violetta; Cooper, Anthony B; Reczek, Elizabeth E",mAbs,201,1

African Americans are more likely to contract COVID-19, develop complications and die from the virus. Amid the growing research on COVID-19, this manuscript pays particular attention to African American women who are disproportionately represented as 'essential' or frontline workers, yet often lack job security and risk contagion. Faced with limited testing centers, they are also at risk of having their symptoms minimized or dismissed by medical practitioners even when they show visible symptoms of COVID-19. METHODS Using the theoretical framework of intersectionality developed by scholars like Kimberlé Crenshaw and Patricia Hill Collins, this manuscript examines the impact of COVID-19 on African American women. It emphasizes that African American women are vulnerable to COVID-19 due to the twin legacies of racism and sexism. Intersectionality theory espouses that racism and sexism often combine with social determinants of health such as economic stability and socio-environmental factors to shape health outcomes. Within the context of COVID-19, this work underscores that African American women are susceptible to the virus due to their higher likelihood of co-morbidities like obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure. They are also likely to face eviction and homelessness if they are laid off or furloughed as a result of the pandemic. CONCLUSION This manuscript asserts that decades of racism and discrimination have isolated communities of color and made them particularly vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus. As many African American women deal with unemployment or continue to work as 'essential workers', the intersectionality framework sheds light on the continued legacies of racism and sexism. It asserts that targeted policy interventions are needed to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 and lessen the devastating impact(s) it has had on African American communities.","Obinna, Denise N",Ethnicity & health,201,1

We examined if exposure to such claims was associated with changes in tobacco and alcohol consumption. METHODS We conducted a population-based, landline and mobile phone survey of 1501 randomly sampled adults aged 18 years or older (47.5% male) in Hong Kong in April 2020. Respondents reported if they had ever seen claims that 'smoking/alcohol drinking can protect against COVID-19' from popular social networking platforms. Current tobacco and alcohol users reported if they had increased or reduced their consumption since the outbreak. Prevalence data were weighted by sex, age and education of the general adult population. RESULTS 19.0% (95% CI 16.8% to 21.4%) of all respondents reported having seen claims that 'smoking/alcohol drinking can protect against COVID-19' from social networking sites. Multinomial logistic regression showed that exposure to the claims was significantly associated with increased tobacco use (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.08 to 5.20) in current tobacco users (N=280) and increased alcohol use (OR 4.16, 95% CI 2.00 to 8.67) in current drinkers (N=722), adjusting for sex, age, education level, alcohol/tobacco use status, home isolation, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and survey method. CONCLUSION Our results first showed that exposure to health misinformation that smoking/alcohol drinking can protect against COVID-19 was associated with self-reported increases in tobacco and alcohol consumption in Chinese during the pandemic.","Luk, Tzu Tsun; Zhao, Shengzhi; Weng, Xue; Wong, Janet Yuen-Ha; Wu, Yongda Socrates; Ho, Sai Yin; Lam, Tai Hing; Wang, Man Ping",Tobacco control,201,30

To identify ""high-stress"" workers, the Brief Job Stress Questionnaire (BJSQ) is recommended. According to the stress check program manual issued by the government, high-stress can be defined using two criteria, either the ""sum method"" (simply summing the scores for each scales) or the ""score converted method"" (using converted scores according to the conversion table for each scales). In this study, we examined the differences in results found using these two criteria on ""stress check program"" data. METHODS We used data of 71,422 workers in 117 companies and organizations who conducted stress checks in 2016. The prevalence of high-stress was calculated by applying the two criteria simultaneously, and the chi-square test was used to compare the proportion of workers with high-stress. We subsequently divided participants into the four following groups and calculated the proportion of each group: group A was defined as having high-stress by both criteria; group B, only by the sum method; group C, only by the score converted method; and group D, not defined as high-stress by either criterion. We compared the average values of stress response among four groups using the Kruskal-Wallis test, and further compared the average values between group B and group C using the Bonferroni method. RESULTS The average age of participants was 43.7 ± 11.1, and 66.8% were males. The proportion of those defined as having high-stress were 11.7% using the sum method and 13.2% using the score converted method; the proportion of high-stress workers was thus significantly higher when using the score converted method (p <.001). Physical stress response was higher in group B; however, lack of vigor, irritation, fatigue, and depression were higher in group C (p <.01). CONCLUSIONS Compared to the sum method, 1.5% more high-stress workers were observed using the converted method, and this result was similar for individual and employment-related factors. Furthermore, workers were more likely to be judged as having ""high-stress"" when the score of the physical stress response was higher in the sum method. Hereafter, it is important to consider which criteria are applied when discussing proportions of high-stress. Further research is needed to examine which criteria will predict health disorders.","Kataoka, Aoi; Kikuchi, Hiroyuki; Odagiri, Yuko; Ohya, Yumiko; Nakanishi, Yutaka; Shimomitsu, Teruichi; Inoue, Shigeru",Sangyo eiseigaku zasshi = Journal of occupational health,201,31

Community health workers use a door-to-door delivery strategy to treat children with SMC drugs, but for SMC to be as effective as in clinical trials, coverage must be high over successive seasons. Methods We used a microplanning model that utilizes raster to estimate population size, generates optimal households visit itinerary, and quantifies SMC coverage based on CHWs time investment. CHWs performance under current SMC deployment mode was assessed and compared to microplanning. Results Estimates showed that microplanning significantly reduces CHWs walking distance by 25%, increases visited households by 36% (p < 0.001) and increases SMC coverage by 21% (37.3% under current SMC deployment mode up to 58.3% under microplanning, p < 0.001). Optimal visit itinerary alone increased SMC coverage up to 100% in small villages whereas in larger or hard-to-reach villages, filling the gap additionally needed an optimization of the CHW ratio. Conclusion We estimate that for a pair of CHWs, the daily optimal number of visited children and walking distance should not exceed 45 and 5km respectively.

A survey conducted in February 2020 in the United States examined factors affecting information sharing behaviors and social amplification or attenuation of risk on Twitter among U.S. citizens at the early stage of the COVID-19 outbreak. Building on the social amplification of risk framework (SARF), the study suggests the importance of factors such as online discussion, information seeking behaviors, blame and anger, trust in various types of Twitter accounts and misinformation concerns in influencing the spread of risk information during the incipient stages of a crisis when the publics rely primarily on social media for information. An attenuation of risk was found among the US public, as indicated by the overall low sharing behaviors. Findings also imply that (dis)trust and misinformation concerns on social media sources, and inconsistencies in early risk messaging may have contributed to the attenuation of risk and low risk knowledge among the US publics at the early stage of the outbreak, further problematizing subsequent risk communication efforts.","Zhang, Xiaochen Angela Cozma Raluca",Computers in Human Behavior,201,24

As our tertiary-care medical center's screening program provides SM at four sites across our metropolitan area, we examined whether sites that historically served more patients from more disadvantaged areas returned slower to pre-COVID volumes. Methods: Patient records were linked by ZIP code of residence to ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA)-level area-based social metrics (ABSMs) from the 2014-2018 American Community Survey. We compared baseline pre-COVID (MayOctober, 2015-2019) SM population ABSMs between our four imaging sites for: % persons below poverty (≥ vs < 10%), % persons of color (POC) (quintiles: top 2 vs bottom 3), index of racialized economic segregation (quintiles: bottom 2 [more POC low-income households] vs top 3 [more white non-Hispanic (WNH) highincome households]);and race/ethnicity (% WNH vs POC). We modeled weekly SM volumes per screening day by site using Poisson regression and tested for weekly differences at each site, COVID-era (May-October 2020) vs preCOVID;and tested for monthly differences in SM population composition by logistic regression modeling. Results: There were 89,082 pre-COVID and 16,220 COVID-era SM exams. At pre-COVID baselines the four sites differed in population composition by ABSMs and race/ethnicity (all chi-square P values <.001) (Table). The two sites that served more disadvantaged populations (A, B) returned slower to pre-COVID volumes (site-specific weekly screening volume no longer different [P >.05] vs pre-COVID) (Table). As a result, compositions of the aggregate SM population across all sites showed a smaller proportion of patients from the most disadvantaged ZCTAs by ABSMs (all P values <.001) before returning to pre-COVID compositions three months after SM resumption. Conclusions: SM was slower to return to pre-COVID volumes at imaging sites that historically served lower-income communities of color. As a result, our COVIDera SM population skewed away from patients in disadvantaged ZCTAs. Our findings highlight the need to monitor for emergent disparities in the pandemic era. Future work will focus on understanding causes of inequitable SM engagement across our imaging sites to mitigate care disparities for our most vulnerable patients. (Table Presented).","Wang, G.

However, the extent to which the pandemic may have a lasting effect on people's daily life and work remains to be seen. Poor visual and acoustic quality of online meetings could reactivate old communication patterns in the long term. New technologies such as 6G and 3D holography, offering enhanced video quality and online experience, could further drive virtualization in communication. This article investigates the CO2 mitigation potential resulting from the partial replacement of business travel by 6G-enabled 3D videoconferencing in Germany in 2030. The carbon footprint calculation combined with scenario analysis has shown significant results when direct and indirect energy effects are considered. In the different scenarios investigated, a virtual conference would cause between 0.2% and 0.9% of the emissions of a mean-distance conference trip taken by a German business traveler. Considering the mitigation potential of all German conference travel in 2030, emissions could be decreased by 2.1 MtCO2eq (8.9%) and 20.5 MtCO2eq (88.4%), respectively, compared to 2019 under conservative and optimistic assumptions.

The assumption of perfect air-mixing in spaces is widely applied in prediction, which projects a single mean risk of infection in the space. Detailed distribution of infection risk, especially for large spaces such as large lecture hall, indoor stadium and ballroom, will be highly desired for evaluating indoor risks and improvement performance of mitigating strategies. This study developed new formulae for calculating the spatial distribution of infection risk, stemming from the original Wells?Riley model but integrating the spatial distribution of pathogen concentrations. Case studies were presented for two typical large public spaces (i.e. restaurant and ballroom). Distributed infection risks were predicted with and without mitigation measures, upon which critical parameters of portable air cleaners can be optimized. The method can be employed for estimating local infection risks of airborne respiratory diseases using either measured or simulated pathogen concentration.","Zhai, Zhiqiang Li He",Indoor and Built Environment,201,29

The Golgi apparatus is generally viewed as the transitory station where palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs) modify PMPs, which are then transported to their ultimate destinations such as plasma membrane (PM); little substrate specificity among the many PATs has been determined. Here we describe inherent partitioning of Gαo – α-subunit of heterotrimeric Go-proteins – to PM and Golgi, independent from Golgi-to-PM transport. A minimal code within the Gαo N-terminus governs the compartmentalization and re-coding produces G-protein versions with shifted localization. We established the S-palmitoylation at the outer nuclear membrane assay (“SwissKASH”) to probe substrate specificity of PATs in intact cells. With this assay, we showed that PATs localizing to different membrane compartments display remarkable substrate selectivity, which is the basis for specific PMP compartmentalization. Our findings uncover a novel mechanism governing protein localization and establish the basis for innovative drug discovery.","Solis, Gonzalo P.; Kazemzadeh, Arghavan; Valnohova, Jana; Abrami, Laurence; Alvarez, Cecilia; van der Goot, F.

Prion-like spread is proposed to require the transit of tau assemblies to the interior of neurons in order to seed aggregation of native, cytosolic tau. This process is poorly understood and remains largely hypothetical. Here, we develop sensitive techniques to quantify the cytosolic entry of tau in real-time. We find that tau does not promote its own entry but, rather, is wholly dependent on cellular machinery. We find that entry to the widely used reporter cell line HEK293 requires clathrin whereas entry to neurons does not. Cholesterol depletion or knockdown of cholesterol transport protein Niemann-Pick type C1 in neurons renders cells highly vulnerable to cytosolic entry and seeded aggregation. Our findings establish entry as the rate-limiting step in seeded aggregation and demonstrate that dysregulated cholesterol, a feature of several neurodegenerative diseases, potentiates tau aggregation.

India especially with its rich heritage, culture and geographical landscapes has always had immense potential to become a leading tourist destination. Presently the major types of tourism prevalent in India are Medical Tourism, Rural/ Natural Tourism, Religious Tourism and Historical& Educational Tourism. In 2018-19, the tourism sector contributed around 5% to India’s GDP. However with the health shock of Covid-19, the tourism sector has taken a major hit since early 2020, with several people losing their jobs in the tourism and hospitality sector when different states imposed lockdowns and took various measures to curb the pandemic. As restrictions in each state eased during the first wave of the pandemic, different states in India adopted various policies to revive the tourism industry. But to understand the effectiveness of these policies in each state/ UT, one needs to investigate the baseline at which the Tourism industry was before the pandemic hit the country. This paper attempts to look at the differential performances of states and UTs of India in tourism by categorizing them into various types of tourism between 1947 until March 2020.This paper aims to act as a base for further analysing the impact of this pandemic on Tourism across states in India.","Jacob, Megha Agarwal Archita Gupta Gunjan Raju Kavya Maria Khurana Rabani",Atna Journal of Tourism Studies,201,1

In response to the joint economic and health crises caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is an opportunity for emerging market countries to develop and implement inclusive housing strategies that stimulate the economy and improve community health outcomes. However, so far housing does not feature prominently in the recovery plans of many emerging market countries. Design/methodology/approach This paper uses national account data and informal housing estimates for 11 emerging market economies to estimate the contribution of housing investments and housing services to the GDP of these countries. Findings This paper finds that the combined contribution of housing investments and housing services represents between 6.9% and 18.5% of GDP, averaging 13.1% in the countries with information about both. This puts the housing sector roughly on par with other key sectors such as manufacturing. In addition, if the informal housing sector is undercounted in the official national account figures used in this analysis by 50% or 100%, for example, then the true averages of housing investments and housing services' contribution to GDP would increase to 14.3% or 16.1% of GDP, respectively. Research limitations/implications Further efforts to improve data collection about housing investments and consumption, particularly imputed rent for owner occupiers and informal activity require national government to conduct regular household and housing surveys. Researcher can help make these surveys more robust and leverage new data sources such as scraped housing price and rent data to complement traditional surveys. Better data are needed in order to capture housing contribution to the economy. Practical implications The size of the housing sector and its impact in terms of employment and community resilience indicate the potential of inclusive housing investments to both serve short-term economic stimulus and increase long-term community resilience. Originality/value The role of housing in the economy is often limited to housing investment, despite the importance of housing services and well-documented methodologies to include them. This analysis highlights the importance of housing to the economy of emerging market countries (in addition to all the non-GDP related impact of housing on welfare) and indicate data limitation that need to be addressed to further strengthen the case for focusing on housing as part of economic recovery plans.","Acolin, A.; Hoek-Smit, M.; Green, R.

So-called rational drug design is suboptimal when it comes to finding effective and safe drug-based treatment for COVID-19. Another approach seems promising: to reprofile the pharmaceuticals registered in the Anatomical, Therapeutic, and Chemical Classifier (ATC). Material and methods. Chemoreactome screening, a method that simulates the results of inhibiting viral growth in a cell culture, models the effects of pharmaceuticals on the human virome, and estimates the adverse effects of medicines, was used to reprofile about 2700 pharmaceuticals from the ATC. The information technology behind chemoreactome analysis is based on the topological recognition theory advanced by the Institute of Pharmaceutical Informatics, Federal Research Center for Informatics and Control, Russian Academy of Sciences. Results. Sixty two pharmaceuticals and 20 micronutrients were found to have a pronounced antiviral effect with minimal side effects. Comparison against data of basic research and clinical trials showed 31 out of 62 pharmaceuticals to have been independently confirmed usable in COVID-19 treatment. These inhibit coronaviral proteins and/or function as adaptogenic molecules that improve the functioning of cells exposed to viral stress. Glucosamine sulfate was found to have the best safety profile and minimum effects on the healthy human virome out of all the tested anticoronaviral micronutrients. Conclusions. Reprofiling of pharmaceuticals registered in the ATC could significantly speed up the search for more effective and safer drug-based COVID-19 treatments. Several micronutrients show promise for long-term coronavirus prevention, especially in the elderly.","Torshin, I. Yu Gromova O. A.; Chuchalin, A. G.; Zhuravlev, Y. I.",Farmakoekonomika,201,28

The prevalence of sepsis is higher in male infants than in females, but the exact cause is unknown. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is an enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway, which leads to the production of NADPH. NADPH is required for the respiratory burst reaction in white blood cells (WBCs) to destroy microorganisms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of G6PD deficiency in neonates with sepsis. Materials and methods.This study was performed on 76 neonates with sepsis and 1214 normal neonates from February 2012 to November 2014 in the west of Iran. The G6PD deficiency status was determined by fluorescent spot test. WBCs number and neutrophils percentages were measured and compared in patients with and without G6PD deficiency. Results.The prevalence of the G6PD deficiency in neonates with sepsis was significantly higher compared to the control group (p=0.03). WBCs number and neutrophils percentages in G6PD deficient patients compared with patients without G6PD deficiency were decreased, but were not statistically significant (p=0.77 and p=0.86 respectively). Conclusions.G6PD deficiency is a risk factor of neonatal sepsis and also a justification for more male involvement in this disease. Therefore, newborn screening for this disorder is recommended.","Rostami-Far, Z; Ghadiri, K; Rostami-Far, M; Shaveisi-Zadeh, F; Amiri, A; Rahimian Zarif, B",J Med Life,201,19

Its genome is 7690 nucleotides in length and encodes three open reading frames (ORFs). The smallest, ORF3, is located at the extreme 3' end of the genome and can potentially encode a polypeptide of approximately 12 kDa. In this paper, we report the identification of an ORF3-encoded polypeptide in FCV-infected cells using an antiserum raised against a bacterially-expressed bacteriophage T7 gene 10-ORF3 fusion protein. Although a small mRNA of 0-5 kb, which could potentially encode ORF3, has been described, reports on the number and size of FCV subgenomic RNAs have varied considerably. To clarify the situation, RNAs from FCV-infected cells were labelled in vivo using [32P]orthophosphate, an approach which provided definitive data. Only two RNA species were detected, the genomic RNA and a subgenomic mRNA of 2.4 kb. The 5' end of the subgenomic mRNA was mapped to position 5227 on the genomic RNA using RNA sequencing and primer extension methods. RNA isolated from FCV-infected cells in which no subgenomic RNA smaller than 2.4 kb was detectable directed the synthesis in rabbit reticulocyte lysate of the ORF3-encoded polypeptide. Furthermore, a synthetic RNA copy of the 2-4 kb subgenomic mRNA of FCV, containing both ORF2 and ORF3 polypeptides in the in vitro translation system. These data strongly suggest that ORF3 is expressed from the 2-4 kb subgenomic RNA and that this RNA is functionally bicistronic. The possible mechanisms by which ORF3 is expressed are discussed.","Herbert, T P; Brierley, I; Brown, T D",The Journal of general virology,201,19

The purpose of this trial was to evaluate a novel device for ETT cleaning. We hypothesized that its routine use would reduce tube occlusion due to mucus accumulation, while decreasing airway bacterial colonization. METHODS Subjects were randomized to either the use of the device every 8 h, or the institutional standard of care (blind tracheal suction) only. ETTs were collected at extubation and analyzed with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) for quantification of mucus volume. Microbiological testing was performed on biofilm samples. Vital signs and ventilatory settings were collected at the bedside. In-hospital follow-up was conducted, and a final evaluation survey was completed by respiratory therapists. RESULTS Seventy-four subjects expected to remain intubated for longer than 48 h were enrolled (77 ETTs, 37 treatment vs 40 controls). Treated tubes showed reduced mucus accumulation (0.56 ± 0.12 vs 0.71 ± 0.28 mL; P = .004) and reduced occlusion (6.3 ± 1.7 vs 8.9 ± 7.6%; P = .039). The HRCT slice showing the narrowest lumen within each ETT exhibited less occlusion in cleaned tubes (10.6 ± 8.0 vs 17.7 ± 13.4%, 95% CI: 2-12.1; P = .007). Data on microbial colonization showed a trend in the treatment group toward a reduced ETT-based biomass of bacteria known to cause ventilator-associated pneumonia. No adverse events were reported. The staff was satisfied by the overall safety and feasibility of the device. CONCLUSION The endOclear is a safe and effective device. It prevents luminal occlusion, thereby better preserving ETT nominal function.","Pinciroli, Riccardo; Mietto, Cristina; Piriyapatsom, Annop; Chenelle, Christopher T; Thomas, John G; Pirrone, Massimiliano; Bry, Lynn; Wojtkiewicz, Gregory R; Nahrendorf, Matthias P; Kacmarek, Robert M; Berra, Lorenzo",Respiratory care,201,20

The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance characteristics of the new sampling system in both laboratory and field conditions. METHODS The measurements were conducted using the N95 filtering facepiece respirators and the newly developed personal sampling system put on a manikin (laboratory study) or donned by a human subject (laboratory and field studies). Two inhalation flow rates (0 and 40 l min(-1)) in conjunction with the sampling flow rate (10 l min(-1)) were tested in the manikin-based experiments to investigate the effects of the leak location (nose, cheek and chin) and the depth of the sampling probe (0, 5, 10 and 15 mm) within the respirator. The effect of human activity on the protection factor was evaluated using a variety of head movements and breathing patterns when a human subject wore the respirator in a room-size laboratory test chamber. The field study was conducted during corn harvesting with a respirator worn by a human subject on a combine. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the protection factors for different leak locations, or for sampling probe depths, when the inhalation rate was 0 l min(-1). For the inhalation rate of 40 l min(-1), the protection factors for nose leaks were higher than those for chin and cheek leaks. Furthermore, the protection factor was the lowest and showed the least variation when the sampling probe depth was equal to 0 mm (imbedded on the respirator surface). Human subject testing showed that the grimace maneuver decreased the protection factor and changed the original respirator fit. The protection factor during breath holding was lower than that found during inhalation and exhalation. Field results showed greater variation than laboratory results. CONCLUSIONS The newly designed personal sampling system efficiently detected the changes in protection factors in real time. The sampling flow was least affected by the inhalation flow when the sampling probe was imbedded on the respirator surface. Leak location, breathing patterns and exercises did affect the measurement of the protection factors obtained using an N95 filtering facepiece respirator. This can be attributed to the differences in the in-mask airflow dynamics contributed by the leak, filter material, sampling probe and inhalation. In future studies, it would be beneficial if the laboratory data could be integrated with the field database.","Lee, Shu-An; Grinshpun, Sergey A; Adhikari, Atin; Li, Weixin; McKay, Roy; Maynard, Andrew; Reponen, Tiina",The Annals of occupational hygiene,201,19

A diagnosis of sarcoidosis was established due to the presence of dyspnea, fever, and malaise along with bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and histological evidence of non-caseating granuloma. In addition, he fulfilled the American Rheumatism Association (ACR) criteria for SLE due to a history of photosensitivity, polyarthritis, lymphocytopenia, and positivity of ANA and anti-dsDNA antibodies. He was successfully treated with a combination of oral glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine, and methotrexate. In a further step, we conducted an extensive literature review to further investigate into the association of sarcoidosis and SLE. We identified 25 additional published cases. The concurrence of these two conditions may be more common than previously reported, mainly affecting young female adults in the fourth decade of life. The most common manifestation of sarcoidosis was mild pulmonary symptoms whereas SLE presentation was highly variable. Most patients were positive for anti-dsDNA antibodies. Different therapeutic strategies included oral glucocorticoids, hydroxychloroquine, conventional immunosuppressive drugs and, cyclophosphamide in severe cases. Our study reinforces the need of considering the potential concurrence of sarcoidosis and SLE.

Hence, if the coronavirus infection also results in VOCs excretion, physicians could ""smell"" the virus by using electronic noses. We conducted a literature review on olfaction changes and the COVID-19. Our results suggest that these changes could be used an indication for early testing, even as an isolated symptom.

Methods: Data of 173 inpatients at Huoshenshan Hospital from February 10 to March 17, 2020, were analyzed retrospectively. Clinical characteristics, partial test results, and the influence of glucocorticoid therapy on the clinical outcomes of nucleic acid negative conversion and changes in lung CT images were compared. The patients were divided at admission into 4 groups according to the course of disease and glucocorticoid treatment. Differences among the groups were analyzed statistically. Results: The median age of 173 patients was 62 years, and 91.3% were over 40 years old. Underlying diseases occurred in 50.3% of patients, 32.6% had family gatherings, and 24.3% had exposure while shopping or at a hospital. Median times of nucleic acid negative conversion in group A+B (course of disease < 3 weeks) and group C+D (course of disease ≥ 3 weeks) were 23 days and 37 days, respectively (P < 0.05).

A monoclonal antibody recognizing p73, the major structural protein of ASF virus, was generated to analyze the binding of p73 to membranes during the assembly of the virus. Approximately 50% of the intracellular pool of p73 associated with membranes as a peripheral membrane protein. Binding was rapid and complete within 15 min of synthesis. Subcellular membrane fractionation showed that newly synthesized p73 molecules cosedimented with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and remained associated with the ER during a 2-h chase. A similar distribution on gradients was recorded for p17, a structural membrane protein of ASF virus. The results suggested that the ER was involved in the assembly of ASF virus. A protease protection assay demonstrated a time-dependent envelopment of the membrane bound, but not cytosolic, pool of p73. Envelopment of p73 took place 1 h after binding to membranes and was completed 1 h before the first detection of p73 in virions secreted from cells. Envelopment was unaffected by brefeldin A and monensin, drugs that block membrane transport between the ER and Golgi. Taken together the results provide evidence for the binding of ASF virus structural proteins to a specific membrane compartment and implicate a role for the ER in the assembly and envelopment of ASF virus.","Cobbold, C; Whittle, J T; Wileman, T",Journal of virology,201,10

Lateral apical suspension to the abdominal wall with mesh is a feasible alternative of ASC where robotic assistance may offer specific advantages. We here describe the surgical technique and the short-term outcomes of robotic-assisted lateral apical suspension (R-ALS) with the use of a titan-covered T-shaped mesh. METHODS Forty consecutive patients with stage III or IV symptomatic anterior and apical pelvic organ prolapse underwent R-ALS between September 2014 and September 2015. RESULTS R-ALS was completed without complications in all cases with a mean operative time of 117 ± 26 min. From a technical standpoint, robotic assistance allowed for an extremely reproducible technique, with a swift learning curve and consistent length of the surgical steps. The procedure was extremely well tolerated and resulted in complete resolution of POP-associated symptoms and in improvements of POP- and incontinence-related quality-of-life scores (PQOL and IIQ7) at 1 month from surgery. CONCLUSIONS R-ALS is feasible, safe, well-tolerated and effective at a short-term follow-up. R-ALS may represent an effective and simple alternative to abdominal sacral hystero-cervicopexy for the treatment of high-grade apical and anterior POP, avoiding the challenges of sacral mesh fixation. Robotic assistance helps achieving optimally tailored anatomic reconstruction, allowing seamless deep pelvic dissection and suturing.","Simoncini, Tommaso; Russo, Eleonora; Mannella, Paolo; Giannini, Andrea",Surgical endoscopy,201,21

Certain population groups are more likely to have micronutrient deficiencies, while certain disease pathologies and treatment practices also exacerbate risk, meaning these groups tend to suffer increased morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases. Optimisation of overall nutritional status, including micronutrients, can be effective in reducing incidence of infectious disease. Micronutrient deficiencies are rarely recognised but are prevalent in the UK, as well as much more widely, particularly in high-risk groups susceptible to COVID-19. Practitioners should be aware of this fact and should make it a consideration for the screening process in COVID-19, or when screening may be difficult or impractical, to ensure blanket treatment as per the best practice guidelines. Correction of established micronutrient deficiencies, or in some cases assumed suboptimal status, has the potential to help support immune function and mitigate risk of infection. The effects of and immune response to COVID-19 share common characteristics with more well-characterised severe acute respiratory infections. Correction of micronutrient deficiencies has proven effective in several infectious diseases and has been shown to promote favourable clinical outcomes. Micronutrients appear to play key roles in mediating the inflammatory response and such effects may be enhanced through correction of deficiencies. Many of those at highest risk during the COVID-19 pandemic are also populations at highest risk of micronutrient deficiencies and poorer overall nutrition. Correction of micronutrient deficiencies in established COVID-19 infection may contribute to supporting immune response to infection in those at highest risk. There is a need for further research to establish optimal public health practice and clinical intervention regimens.","McAuliffe, Shane; Ray, Sumantra; Fallon, Emily; Bradfield, James; Eden, Timothy; Kohlmeier, Martin",BMJ Nutr Prev Health,201,22

Understanding of these abnormalities is continually evolving, but these conditions may pose a risk to patients with COVID-19 beyond the risk typically seen in critically ill patients. SUMMARY: There are currently no widely accepted evidence-based guidelines regarding specifics related to treatment and prevention of COVID-19-related coagulopathies. Areas of management requiring clinical equipoise include agent selection and dosing, continuation vs interruption of home oral anticoagulant therapy during hospital admission, and postdischarge VTE prophylaxis. Clinicians may wish to consider use of a stratified, 3-tiered approach of low-intensity anticoagulation, intermediate-intensity anticoagulation, and therapeutic-dose anticoagulation. Patients can be categorized by tier depending on their risk factors for VTE, acuity of illness, and laboratory values such as D-dimer level. CONCLUSION: Practical guidance on anticoagulation considerations and dosing suggestions are provided to assist clinicians faced with challenging anticoagulation-related situations in caring for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 until formal evidence-based guidelines become available.","Smith, Kelly; Krajewski, Kristin C; Krajewski, Michael P",Am J Health Syst Pharm,201,12

Imaging modalities enable evaluation of the character and extent of pulmonary lesions and monitoring of the disease course. The aim of this study was to verify the prognostic value of chest CT in COVID-19 patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS We conducted a retrospective review of clinical data and CT scans of 156 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase-chain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay hospitalized in the Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior in Warsaw and in the Medical Centre in Lancut, Poland. The total severity score (TSS) was used to quantify the extent of lung opacification in CT scans. RESULTS The dominant pattern in discharged patients was ground-glass opacities, whereas in the non-survivors, the dominant pulmonary changes were consolidations. The non-survivors were more likely to have pleural effusion, pleural thickening, lymphadenopathy, air bronchogram, and bronchiolectasis. There were no statistically significant differences among the 3 analyzed groups (non-survivors, discharged patients, and patients who underwent prolonged hospitalization) in the presence of fibrotic lesions, segmental or subsegmental pulmonary vessel enlargement, subpleural lines, air bubble sign, and halo sign. CONCLUSIONS Lung CT is a diagnostic tool with prognostic utility in COVID-19 patients. The correlation of the available clinical data with semi-quantitative radiological features enables evaluation of disease severity.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional pilot study of the prevalence of burnout and long covid among senior physicians. A survey was sent by email to members of the Irish Hospital Consultant's Association. The survey included measures of mental and physical health and the 2-item Maslach Burnout Scale (MBS-2). The study explored the experience of delivering health care in the context of a pandemic and experience of the long covid syndrome. RESULTS: A total of 114 responses were received. Three-quarters 77% (N = 88) screened positive for burnout on the MBS, with mean score of 5.6 (SD3.3), nearly double the cut-off for burnout. Nearly two-thirds (64%, n = 72) reported that Covid-19 has had an adverse effect on their mental health. One-quarter reported that they or colleagues had experience of 'long-covid' secondary to the virus.

Populations that are vulnerable to this outbreak and its physical and mental health effects include community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia. Telehealth is a potential tool to deliver health care and decrease exposure risk. OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to explore the impact of confinement on the health and well-being of community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, to provide television-based and telephone-based health and social support, and to study the effects of a television-based assistive integrated technology, TV-AssistDem (TeleVision-based ASSistive Integrated Service to supporT European adults living with mild DEMentia or mild cognitive impairment). METHODS: A telephone-based survey was administered in Spain to 93 participants in the TV-AssistDem clinical trial from March 25 to April 6, 2020. RESULTS: Of the respondents, 60/93 (65%) were women. The mean age was 73.34 (SD 6.07), and 69/93 (74%) lived accompanied. Lockdown measures forced 17/93 respondents (18%) to change their living arrangements. Health status was found to be optimal in 89/93 respondents (96%), with no COVID-19 symptoms.

This study examined the experience and attitudes of mental health care providers toward telehealth. METHODS: At 18 centers across the United States, 819 mental health care providers completed an electronic survey about telepsychiatry use and satisfaction. RESULTS: Overall, 73% of providers using videoconferencing and 66% using the telephone rated their experience as excellent or good. Flexible scheduling or rescheduling (77%) and timely start (69%) were frequently reported advantages for both modalities. Challenges were related to patients' inability to use conferencing devices (52%), lack of sense of closeness or connection (46%), and technical problems (39%). After the pandemic resolves, 64% of respondents would want to continue using telepsychiatry in at least 25% of their caseload.

The objective of this study was to evaluate clinical and laboratory characteristics and outcomes of 24 COVID-19 pregnant patients and their newborns referred to the Al-Zahra tertiary maternity hospital in Tabriz, Iran. METHODS: Clinical records of 24 COVID-19 confirmed pregnant patients were retrospectively reviewed from10 March 2020 to 15 April 2020. Vertical transition was assessed through neonatal pharyngeal swab samples. The study has been approved by the Tabriz University Medical Ethics Committee (IR.TBZMED.REC.1399.497). RESULTS: There were 24 hospitalized cases with clinical symptoms and confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. The mean age of cases was 26.5 years; most were nulliparous (54.2%), in their third trimester (62.5%) and were in the type A blood group. Clinical symptoms in order of prevalence were cough, fever, dyspnea, myalgia, anosmia, and diarrhea. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) in 70.8% cases was in the normal range (greater than 93%). The risk of premature labor or abortion in cases showed no increase. 12 cases were in ongoing normal status; on follow up, 11 cases had delivered their babies at term and one had ended in IUFD because of pregnancy-induced hypertension. All delivered babies were healthy. Caesarean section in all cases was performed under obstetric indications or maternal demand, and no relation was found between COVID-19 and Caesarean delivery. Neonatal outcomes according to gestational age in 8 cases out of 11 (72.72%) were desirable; neonatal morbidity and mortality resulted from pregnancy complications. Blood pH in 6 neonates was assessed due to immaturity and NICU admission, all of which were in normal ranges except one case related to HELLP syndrome. There was no evidence of vertical transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that clinical symptoms in pregnancy were similar to non-pregnant women, no rise in risk of premature labor or abortion was seen, and vertical transmission was not observed in none of cases. Lymphopenia was the leading laboratory change. Given asymptomatic cases despite severe forms of infection in pregnancies, we propose screening in all suspected cases. All placentas and newborns should be tested in the field for vertical transmission.","Vaezi, Maryam; Mirghafourvand, Mojgan; Hemmatzadeh, Shahla",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,201,5

There is uncertainty surrounding which patients benefit from corticosteroids in combination with tocilizumab and the dosage and timing of these agents. The balance of controlling inflammation without increasing the risk of secondary infection is difficult. At present, dexamethasone 6 mg is the standard of care in COVID-19 hypoxia; whether this is the ideal choice of steroid or dosage remains to be proven. OBJECTIVES: The primary objective was to assess the impact on mortality of tocilizumab only, corticosteroids only, and combination therapy in patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure. METHODS: A multihospital, retrospective study of adult patients with severe respiratory failure from COVID-19 who received supportive therapy, corticosteroids, tocilizumab, or combination therapy were assessed for 28-day mortality, biomarker improvement, and relative risk of infection. Propensity-matched analysis was performed between corticosteroid alone and combination therapies to further assess mortality benefit. RESULTS: The steroid-only, tocilizumab-only, and combination groups showed hazard reduction in mortality at 28 days when compared with supportive therapy. In a propensity-matched analysis, the combination group (daily equivalent dexamethasone 10 mg and tocilizumab 400 mg) had an improved 28-day mortality compared with the steroid-only group (daily equivalent dexamethasone 10 mg; hazard ratio (95% CI) = 0.56 (0.38-0.84), P = 0.005] without increasing the risk of infection. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Combination of tocilizumab and corticosteroids was associated with improved 28-day survival when compared with corticosteroids alone. Modification of steroid dosing strategy as well as steroid type may further optimize therapeutic effect of the COVID-19 treatment.","Brosnahan, Shari B; Chen, Xian Jie Cindy; Chung, Juri; Altshuler, Diana; Islam, Shahidul; Thomas, Sarun V; Winner, Megan D; Greco, Allison A; Divers, Jasmin; Spiegler, Peter; Sterman, Daniel H; Parnia, Sam",Ann Pharmacother,201,28

It can therefore be considered the first ""globalized"" disease, thanks also to the crowds that favoured the rebalancing of infectious agents between Europe and the Middle East. In this paper we analyse all the official documents of the time, highlighting the most effective prevention measures implemented in the city of Ferrara during the Italian plague. Historical mortality data for the 1630 Italian plague in northern Italy are first analysed. In contrast to the high rates recorded throughout the area from Milan to Florence, the mortality rate in Ferrara remained normal over the period. From the city's documents it emerged that the authorities, from the 16th century onwards, had already understood that the spread of the contagion could also occur through domestic animals, although rats are never mentioned. The strength of Ferrara's response to the ""plague emergency"" stems from an efficient and emergency-ready health control system, financed and supported by the ""permanent surveillance team of the city and the Pontifical Legation of Ferrara - Azienda Sanitaria Pubblica"" even in times of great economic difficulty for the State. Among the various measures that the city of Ferrara adopted to deal with the plague the following should be mentioned: guards at the city gates, lazarettos, safety of doctors, self-isolation and treatment of every suspicious case as if it were a real case of plague, measures to support the poorer classes of the population, veterinary and hygiene standards for the city and for housing, management of Catholic religious functions and the precepts of the Legation of Ferrara, which was under papal control, closure of churches to avoid mass gatherings, and limitations of all kinds of social and economic relations within and outside the population. The broad regimen, laid down in the 16th century, contains extremely modern health rules which are very much in line with those recommended by the WHO and the health authorities of each individual state in the current COVID-19 pandemic, even starting with hand-washing. The fight against epidemics of the past, especially the history of the plague in the 17th century, anticipates very important and valid concepts, and represents a wake-up call for the recent epidemics of emerging pathogens.","Vicentini, Chiara Beatrice; Contini, Carlo",Infez Med,201,12

In this study, we aimed to explore the HRIs' types and patient characteristics among a sample taken from various representative in-field points in the Hajj season. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 2018 at 80 data collection points distributed in the field. Data related to demographics, features and risk factors were collected and analyzed from all encountered cases with suspected HRIs. Moreover, we developed a diagnostic tree for HRIs by using the XGBoost model. Out of the 1200 persons encountered during the study period, 231 fulfilled the criteria of HRIs spectrum and were included in this study. Around 6% had HS and 20% had HE. All HS cases (100%) were from outside of Saudi Arabia as compared with 72.5% diagnosed with HE (27.5% were from Saudi Arabia). In addition, 16% were considered as heat-induced muscle spasms, and 7% had limb heat edema. Additionally, most of HRIs cases were reported between 11 am and 1 pm. The HRIs diagnostic tree model gave a diagnostic accuracy of 93.6%. This study highlights the magnitude of HRIs among pilgrims in Hajj and provides a diagnostic tree that can aid in the risk stratification and diagnosis of these patients. We advise the implementation of more educational campaigns to pilgrims regarding preventable measures especially for the vulnerable groups (e.g. from outside Saudi Arabia, those with comorbidities and light-skinned people).","Alkassas, Wesam; Rajab, Ahmad Mamoun; Alrashood, Sara T; Khan, Muhammad Ayub; Dibas, Mahmoud; Zaman, Mohsin",Environ Sci Pollut Res Int,201,26

We then comparatively meta-analyze the data and model individual infectiousness by shedding viable virus via respiratory droplets and aerosols. Results: The analyses indicate heterogeneity in rVL as an intrinsic virological factor facilitating greater overdispersion for SARS-CoV-2 in the COVID-19 pandemic than A(H1N1)pdm09 in the 2009 influenza pandemic. For COVID-19, case heterogeneity remains broad throughout the infectious period, including for pediatric and asymptomatic infections. Hence, many COVID-19 cases inherently present minimal transmission risk, whereas highly infectious individuals shed tens to thousands of SARS-CoV-2 virions/min via droplets and aerosols while breathing, talking and singing.

It is urgent to understand how vaccines and antibodies in the development would be impacted by mutations. In this work, we first study the mechanism, frequency, and ratio of mutations on the spike (S) protein, which is the common target of most COVID-19 vaccines and antibody therapies. Additionally, we build a library of antibody structures and analyze their 2D and 3D characteristics. Moreover, we predict the mutation-induced binding free energy (BFE) changes for the complexes of S protein and antibodies or ACE2. By integrating genetics, biophysics, deep learning, and algebraic topology, we deduce that some of the mutations such as M153I, S254F, and S255F may weaken the binding of S protein and antibodies, and potentially disrupt the efficacy and reliability of antibody therapies and vaccines in the development. We provide a strategy to prioritize the selection of mutations for designing vaccines or antibody cocktails.","Chen, Jiahui; Gao, Kaifu; Wang, Rui; Wei, Guowei",,201,10

Recent work on the spread of interacting contagions on networks has highlighted that these interacting contagions can have counter-intuitive interplay with network structure. Here we generalize one of these frameworks to tackle three important features of the spread of awareness and disease: one, we model the dynamics on highly clustered, cliquish, networks to mimic the role of workplaces and households; two, the awareness contagion affects the spread of the biological contagion by reducing its transmission rate where an aware or vaccinated individual is less likely to be infected; and three, the biological contagion also affects the spread of the awareness contagion but by increasing its transmission rate where an infected individual is more receptive and more likely to share information related to the disease. Under these conditions, we find that increasing network clustering, which is known to hinder disease spread, can actually allow them to sustain larger epidemics of the disease in models with awareness. This counter-intuitive result goes against the conventional wisdom suggesting that random networks are justifiable as they provide worst-case scenario forecasts. To further investigate this result, we provide a closed-form criterion based on a two-step branching process (i.e., the numbers of expected tertiary infections) to identify different regions in parameter space where the net effect of clustering and co-infection varies. Altogether, our results highlight once again the need to go beyond random networks in disease modeling and illustrate the type of analysis that is possible even in complex models of interacting contagions.","H'ebert-Dufresne, Laurent; Mistry, Dina; Althouse, Benjamin M.",,201,22

The goal of this study was to report clinical data as well as incidence of vertical transmission in pregnant patients with COVID-19. This retrospective chart review was performed on pregnant women admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University in China with confirmed COVID-19 between January 20 through January 31, 2020. Clinical, laboratory, and radiologic records were reviewed by two investigators. Additionally, analyses from amniotic fluid, cord blood samples, and neonatal throat samples from the time of delivery were included. Vertical transmission was defined as positive testing for COVID-19 in these samples. Descriptive statistics were used. There were nine patients included in the analysis. All were in the third trimester on admission, the earliest presenting at 36 weeks, 2 days and all had a known source of exposure to COVID-19. None of the patients had baseline comorbidities, but one patient had gestational hypertension and another developed pre-eclampsia. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 were fever on admission (78%), postpartum fever (67%), cough (44%), myalgia (33%), and sore throat (22%). Most had low or normal leukocyte count (78%) and 5 (56%) had lymphopenia. C-reactive protein was greater than 10mg/L in 75% of patients. One was found to be co-infected with influenza, and all were diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia and required oxygen therapy and antibiotics. Many (67%) also received antivirals. Regarding delivery, all nine were live births delivered via cesarean section with 1-min Apgar scores of 8-9 and 5-min Apgar scores of 9-10. Four of the 9 were delivered prematurely at 36 weeks (44%) for a variety of reasons including premature rupture of membranes, pre-eclampsia, or pneumonia. None of the fluid samples at birth were positive for COVID-19. Additionally, all of the mothers and babies were discharged from the hospital. Limitations discussed include the retrospective nature of data abstraction and small sample size. Additionally all patients enrolled were in the third trimester. The authors concluded that pregnant patients with COVID-19 present with similar symptoms as nonpregnant patients. Also, based on this limited sample, the mothers had a low risk of complications and all of the infants tested negative for COVID-19 after birth, suggesting that vertical transmission is unlikely. Comment: There are still many uncertainties about the disease course of COVID-19 in pregnant patients. This review is reassuring, however this is a very small sample size so caution should be used in applying these results to our day to day patients, especially those at earlier gestational ages. More studies should be conducted on pregnant patients with COVID-19 in all trimesters to have a more accurate picture of how this virus affects pregnancy-related outcomes.","Eastin, Carly; Eastin, Travis",J.

Such changes can have a significant impact on mental health. Mobile sensing apps can passively record the daily life routines of people, thus making them aware of maladaptive behavioral adjustments to the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the views of people on mobile sensing apps that passively record behaviors and their potential to increase awareness and helpfulness for self-managing mental health during the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an anonymous web-based survey including people with and those without mental disorders, asking them to rate the helpfulness of mobile sensing apps for the self-management of mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was conducted in May 2020. RESULTS: The majority of participants, particularly those with a mental disorder (n=106/148, 72%), perceived mobile sensing apps as very or extremely helpful for managing their mental health by becoming aware of maladaptive behaviors. The perceived helpfulness of mobile sensing apps was also higher among people who experienced a stronger health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic (ß=.24; 95% CI 0.16-0.33; P<.001), had a better understanding of technology (ß=.17; 95% CI 0.08-0.25; P<.001), and had a higher education (ß=.1; 95% CI 0.02-0.19; P=.02).

Approximately 2% of cases in the United States are children, and in most cases the child is either asymptomatic or has mild symptoms. However, some pediatric cases can present with Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome (MIS-C). Understanding the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and management of MIS-C related to SARS-CoV-2 will help to streamline early diagnosis and treatment, particularly in pediatric patients with complex medical conditions. METHODS: This scoping review adopted methods from the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) manual for evidence synthesis and preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Primary studies of patients meeting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) criteria for MIS-C from December 31st, 2019 to Oct 5th, 2020 were identified using PubMed and Scopus. Articles were screened for eligibility, and data collection was conducted on those fulfilling inclusion criteria. RESULTS: Of 417 studies identified, 57 met inclusion criteria, accounting for 875 patients from 15 countries. Globally, 57% of children affected with MIS-C were males. The median age was 9 years old, ranging from 6 months to 21 years. Forty-five percent of the patients had underlying comorbidities including obesity and lung disease. Fever, conjunctivitis and GI symptoms were common. Most MIS-C patients had high biomarkers including troponin I, N-terminal prohormone of B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), D-dimer, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cells (WBCs), interleukin 6 (IL-6), procalcitonin, and ferritin. The treatment for most patients included IVIG and inotropic support. CONCLUSION: MIS-C can be a unique and potentially life-threatening manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 in children and often requires medical intervention.","Panigrahy, Neha; Policarpio, Joseph; Ramanathan, Rahul",J Pediatr Rehabil Med,201,1

In this study, we combine the crisis lifecycle and opinion leader concepts and use data mining and a set of predefined search terms (coronavirus and COVID-19) to investigate discourse on Twitter (101,271 tweets) and Sina Weibo (92,037 posts). Then, we use a topic modeling technique, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify the most common issues posted by users and temporal analysis to research the issue's trend. Social Network Analysis (SNA) allows us to discover the opinion leader on the two different platforms. Finally, we find that online discourse reflects the crisis lifecycle according to the stage of COVID-19 in China and the US. Regarding the status of the COVID-19 pandemic, users of Twitter tend to pay more attention to the economic situation while users of Weibo pay more attention to public health. The issues focused on in online discourse have a strong relationship with the development of the crisis in different countries.

I then use an integrable nonautonomous Lotka-Volterra model to study the interactions among these searches in three U.S. States (Mississippi, Nevada and Utah), the District of Columbia and in the U.S. as a whole. I find that the results are very similar in all areas analyzed, and for different specifications of the model. Prior to the pandemic outbreak, the interactions among health searches, unemployment searches and news consumption are very weak, i.e. an increase in searches for one of these topics does not affect the amount of searches for the others. However, from around the beginning of the pandemic these interactions intensify greatly, suggesting that the pandemic has created a tight link between the health and economic situation and the amount of news people consume. I observe that from March 2020 unemployment predates searches for news and for symptoms. Consequently, whenever searches for unemployment increase, all the other searches decrease. Conversely, when searches for any of the other topics considered increase, searches for unemployment also increase. This underscores the importance of mitigating the impact of COVID-19 on unemployment to avoid that this issue swallows all others in the mind of the people.","Sotis, Chiara",Qual Quant,201,18

Educational settings were categorised as early years settings (<5-year-olds), primary schools (5-11-year-olds; only years 1 and 6 allowed to return), secondary schools (11-18-year-olds; only years 10 and 12), or mixed-age settings (spanning a combination of the above). Further education colleges were excluded. Data were recorded in HPZone, an online national database for events that require public health management. RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 event rates and case rates were calculated for staff and students, and direction of transmission was inferred on the basis of symptom onset and testing dates. Events were classified as single cases, coprimary cases (at least two confirmed cases within 48 h, typically within the same household), and outbreaks (at least two epidemiologically linked cases, with sequential cases diagnosed within 14 days in the same educational setting). All events were followed up for 28 days after educational settings closed for the summer holidays. Negative binomial regression was used to correlate educational setting events with regional population, population density, and community incidence. FINDINGS: A median of 38â000 early years settings (IQR 35â500-41â500), 15â600 primary schools (13â450-17â300), and 4000 secondary schools (3700-4200) were open each day, with a median daily attendance of 928â000 students (630â000-1â230â000) overall. There were 113 single cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection, nine coprimary cases, and 55 outbreaks. The risk of an outbreak increased by 72% (95% CI 28-130) for every five cases per 100â000 population increase in community incidence (p<0·0001). Staff had higher incidence than students (27 cases [95% CI 23-32] per 100â000 per day among staff compared with 18 cases [14-24] in early years students, 6·0 cases [4·3-8·2] in primary schools students, and 6·8 cases [2·7-14] in secondary school students]), and most cases linked to outbreaks were in staff members (154 [73%] staff vs 56 [27%] children of 210 total cases). Probable direction of transmission was staff to staff in 26 outbreaks, staff to student in eight outbreaks, student to staff in 16 outbreaks, and student to student in five outbreaks. The median number of secondary cases in outbreaks was one (IQR 1-2) for student index cases and one (1-5) for staff index cases. INTERPRETATION: SARS-CoV-2 infections and outbreaks were uncommon in educational settings during the summer half-term in England. The strong association with regional COVID-19 incidence emphasises the importance of controlling community transmission to protect educational settings. Interventions should focus on reducing transmission in and among staff.

However, there is a lack of publicly available benchmark data, with most existing studies collecting their own data often with custom hardware and for varying sets of gestures. This limits the ability to compare various algorithms, as well as the possibility for research to be done without first needing to collect data oneself. We contribute to the advancement of this field by making accessible a benchmark dataset collected using a commercially available sensor setup from 20 persons covering 18 unique gestures, in the hope of allowing further comparison of results as well as easier entry into this field of research. We illustrate one use-case for such data, showing how we can improve gesture recognition accuracy by utilising transfer learning to incorporate data from multiple other persons. This also illustrates that the dataset can serve as a benchmark dataset to facilitate research on transfer learning algorithms.","Andersen, Thomas Buhl; Eliasen, R'ogvi; Jarlund, Mikkel; Yang, Bin",,201,14

Emerging evidence suggest the efficacy of cow’s milk fermented with the probiotic L. paracasei CBAL74 (FM-CBAL74) in preventing infectious diseases. We evaluated the protective action of FM-CBAL74 against SARS-CoV-2 infection in human enterocytes. Relevant aspects of SARS-CoV-2 infection were assessed: infectivity, host functional receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), and pro-inflammatory cytokines expression (IL-6, IL-15, IL-1β, VEGFβ, TNF-α, MCP-1, CXCL1). Pre-incubation with FM-CBA L74 reduced the number of infected cells. The expression of ACE2 and the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, VEGFβ, IL-15, IL-1β was downregulated by the pre-treatment with this fermented food. No effect on TMPRSS2, MCP-1, TNF-α and CXCL1 expression was observed. Modulating the crucial aspects of the infection, the fermented food FM-CBAL74 exerts a preventive action against SARS-CoV-2.

0 05), concomitantly with COVID-19 spread and institution of national countermeasures Changes in STEMI and NSTEMI were inversely associated with daily COVID-19 tests, cases, and/or death (P &lt; 0 05) In addition, STEMI and NSTEMI incidences were associated with daily NO2, PM10, and O3 concentrations, as well as temperature (P &lt;

0 001) Conclusion: Reductions in STEMI and NSTEMI in the COVID-19 pandemic may depend on different concomitant epidemiologic and pathophysiologic mechanisms In particular , recent changes in STEMI may depend on COVID-19 scare, leading to excess all-cause mortality, or effective reduced incidence, whereas reductions in NSTEMI may also be due to beneficial reductions in NO2 emissions in the lockdown phase 510 Mother and daughter: two sides of the same coin Most of the coronary events are due to atherosclerosis and its complications, though about the 20% of coronary heart disease in young adults is related to other patholo-gies such as coronary abnormalities, autoimmune diseases and connective tissue disorders The last two of these conditions are also associated to an increased risk of thromboembolic events We report a case of a 41-year-old woman, with two unexplained miscarriages and no cardiovascular risk factors, who had an ST-elevation myocardial infarction complicated by several episodes of ventricular fibrillations, and of her daughter, a 20-year-old-woman, previously healthy, who had, a few days later her mother's admission, a massive pulmonary embolism with syncope at presentation Laboratory tests demonstrated the presence of anticardiolipines antibodies of IgG isotype in both patients' serum With this case report we want to focus on the importance of considering acute myocardial infarction caused by an unexplained intracoronary thrombosis or pulmonary embolism such as first manifestations of pro-thrombotic states, especially in young patients Early diagnosis of these conditions, in fact, is crucial because it might entail therapeutic implications not only on the short-term (i e , rapid diagnosis and treatment of catastrophic antiphospholipid syndrome) but also on the long-term patient management Aims: Inflammation plays an important role in the pathophysiology of athero-thrombosis Many evidences have clearly indicated that endothelial cells stimulated with inflammatory mediators show an athero-thormbotic phenotype, since they express adhesion molecules and Tissue Factor (TF) on their surface L-6 seems to have a central role in modulating these phenomena Patients with elevated plasma levels of IL-6 have as higher risk to develop acute cardiovascular events (ACS) Epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that Vitamin D (VitD) deficiency is associated with the increased risk of ACS Here, we have investigated whether VitD might modulate TF expression in IL-6 treated endothelial cells Methods and results: HUVEC cultivated in medium enriched with VitD (10 nM) were stimulated with IL-6 (0,5ng/mL) TF gene (RT-PCR), protein (western blot), surface expression (FACS) and procoagulant activity (FXa generation assay) were measured NF-kB translocation was also investigated VitD significantly reduced TF gene as well protein expression and procoagulant activity in oxLDL-treated HUVEC These effects were associated with VitD modulation of NF-jB pathway Conclusion: This study, although in vitro, shows that VitD prevents the pro-throm-botic effects of IL-6 on endothelial cells by inhibiting TF expression Thus, we might speculate that this is one of the mechanims by which VitD exerts its protective cardi-ovascular effects","Griffo, Simone Gaspardone Achille Danesi Alessandro Ferranti Fabio Mariano Enrica Rotolo Francesco Musto Carmine Giosa Alessandro Di Marchegiani Giada Zoccai Giuseppe Biondi Versaci Francesco Santa Ospedale Goretti Maria Sant039;

Current recycling methods such as chemical recycling, mechanical recycling, and incineration require either pre-sorting and washing or releasing CO2. In this work, a carbon foam microwave plasma process is developed, utilizing plasma discharge to generate surface temperatures exceeding â¼3000 K in a N2 atmosphere, to convert unsorted white wastes into gases (H2, CO, C2H4, C3H6, CH4, etc.) and small amounts of inorganic minerals and solid carbon, which can be buried as artificial ""coal"". This process is self-perpetuating, as the new solid carbon asperities grafted onto the foam's surface actually increase the plasma discharge efficiency over time. This process has been characterized by in situ optical probes and infrared sensors and optimized to handle most of the forms of white waste without the need for pre-sorting or washing. Thermal measurement and modeling show that in a flowing reactor, the device can achieve locally extremely high temperatures, but the container wall will still be cold and can be made with cheap materials, and thus, a miniaturized waste incinerator is possible that also takes advantage of intermittent renewable electricity.","Xu, Guiyin; Jiang, Haibin; Stapelberg, Myles; Zhou, Jiawei; Liu, Mengyang; Li, Qing-Jie; Cao, Yunteng; Gao, Rui; Cai, Minggang; Qiao, Jinliang; Galanek, Mitchell S; Fan, Weiwei; Xue, Weijiang; Marelli, Benedetto; Zhu, Meifang; Li, Ju",Environ Sci Technol,201,1

On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. Since then, frontline healthcare professionals have been experiencing extremely stressful situations and damage to their physical and mental health. These adverse conditions cause stress and biochemical, hematological, and inflammatory changes, as well as oxidative damage, and could be potentially detrimental to the health of the individual. The study population consisted of frontline health professionals working in BHU in a city in southern Brazil. Among the 45 participants, two were infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus and were diagnosed using immunochromatographic tests such as salivary RT-LAMP and qRT-PCR. We also evaluated biochemical, hematological, inflammatory, and oxidative stress markers in the participants. The infected professionals (CoV-2-Prof) showed a significant increase in the levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), cholesterol, lactic dehydrogenase, lymphocytes, and monocytes. In this group, the levels of uric acid, triglycerides, leukocytes, neutrophils, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelets decreased. In the group of uninfected professionals (NoCoV-2-Prof), significant increase in HDL levels and the percentages of eosinophils and monocytes, was observed. Further, in this group, uric acid, LDH, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels, and the hematocrit count and mean corpuscular volume were significantly reduced. Both groups showed significant inflammatory activity with changes in the levels of C-reactive protein and mucoprotein. The NoCoV-2-Prof group showed significantly elevated plasma cortisol levels.

To limit the spread of COVID-19 and its negative consequences, many countries have applied strict social distancing rules. In this dramatic situation, people with eating disorders are at risk of their disorder becoming more severe or relapsing. The risk comes from multiple sources including fears of infection, the effects of social isolation as well as the limited availability of adequate psychological and psychiatric treatments. A potential practical solution to address some of these problems is to deliver enhanced cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT-E), an evidence-based treatment for all eating disorders, remotely. In this guidance we address three main topics. First, we suggest that CBT-E is suitable for remote delivery and we consider the challenges and advantages of delivering it in this way. Second, we discuss new problems that patients with eating disorders may face in this period. We also highlight potential opportunities for adapting some aspects of CBT-E to address them.

Immunosuppression could expose infected patients to even higher risks of disease complications due to dampened immune response. However, it has been speculated that overactive immune response could drive clinical deterioration and, based on this hypothesis, several immunosuppressants are currently being tested as potential treatment for COVID-19. METHODS: In this paper we report on a patient that has been treated with ocrelizumab (a B-cell depleting monoclonal antibody) for primary progressive multiple sclerosis who developed COVID-19. RESULTS: Despite complete B cell depletion, patient symptoms abated few days after hospitalization, and he was discharged to home-quarantine.

Understanding the factors associated with COVID-19 disease severity could support the early identification of patients with high risk for disease progression, inform prevention and control activities, and potentially reduce mortality. This study aims to describe the characteristics of patients with COVID-19 and factors associated with severe or critically ill presentation in Jiangsu province, China. METHODS: Multicentre retrospective cohort study of all individuals with confirmed Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections diagnosed at 24 COVID-19-designated hospitals in Jiangsu province between the 10th January and 15th March 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiological data were collected at hospital admission and data on disease severity were collected during follow-up. Patients were categorised as asymptomatic/mild/moderate, and severe/critically ill according to the worst level of COVID-19 recorded during hospitalisation. RESULTS: A total of 625 patients, 64 (10.2%) were severe/critically ill and 561 (89.8%) were asymptomatic/mild/moderate. All patients were discharged and no patients died. Patients with severe/critically ill COVID-19 were more likely to be older, to be single onset (i.e. not belong to a cluster of cases in a family/community, etc.), to have a medical history of hypertension and diabetes; had higher temperature, faster respiratory rates, lower peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2), and higher computer tomography (CT) image quadrant scores and pulmonary opacity percentage; had increased C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and D-dimer on admission; and had lower white blood cells, lymphocyte, and platelet counts and albumin on admission than asymptomatic/mild/moderate cases. Multivariable regression showed that odds of being a severe/critically ill case were associated with age (year) (OR 1.06, 95%CI 1.03-1.09), lymphocyte count (109/L) (OR 0.25, 95%CI 0.08-0.74), and pulmonary opacity in CT (per 5%) on admission (OR 1.31, 95%CI 1.15-1.51). CONCLUSIONS: Severe or critically ill patients with COVID-19 is about one-tenths of patients in Jiangsu. Age, lymphocyte count, and pulmonary opacity in CT on admission were associated with risk of severe or critically ill COVID-19.","Liu, Songqiao; Luo, Huanyuan; Wang, Yuancheng; Cuevas, Luis E; Wang, Duolao; Ju, Shenghong; Yang, Yi",BMC Infect Dis,201,16

No data have been reported on the impact of diabetes on treatment and outcome of STEMI patients, that was therefore the aim of the current subanalysis conducted in patients included in the International Study on Acute Coronary Syndromes-ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction (ISACS-STEMI) COVID-19. METHODS: The ISACS-STEMI COVID-19 is a retrospective registry performed in European centers with an annual volume of > 120 primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and assessed STEMI patients, treated with primary PCI during the same periods of the years 2019 versus 2020 (March and April). Main outcomes are the incidences of primary PCI, delayed treatment, and in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: A total of 6609 patients underwent primary PCI in 77 centers, located in 18 countries. Diabetes was observed in a total of 1356 patients (20.5%), with similar proportion between 2019 and 2020. During the pandemic, there was a significant reduction in primary PCI as compared to 2019, similar in both patients with (Incidence rate ratio (IRR) 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73-0.85, p < 0.0001) and without diabetes (IRR 0.81 (95% CI: 0.78-0.85, p < 0.0001) (p int = 0.40). We observed a significant heterogeneity among centers in the population with and without diabetes (p < 0.001, respectively). The heterogeneity among centers was not related to the incidence of death due to COVID-19 in both groups of patients. Interaction was observed for Hypertension (p = 0.024) only in absence of diabetes. Furthermore, the pandemic was independently associated with a significant increase in door-to-balloon and total ischemia times only among patients without diabetes, which may have contributed to the higher mortality, during the pandemic, observed in this group of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the treatment of patients with STEMI, with a similar reduction in primary PCI procedures in both patients with and without diabetes. Hypertension had a significant impact on PCI reduction only among patients without diabetes. We observed a significant increase in ischemia time and door-to-balloon time mainly in absence of diabetes, that contributed to explain the increased mortality observed in this group of patients during the pandemic.

The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), adapts and evolves rapidly in nature. With the availability of 16,092 SARS-CoV-2 full genomes in GISAID as of May 13th , we removed the poor-quality genomes and performed mutational profiling analysis for the remaining 11,183 viral genomes. Global analysis of all sequences identified all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the whole genome and critical SNPs with high mutation frequency that contributes to five-clade classification of global strains. A total of 119 SNPs was found with 74 non-synonymous mutations, 43 synonymous mutations, and 2 mutations in intergenic regions. Analysis of geographical pattern of mutational profiling for the whole genome reveals differences between each continent. A transition mutation from C to T represents the most mutation types across the genome, suggesting rapid evolution and adaptation of the virus in host. Amino acid (AA) deletions and insertions found across the genome results in changes in viral protein length and potential function alteration. Mutational profiling for each gene was analyzed and results show that nucleocapsid gene demonstrates the highest mutational frequency, followed by Nsp2, Nsp3, and Spike gene. We further focused on non-synonymous mutational distributions on four key viral proteins, spike with 75 mutations, RNA-dependent-RNA-polymerase with 41 mutations, 3C-like protease with 22 mutations, and Papain-like protease with 10 mutations. Results show that non-synonymous mutations on critical sites of these four proteins pose great challenge for development of anti-viral drugs and other countering measures. Overall, this study provides more understanding of genetic diversity / variability of SARS-CoV-2 and insights for development of anti-viral therapeutics.","Yuan, Fangfeng; Wang, Liping; Fang, Ying; Wang, Leyi",Transbound. emerg. dis.

A key to tackling this pandemic is to understand the receptor recognition mechanism of the virus, which regulates its infectivity, pathogenesis and host range. SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV recognize the same receptor-angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-in humans3,4. Here we determined the crystal structure of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (engineered to facilitate crystallization) in complex with ACE2. In comparison with the SARS-CoV RBD, an ACE2-binding ridge in SARS-CoV-2 RBD has a more compact conformation; moreover, several residue changes in the SARS-CoV-2 RBD stabilize two virus-binding hotspots at the RBD-ACE2 interface. These structural features of SARS-CoV-2 RBD increase its ACE2-binding affinity. Additionally, we show that RaTG13, a bat coronavirus that is closely related to SARS-CoV-2, also uses human ACE2 as its receptor. The differences among SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV and RaTG13 in ACE2 recognition shed light on the potential animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2.

This study analyzed patient and physician satisfaction with telehealth during the height of the pandemic within the division of sports medicine. Methods: All sports medicine patients who completed a telemedicine visit from March 30, 2020, through April 30, 2020, were sent a 14-question Likert scale (1-5/5) survey. Sports medicine physicians who used telemedicine were sent a separate 14-question Likert scale (1-5/5) survey at the end of the study period. Factors influencing patient satisfaction were determined using a multivariate linear regression model. Results: A total of 143 patients and 9 sports medicine attendings completed the surveys. Most patients were ""satisfied"" (4/5) or ""very satisfied"" (5/5) (88.8%). A multivariate linear regression determined that patients who believed they had a greater ability to adopt new technology and were more effective at communicating questions/concerns to their physicians had greater satisfaction (p = 0.009 and p = 0.015, respectively). Most physicians were either ""satisfied"" (4/5) or ""very satisfied"" (5/5) (75.0%). On average, physicians felt that physical examinations conducted through telemedicine were ""moderately effective"" (2.75/5.00 ± 1.3), that they were ""fairly confident"" (3.86/5.00 ± 0.83) in their diagnoses, and that most sports medicine attendings plan to use telemedicine in the future (87.5%). Conclusion: Telehealth emerged as a valuable tool for the delivery of health care to sports medicine patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Frequently encountered imaging findings include peripheral airspace consolidations; bilateral ground-glass opacities; and, less commonly, cavitation. Hilar lymphadenopathy is a rarely reported finding in the setting of COVID-19. CASE PRESENTATION: A 73-year-old Caucasian woman presented to our hospital with fever and fatigue. She had a maximum body temperature of 102.3 °F with lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia. She was diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection on the basis of a positive result from a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of a nasopharyngeal swab sample. Contrast-enhanced chest computed tomography revealed multifocal, subpleural ground-glass opacities with nodular consolidations bilaterally. Computed tomography also demonstrated atypical bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, a rarely reported imaging feature of COVID-19. Chest computed tomography 1 month before the presentation did not show focal consolidations or lymphadenopathy. This indicated that the findings were due to the patient's severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. She received 5 days of oral hydroxychloroquine and experienced resolution of her symptoms. CONCLUSION: Chest computed tomography has been used extensively to diagnose and characterize the distinguishing radiological findings associated with viral pneumonia. It has emerged as an integral part of the diagnosis of COVID-19 alongside reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assays. Clinicians must be aware of uncommon clinical and radiological findings in order to diagnose this entity. Hilar lymphadenopathy is commonly seen with fungal infections, mycobacterial infections, and sarcoidosis. An extensive literature review found that bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy has not been reported in the setting of COVID-19.

Causal inference provides a means of investigating causality in non-randomised experiments. Here we report 14-day improvement as well as 30-day and 90-day mortality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The first 86 patients (period 1) received optimal supportive care only; the second 86 patients (period 2) received methylprednisolone and (if necessary) tocilizumab, in addition to optimal supportive care. The main outcomes were 14-day clinical improvement and 30-day and 90-day survival. An 80% decline in C reactive protein (CRP) was recorded on or before day 13 (CRP >100 mg/L was an inclusion criterion). Non-linear mediation analysis was performed to decompose CRP-mediated effects of immunosuppression (defined as natural indirect effects) and non-CRP-mediated effects attributable to natural prognostic differences between periods (defined as natural direct effects). RESULTS: The natural direct (non-CRP-mediated) effects for period 2 versus period 1 showed an OR of 1.38 (38% better) for 14-day improvement and an OR of 1.16 (16% better) for 30-day and 90-day survival. The natural indirect (CRP-mediated) effects for period 2 showed an OR of 2.27 (127% better) for 14-day improvement, an OR of 1.60 (60% better) for 30-day survival and an OR of 1.49 (49% better) for 90-day survival. The number needed to treat was 5 for 14-day improvement, 9 for survival on day 30, and 10 for survival on day 90. CONCLUSION: Causal inference with non-linear mediation analysis further substantiates the claim that a brief but intensive treatment with immunosuppressants in patients with COVID-19 and systemic hyperinflammation adds to rapid recovery and saves lives.

Comment on Br J Anaesth 2020; 125: e301-5",19.987726,8.301301,2020,"BACKGROUND: The CHIC study (COVID-19 High-intensity Immunosuppression in Cytokine storm syndrome) is a quasi-experimental treatment study exploring immunosuppressive treatment versus supportive treatment only in patients with COVID-19 with life-threatening hyperinflammation. Causal inference provides a means of investigating causality in non-randomised experiments. Here we report 14-day improvement as well as 30-day and 90-day mortality. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The first 86 patients (period 1) received optimal supportive care only; the second 86 patients (period 2) received methylprednisolone and (if necessary) tocilizumab, in addition to optimal supportive care. The main outcomes were 14-day clinical improvement and 30-day and 90-day survival. An 80% decline in C reactive protein (CRP) was recorded on or before day 13 (CRP >100 mg/L was an inclusion criterion). Non-linear mediation analysis was performed to decompose CRP-mediated effects of immunosuppression (defined as natural indirect effects) and non-CRP-mediated effects attributable to natural prognostic differences between periods (defined as natural direct effects). RESULTS: The natural direct (non-CRP-mediated) effects for period 2 versus period 1 showed an OR of 1.38 (38% better) for 14-day improvement and an OR of 1.16 (16% better) for 30-day and 90-day survival. The natural indirect (CRP-mediated) effects for period 2 showed an OR of 2.27 (127% better) for 14-day improvement, an OR of 1.60 (60% better) for 30-day survival and an OR of 1.49 (49% better) for 90-day survival. The number needed to treat was 5 for 14-day improvement, 9 for survival on day 30, and 10 for survival on day 90. CONCLUSION: Causal inference with non-linear mediation analysis further substantiates the claim that a brief but intensive treatment with immunosuppressants in patients with COVID-19 and systemic hyperinflammation adds to rapid recovery and saves lives. Causal inference is an alternative to conventional trial analysis, when randomised controlled trials are considered unethical, unfeasible or impracticable.","Landewé, Robert B M; Ramiro, Sofia; Mostard, Rémy L M",,201,1

AIM: To explore health and social care professionals' experiences of providing end of life care during the COVID-19 pandemic to help inform current/future clinical practice and policy. DESIGN: A qualitative interview study. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Sixteen health and social care professionals working across a range of clinical settings in supporting dying patients during the first wave (March-June 2020) of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. RESULTS: Participants reported emotional and practical challenges to providing end of life care during the pandemic, including increases in patient numbers, reduced staffing levels and relying on virtual platforms for sensitive, emotive conversations with relatives. Participants were central to promoting connections between patients and their families at end of life and creating opportunities for a final contact before the death. However, the provision of support varied as a consequence of the pressures of the pandemic. Results are discussed under two themes: (1) challenges and facilitators to providing end of life care, and (2) support needs of relatives when a family member was dying during the COVID-19 pandemic. CONCLUSION: There is a need for flexible visiting arrangements at end of life during a pandemic. A systems-level approach is necessary to promote the wellbeing of health and social care professionals providing end of life care during and after a pandemic.","Hanna, Jeffrey R; Rapa, Elizabeth; Dalton, Louise J; Hughes, Rosemary; Quarmby, Louise M; McGlinchey, Tamsin; Donnellan, Warren J; Bennett, Kate M; Mayland, Catriona R; Mason, Stephen R",Palliat Med,201,16

We analyse the impact of the pandemic on telemedicine applied in Spanish headache consultations, review the literature, and issue recommendations for the implementation of telemedicine in consultations. METHOD: The study comprised 3 phases: 1) review of the MEDLINE database since 1958 (first reported experience with telemedicine); 2) Google Forms survey sent to all members of the Spanish Society of Neurology's Headache Study Group (GECSEN); and 3) online consensus of GECSEN experts to issue recommendations for the implementation of telemedicine in Spain. RESULTS: COVID-19 has increased waiting times for face-to-face consultations, increasing the use of all telemedicine modalities: landline telephone (from 75% before April 2020 to 97% after), mobile telephone (from 9% to 27%), e-mail (from 30% to 36%), and video consultation (from 3% to 21%). Neurologists are aware of the need to expand the availability of video consultations, which are clearly growing, and other e-health and m-health tools. CONCLUSIONS: The GECSEN recommends and encourages all neurologists who assist patients with headaches to implement telemedicine resources, with the optimal objective of offering video consultation to patients under 60-65 years of age and telephone calls to older patients, although each case must be considered on an individual basis. Prior approval and advice must be sought from legal and IT services and the centre's management. Most patients with stable headache and/or neuralgia are eligible for telemedicine follow-up, after a first consultation that must always be held in person.","Belvís, R; Santos-Lasaosa, S; Irimia, P; López Blanco, R; Torres-Ferrús, M; Morollón, N; López-Bravo, A; García-Azorín, D; Mínguez-Olaondo, A; Guerrero, Á; Porta, J; Giné-Ciprés, E; Sierra, Á; Latorre, G; González-Oria, C; Pascual, J; Ezpeleta, D",,201,24

Numerous recommendations and suggestions have been published to prevent the acquisition and spread of the SARS-CoV-2, especially to protect health workers and front-line caregivers. SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted by aerosol, rendering air defense with suitable ventilation and adequate mask use pivotal. Recently, locally applied antiseptic, antiviral, or structure competitive receptor blockers were suggested to attack the virus at its main point of invasion, the nasal mucosa and nasopharynx. We discuss the most plausible and safe ideas to reduce viral load at the point of entry, and subsequently the spread of SARS-CoV-2 to the lower respiratory tract, lungs, and other organs. In addition, we analyze the value and recommend clinical trials employing topical trichloroacetic acid (TCA), a substance well known from dermatologic and cosmetic procedures. It has been proven to successfully block the nasal entry for airborne allergens, preventing the development of allergic rhinitis and asthma, and to be curative for early stages of viral infections entering through the oral mucosa. For SARS-CoV-2, TCA in a single, short-time application is expected to remodel the nasal and nasopharyngeal epithelia, eliminating both the receptors and cells responsible for viral entry and subsequent viral spread to the lower respiratory tract. Moreover, this may have therapeutic benefits for those recently infected by reducing local viral replication. Such procedures are cheap, safe, and can be conducted in almost every setting, especially in regions with inadequate financial and logistic resources.","Abdelhadi, Shaden; Ruszczak, Zbigniew; Schwartz, Robert A",Dermatol Ther,201,21

Its causes have not been investigated yet. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that pulmonary capillary leakage affects the severity of respiratory failure, causing a shift of fluids and proteins through the epithelial-endothelial barrier. METHODS: One hundred seventy-four COVID-19 patients with respiratory symptoms, 92 admitted to the intermediate medicine ward (IMW) and 82 to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Luigi Sacco Hospital in Milan, were studied. RESULTS: Baseline characteristics at admission were considered. Proteins, interleukin 8 (IL-8) and interleukin 10 (IL-10) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were analysed in 26 ICU patients. In addition, ten autopsy ultrastructural lung studies were performed in patients with COVID-19 and compared with postmortem findings in a control group (bacterial pneumonia-ARDS and H1N1-ARDS). ICU patients had lower serum albumin than IMW patients [20 (18-23) vs 28 (24-33) g L-1 , P < 0.001]. Serum albumin was lower in more compromised groups (lower PaO2 -to-FiO2 ratio and worst chest X-ray findings) and was associated with 30 days of probability of survival. Protein concentration was correlated with IL-8 and IL-10 levels in BALF. Electron microscopy examinations of eight out of ten COVID-19 lung tissues showed loosening of junctional complexes, quantitatively more pronounced than in controls, and direct viral infection of type 2 pneumocytes and endothelial cells. CONCLUSION: Hypoalbuminaemia may serve as severity marker of epithelial-endothelial damage in patients with COVID-19. There are clues that pulmonary capillary leak syndrome plays a key role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 and might be a potential therapeutic target.","Wu, M A; Fossali, T; Pandolfi, L; Carsana, L; Ottolina, D; Frangipane, V; Rech, R; Tosoni, A; Lopez, G; Agarossi, A; Cogliati, C; Meloni, F; Marchini, B; Nebuloni, M; Catena, E; Colombo, R",J. intern. med,201,20

Its role in vivo is not known but it is postulated to be involved in reducing oxidative stress. The crystal structures of the wild type protein and several homologues have been determined in the absence and presence of ligands, including nicotinate as a mimic of the headpiece of the nicotinamide cofactors. There is little effect on the overall structure of the protein on binding ligands, but, from the B factors, there appears to be a decrease in mobility of 2 helices near the active site.

Much remains unknown about the mechanisms and targets of DPP4. Here we discuss new studies exploring DPP4-mediated cellular regulation, provide an updated list of potential targets of DPP4, and discuss clinical implications of each. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have sought enhanced efficacy of targeting DPP4's role in regulating hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells for improved clinical application. Further studies have identified DPP4 functions in different cellular compartments and have proposed ways to target this protein in malignancy. These findings, together with an expanded list of putative extracellular, cell surface, and intracellular DPP4 targets, provide insight into new DPP4-mediated cell regulation. SUMMARY: DPP4 posttranslationally modifies proteins and peptides with essential roles in hematopoietic cell regulation, stem cell transplantation, and malignancy. Targets include secreted signaling factors and may include membrane proteins and transcription factors critical for different hematopoietic functions. Knowing these targets and functions can provide insight into new regulatory roles for DPP4 that may be targeted to enhance transplantation, treat disease, and better understand different regulatory pathways of hematopoiesis.","Ropa, James; Broxmeyer, Hal E",Curr Opin Hematol,201,6

The rapid detection of viral nucleic acids is critical for the early identification of infected cases. We have developed two TaqMan real-time reverse transcription-PCR assays to detect SARS-CoV-2. The designed primers target the nucleocapsid (N) and open reading frame (ORF) 1b gene regions, where the probes discriminate SARS-CoV-2 from other human and animal CoVs. The sensitivities are one genomic copy per reaction for the N gene assay and ten copies for the ORF 1b gene assay. The overall linear detection ranges are 1-106 and 10-106 copies per reaction for the N gene assay and the ORF 1b gene assay, respectively. Surveillance of 23 suspected COVID-19 patients demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 could be detected from 100% (23/23) and 62.5% (16/23) of clinical specimens by the N gene assay and the ORF 1b gene assay, respectively. All of the samples not detected by the ORF 1b gene assay were throat swabs, indicating a lower viral load in the upper respiratory tract and the relatively lower sensitivity of the ORF 1b gene assay. The assays developed in the present study offer alternative diagnostic tests for COVID-19.","Liu, Yiwei; Wang, Yingying; Wang, Xinming; Xiao, Yan; Chen, Lan; Guo, Li; Li, Jianguo; Ren, Lili; Wang, Jianwei",,201,1

First, docking studies of three known electrophilic compounds led to results consistent with co-crystallized data validating the method for SARS-CoV-2 MPro covalent inhibition. Then, libraries of soft electrophiles (overall 41 757 compounds) were submitted to docking-based virtual screening resulting in the identification of 17 molecules having their electrophilic group close to the Cys145 residue.

Objective: To estimate the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths in the US as of November 15, 2020. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this cross-sectional study of respondents of all ages, data from 4 regional and 1 nationwide Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) seroprevalence surveys (April [n = 16â¯596], May, June, and July [n = 40â¯817], and August [n = 38â¯355]) were used to estimate infection underreporting multipliers and symptomatic underreporting multipliers. Community serosurvey data from randomly selected members of the general population were also used to validate the underreporting multipliers. Main Outcomes and Measures: SARS-CoV-2 infections, symptomatic infections, hospitalizations, and deaths. The median of underreporting multipliers derived from the 5 CDC seroprevalence surveys in the 10 states that participated in 2 or more surveys were applied to surveillance data of reported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases for 5 respective time periods to derive estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptomatic infections, which were summed to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptomatic infections in the US. Estimates of infections and symptomatic infections were combined with estimates of the hospitalization ratio and fatality ratio to derive estimates of SARS-CoV-2 hospitalizations and deaths. External validity of the surveys was evaluated with the April CDC survey by comparing results to 5 serosurveys (n = 22â¯118) that used random sampling of the general population. Internal validity of the multipliers from the 10 specific states was assessed in the August CDC survey by comparing multipliers from the 10 states to all states. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using the interquartile range of the multipliers to derive a high and low estimate of SARS-CoV-2 infections and symptomatic infections. The underreporting multipliers were then used to adjust the reported COVID-19 infections to estimate the full SARS-COV-2 disease burden. Results: Adjusting reported COVID-19 infections using underreporting multipliers derived from CDC seroprevalence studies in April (n = 16â¯596), May (n = 14â¯291), June (n = 14â¯159), July (n = 12â¯367), and August (n = 38â¯355), there were estimated medians of 46â¯910â¯006 (interquartile range [IQR], 38â¯192â¯705-60â¯814â¯748) SARS-CoV-2 infections, 28â¯122â¯752 (IQR, 23â¯014â¯957-36â¯438â¯592) symptomatic infections, 956â¯174 (IQR, 782â¯509-1â¯238â¯912) hospitalizations, and 304â¯915 (IQR, 248â¯253-395â¯296) deaths in the US through November 15, 2020. An estimated 14.3% (IQR, 11.6%-18.5%) of the US population were infected by SARS-CoV-2 as of mid-November 2020. Conclusions and Relevance: The SARS-CoV-2 disease burden may be much larger than reported COVID-19 cases owing to underreporting. Even after adjusting for underreporting, a substantial gap remains between the estimated proportion of the population infected and the proportion infected required to reach herd immunity. Additional seroprevalence surveys are needed to monitor the pandemic, including after the introduction of safe and efficacious vaccines.","Angulo, Frederick J; Finelli, Lyn; Swerdlow, David L",JAMA Netw Open,201,33

This helps to limit not only the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections but also the morbidity and mortality associated with it. Different strategies for screening of COVID-19 in containment zones and non-containment areas include testing of symptomatic patients and their contacts in fever clinics, hospital-based testing, testing on demand and population-based screening. The choice of tests like reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), rapid antigen testing (RAT) or antibody test depends upon these strategies and also the turnaround time. Currently, RT-PCR is considered the gold standard for COVID-19 detection. This commentary provides the insights and experiences on COVID-19 diagnosis by RT-PCR. The utility of this test is limited by several false positive, false negative and inconclusive results at early stages of infection, scarcity of reagents and lack of well-equipped labs including trained staff. Moreover, appropriate sample collection and transport, standard laboratory protocols, stringent quality control norms, good quality RNA extraction kits, PCR kits with suitable primers can help in improving accuracy of the test results.

Concurrently, the country has been experiencing a rise in number of COVID-19 cases due to overcrowding in evacuation centers and lack of social distancing. The simultaneous existence of natural disasters and pandemic has caused devastating and detrimental effects to the mental health of Filipinos. Nonetheless, the Philippine government, together with the World Health Organization and other humanitarian organizations, has been working hand-in-hand in implementing mental health approaches and providing psychological interventions to Filipinos who were greatly affected by the natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic.","Rocha, Ian Christopher Naungayan; Dos Santos Costa, Ana Carla; Islam, Zarmina; Jain, Shubhika; Goyal, Samarth; Mohanan, Parvathy; Essar, Mohammad Yasir; Ahmad, Shoaib",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,201,16

Many studies simply assume samples mixed in a group are independent. However, this assumption may not be reasonable for a contagious disease like COVID-19. Specifically, people within a family tend to infect each other and thus are likely to be positively correlated. By exploiting positive correlation, we make the following two main contributions. One is to provide a rigorous proof that further cost reduction can be achieved by using the Dorfman two-stage method when samples within a group are positively correlated. The other is to propose a hierarchical agglomerative algorithm for pooled testing with a social graph, where an edge in the social graph connects frequent social contacts between two persons. Such an algorithm leads to notable cost reduction (roughly 20%-35%) compared to random pooling when the Dorfman two-stage algorithm is applied.

We recently reported that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein S1 subunit (S1) induces pro-inflammatory responses by activating toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling in macrophages. ETAS(R)50, a standardized extract of Asparagus officinalis stem, is a unique functional food that elicits anti-photoaging effects by suppressing pro-inflammatory signaling in hydrogen peroxide- and ultraviolet B-exposed skin fibroblasts. To elucidate its potential in preventing excessive inflammation in COVID-19, we examined the effects of ETAS(R)50 on pro-inflammatory responses in S1-stimulated murine peritoneal exudate macrophages. Co-treatment of the cells with ETAS(R)50 significantly attenuated S1-induced secretion of interleukin (IL)-6 in a concentration-dependent manner without reducing cell viability. ETAS(R)50 also markedly suppressed the S1-induced transcription of IL-6 and IL-1{beta}. However, among the TLR4 signaling proteins, ETAS(R)50 did not affect the degradation of inhibitor {kappa}B, nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-{kappa}B p65 subunit, and phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase p54 subunit after S1 exposure. In contrast, ETAS(R)50 significantly suppressed S1-induced phosphorylation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Akt. Attenuation of S1-induced transcription of IL-6 and IL-1{beta} by the MAPK kinase inhibitor U0126 was greater than that by the Akt inhibitor perifosine, and the effects were potentiated by simultaneous treatment with both inhibitors. These results suggest that ETAS(R)50 attenuates S1-induced IL-6 and IL-1{beta} production by suppressing p44/42 MAPK and Akt signaling in macrophages. Therefore, ETAS(R)50 may be beneficial in regulating excessive inflammation in patients with COVID-19.","Shirato, Ken; Takanari, Jun; Kizaki, Takako",,201,21

Here we report high coverage whole genome sequencing of 76 unrelated individuals, from 27 indigenous groups across Mexico, with more than 97% average Native American ancestry. On average, each individual has 3.26 million Single Nucleotide Variants and short indels, that together comprise a catalog of 9,737,152 variants, 44,118 of which are novel. We report 497 common Single Nucleotide Variants (with allele frequency > 5%) mapped to drug responses and 316,577 in enhancer or promoter elements; interestingly we found some of these enhancer variants in PPARG, a nuclear receptor involved in highly prevalent health problems in Mexican population, such as obesity, diabetes, and insulin resistance. By detecting signals of positive selection we report 24 enriched key pathways under selection, most of them related to immune mechanisms. No missense variants in ACE2, the receptor responsible for the entry of the SARS CoV-2 virus, were found in any individual. Population genomics and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated stratification in a Northern-Central-Southern axis, with major substructure in the Central region. The Seri, a northern group with the most genetic divergence in our study, showed a distinctive genomic context with the most novel variants, and the most population specific genotypes. Genome-wide analysis showed that the average haplotype blocks are longer in Native Mexicans than in other world populations.

Worldwide, countries imposed stringent mass quarantine and lockdowns to curb the transmission of the pathogen. While the efficacy of such lockdown is debatable, several reports suggest that the reduced human activities provided an inadvertent benefit by briefly improving air and water quality. India observed a 68-days long, nation-wide, stringent lockdown between 24 March and 31 May 2020. Here, we delineate the impact of the lockdown on groundwater and river sourced drinking water sustainability in the arsenic polluted Ganges river basin of India, which is regarded as one of the largest and most polluted river basins in the world. Using groundwater arsenic measurements from drinking water wells and water quality data from river monitoring stations, we have studied ~700 km stretches of the middle and lower reaches of the As (arsenic)-polluted parts of the river for pre-lockdown (January-March 2020), syn-lockdown (April-May), and post-lockdown periods (June-July). We provide the extent of As pollution-free groundwater vis-à-vis river water and examine alleviation from lockdown as an opportunity for sustainable drinking water sources. The overall decrease of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentrations and increase of pH suggests a general improvement in Ganges water quality during the lockdown in contrast to pre-and-post lockdown periods, potentially caused by reduced effluent. We also demonstrate that land use (agricultural/industrial) and land cover (urban-periurban/rural) in the vicinity of the river reaches seems to have a strong influence on river pollutants. The observations provide a cautious optimistic scenario for potentially developing sustainable drinking water sources in the arsenic-affected Ganges river basin in the future by using these observations as the basis of proper scientifically prudent, spatially adaptive strategies, and technological interventions.","Duttagupta, Srimanti; Bhanja, Soumendra N; Dutta, Avishek; Sarkar, Soumyajit; Chakraborty, Madhumita; Ghosh, Ashok; Mondal, Debapriya; Mukherjee, Abhijit",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),201,24

Discordant findings of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in air samples were noted in early reports. METHODS: Sampling of air close to 6 asymptomatic and symptomatic COVID-19 patients with and without surgical masks was performed with sampling devices using sterile gelatin filters. Frequently touched environmental surfaces near 21 patients were swabbed before daily environmental disinfection. The correlation between the viral loads of patients' clinical samples and environmental samples was analyzed. RESULTS: All air samples were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the 6 patients singly isolated inside airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) with 12 air changes per hour. Of 377 environmental samples near 21 patients, 19 (5.0%) were positive by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay, with a median viral load of 9.2 × 102 copies/mL (range, 1.1 × 102 to 9.4 × 104 copies/mL). The contamination rate was highest on patients' mobile phones (6 of 77, 7.8%), followed by bed rails (4 of 74, 5.4%) and toilet door handles (4 of 76, 5.3%). We detected a significant correlation between viral load ranges in clinical samples and positivity rate of environmental samples (P < .001). CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detectable by air samplers, which suggests that the airborne route is not the predominant mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Wearing a surgical mask, appropriate hand hygiene, and thorough environmental disinfection are sufficient infection control measures for COVID-19 patients isolated singly in AIIRs. However, this conclusion may not apply during aerosol-generating procedures or in cohort wards with large numbers of COVID-19 patients.","Cheng, Vincent Chi-Chung; Wong, Shuk-Ching; Chan, Veronica Wing-Man; So, Simon Yung-Chun; Chen, Jonathan Hon-Kwan; Yip, Cyril Chik-Yan; Chan, Kwok-Hung; Chu, Hin; Chung, Tom Wai-Hin; Sridhar, Siddharth; To, Kelvin Kai-Wang; Chan, Jasper Fuk-Woo; Hung, Ivan Fan-Ngai; Ho, Pak-Leung; Yuen, Kwok-Yung",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,201,26

There were two proposed methodologies in making predictions 28 days ahead for the number of new cases, deaths, and ICU patients of five European countries: Portugal, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, and Germany. A case study of the results of massive immunization in Israel was also considered. The data input of cases, deaths, and daily ICU patients was normalized to reduce discrepant numbers due to the countries’ size and the cumulative vaccination values by the percentage of population immunized (with at least one dose of the vaccine). As a comparative criterion, the calculation of the mean absolute error (MAE) of all predictions presents the best methodology, targeting other possibilities of use for the method proposed. The best architecture achieved a general MAE for the 1-to-28-day ahead forecast, which is lower than 30 cases, 0.6 deaths, and 2.5 ICU patients per million people.","Carvalho, Kathleen Vicente João Paulo Jakovljevic Mihajlo Teixeira João Paulo Ramos",Bioengineering,201,16

The influence of such stressors took place within a broader sociocultural context that needs to be considered. The objective was to examine how the psychological response to the pandemic varied across countries and identify which risk/protective factors contributed to this response. An online survey was conducted from 29 May 2020-12 June 2020, among a multinational sample of 8806 adults from eight countries/regions (Canada, United States, England, Switzerland, Belgium, Hong Kong, Philippines, New Zealand). Probable generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and major depression episode (MDE) were assessed. The independent role of a wide range of potential factors was examined using multilevel logistic regression. Probable GAD and MDE were indicated by 21.0% and 25.5% of the respondents, respectively, with an important variation according to countries/regions (GAD: 12.2-31.0%; MDE: 16.7-32.9%). When considered together, 30.2% of the participants indicated probable GAD or MDE. Several factors were positively associated with a probable GAD or MDE, including (in descending order of importance) weak sense of coherence (SOC), lower age, false beliefs, isolation, threat perceived for oneself/family, mistrust in authorities, stigma, threat perceived for country/world, financial losses, being a female, and having a high level of information about COVID-19. Having a weak SOC yielded the highest adjusted odds ratio for probable GAD or MDE (3.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.73-3.77). This pandemic is having an impact on psychological health. In some places and under certain circumstances, however, people seem to be better protected psychologically. This is a unique opportunity to evaluate the psychosocial impacts across various sociocultural backgrounds, providing important lessons that could inform all phases of disaster risk management.","Généreux, Mélissa; Schluter, Philip J; Hung, Kevin Kc; Wong, Chi Shing; Pui Yin Mok, Catherine; O039,; Sullivan, Tracey; David, Marc D; Carignan, Marie-Eve; Blouin-Genest, Gabriel; Champagne-Poirier, Olivier; Champagne, Éric; Burlone, Nathalie; Qadar, Zeeshan; Herbosa, Teodoro; Ribeiro-Alves, Gleisse; Law, Ronald; Murray, Virginia; Chan, Emily Ying Yang; Pignard-Cheynel, Nathalie; Salerno, Sébastien; Lits, Grégoire; d039,; Haenens, Leen; Coninck, David De; Matthys, Koenraad; Roy, Mathieu",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),201,16

Therefore, we analyzed the impact of social distancing and loneliness in suicidal ideation. METHODS: We performed two waves of a snowball sample, web-based survey in Brazil (W1: from May 6th to June 6th, 2020; W2: from June 6th to July 6th, 2020). We assessed whether risk factors related to social relationships (loneliness, living alone, not leaving home, and the number of days practicing social distancing) at W1 were associated with suicidal ideation at W1 and W2 using multiple regression models. Analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic, mental health, and lifestyle variables. RESULTS: A total of 1,674 (18-75 years old; 86.5% females) were included in our longitudinal sample. Living alone (OR: 1.16; 95%CI = 1.03 - 1.30; p=0.015), number of days practicing social distancing (OR: 1.002; 95%CI = 1.000 - 1.004; p=0.027), and loneliness (OR: 1.49; 95%CI = 1.32 - 1.68; p<0.001) were associated with suicidal ideation in the cross-sectional analysis of W1. Only loneliness (OR= 2.12; 95%CI = 1.06 - 4.24; p = 0.033) remained significant as a risk factor to suicidal ideation in the longitudinal analysis between both waves. LIMITATION: Snowball, convenience sample design limits outcome estimates. Assessments were not objectively performed. CONCLUSION: Loneliness was consistently associated with the incidence of suicidal ideation, while other variables, such as living alone, not leaving home, and the number of days practicing social distancing, were not.

In this article, we provide a preliminary phylodynamic and phylogeographic analysis of this new virus. A Maximum Clade Credibility tree has been built using the 29 available whole genome sequences of 2019-nCoV and two whole genome sequences that are highly similar sequences from Bat SARS-like Coronavirus available in GeneBank. We are able to clarify the mechanism of transmission among the countries which have provided the 2019-nCoV sequence isolates from their patients. The Bayesian phylogeographic reconstruction shows that the 2019-2020 nCoV most probably originated from the Bat SARS-like Coronavirus circulating in the Rhinolophus bat family. In agreement with epidemiological observations, the most likely geographic origin of the new outbreak was the city of Wuhan, China, where 2019-nCoV time of the most recent common ancestor emerged, according to molecular clock analysis, around November 25th, 2019.

In this study, we aim to share our experience of telemedicine in our pediatric endocrinology clinic during the pandemic. METHODS: We were able to continue caring for children with endocrine disorders using various communication methods such as e-mail and e-message. RESULTS: A total of 267 patients received telemedicine care over the course of 608 contacts. The number of hospital visits and physical contact was effectively reduced to help protect against the COVID-19 infection. The patients were supported in terms of receiving their prescriptions and patient education also continued. No complications were observed. CONCLUSION: The advantages and disadvantages of telemedicine were discussed and consequently, we propose that telemedicine can be utilized to maintain and continue the care of children with endocrine disorders during and even after the pandemic. Further studies are needed to standardize this method for general use.","Denkboy Ongen, Yasemin; Eren, Erdal; Sahin, Kadriye Cansu; Buhur Pirimoglu, Meltem; Saglam, Halil; Tarim, Omer",Ir. j. med. sci,201,9

To address the problem, in this paper, we present Holmes, an efficient and lightweight semantic based engine for anomalous email detection. Holmes can convert each event log of email to a sentence through word embedding then extract interesting items among them by novelty detection. Based on our observations, we claim that, in an enterprise environment, there is a stable relation between senders and receivers, but suspicious emails are commonly from unusual sources, which can be detected through the rareness selection. We evaluate the performance of Holmes in a real-world enterprise environment, in which it sends and receives around 5,000 emails each day. As a result, Holmes can achieve a high detection rate (output around 200 suspicious emails per day) and maintain a low false alarm rate for anomaly detection.","Wu, Peilun; Yan, Fan; Guo, Hui",,201,24

These include how host genetic factors affect disease susceptibility and pathogenesis. New work is emerging related to SARS-CoV-2; previous work has been conducted on other coronaviruses that affect different species. We reviewed the literature on host genetic factors related to coronaviruses, systematically focusing on human studies. We identified 1,832 articles of potential relevance. Seventy-five involved human host genetic factors, 36 of which involved analysis of specific genes or loci; aside from one meta-analysis, all were candidate-driven studies, typically investigating small numbers of research subjects and loci. Three additional case reports were described. Multiple significant loci were identified, including 16 related to susceptibility (seven of which identified protective alleles) and 16 related to outcomes (three of which identified protective alleles). The types of cases and controls used varied considerably; four studies used traditional replication/validation cohorts. Among other studies, 30 involved both human and non-human host genetic factors related to coronavirus, 178 involved study of non-human (animal) host genetic factors related to coronavirus, and 984 involved study of non-genetic host factors related to coronavirus, including involving immunopathogenesis. Previous human studies have been limited by issues that may be less impactful now, including low numbers of eligible participants and limited availability of advanced genomic methods; however, these may raise additional considerations. We outline key genes and loci from animal and human host genetic studies that may bear investigation in the study of COVID-19.

The mortality rates vary across the countries probably due to the heterogeneity in study characteristics and patient cohorts as well as treatment strategies. Therefore, we aimed to summarize the clinical characteristics and outcomes of adult patients hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia in Istanbul, Turkey. METHODS: A total of 722 adult patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were analyzed in this single-center retrospective study between March 15 and May 1, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 722 laboratory-confirmed patients with COVID-19 pneumonia were included in the study. There were 235 (32.5%) elderly patients and 487 (67.5%) non-elderly patients. The most common comorbidities were hypertension (251 [34.8%]), diabetes mellitus (198 [27.4%]), and ischemic heart disease (66 [9.1%]). The most common symptoms were cough (512 [70.9%]), followed by fever (226 [31.3%]), and shortness of breath (201 [27.8%]). Lymphocytopenia was present in 29.7% of the patients, leukopenia in 12.2%, and elevated CRP in 48.8%. By the end of May 20, 648 (89.7%) patients had been discharged and 60 (8.5%) patients had died.

This resulted in school closures forcing children to remain at home. Dental-facial trauma was still likely to be common place due to falls and injuries exercising. The aim of this study was to explore the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on clinical practice in a paediatric population in a tertiary care hospital and a linked Dental Institute. METHOD: A proforma was designed to capture the demographics, presenting complaints, type of dental-facial injury, treatment need and the treatment received for all paediatric patients presenting face to face with dental-facial trauma to King's College Hospital during the 'lockdown' period (23 March- 14 June 2020). RESULTS: Four hundred and twenty calls were triaged, converting to 102 patients seen face-to-face for dental-facial trauma. The remainder were able to be triaged 'virtually'. Injuries seen included 56 (54.9%) dentoalveolar injuries, 37 (36.2%) lacerations, five (4.9%) suspected facial fractures and four (3.9%) dog bites. Males and females were equally affected. The majority of incidents occurred in the home environment (n = 60, 58.8%), with the remainder (n = 42, 41.2%) occurring outside the home environment. The main causes of dental-facial trauma were falls (n = 47, 46.1%) and bicycles/scooters (n = 29, 28.4%). The most common type of dentoalveolar injury was lateral luxation (n = 15, 26.7%), followed by avulsion (n = 12, 21.4%). Only one child required treatment under general anaesthesia (GA). CONCLUSION: The demographic, presenting complaints and treatment needs of patients who presented during the lockdown period with dental-facial trauma were unusual. The overwhelming majority were able to be treated without the use of GA. The attendance protocol in a tertiary care setting and the use of 'teledentistry' ensured only the most severe trauma cases were seen. This highlights how more complex trauma can still occur during 'lockdown' and requires immediate management.","Ilyas, Nabeel; Green, Alexandra; Karia, Rishikesh; Sood, Sanjeev; Fan, Kathleen",Dent. traumatol,201,16

Several single-center studies have reported worse outcomes, but no state-level data is available. We aimed to determine the statewide effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the presentation and management of pediatric appendicitis patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients < 18 years old with acute appendicitis at four tertiary pediatric hospitals in California between March 19, 2020 to September 19, 2020 (COVID-era) were compared to a pre-COVID cohort (March 19, 2019 to September 19, 2019). The primary outcome was the rate of perforated appendicitis. Secondary outcomes were symptom duration prior to presentation, and rates of non-operative management. RESULTS: Rates of perforated appendicitis were unchanged (40.4% of 592 patients pre-COVID versus 42.1% of 606 patients COVID-era, P = 0.17). The median symptom duration was 2 days in both cohorts (P = 0.90). Computed tomography (CT) use rose from 39.8% pre-COVID to 49.4% during COVID (P = 0.002). Non-operative management increased during the pandemic (8.8% pre-COVID versus 16.2% COVID-era, P < 0.0001).

A cohort of 1186 subjects, from the GEN-COVID consortium, infected by SARS-CoV-2 with different severity was stratified by sex and adjusted by age. Then, common coding variants from whole exome sequencing were mined by LASSO logistic regression. The homozygosity of the cell adhesion molecule P-selectin gene (SELP) rs6127 (c.1807G > A; p.Asp603Asn) which has been already associated with thrombotic risk is found to be associated with severity in the male subcohort of 513 subjects (odds ratio = 2.27, 95% Confidence Interval 1.54-3.36). As the SELP gene is downregulated by testosterone, the odd ratio is increased in males older than 50 (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.53-3.82). Asn/Asn homozygotes have increased D-dimers values especially when associated with poly Q &#8805; 23 in the androgen receptor (OR 3.26, 95% CI 1.41-7.52).

Cancer patients including BC have been reported to be at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is mostly attributed to the chronic immunosuppressive status of cancer patients along with the use of cytotoxic drugs. Here in this review, we highlighted the role of dyslipidemia associated with BC patients in the incidence and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Elevated levels of lipids namely phospholipids, cholesterol, sphingolipids, and eicosanoids in the serum of BC patients and their re-localization to the alveolar spaces can increase susceptibility and/or severity due to SARA-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, manipulation of dyslipidemia in BC patients should be recommended as prophylactic and therapy against SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Shakartalla, Sarra B; Alhumaidi, Razan B; Shammout, Ola D A; Al Shareef, Zainab M; Ashmawy, Naglaa S; Soliman, Sameh S M",Infect Genet Evol,201,8

Upon the arrival of military medical assets to the Javits Convention Center in NYC, the planned mission to care for non-SARS-CoV-2 patients was immediately changed to manage patients with (SARS-CoV-2)COVID-19 and their comorbid conditions.Healthcare professionals from every branch of the uniformed services, augmented by state and local resources, staffed the Javits New York Medical Station (JNYMS) from April 2020. METHODS: The data review reported aggregated summary statistics and participant observations collected by N.Y. State and U.S. military officials. RESULTS: During the 28 days of patient intake at the JNYMS, 1,095 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients were transferred from NYC hospitals to the JNYMS. At its peak, the JNYMS accepted 119 patients in a single day, had a maximum census of 453, and had a peak intensive care unit census of 35. The median length of stay was 4.6 days (interquartile range: 3.1-6.9 days). A total of 103 patients were transferred back to local hospitals, and there were 6 deaths, with an overall mortality rate of 0.6% (95% CI, 0.3-1.2). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the care provided at the JNYMS. Within 2 weeks, this multi-agency effort was able to mobilize to care for over 1,000 SARS-CoV-2 patients with varying degrees of illness in a 1-month period. This was the largest field hospital mobilization in the U.S. medical history in response to a non-wartime pandemic. Its success with huge patient throughput including disposition and low mortality relieved critical overcrowding and supply deficiencies throughout NYC hospitals. The downstream impact likely saved additional hundreds of lives and reduced stress on the system during this healthcare crisis.","Brady, Kevin; Milzman, Dave; Walton, Edward; Sommer, Darren; Neustadtl, Alan; Napoli, Anthony",Mil. med,201,4

AIM: To explore how general practitioners (GPs) experienced discussing values, goals and preferences with patients during COVID-19. DESIGN AND SETTING: Qualitative research in general practice. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews for which Dutch GPs were recruited via purposive sampling. Content analysis was used. RESULTS: Fifteen GPs were interviewed. Six themes were identified: (i) urge of advance care planning, (ii) the GP's perceived role in it, (iii) preparations for it, (iv) (proactively) discussing it, (v) essentials for good communication and (vi) advance care planning in the (near) future. Calls for proactively discussing advance care planning in the media and in COVID-guidelines caused awareness of it's importance. GPs envisaged an important role for themselves in initiating it, especially with patients at risk to deteriorate or die from COVID-19. Timing advance care planning appeared difficult but crucial. The recommended digital way of communication was considered problematic due to missing nonverbal communication and difficulties in involving relatives. It was noted that admission to the ICU, which was hardly discussed before the COVID-19 pandemic, should remain a topic during advance care planning. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic brought advance care planning into a new light, GPs were more experienced with discussing it and patients were more aware of their frailty. Because of the nearing 'grey wave', advance care planning should remain top priority. Therefore, it should be central in GP and post-academic training.","Dujardin, Janneke; Schuurmans, Jaap; Westerduin, Dieke; Wichmann, Anne B; Engels, Yvonne",Palliat Med,201,1

Although the underlying mechanisms are still unknown, MIS-C is thought to be primarily immune-mediated. Here, we describe an atypical, severe form of MIS-C in two infant girls with DS who were hospitalized for over 4 months. Immunological evaluation revealed pronounced neutrophilia, B cell depletion, increased circulating IL-6 and IL-8, and elevated markers of immune activation ICAM1 and FcÉ£RI. Importantly, uninfected children with DS presented with similar but less stark immune features at steady state, possibly explaining risk of further uncontrolled inflammation following SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Methods: This is a nested case-control study in which we compared male participants with extreme phenotype selected from the Italian GEN-COVID cohort of SARS-CoV-2-infected participants (<60 y, 79 severe cases versus 77 control cases). We applied the LASSO Logistic Regression analysis, considering only rare variants on young male subsets with extreme phenotype, picking up TLR7 as the most important susceptibility gene. Results: Overall, we found TLR7 deleterious variants in 2.1% of severely affected males and in none of the asymptomatic participants. The functional gene expression profile analysis demonstrated a reduction in TLR7-related gene expression in patients compared with controls demonstrating an impairment in type I and II IFN responses. Conclusions: Young males with TLR7 loss-of-function variants and severe COVID-19 represent a subset of male patients contributing to disease susceptibility in up to 2% of severe COVID-19.

Diabetes, especially when uncontrolled, is also recognized as an important risk factor for COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, certain inflammatory markers [i.e. C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and ferritin] were reported as strong predictors of worse outcomes in COVID-19 positive patients. The same biomarkers have been associated with poor glycemic control. Therefore, achieving euglycemia in patients with diabetes is even more important in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the above, it is clinically interesting to elucidate whether antidiabetic drugs may reduce inflammation, thus possibly minimizing the risk for COVID-19 development and severity. The present narrative review discusses the potential anti-inflammatory properties of certain antidiabetic drugs (i.e. metformin, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, linagliptin, vildagliptin, alogliptin, saxagliptin, liraglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide, lixisenatide, semaglutide, empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin), with a focus on CRP, IL-6 and ferritin.","Katsiki, Niki; Ferrannini, Ele",J Diabetes Complications,201,18

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two uncooperative patients, attending primary and secondary schools, were submitted to emergency dental treatments with inhalation conscious sedation using nitrous oxide and oxygen during COVID-19 pandemic. Collected data included: number of working sessions, success/failure, adverse events, side effects, number of teeth treated; type of dental procedure. Parents filled in an e-mailed questionnaire on post-discharge children status to evaluate: pain; crying; fever; vomiting; headache; drowsiness; excitability; irritability; ability to eat; need for drugs. RESULTS: One working session was carried out in 29 patients, 2 working sessions were carried out in 6 patients and 3 working sessions were carried out in 7 patients. Success rate was 87.1%. In relation to success, there was no statistically significant difference between males and females, healthy and disabled patients, respectively; while there was a statistically significant difference between patients attending primary and secondary schools (p=0.023). No adverse events occurred. The most frequent side effect was nausea. In relation to side effects, there was no statistically significant difference between males and females, healthy and disabled patients, patients attending primary and secondary schools, respectively.

We aimed to examine risk factors for COVID-19 death. METHODS: A total of 80 543 COVID-19 cases reported in China, nationwide, through April 8, 2020 were included. Risk factors for death were investigated by Cox proportional hazards regression and stratified analyses. RESULTS: Overall national case fatality ratio (CFR) was 5.64%. Risk factors for death were older age (&#8805;80: adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]=12.58, 95% confidence interval [CI]=6.78-23.33), presence of underlying disease (aHR=1.33, CI=1.19-1.49), worse case severity (severe: aHR=3.86, CI=3.15-4.73; critical: aHR=11.34, CI=9.22-13.95), and near-epicenter region (Hubei: aHR=2.64, CI=2.11-3.30; Wuhan: aHR=6.35, CI=5.04-8.00). CFR increased from 0.35% (30-39 years) to 18.21% (&#8805;70 years) without underlying disease. Regardless of age, CFR increased from 2.50% for no underlying disease to 7.72% for 1, 13.99% for 2, and 21.99% for &#8805;3. CFR increased with worse case severity from 2.80% (mild), to 12.51% (severe) and 48.60% (critical) regardless of region. Compared to other regions, CFR was much higher in Wuhan regardless of case severity (mild: 3.83% versus 0.14% in Hubei and 0.03% elsewhere; moderate: 4.60% versus 0.21% and 0.06%; severe: 15.92% versus 5.84% and 1.86%; and critical: 58.57% versus 49.80% and 18.39%). CONCLUSIONS: Older patients regardless of underlying disease and patients with underlying disease regardless of age were at elevated risk of death. Higher death rates near the outbreak epicenter and during the surge of cases reflect the deleterious effects of allowing health systems to become overwhelmed.","Zhang, Yanping; Luo, Wei; Li, Qun; Wang, Xijie; Chen, Jin; Song, Qinfeng; Tu, Hong; Ren, Ruiqi; Li, Chao; Li, Dan; Zhao, Jing; McGoogan, Jennifer M; Shan, Duo; Li, Bing; Zhang, Jingxue; Dong, Yanhui; Jin, Yu; Mao, Shuai; Qian, Menbao; Lv, Chao; Zhu, Huihui; Wang, Limin; Xiao, Lin; Xu, Juan; Yin, Dapeng; Zhou, Lei; Li, Zhongjie; Shi, Guoqing; Dong, Xiaoping; Guan, Xuhua; Gao, George F; Wu, Zunyou; Feng, Zijian",Clin. infect. dis,201,1

Increasingly, connectivity is of vital importance for school, work, family, and friends. Existing international research on the implementation of broadband has studied its adoption patterns with a focus on the rural/urban digital divide. This paper explores the digital divide in a case study of the seventh largest city, by population, in the United States; San Antonio is a majority-minority city where over half of the people are Hispanic. This paper focuses on the five key affordability factors that drive broadband adoption. Researchers test social exclusion theory, the structural facets of poverty and social marginality to ascertain its potential impact on broadband access. The authors conducted a survey in both English and Spanish to learn more about the affordability factors that influence the broadband digital divide. Through our analysis, we found evidence that four of the factors (geographical disparities, profit-based discrimination, technology deployment cost, and socio-economic factors) played a role in the digital divide in this case study. The results of this study demonstrate that the digital divide is not exclusively a rural/urban digital divide, but can also occur in an intra-city context. This is especially evident in low-income areas within the city because they have substantially lower broadband adoption rates. The results of this study demonstrate the importance of looking closely at issues of social exclusion of marginalized groups and the affordability of broadband access intra-city.","Reddick, Christopher G.; Enriquez, Roger; Harris, Richard J.; Sharma, Bonita",Cities,201,16

METHODS: Twelve patients with IRVF (aged 3-5 months) underwent LAARP from 2017 to 2019 in our institute. LAARP was performed for mobilization of the rectum, visualization and enlargement of the center of the sphincter muscle complex (SMC) from pelvic and perineal aspects, intra-fistula mucosectomy and rectal pull-through in the SMC with the fourchette and the perineal body unattached. RESULTS: LARRP was performed in all patients without conversion to open procedure. No patient suffered from wound infection, vaginal injury, recurrent fistula and anal stenosis. The parents were satisfied with the appearance of the wound. Rectal prolapse developed in one patient and needed surgical correction. The patients were followed up for a mean of 19.7 months (ranged from 12 to 35 months).

Furthermore, to explore characteristics of patients with/without physical consultations in the clinic, and impact of early versus established disease. METHODS: Patients with rheumatoid arthritis(RA)/psoriatic arthritis(PsA)/axial spondyloarthritis(AxSpA) prospectively followed in the nationwide DANBIO-registry answered online questionnaires and reported patient reported outcomes (PROs) in June and November 2020. Patient characteristics, disease activity and physical consultations in the clinic before and during the pandemic were identified in DANBIO (all patients and subgroup with early disease (disease duration &#8804;2 years)). In individual patients, changes in PROs before and during the pandemic were calculated. Characteristics of patients with/without physical consultations were described (age/gender/educational level/comorbidities/disease duration/treatment). RESULTS: We included 7,836 patients (22% of eligible patients) whereof 12% had early disease. PROs were stable before and during the pandemic with median changes approximating zero, also in patients with early disease. Remission rates were stable. The relative decrease in number of patients with physical consultations was 21-72%, highest in AxSpA. Characteristics of patients with/without physical consultations were similar.

Historically and currently, many racial and ethnic and minority groups are under-represented within the health profession workforce, a situation that has exacerbated disparities in access and quality of care in these communities.3,4,5 African Americans make up 13% of the U.S. population but constitute only 6.9% of U.S. advanced practice nurses (nurse practitioners and nurse midwives) and 4% of U.S. physicians.1 Of actively practicing advanced practice nurses in the U.S. in 2018, 81.8% were White, 7.9% were Asian, and 0.2% were American Indian or Alaska Native.1 The disparities among groups are most glaring in states such as California where the Latinx population constitutes 40% of the population, yet only 5% of the physician workforce.6 These statistics stand in contrast to statistics on the workforce of clinicians that represents the NHSC: 13% are African American, 10% are Latinx, 7% are Asian or Pacific Islander, and 2% are American Indian or Alaska Native.

More importantly, this endeavor is especially suited for the European Union (EU) member states, which account for a sizable portion of the world economy. However, by considering the open border or trade policy approach of the bloc, this study applies a battery of econometrics analysis that consists of mean group, augmented mean group, common correlated effect mean group estimators, and Dumitrescu and Hurlin causality analysis for direction of causality. These techniques are superior to first-generation methods to substantiate the relationship between real income, energy intensity, and carbon emission between annual frequency data from 1990 to 2017. Empirical results from series of cointegration tests reveal the long-run equilibrium relationship between the highlighted variables in the EU. Our study validates the existence of EKC phenomenon where emphasis is based on GDP growth at the expense of environmental quality. This implies that EU growth trajectory comes with an environmental trade-off and consequences. However, few countries in the region have made substantial strides of carbon reduction but not as a bloc. This position is resonated by the regression from all estimators in harmony where energy intensity dampens environmental quality in the blocs investigated. On the direction of causality, feedback Granger causality is observed running from GDP growth and carbon emission. A similar direction of causality is seen between energy intensity and carbon emission. These outcomes have far-reaching consequences on the environment. This study recommends the need for energy transition to cleaner and friendlier energy technologies by EU officials. That is, the need for a paradigm shift from conventional energy based on fossil fuel to renewable energy should be pursued in the region. More policy directions are outlined in the concluding section.","Bekun, Festus Victor; Alola, Andrew Adewale; Gyamfi, Bright Akwasi; Yaw, Sarpong Steve",Environ. sci. pollut. res. int.

The encouraging results positioned MSCs as a possible cell therapy for COVID-19. The amniotic membrane from the human placenta at term is a valuable stem cell source, including human amniotic epithelial cells (hAECs) and human mesenchymal stromal cells (hAMSCs). Interestingly, amnion cells have immunoregulatory, regenerative, and anti-inflammatory properties. Moreover, hAECs and hAMSCs have been used both in preclinical studies and in clinical trials against respiratory diseases. They have reduced the inflammatory response and restored the pulmonary tissue architecture in lung injury in vivo models. Here, we review the existing data about the stem cells use for COVID-19 treatment, including the ongoing clinical trials. We also consider the non-cellular therapies that are being applied. Finally, we discuss the human amniotic membrane cells use in patients who suffer from immune/inflammatory lung diseases and hypothesize their possible use as a successful treatment against COVID-19.","Riedel, Rodrigo N; Pérez-Pérez, Antonio; Sánchez-Margalet, Víctor; Varone, Cecilia L; Maymó, Julieta L",Stem Cell Res Ther,201,17

In addition, there is scant evidence about the clinical outcomes of patients with AMI and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The objective of this study was to describe the clinical presentation, complications, and risk factors for mortality in patients admitted for AMI during the COVID-19 pandemic.Methods This prospective, multicenter, cohort study included all consecutive patients with AMI who underwent coronary angiography in a 30-day period corresponding chronologically with the COVID-19 outbreak (March 15 to April 15, 2020). Clinical presentations and outcomes were compared between COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 patients. The effect of COVID-19 on mortality was assessed by propensity score matching and with a multivariate logistic regression model.Results In total, 187 patients were admitted for AMI, 111 with ST-segment elevation AMI and 76 with non-ST-segment elevation AMI. Of these, 32 (17%) were diagnosed with COVID-19. GRACE score, Killip-Kimball classification, and several inflammatory markers were significantly higher in COVID-19-positive patients. Total and cardiovascular mortality were also significantly higher in COVID-19-positive patients (25% vs 3.8% [P < .001] and 15.2% vs 1.8% [P = .001], respectively). GRACE score > 140 (OR, 23.45; 95%CI, 2.52-62.51; P = .005) and COVID-19 (OR, 6.61; 95%CI, 1.82-24.43; P = .02) were independent predictors of in-hospital death.Conclusions During this pandemic, a high GRACE score and COVID-19 were independent risk factors associated with higher in-hospital mortality.","Solano-López, Jorge; Luis Zamorano, José; Sanz, Ana Pardo; Amat-Santos, Ignacio; Sarnago, Fernando; Ibañes, Enrique Gutiérrez; Sanchis, Juan; Blas, Juan Ramón Rey; Gómez-Hospital, Joan Antoni; Martínez, Sandra Santos; Maneiro-Melón, Nicolás Manuel; Gaitán, Roberto Mateos; D039,; Gregorio, Jessika González; Salido, Luisa; Mestre, José L; Sanmartín, Marcelo; Sánchez-Recalde, Ángel",Rev. esp. cardiol.

Multiple organ damage can occur rapidly in patients infected with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Previous studies have shown that many laboratory biomarkers were not within the normal ranges in COVID-19 patients. We aimed to summarize laboratory parameters and the tumor markers in COVID-19 patients. This is a retrospective cohort study conducted on 53 women between the ages of 19-85 years infected with COVID-19 at a training and research hospital between May 2020 and August 2020. Of the 53 women, 16 (30.2%) had leukopenia. The mean C-reactive protein level was 18.42 ± 59.33 mg/L. The mean procalcitonin level was 0.1 ± 0.21 µg/L. The liver function tests were within normal limits. The mean creatinine level was 0.58 ± 0.37 mg/dl. Elevated levels of &#945;-fetoprotein (AFP) in 1 patient, elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in 2 patients, elevated levels of cancer antigen 125 (CA125) in 4 patients, elevated levels of CA19-9 in 2 patients, and elevated levels of CA15-3 in 2 patients were detected. One of 4 patients who were taken to the intensive care unit had elevated levels of AFP. In addition, 2 of 4 patients who were taken to the intensive care unit had elevated levels of CA125 and CA15-3. Except for AFP, levels of all tumor markers of the patient who died were high.

We used qualitative methods to gain an understanding of the social context within which SSPs are operating during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted 36 in-depth interviews with program representatives from 18 programs and used the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) implementation framework to guide data analysis. We focused on 3 of the 4 EPIS constructs: Outer context, inner context, and innovation factors. Our data indicate that responding to the pandemic led to innovations in service delivery such as secondary and mail-based distribution, adoption of telemedicine for enrolling participants in medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) and use of virtual training platforms for overdose prevention. We found high levels of staff and volunteer commitment, which was a cornerstone to the success of these innovations. We observed that many SSPs were short-staffed because of their commitment to safety, and some lost current funding as well as opportunities for future funding. Despite minimal staffing and diminished funding, SSPs innovated at an accelerated pace. To ensure the sustainability of these new approaches, a supportive external context (federal, state, and local policies and funding) is needed to support the development of SSPs' inner contexts (organizational characteristics, characteristics of individuals) and sustainment of the innovations achieved regarding delivery of naloxone and MOUD.","Wenger, Lynn D; Kral, Alex H; Bluthenthal, Ricky N; Morris, Terry; Ongais, Lee; Lambdin, Barrot H",Transl Res,201,33

This study was aimed to summarize the patterns and determinants of coronavirus disease 2019 knowledge, attitude, and practice among general populations and health workers. Methods: A cross-sectional study from PubMed, HINARI, and Scopus were searched from March 16 to July 30, 2020. The review was done in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses-2009. Result: We found 56 articles upon the initial search. Finally, 21 studies were filtered to be studied in this systematic review. Overall, the majority of the articles that were previously published had good knowledge about coronavirus disease 2019 that lies in the ranges from 40% to 99.5%. A good attitude lies in the ranges from 70% to 97.1%. Among impact of coronavirus disease 2019 on mental health, only anxiety was reported that ranges from 24.6% to 96.3%. We found the variable practice towards combating coronavirus disease 2019. Several factors were associated with poor knowledge, attitudes, and practice skills regarding the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 such as level of education, occupation, income, gender, age, residence, work experience, religion, having media, marital status, and race. Conclusion: The majority of the articles that were previously published had found good knowledge and attitude about coronavirus disease 2019 and variable reports for practice to combat the disease. Most of them were severely worried about the disease. Therefore, the mental effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 should be studied at large, and every country should implement the strategy to combat the disease to increase the level of practice.","Bekele, Firomsa; Sheleme, Tadesse; Fekadu, Ginenus; Bekele, Kumera",SAGE Open Med,201,16

Systematic storage would facilitate investigation into the origin and prevalence of viruses and other agents. Comparison of prevalence data from individual and clinical samplings with community wastewater would allow valuable comparison, contrast and correlation among different testing modalities. Current interest is focused on SARS-CoV-2, but archived samples could become valuable in many contexts including surveys for other infectious and chemical agents whose identity is not currently known.

Use of real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) helped manage diabetes effectively. Some of these disruptions may be reflected in population-scale changes to metrics of glycemic control, such as time-in-range (TIR). Methods: We examined data from 65,067 U.S.-based users of the G6 rtCGM System (Dexcom, Inc., San Diego, CA) who had uploaded data before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Users associated with three counties that included the cities of Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York or with five regions designated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were compared. Public data were used to associate regions with prepandemic and intrapandemic glycemic parameters, COVID-19 mortality, and median household income. Results: Compared with an 8-week prepandemic interval before stay-at-home orders (January 6, 2020, to March 1, 2020), overall mean (standard deviation) TIR improved from 59.0 (20.1)% to 61.0 (20.4)% during the early pandemic period (April 20, 2020 to June 14, 2020, P < 0.001). TIR improvements were noted in all three counties and in all five CDC-designated regions. Higher COVID-19 mortality was associated with higher proportions of individuals experiencing TIR improvements of &#8805;5 percentage points. Users in economically wealthier zip codes had higher pre- and intrapandemic TIR values and greater relative improvements in TIR. TIR and pandemic-related improvements in TIR varied across CDC-designated regions. Conclusions: Population-level rtCGM data may be used to monitor changes in glycemic control with temporal and geographic specificity. The COVID-19 pandemic is associated with improvements in TIR, which were not evenly distributed across the United States.","van der Linden, Joost; Welsh, John B; Hirsch, Irl B; Garg, Satish K",Diabetes Technol Ther,201,9

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Tertiary level referral audiologic center. METHODS: We assessed the prevalence of OME among children aged 6 months to 12 years who attended the outpatient clinic for hearing or vestibular disorders during 2 periods before the lockdown, May-June 2019 (n = 350) and January-February 2020 (n = 366), and the period immediately after the lockdown, May-June 2020 (n = 216). We also compared the disease resolution rates between a subgroup of children with chronic OME (n = 30) who were diagnosed in summer 2019 and reevaluated in May-June 2020 and a similar subgroup (n = 29) assessed in 2018-2019. RESULTS: The prevalence of OME in this clinic population was 40.6% in May-June 2019, 52.2% in January-February 2020, and 2.3% in May-June 2020. Children with chronic OME had a higher rate of disease resolution in May-June 2020 (93.3%) than those examined in May-June 2019 (20.7%, P < .001). CONCLUSION: Closure of schools and the physical distancing rules were correlated with a reduction in the prevalence of OME and favored the resolution of its chronic forms among children who attended the outpatient clinic. These data could suggest that in the presence of chronic OME, keeping young children out of group care settings for a period might be beneficial to allow for OME resolution.","Aldè, Mirko; Di Berardino, Federica; Marchisio, Paola; Cantarella, Giovanna; Ambrosetti, Umberto; Consonni, Dario; Zanetti, Diego",Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,201,16

The epidemiological case definition for SARS-CoV-2 re-infection was developed from literature review of data on viral kinetics. For achieving second objective, the individuals who satisfied the developed case definition for SARS-CoV-2 re-infection were contacted telephonically. Taking available evidence into consideration, re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 in our study was defined as any individual who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 on two separate occasions by either molecular tests or rapid antigen test at an interval of at least 102 days with one negative molecular test in between. In this archive based, telephonic survey, 58 out of 1300 individuals (4.5%) fulfilled the above-mentioned definition; 38 individuals could be contacted with healthcare workers (HCWs) accounting for 31.6% of the cases. A large proportion of participants was asymptomatic and had higher Ct value during the first episode.

In terms of anatomy, during the abdominal aorta's dissection, it is possible to identify the periaortic adipose tissue and the periaortic parietal peritoneum lying over it, sealing the retroperitoneal space. They seem to be fragile layers, with apparently no biomechanical role in the abdomen. However, it is well known that most cases of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms that reach the emergency department still alive present retroperitoneal bleeding contained by the above-mentioned two-layer combination, eventually allowing time for surgical treatment. In previous studies about aortic wall stress, tension, and abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture prediction, only information concerning the vessel wall itself is highlighted. Therefore, the present work aims to study the biomechanical and histological properties of the periaortic tissue, comparing them to the same variables measured in aortic wall samples described in the medical literature. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Samples of periaortic tissue were harvested from 27 individuals during necropsy. Smoking status and the presence of abdominal aortic aneurysm were observed. Biomechanical uniaxial destructive tests were performed up to samples rupture. Values of failure stress, tension, and strain were obtained. Samples were also harvested for histological analysis. RESULTS: Periaortic tissue presented less amount of collagen in smokers than in non-smokers (p = 0.017). The periaortic tissue seems to be more elastic than aortic walls described in the literature (strain: 0.75 ± 0.37). Analyzing periaortic tissue failure stress (56.8 ± 101.26 N/cm2) and tension (7.65 ± 4.99 N/cm), it has at least 52% and 55%, respectively of the stress and tension described in the medical literature for abdominal aortic aneurysm walls. CONCLUSIONS: The periaortic tissue presents less collagen fibers in smokers than in non-smokers. The periaortic tissue seemed very delicate during an autopsy, but the study of its biomechanical properties showed that it presents more than half of the resistance of an abdominal aortic aneurysm wall. This information suggests this tissue might have a mechanical protective role against massive bleeding when it comes to an aortic rupture. Therefore this tissue's biomechanical information should be included in computational models on enlargement and rupture prediction of abdominal aortic aneurysms.","Gomes, Vivian Carla; Ferraz da Silva, Luiz Fernando; Silvestre, Gina Camillo; Queiroz, Alexandre; Marques, Michele Alberto; Zyngier, Selene Perrotti; Simão da Silva, Erasmo",Ann. vasc. surg,201,24

It is necessary to examine the viral proteins that play a notorious role in the invasion of our body. The main protease (3CLpro) facilitates the maturation of the coronavirus. It is thought that the dimerization of 3CLpro leads to its catalytic activity; the detailed mechanism has, however, not been suggested. Furthermore, the structural differences between the predecessor SARS-CoV 3CLpro and SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro have not been fully understood. Here, we show the structural and dynamical differences between the two main proteases, and demonstrate the relationship between the dimerization and the activity via atomistic molecular dynamics simulations. Simulating monomeric and dimeric 3CLpro systems for each protease, we show that (i) global dynamics between the two different proteases are not conserved, (ii) the dimerization stabilizes the catalytic dyad and hydration water molecules behind the dyad, and (iii) the substrate-binding site (active site) and hydration water molecules in each protomer fluctuate asymmetrically. We then speculate the roles of hydration water molecules in their catalytic activity.","Iida, Shinji; Fukunishi, Yoshifumi",BBA Adv,201,24

In the present study, phytochemicals from spices were assessed for their ability to interact with SARS-CoV-2 MPro. Structure based virtual screening was performed with 146 phytochemicals from spices using Autodock Vina. Phytochemicals with binding energy &#8805; -8.0 kcal/mol were selected to understand their interaction with MPro. Virtual screening was further validated by performing molecular docking to generate favorable docked poses and the participation of important amino acid residues. Molecular dynamics simulation for the docked poses was performed to study thermodynamic properties of the protein, ligand and protein-ligand complexes. The finding shows that cinnamtannin B2 and cyanin showed favorable binding affinity values with SARS-CoV-2 MPro. The results are comparable in terms of docked poses, important amino acid participation and thermodynamic properties with the standard control drugs remdesivir, benazepril and hydroxychloroquine diphosphate. Prime MM-GBSA was employed for end-point binding energy calculation. Binding to domain I and II of MPro were mediated through the OH, SH, NH2 and non-polar side chain of amino acids. Cinnamtannin B2 and cyanin binds to MPro with many sub sites within the active site with RMSD and RMSF within 4 Å. The results computed using Prime MM-GBSA show that cinnamtannin B2 (-68.54940214 kcal/mol) and cyanin (-62.1902835 kcal/mol) have better binding affinity in comparison to hydroxychloroquine diphosphate (-54.00912412 kcal/mol) and benazepril (-53.70242369 kcal/mol).

Patients diagnosed with severe or critical cases have a poor prognosis. Hence, it is crucial for us to identify potentially severe or critical cases early and give timely treatments for targeted patients. In the clinical practice of treating patients with COVID-19, we have observed that the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) of severe patients is higher than that in mild patients. We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the predictive values of NLR on disease severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS: We searched PubMed, EMBASE, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang databases to identify eligible studies (up to August 11, 2020). Two authors independently screened studies and extracted data. The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed by Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2). RESULTS: Thirteen studies involving 1579 patients reported the predictive value of NLR on disease severity. The pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE) and area under curve (AUC) were 0.78 (95% CI 0.70-0.84), 0.78 (95% CI 0.73-0.83) and 0.85 (95% CI 0.81-0.88), respectively. Ten studies involving 2967 patients reported the predictive value of NLR on mortality. The pooled SEN, SPE and AUC were 0.83 (95% CI 0.75-0.89), 0.83 (95% CI 0.74-0.89) and 0.90 (95% CI 0.87-0.92), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: NLR has good predictive values on disease severity and mortality in patients with COVID-19 infection. Evaluating NLR can help clinicians identify potentially severe cases early, conduct early triage and initiate effective management in time, which may reduce the overall mortality of COVID-19. TRIAL REGISTRY: This meta-analysis was prospectively registered on PROSPERO database (Registration number: CRD42020203612).","Li, Xiaoming; Liu, Chao; Mao, Zhi; Xiao, Minglu; Wang, Li; Qi, Shuang; Zhou, Feihu",Crit Care,201,32

In order to balance epidemic control and economic recovery, many countries have successively announced the gradual relaxation of some lockdown restrictions. Hospitals and medical staff constitute the backbone in this war against COVID-19. In response to this serious situation, many hospitals went into emergency and impaired healthcare access to patients with conditions other than COVID-19. Therefore, gradually promoting hospital operations and functions back to the new normal is important, especially when this outbreak has been effectively controlled. In this study, we introduce existing and potential problems that could seriously affect people's health. Additionally, we propose that an especial transition phase between the emergency and regular modes of hospitals can be well adapted to the current situation.","Liu, Xiucheng; Zhuang, Wei; Quan, Xiaoyu; Zhou, Yeqing; Qin, Hao; Zou, Chenghang; Zhang, Hao",Environ Health Prev Med,201,16

During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the Israeli Ministry of Health initially mandated that all psychological assessments be postponed. However, as referrals to time-sensitive, high-need, and high-stakes assessments began to accumulate, it became necessary to consider remote solutions. In the current paper, we describe the considerations that affected the transition to remote activity in a prominent Israeli provider of neuropsychological assessment and rehabilitation services, referring to technological and environmental conditions, cognitive requirements, and tasks, as well as to legal, regulatory, and funding issues. After discussing how assessments should be conducted to maximize feasibility and validity while minimizing risks to clients and clinicians, we propose a preliminary model for deciding whether specific referrals warrant remote administration. The model delineates key factors in decisions regarding remote assessment, emphasizing the distinct roles of the referring clinician and the neuropsychologist who conducts the assessment, and highlighting the need for collaboration between them. The abrupt need for remote assessments during the pandemic required a quick response with little preparation. The lessons learned from this process can be applied in the future, so that the need for remote services can be met with greater certainty and uniformity.","Bloch, Ayala; Maril, Sari; Kavé, Gitit",Isr J Health Policy Res,201,16

However, little is known regarding the impact on semen parameters and fertility potential. We sought to investigate for presence of viral RNA in semen of men with SARS-CoV-2 infection and to evaluate its effect on semen parameters in ejaculate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively recruited thirty men diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of pharyngeal swab specimens. Semen samples were collected from each individual using mailed kits. Follow-up semen samples were done with mailed kits or in-person in office setting. Semen analysis and PCR was performed after samples were received. RESULTS: Thirty semen samples from recovered men were obtained 11-64 days after testing positive for SAR-CoV-2 infection. The median duration between positive SAR-CoV-2 test and semen collection was 37 days (interquartile range [IQR]=23). The median total sperm number (TSN) in ejaculate was 12.5 million (IQR=52.1). When compared with age-matched SARS-CoV-2(-) men, TSN was lower among SARS-CoV-2(+) men (p=0.0024). Five men completed a follow-up sperm analysis (median 3 months) and had a median TSN of 18 million (IQR=21.6). No RNA was detected by means of RT-PCR in the semen in 16 samples tested.

METHODS: Pregnant women with COVID-19 delivering between March 18, 2020, and May 5, 2020, were identified. Placentas were examined and compared to historical controls and women with placental evaluation for a history of melanoma. RESULTS: Sixteen placentas from patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) were examined (15 with live birth in the third trimester, 1 delivered in the second trimester after intrauterine fetal demise). Compared to controls, third trimester placentas were significantly more likely to show at least one feature of maternal vascular malperfusion (MVM), particularly abnormal or injured maternal vessels, and intervillous thrombi. Rates of acute and chronic inflammation were not increased.The placenta from the patient with intrauterine fetal demise showed villous edema and a retroplacental hematoma. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to controls, COVID-19 placentas show increased prevalence of decidual arteriopathy and other features of MVM, a pattern of placental injury reflecting abnormalities in oxygenation within the intervillous space associated with adverse perinatal outcomes. Only 1 COVID-19 patient was hypertensive despite the association of MVM with hypertensive disorders and preeclampsia.

An essay on the effects of dexamethasone and the potential risks of its inadvertent use in patients with diabetes,20.131666,8.553922,2020,"Ubiquitous mobile computing have enabled ride-hailing services to collect vast amounts of behavioral data of riders and drivers and optimize supply and demand matching in real time. While these mobility service providers have some degree of control over the market by assigning vehicles to requests, they need to deal with the uncertainty arising from self-interested driver behavior since workers are usually free to drive when they are not assigned tasks. In this work, we formulate the problem of passenger-vehicle matching in a sparsely connected graph and proposed an algorithm to derive an equilibrium policy in a multi-agent environment. Our framework combines value iteration methods to estimate the optimal policy given expected state visitation and policy propagation to compute multi-agent state visitation frequencies. Furthermore, we developed a method to learn the driver's reward function transferable to an environment with significantly different dynamics from training data. We evaluated the robustness to changes in spatio-temporal supply-demand distributions and deterioration in data quality using a real-world taxi trajectory dataset; our approach significantly outperforms several baselines in terms of imitation accuracy. The computational time required to obtain an equilibrium policy shared by all vehicles does not depend on the number of agents, and even on the scale of real-world services, it takes only a few seconds on a single CPU.","Oda, Takuma",,201,16

Objective: In this cohort study, we aimed to report the disease characteristics and variables associated with COVID-19 outcome among Turkish patients with IRDs. Methods: Between April and June, 2020, 167 adult IRD patients with COVID-19 were registered from 31 centers in 14 cities in Turkey. Disease outcome was classified in 4 categories; (i) outpatient management, (ii) hospitalization without oxygen requirement, (iii) hospitalization with oxygen requirement, and (iv) intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analysis was conducted to determine variables associated with a worse outcome. Results: 165 patients (mean age: 50 ± 15.6 years, 58.2% female) were included. Twenty-four patients (14.5%) recovered under outpatient management, 141 (85.5%) were hospitalized, 49 (30%) required inpatient oxygen support, 22 (13%) were treated in the ICU (17 received invasive mechanic ventilation) and 16 (10%) died. Glucocorticoid use (OR: 4.53, 95%CI 1.65-12.76), chronic kidney disease (OR: 12.8, 95%CI 2.25-103.5), pulmonary disease (OR: 2.66, 95%CI 1.08-6.61) and obesity (OR: 3.7, 95%CI 1.01-13.87) were associated with a worse outcome. Biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) do not seem to affect COVID-19 outcome while conventional synthetic DMARDs may have a protective effect (OR: 0.36, 95%CI 0.17-0.75). Estimates for the associations between IRD diagnoses and outcome were inconclusive. Conclusions: Among IRD patients with COVID-19, comorbidities and glucocorticoid use were associated with a worse outcome, while biologic DMARDs do not seem to be associated with a worse outcome.","Esatoglu, Sinem Nihal; Tascilar, Koray; Babaoglu, Hakan; Bes, Cemal; Yurttas, Berna; Akar, Servet; Pehlivan, Ozlem; Akleylek, Cansu; Tecer, Duygu; Seyahi, Emire; Yuce-Inel, Tuba; Alpay-Kanitez, Nilufer; Bodakci, Erdal; Tekgoz, Emre; Colak, Seda; Bolek, Ertugrul Cagri; Koca, Suleyman Serdar; Kalyoncu, Umut; Icacan, Ozan Cemal; Ugurlu, Serdal; Oz, Hande Ece; Hamuryudan, Vedat; Hatemi, Gulen",Front Immunol,201,1

The impact of these lockdowns on mental health is inadequately understood. On the one hand such drastic changes in daily routines could be detrimental to mental health. On the other hand, it might not be experienced negatively, especially because the entire population was affected. METHODS: The aim of this study was to determine mental health outcomes during pandemic induced lockdowns and to examine known predictors of mental health outcomes. We therefore surveyed n = 9,565 people from 78 countries and 18 languages. Outcomes assessed were stress, depression, affect, and wellbeing. Predictors included country, sociodemographic factors, lockdown characteristics, social factors, and psychological factors. RESULTS: Results indicated that on average about 10% of the sample was languishing from low levels of mental health and about 50% had only moderate mental health. Importantly, three consistent predictors of mental health emerged: social support, education level, and psychologically flexible (vs. rigid) responding. Poorer outcomes were most strongly predicted by a worsening of finances and not having access to basic supplies. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that on whole, respondents were moderately mentally healthy at the time of a population-wide lockdown. The highest level of mental health difficulties were found in approximately 10% of the population. Findings suggest that public health initiatives should target people without social support and those whose finances worsen as a result of the lockdown. Interventions that promote psychological flexibility may mitigate the impact of the pandemic.","Gloster, Andrew T; Lamnisos, Demetris; Lubenko, Jelena; Presti, Giovambattista; Squatrito, Valeria; Constantinou, Marios; Nicolaou, Christiana; Papacostas, Savvas; Aydin, Gökçen; Chong, Yuen Yu; Chien, Wai Tong; Cheng, Ho Yu; Ruiz, Francisco J; Garcia-Martin, Maria B; Obando-Posada, Diana P; Segura-Vargas, Miguel A; Vasiliou, Vasilis S; McHugh, Louise; Höfer, Stefan; Baban, Adriana; Dias Neto, David; Nunes da Silva, Ana; Monestès, Jean-Louis; Alvarez-Galvez, Javier; Paez-Blarrina, Marisa; Montesinos, Francisco; Valdivia-Salas, Sonsoles; Ori, Dorottya; Kleszcz, Bartosz; Lappalainen, Raimo; Ivanovic, Iva; Gosar, David; Dionne, Frederick; Merwin, Rhonda M; Kassianos, Angelos P; Karekla, Maria",PLoS One,201,16

I first discuss the potential mechanisms between exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 and the opportunity to clearly formulate causal questions of interest through the target trial framework. Then, I discuss challenges regarding the use of quasiexperimental designs that capitalize on the differential timing of COVID-19 policies including the selection of control groups and potential violations of the common shock assumption.

However, the lack of dedicated policies and harmonized regulations has been perceived by stakeholders within the air transport community as the major contributor to shortfalls in global production over the past decade (&lt;0.01% of the total aviation fuel demand). This research combines qualitative and mixed methods to study stakeholder perceptions by identifying and analyzing collective narratives on AJF (what matters, why does it and who says so) influencing the policy process at the ICAO. Q-method allowed to identify four metanarratives across participants, three of which have a distinctive weak sustainability approach to international aviation’s growth and one that is typically representative of a strong sustainability approach. This method also revealed a common ground of beliefs and understandings among stakeholders that could facilitate the discussion, negotiation and consensus of some of the multidimensional nuances inherent to the metanarratives analyzed. By classifying stakeholders’ salience based on their possession of power, legitimacy and urgency as dynamic and relational attributes to the ICAO, the authors suggest options to bring valuable expertise from low-salient and non-stakeholders into the formulation of policies on AJF through a variety of collaborative arrangements with medium and highly salient stakeholders. The role of AJF is further explored within the context of the COVID-19 outbreak, the flygskam movement in Europe, and the impending renewal of climate commitments under the Paris Agreement. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Soria Baledón, M.; Trudel, M.; Kosoy, N.",International Journal of Sustainable Transportation,201,20

The challenge is to encompass social/citizen values, health system goals, and financial realities and to incorporate them into the policy-making process. This is a challenge for all health systems and of particular importance for Latin American (LA) countries. Our objective was to understand how and under what conditions societal values inform decisions about health system financing in LA countries. METHODS: A critical interpretive synthesis approach was utilised for this work. We searched 17 databases in December 2016 to identify articles written in English, Spanish or Portuguese that focus on values that inform the policy process for health system financing in LA countries at the macro and meso levels. Two reviewers independently screened records and assessed them for inclusion. One researcher conceptually mapped the included articles, created structured summaries of key findings from each, and selected a purposive sample of articles to thematically synthesise the results across the domains of agenda-setting/prioritisation, policy development and implementation. RESULTS: We identified 5925 references, included 199 papers, and synthesised 68 papers. We identified 116 values and developed a framework to explain how values have been used to inform policy decisions about financing in LA countries. This framework has four categories - (1) goal-related values (i.e. guiding principles of the health system); (2) technical values (those incorporated into the instruments adopted by policy-makers to ensure a sustainable and efficient health system); (3) governance values (those applied in the policy process to ensure a transparent and accountable process of decision-making); and (4) situational values (a broad category of values that represent competing strategies to make decisions in the health systems, their influence varying according to the four factors). CONCLUSIONS: It is an effort to consolidate and explain how different social values are considered and how they support policy decision-making about health system financing. This can help policy-makers to explicitly incorporate values into the policy process and understand how values are supporting the achievement of policy goals in health system financing.

In this study, we present a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) nanosheet-modified dendrimer droplet microarray (DMA) for rapid and sensitive detection of retroviral nucleic acids of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and human immunodeficiency virus-2 (HIV-2) simultaneously. The DMA platform was fabricated by omniphobic-omniphilic patterning on a surface-grafted dendrimer substrate. Functionalized MoS2 nanosheets modified with fluorescent dye-labeled oligomer probes were prepatterned on positively charged amino-modified omniphilic spots to form a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensing microarray. With the formation of separated microdroplets of sample on the hydrophobic-hydrophilic micropattern, prepatterned oligomer probes specifically hybridized with the target HIV genes and detached from the MoS2 nanosheet surface due to weakening of the adsorption force, leading to fluorescence signal recovery. As a proof of concept, we used this microarray with a small sample size (<150 nL) for simultaneous detection of HIV-1 and HIV-2 nucleic acids with a limit of detection (LOD) of 50 pM. The multiplex detection capability was further demonstrated for simultaneous detection of five viral genes (HIV-1, HIV-2, ORFlab, and N genes of SARS-COV-2 and M gene of Influenza A). This work demonstrated the potential of this novel MoS2-DMA FRET sensing platform for high-throughput multiplexed viral nucleic acid screening.","Oudeng, Gerile; Benz, Maximilian; Popova, Anna A; Zhang, Yu; Yi, Changqing; Levkin, Pavel A; Yang, Mo",ACS appl. mater. interfaces (Online),201,10

The aim of this study was to elucidate the household transmission mode and to further estimate effective and basic reproductive number with and without non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). METHODS: A total of 26 households with 39 family clusters between January, 2020 and February, 2021 in Taiwan were enrolled for analysis. The Becker's chain binomial model was used to analyze the probabilities of being infected and escaping from SARS-COV-2 before and after January 1st, 2021, which were further converted to estimating basic reproductive numbers in the absence of NPIs. The likelihood of leading to the subsequent community-acquired outbreak given NPIs was further assessed. RESULTS: The secondary attack rate was 46.2%. Given the saturated Greenwood model selected as the best fitted model, the probability of being infected and escaping from COVID-19 within household was estimated as 44.4% (95% CI: 5.0%-53.7%) and 55.7% (95% CI: 46.3%-65.0%), respectively. In the second period of early 2021, the infected probability was increased to 58.3% (95% CI: 12.7%-90.0%) and the escape probability was lowered to 41.7% (95% CI: 0.0%-86.9%). The corresponding basic reproductive numbers (R0) increased from 4.29 in the first period to 6.73 in the second period without NPIs. However, none of subsequent community-acquired outbreak was noted in Taiwan given very effective NPIs in both periods. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method and results are useful for designing household-specific containment measures and NPIs to stamp out a large-scale community-acquired outbreak as demonstrated in Taiwan.","Hsu, Chen-Yang; Wang, Jann-Tay; Huang, Kuo-Chin; Fan, Antoria Chiao-Hsin; Yeh, Yen-Po; Chen, Sam Li-Sheng",J.

We hypothesize that patients had a delayed presentation of acute appendicitis during the COVID-19 pandemic, which affected severity of disease on presentation and outcomes. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of all patients who were treated for acute appendicitis at Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital (MSCH) between March 1, 2020 and May 31, 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic was at its peak in New York City (NYC). For comparison, we reviewed patients treated from March 1, 2019 to May 31, 2019, prior to the pandemic. Demographics and baseline patient characteristics were analyzed for potential confounding variables. Outcomes were collected and grouped into those quantifying severity of illness on presentation to our ED, type of treatment, and associated post-treatment outcomes. Fisher's Exact Test and Kruskal-Wallis Test were used for univariate analysis while cox regression with calculation of hazard ratios was used for multivariate analysis. RESULTS: A total of 89 patients were included in this study, 41 patients were treated for appendicitis from March 1 to May 31 of 2019 (non-pandemic) and 48 were treated during the same time period in 2020 (pandemic). Duration of symptoms prior to presentation to the ED was significantly longer in patients treated in 2020, with a median of 2â¯days compared to 1â¯day (pâ¯=â¯0.003). Additionally, these patients were more likely to present with reported fever (52.1% vs 24.4%, pâ¯=â¯0.009) and had a higher heart rate on presentation with a median of 101 beats per minute (bpm) compared to 91â¯bpm (pâ¯=â¯0.040). Findings of complicated appendicitis on radiographic imaging including suspicion of perforation (41.7% vs 9.8%, pâ¯<â¯0.001) and intra-abdominal abscess (27.1% vs 7.3%, pâ¯=â¯0.025) were higher in patients presenting in 2020. Patients treated during the pandemic had higher rates of non-operative treatment (25.0% vs 7.3%, pâ¯=â¯0.044) requiring increased antibiotic use and image-guided percutaneous drain placement. They also had longer hospital length of stay by a median of 1â¯day (pâ¯=â¯0.001) and longer duration until symptom resolution by a median of 1â¯day (pâ¯=â¯0.004). Type of treatment was not a predictor of LOS (HRâ¯=â¯0.565, 95% CIâ¯=â¯0.357-0.894, pâ¯=â¯0.015) or duration until symptom resolution (HRâ¯=â¯0.630, 95% CIâ¯=â¯0.405-0.979, pâ¯=â¯0.040).

The speed and extentof its spread havedemonstrated a global failure to cultivate awareness and cooperation in responseto the threat. Therefore, in order to improve public awareness and the management of public health threats, we propose a strategy to initiate global civil society. Using Walt and Gilson's policy triangle framework for policy analysis, we reviewed and analysed a series of articles and policies related to COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), health resilience in the context of globalization, as well as other countries’ experiences. We also explored constitutional obligations, public health legislation, collaboration of civil society, and policies related to public health, as well as their implementation. Every country has its own public policy strategy for handling COVID-19. One possible solution is to expand the GHSA commitments and bind all countries that have signed the agreement to a single public policy strategy for the handling of COVID-19. The poor handling of the COVID-19 outbreak has demonstrated the need for Indonesia’s civil society collaborativelyoversee the Indonesia’s government’s implementationof its constitutional obligations.

METHODS: The clinical data of 7 COVID-19 patients complicated with pneumothorax admitted to Huanggang Central Hospital from January 3 to March 10, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. The clinical features, diagnosis and treatment were summarized, and experience in the treatment of COVID-19 was shared. RESULTS: (1) General information: among the 7 patients, 5 were males and 2 were females. Four of them had no underlying disease, and 1 had a history of diabetes and hypertension. One patient had only a history of hypertension. There were 6 cases of right pneumothorax and 1 case of bilateral pneumothorax. The 7 patients had a long hospital stay, all over 4 weeks, mostly complicated with multiple organ dysfunction. (2) Imaging examination: 1 case evolved from the early stage to the advanced stage within 1 week and to the severe stage within 2 weeks. Pneumothorax occurred 4 weeks later, and was absorbed within 2 weeks. The remaining 6 patients presented progressive stage on admission, all of them advanced to severe stage within 1 to 2 weeks, and most of them presented diffused consolidation shadows, striation shadows and fibrosis of both lungs, obvious pleural adhesion, and extremely slow lesion absorption. (3) Treatment: 1 severe patient with pneumothorax 4 weeks after onset was given non-invasive mechanical ventilation. The remaining 6 critically ill patients were treated with endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Five patients were treated with mechanical ventilation within 3 days after the occurrence of pneumothorax, and 1 patient was treated with mechanical ventilation after 11 days. (4) Outcome: 1 patient without endotracheal intubation was continuously given nasal high-flow oxygen therapy, and the condition was stable. Four of the 6 patients complicated with pneumothorax after endotracheal intubation died, and the other 2 patients successfully removed the drainage tube within 2 weeks of closed thoracic drainage, and their condition gradually stabilized. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 complicated with pneumothorax is a dangerous disease with poor prognosis, and should be paid adequate attention.","Jia, Liping; Wang, Changfeng; Zhang, Yujiao; Ye, Yuanyuan; Jin, Zhaoxia",Zhonghua Wei Zhong Bing Ji Jiu Yi Xue,201,1

Military physicians are uniquely trained to excel in such large-scale emergency situations. Civilian physicians can harness military know-how, but it will require research into military healthcare responses-specifically, we need to learn lessons from military interprofessional healthcare teams (MIHTs). METHODS: This research answers two questions: What are the characteristics of successful MIHTs? Why are those characteristics important to MIHT success in large-scale emergency situations? Using a Grounded Theory approach, 30 interviews were conducted soliciting perspectives from the broadest range of healthcare professionals who had experiences working in and leading MIHTs. Purposive sampling was used to recruit participants broadly across: contexts where MIHTs work; military branches; ranks; genders; and healthcare professions. Data were iteratively collected and analyzed. RESULTS: 30 participants were interviewed (18 male (60%); 21 officers (70%); 9 enlisted (30%)) who held various healthcare occupations (medic/tech/corpsman (9); nurse (7); physician (7); dentist (2); occupational therapist (2); chaplain (1); physician's assistant (1); and psychiatrist (1)). Six characteristics of successful MIHTs that are directly applicable to large-scale emergency situations were identified thatthat clustered into two themes: own your purposes and responsibilities (through mission focus and ethical bearing) and get it done, safely (via situational awareness, adaptability, and leadership with followership).

It is having devastating effects on the people of all countries. In this regard, the phytochemicals of medicinal plants could be explored to prevent this disease. M. oleifera is a miracle plant with antibacterial, antiviral, and antioxidant properties because of its high content of flavonoids, glucosides and glucosinolates. Therefore, we constructed a library of 294 phytochemicals of M. oleifera and filtered it through the FAF-Drugs4. Further, molecular docking studies of filtered phytochemicals were performed with Mpro enzyme to investigate the binding interactions. Drug likeness properties, ADMET prediction were analyzed to determine the therapeutic aspect of these compounds. Based on the binding energy score of the top 4 compounds, the results indicate that Vicenin-2 has the highest binding affinity (-8.6 kcal mol-1) as compared to the reference molecule (-8.4 kcal mol-1). ADMET result reveals that all top four compounds have minimal toxic effects and good absorption. Further, 500 ns molecular dynamics simulation of the top four compounds showed that Kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside and Vitexin have good stability with Mpro. These two compounds were then subjected for MMPBSA (last 50 ns) calculation to analyze the protein-ligand stability and dynamic behavior. Kaempferol-3-O-rutinoside and Vitexin showed very good binding free energy i.e. -40.136 kJ mol-1 and -26.784 kJ mol-1, respectively.

METHODS: This retrospective cohort study compared stroke patients admitted to a comprehensive stroke center during the COVID-19 pandemic April 1 2020 to June 30 2020 (COVID-19) to patients admitted April 1 2019 to June 30 2019. We examined stroke admission volume and acute stroke treatment use. RESULTS: There were 637 stroke admissions, 52% in 2019 and 48% during COVID-19, with similar median admissions per day (4 vs 3, P=0.21). The proportion of admissions by stroke type was comparable (ischemic, P=0.69; hemorrhagic, P=0.39; transient ischemic stroke, P=0.10). Acute stroke treatment was similar in 2019 to COVID-19: tPA prior to arrival (18% vs, 18%, P=0.89), tPA treatment on arrival (6% vs 7%, P=0.85), and endovascular therapy (endovascular therapy (ET), 22% vs 25%, P=0.54). The door to needle time was also similar, P=0.12, however, the median time from arrival to groin puncture was significantly longer during COVID-19 (38 vs 43 min, P=0.002). A significantly higher proportion of patients receiving ET were intubated during COVID-19 due to SNIS guideline implementation (45% vs 96%, P<0.0001). There were no differences by study period in discharge mRS, P=0.84 or TICI score, P=0.26. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic did not significantly affect stroke admission volume or acute stroke treatment utilization. Outcomes were not affected by implementing SNIS guidelines. Although there was a statistical increase in time to groin puncture for ET, it was not clinically meaningful. These results suggest hospitals managing patients efficiently can implement practices in response to COVID-19 without impacting outcomes.","Atchie, Benjamin; Jarvis, Stephanie; Stoddard, Erica; Salottolo, Kristin; Nieberlein, Amy; McCarthy, Kathryn; Bartt, Russell; Bennett, Alicia; Burrell, Christian; Frei, Donald; Bar-Or, David",J. neurointerv. surg.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the etiological agent of COVID-19, has been found closely related to the bat coronavirus strain RaTG13 (Bat-CoV RaTG13) and a recently identified pangolin coronavirus (Pangolin-CoV-2020). Here, we first investigated the ability of SARS-CoV-2 and three related coronaviruses to utilize animal orthologs of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry. We found that ACE2 orthologs of a wide range of domestic and wild mammals, including camels, cattle, horses, goats, sheep, cats, rabbits, and pangolins, were able to support cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that these species might be able to harbor and spread this virus. In addition, the pangolin and bat coronaviruses, Pangolin-CoV-2020 and Bat-CoV RaTG13, were also found able to utilize human ACE2 and a number of animal-ACE2 orthologs for cell entry, indicating risks of spillover of these viruses into humans in the future. We then developed potently anticoronavirus ACE2-Ig proteins that are broadly effective against the four distinct coronaviruses. In particular, through truncating ACE2 at its residue 740 but not 615, introducing a D30E mutation, and adopting an antibody-like tetrameric-ACE2 configuration, we generated an ACE2-Ig variant that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 at picomolar range. These data demonstrate that the improved ACE2-Ig variants developed in this study could potentially be developed to protect from SARS-CoV-2 and some other SARS-like viruses that might spillover into humans in the future.IMPORTANCE The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the etiological agent of the currently uncontrolled coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. It is important to study the host range of SARS-CoV-2, because some domestic species might harbor the virus and transmit it back to humans. In addition, insight into the ability of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-like viruses to utilize animal orthologs of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 might provide structural insight into improving ACE2-based viral entry inhibitors. In this study, we found that ACE2 orthologs of a wide range of domestic and wild animals can support cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 and three related coronaviruses, providing insights into identifying animal hosts of these viruses. We also developed recombinant ACE2-Ig proteins that are able to potently block these viral infections, providing a promising approach to developing antiviral proteins broadly effective against these distinct coronaviruses.","Li, Yujun; Wang, Haimin; Tang, Xiaojuan; Fang, Shisong; Ma, Danting; Du, Chengzhi; Wang, Yifei; Pan, Hong; Yao, Weitong; Zhang, Renli; Zou, Xuan; Zheng, Jie; Xu, Liangde; Farzan, Michael; Zhong, Guocai",J. virol,201,1

It is the product of the interaction between consumer health needs and supply-side reform. However, there has still been no systematic summary of its establishment and definition, nor has there been an analysis of its service content. OBJECTIVE: The primary purpose of this study was to understand the definition, establishment, and development status of internet hospitals. METHODS: Data on internet hospitals were obtained via the Baidu search engine for results up until January 1, 2019. Based on the results of the search, we obtained more detailed information from the official websites and apps of 130 online hospitals and formed a database for descriptive analysis. RESULTS: By January 2019, the number of registered internet hospitals had expanded to approximately 130 in 25 provinces, accounting for 73.5% of all provinces or province-level municipalities in China. Internet hospitals, as a new telehealth model, are distinct but overlap with online health, telemedicine, and mobile medical. They offer four kinds of services-convenience services, online medical services, telemedicine, and related industries. In general, there is an underlying common treatment flowchart of care in ordinary and internet hospitals. There are three different sponsors-government-led integration, hospital-led, and enterprise-led internet hospitals-for which stakeholders have different supporting content and responsibilities. CONCLUSIONS: Internet hospitals are booming in China, and it is the joint effort of the government and the market to alleviate the coexistence of shortages of medical resources and wasted medical supplies.

500459,500459,500459,Equity and evidence during vaccine rollout: stepped wedge cluster randomised trials could help,19.996166,8.403083,2021,"BACKGROUND: Communicating scientific uncertainty about public health threats such as COVID-19 is an ethically desirable task endorsed by expert guidelines on crisis communication. However, the communication of scientific uncertainty is challenging because of its potential to promote ambiguity aversion-a well-described syndrome of negative psychological responses consisting of heightened risk perceptions, emotional distress, and decision avoidance. Communication strategies that can inform the public about scientific uncertainty while mitigating ambiguity aversion are a critical unmet need. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate whether an ""uncertainty-normalizing"" communication strategy-aimed at reinforcing the expected nature of scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic-can reduce ambiguity aversion, and to compare its effectiveness to conventional public communication strategies aimed at promoting hope and prosocial values. METHODS: In an online factorial experiment conducted from May to June 2020, a national sample of 1497 US adults read one of five versions of an informational message describing the nature, transmission, prevention, and treatment of COVID-19; the versions varied in level of expressed scientific uncertainty and supplemental focus (ie, uncertainty-normalizing, hope-promoting, and prosocial). Participants then completed measures of cognitive, emotional, and behavioral manifestations of ambiguity aversion (ie, perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19, COVID-19 worry, and intentions for COVID-19 risk-reducing behaviors and vaccination). Analyses assessed (1) the extent to which communicating uncertainty produced ambiguity-averse psychological responses; (2) the comparative effectiveness of uncertainty-normalizing, hope-promoting, and prosocial communication strategies in reducing ambiguity-averse responses; and (3) potential moderators of the effects of alternative uncertainty communication strategies. RESULTS: The communication of scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic increased perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19 and worry about COVID-19, consistent with ambiguity aversion. However, it did not affect intentions for risk-reducing behaviors or vaccination. The uncertainty-normalizing strategy reduced these aversive effects of communicating scientific uncertainty, resulting in levels of both perceived likelihood of getting COVID-19 and worry about COVID-19 that did not differ from the control message that did not communicate uncertainty. In contrast, the hope-promoting and prosocial strategies did not decrease ambiguity-averse responses to scientific uncertainty. Age and political affiliation, respectively, moderated the effects of uncertainty communication strategies on intentions for COVID-19 risk-reducing behaviors and worry about COVID-19. CONCLUSIONS: Communicating scientific uncertainty about the COVID-19 pandemic produces ambiguity-averse cognitive and emotional, but not behavioral, responses among the general public, and an uncertainty-normalizing communication strategy reduces these responses. Normalizing uncertainty may be an effective strategy for mitigating ambiguity aversion in crisis communication efforts. More research is needed to test uncertainty-normalizing communication strategies and to elucidate the factors that moderate their effectiveness.","Han, Paul K J; Scharnetzki, Elizabeth; Scherer, Aaron M; Thorpe, Alistair; Lary, Christine; Waterston, Leo B; Fagerlin, Angela; Dieckmann, Nathan F",J Med Internet Res,201,29

Households in particular represent a close-contact environment with high probability of transmission between persons of different ages and with different roles in society. METHODS: Complete households with a laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive case in the Netherlands (March-May 2020) were included. At least three home visits were performed during 4-6 week of follow-up, collecting naso- and oropharyngeal swabs, oral fluid, feces and blood samples for molecular and serological analyses of all household members. Symptoms were recorded from two weeks before the first visit through to the final visit. Infection secondary attack rates (SAR) were estimated with logistic regression. A transmission model was used to assess transmission routes in the household. RESULTS: A total of 55 households with 187 household contacts were included. In 17 households no transmission took place, and in 11 households all persons were infected. Estimated infection SARs were high, ranging from 35% (95%CI: 24%-46%) in children to 51% (95%CI: 39%-63%) in adults. Estimated transmission rates in the household were high, with reduced susceptibility of children compared to adolescents and adults (0.67; 95%CI: 0.40-1.1). CONCLUSION: Estimated infection SARs were higher than reported in earlier household studies, presumably owing to our dense sampling protocol. Children were shown to be less susceptible than adults, but the estimated infection SAR in children was still high. Our results reinforce the role of households as one of the main multipliers of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the population.","Reukers, Daphne F M; van Boven, Michiel; Meijer, Adam; Rots, Nynke; Reusken, Chantal; Roof, Inge; van Gageldonk-Lafeber, Arianne B; van der Hoek, Wim; van den Hof, Susan",Clin. infect. dis,201,16

With the sudden surge in demand for personal protective equipment (PPE), significant concerns regarding the ongoing availability emerged. One solution proposed is re-sterilisation of respirator masks and this has been commenced in some parts of the world. On review of the literature, very little is documented regarding the knowledge of masks and the attitudes of healthcare workers towards using re-sterilised masks. METHODS: A comprehensive questionnaire was used to assess general knowledge and attitudes around facemasks and respirators. RESULTS: There were 190 respondents. There were significant gaps in knowledge and understanding of when particular face masks should be worn. One-third had significant concerns about ongoing availability. One-third had concerns about the quality of the masks as the pandemic continued. Only 10% of respondents underwent formal face-fitting. Eighty percent of respondents stated they would wear a re-sterilised mask. A further 15% would use a re-sterilised mask but required certain reassurances. Five percent of our respondents would not use a re-sterilised mask under any circumstances. DISCUSSION: Ensuring an adequate understanding of face masks is crucial among healthcare workers (HCWs) and this study highlights a need for further education. It also demonstrates a general acceptability among HCWs towards the use of re-sterilised face masks.","O039,; Byrne, Ciara; Kenny, Fred; Eustace, Sarah; Gibbons, John P",Ir. j. med. sci,201,16

Methods: TCMSP, ETCM and YATCM databases were used to search the chemical constituents of Qingfei Dayuan Granules, and the threshold values of OB ≥ 30% and DL ≥0.18 were used to screen the potential active compounds. SIB and STITCH databases were used to query the targets corresponding to the active compounds, and the PPI network and network topology parameters were obtained by using STRING database. Cytoscape 3.6.0 was used to screen the hub targets. The key targets were analyzed by Gene Ontology (GO), the Kyoto Encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment and tissue enrichment using DAVID 6.8 software. The molecular docking was performed by AutoDock Tools 1.5.6 software. Results: A total of 251 active compounds and 1 037 targets were obtained, 107 key targets and 185 corresponding compounds were screened. The key targets involved ESR1, AR, EGFR, KDR, MMP2, and 52 genes were coexpressed with ACE2. The results of GO function enrichment analysis showed that Qingfei Dayuan Granules mainly regulated the biological processes of cell surface signaling transduction, molecular function, phosphorylation and transcription. KEGG pathway enrichment mainly involved chemokine signaling pathway, T cell receptor signaling pathway, B cell receptor signaling pathway, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity and Toll like receptor signaling pathway. The results of tissue enrichment showed that the key gene expression sites were mainly in lung and epithelial cells, involving a variety of immune cells, such as T cells, B cells, lymphocytes, etc. Molecular docking showed that the compounds with good binding power to SARS-CoV-2-RBD-ACE2 complex in Qingfei Dayuan granules were mainly come from Bupleuri Radix, Codonopsis Radix, Anemarrhenae Rhizoma, and Glycyrrhizae Radix et Rhizoma. Saikosaponin, glycyrrhizic acid, anemarsaponin had good binding power with SARS-CoV-2-S-RBD-ACE2, which may be potential active components against SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: Qingfei Dayuan Granules has the characteristics of multi-components, multi-targets and multi-pathway regulation. Saikosaponin, glycyrrhizic acid, and anemarsaponin may be the potential active components against SARS-CoV-2. The mechanisms of its treatment against COVID-19 may be related to the regulation of the co-expressed genes with ACE2, inhibition of inflammation and immune related signaling pathways, and the destruction of the complex structure of SARS-CoV-2-S-RBD-ACE2.","Zhou, Shan-Shan; Li, Wei-Nan; Ai, Zhong-Zhu; Wang, Lin-Qun; Ba, Yuan-Ming",Chin.

However, few have focused on the specific needs of Asian Americans (AA). We examine the prevalence of HRSN during a period spanning the COVID-19 pandemic to inform strategies to improve cancer screening and primary care among AA patients. Methods: We implemented a self-administered HRSN screening tool in English and Chinese, traditional (T) or simplified (S) text, within a hospital-affiliated, outpatient primary care practice predominantly serving AA in New Jersey. HRSN items included food insecurity, transportation barriers, utility needs, interpersonal violence, housing instability, immigration history, and neighborhood perceptions on cohesion and trust. We conducted medical chart reviews for a subset of participants to explore the relationship between HRSN and history of cancer screening. Results: Among 236 participants, most were Asian (74%), non-US born (79%), and privately insured (57%). One-third responded in Chinese (37%). Half reported having &#8805;1 HRSN. Interpersonal violence was high across all participants. Transportation needs were highest among Chinese-T participants, while food insecurity and housing instability were higher among Chinese-S participants. Lower-income patients had higher odds of having &#8805;2 HRSN (OR:2.53, 95% CI: 1.12, 5.98). Older age and public insurance/uninsured were significantly associated with low neighborhood perceptions. Conclusions: We observed higher than anticipated reports of HRSN among primary care patients in a suburban, hospital-affiliated practice serving AA. Low neighborhood perceptions, particularly among Chinese-S participants, highlight the importance of addressing broader SDOH among insured, suburban AA patients. These study findings inform the need to augment HRSN identification to adequately address social needs that impact health outcomes and life course experiences for Asian patients. As HRSN measuring efforts continue, and COVID-19's impact on the health of minority communities emerge, it will be critical to develop community-specific referral pathways to connect AA to resources for HRSN and continue to address more upstream social determinants of health for those who are disproportionately impacted.","Tsui, Jennifer; Yang, Annie; Anuforo, Bianca; Chou, Jolene; Brogden, Ruth; Xu, Binghong; Cantor, Joel C; Wang, Su",Front Public Health,201,19

The way in which policy makers respond to the current pandemic could have large effects on how the world looks after the pandemic subsides. We aim to investigate complex questions post COVID-19 around the relationships and intersections concerning nationalism, religiosity, and anti-immigrant sentiment from a socio-cognitive perspective by applying a mixed-method approach (survey and modelling); in a context where unprecedented contagion threats have caused huge instability. There are still significant gaps in the scholarly literature on populism and nationalism. In particular, there is a lack of attention to the role of evolved human psychology in responding to persistent threats, which can fall into four broad categories in the literature: predation (threats to one's life via being eaten or killed in some other way), contagion (threats to one's life via physical infection), natural (threats to one's life via natural disasters), and social (threats to one's life by destroying social standing). These threats have been discussed in light of their effects on religion and other forms of behaviour, but they have not been employed to study nationalist and populist behaviours. In what follows, two studies are presented that begin to fill this gap in the literature. The first is a survey used to inform our theoretical framework and explore the different possible relationships in an online sample. The second is a study of a computer simulation. Both studies (completed in 2020) found very clear effects among the relevant variables, enabling us to identify trends that require further explanation and research as we move toward models that can adequately inform policy discussions.","Bullock, Josh; Lane, Justin E.; Miklouvsi'c, Igor; Shults, LeRon",,201,15

In this setting the sensitivity and specificity of the best performing assays can both exceed 98%. However, antibody assay performance following mild infection is less clear. METHODS: We assessed quantitative IgG responses in a cohort of healthcare workers in Oxford, UK, with a high pre-test probability of Covid-19, in particular the 991/11,475(8.6%) who reported loss of smell/taste. We use anosmia/ageusia and other risk factors as probes for Covid-19 infection potentially undiagnosed by immunoassays by investigating their relationship with antibody readings either side of assay thresholds. RESULTS: The proportion of healthcare workers reporting anosmia/ageusia increased at antibody readings below diagnostic thresholds using an in-house ELISA (n = 9324) and the Abbott Architect chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA; n = 11,324): 426/906 (47%) reported anosmia/ageusia with a positive ELISA, 59/449 (13.1%) with high-negative and 326/7969 (4.1%) with low-negative readings. Similarly, by CMIA, 518/1093 (47.4%) with a positive result reported anosmia/ageusia, 106/686 (15.5%) with a high-negative and 358/9563 (3.7%) with a low-negative result. Adjusting for the proportion of staff reporting anosmia/ageusia suggests the sensitivity of both assays in mild infection is lower than previously reported: Oxford ELISA 89.8% (95%CI 86.6-92.8%) and Abbott CMIA 79.3% (75.9-82.7%). CONCLUSION: Following mild SARS-CoV-2 infection 10-30% of individuals may have negative immunoassay results. While lowered diagnostic thresholds may result in unacceptable specificity, our findings have implications for epidemiological analyses and result interpretation in individuals with a high pre-test probability. Samples from mild PCR-confirmed infections should be included in SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay evaluations.","Eyre, David W; Lumley, Sheila F; O039,; Donnell, Denise; Stoesser, Nicole E; Matthews, Philippa C; Howarth, Alison; Hatch, Stephanie B; Marsden, Brian D; Cox, Stuart; James, Tim; Cornall, Richard J; Stuart, David I; Screaton, Gavin; Ebner, Daniel; Crook, Derrick W; Conlon, Christopher P; Jeffery, Katie; Walker, Timothy M; Peto, Timothy E A",BMC Infect Dis,201,24

Arbitrary laws and counterproductive policies previously subject to only incremental reform have given way to sweeping changes: people convicted of nonviolent drug crimes have been released from jails and prisons, the enforcement of drug laws has been cast aside as a priority, and the regulations surrounding addiction treatment medications and treating patients with OUD have been greatly loosened. These are changes many practitioners and advocates have sought for years if not decades, but they come with the reality that the old systems are culturally entrenched and likely to be resilient. It is critical that researchers evaluate these changes and synthesize the results with existing evidence in ways that empower efforts to make the most effective responses permanent.

519072,519072,519072,Coronavirus and diabetes: an update,20.083279,8.381791,2020,"BACKGROUND: Worldwide, COVID-19 has exacerbated the vulnerability of migrants, impacting many facets of their lives. Nepalese make up one of the largest groups of migrants residing in Japan. Crises, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could disproportionately affect migrants from low- and middle-income countries like Nepal, widening health and economic inequalities. An in-depth, comprehensive assessment is needed to appraise the diverse problems they encounter. Drawing upon qualitative interviews, this study aimed to identify challenges faced by Nepalese migrants in Japan as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and to discuss their needs to counter these challenges. METHODS: This qualitative study employed an interpretivist approach to appraise the first-hand experience of Nepalese migrants living in Japan. Fourteen participants (8 males and 6 females, aged 21 to 47 years old) were recruited to participate in semi-structured in-depth telephone interviews (45-60 min) regarding: (a) their perceived current physical and mental health, (b) problems faced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and (c) perception of available and necessary support structures. Purposive and snowball sampling techniques were used to recruit the participants. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and thematically analyzed. RESULTS: Six themes were identified: 1) experiencing psychosomatic symptoms, 2) adoption of new healthy behaviors, 3) financial hardship, 4) family concerns, 5) reflections on discrimination and 6) reflections of existing support and expectations of support systems. The findings of our study illustrate the specific impact of COVID-19 among Nepalese migrants regarding their unstable employment conditions, perceived lack of social support, possible obligation to send money home, difficulty in accessing services due to the language barrier, and a lack of effective governmental support from Nepal. Pandemic-related adversity has negatively impacted migrants' mental well-being, exacerbating their vulnerability. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive and timely support should be provided to the vulnerable migrant population. Effective coordination among relevant parties in both countries, including the governments concerned, should be facilitated.","Bhandari, Divya; Kotera, Yasuhiro; Ozaki, Akihiko; Abeysinghe, Sudeepa; Kosaka, Makoto; Tanimoto, Tetsuya",BMC Public Health,201,1

The more common causes of morbidity and death in these patients include pneumonia and respiratory failure, which cause the patients to require artificial ventilation and other techniques that can improve respiratory function. One of these techniques is chest physiotherapy, and this has been shown to improve gas exchange, reverse pathological progression, and reduce or avoid the need for artificial ventilation when it is provided very early in other respiratory conditions. For patients with COVID-19, there is limited evidence on its effect, especially in the acute stage and in patients on ventilators. In contrast, in patients after discharge, chest physiotherapy in the form of respiratory muscle training, cough exercise, diaphragmatic training, stretching exercise, and home exercise have resulted in improved FEV1 (L), FVC (L), FEV1/FVC%, diffusing lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO%), endurance, and quality of life, and a reduction in anxiety and depression symptoms. However, there are still controversies on whether chest physiotherapy can disperse aerosols and accelerate the rate of spread of the infection, especially since COVID-19 is highly contagious. While some authors believe it is possible, others believe the aerosol generated by chest physiotherapy is not within respirable range. Therefore, measures such as the use of surgical masks, tele-rehabilitation, and self-management tools can be used to limit cross-infection.","Abdullahi, Auwal",Front Med (Lausanne),201,16

It is a well-identified risk factor for increased mortality due to heightened rates of heart disease, certain cancers, musculoskeletal disorders, and bacterial, protozoan and viral infections. The increasing prevalence of obesity is of concern, as conventional pathogenesis may indeed be increased in obese hosts rather than healthy hosts, especially during this COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is a new disease and we do not have the luxury of cumulative data. Obesity activates the development of gene induced hypoxia and adipogenesis in obese animals. Several factors can influence obesity, for example, stress can increase the body weight by allowing people to consume high amounts of food with a higher propensity to consume palatable food. Obesity is a risk factor for the development of immune-mediated and some inflammatory-mediated diseases, including atherosclerosis and psoriasis, leading to a dampened immune response to infectious agents, leading to weaker post-infection impacts. Moreover, the obese host creates a special microenvironment for disease pathogenesis, marked by persistent low-grade inflammation. Therefore, it is advisable to sustain healthy eating habits by increasing the consumption of various plant-based and low-fat foods to protect our bodies and decrease the risk of infectious diseases, especially COVID-19.","Magdy Beshbishy, Amany; Hetta, Helal F.; Hussein, Diaa E.; Saati, Abdullah A.; C.

Based on the reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) framework, this study presents an examination of individual differences in some relevant psychological factors. DESIGN: Cross‐sectional psychometric. METHODS: UK respondents (N = 202) completed a personality questionnaire (RST‐PQ), measures of illness attitudes, concerns about the impact of coronavirus on health services and socio‐economic infrastructures, personal safety, and likelihood of voluntary self‐isolation. RESULTS: Respondents most concerned were older, had negative illness attitudes, and scored higher on reward reactivity (RR), indicating the motivation to take positive approach action despite prevailing worry/anxiety. Personal safety concerns were highest in those with negative illness attitudes and higher fight–flight–freeze system (FFFS, reflecting fear/avoidance) scores. Results suggest people are experiencing psychological conflict: between the urge to stay safe (FFFF‐related) and the desire to maintain a normal, pleasurable (RR‐related) life. Ways of ameliorating conflict may include maladaptive behaviours (panic buying), reflecting reward‐related displacement activity. Intended self‐isolation related to FFFS, but also low behavioural inhibition system (related to anxiety) scores. Older people reported themselves less likely to self‐isolate. CONCLUSIONS: Interventions need to consider individual differences in psychological factors in behaviour change, and we discuss relevant literature to inform policy makers and communicators. STATEMENT OF CONTRIBUTION: What is already known on this subject? Reinforcement sensitivity theory (RST) personality systems can influence perception of persuasive health messages. However, there is limited evidence for their direct effects on health concerns and behaviours, and none relating to specific infectious diseases. What does this study add? Reward reactivity (RR) is associated with concern about impact of coronavirus on the NHS and other social infrastructures, indicating the motivation to take positive‐approach action despite worry/anxiety. Personal safety concerns are related to fight–flight–freeze system traits (FFFS, reflecting fear/avoidance). Intended self‐isolation related to FFFS, but also low behavioural inhibition system (related to anxiety) scores. Older people reported themselves less likely to self‐isolate.

Online lectures have been practiced in different academic institutions around the world. The objective was to know the perception towards online lectures by the undergraduate students of a medical college. METHODS: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among the undergraduate students of dentistry, medicine, and nursing at Kathmandu Medical College via self-administered online questionnaire. Data were collected from November to December 2020 after ethical clearance from institutional review committee (Ref. no. 0311202002). Students who had not attended even one hour of online learning per week were excluded. Responses were collected using Google Forms which were analysed in Microsoft Excel. Descriptive statistics are presented as means, standard deviations, frequencies, and percentages. RESULTS: Out of 318 valid questionnaires, 143 (44.97%) students agreed that online lectures were effective but 138 (43.4%) disagreed that online lectures were more useful than traditional lectures. One hundred and forty five (45.60%) found online classes difficult to concentrate and 175 (55.03%) agreed that they preferred a combination of traditional teaching and online tutorials. Only two (0.63%) students strongly agreed on excellent internet during classes and 104 (32.70%) agreed it caused economic burden. Mean age of participants was 20.75±1.538 years; 202 (63.52%) were females; online learning per week was 18.75±9.157 hours; and duration of online learning was 20.28±9.997 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the students had a positive attitude towards e-learning when compared to similar studies.

Objective: To evaluate the association between comorbidities and the risk of death in patients with COVID-19, and to further explore potential sex-specific differences. Methods: We analyzed the data from 18,465 laboratory-confirmed cases that completed an epidemiological investigation in Hubei Province as of February 27, 2020. Information on death was obtained from the Infectious Disease Information System. The Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the association between comorbidities and the risk of death in patients with COVID-19. Results: The median age for COVID-19 patients was 50.5 years. 8828(47.81%) patients were females. Severe cases accounted for 20.11% of the study population. As of March 7, 2020, a total of 919 cases deceased from COVID-19 for a fatality rate of 4.98%. Hypertension (13.87%), diabetes (5.53%), and cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases CBVDs (4.45%) were the most prevalent comorbidities, and 27.37% of patients with COVID-19 reported having at least one comorbidity. After adjustment for age, gender, address, and clinical severity, patients with hypertension (HR 1.55, 95%CI 1.35-1.78), diabetes (HR 1.35, 95%CI 1.13-1.62), CBVDs (HR 1.70, 95%CI 1.43-2.02), chronic kidney diseases (HR 2.09, 95%CI 1.47-2.98), and at least two comorbidities (HR 1.84, 95%CI 1.55-2.18) had significant increased risks of death. And the association between diabetes and the risk of death from COVID-19 was prominent in women (HR 1.69, 95%CI 1.27-2.25) than in men (HR 1.16, 95%CI 0.91-1.46) (P for interaction = 0.036). Conclusion: Among laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Hubei province, China, patients with hypertension, diabetes, CBVDs, chronic kidney diseases were significantly associated with increased risk of death. The association between diabetes and the risk of death tended to be stronger in women than in men.

Gaining knowledge about its attributes and interactions with human host cells is crucial. Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are involved in the host cells’ innate antiviral immune response. In RNA interference, microRNAs (miRNAs) may bind to complementary sequences of the viral RNA strand, forming an miRNA-induced silencing complex, which destroys the viral RNA, thereby inhibiting viral protein expression. There are several targets for human miRNAs on SARS-CoV-2’s RNA, most of which are in the 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions. Mutations of the viral genome causing the creation or loss of miRNA binding sites may have crucial effects on SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity. In addition to mediating immunity, the ncRNA landscape of host cells further influences their susceptibility to virus infection, as certain miRNAs are essential in the regulation of cellular receptors that are necessary for virus invasion. Conversely, virus infection also changes the host ncRNA expression patterns, possibly augmenting conditions for viral replication and dissemination. Hence, ncRNAs typically upregulated in SARS-CoV-2 infection could be useful biomarkers for disease progression and severity. Understanding these mechanisms could provide further insight into the pathogenesis and possible treatment options against COVID-19.","Henzinger, Hanna; Barth, Dominik A.; Klec, Christiane; Pichler, Martin",Viruses,201,6

We previously showed that the IFITM3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with susceptibility to ulcerative colitis (UC). The present study aimed to investigate whether the polymorphisms in the IFITM1 gene are associated with susceptibility to UC. We also evaluated the expression levels in the putative functional promoter polymorphisms to determine the change of their activity. Gene expression profiles in the tissues obtained from human digestive tracts by RT-PCR, and the possible variation sites and SNPs of IFITM1 were identified by direct sequencing method. Genotype analysis in the IFITM1 SNPs was performed by high resolution melting and TaqMan probe analysis, and the haplotype frequencies of IFITM1 SNPs for multiple loci were estimated using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm. The expression levels in the putative functional promoter polymorphisms were evaluated by performing a luciferase reporter assay. We identified two SNPs and two variation sites, g.-1920G>A (rs77537847), g.-1547delA (novel) and g.-416C>G (rs11246062) in the promoter region, and g.364delA (rs200576757) in intron 1. The genotype and allele frequencies of the g.-1920G>A polymorphism of IFITM1 gene in the UC patients were significantly different from those of the healthy controls (P = 0.002 and 0.042, respectively). These results suggest that the g.-1920G>A polymorphism in IFITM1 may be associated with susceptibility to UC.","Mo, Ji-Su; Na, Kyung-Sook; Yu, Ji-In; Chae, Soo-Cheon",Immunol Lett,201,1

We report the largest case series to date of cerebrovascular complications of COVID-19 and compare with stroke patients without infection. METHODS: Retrospective case series of COVID-19 patients with imaging-confirmed stroke, treated at 11 hospitals in New York, between March 14 and April 26, 2020. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging, and outcome data were collected, and cases were compared with date-matched controls without COVID-19 from 1 year prior. RESULTS: Eighty-six COVID-19–positive stroke cases were identified (mean age, 67.4 years; 44.2% women). Ischemic stroke (83.7%) and nonfocal neurological presentations (67.4%) predominated, commonly involving multivascular distributions (45.8%) with associated hemorrhage (20.8%). Compared with controls (n=499), COVID-19 was associated with in-hospital stroke onset (47.7% versus 5.0%; P<0.001), mortality (29.1% versus 9.0%; P<0.001), and Black/multiracial race (58.1% versus 36.9%; P=0.001). COVID-19 was the strongest independent risk factor for in-hospital stroke (odds ratio, 20.9 [95% CI, 10.4–42.2]; P<0.001), whereas COVID-19, older age, and intracranial hemorrhage independently predicted mortality. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is an independent risk factor for stroke in hospitalized patients and mortality, and stroke presentations are frequently atypical.","Katz, Jeffrey M.; Libman, Richard B.; Wang, Jason J.; Sanelli, Pina; Filippi, Christopher G.; Gribko, Michele; Pacia, Steven V.; Kuzniecky, Ruben I.; Najjar, Souhel; Azhar, Salman",Stroke,201,16

For this reason, a rapid alternative diagnostic option should be introduced as an automated detection method to prevent COVID-19 spreading among individuals. This article proposes multi-objective optimization and a deep-learning methodology for the detection of infected coronavirus patients with X-rays. J48 decision tree method classifies the deep characteristics of affected X-ray corona images to detect the contaminated patients effectively. Eleven different convolutional neuronal network-based (CNN) models were developed in this study to detect infected patients with coronavirus pneumonia using X-ray images (AlexNet, VGG16, VGG19, GoogleNet, ResNet18, ResNet500, ResNet101, InceptionV3, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet201 and XceptionNet). In addition, the parameters of the CNN profound learning model are described using an emperor penguin optimizer with several objectives (MOEPO). A broad review reveals that the proposed model can categorise the X-ray images at the correct rates of precision, accuracy, recall, specificity and F1-score. Extensive test results show that the proposed model outperforms competitive models with well-known efficiency metrics. The proposed model is, therefore, useful for the real-time classification of X-ray chest images of COVID-19 disease.","Dhiman, Gaurav; Vinoth Kumar, V.; Kaur, Amandeep; Sharma, Ashutosh",Interdiscip Sci,201,33

As a measure of transmissibility, we aimed to estimate concurrently the time-varying reproduction number, R0(t), over time during the COVID-19 pandemic for each of the following 12 heavily-attacked countries: Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Belgium, United Kingdom, the United States of America, and South Africa. Methods: We downloaded the publicly available COVID-19 pandemic data from the WHO COVID-19 Dashboard website (https://covid19.who.int/) for the duration of January 11, 2020 and May 1, 2020. Then, we specified two plausible distributions of serial interval to apply the novel estimation method implemented in the incidence and EpiEstim packages to the data of daily new confirmed cases for robustly estimating R0(t) in the R software. Results: We plotted the epidemic curves of daily new confirmed cases for the 12 selected countries. A clear peak of the epidemic curve appeared in 10 of the 12 selected countries at various time points, and then the epidemic curve declined gradually. However, the United States of America and South Africa happened to have two or more peaks and their epidemic curves either reached a plateau or still climbed up. Almost all curves of the estimated R0(t) monotonically went down to be less than or close to 1.0 up to April 30, 2020 except Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Iran, and South Africa, of which the curves surprisingly went up and down at various time periods during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the United States of America and South Africa were the two countries with the approximate R0(t) [≥] 1.0 at the end of April, and thus they were now facing the harshest battles against the coronavirus among the 12 selected countries. By contrast, Spain, Germany, and France with smaller values of the estimated R0(t) were relatively better than the other 9 countries. Conclusion: Seeing the estimated R0(t) going downhill speedily is more informative than looking for the drops in the daily number of new confirmed cases during an ongoing epidemic of infectious disease. We urge public health authorities and scientists to estimate R0(t) routinely during an epidemic of infectious disease and to report R0(t) daily to the public until the end of the epidemic.","Hu, F.-C.",,201,16

In this paper, a structural equation (SEM) model was proposed to compare risk knowledge, risk perception, risk aversion attitudes and behavioral intentions towards rural tourism. According to the empirical results, there was a large proportion of tourists showing preference for rural tourism recently. Potential participants in rural tourism paid most attention to the performance realization and time cost of scenic spots, while the psycho-social risk posed by COVID-19 had little impact. The inherent risk nature of risk aversion attitudes made knowledge of the pneumonia risk less effective in reducing tourists’ intentions, while knowledge of the pneumonia risk was more effective in alleviating the risk perception that potential tourists have towards rural tourism. With regard to travel intention and recommendation intention of rural tourism, the negative impacts of risk aversion attitude were more considerable compared to risk perception. Meanwhile, the parallel mediating effect of risk perception and risk aversion attitude in rural tourism needed to be taken into consideration together.","Zhu, Hui; Deng, Fumin",Int J Environ Res Public Health,201,30

We found that staff and residents were usually infected with identical, or near identical, SARS-CoV-2 genomes. Outbreaks usually involved one predominant cluster, and the same lineages persisted in LTCFs despite infection control measures. Outbreaks were most commonly due to single or few introductions followed by a spread rather than a series of seeding events from the community into LTCFs. The sequencing of samples taken consecutively from the same individuals at the same facilities showed the persistence of the same genome sequence, indicating that the sequencing technique was robust over time. When combined with local epidemiology, genomics allowed probable transmission sources to be better characterised. The transmission between LTCFs was detected in multiple studies. The mortality rate among residents was high in all facilities, regardless of the lineage. Bioinformatics methods were inadequate in a third of the studies reviewed, and reproducing the analyses was difficult because sequencing data were not available in many facilities.","Aggarwal, Dinesh; Myers, Richard; Hamilton, William L; Bharucha, Tehmina; Tumelty, Niamh M; Brown, Colin S; Meader, Emma J; Connor, Tom; Smith, Darren L; Bradley, Declan T; Robson, Samuel; Bashton, Matthew; Shallcross, Laura; Zambon, Maria; Goodfellow, Ian; Chand, Meera; O'Grady, Justin; Török, M Estée; Peacock, Sharon J; Page, Andrew J",Lancet Microbe,201,14

However, the mechanisms of establishment of persistent infection are still unclear. In this study, we investigated which signaling pathways play important roles in escape from apoptosis in cells infected with SARS-CoV. In persistently infected cells at 50 h.p.i., PI3K/Akt, JNK, p38 MAPK and Bcl-2 were phosphorylated and the protein levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were increased. When surviving cells were treated with the JNK-specific inhibitor, SP600125, at 50 h.p.i., all cells died, suggesting that the JNK signaling pathway is necessary for maintenance of persistently infected cells. Among the signaling pathways in persistently infected cells, Akt and JNK were phosphorylated in SARS-CoV-nucleocapsid (N) protein-expressing Vero E6 cells using vaccinia viral vector (DIs), strongly suggesting that N protein-induced phosphorylation of Akt and JNK are necessary to establish persistence. These results indicated that at least four proteins, Akt, JNK, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, are necessary for survival of persistently SARS-CoV-infected cells.","Mizutani, Tetsuya; Fukushi, Shuetsu; Ishii, Koji; Sasaki, Yuko; Kenri, Tsuyoshi; Saijo, Masayuki; Kanaji, Yumi; Shirota, Kinji; Kurane, Ichiro; Morikawa, Shigeru",Biochem Biophys Res Commun,201,1

Oral candidosis presents a variety of clinical forms, including pseudomembranous candidosis, erythematous candidosis, angular cheilitis, median rhomboid glossitis, cheilocandidosis, juxtavermillion candidosis, mucocutaneous candidosis, hyperplastic candidosis, oropharyngeal candidosis, and rare suppurative candidosis. The prognosis is usually favorable, but treatment failure or recurrence is common due to either incorrect diagnosis, missing other pathology, inability to address underlying risk factors, or inaccurate prescription of antifungal agents. In immunocompromised patients, oropharyngeal candidosis can spread to the bloodstream or upper gastrointestinal tract, leading to potentially lethal systemic candidosis.

Less is known about the long-term outcomes in terms of mortality and readmissions following in-patient treatment. AIM: The aim of this paper is to provide a detailed account of hospitalized COVID-19 patients up to 180 days after their initial hospital admission. METHODS: An observational study with claims data from the German Local Health Care Funds of adult patients hospitalized in Germany between February 1 and April 30, 2020, with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and a related principal diagnosis, for whom 6-month all-cause mortality and readmission rates for 180 days after admission or until death were available. A multivariable logistic regression model identified independent risk factors for 180-day all-cause mortality in this cohort. RESULTS: Of the 8,679 patients with a median age of 72 years, 2,161 (24.9%) died during the index hospitalization. The 30-day all-cause mortality rate was 23.9% (2,073/8,679), the 90-day rate was 27.9% (2,425/8,679), and the 180-day rate, 29.6% (2,566/8,679). The latter was 52.3% (1,472/2,817) for patients aged ≥80 years 23.6% (1,621/6,865) if not ventilated during index hospitalization, but 53.0% in case of those ventilated invasively (853/1,608).

We aimed to describe the main characteristics and components of these programs for healthcare workers treating COVID-19 patients in Spanish hospitals. Material and methods: An online survey was designed to evaluate the main characteristics of psychological intervention programs for healthcare workers during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Valid responses were received from 36 hospitals. Most of these programs offered both in-person and online therapy. The most common aim of these interventions was emotional regulation, which was treated by psychoeducational and cognitive-behavioural techniques in individual interventions. Group interventions mainly used psychoeducation and mindfulness. Only half of the teams that offered in-person interventions received training in the proper use of personal protective equipment. Conclusions: Several hospitals in Spain have developed mental health interventions for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, deploying a wide range of therapeutic modalities and techniques. The rapid implementation of these programs during the pandemic suggests that safety may not have received sufficient attention.

Este estudio pretende describir las principales características y componentes de los programas para trabajadores sanitarios que atienden COVID-19 en hospitales españoles. Método: Se elaboró y distribuyó una encuesta online para evaluar las principales características de los programas de intervención psicológica para trabajadores sanitarios durante la pandemia de COVID-19. Resultados: Se recibieron respuestas válidas de 36 hospitales. La mayoría de los programas ofrecía intervención presencial y online/telefónica. El principal objetivo de estos programas fue mejorar la regulación emocional. Las intervenciones individuales emplearon principalmente psicoeducación y técnicas cognitivo-conductuales, mientras que las grupales emplearon psicoeducación y mindfulness. Sólo la mitad de los equipos que ofrecían intervenciones presenciales habían recibido la formación adecuada para usar equipos de protección individual. Conclusiones: Numerosos hospitales en España han desarrollado intervenciones de salud mental para trabajadores sanitarios durante la pandemia por COVID-19, empleando una gran variedad de modalidades terapéuticas. La rápida implementación de estos programas durante la pandemia sugiere que la necesidad de seguridad ha podido subestimarse. La planificación y desarrollo de intervenciones psicológicas durante las pandemias merece mayor atención por parte de las autoridades competentes.","Priede, Amador; López-Álvarez, Inés; Carracedo-Sanchidrián, Diego; González-Blanch, César",Rev Psiquiatr Salud Ment,201,20

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder and contributing risk factors among resident doctors working in a tertiary care hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODOLOGY A cross-sectional study was conducted via an online survey from May to July 2020. Sociodemographic characteristics, exposure to the coronavirus, application of personal hygiene rules, presence and use of personal protective equipment, anxiety and prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder were investigated. RESULTS In total, 17.8% (n = 40) of 225 resident doctors who participated in the study had post-traumatic stress disorder. Working at a department serving to COVID-19 patients increased the risk of post-traumatic stress disorder by 2.9 times (OR = 2.936, p = 0.003) while contacting positive patients increased this risk by 2.6 times (OR = 2.607, p = 0.023) and lack of personal protective equipment by 3.6 times (OR = 3.656, p = 0.018). Anxiety scores were statistically significantly higher in women, married and those living with their parents or spouses and children (p = 0.049; p = 0.011; p = 0.004, respectively). CONCLUSIONS Working in a department serving to COVID-19 patients, contact with positive patients and lack of personal protective equipment were risk factors in the emergence of post-traumatic stress disorder in resident doctors. Anxiety was also found to be greater in women, married and those living with their families.","Emre, Nilufer; Edirne, Tamer; Ozsahin, Aysun; Kulceler, Muhammed Fahrettin",Journal of infection in developing countries,201,4

Drawing on the stimulus–organism–response (S–O-R) framework, this study aims to explore the impacts of peer condition and peer communication on fear of COVID-19, and the impact of fear of COVID-19 on online rumor sharing behavior, by considering the contingency effect of health self-efficacy. Data from 1167 respondents to an online survey in China were adopted to test our research model. The results indicate that peer communication and peer condition induce fear of COVID-19, and fear of COVID-19 results in online rumor sharing. Fear of COVID-19 mediates the effects of peer communication and peer condition on online rumor sharing. Health self-efficacy alleviates the positive effect of peer communication on fear of COVID-19, and the positive effect of fear of COVID-19 on online rumor sharing. This study advances the literature on online rumor sharing and S–O-R, and provides practical implications to social media users and governments.","Luo, Peng; Wang, Chenxiao; Guo, Feng; Luo, Li",Comput Human Behav,201,20

Herein we show that this process of bystander T-cell-mediated demyelination is interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-dependent. The absence of IFN-γ abrogated demyelination but did not change T-cell infiltration or expression levels of inflammatory cytokines or chemokines in the spinal cord.

Here, we explore the benefit of combination therapy with a mAb and remdesivir in a non-human primate model of Marburg virus (MARV) disease. While rhesus monkeys are protected against lethal infection when treatment with either a human mAb (MR186-YTE; 100%), or remdesivir (80%), is initiated 5 days post-inoculation (dpi) with MARV, no animals survive when either treatment is initiated alone beginning 6 dpi. However, by combining MR186-YTE with remdesivir beginning 6 dpi, significant protection (80%) is achieved, thereby extending the therapeutic window.

Evidence of a strong role of the innate immune system is accumulating, but the precise cells and mechanism involved remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the links between circulating innate phagocyte phenotype and functions and severity in COVID-19 patients. Eighty-four consecutive patients were included, 44 of which were in intensive care units (ICU). We performed an in-depth phenotyping of neutrophil and monocyte subpopulations and measured soluble activation markers in plasma. Additionally, myeloid cell functions (phagocytosis, oxidative burst, and NETosis) were evaluated on fresh cells from patients. Resulting parameters were linked to disease severity and prognosis. Both ICU and non-ICU patients had circulating neutrophils and monocytes with an activated phenotype, as well as elevated concentrations of soluble activation markers (calprotectin, myeloperoxidase, neutrophil extracellular traps, MMP9, sCD14) in their plasma. ICU patients were characterized by increased CD10low CD13low immature neutrophils, LOX-1+ and CCR5+ immunosuppressive neutrophils, and HLA-DRlow CD14low downregulated monocytes. Markers of immature and immunosuppressive neutrophils were strongly associated with severity and poor outcome. Moreover, neutrophils and monocytes of ICU patients had impaired antimicrobial functions, which correlated with organ dysfunction, severe infections, and mortality. Our study reveals a marked dysregulation of innate immunity in COVID-19 patients, which was correlated with severity and prognosis. Together, our results strongly argue in favor of a pivotal role of innate immunity in COVID-19 severe infections and pleads for targeted therapeutic options.","Peyneau, M.; Granger, V.; Wicky, P.-H.; Khelifi-Touhami, D.; Timsit, J.-F.; Lescure, F.-X.; Yazdanpanah, Y.; Tran-Dihn, A.; Montravers, P.; Monteiro, R.; Chollet-Martin, S.; Hurtado-Nedelec, M.; de Chaisemartin, L.",,201,1

However, unintended consequences of TCZ therapy include reactivation of tuberculosis (TB) or hepatitis B virus (HBV), and worsening of hepatitis C virus (HCV). We set out to assimilate existing data for these complications, in order to help inform evidence-based risk assessments for the use of TCZ, and thus to reduce the risk of serious but preventable complications. Methods: We searched the global WHO database of Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) (“VigiBase”) and undertook a systematic literature review, in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. We generated mean cumulative incidence estimates for infection complications. Results: Mean cumulative incidence of HBV and TB were 3.3 and 4.3%, respectively, in patients receiving TCZ. Insufficient data were available to generate estimates for HCV. These estimates derive from heterogeneous studies pre-dating SARS-CoV-2, with differing epidemiology and varied approaches to screening and prophylaxis, so formal meta-analysis was not possible. Conclusions: We underline the need for careful individual risk assessment prior to TCZ prescription, and present an algorithm to guide clinical stratification. There is an urgent need for ongoing collation of safety data as TCZ therapy is used in COVID.","Campbell, Cori; Andersson, Monique I.; Ansari, M.

Here, we report a case of an immunocompromised patient (non-Hodgkin lymphoma patient under immunosuppressive therapy) with a persistent SARS-CoV-2 infection (marked by intermittent positivity) over at least 6 months. Viral genome sequencing was performed at days 1, 164, and 171 to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 evolution. Among the 15 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (11 leading to amino acid alterations) and 3 deletions accumulated during this long-term infection, four amino acid changes (V3G, S50L, N87S, and A222V) and two deletions (18-30del and 141-144del) occurred in the virus Spike protein. Although no convalescent plasma therapy was administered, some of the detected mutations have been independently reported in other chronically infected individuals, which supports a scenario of convergent adaptive evolution. This study shows that it is of the utmost relevance to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 evolution in immunocompromised individuals, not only to identify novel potentially adaptive mutations, but also to mitigate the risk of introducing “hyper-evolved” variants in the community. IMPORTANCE Tracking the within-patient evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is key to understanding how this pandemic virus shapes its genome toward immune evasion and survival. In the present study, by monitoring a long-term COVID-19 immunocompromised patient, we observed the concurrent emergence of mutations potentially associated with immune evasion and/or enhanced transmission, mostly targeting the SARS-CoV-2 key host-interacting protein and antigen. These findings show that the frequent oscillation in the immune status in immunocompromised individuals can trigger an accelerated virus evolution, thus consolidating this study model as an accelerated pathway to better understand SARS-CoV-2 adaptive traits and anticipate the emergence of variants of concern.","Borges, Vítor; Isidro, Joana; Cunha, Mário; Cochicho, Daniela; Martins, Luís; Banha, Luís; Figueiredo, Margarida; Rebelo, Leonor; Trindade, Maria Céu; Duarte, Sílvia; Vieira, Luís; Alves, Maria João; Costa, Inês; Guiomar, Raquel; Santos, Madalena; Cortê-Real, Rita; Dias, André; Póvoas, Diana; Cabo, João; Figueiredo, Carlos; Manata, Maria José; Maltez, Fernando; Gomes da Silva, Maria; Gomes, João Paulo",mSphere,201,30

Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been shown to be a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 to enter host target cells. Given that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) upregulated ACE2 expression in animal studies, the concern might arise regarding whether ARBs and ACEIs would increase the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19. On the other hand, animal data suggested a potential protective effect of ARBs against COVID-19 pneumonia because an ARB prevented the aggravation of acute lung injury in mice infected with SARS-CoV, which is closely related to SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, however, there is no clinical or experimental evidence supporting that ARBs and ACEIs either augment the susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 or aggravate the severity and outcomes of COVID-19 at present.

Objective To determine whether an online 1-day cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based workshop added to treatment as usual improves PPD, anxiety, social support, mother-infant relationship quality, and infant temperament more than treatment as usual alone. Design, Setting, and Participants This randomized clinical trial included 403 women with PPD who were recruited across Ontario, Canada, during the COVID-19 pandemic (April 20 to October 4, 2020). Women with Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores of at least 10 who were 18 years or older and had an infant younger than 12 months were eligible. Interventions Women were randomly assigned to receive a live, interactive online 1-day CBT-based workshop delivered by a registered psychotherapist, psychiatrist, or clinical psychology graduate student in addition to treatment as usual (n = 202) or to receive treatment as usual and wait-listed to receive the workshop 12 weeks later (n = 201). Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was change in PPD (EPDS scores) in experimental and wait list control groups 12 weeks after baseline. Secondary outcomes included maternal anxiety (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire [GAD-7]), social support (Social Provisions Scale), quality of the mother-infant relationship (Postpartum Bonding Questionnaire), and infant temperament (Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised Very Short Form). Results Participants all identified as women with a mean (SD) age of 31.8 (4.4) years. The workshop led to significant mean (SD) reductions in EPDS scores (from 16.47 [4.41] to 11.65 [4.83]; B = -4.82; P < .001) and was associated with a higher odds of exhibiting a clinically significant decrease in EPDS scores (odds ratio, 4.15; 95% CI, 2.66-6.46). The mean (SD) GAD-7 scores decreased from 12.41 (5.12) to 7.97 (5.54) after the workshop (B = -4.44; 95% CI, -5.47 to -3.38; P < .001) and participants were more likely to experience a clinically significant change (odds ratio, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.99-4.81). Mothers also reported improvements in bonding (B = -3.22; 95% CI, -4.72 to -1.71; P < .001), infant-focused anxiety (B = -1.64; 95% CI, -2.25 to 1.00; P < .001), social support (B = 3.31; 95% CI, 1.04 to 5.57; P < .001), and positive affectivity/surgency in infants (B = 0.31; 95% CI, 0.05 to 0.56; P < .001).

Results: A young Romani woman was the first case reported and epidemiological investigation established a possible link with the funeral of a deceased member of this community. In total, 150 close contacts within 34 family groups in two cities were traced, and 109 (72.7%) Romani individuals were found to be infected by COVID-19. The patient's median age was 31 years, 58% were female, and the highest (20.2%) incidence occurred in the 0–9 years age group. A total of 26 (23.8%) patients developed typical SARS-CoV-2 symptoms, 15 (57.8%) were hospitalized, and 21 (22.1%) had comorbidities [most commonly hypertension (28.6%) and/or coronary heart diseases (23.8%)]. The outbreak was effectively controlled through compulsory quarantine and enhanced active surveillance. Conclusions: This is the first study providing insight into COVID-19 transmission dynamics among a Romani population living in Italy. These findings support general conclusions about the role of crowded social gatherings in SARS-CoV-2 spread, the high communicability among close contacts and household settings, and the impact of asymptomatic carriers. These features are of relevance to certain Romani customs where family gatherings are a fundamental pillar of their lives. Although difficulties emerged in interacting with Romani people related to cultural drivers, beliefs, and lifestyle, the outbreak management was effective and should be considered as a valuable model applicable to similar incidents occurring in minority populations.","Ripabelli, Giancarlo; Sammarco, Michela Lucia; Cannizzaro, Fabio; Montanaro, Carmen; Ponzio, Guido Vincenzo; Tamburro, Manuela",Front Med (Lausanne),201,28

Synthetic vessels that are made of biodegradable-nanofiber polymers have significant properties such as proper biodegradability and efficient physical properties such as high strength and flexibility. Some of the best options for supporting cells in soft tissue engineering and design are applications of thermoplastic polyurethane polymer in the venous tissue. In this study, the first nanoparticle-reinforced polymeric artificial prosthesis was designed and tested to be used in the human body. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, artificial gastrointestinal lumen were fabricated and prepared using a 3D printer. To improve cell adhesion, wettability properties and mechanical stability of elastin biopolymer with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) as well as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) were prepared as separate filaments. MNPs were made in 5–7 mm sizes and then examined for mechanical, biological, and hyperthermia properties. Then, the obtained results of the gastrointestinal lumen were simulated using the Abaqus software package with a three-branch. The results were evaluated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for morphology and phase analysis. RESULTS: The obtained results of the designed vessels showed remarkable improvement in mechanical properties of the SWCNT vessels and hyperthermia properties of the vessels containing the MNPs. The results of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis showed that the artificial vessels had lower shear stress at the output. CONCLUSION: Five-mm MNP containing vessels showed noticeable chemical and biological properties along with ideal magnetic results in the treatment of thrombosis and vascular obstruction.","Karbasian, Matin; Eftekhari, Seyed Ali; Karimzadeh Kolamroudi, Mohammad; Kamyab Moghadas, Bahareh; Nasri, Peiman; Jasemi, Amir; Telloo, Mahshid; Saber-Samandari, Saeed; Khandan, Amirsalar",Iran J Basic Med Sci,201,16

This research describes the development of a model which optimizes a global green ammonia network, considering the costs of production, storage, and transport. In generating the model, we show economies of scale for green ammonia production are small beyond 1 million tonnes per annum (MMTPA), although benefits accrue up to a production rate of 10 MMTPA if a production facility is serviced by a new port or requires a long pipeline. The model demonstrates that optimal sites for ammonia production require not only an excellent renewable resource but also ample land from which energy can be harvested. Land limitations constrain project size in otherwise optimal locations and force production to more expensive sites. Comparison of current crude oil markets to future ammonia markets reveals a trend away from global supply hubs and toward demand centers serviced by regional production.","Salmon, Nicholas; Bañares-Alcántara, René; Nayak-Luke, Richard",iScience,201,1

The pandemic has caused considerable death and suffering, triggered economic downturns, and led to significant job loss. Both during and after the pandemic, sophisticated and effective measures must be taken to diagnose COVID-19 patients and mitigate the effects of the virus. Emerging developments in the Internet of Things (IoT), 4G, 5G, and 6G wireless networks, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain technology can be harnessed to combat COVID-19. The implementation of IoT in hospitals enables highly integrated digital environments and real-time data collection, which can be utilized to identify clinical patterns, model risk interactions, and forecast effects via AI and deep learning systems. This article emphasizes the potential uses of IoT, AI, and 5G for combating pandemics similar to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Immunosenescence reduces the ability to respond to neoantigens and may compromise the life of infected individuals. Here, we analyzed the immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 in 102 recovered patients aged over 60 years several months after the infection had been resolved. Specific memory T lymphocytes against the virus were measured by interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and granzyme B release by ELISpot; memory B-lymphocyte responses were quantified by detection of anti-S IgG1 producer cells by ELISpot and anti-S and anti-N antibodies were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Memory T lymphocytes were found in peripheral blood of most of the studied donors, more than 7 months after the infection in some of them. Fewer patients maintained memory B lymphocytes, but antibodies, mainly anti-S, were highly durable and positively correlated with T responses. More robust humoral responses were found in patients who had more severe symptoms and had been admitted to hospital. We concluded that specific immunity against SARS-CoV-2 is effectively preserved regardless of age, despite the great heterogeneity of their immune responses, and that memory T lymphocytes and anti-S IgG might be more durable than memory B cells and anti-N IgG.","García-Torre, Alejandra; Bueno-García, Eva; López-Martínez, Rocío; Rioseras, Beatriz; Moro-García, Marco Antonio; Alonso-Alvarez, Sara; Lluna-González, Alba; Sousa-Fernández, Alejandra; Fernández-Gudin, Marta; Campos-Riopedre, Laura; Castro-del Cueto, Corina; Pérez-Fernández, Ana Belén; Alonso-Rodríguez, Ana; Menéndez-Peña, Carla; Menéndez-Peña, Lara; García-Arnaldo, Noelia; Feito-Díaz, Estefanía; Fernández-Lorences, Adriana; Fraile-Manzano, Agustín; Fernández-Iglesias, Carolina; Rivera, José Arturo; Pérez-Fonseca, Carmen; Urdiales-Ruano, Estibaliz; Debán-Fernández, María; Mendes-Moreira, Hugo; Herrero-Puente, Pablo; Alonso-Arias, Rebeca",J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci,201,1

Also, it aimed to analyze the resulted Balanced Scorecard (BSC) dimensions during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) era. This systematic review was prepared according to PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Google Scholar databases, as well as Google search engine, were inspected to find all implementations of BSC at HCOs until 20 September 2020. The Risk of Bias (RoB) was assessed for each included article. The eligible studies were 33, in which 36 BSC implementations were identified. The categorization and re-grouping of the 797 KPIs resulted in 13 major-dimensions: The financial, efficiency and effectiveness, availability and quality of supplies and services, managerial tasks, Health Care Workers (HCWs) scientific development error-free and safety, the time, HCW-centeredness, patient-centeredness, technology and information system, community care and reputation, HCO building, and the communication. Under them, 45 sub-dimension were identified. The high RoB in most implementations was due to the selection bias. None of the 36 BSC implementations was utilized during the COVID-19 pandemic. This review solves the dilemma of categorization differences among BSC implementations, which in turn will improve the data sharing and comparability among studies. A modification for the BSC design to include external and managerial perspectives is required. However, a lack of a comprehensive PE for HCOs during the pandemic was observed, so the resulted dimensions and KPIs are recommended for planning, monitoring, evaluation, and continuous improvement of HCOs. Many dimensions were negatively influenced by the pandemic. However, some dimensions still need further investigation. BSC dimensions have an essential role in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic and will help the health care managers to mitigate its consequences on HCOs.","Amer, F.; Hammoud, S.; Khatatbeh, H.; Lohner, S.; Boncz, I.; Endrei, D.",,201,20

However, public interest and demand for telehealth during the pandemic remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: We used an infodemiological approach to estimate the worldwide demand for telehealth services during COVID-19, focusing on the 50 most affected countries and comparing the demand for such services with the level of information and communications technology (ICT) infrastructure available. METHODS: We used Google Trends, the Baidu Index (China), and Yandex Keyword Statistics (Russia) to extract data on worldwide and individual countries’ telehealth-related internet searches from January 1 to July 7, 2020, presented as relative search volumes (RSV; range 0-100). Daily COVID-19 cases and deaths were retrieved from the World Health Organization. Individual countries’ ICT infrastructure profiles were retrieved from the World Economic Forum Report. RESULTS: Across the 50 countries, the mean RSV was 18.5 (SD 23.2), and the mean ICT index was 62.1 (SD 15.0). An overall spike in worldwide telehealth-related RSVs was observed from March 11, 2020 (RSV peaked to 76.0), which then tailed off in June-July 2020 (mean RSV for the period was 25.8), but remained higher than pre-March RSVs (mean 7.29). By country, 42 (84%) manifested increased RSVs over the evaluation period, with the highest observed in Canada (RSV=100) and the United States (RSV=96). When evaluating associations between RSV and the ICT index, both the United States and Canada demonstrated high RSVs and ICT scores (≥70.3). In contrast, European countries had relatively lower RSVs (range 3.4-19.5) despite high ICT index scores (mean 70.3). Several Latin American (Brazil, Chile, Colombia) and South Asian (India, Bangladesh, Pakistan) countries demonstrated relatively higher RSVs (range 13.8-73.3) but low ICT index scores (mean 44.6), indicating that the telehealth demand outstrips the current ICT infrastructure. CONCLUSIONS: There is generally increased interest and demand for telehealth services across the 50 countries most affected by COVID-19, highlighting the need to scale up telehealth capabilities, during and beyond the pandemic.","Wong, Mark Yu Zheng; Gunasekeran, Dinesh Visva; Nusinovici, Simon; Sabanayagam, Charumathi; Yeo, Khung Keong; Cheng, Ching-Yu; Tham, Yih-Chung",JMIR Public Health Surveill,201,8

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical activity of 3740 de-identified patients at NYULH between January and August 2020. Models were trained on clinical data during different parts of their hospital stay to predict three clinical outcomes: deceased, ventilated, or admitted to ICU. RESULTS: XGBoost model trained on clinical data from the final 24 hours excelled at predicting mortality (AUC=0.92, specificity=86% and sensitivity=85%). Respiration rate was the most important feature, followed by SpO2 and age 75+. Performance of this model to predict the deceased outcome extended 5 days prior with AUC=0.81, specificity=70%, sensitivity=75%. When only using clinical data from the first 24 hours, AUCs of 0.79, 0.80, and 0.77 were obtained for deceased, ventilated, or ICU admitted, respectively. Although respiration rate and SpO2 levels offered the highest feature importance, other canonical markers including diabetic history, age and temperature offered minimal gain. When lab values were incorporated, prediction of mortality benefited the most from blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Features predictive of morbidity included LDH, calcium, glucose, and C-reactive protein (CRP).

The aim of this study is to present a two-stage mathematical model for identifying critical manufacturing factors in the innovation process of air conditioning. In this paper, Kano and quality function deployment (QFD) are used to analyze the critical factors affecting air-conditioning innovation. Some studies have proposed using Kano-QFD model to analyze product innovation, but the study only studies one stage, which loses the analysis of the subsequent stages of product innovation. Based on this, this paper studies the priority method of two-stage critical factors for air-conditioning innovation. Firstly, the questionnaire survey and fuzzy sets are used to collect demand information of multi-agent (customers and professional technicians). Secondly, the Kano model is used to classify and calculate satisfaction of multi-agent. Then, QFD is used to transform multi-agent demands into engineering property indexes (first stage) and technical property indexes (second stage) and calculate the weight of each index. Finally, the applicability and superiority of this method is illustrated by taking the central air-conditioning as an example.","Yu, Yinyun; Li, Congdong; Yang, Weiming; Xu, Wei",PLoS One,201,3

In addition to the few vaccines already in use, many other candidates are in preclinical phases or experimental stages in humans. Despite the fact that the availability of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine constitutes a major advance and appear to be the only way to control the pandemic, some investigation remains to be carried out, and this is notably concerning the impact on transmissibility, the duration of the conferred protection in the mid- and long term, the effectiveness against present and future viral mutants, or the ideal schedule that should be applied. In this paper, we review the circumstances that facilitated such a rapid development of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and summarize the different vaccine platforms under investigation as well as their present results and perspectives in different settings. We also discuss the indications of vaccination under special conditions, such as a history of previous COVID-19 infection or belonging to extreme age categories like children and elderly.

This study was aimed at developing a statistical approach to empirically analyze the academic integrity of the online exams. Data were collected retrospectively from academic records of Physiology and Anatomy courses of a private medical college, in which students had attempted sequential on-campus and online modular exams. We developed a statistical model to predict on-campus and online exam scores of undergraduate medical students, from their previous academic records. Hypothesizing that the predictor model contains comparable explanatory power for both exams, we utilized the explanatory power variation (R(2) statistics) of the improvised model to predict academic dishonesty behavior in traditional vs online exams. Reduced explanatory power (R(2 )statistics) of the model for any mode of the exam, in which students scored considerably different from their previous academic record, was interpreted as indirect evidence of academic dishonesty. Our model explained a large proportion of variation (R(2)) in overall scores of on-campus and online Physiology and Anatomy modules. Whereas, the model could explain only a small proportion of variation in scores of online theory exams, with a moderate effect size (adjusted R(2)). Reduced explanatory power for both Physiology and Anatomy online theory exams implies the chance of academic dishonesty in this particular component of the online exam. Explanatory power variation of a predictor statistical model can be further explored and utilized to monitor academic integrity in future online exams.","Ikram, Faiza; Rabbani, Muhammad Ali",Cureus,201,16

Few studies have focused on the relationship between workplace policy and individual behaviours. This study aimed to identify inequalities of workplace policy across occupation groups, examine the relationship of workplace guidelines and measures with employees’ behaviours regarding COVID-19 prevention. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey using a structured questionnaire was conducted to gather employees’ access to workplace guidelines and measures as well as their personal protection behaviours. Statistical associations between these two factors in different occupations were examined using multiple ordinal logistic regressions. RESULTS: A total of 1048 valid responses across five occupational groups were analysed. Manual labourers reported lower availability of workplace guidelines and measures (76.9% vs. 89.9% for all, P = 0.003). Employees with available workplace guidelines and measures had higher compliance of hand hygiene, wearing masks, and social distancing, and this association was more significant among managers/administrators and manual labourers. CONCLUSIONS: Protection of the quantity and quality of employment is important. Awareness about the disease and its prevention among employers and administrators should be promoted, and resources should be allocated to publish guidelines and implement measures in the workplace during the pandemic. Both work-from-home arrangement and other policies and responses for those who cannot work from home including guidelines encouraging the health behaviours, information transparency, and provision of infection control materials by employers should be established to reduce inequality. Manual labourers may require specific attention regarding accessibility of relevant information and availability of medical benefits and compensation for income loss due to the sickness, given their poorer experience of workplace policy and the nature of their work. Further studies are needed to test the effectiveness of specific workplace policies on COVID-19 prevention.

Responding to humanitarian crises involves saving lives and reducing suffering and as such, palliative care is an essential component of the response to COVID-19. This study aimed to explore health professionals’ perspectives of the role of palliative care during the COVID-19 pandemic by analyzing their views and experiences expressed in articles and blogs located via Twitter. METHOD: Qualitative content analysis of 33 online articles and blogs written by health professionals from 1 February 2020 to 30 June 2020. Online articles and blogs were included if the URL was posted on Twitter. The consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) guided data collection and reporting. RESULTS: The health professionals whose viewpoints were analyzed were from Europe, North America, Oceania and Asia. The themes derived from content analysis were (a) the recognized value of palliative care during the pandemic, (b) positioning palliative care as every health professional’s responsibility and (c) specialist palliative care supporting and guiding health professionals CONCLUSIONS: This study utilizes a unique approach to exploring the perspectives of health professionals from several countries during a global pandemic. The study emphasizes the value of palliative care and identifies gaps in end-of-life care provision including resource allocation. This brings to light the urgent need to equip all health professionals with palliative care knowledge and skills, including discussing and planning care.

Protocol for the PEAK randomised controlled trial,20.045132,8.550372,2020-08-07,"Amid the coronavirus outbreak, many countries are facing a dramatic situation in terms of the global economy and human social activities, including education. The shutdown of schools is affecting many students around the world, with face-to-face classes suspended. Many countries facing the disastrous situation imposed class suspension at an early stage of the coronavirus outbreak, and Asia was one of the earliest regions to implement live online learning. Despite previous research on online teaching and learning, students' readiness to participate in the real-time online learning implemented during the coronavirus outbreak is not yet well understood. This study explored several key factors in the research framework related to learning motivation, learning readiness and student's self-efficacy in participating in live online learning during the coronavirus outbreak, taking into account gender differences and differences among sub-degree (SD), undergraduate (UG) and postgraduate (PG) students. Technology readiness was used instead of conventional online/internet self-efficacy to determine students' live online learning readiness. The hypothetical model was validated using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The results revealed no statistically significant differences between males and females. On the other hand, the mean scores for PG students were higher than for UG and SD students based on the post hoc test. We argue that during the coronavirus outbreak, gender differences were reduced because students are forced to learn more initiatively. We also suggest that students studying at a higher education degree level may have higher expectations of their academic achievement and were significantly different in their online learning readiness. This study has important implications for educators in implementing live online learning, particularly for the design of teaching contexts for students from different educational levels. More virtual activities should be considered to enhance the motivation for students undertaking lower-level degrees, and encouragement of student-to-student interactions can be considered.","Tang, Yuk Ming; Chen, Pen Chung; Law, Kris M.Y.; Wu, C.H.; Lau, Yui-yip; Guan, Jieqi; He, Dan; Ho, G.T.S.",Comput Educ,201,17

During the pandemic, affordable healthcare was widely available in Japan and the medical system did not suffer a collapse, making accurate comparisons between prefectures possible. For the 16 prefectures included in this study that had daily maximum confirmed cases exceeding ten, the number of daily confirmed cases follow bell-shape or log-normal distribution in most prefectures. A good correlation was observed between the spread and decay durations. However, some exceptions were observed in areas where travelers returned from foreign countries, which were defined as the origins of infection clusters. Excluding these prefectures, the population density was shown to be a major factor, affecting the spread and decay patterns, with R(2) = 0.39 (p < 0.05) and 0.42 (p < 0.05), respectively, approximately corresponding to social distancing. The maximum absolute humidity was found to affect the decay duration normalized by the population density (R(2) > 0.36, p < 0.05). Our findings indicate that the estimated pandemic spread duration, based on the multivariate analysis of maximum absolute humidity, ambient temperature, and population density (adjusted R(2) = 0.53, p-value < 0.05), could prove useful for intervention planning during potential future pandemics, including a second COVID-19 outbreak.","Rashed, Essam A.; Kodera, Sachiko; Gomez-Tames, Jose; Hirata, Akimasa",Int J Environ Res Public Health,201,16

This was an exploratory qualitative study, which used the theoretical-methodological framework of the Discourse Analysis of French matrix, guided by the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research. The study was conducted in Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo, Brazil. Seven participants were interviewed who were undergoing treatment at the time of the interview. The analysis of the participants’ discourses allowed the emergence of four discursive blocks: (1) impact of the social determinants in the development of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, (2) barriers to seeking care and difficulties accessing health services, (3) perceptions of the side effects and their impact on multidrug-resistant tuberculosis treatment, and (4) tuberculosis and COVID-19: a necessary dialogue.

However, there are major gaps between the needs of young Black male survivors of violent injury and the forms of care provided by HVIPs. Patient-centered outcomes research provides a useful mode of inquiry to develop strategies to decrease these differences. Care for survivors, including treatment for traumatic stress disorders, must be reconceptualized to center the lived experiences of young Black men. This paper qualitatively explores how these survivors of gun violence express symptoms of traumatic stress and the ways in which their narratives can inform the implementation of the biopsychosocial model in HVIPs. A phenomenological variant ecological systems theory framework was used to analyze participant narratives to aid in understanding their symptoms of traumatic stress and post-injury affective changes as both psychologically and socially important experiences.

Caseins, whey proteins, secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), mucins, tryptophan, and growth factors are among milk‐borne elements that are directly important in the control of mucosa development and protection. Consequently, breastfeeding is associated with the low incidence of gastrointestinal inflammation and with the decrease in respiratory diseases during postnatal period. The novel coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) binds to angiotensin II‐converting enzyme (ACE2) on the cell membrane, allowing virus entrance, replication, and host commitment. ACE2 is expressed by different cell types, which include ciliated cells in the lungs and enterocytes in the intestine. Such cells are highly active in metabolism, as they internalize molecules to be processed and used by the organism. The disruption of ACE2 impairs leads to intestinal inflammation and decreased synthesis of serotonin, affecting motility. By reviewing the effects of SARS‐CoV‐2 in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts in infants, and gut responses to breastfeeding interruption, we suggest that it is important to maintain breastfeeding during SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, as it might be essential to protect newborns from gastrointestinal‐associated disorders and relieve disease symptoms.","Vasques da Costa, Aline; Purcell Goes, Carolina; Gama, Patrícia",Physiol Rep,201,11

The incidence and mortality of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are considered to be correlated with vitamin D levels. Vitamin D synthesis in human skin is closely related to exposure to UVB radiation. Therefore, the incidence and mortality of COVID-19 are also considered to be correlated with Vitamin D levels.

Regular and proper hand hygiene by caregivers and food handlers in particular is essential to decontaminate hands and potentially interrupt such spread. What would be considered a proper decontamination of hands? Handwashing with regular soap and water is often considered sufficient, but what of hygienic handwash and handrub antiseptic products? Are they more effective? The evidence suggests that some clearly are. Activity against bacteria may not reflect the ability of hygienic hand antiseptics to deal with viruses, especially those that are nonenveloped. In spite of the acknowledged importance of hands as vehicles for viruses, there is a lack of suitable regulatory mechanism for handwash or handrub products to make claims of efficacy against viruses. This is in contrast with the ability of general-purpose disinfectants to make antiviral claims, although transmission of viruses from surfaces other than those of reusable medical devices may play only a minor role in virus transmission. This review discusses the (1) recent information on the relative importance of viruses as human pathogens, particularly those causing enteric and respiratory infections; (2) the survival of relevant viruses on human hands in comparison with common gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria; (3) the potential of hands to transfer or receive such contamination on casual contact; (4) role of hands in the spread of viruses; (5) the potential of hygienic measures to eliminate viruses from contaminated hands; (6) relative merits of available protocols to assess the activity of hygienic hand antiseptics against viruses; and (7) factors considered crucial in any tests to assess the activity of hygienic hand antiseptics against viruses. In addition, this review proposes surrogate viruses in such testing and discusses issues for additional consideration by researchers, manufacturers, end-users, and regulators.

E3L is highly conserved among orthopoxviruses and hence could provide important protective T-cell epitopes that should be retained in any subunit or attenuated vaccine. We have therefore evaluated the immunogenicity of E3L in healthy VV vaccinated donors. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers (n=13) who had previously received a smallpox vaccine (Dryvax®) were activated and expanded using overlapping E3L peptides and their function, specificity and anti-viral activity was analyzed. E3L-specific T-cells were expanded from 7 of 12 (58.3%) vaccinated healthy donors. 25% of these produced CD8+ T-cell responses and 87.5% produced CD4+ T-cells. We identified epitopes restricted by HLA-B35 and HLA-DR15. E3L-specific T-cells killed peptide-loaded target cells as well as vaccinia-infected cells but only CD8+ T-cells could prevent the spread of infectious virus in virus inhibition assays. The epitopes recognized by E3L-specific T-cells were shared with monkeypox and although there was a single amino acid change in the variola epitope homolog, it was recognized by vaccinia-specific T-cells. Therefore it might be important to include E3L in any deletion mutant or subunit vaccine and E3L could provide a useful antigen to monitor protective immunity in humans.","Ando, Jun; Ngo, Minhtran C.; Ando, Miki; Leen, Ann; Rooney, Cliona M.",Cytotherapy,201,14

Also, rapid neutralizing antibody discovery can be made possible by a strategy that selects for those interfering with pathogen and host interaction(5). Here we report the discovery of antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, from a highly diverse naïve human Fab library. Lead antibody 5A6 blocks the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the viral spike from binding to the host receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), neutralizes SARS-CoV-2 infection of Vero E6 cells, and reduces viral replication in reconstituted human nasal and bronchial epithelium models. 5A6 has a high occupancy on the viral surface and exerts its neutralization activity via a bivalent binding mode to the tip of two neighbouring RBDs at the ACE2 interaction interface, one in the “up” and the other in the “down” position, explaining its superior neutralization capacity. Furthermore, 5A6 is insensitive to several spike mutations identified in clinical isolates, including the D614G mutant that has become dominant worldwide. Our results suggest that 5A6 could be an effective prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of COVID-19.","Wang, Bei; Asarnow, Daniel; Lee, Wen-Hsin; Huang, Ching-Wen; Faust, Bryan; Ng, Patricia Miang Lon; Ngoh, Eve Zi Xian; Bohn, Markus; Bulkley, David; Pizzorno, Andrés; Tan, Hwee Ching; Lee, Chia Yin; Minhat, Rabiatul Adawiyah; Terrier, Olivier; Soh, Mun Kuen; Teo, Frannie Jiuyi; Yeap, Yvonne Yee Chin; Hu, Yuanyu; Seah, Shirley Gek Kheng; Maurer-Stroh, Sebastian; Renia, Laurent; Hanson, Brendon John; Rosa-Calatrava, Manuel; Manglik, Aashish; Cheng, Yifan; Craik, Charles S.; Wang, Cheng-I",bioRxiv,201,16

Understanding patterns of information flow in conversations is a critical step in assessing and improving communication quality. In this paper, we describe COnversational DYnamics Model (CODYM) analysis, a novel approach for studying patterns of information flow in conversations. CODYMs are Markov Models that capture sequential dependencies in the lengths of speaker turns. The proposed method is automated and scalable, and preserves the privacy of the conversational participants. The primary function of CODYM analysis is to quantify and visualize patterns of information flow, concisely summarized over sequential turns from one or more conversations. Our approach is general and complements existing methods, providing a new tool for use in the analysis of any type of conversation. As an important first application, we demonstrate the model on transcribed conversations between palliative care clinicians and seriously ill patients. These conversations are dynamic and complex, taking place amidst heavy emotions, and include difficult topics such as end-of-life preferences and patient values. We use CODYMs to identify normative patterns of information flow in serious illness conversations, show how these normative patterns change over the course of the conversations, and show how they differ in conversations where the patient does or doesn’t audibly express anger or fear. Potential applications of CODYMs range from assessment and training of effective healthcare communication to comparing conversational dynamics across languages, cultures, and contexts with the prospect of identifying universal similarities and unique “fingerprints” of information flow.","Clarfeld, Laurence A.; Gramling, Robert; Rizzo, Donna M.; Eppstein, Margaret J.",PLoS One,201,1

We developed 12 primary bat cell lines from seven bat species, including Tylonycteris pachypus, Pipistrellus abramus and Rhinolophus sinicus (hosts of Tylonycteris-BatCoV HKU4, Pipistrellus-BatCoV HKU5, and SARS-related-CoV respectively), and tested their susceptibilities to MERS-CoVs, SARS-CoV, and human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E). Five cell lines, including P. abramus and R. sinicus but not T. pachypus cells, were susceptible to human MERS-CoV EMC/2012. However, three tested camel MERS-CoV strains showed different infectivities, with only two strains capable of infecting three and one cell lines respectively. SARS-CoV can only replicate in R. sinicus cells, while HCoV-229E cannot replicate in any bat cells. Bat dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) sequences were closely related to those of human and non-human primates but distinct from dromedary DPP4 sequence. Critical residues for binding to MERS-CoV spike protein were mostly conserved in bat DPP4. DPP4 was expressed in the five bat cells susceptible to MERS-CoV, with significantly higher mRNA expression levels than those in non-susceptible cells (P = 0.0174), supporting that DPP4 expression is critical for MERS-CoV infection in bats. However, overexpression of T. pachypus DPP4 failed to confer MERS-CoV susceptibility in T. pachypus cells, suggesting other cellular factors in determining viral replication. The broad cellular tropism of MERS-CoV should prompt further exploration of host diversity of related viruses to identify its ancestral origin.","Lau, Susanna K. P.; Fan, Rachel Y. Y.; Luk, Hayes K.

This may result from normal variation in strain on available resources, chronic strain in persistently under-resourced settings, and less commonly because of acute surges in demand, as seen during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies confirmed existing evidence that high ICU strain is associated with ICU triage decisions, and that ICU strain may be associated with ICU patient mortality. Studies also demonstrated earlier discharge of ICU patients during high strain, suggesting that strain may promote patient flow efficiency. Several studies of strain resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic provided support for the concept of adaptability – that the surge not only caused detrimental strain but also provided experience with a novel disease entity such that outcomes improved over time. Chronically resource-limited settings faced even more challenging circumstances because of acute-on-chronic strain during the pandemic. SUMMARY: The interaction between resource limitation and care delivery and outcomes is complex and incompletely understood. The COVID-19 pandemic provides a learning opportunity for strain response during both pandemic and nonpandemic times.","Anesi, George L.; Kerlin, Meeta Prasad",Curr Opin Crit Care,201,26

Patient pathway analysis identifies mismatches between TB patient care-seeking patterns and service coverage, but to date, studies have only employed cross-sectional aggregate data. METHODS: We developed an algorithmic approach to analyse and interpret patient-level routine data on healthcare use and to construct patients’ pathways from initial care-seeking to treatment outcome. We applied this to patients with TB in a simple random sample of one million patients’ records in the Taiwan National Health Insurance database. We analysed heterogeneity in pathway patterns, delays, service coverage and patient flows between different health system levels. RESULTS: We constructed 7255 pathways for 6258 patients. Patients most commonly initially sought care at the primary clinic level, where the capacity for diagnosing TB patients was 12%, before eventually initiating treatment at higher levels. Patient pathways are extremely heterogeneous prior to diagnosis, with the 10% most complex pathways accounting for 48% of all clinical encounters, and 55% of those pathways yet to initiate treatment after a year. Extended consideration of alternative diagnoses was more common for patients aged 65 years or older and for patients with chronic lung disease. CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that longitudinal analysis of routine individual-level healthcare data can be used to generate a detailed picture of TB care-seeking pathways. This allows an understanding of several temporal aspects of care pathways, including lead times to care and the variability in patient pathways.","Ku, Chu-Chang; Chen, Chien-Chou; Dixon, Simon; Lin, Hsien Ho; Dodd, Peter J",BMJ Glob Health,201,23

Most people infected with MERS-CoV develop severe acute respiratory illness. It was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has since spread to several other countries. We report the clinical course of MERS-CoV infection in a pregnant woman who acquired the infection during the last trimester. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient is a 33-year-old female working as a critical care nurse. She was 32 weeks pregnant when she presented with respiratory symptoms after direct contact with a MERS-COV patient. Although the patient was in respiratory failure, necessitated mechanical ventilation, and intensive care (ICU) admission, a healthy infant was delivered. The mother recovered. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of a laboratory-confirmed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus in a pregnant woman. CONCLUSIONS: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) known to cause severe acute respiratory illness associated with a high risk of mortality Various factors may have contributed to the successful outcome of this patient such as young age, presentation during the last stages of pregnancy, and possible differences in immune response.","Alserehi, Haleema; Wali, Ghassan; Alshukairi, Abeer; Alraddadi, Basem",BMC Infect Dis,201,20

In COVID-19, the infection and immune hyperactivation causes accumulation of inflammatory immune cells, blood clots, and protein aggregates in lung fluid, increased lung alveolar wall thickness, and upregulation of serum cytokine levels. A serum protein called serum amyloid P (SAP) has a calming effect on the innate immune system and shows efficacy as a therapeutic for fibrosis in animal models and clinical trials. In this report, we show that aspiration of the GU-rich ssRNA oligonucleotide ORN06 into mouse lungs induces all of the above COVID-19-like symptoms. Men tend to have more severe COVID-19 symptoms than women, and in the aspirated ORN06 model, male mice tended to have more severe symptoms than female mice. Intraperitoneal injections of SAP starting from day 1 post ORN06 aspiration attenuated the ORN06-induced increase in the number of inflammatory cells and formation of clot-like aggregates in the mouse lung fluid, reduced ORN06-increased alveolar wall thickness and accumulation of exudates in the alveolar airspace, and attenuated an ORN06-induced upregulation of the inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, IL-12p70, IL-23, and IL-27 in serum. Together, these results suggest that aspiration of ORN06 is a simple model for both COVID-19 as well as cytokine storm in general, and that SAP is a potential therapeutic for diseases with COVID-19-like symptoms as well as diseases that generate a cytokine storm.","Karhadkar, Tejas R.; Pilling, Darrell; Gomer, Richard H.",bioRxiv,201,1

Researchers have sought to inform the pandemic response through a diverse set of methodologies, including early efforts modelling anticipated increases in GBV. For example, in April 2020, a highly cited modelling effort by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and partners projected headline global figures of 31 million additional cases of intimate partner violence due to 6 months of lockdown, and an additional 13 million child marriages by 2030. In this paper, we discuss the rationale for using modelling to make projections about GBV, and use the projections released by UNFPA to draw attention to the assumptions and biases underlying model-based projections. We raise five key critiques: (1) reducing complex issues to simplified, linear cause-effect relationships, (2) reliance on a small number of studies to generate global estimates, (3) assuming that the pandemic results in the complete service disruption for existing interventions, (4) lack of clarity in indicators used and sources of estimates, and (5) failure to account for margins of uncertainty. We argue that there is a need to consider the motivations and consequences of using modelling data as a planning tool for complex issues like GBV, and conclude by suggesting key considerations for policymakers and practitioners in using and commissioning such projections.","Lokot, Michelle; Bhatia, Amiya; Heidari, Shirin; Peterman, Amber",BMJ Glob Health,201,15

The outcomes of these strategies were analysed in terms of their effectiveness in detecting malaria infections for the period from 2017 to 2019. METHODS: Comparisons were made between the surveillance methods and between years, based on data obtained from the national malaria database and individual case reports of malaria patients. The number of blood smears examined microscopically was used as the measure of the volume of tests conducted. The yield from each case detection method was calculated as the proportion of blood smears which were positive for malaria. Within RACD and PACD, the yield of sub categories of travel cohorts and spatial cohorts was ascertained for 2019. RESULTS: A total of 158 malaria cases were reported in 2017–2019. During this period between 666,325 and 725,149 blood smears were examined annually. PCD detected 95.6 %, with a yield of 16.1 cases per 100,000 blood smears examined. RACD and PACD produced a yield of 11.2 and 0.3, respectively. The yield of screening the sub category of travel cohorts was very high for RACD and PACD being 806.5 and 44.9 malaria cases per 100,000 smears, respectively. Despite over half of the blood smears examined being obtained by screening spatial cohorts within RACD and PACD, the yield of both was zero over all three years. CONCLUSIONS: The PCD arm of case surveillance is the most effective and, therefore, has to continue and be further strengthened as the mainstay of malaria surveillance. Focus on travel cohorts within RACD and PACD should be even greater. Screening of spatial cohorts, on a routine basis and solely because people are resident in previously malarious areas, may be wasteful, except in situations where the risk of local transmission is very high, or is imminent. These findings may apply more broadly to most countries in the post-elimination phase.","Gunasekera, W. M. Kumudunayana T. de A.

Study Design: A systematic literature search of MEDLINE, Ovid, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, and Cochrane Library was performed on July 17, 2020 (PROSPERO CRD42020203475). Two additional eligible articles published on or before September 12, 2020 were included in the analysis. Two independent reviewers identified publications that directly compared outcomes among pregnant individuals with positive versus negative SARS-CoV-2 tests. We excluded publications with fewer than twenty gravid individuals in either cohort, review articles, or no data on primary outcomes (intrauterine fetal demise [IUFD] and neonatal death). Study effects were reported as odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Result(s): Of the 911 abstracts identified, 4 studies met inclusion criteria. Among these studies, 3553 individuals who delivered were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 14.8% (527) were positive. IUFD and neonatal death occurred at similar rates between the two groups (Table 1). Maternal outcomes including cesarean delivery and maternal death did not significantly differ between groups. However, rates of preterm birth, postpartum fever, maternal respiratory support, and maternal ICU admission were significantly greater in the SARS-CoV-2-positive group (Table 2). Conclusion(s): Current literature supports no observed difference in rates of IUFD, neonatal death, or maternal death between individuals with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection.
