6634,Amiodarone-Induced Pulmonary Toxicity—A Fatal Case Report and Literature Review,2013-02-10,"OBJECTIVE: The therapeutic potential of simvastatin as an anti-inflammatory agent was explored by investigating its effect on the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response in rat pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (RPMVECs). METHODS: RPMVECs were isolated and the mRNA and protein levels of different toll-like receptors (TLR) were assessed by qRT-PCR and western blotting. The LPS-induced expressions of TLR4, TNF-α and iNOS were analyzed in RPMVECs treated with different concentrations of simvastatin for different times. NF-κB activation was examined by immuofluroscence, luciferase reporter assay and western blotting. RESULTS: TLR4 is abundantly expressed in RPMVECs, and its expression is induced by LPS stimulation. Simvastatin inhibited LPS-induced TLR4 expression at the mRNA and protein levels in a time-dependent manner (p<0.01), and alleviated inflammation in RPMVECs by inhibiting the release of inflammatory factors such as TNF-α and iNOS. Further study indicated that simvastatin significantly attenuated NF-κB activity by inhibiting the degradation of IκB-α. Pretreatment with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and knock-down of TLR4 expression by RNA interference down-regulated the LPS-induced inflammatory response in RPMVECs. CONCLUSION: Simvastatin inhibits the LPS-induced inflammatory response in RPMVECs by down-regulating TLR4 expression, suggesting its role as a potential inhibitor of LPS-induced inflammation","Li, Yi; Ding, Jian-yong; Ge, Biao-xue; Miao, Chang-hong",Cent Eur J Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7101868/,546

Through social network and graph theory lenses, this study explore Twitter data shortly after the announcement of the National Health Insurance (NHI) Bill to the South African parliament. An instrumental, single case study design and SNA secured contextual and timely Twitter interchanges of 4 112 tweets of the hashtag “NHI”. Given the growing call for the comprehension of social media network interactions in different contexts, this paper use the underutilized tool for social media analytics, ‘Network Overview, Discovery and Exploration for Excel Pro’ (NodeXL Pro) to extract and visually present knowledge from pairwise relations between actors in the #NHI social media network. The findings explain the data dispersion and network structure of the #NHI case. The results clearly identifies the influencers – mostly the South African government, specific Twitter users and gatekeepers in the announcement of a highly controversial healthcare bill that will affect all South African citizens. The paper contributes theoretically by adding graph theory to the social media research field and to a less studied social media research cluster, namely social media during critical events.

53763,Covid 19 in women’s health - volume 73 multiple choice questions,2021-06-02,"Chest pain following a trans-thoracic biopsy often has multiple etiologies, especially in patients with lymphomas. Pathological neuronal mechanisms integrate with an overproduction of IL-6, TNF-α, IL1-β by macrophages and monocytes, which amplifies inflammation and pain. In consideration of this complex pathogenesis, international guidelines recommend diversified analgesia protocols: thoracic epidural, paravertebral block, and systemic administration of opioids. This study reports an attempt to reduce chest pain and prevent chronic pain in 51 patients undergoing trans-thoracic biopsy for mediastinal lymphoma. The entity of pain, measured 72nd hour after biopsy by the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), was compared with that seen at a 6th month checkpoint in 46 patients. The pain decreased in all cases. At the 6th month checkpoint, among 31 opioid-treated patients, none of the 16 patients with NRS < 6 within the 72nd hour post biopsy had developed chronic chest pain, while 8 of the 15 with higher values did (p < 0.01). Of 10 patients undergoing thoracotomy and treated with opioids, eight had a NRS of no more than 2, of which six had no chronic pain. Of the twenty-one patients who underwent VATS biopsy and were treated with opioids, fifteen had NRS no greater than 2, of which ten had no chronic pain. Subgroups of patients biopsied under mediastinotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and treated with thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) or PVB were too small for such analysis.","Sica, Antonello; Casale, Beniamino; Sagnelli, Caterina; Di Dato, Maria Teresa; Rispoli, Marco; Santagata, Mario; Buonavolontà, Pietro; Fiorelli, Alfonso; Vitiello, Paola; Caccavale, Stefano; Creta, Massimiliano; Salzano, Anna Maria; Sagnelli, Evangelista; Saracco, Elisabetta; Gazzerro, Giuseppe; Famiglietti, Vincenzo; Tammaro, Dario; Papa, Alfonso",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8157245/,546

Among the infectious aetiologies, Haemophilus influenzae, an organism known to cause community-acquired pneumonia, has not been reported in association with DAH prior to this case. On the other hand, vaping, an evolving epidemic concern, has been linked to various types of lung injury, including DAH. However, DAH related to vaping is only limited to several case reports. Our case describes H. influenzae pneumonia with DAH in a patient known to have vaped until the night prior to elective lobectomy for lung cancer and developed DAH within 24 hours of hospitalisation. He subsequently recovered with treatment. DAH requires immediate recognition, and healthcare providers need to be aware that neither haemoptysis nor decrease in haemoglobin level is necessarily associated.

69319,Realizing our ultimate opportunity.,2020,"BACKGROUND There is paucity of data regarding the cost-effectiveness of fibrin sealants during liver surgery. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of fibrin sealants following right hemihepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases. METHOD A prospectively maintained database between 2004 and 2013 was reviewed to identify patients who underwent a right hemihepatectomy with and without fibrin sealant application. Perioperative and post-operative outcomes were analysed to assess its cost-effectiveness. RESULTS One hundred and sixty-three right hemihepatectomies were performed, of which 79 were in the fibrin sealant treatment group and 84 were in the no sealant group. No difference was seen between fibrin sealant and no sealant with regard to bile leak (P = 0.366), intra-abdominal collections (P = 0.200) and overall post-operative complications (P = 0.480). Operating costs were significantly cheaper in the no sealant group (P = 0.010). There was no difference seen in median post-operative stay between fibrin sealant versus no treatment (8 versus 9 days, P = 0.327), median total bed cost (£3900 versus £4300, P = 0.400), mean transfusion cost per patient (P = 0.201) and overall cost (£6706.15 versus £6555.80, P = 0.792). CONCLUSION Fibrin sealant application to cut surface during liver surgery confers no cost benefit and their routine use may not be recommended.","Pandanaboyana, Sanjay; Bell, Richard; Shah, Nehal; Lodge, J Peter A; Hidalgo, Ernest; Toogood, Giles J; Prasad, K Raj",ANZ journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/ans.12948; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25641546/,546
70896,Pharmacists on the frontline.,2020,"AIM To examine the change in practice from open to laparoscopic practice in our local trust, a national training colorectal unit. METHODS Retrospective comprehensive review of clinical case notes of all colorectal resections between October 2007 and October 2009. Patients were identified through clinical coding and data were analyzed using SPSS. RESULTS Comparison of 113 open versus 103 laparoscopic colorectal surgeries for various indications and short-term outcomes was made. There was an expected overall increase in the laparoscopic colorectal resections. The mean age was 73 years for open and 68 years for laparoscopic surgeries. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to age, sex, and the American Society of Anaesthesiologists. Of the 103 patients who were initially treated with laparoscopy-assisted colectomy, 12 (11.7%) were shifted to open procedures. Perioperative recovery was faster in the laparoscopic-surgery group than in the open-colectomy group, as reflected by a shorter hospital stay (median, 8 vs. 13 d). The overall complication rate was significantly less in the laparoscopy-assisted colectomy group than in the open-colectomy group (33% vs. 46%, P=0.05). CONCLUSIONS Our local hospital practices support the many benefits of laparoscopic colorectal surgery. Substantial improvements in rates of hospital stay and wound infection were noted, hence shifting our practice safely in a district general hospital.","Moussa, Osama M; Rajaganeshan, Raj; Abouleid, Ayman; Corless, David J; Slavin, John P; Khan, Arif; Hughes, Heather; George, Andrew; Selvasekar, Chelliah R","Surgical laparoscopy, endoscopy & percutaneous techniques",https://doi.org/10.1097/sle.0b013e3182433930; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22318056/,546

103198,Preparing pharmacy for influenza season.,2020,"Beta-l-2',3'-didehydro-2',3'-dideoxy-N(4)-hydroxycytidine (l-Hyd4C) was demonstrated to be an effective and highly selective inhibitor of hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication in HepG2.2.15 cells (50% effective dose [ED(50)] = 0.03 microM; 50% cytotoxic dose [CD(50)] = 2,500 microM). In the present study, we investigated the intracellular pharmacology of tritiated l-Hyd4C in HepG2 cells. l-[(3)H]Hyd4C was shown to be phosphorylated extensively and rapidly to the 5'-mono-, 5'-di-, and 5'-triphosphate derivatives. Other metabolites deriving from a reduction or removal of the NHOH group of l-Hyd4C could not be detected, although both reactions were described as the primary catabolic pathways of the stereoisomer ss-d-N(4)-hydroxycytidine in HepG2 cells. Also, the formation of liponucleotide metabolites, such as the 5'-diphosphocholine derivative of l-Hyd4C, as described for some l-deoxycytidine analogues, seems to be unlikely. After incubation of HepG2 cells with 10 microM l-[(3)H]Hyd4C for 24 h, the 5'-triphosphate accumulated to 19.4 +/- 2.7 pmol/10(6) cells. The predominant peak belonged to 5-diphosphate, with 43.5 +/- 4.3 pmol/10(6) cells. The intracellular half-life of the 5'-triphosphate was estimated to be 29.7 h. This extended half-life probably reflects a generally low affinity of 5'-phosphorylated l-deoxycytidine derivatives for phosphate-degrading enzymes but may additionally be caused by an efficient rephosphorylation of the 5'-diphosphate during a drug-free incubation. The high 5'-triphosphate level and its extended half-life in HepG2 cells are consistent with the potent antiviral activity of l-Hyd4C.","Matthes, E; Bünger, H",Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy,https://doi.org/10.1128/aac.01176-09; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19917760/,546

In this study, we identify gene expression patterns associated with three distinct phases (Infiltrating, Early Inflammatory, Late Inflammatory) in the influenza A virus response of recruited alveolar macrophages. In the Early Inflammatory phase, recruited macrophages begin expressing pro-inflammatory genes, driving cytokine-mediated lung damage and contributing to the morbidity observed in influenza-infected wild-type mice. In mice lacking vimentin (Vim-/-), genes associated with the Early Inflammatory phase are suppressed, while the expression of the Infiltrating Phase genes is maintained, which is associated with protection from influenza-induced injury. Using a bone-marrow chimera mouse model, we validate that Vim-/- recruited alveolar macrophages are sufficient to confer protection from influenza-induced mortality.

169345,Online facility service leasing inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"Mounting evidence suggests that solids are a reliable matrix for SARS-CoV-2 detection in wastewater, yet studies comparing solids-based methods and common concentration methods using the liquid fraction remain limited. In this study, we developed and optimized a method for SARS-CoV-2 detection in wastewater using moderate-speed centrifuged solids and evaluated it against an ultrafiltration reference method. SARS-CoV-2 was quantified in samples from 12 wastewater treatment plants from Alberta, Canada, using RT-qPCR targeting the N2 and E genes. PCR inhibition was examined by spiking salmon DNA. The effects of using different amounts of solids, adjusting the sample pH to 9.6–10, and modifying the elution volume at the final step of RNA extraction were evaluated. SARS-CoV-2 detection rate in solids from 20 mL of wastewater showed no statistically significant difference compared to the ultrafiltration method (97/139 versus 90/139, p = 0.26, McNemar’s mid-p test). The optimized wastewater solids-based method had a significantly lower rate of samples with PCR inhibition versus ultrafiltration (3% versus 9.5%, p = 0.014, Chi-square test). Our optimized moderate-speed centrifuged solids-based method had similar sensitivity when compared to the ultrafiltration reference method but had the added advantages of lower costs, fewer processing steps, and a shorter turnaround time.","Hasing, Maria Yu Jiaao Qiu Yuanyuan Maal-Bared Rasha Bhavanam Sudha Lee Bonita Hrudey Steve Pang Xiaoli",Water,https://doi.org/10.3390/w13162166,546

The U.S. election process culminating in the official proclamation of Joe Biden as president has led to an increase in the public’s distrust of politics and its leaders, as public opinion polls show. In this context, the change in the electorate’s attitude towards Donald Trump, throughout the legislature and especially after the elections, stands out. So, the objective of this research was to determine, through the measurement of surveys, the views of the electorate on the behavior of the Republican candidate and the possible causes that determine the loss of confidence in his speeches and comments. (2) The methodology, a comparative quantitative-qualitative approach, analyzed the responses collected by Pew Research waves 78 and 80 (2020 and 2021). Specifically, the surveys analyzed were 11,818 U.S. adults in the case of the American Trends Panel 2020 and 5360 in the case of the same panel for 2021. (3) Results showed the change of position of the electorate, especially Republicans, in the face of the policy of delegitimization of the process and Trump’s populist messages on Twitter. (4) Conclusions pointed in two directions: society has decided not to trust Trump, while at the same time showing distrust about the correct management of the electoral ballot.","Pérez-Curiel, Concha Domínguez-García Ricardo Jiménez-Marín Gloria",Journalism and Media,https://doi.org/10.3390/journalmedia2030020,546

Little efforts have been made on engaging students in computational development after programming trainings. An emerging need is to establish subjects of bioinformatics and programming languages in genetics and molecular biology graduate programs, when students in these degree programs are immersed in a sea of genomic and transcriptomic data, which demands proficient computational treatment. I report an empirical guideline to introduce programming languages and recommend Python as first language for graduate programs in which students were from genetics and molecular biology backgrounds. Including the development of programming solutions related to graduate students' research activities may improve programming skills and better engagement. These results suggest that the applied approach leads to enhanced learning of introductory to autonomy in highly advanced programming concepts by graduate students.

Anti-inflammatory drugs and steroids recommended for immunostimulatory and as immunosuppressors according to the prevailing condition of infection. Several phytomedicines evaluated for their efficiency to control the pandemic. Another natural system to control viruses is the probiotic organisms, proven for their ability to competitively inhibit entry and establishment of viral pathogens in the host. Administration of probiotics during the primary stage of viral infection improves the host immunity and prevents the increase in viral load and in later stages, regulates the host immunity when host inununoregulation disrupted by viral antigen.

The knowledge of the 3D structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins can facilitate the development of therapeutic and diagnostic molecules. Specifically, comparative analyses of the structures of SARS-CoV-2 proteins and homologous proteins from previously characterized viruses, such as SARS-CoV, can reveal the common and/or distinctive traits that underlie the mechanisms of recognition of cell receptors and of molecules of the immune system. Herein, we apply our recently developed energy-based methods for the prediction of antibody-binding epitopes and protein-protein interaction regions to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the Spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV. Our analysis focusses only on the study of the structure of RBDs in isolation, without making use of any previous knowledge of binding properties. Importantly, our results highlight structural and sequence differences among the regions that are predicted to be immunoreactive and bind/elicit antibodies. These results provide a rational basis to the observation that several SARS-CoV RDB-specific monoclonal antibodies fail to appreciably bind the SARS-CoV-2 counterpart. Furthermore, we correctly identify the region of SARS-CoV-2 RBD that is engaged by the cell receptor ACE2 during viral entry into host cells. The data, sequences and structures we present here can be useful for the development of novel therapeutic and diagnostic interventions.","D’Annessa, Ilda; Marchetti, Filippo; Colombo, Giorgio",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.990267,546

The immigration detention system is legally classified as civil, rather than criminal, and therefore non-punitive. Yet it mimics the criminal incarceration system and holds detained individuals in punitive, prison-like conditions. Within immigration detention centers, there are increasing reports and recognition of civil and human rights abuses, including preventable in-custody deaths. In this paper, we propose understanding the health impacts of detention as an accumulation of mental and physical trauma that take place during the entirety of a detained immigrant’s experience, from migration to potential deportation and removal. Further, we explore the social-structural determinants of health as they relate to immigration detention, contextualize these determinants within a human rights framework, and draw parallels to the larger context of US mass incarceration. Realizing the right to health requires addressing these social-structural determinants of health. For the care of immigrant patients to be effective, clinicians and public health professionals must incorporate an awareness of the health risks of the immigration detention system into trauma- and human rights-informed models of care during and after detention.","Saadi, Altaf; De Trinidad Young, Maria-Elena; Patler, Caitlin; Estrada, Jeremias Leonel; Venters, Homer",Health Hum Rights,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7348446/,546
187976,[Meta-analysis of diagnostic tests for the detection of COVID-19].,2021-08-13,"Exocrine cells are epithelial cells in which secretory granules undergo fusion with the apical plasma membrane upon secretagogue stimulation. Several apical plasma membrane proteins have been found in secretory granules in cells from pancreas and salivary glands raising the possibility that incorporation into secretory granules followed by exocytosis of the granules accounts for their insertion into the apical plasma membrane. To test this hypothesis, we have expressed the influenza hemagglutinin (HA) in pancreatic AR42J cells, which make zymogen-like granules upon incubation with dexamethasone. The influenza virus HA is known to be specifically targeted to the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells that lack a regulated pathway and is also known to be excluded from secretory granules in virally-infected pituitary AtT20 cells. Localization of the protein by immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that it accumulated at the plasma membrane of the transfected AR42J cells. HA was not observed in the amylase-rich secretory granules. By immunolabeling of ultrathin cryosections of the transfected cells, HA was also found exclusively on the cell surface, with label over secretory granules not exceeding that seen in control, untransfected cells. In addition, in cell fractionation experiments performed on radiolabeled AR42J cell transformants, HA was not detectable in the secretory granule fractions. These results indicate that HA is not efficiently stored in mature secretory granules and is likely to reach the cell surface via constitutive transport pathways.","Colomer, V; Rindler, M J; Lowe, A W",Journal of cell science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7983185/,546

OBJECTIVES To evaluate whether the pandemic has changed the prenatal care and pregnancy outcome in pregnant women without COVID-19. METHODS The authors conducted a cross-sectional study to describe changes in outpatient clinic visits and to compare the rates of cesarean and instrumental deliveries between two periods of time: March-April 2020 (during the COVID-19 outbreak) with March-April of the preceding year, 2019. RESULTS During the COVID-19 outbreak, visits to obstetric triage, gynecologic triage, high-risk clinic, and ultrasound units decreased by 36.4%, 34.7%, 32.8%, and 18.1%, respectively. The medical center experienced a 17.8% drop in the total number of births (610 births) compared with March and April 2019 (742 births). During the outbreak women were more likely to be nulliparous (33.3% vs. 27.6%, P = 0.02) and present with hypertensive disorders during pregnancy (7.5% vs. 4%, P = 0.005) or gestational diabetes (13% vs. 10%, P = 0.03). More epidural analgesia was used (83.1% vs. 77.1%, P = 0.006). There were more operative vaginal deliveries during the outbreak (16.7% vs. 6.8%, P = 0.01). All other maternal and neonatal outcomes were comparable between the two periods. CONCLUSIONS The medical facility experienced a major decline in all aspects of the routine obstetrics activities during the time of the pandemic. The higher rate of operative vaginal deliveries among nulliparous may be associated with the pandemic effect on the rate of high-risk patients.","Justman, Naftali; Shahak, Gilad; Gutzeit, Ola; Ben Zvi, Dikla; Ginsberg, Yuval; Solt, Ido; Vitner, Dana; Beloosesky, Ron; Weiner, Zeev; Zipori, Yaniv",The Israel Medical Association journal : IMAJ,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33236549/,546

However, nephrologists have fewer opportunities to train in the insertion procedure. We therefore used a PD access simulator to provide training in this operative technique for nephrologists. A PD access simulator developed by Terumo Medical Corporation was used for the training. The simulator uses a mannequin made of acrylic resin. The abdominal wall of a pig is attached to the abdominal area, and a plastic bag represents the abdominal cavity. The simulator enables the surgical procedure to be performed from skin incision to PD catheter insertion. Between October 2011 and December 2013, 3 supervising doctors used the simulator to guide 17 nephrologists with no experience through a PD catheter insertion. One-on-one training was provided in a single 2- or 3-hour session. In a questionnaire survey after the training, trainees gave high marks to the handling of surgical instruments, the environment of the operating room, and the surgical guidance during training. However, the supervising doctors required the ability to respond flexibly, because trainees had individual differences in skills. The PD access simulator might be useful for providing guided training in operative technique for PD catheter insertion.","Sakurada, Tsutomu; Taki, Yasuhiro; Kojima, Shigeki; Oishi, Daisuke; Koitabashi, Kenichiro; Sueki, Shina; Kaneshiro, Nagayuki; Shibagaki, Yugo",Advances in peritoneal dialysis.

195234,[Occupational health in the COVID-19 era].,2021-06-14,"We have used four established lysosomotropic agents, ammonium chloride, amantadine, chloroquine, and methylamine, to monitor the possible interference with an early low-pH-dependent step during adenovirus replication. Two concentrations of each of the different agents were selected; one was essentially nontoxic to uninfected HeLa cells, and the other resulted in some toxicity as measured by trypan blue staining and by interference with cell monolayer establishment, cell proliferation, and radioisotope labelling. It was separately determined that these concentrations displayed pH-raising effects of the same magnitude as higher concentrations previously used in similar studies. Adenovirus uncoating in vivo, normally reaching its maximum within 1 h after infection, was not affected by any of the agents. The subsequent levels of successful nuclear entry events by the parental genomes were monitored by measuring the extent of transcription of an mRNA species coding for the early 72-kDa DNA-binding protein at 10 to 12 h postinfection. In HeLa, KB, HEp-2, and A549 cells, none of the agents were able to affect the levels of early transcription after administration at the point of infection or at 3 h after infection. The cumulative synthesis of the hexon antigen was assessed late in infection, and inhibitory effects were revealed upon administration of 10, 20, and 40 mM ammonium chloride, 10 mM methylamine, and 0.5 mM amantadine, irrespective of the time point of addition. Ammonium chloride at 5 mM reduced the hexon yield by 20% at the most when added within 50 min after infection. Chloroquine at concentrations of 2.5 and 5 microM specifically reduced the hexon yields by 30 to 40% when administered within the first 50 min of infection. On the basis of the lack of effects of nontoxic concentrations of the four agents on the early virus-cell interactive event of uncoating and the early virus-specified transcription, we conclude that a low-pH-dependent step early in the adenovirus replication cycle is not mandatory for a successful infection.","Rodríguez, E; Everitt, E",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8648679/,546

The objective of this study was to estimate the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of HRCT and to find out the relationship between the biomarkers and HRCT findings. This was a cross-sectional descriptive study carried out in the COVID-19 suspected isolation unit of a tertiary hospital from July 2020 to November of 2020. Data were collected from electronic medical record (EMR). Relationship test were done by t-test and one-way-ANOVA test. Total 123 cases were enrolled after matching with selection criterion. Mean age of male was 62.5 years and female 57.7 years. Highest frequency of participants was observed in the 60-69 year age group. According to HRCT% findings 4 groups were made. They are below 25%, 25%-50%, 51%-75% and 76%-100%. The distribution of case among these groups was 15%, 44%, 35% and 6% respectively. The relationship between biomarkers (NLR, D-dimer, Ferritin and CRP) and HRCT% was found significant (p<0.05). In HRCT 92.5% lesion were peripherally placed and 99.2% cases were affected by both lungs. The sensitivity and specificity of HRCT were found 46% and 72.6% respectively with 62% accuracy. Raised biomarkers are significantly related to the more lung involvement in case of COVID-19 suspected pneumonia patients.

The transmission method of the infection is primarily through droplets of various sizes. The SARS-CoV2 virus leads to a severe respiratory illness which in the first place causes the simulation of the acute respiratory syndrome. In order to diagnose of COVID-19 efficiently, samples with infection probability need to be examined through histopathological methods. Survival chances of the infected can remarkably increase if the virus is diagnosed timely by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest. One of the destructive effects of COVID-19 is the formation of ground-glass opacity (GGO) in the lungs which might be regarded to be equivalent to high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE). COVID-19 acts very similarly to SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) which can be inactivated by the chemical compounds of ethanol and sodium hypochlorite. Epidemiologic characteristics of COVID-19 have been indicated by numerous studies; however, there is still a lack of details of pathologic changes in the lung.

Piles of economic losses are encountered due to these diseases. Avian Infectious Bronchitis (IB), caused by Corona virus, is OIE-listed disease and characterized by respiratory, renal and urogenital involvements, causing high mortality. Economic losses are encountered due to loss of productive performance of both egg and meat-type chickens. Variant viruses evolve due to spontaneous mutations and recombinations, causing disease in vaccinated flocks of all ages. Serotyping and genotyping are the common methods of classification of IBV strains. The virus has 4 clusters, grouped into 7 serotypes and the most important strains are Massachusetts, Connecticut, Arkansas, Gray, Holte and Florida along with numerous others, distributed round the globe. Several conventional and molecular diagnostic methods have been described for the diagnosis of IB in chickens. 'All-in/all-out' operations of rearing along with good biosafety measures forms the basis of prevention, whereas vaccination forms the backbone of IB control programme.

It has a negative influence on antibody therapy for viral infection. This effect was first identified in dengue virus and has since also been described for coronavirus. To date, the rapid spread of the newly emerged coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), causing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has affected over 3.8 million people across the globe. The novel coronavirus poses a great challenge and has caused a wave of panic. In this review, antibody-dependent enhancements in dengue virus and two kinds of coronavirus are summarized. Possible solutions for the effects are reported. We also speculate that ADE may exist in SARS-CoV-2.","Wen, Jieqi; Cheng, Yifan; Ling, Rongsong; Dai, Yarong; Huang, Boxuan; Huang, Wenjie; Zhang, Siyan; Jiang, Yizhou",Int J Infect Dis,,546
202497,Emergency remote learning during COVID-19 crisis: Students' engagement,2021,"This renin-angiotensin system (RAS) interpretation is focused on differences in tissue dependence on RAS and on the topological hierarchy that allows mediators to act only on downstream tissues. Dependence of tissues on RAS: Tested by expectation maximization clustering of the RNA human tissue expression (https://biogps.org/). ACE and vasoconstrictive AT1R clustered with the prorenin receptor. ACE2 and dilatory MAS1 clustered with nine RAS-related genes, highly expressed in: Liver; Cardiac_Myocytes; Skeletal_Muscle; Uterus; Kidney; Lung; Small_Intestine; Smooth_Muscle. RAS and stress accumulation: While prorenin is active after binding to its receptor, binding of soluble renin increases its enzymatic activity several times. Increased renin secretion multiplies the overall capacity for producing Ang I, leading to hypertension and increased vascular resistance. Coronavirus infection and comorbidities: Cardiorespiratory failure during infection is linked to the previously altered RAS role in lungs and myocardium. Reduced vasodilation by ACE2 lead to vasoconstriction and suboptimal tissue perfusion patterns.

To demonstrate the usefulness of this pathway as a common target for the development of broad-spectrum antivirals, the inhibitory effect of drug compounds targeting endosomal membrane proteins were investigated. This study entailed direct comparison of drug effectiveness against animal and human pathogenic viruses, namely Ebola (EBOV), African swine fever virus (ASFV), and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). A panel of experimental and FDA-approved compounds targeting calcium channels and PIKfyve at the endosomal membrane caused potent reductions of entry up to 90% in SARS-CoV-2 S-protein pseudotyped retrovirus. Similar inhibition was observed against transduced EBOV glycoprotein pseudovirus and ASFV. SARS-CoV-2 infection was potently inhibited by selective estrogen receptor modulators in cells transduced with pseudovirus, among them Raloxifen inhibited ASFV with very low 50% inhibitory concentration. Finally, the mechanism of the inhibition caused by the latter in ASFV infection was analyzed. Overall, this work shows that cellular proteins related to the endocytic pathway can constitute suitable cellular targets for broad range antiviral compounds.","Galindo, I; Garaigorta, U; Lasala, F; Cuesta-Geijo, M A; Bueno, P; Gil, C; Delgado, R; Gastaminza, P; Alonso, C",Antiviral Res,,546

Given the vulnerability of the already pretreated neurological structures surrounding the nasopharynx, any potential salvage retreatment option bears a significant risk of severe complications that result in high treatment-related morbidity, quality of life deterioration, and even mortality. Yet, with careful patient selection, long-term survival may be achieved after local retreatment in a subgroup of patients with local or regional relapse of nasopharyngeal cancer. Early detection of the recurrence represents the key to therapeutic success, and in the case of early stage disease, several curative treatment options can be offered to the patient, albeit with minimal support in prospective clinical data. In this article, an up-to-date review of published evidence on modern surgical and radiation therapy treatment options is summarized, including currently recommended treatment modifications of both therapeutic approaches during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.","Svajdova, Michaela; Sicak, Marian; Dubinsky, Pavol; Slavik, Marek; Slampa, Pavel; Kazda, Tomas",,,546

To date, few SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cell epitopes have been described. Internal viral proteins are typically more conserved than surface proteins and are often the target of CD8+ T cells. Therefore, we have characterised eight peptides derived from the internal SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid protein predicted to bind HLA-A*02:01, the most common HLA molecule in the global population. We determined not all peptides could form a complex with HLA-A*02:01, and the six crystal structures determined revealed that some peptides adopted a mobile conformation. We therefore provide a molecular understanding of SARS-CoV-2 CD8+ T cell epitopes. Furthermore, we show that there is limited pre-existing CD8+ T cell response towards these epitopes in unexposed individuals. Together, these data show that SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid might not contain potent epitopes restricted to HLA-A*02:01.","Szeto, Christopher; Chatzileontiadou, Demetra S M; Nguyen, Andrea T; Sloane, Hannah; Lobos, Christian A; Jayasinghe, Dhilshan; Halim, Hanim; Smith, Corey; Riboldi-Tunnicliffe, Alan; Grant, Emma J; Gras, Stephanie",iScience,,546

This new mechanism is established by substrate screening, application of functional probes, and computational analysis. AsqJ excises H 2 CO from the heterocyclic ring structure of suitable benzo[1.4]diazepine-2,5-dione substrates to generate quinazolinones. This novel AsqJ catalysis pathway is governed by a single substituent within the complex substrate. This unique substrate-directed reactivity of AsqJ enables the targeted biocatalytic generation of either quinolones or quinazolinones, two alkaloid frameworks of exceptional biomedical relevance.","Einsiedler, Manuel; Jamieson, Cooper S; Maskeri, Mark; Houk, K N; Gulder, Tobias Alexander Marius",Angew. chem; int. ed. engl,,546

The mother underwent cesarean delivery, and amniotic fluid yielded a positive result for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The newborn infant showed early-onset infection with SARS-CoV-2 confirmed on pharyngeal swabs by RT-PCR assay within 24 hours after birth, suggesting vertical transmission. Unfortunately, the mother died 14 days after delivery. We describe the clinical course and outcome of the infant up to 7 months of age.

Background: The government's guidelines affected people with COPD on different levels during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to belonging to a group of particularly vulnerable persons, they had to adapt their health behaviours, in particular physical activity, to recommendations provided in order to prevent negative effects on disease progression. There is little knowledge regarding how this group of patients coped with these challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: To describe the health behaviours and needs people with COPD convey during nursing phone consultations and which nursing interventions have been carried out. METHODS: A document analysis of 50 nursing phone consultations was performed. The data were summarised descriptively and analysed thematically. RESULTS: The main topics were the adaptation of physical activity, the implementation of the recommendations to the individual life situation, the detection of a COVID-19 infection and questions concerning the planning of medical appointments. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic poses additional challenges to the disease management of people with COPD. The increased need for care brought on by the pandemic was able to be met by the knowledge provided in the nursing phone consultations. What remains to be established is what role the consultations play in a sustainable change in behaviour and in dealing with negative emotions.","Hübsch, Christine; Clarenbach, Christian F; Petry, Heidi; Baltes-Wieser, Annina; Schmid-Mohler, Gabriela",Pflege,,546

This module is based on the alloy of Bismuth Telluride Selenide (Bi 2Te 3Se), designed in a press tablet form and characterized under solar energy. Here, both aspects of solar energy i.e., light and heat are utilized for both energy production and water heating. The semitransparent PTEC converts heat energy directly to electrical energy due to the gradient of temperature between two electrodes (top and bottom) of thermoelectric cells. The PTEC is 25% transparent, which can be varied according to the necessity of the utilizer. The X-ray diffraction of material and electric characterization of module i.e., open-circuited voltage (V OC) and Seebeck coefficient were performed. The experimental observations disclose that in the proposed PTEC module with an increment in the average temperature (T Avg) from 34 to 60 °C, results in the rise of V OC∼ 2.4 times. However, by modifying the size of heat-absorbing top electrode and by increasing the temperature gradient through the addition of water coolant under the bottom electrode, an uplift in the champion device results in as increment of V OC∼5.5 times and Seebeck coefficient obtained was −250 μV/ 0C, respectively. Results show that not only the selection of material but also the external modifications in the device highly effective the power efficiency of the devices. The proposed modules can generate electric power from light and utilize the penetrating sunlight inside the room and for the heating of the water which also acts as a coolant. These semitransparent thermoelectric cells can be built-in within windows and roofs of buildings and can potentially contribute to green energy harvesting, in situations where movement is restricted locally or globally.","Fatima, Noshin; Karimov, Khasan S.; Qasuria, Tahseen Amin; Ibrahim, Mohd Adib",J Alloys Compd,,546

METHODS: We performed a population-pharmacokinetic analysis from 104 consecutive COVID-19 hospitalized patients (31 in intensive care units, 73 in medical wards, n=149 samples). Plasma HCQ concentration were measured using high performance liquid chromatography with fluorometric detection. Modelling used Monolix-2019R2. RESULTS: HCQ doses ranged from 200 to 800mg/day administered for 1 to 11days and median HCQ plasma concentration was 151ng/mL. Among the tested covariates, only bodyweight influenced elimination oral clearance (CL) and apparent volume of distribution (Vd). CL/F (F for unknown bioavailability) and Vd/F (relative standard-error, %) estimates were 45.9L/h (21.2) and 6690L (16.1). The derived elimination half-life (t1/2) was 102h. These parameters in COVID-19 differed from those reported in patients with lupus, where CL/F, Vd/F and t1/2 are reported to be 68L/h, 2440 L and 19.5h, respectively.

Overall, 34.7% of students reported a sufficient level of wellbeing, while 33.8% showed low wellbeing and 31.5% very low wellbeing. Wellbeing was significantly higher in postgraduate students compared with undergraduate students. Future anxiety was significantly greater among undergraduate than postgraduate students. Multivariable regression models showed female gender, low subjective social status, negative overall learning experience or reporting COVID-19 having a huge impact on study, were associated with lower wellbeing in the first few months (May-July) of the pandemic. Supporting the health, wellbeing, and learning experiences of all students should be of high priority now and post-pandemic. Strategies specifically targeting female students, and those with low self-reported social status are urgently needed to avoid exacerbating existing disparities.","Dodd, Rachael H; Dadaczynski, Kevin; Okan, Orkan; McCaffery, Kirsten J; Pickles, Kristen",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,546
228551,Teachers' views related the middle school curriculum for distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"In the current era of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world has never been more interested in the process of vaccine development. While researchers across the globe race to find an effective yet safe vaccine to protect populations from the newly emergent SARS-CoV-2 virus, more than one-third of the world has been subjected to either full or partial lockdown measures. With communities having felt the burden of prolonged isolation, finding a safe and efficacious vaccine will yield direct beneficial effects on protecting against COVID-19 morbidity and mortality and help relieve the psychological and economic load on communities living with COVID-19. There is hope that with the extraordinary efforts of scientists a vaccine will become available. However, given the global public health crisis, development of a COVID-19 vaccine will need to be fast tracked through the usual prelicensing development stages and introduced with limited clinical trial data compared with those vaccines that are developed conventionally over more than a decade. In this scenario, surveillance of the vaccine in the real world becomes even more paramount. This responsibility falls to observational researchers who can provide an essential safety net by continuing to monitor the effectiveness and safety of a COVID-19 vaccine after licensing. Postauthorisation observational studies for safety and effectiveness are complementary to prelaunch clinical trials and not a replacement. In this paper, we highlight the importance of postmarketing studies for future newly licensed COVID-19 vaccines and the key epidemiological considerations.","Dhanda, Sandeep; Osborne, Vicki; Lynn, Elizabeth; Shakir, Saad",BMJ Evid.

Confirmed cases in Australia notified up to 7 June 2020: notifications = 7,277; deaths = 102. Over the past fortnightly reporting period, the number of new cases in all jurisdictions continues to decline, or remain very low, and testing rates continue to be high across all jurisdictions, with the positivity rate remaining very low at less than 0.1%. The incidence of COVID-19 has markedly reduced since a peak in mid-March. A combination of early case identification, physical distancing, public health measures and a reduction in international travel have been effective in slowing the spread of disease in Australia. Of the 147 cases notified between 25 May and 7 June, 63% acquired their infection overseas. The proportion of cases locally acquired has dropped substantially to 28% of new cases this period compared with 50% and greater observed since 30 March 2020. Of the cases considered to be locally-acquired over this period, most were associated with contacts of confirmed cases or were associated with known outbreaks. A small proportion of overall cases have experienced severe disease, requiring hospitalisation or intensive care with some fatalities. The crude case fatality rate amongst Australian cases is 1.4%. People who are older and have one or more comorbidities are more likely to experience severe disease. The highest rate of COVID-19 continues to be among people aged 65-79 years. Three-quarters of all cases in this age group have been associated with overseas travel, including several outbreaks linked to cruise ships. The lowest rate of disease is in children under 18, a pattern reflected in international reports. Internationally, as of 7 June 2020, the largest numbers of both cases and deaths have been reported in the United States. Of the confirmed cases reported globally, the case fatality rate is approximately 5.8%. Countries in South America are seeing rapid growth in case numbers, while the United States is seeing a steady decline in its daily new case numbers. Case numbers in Europe remain relatively steady, with several countries in Eastern Europe experiencing rapid growth. In the South East Asia region, India and Bangladesh are seeing accelerating epidemics, compounded by the recovery from Cyclone Amphan. Reported cases are increasing in Africa, although the numbers are much smaller. In the Pacific there are few new cases reported daily.",,,,546

Antimicrobial properties became extremely important during the COVID-19 situation. The main problems faced by antimicrobial finishing are nontoxicity and durability (wash-resistance) of antibacterial activity. Also, it is important to determine whether the antimicrobial finishing changes comfort properties, such as air permeability. This paper deals with the durability of antimicrobial treatment, that is, resistance to washing, and effect on the structural changes that may have influence on the comfort properties, such as permeability to air. Knits of various raw compositions were antimicrobial-treated with the new commercial antimicrobial product, Si Bactericidal (Smart Inovation, Portugal). After the antimicrobial treatment, knitted specimens were washed 50 times and changes in their structural parameters, air permeability, and antimicrobial activity were measured. It was found that the mentioned antimicrobial treatment gives very good antimicrobial activity to the treated fabric and is wash-resistant and long-lasting. Also, it does not change dimensions and permeability to air of the treated fabrics with some exceptions of cotton-based knitted structures. © 2021 Jolita Krisciunaite et al., published by Sciendo 2021.","Krisciunaite, J.; Kalendraite, B.; Ragelienė, L.; Merkelyte, E.; Mikucioniene, D.",Autex Research Journal,,546
241659,COVID-19 and the need for integrative holistic research,2021,"We derived a closed-form solution to the original epidemic equations formulated by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 (1). The complete solution is validated using independently measured mobility data and accurate predictions of COVID-19 case dynamics in multiple countries. It replicates the observed phenomenology, quantitates pandemic dynamics, and provides simple analytical tools for policy makers. Of particular note, it projects that increased social containment measures shorten an epidemic and reduce the ultimate number of cases and deaths. In contrast, the widely used Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) models, based on an approximation to Kermack and McKendricks original equations, project that strong containment measures delay the peak in daily infections, causing a longer epidemic. These projections contradict both the complete solution and the observed phenomenology in COVID-19 pandemic data. The closed-form solution elucidates that the two parameters classically used as constants in approximate SIR models cannot, in fact, be reasonably assumed to be constant in real epidemics. This prima facie failure forces the conclusion that the approximate SIR models should not be used to characterize or manage epidemics. As a replacement to the SIR models, the closed-form solution and the expressions derived from the solution form a complete set of analytical tools that can accurately diagnose the state of an epidemic and provide proper guidance for public health decision makers.","Duclos, Theodore G; Reichert, Thomas A",,,546
242668,A pandemic is dynamic: Viewing COVID-19 through an adaptation lens,2021,"In England, the traditional method of central government redistribution and equalization between locations has been replaced with a greater emphasis on self-sufficiency and entrepreneurism. English local government now faces existential funding questions–a situation that is repeated around the world as the public sector manages the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic. Financialization has figured large in the study of entrepreneurial behaviour. However, in England, legal and procedural constraints have driven authorities to seek revenue funding from other sources, principally seeking additional property-related revenues. In response, this article presents a novel typology of local government funding sources and offers an original analysis of their implications for local authorities’ role. The empirical findings show that the buoyancy and quantum of many funding sources are constrained by prior evolution of location and central–local relations: they are not automatic routes to financialization. Conceptually, these findings reveal that methods of financialization, and the local government funding system within which they typically sit, are as likely to be constrained by the evolution and techniques of governance as they are accelerated by it. International debates around financialization, and wider concerns of how locations develop, would benefit from this account of the often-hidden nature and agency of local government funding systems. © 2021 The Author(s).

242669,A pandemic is dynamic: Viewing COVID-19 through an adaptation lens,2021,"The C2 domain containing protein extended synaptotagmin (E-Syt) plays important roles in both lipid homeostasis and the intracellular signaling; however, its role in physiology remains largely unknown. Here, we show that hypothalamic E-Syt3 plays a critical role in diet-induced obesity (DIO). E-Syt3 is characteristically expressed in the hypothalamic nuclei. Whole-body or proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neuron-specific ablation of E-Syt3 ameliorated DIO and related comorbidities, including glucose intolerance and dyslipidemia. Conversely, overexpression of E-Syt3 in the arcuate nucleus moderately promoted food intake and impaired energy expenditure, leading to increased weight gain. Mechanistically, E-Syt3 ablation led to increased processing of POMC to &#945;-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (&#945;-MSH), increased activities of protein kinase C and activator protein-1, and enhanced expression of prohormone convertases. These findings reveal a previously unappreciated role for hypothalamic E-Syt3 in DIO and related metabolic disorders.","Zhang, Yi; Guan, Yunliang; Pan, Susu; Yan, Lihong; Wang, Ping; Chen, Zhuo; Shen, Qing; Zhao, Faming; Zhang, Xin; Li, Juan; Li, Juxue; Cai, Dongsheng; Zhang, Guo",Proc.

Objectives: To describe the CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia and to share our experience at initial diagnoses. Patients and Methods. Data from 53 patients (31 men, 22 women; mean age, 53 years; age range, 16-83 years) with confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia were collected. Their complete clinical data was reviewed, and their CT features were recorded and analyzed. Results: The average time between onset of illness and the initial CT scan was six days (range, 1-42 days). A total of 399 segments were involved and distributed bilaterally (left lung: 186 segments [46.6%], right lung: 213 segments [53.4%]) and peripherally (38 [71.7%] patients). Multiple lobes (45 [84.9%]) and bilateral lower lobes (left lower lobe: 104 [26.1%], right lower lobe: 107 [26.8%], and total: 211 [52.9%]) were the most commonly involved. Ground-glass opacity with consolidation (24 [45.3%]) and pure ground-glass opacity (28 [52.8%]) were the main findings. The other findings were crazy-paving (14 [26.4%]), bronchiectasis (12 [22.6%]), atelectasis (7 [13.2%]), parenchymal bands (6 [11.3%]), air bronchogram (6 [11.3%]), interlobular thickening (5 [9.4%]), reticular pattern (1 [1.9%]), and pleural effusion (1 [1.9%]). Conclusions: Most COVID-19 pneumonia patients had abnormalities on chest CT images at initial presentation.

257319,Las lecciones que nos deja la pandemia del SARS-CoV-2,2020,"BACKGROUND: Balancing the control of SARS-CoV-2 transmission with the resumption of travel is a global priority. Current recommendations include mitigation measures before, during, and after travel. Pre- and post-travel strategies including symptom monitoring, antigen or nucleic acid amplification testing, and quarantine can be combined in multiple ways considering different trade-offs in feasibility, adherence, effectiveness, cost, and adverse consequences. METHODS: We used a mathematical model to analyze the expected effectiveness of symptom monitoring, testing, and quarantine under different estimates of the infectious period, test-positivity relative to time of infection, and test sensitivity to reduce the risk of transmission from infected travelers during and after travel. RESULTS: If infection occurs 0-7 days prior to travel, immediate isolation following symptom onset prior to or during travel reduces risk of transmission while traveling by 30-35%. Pre-departure testing can further reduce risk, with testing closer to the time of travel being optimal even if test sensitivity is lower than an earlier test. For example, testing on the day of departure can reduce risk while traveling by 44-72%. For transmission risk after travel with infection time up to 7 days prior to arrival at the destination, isolation based on symptom monitoring reduced introduction risk at the destination by 42-56%. A 14-day quarantine after arrival, without symptom monitoring or testing, can reduce post-travel risk by 96-100% on its own. However, a shorter quarantine of 7 days combined with symptom monitoring and a test on day 5-6 after arrival is also effective (97--100%) at reducing introduction risk and is less burdensome, which may improve adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Quarantine is an effective measure to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk from travelers and can be enhanced by the addition of symptom monitoring and testing. Optimal test timing depends on the effectiveness of quarantine: with low adherence or no quarantine, optimal test timing is close to the time of arrival; with effective quarantine, testing a few days later optimizes sensitivity to detect those infected immediately before or while traveling. These measures can complement recommendations such as social distancing, using masks, and hand hygiene, to further reduce risk during and after travel.","Johansson, Michael A; Wolford, Hannah; Paul, Prabasaj; Diaz, Pamela S; Chen, Tai-Ho; Brown, Clive M; Cetron, Martin S; Alvarado-Ramy, Francisco",BMC Med,,546

MATERIALS AND METHODS: All initial chest CTs of patients who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at our emergency department between March 25 and April 25, 2020, were identified (n = 120). Three patient management groups were defined: group 1 (outpatient), group 2 (general ward), and group 3 (intensive care unit [ICU]). Multiple pulmonary and cardiovascular metrics were extracted from the chest CT images using deep learning. Additionally, six laboratory findings indicating inflammation and cellular damage were considered. Differences in CT metrics, laboratory findings, and demographics between the patient management groups were assessed. The potential of these parameters to predict patients' needs for intensive care (yes/no) was analyzed using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curves. Internal and external validity were assessed using 109 independent chest CT scans. RESULTS: While demographic parameters alone (sex and age) were not sufficient to predict ICU management status, both CT metrics alone (including both pulmonary and cardiovascular metrics; area under the curve [AUC] = 0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.79-0.97) and laboratory findings alone (C-reactive protein, lactate dehydrogenase, white blood cell count, and albumin; AUC = 0.86; 95% CI = 0.77-0.94) were good classifiers. Excellent performance was achieved by a combination of demographic parameters, CT metrics, and laboratory findings (AUC = 0.91; 95% CI = 0.85-0.98). Application of a model that combined both pulmonary CT metrics and demographic parameters on a dataset from another hospital indicated its external validity (AUC = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.66-0.88). CONCLUSION: Chest CT of patients with COVID-19 contains valuable information that can be accessed using automated image analysis. These metrics are useful for the prediction of patient management.","Weikert, Thomas; Rapaka, Saikiran; Grbic, Sasa; Re, Thomas; Chaganti, Shikha; Winkel, David J; Anastasopoulos, Constantin; Niemann, Tilo; Wiggli, Benedikt J; Bremerich, Jens; Twerenbold, Raphael; Sommer, Gregor; Comaniciu, Dorin; Sauter, Alexander W",Korean j. radiol,,546

We studied the safety of hydroxychloroquine, alone and in combination with azithromycin, to determine the risk associated with its use in routine care in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Methods: In this multinational, retrospective study, new user cohort studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis aged 18 years or older and initiating hydroxychloroquine were compared with those initiating sulfasalazine and followed up over 30 days, with 16 severe adverse events studied. Self-controlled case series were done to further establish safety in wider populations, and included all users of hydroxychloroquine regardless of rheumatoid arthritis status or indication. Separately, severe adverse events associated with hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin (compared with hydroxychloroquine plus amoxicillin) were studied. Data comprised 14 sources of claims data or electronic medical records from Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the USA. Propensity score stratification and calibration using negative control outcomes were used to address confounding. Cox models were fitted to estimate calibrated hazard ratios (HRs) according to drug use. Estimates were pooled where the I 2 value was less than 0·4. Findings: The study included 956â374 users of hydroxychloroquine, 310â350 users of sulfasalazine, 323â122 users of hydroxychloroquine plus azithromycin, and 351â956 users of hydroxychloroquine plus amoxicillin. No excess risk of severe adverse events was identified when 30-day hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine use were compared. Self-controlled case series confirmed these findings. However, long-term use of hydroxychloroquine appeared to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality (calibrated HR 1·65 [95% CI 1·12-2·44]). Addition of azithromycin appeared to be associated with an increased risk of 30-day cardiovascular mortality (calibrated HR 2·19 [95% CI 1·22-3·95]), chest pain or angina (1·15 [1·05-1·26]), and heart failure (1·22 [1·02-1·45]). Interpretation: Hydroxychloroquine treatment appears to have no increased risk in the short term among patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but in the long term it appears to be associated with excess cardiovascular mortality. The addition of azithromycin increases the risk of heart failure and cardiovascular mortality even in the short term. We call for careful consideration of the benefit-risk trade-off when counselling those on hydroxychloroquine treatment.

264320,Persepsi siswa SMA terhadap pembelajaran daring pada mata pelajaran matematika di masa pandemi COVID-19,2021,"A novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is causing the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Understanding how SARS-CoV-2 enters human cells is a high priority for deciphering its mystery and curbing its spread. A virus surface spike protein mediates SARS-CoV-2 entry into cells. To fulfill its function, SARS-CoV-2 spike binds to its receptor human ACE2 (hACE2) through its receptor-binding domain (RBD) and is proteolytically activated by human proteases. Here we investigated receptor binding and protease activation of SARS-CoV-2 spike using biochemical and pseudovirus entry assays. Our findings have identified key cell entry mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2. First, SARS-CoV-2 RBD has higher hACE2 binding affinity than SARS-CoV RBD, supporting efficient cell entry. Second, paradoxically, the hACE2 binding affinity of the entire SARS-CoV-2 spike is comparable to or lower than that of SARS-CoV spike, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 RBD, albeit more potent, is less exposed than SARS-CoV RBD. Third, unlike SARS-CoV, cell entry of SARS-CoV-2 is preactivated by proprotein convertase furin, reducing its dependence on target cell proteases for entry. The high hACE2 binding affinity of the RBD, furin preactivation of the spike, and hidden RBD in the spike potentially allow SARS-CoV-2 to maintain efficient cell entry while evading immune surveillance. These features may contribute to the wide spread of the virus. Successful intervention strategies must target both the potency of SARS-CoV-2 and its evasiveness.","Shang, Jian; Wan, Yushun; Luo, Chuming; Ye, Gang; Geng, Qibin; Auerbach, Ashley; Li, Fang",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,546

OBJECTIVES: We identified risk factors associated with increased risk of hospitalisation, intensive care unit (ICU) admission and mortality in inner North East London (NEL) during the first UK COVID-19 wave. METHODS: Multivariate logistic regression analysis on linked primary and secondary care data from people aged 16 or older with confirmed COVID-19 infection between 01/02/2020 and 30/06/2020 determined odds ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) and P-values for the association between demographic, deprivation and clinical factors with COVID-19 hospitalisation, ICU admission and mortality. RESULTS: Over the study period, 1781 people were diagnosed with COVID-19, of whom 1195 (67%) were hospitalised, 152 (9%) admitted to ICU and 400 (23%) died. Results confirm previously identified risk factors: being male, or of Black or Asian ethnicity, or aged over 50. Obesity, type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) increased the risk of hospitalisation. Obesity increased the risk of being admitted to ICU. Underlying CKD, stroke and dementia increased the risk of death. Having learning disabilities was strongly associated with increased risk of death (OR = 4.75, 95% CI = [1.91, 11.84], P = .001). Having three or four co-morbidities increased the risk of hospitalisation (OR = 2.34, 95% CI = [1.55, 3.54], P < .001; OR = 2.40, 95% CI = [1.55, 3.73], P < .001 respectively) and death (OR = 2.61, 95% CI = [1.59, 4.28], P < .001; OR = 4.07, 95% CI = [2.48, 6.69], P < .001 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: We confirm that age, sex, ethnicity, obesity, CKD and diabetes are important determinants of risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation or death. For the first time, we also identify people with learning disabilities and multi-morbidity as additional patient cohorts that need to be actively protected during COVID-19 waves.","Cummins, Lisa; Ebyarimpa, Irene; Cheetham, Nathan; Tzortziou Brown, Victoria; Brennan, Katie; Panovska-Griffiths, Jasmina",Influenza other respir. viruses,,546

314391,Fenomena COVID-19: Dampak Globalisasi Dan Revitalisasi Multilateralisme,2020,"BACKGROUND: Often promoted as a way to address increasing demands, improve patient accessibility, and improve overall efficiency, electronic consultations are becoming increasingly common in primary care, particularly in light of the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, despite their increasing use, a theoretically informed understanding of the factors that support and inhibit their effective implementation is severely limited. OBJECTIVE: With this scoping review, we sought to identify the factors that support and inhibit the implementation of electronic consultations in primary care. METHODS: In total, 5 electronic databases (PubMed, Medline, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycINFO) were systematically searched for studies published in 2009-2019 that explored the impact and/or implementation of electronic consultations in primary care. Database searches were supplemented by reference list and grey literature searches. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis and synthesized using Normalization Process Theory (NPT). RESULTS: In total, 227 articles were initially identified and 13 were included in this review. The main factors found to hinder implementation included awareness and expectations; low levels of engagement; perceived suitability for all patient groups, conditions, and demographics; cost; and other contextual factors. Reports of information technology reliability and clinical workload duplication (as opposed to reduction) also appeared detrimental. Conversely, the development of protocols and guidance; patient and staff education; strategic marketing; and patient and public involvement were all identified as beneficial in facilitating electronic consultation implementation. CONCLUSIONS: This review highlights the need for proactive engagement with patients and staff to facilitate understanding and awareness, process optimization, and delivery of coherent training and education that maximizes impact and success. Although the necessity to use online methods during the COVID-19 pandemic may have accelerated awareness, concerns over workload duplication and inequality of access may remain. Future research should explore health inequalities in electronic consultations and their economic impacts from multiple perspectives (eg, patient, professional, and commissioner) to determine their potential value. Further work to identify the role of meaningful patient involvement in digital innovation, implementation, and evaluation is also required following the rapid digitization of health and social care.","Baines, Rebecca; Tredinnick-Rowe, John; Jones, Ray; Chatterjee, Arunangsu",J Med Internet Res,,546

Therefore, an accurate assessment of the risk of airway obstruction in patients with COPD has become vitally important. Although the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD), the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS), and the Japanese Respiratory Society (JRS) provide the criteria by which to diagnose COPD, many studies suggest that it is in fact underdiagnosed. Its prevalence increases, while the impact of COPD-related systemic comorbidities is also increasingly recognized in clinical aspects of COPD. Although a recent report suggests that spirometry should not be used to screen for airflow limitation in individuals without respiratory symptoms, the early detection of COPD in patients with no, or few, symptoms is an opportunity to provide appropriate management based on COPD guidelines. Clinical advances have been made in pharmacotherapeutic approaches to COPD. This article provides a current understanding of the importance of an appropriate diagnosis in the real-world management of COPD.","Hashimoto, Naozumi; Wakahara, Keiko; Sakamoto, Koji",Diagnostics (Basel),,546

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Based on data from the German Diabetes Prospective Follow-up Registry (DPV), we compared data from 715 children, adolescents, and young adults, newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany between 1 March and 30 June 2020, with data from 5,428 children, adolescents, and young adults of the same periods from 2011 to 2019. Adjusted differences and relative risks (RRs) of negative ß-cell autoantibody test results and diabetic ketoacidosis were estimated using multivariable log-binomial regression analysis. An upper noninferiority test (margin 1%) was applied to evaluate whether the autoantibody-negativity rate in 2020 was not higher than that in 2011 to 2019. RESULTS: The estimated frequencies of autoantibody negativity in 2020 and 2011-2019 were 6.6% (95% CI 5.1-8.4) and 7.2% (95% CI 6.5-8.0), respectively, with an absolute difference of -0.68% (90% CI -2.07 to 0.71; P upper noninferiority = 0.023). The increase of the estimated frequency of diabetic ketoacidosis during the COVID-19 pandemic was similar between autoantibody-negative and -positive type 1 diabetes (adjusted RRs 1.28 [95% CI 0.80-2.05] and 1.57 [1.41-1.75], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study found no evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic leads to a significantly increased number of new cases with autoantibody-negative type 1 diabetes in children, adolescents, and young adults.

321108,COVID-19 is a moderating variable with its own moderating factors,2021,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 can induce an immune impairment and dysregulation, finally resulting in the massive release of inflammatory mediators (cytokine storm), strongly contributing to the pulmonary and systemic manifestations in severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). As a consequence, different drugs active on the immune system have been proposed for the treatment of the disease in adults. ROLE OF THE ANTI-RHEUMATIC AGENTS IN CHILDREN: Children are more likely to develop a mild disease course, as the severe form of COVID-19 is identified in less than 5% of the pediatric patients. Moreover, in children a peculiar disease phenotype, defined as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is observed, representing the most severe expression of the inflammatory dysregulation caused by SARS-CoV-2. The limited experience with the severe pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C does not allow conclusions about the role of the immune pharmacological approach, and therefore the treatment of these conditions represents a considerable clinical challenge. The use of chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and colchicine in the early disease stages is not sufficiently supported by evidence, and there is an increasing interest in the role of biologic agents, including anti-IL-1 and anti-IL-6 agents, in the prevention and treatment of the severe manifestations of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: The therapeutic approach to pediatric COVID-19 is multidisciplinary, and anti-rheumatic agents have a prominent role in severe disease. This paper reviews the rationale for the use of anti-rheumatic agents in pediatric COVID-19 and MIS-C and the clinical experience with the single drugs. Finally, the areas of potential improvement in the use of anti-rheumatic agents, including the optimization of the drug choice and the timing of administration, are discussed.","Costagliola, Giorgio; Spada, Erika; Consolini, Rita",Pediatr Rheumatol Online J,,546

BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the COVID-19 crisis has shown a negative impact on public mental health. Mobile health has the potential to help address the psychological needs of existing and new patients during the pandemic and beyond. METHOD: Downloads data of 16 widely used apps were analyzed. The quality of apps was reviewed using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS) framework. Correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the relationship between app quality and app popularity. RESULTS: Among the 16 apps, 10 were meditational in nature, 13 showed increased downloads, with 11 apps showing above 10% increase in the downloads after the pandemic started. The popular apps were satisfactory in terms of functionality and esthetics but lacked clinical grounding and evidence base. There exists a gap between app quality and app popularity. CONCLUSION: This study provided evidence for increased downloads of mental mHealth apps (primarily meditation apps) during the COVID-19 pandemic but revealed several gaps and opportunities to address deficiencies in evidence-based design, usability and effective assessment, and integration into current workflows. APPLICATION: The COVID-19 pandemic is a potential turning point for mHealth applications for mental health care. Whereas the evidence suggests a need for alternative delivery of care, human factors and ergonomics methods should be utilized to ensure these tools are user-centered, easy to use, evidence-based, well-integrated with professional care, and used sustainably.","Wang, Xiaomei; Markert, Carl; Sasangohar, Farzan",Hum Factors,,546

324637,New security feature for patient management software,2020,"COVID-19 is a global pandemic currently in an acute phase of rapid expansion. While public health measures remain the most effective protection strategy at this stage, when the peak passes, it will leave in its wake important health problems. Historically, very few viruses have ever been eradicated. Instead, the virus may persist in communities causing recurrent local outbreaks of the acute infection as well as several chronic diseases that may arise from the presence of a ""suppressed"" virus or as a consequence of the initial exposure. An ideal solution would be an anti-viral medication that (i) targets multiple stages of the viral lifecycle, (ii) is insensitive to frequent changes of viral phenotype due to mutagenesis, (iii) has broad spectrum, (iv) is safe and (v) also targets co-morbidities of the infection. In this Perspective we discuss a therapeutic approach that owns these attributes, namely ""lipid raft therapy."" Lipid raft therapy is an approach aimed at reducing the abundance and structural modifications of host lipid rafts or at targeted delivery of therapeutics to the rafts. Lipid rafts are the sites of the initial binding, activation, internalization and cell-to-cell transmission of SARS-CoV-2. They also are key regulators of immune and inflammatory responses, dysregulation of which is characteristic to COVID-19 infection. Lipid raft therapy was successful in targeting many viral infections and inflammatory disorders, and can potentially be highly effective for treatment of COVID-19.","Sviridov, Dmitri; Miller, Yury I; Ballout, Rami A; Remaley, Alan T; Bukrinsky, Michael",Front Immunol,,546

Its physiopathology remains unknown, and there is no consensus on optimal management. The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of electromagnetic-focused extracorporeal shockwave treatment (F-ESWT) in patients with GTPS. METHODS: This multicenter clinical trial included 103 patients with chronic GTPS randomly assigned to the treatment group, consisting of electromagnetic F-ESWT and a specific exercise protocol, or the control group, receiving sham F-ESWT and the same exercise protocol. Both groups were treated with 3 weekly sessions; the F-ESWT group received an energy flux density of 0.20 mJ/mm, whereas the control group received 0.01 mJ/mm. Patients were assessed at baseline and 1, 2, 3, and 6 months after treatment. A visual analogue scale (VAS) score for pain at 2 months was the primary outcome. The Harris hip score (HHS), Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS), EuroQoL-5 Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D), and Roles and Maudsley score were used as secondary outcomes. Complications were recorded. RESULTS: The mean VAS score decreased from 6.3 at baseline in both groups to 2.0 in the F-ESWT group versus 4.7 in the control group at 2 months; the 2-month score differed significantly between groups (p < 0.001). All secondary outcomes at all follow-up intervals were significantly better in the F-ESWT group, except for the LEFS score at 1 month after treatment (p = 0.25). No complications were observed. CONCLUSIONS: F-ESWT in association with a specific exercise program is safe and effective for GTPS, with a success rate of 86.8% at 2 months after treatment, which was maintained until the end of follow-up.

The hypothesis of the study was the assumption about the influence of hardness on the ability of students to cope with the challenge of complexity, the negative relationship of its characteristics with the index of insomnia and anxiety, as well as positive ones with the characteristics of life-meaning orientations and tolerance to uncertainty. The study show that level of psychological hardness can predict risk of insomnia and feeling of anxiety. The article demonstrate that psychological hardiness is connected with tolerance to the uncertainty. The practical significance is determined by the substantiation of indicators of potential risk and directions of development of resources for coping with the challenge of complexity in the student period.

However, data regarding natriuretic peptides are scarce. N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) reflects haemodynamic stress and has proven useful for risk stratification in heart failure (HF) and other conditions such as pulmonary embolism and pneumonia. We aimed to adequately characterize NT-proBNP concentrations using a large cohort of patients with COVID-19, and to investigate its association with prognosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: Consecutive patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection and available NT-proBNP determinations, from March 1st to April 20th, 2020 who completed at least 1-month follow-up or died, were studied. Of 3080 screened patients, a total of 396 (mean age 71.8 ± 14.6 years, 61.1% male) fulfilled all the selection criteria and were finally included, with a median follow-up of 53 (18-62) days. Of those, 192 (48.5%) presented NT-proBNP levels above the recommended cut-off for the identification of HF. However, only 47 fulfilled the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of HF. Patients with higher NT-proBNP during admission experienced more frequent bleeding, arrhythmias and HF decompensations. NT-proBNP was associated with mortality both in the whole study population and after excluding patients with HF. A multivariable Cox model confirmed that NT-proBNP was independently associated with mortality after adjusting for all relevant confounders (hazard ratio 1.28, 95% confidence interval 1.13-1.44, per logarithmic unit). CONCLUSION: NT-proBNP is frequently elevated in COVID-19. It is strongly and independently associated with mortality after adjusting for relevant confounders, including chronic HF and acute HF. Therefore, its use may improve early prognostic stratification in this condition.","Caro-Codón, Juan; Rey, Juan R; Buño, Antonio; Iniesta, Angel M; Rosillo, Sandra O; Castrejon-Castrejon, Sergio; Rodriguez-Sotelo, Laura; Martinez, Luis A; Marco, Irene; Merino, Carlos; Martin-Polo, Lorena; Garcia-Veas, Jose M; Martinez-Cossiani, Marcel; Gonzalez-Valle, Luis; Herrero, Alicia; López-de-Sa, Esteban; Merino, Jose L",Eur. j. heart fail,,546

Upon evaporation, the molecules partially cleave and form metallo-organic dimers while single molecules are very scarce, as confirmed by simulations. By applying voltage pulses to the different structures under similar conditions, we observe that only one type of dimer can be controllably driven on the surface, which has the lowest dipole moment of all investigated structures. Experiments under different bias and tip height conditions reveal that the electric field is the main driving force of the directed motion.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: All consecutive patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and hospitalized in two COVID Centers were enrolled. All patients performed blood gas analysis and lung ultrasound (LUS) at admission. The LUS acquisition was based on standard sequence of 14 peculiar anatomic landmarks with a score between 0-3 based on impairment of LUS picture. Total score was computed with their sum with a total score ranging 0 to 42, according to Soldati LUS score. We evaluated the course of hospitalization until either discharge or death, the ventilatory support and the transition in intensive care if needed. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-six patients were included in the final analysis. Most of patients presented moderate-to-severe respiratory failure (FiO2 <20%, PaO2 <60 mmHg) and consequent recommendation to invasive mechanic ventilation (CPAP/NIV/OTI). The median ultrasound thoracic score was 28 (IQR 18-36) and most of patients could be ascertained either in a score 2 (40%) or score 3 pictures (24.4%). The bivariate correlation analysis displayed statistically significant and high positive correlations between the LUS score and the following parameters: ventilation (rho=0.481, p<0.001), lactates (rho=0.464, p<0.001), dyspnea (rho=0.398, p=0.001) mortality (rho=0.410, p=0.001).

348660,Holding the line on COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Given the public health responses to previous respiratory disease pandemics, and in the absence of treatments and vaccines, the mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic relies on population engagement in nonpharmaceutical interventions. This engagement is largely driven by risk perception, anxiety levels, and knowledge, as well as by historical exposure to disease outbreaks, government responses, and cultural factors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare psychobehavioral responses in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Comparable cross-sectional surveys were administered to adults in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom during the early phase of the epidemic in each setting. Explanatory variables included demographics, risk perception, knowledge of COVID-19, anxiety level, and preventive behaviors. Responses were weighted according to census data. Logistic regression models, including effect modification to quantify setting differences, were used to assess the association between the explanatory variables and the adoption of social distancing measures. RESULTS: Data from 3431 complete responses (Hong Kong, 1663; United Kingdom, 1768) were analyzed. Perceived severity of symptoms differed by setting, with weighted percentages of 96.8% for Hong Kong (1621/1663) and 19.9% for the United Kingdom (366/1768). A large proportion of respondents were abnormally or borderline anxious (Hong Kong: 1077/1603, 60.0%; United Kingdom: 812/1768, 46.5%) and regarded direct contact with infected individuals as the transmission route of COVID-19 (Hong Kong: 94.0%-98.5%; United Kingdom: 69.2%-93.5%; all percentages weighted), with Hong Kong identifying additional routes. Hong Kong reported high levels of adoption of various social distancing measures (Hong Kong: 32.6%-93.7%; United Kingdom: 17.6%-59.0%) and mask-wearing (Hong Kong: 98.8% (1647/1663); United Kingdom: 3.1% (53/1768)). The impact of perceived severity of symptoms and perceived ease of transmission of COVID-19 on the adoption of social distancing measures varied by setting. In Hong Kong, these factors had no impact, whereas in the United Kingdom, those who perceived their symptom severity as ""high"" were more likely to adopt social distancing (adjusted odds ratios [aORs] 1.58-3.01), and those who perceived transmission as ""easy"" were prone to adopt both general social distancing (aOR 2.00, 95% CI 1.57-2.55) and contact avoidance (aOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.41-2.30). The impact of anxiety on adopting social distancing did not vary by setting. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that health officials should ascertain baseline levels of risk perception and knowledge in populations, as well as prior sensitization to infectious disease outbreaks, during the development of mitigation strategies. Risk should be communicated through suitable media channels-and trust should be maintained-while early intervention remains the cornerstone of effective outbreak response.","Bowman, Leigh; Kwok, Kin On; Redd, Rozlyn; Yi, Yuanyuan; Ward, Helen; Wei, Wan In; Atchison, Christina; Wong, Samuel Yeung-Shan",J Med Internet Res,,546

350241,A future vaccination campaign against COVID-19 at risk of vaccine hesitancy and politicisation,2020,"Recent epidemiological data report that worldwide more than 53 million people have been infected by SARS-CoV-2, resulting in 1.3 million deaths. The disease has been spreading very rapidly and few months after the identification of the first infected, shortage of hospital resources quickly became a problem. In this work we investigate whether chest X-ray (CXR) can be used as a possible tool for the early identification of patients at risk of severe outcome, like intensive care or death. CXR is a radiological technique that compared to computed tomography (CT) it is simpler, faster, more widespread and it induces lower radiation dose. We present a dataset including data collected from 820 patients by six Italian hospitals in spring 2020 during the first COVID-19 emergency. The dataset includes CXR images, several clinical attributes and clinical outcomes. We investigate the potential of artificial intelligence to predict the prognosis of such patients, distinguishing between severe and mild cases, thus offering a baseline reference for other researchers and practitioners. To this goal, we present three approaches that use features extracted from CXR images, either handcrafted or automatically by convolutional neuronal networks, which are then integrated with the clinical data. Exhaustive evaluation shows promising performance both in 10-fold and leave-one-centre-out cross-validation, implying that clinical data and images have the potential to provide useful information for the management of patients and hospital resources.","Soda, Paolo; D'Amico, Natascha Claudia; Tessadori, Jacopo; Valbusa, Giovanni; Guarrasi, Valerio; Bortolotto, Chandra; Akbar, Muhammad Usman; Sicilia, Rosa; Cordelli, Ermanno; Fazzini, Deborah; Cellina, Michaela; Oliva, Giancarlo; Callea, Giovanni; Panella, Silvia; Cariati, Maurizio; Cozzi, Diletta; Miele, Vittorio; Stellato, Elvira; Carrafiello, Gian Paolo; Castorani, Giulia; Simeone, Annalisa; Preda, Lorenzo; Iannello, Giulio; Bue, Alessio Del; Tedoldi, Fabio; Ali, Marco; Sona, Diego; Papa, Sergio",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.06531v1.pdf,546

However, uncertainty exists regarding effectiveness and safety. MethodsIn the Recovery-Respiratory Support multi-center, three-arm, open-label, adaptive, randomized controlled trial, adult hospitalized patients with acute respiratory failure due to COVID-19, deemed suitable for treatment escalation, were randomly assigned to receive CPAP, HFNO, or conventional oxygen therapy. Comparisons were made between each intervention and conventional oxygen therapy. The primary outcome was a composite of tracheal intubation or mortality within 30-days. ResultsOver 13-months, 1272 participants were randomized and included in the analysis (380 (29.9%) CPAP; 417 (32.8%) HFNO; 475 (37.3%) conventional oxygen therapy). The need for tracheal intubation or mortality within 30-days was lower in the CPAP group (CPAP 137 of 377 participants (36.3%) vs conventional oxygen therapy 158 of 356 participants (44.4%); unadjusted odds ratio 0.72; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.96, P=0.03).

The current study aims to compare factors predicting maternal mental health during the COVID-19 lockdown in China, Italy, and the Netherlands. METHODS: The sample consisted of 900 Dutch, 641 Italian, and 922 Chinese mothers (age M = 36.74, s.d. = 5.58) who completed an online questionnaire during the lockdown. Ten-fold cross-validation models were applied to explore the predictive performance of related factors for maternal mental health, and also to test similarities and differences between the countries. RESULTS: COVID-19-related stress and family conflict are risk factors and resilience is a protective factor in association with maternal mental health in each country. Despite these shared factors, unique best models were identified for each of the three countries. In Italy, maternal age and poor physical health were related to more mental health symptoms, while in the Netherlands maternal high education and unemployment were associated with mental health symptoms. In China, having more than one child, being married, and grandparental support for mothers were important protective factors lowering the risk for mental health symptoms. Moreover, high SES (mother's high education, high family income) and poor physical health were found to relate to high levels of mental health symptoms among Chinese mothers. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are important for the identification of at-risk mothers and the development of mental health promotion programs during COVID-19 and future pandemics.","Guo, Jing; De Carli, Pietro; Lodder, Paul; Bakermans-Kranenburg, Marian J; Riem, Madelon M E",Psychol Med,,546
357176,Studi Persiapan Dan Pelaksanaan Mengajar Guru Agama Hindu Dalam Meningkatkan Prestasi Belajar Siswa Di Smp Negeri 1 Dusun Tengah Dalam Masa Pandemi COVID-19,2020,"N95 masks form a critical part of the personal protective equipment used by frontline health-care workers, and are typically meant for one-time usage. However, the recent COVID pandemic has resulted in a serious shortage of these masks leading to a worldwide effort to develop decontamination and re-use procedures. A major factor contributing to the filtration efficiency of N95 masks is the presence of an intermediate layer of charged polypropylene electret fibers that trap particles through electrostatic or electrophoretic effects. This charge degrades quickly when the mask is used. Moreover, simple decontamination procedures (e.g. use of alcohol) immediately degrade any remaining charge from the polypropylene, thus severely impacting the filtration efficiency post decontamination. In this brief report, we summarize preliminary results on the development of a simple laboratory setup allowing measurement of charge and filtration efficiency in N95 masks. We show how the charge on the mask changes due to decontamination treatments, and correlate with reduced filtration efficiency. Additionally, we propose and show that it is possible to recharge the masks post-decontamination treatment and recover filtration efficiency. Importantly, recharging can be performed using readily available equipment and materials, and so can be employed both in urban and rural settings. We emphasize that because of the current worldwide lockdown, the measurements reported in this report are preliminary, performed with hastily constructed home-built equipment on a small variety of masks available to us. Although we are confident in our results, we encourage groups with special-purpose equipment to redo and verify our experiments.","Hossain, Emroj; Bhadra, Satyanu; Jain, Harsh; Bhattacharya, Arnab; Ghosh, Shankar; Levine, Dov",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13641v1.pdf,546

We compared the presentation characteristics and outcomes of adults with and without HIV who were hospitalized with COVID-19 at 207 centers across the United Kingdom and whose data were prospectively captured by the ISARIC WHO CCP study. METHODS: We used Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox regression to describe the association between HIV status and day-28 mortality, after separate adjustment for sex, ethnicity, age, hospital acquisition of COVID-19 (definite hospital acquisition excluded), presentation date, ten individual comorbidities, and disease severity at presentation (as defined by hypoxia or oxygen therapy). RESULTS: Among 47,592 patients, 122 (0.26%) had confirmed HIV infection and 112/122 (91.8%) had a record of antiretroviral therapy. At presentation, HIV-positive people were younger (median 56 versus 74 years; p<0.001) and had fewer comorbidities, more systemic symptoms and higher lymphocyte counts and C-reactive protein levels. The cumulative day-28 mortality was similar in the HIV-positive vs. HIV-negative groups (26.7% vs. 32.1%; p=0.16), but in those under 60 years of age HIV-positive status was associated with increased mortality (21.3% vs. 9.6%; p<0.001 [log-rank test]). Mortality was higher among people with HIV after adjusting for age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-2.14; p=0.05), and the association persisted after adjusting for the other variables (aHR 1.69; 95% CI 1.15-2.48; p=0.008) and when restricting the analysis to people aged <60 years (aHR 2.87; 95% CI 1.70-4.84; p<0.001).

This study aims to present actions to support workers’ permanence in the hospital context at work in pandemic times. The development of actions was based on the activity ergonomics and, therefore, recommended recognizing actions in real work situations involving workers directly. The interventions covered 14 sectors, involving 140 workers. During the actions, the team recorded the activities in a field diary to document the care provided and prepared reports with the identified demands, which were organized into five categories: i) information and communication management, ii) the establishment, improvement, or continuous monitoring of protocols, iii) hospital workers’ health care, iv) establishment of collective spaces to refresh and align conducts;and v) adequacy of work conditions and processes. The interventions with hospital workers in the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to the exchange of experiences and knowledge between same-sector and inter-sector workers and sharing perspectives regarding work dynamics.

381999,Asean Regional Potentials For Combating COVID-19,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by the 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 virus. This severe acute respiratory syndrome is currently a global health emergency and needs much effort to generate an urgent practical treatment to reduce COVID-19 complications and mortality in humans. Viral infection activates various cellular responses in infected cells, including cellular stress responses such as unfolded protein response (UPR) and autophagy, following the inhibition of mTOR. Both UPR and autophagy mechanisms are involved in cellular and tissue homeostasis, apoptosis, innate immunity modulation, and clearance of pathogens such as viral particles. However, during an evolutionary arms race, viruses gain the ability to subvert autophagy and UPR for their benefit. SARS-CoV-2 can enter host cells through binding to cell surface receptors, including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and neuropilin-1 (NRP1). ACE2 blockage increases autophagy through mTOR inhibition, leading to gastrointestinal complications during SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. NRP1 is also regulated by the mTOR pathway. An increased NRP1 can enhance the susceptibility of immune system dendritic cells (DCs) to SARS-CoV-2 and induce cytokine storm, which is related to high COVID-19 mortality. Therefore, signaling pathways such as mTOR, UPR, and autophagy may be potential therapeutic targets for COVID-19. Hence, extensive investigations are required to confirm these potentials. Since there is currently no specific treatment for COVID-19 infection, we sought to review and discuss the important roles of autophagy, UPR, and mTOR mechanisms in the regulation of cellular responses to coronavirus infection to help identify new antiviral modalities against SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Siri, Morvarid; Dastghaib, Sanaz; Zamani, Mozhdeh; Rahmani-Kukia, Nasim; Geraylow, Kiarash Roustai; Fakher, Shima; Keshvarzi, Fatemeh; Mehrbod, Parvaneh; Ahmadi, Mazaher; Mokarram, Pooneh; Coombs, Kevin M; Ghavami, Saeid",Int. j. mol. sci.

The increase seen in the establishment of new medical training institutions globally has consequently led to a proportionate increase in the sourcing for cadavers. Moreover, the surge in mortality rates following the recent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic with no cure or approved vaccine has been a source of concern for academia, especially on the safety in the usage of cadavers for dissection. Notwithstanding, several countries continue to depend on unclaimed bodies as the primary source for cadavers, regardless of the cause of death.

DESIGN: Outbreak investigation including 4 large-scale point-prevalence surveys. SETTING: Integrated VA healthcare system with 2 facilities and 330 beds. PARTICIPANTS: Index patient and 250 exposed patients and staff. METHODS: We identified exposed patients and staff and classified them as probable and confirmed cases based on symptoms and testing. We performed a field investigation and an assessment of patient and staff interactions to develop probable transmission routes. Infection prevention interventions included droplet and contact precautions, employee quarantine, and universal masking with medical and cloth face masks. We conducted 4 point-prevalence surveys of patient and staff subsets using real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Among 250 potentially exposed patients and staff, 14 confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were identified. Patient roommates and staff with prolonged patient contact were most likely to be infected. The last potential date of transmission from staff to patient was day 22, the day universal masking was implemented. Subsequent point-prevalence surveys in 126 patients and 234 staff identified 0 patient cases and 5 staff cases of COVID-19, without evidence of healthcare-associated transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Universal masking with medical face masks was effective in preventing further spread of SARS-CoV-2 in our facility in conjunction with other traditional infection prevention measures.","Thompson, Eliza R; Williams, Faith S; Giacin, Pat A; Drummond, Shay; Brown, Eric; Nalick, Meredith; Wang, Qian; McDonald, Jay R; Carlson, Abigail L",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,546

397535,Elective cardiac surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic: Proceed or postpone?,2020,"BACKGROUND: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) has relaxed restrictions on methadone treatment in the United States. There is concern that the relaxation may increase fatal overdose rates. This study examines opioid treatment program (OTP) changes to methadone treatment during COVID-19 and changes in fatal methadone-involved overdose rates in Connecticut. METHODS: From July 8th to August 18th, 2020, we conducted a comprehensive state-wide survey of all eight OTPs that dispense methadone in Connecticut to examine programmatic changes during COVID-19. We also analyzed state-level data on confirmed accidental opioid-involved deaths to assess if relaxation of take-home dosing restrictions and in-person attendance requirements correlated with increased methadone-involved fatal overdose rates. RESULTS: OTPs reported implementing multiple changes to methadone treatment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The percent of patients receiving 28-day take-home doses increased from 0.1% to 16.8%, 14-day take-home doses increased from 14.2% to 26.8%, and the percent receiving one or no take-home doses decreased from 37.5% to 9.6%. Monthly or more frequent drug testing decreased from 15% to 4.6% and 75.2% of individual counseling for methadone patients transitioned to telehealth. However, changes to methadone treatment varied considerably by program. OTP providers said restrictions on methadone should be relaxed and increases in take-home dosing as well as telehealth should be continued in non-pandemic situations. Methadone-involved fatalities relative to other opioid-involved fatalities did not increase in Connecticut following changes in OTP practices. CONCLUSIONS: Connecticut OTPs relaxed methadone treatment requirements during COVID-19. Since relaxing restrictions on methadone treatment has not increased fatal overdoses, we recommend that the reductions in-person dosing and attendance requirements implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic should be continued and made permanent.","Brothers, Sarah; Viera, Adam; Heimer, Robert",J Subst Abuse Treat,,546

410941,Pengalaman Calon Guru Sains Dalam Pembelajaran Daring Selama Masa Pandemi COVID-19,2020,"Chronic inflammation is now widely recognized to play important roles in many commonly occurring diseases, including COVID-19. The resolution response to this chronic inflammation is an active process governed by specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs) like the lipid mediators known as lipoxins. The biosynthesis of lipoxins is catalyzed by several lipoxygenases (LOXs) from arachidonic acid. However, the molecular details of the mechanisms involved are not well known yet. In this paper, we have combined molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations to analyze how reticulocyte 15-LOX-1 catalyzes the production of lipoxins from 5(S),15(S)-diHpETE. Our results indicate that the dehydration mechanism from 5(S),15(S)-diHpETE, via the formation of an epoxide, presents huge energy barriers even though it was one of the two a priori synthetic proposals. This result is compatible with the fact that no epoxide has been directly detected as an intermediate in the catalytic formation of lipoxins from 5(S),15(S)-diHpETE. Conversely, the oxygenation of 5(S),15(S)-diHpETE at C14 is feasible because there is an open channel connecting the protein surface with this carbon atom, and the energy barrier for oxygen addition through this channel is small. The analysis of the following steps of this mechanism, leading to the corresponding hydroperoxide at the 15-LOX-1 active site, indicates that the oxygenation mechanism will lead to the formation of lipoxinB4 after the final action of a reductase. In contrast, our calculations are in agreement with experiments that lipoxinA4 cannot derive from 5(S),15(S)-diHpETE by either of the two proposed mechanisms and that 5(S),15(S)-diHETE is not an intermediate of lipoxin biosynthesis catalyzed by 15-LOX-1.","Cruz, Alejandro; González-Lafont, Àngels; Lluch, José M",J. phys. chem.

412564,How pandemics affect tourism: International evidence,2020,"Segmented models are widely used to describe non-stationary sequential data with discrete change points. Their estimation usually requires solving a mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem, where the segmentation is the discrete part and all other model parameters are continuous. A number of estimation algorithms have been developed that are highly specialized for their specific model assumptions. The dependence on non-standard algorithms makes it hard to integrate segmented models in state-of-the-art deep learning architectures that critically depend on gradient-based optimization techniques. In this work, we formulate a relaxed variant of segmented models that enables joint estimation of all model parameters, including the segmentation, with gradient descent. We build on recent advances in learning continuous warping functions and propose a novel family of warping functions based on the two-sided power (TSP) distribution. TSP-based warping functions are differentiable, have simple closed-form expressions, and can represent segmentation functions exactly. Our formulation includes the important class of segmented generalized linear models as a special case, which makes it highly versatile. We use our approach to model the spread of COVID-19 by segmented Poisson regression, perform logistic regression on Fashion-MNIST with artificial concept drift, and demonstrate its capacities for phoneme segmentation.","Scharwachter, Erik; Lennartz, Jonathan; Muller, Emmanuel",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13105v1.pdf,546

418981,GoodWIL placements: How COVID-19 shifts the conversation about unpaid placements,2020,"Staphylococcus aureus is a highly significant infection problem in health care centers, particularly after surgery. It has been shown that nearly 80% of S. aureus infections following surgery are the same as those in the anterior nares of patients, suggesting that the anterior nares is the source of the infection strain. This has led to the use of mupirocin ointment being applied nasally to reduce infections; mupirocin resistance is being observed. This study was undertaken to determine whether gel composed of 5% glycerol monolaurate solubilized in a glycol-based, nonaqueous gel (5% GML gel) could be used as an alternative. In our study, 40 healthy human volunteers swabbed their anterior nares for 3 days with the 5% GML gel. Prior to swabbing and 8 to 12 h after swabbing, S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcal CFU per milliliter were determined by plating the swabs on mannitol salt agar. Fourteen of the volunteers had S. aureus in their nares prior to 5% GML gel treatment, most persons with the organisms present in both nares; five had pure cultures of S. aureus All participants without pure culture of S. aureus were cocolonized with S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. Five of the S. aureus strains produced the superantigens commonly associated with toxic shock syndrome, though none of the participants became ill. For both S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, the 5% GML gel treatment resulted in a 3-log-unit reduction in microorganisms. For S. aureus, the reduction persisted for 2 or 3 days.IMPORTANCE In this microflora study, we show that a 5% glycerol monolaurate nonaqueous gel is safe for use in the anterior nares. The gel was effective in reducing Staphylococcus aureus nasally, a highly significant hospital-associated pathogen. The gel may be a useful alternative or additive to mupirocin ointment for nasal use prior to surgery, noting that 80% of hospital-associated S. aureus infections are due to the same organism found in the nose. This gel also kills all enveloped viruses tested and should be considered for studies to reduce infection and transmission of coronaviruses and influenza viruses.","Schlievert, Patrick M; Peterson, Marnie L",MSphere,,546
420382,The effects of covid-19 in learning: Effective and efficient online learning models of mathematical statistics and real analysis from the students' perspective,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus pandemic has exerted significant impacts on primary care, causing rapid digital transformation, exacerbating social isolation, and disrupting medical student and General Practice [GP] trainee education. Here we report on a medical student telephone initiative set-up by a final year GP trainee (the equivalent of a family medicine resident), which aimed to support patients at high risk and vulnerable to the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 [Covid-19]. In addition, it was hoped the project would mitigate a digital divide, enable proactive anticipatory planning, and provide an active learning environment to compensate for the pandemic's impact on medical education. METHODS: Thirty-three medical students conducted daily telephone conversations with high risk and vulnerable patients as specified by the initial NHSE published lists. They confirmed public health messages, offered details for voluntary support groups, established need for medication delivery, explored levels of digital connectivity, and prompted discussions around end-of-life choices. Students had access to online reflective resources and daily remote debriefing sessions with the GP trainee. A convergent mixed-methods evaluation was subsequently undertaken, using quantitative process and descriptive data and individual qualitative interviews were conducted according to a maximal variation sampling strategy with students, General Practitioners [GPs], and the GP trainee. Inductive thematic analysis was then applied with cross-validation, respondent validation, and rich evidential illustration aiding integrity. RESULTS: Ninety-seven 'high risk' and 781 'vulnerable' calls were made. Individuals were generally aware of public heath information, but some struggled to interpret and apply it within their own lives. Therefore respondents felt students provided additional practical and psychological benefits, particularly with regard to strengthening the links with the community voluntary groups. The project was widely liked by students who reported high levels of skill development and widened awareness, particularly valuing the active learning environment and reflective feedback sessions. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates utilization of medical students as wider assets within the primary health care team, with an initiative that enables support for vulnerable patients whilst promoting active medical education. Ongoing integration of students within 'normal' primary health care roles, such as chronic disease or mental health reviews, could provide similar opportunities for supported active and reflective learning.","Hughes, Tirion; Beard, Eleanor; Bowman, Amelia; Chan, Joyce; Gadsby, Katrina; Hughes, Martha; Humphries, Maya; Johnston, Aaron; King, Georgina; Knock, Megan; Malhi, Kaveeta; Mickute, Gerda; Okpalugo, Ebubechi; Oliver, Madeleine; Perera, Vimukthi; Pickles, Florence; Pollock, Lily; Pullen, Lucienne; Samuels, Ffion; Sexton, Harriet; Shutler, Laura; Smith, Rebecca; Tanner, Pippa; Ladds, Emma",BMC Med Educ,,546

SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: COVID-19 emergency shocked national health systems, subtracting resources from treatment of other diseases. Its impact on surgical oncology is still to elucidate. METHODS: A 56-question survey regarding the oncological surgical activity in Italy during the COVID-19 emergency was sent to referral centers for hepato-bilio-pancreatic, colorectal, esophago-gastric, and sarcoma/soft-tissue tumors. The survey portrays the situation 5 weeks after the first case of secondary transmission in Italy. RESULTS: In total, 54 surgical Units in 36 Hospitals completed the survey (95%). After COVID-19 emergency, 70% of Units had reduction of hospital beds (median -50%) and 76% of surgical activity (median -50%). The number of surgical procedures decreased: 3.8 (interquartile range 2.7-5.4) per week before the emergency versus 2.6 (22-4.4) after (P = 0.036). In Lombardy, the most involved district, the number decreased from 3.9 to 2 procedures per week. The time interval between multidisciplinary discussion and surgery more than doubled: 7 (6-10) versus 3 (3-4) weeks (P &lt; 0.001). Two-third (n = 34) of departments had repeat multidisciplinary discussion of patients. The commonest criteria to prioritize surgery were tumor biology (80%), time interval from neoadjuvant therapy (61%), risk of becoming unresectable (57%), and tumor-related symptoms (52%). Oncological hub-and-spoke program was planned in 29 departments, but was active only in 10 (19%). CONCLUSIONS: This survey showed how surgical oncology suffered remarkable reduction of the activity resulting in doubled waiting-list. The oncological hub-and-spoke program did not work adequately. The reassessment of healthcare systems to better protect the oncological path seems a priority.","Torzilli, Guido; Vigano, Luca; Galvanin, Jacopo; Castoro, Carlo; Quagliuolo, Vittorio; Spinelli, Antonino; Zerbi, Alessandro; Donadon, Matteo; Montorsi, Marco",Ann.

It allows randomness to the infectivity of individuals rather than a constant reproduction number as assumed by standard models. Key epidemiological quantities, such as the distribution of final epidemic size and expected epidemic duration, are derived and estimated based on real data for various regions and countries. The associated time lag of the effect of intervention in each country or region is estimated. Our results are consistent with the incubation time of COVID-19 found by recent medical study. We demonstrate that our model could potentially be a valuable tool in the modeling of COVID-19. More importantly, the proposed model of 2P-DCP could also be used as an important tool in epidemiological modelling as this type of contagion models with very simple structures is adequate to describe the evolution of regional epidemic and worldwide pandemic.","Chen, Zezhun; Dassios, Angelos; Kuan, Valerie; Lim, Jia Wei; Qu, Yan; Surya, Budhi; Zhao, Hongbiao",Results Phys,,546

The occurrence of trans-placental transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains highly debated. Placental positivity for SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in selected cases, but infection or virus-associated disease of fetal tissues or newborns remains to be demonstrated. METHODS: We screened for SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein expression placentas from 101 women who delivered between February 7 and May 15, 2020, including 15 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, 34 tested negative, and 52 not evaluated as they did not meet testing criteria (32), or delivered before COVID-19 pandemic declaration (20). Immunostain for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) was performed in the placentas of all COVID-19 positive women. One placenta resulted positive for the SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins, which was further studied by RNA-in situ hybridization and RT-PCR for S transcripts, and by electron microscopy. A comprehensive immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence analysis of the placental inflammatory infiltrate completed the investigations. FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 S and N proteins were strongly expressed in the placenta of a COVID-19 pregnant woman whose newborn tested positive for viral RNA and developed COVID-19 pneumonia soon after birth. SARS-CoV-2 antigens, RNA and/or particles morphologically consistent with coronavirus were identified in villous syncytiotrophoblast, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, in maternal macrophages, and in Hofbauer cells and fetal intravascular mononuclear cells. The placenta intervillous inflammatory infiltrate consisted of neutrophils and monocyte-macrophages expressing activation markers. Absence of villitis was associated with an increase in the number of Hofbauer cells, which expressed PD-L1. Scattered neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) were identified by immunofluorescence. INTERPRETATION: We provide first-time evidence for maternal-fetal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, likely propagated by circulating virus-infected fetal mononuclear cells. Placenta infection was associated with recruitment of maternal inflammatory cells in the intervillous space, without villitis. PD-L1 expression in syncytiotrophoblast and Hofbaeur cells, together with limited production of NETs, may have prevented immune cell-driven placental damage, ensuring sufficient maternal-fetus nutrient exchanges.","Facchetti, Fabio; Bugatti, Mattia; Drera, Emma; Tripodo, Claudio; Sartori, Enrico; Cancila, Valeria; Papaccio, Marta; Castellani, Roberta; Casola, Stefano; Boniotti, Maria Beatrice; Cavadini, Patrizia; Lavazza, Antonio",EBioMedicine,,546

450892,Working for better health care for tangata whaiora,2020,"INTRODUCTION: International guidelines include early nutritional support (&#8804;48 hour after admission), 20-25 kcal/kg/day, and 1.2-2 g/kg/day protein at the acute phase of critical illness. Recent data challenge the appropriateness of providing standard amounts of calories and protein during acute critical illness. Restricting calorie and protein intakes seemed beneficial, suggesting a role for metabolic pathways such as autophagy, a potential key mechanism in safeguarding cellular integrity, notably in the muscle, during critical illness. However, the optimal calorie and protein supply at the acute phase of severe critical illness remains unknown. NUTRIREA-3 will be the first trial to compare standard calorie and protein feeding complying with guidelines to low-calorie low-protein feeding. We hypothesised that nutritional support with calorie and protein restriction during acute critical illness decreased day 90 mortality and/or dependency on intensive care unit (ICU) management in mechanically ventilated patients receiving vasoactive amine therapy for shock, compared with standard calorie and protein targets. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: NUTRIREA-3 is a randomised, controlled, multicentre, open-label trial comparing two parallel groups of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and vasoactive amine therapy for shock and given early nutritional support according to one of two strategies: early calorie-protein restriction (6 kcal/kg/day-0.2-0.4 g/kg/day) or standard calorie-protein targets (25 kcal/kg/day, 1.0-1.3 g/kg/day) at the acute phase defined as the first 7 days in the ICU. We will include 3044 patients in 61 French ICUs. Two primary end-points will be evaluated: day 90 mortality and time to ICU discharge readiness. The trial will be considered positive if significant between-group differences are found for one or both alternative primary endpoints. Secondary outcomes include hospital-acquired infections and nutritional, clinical and functional outcomes. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The NUTRIREA-3 study has been approved by the appropriate ethics committee. Patients are included after informed consent. Results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals.

453056,Pemanfaatan Diplomasi Publik Oleh Indonesia Dalam Krisis COVID-19,2020,"The emergence of a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), in December 2019 led to a worldwide pandemic with over 170 million confirmed infections and over 3.5 million deaths (as of May 2021). Early studies have shown higher mortality rates from SARS-CoV-2 infection in cancer patients than individuals without cancer. Herein, we review the evidence that the gut microbiota plays a crucial role in health and has been linked to the development of colorectal cancer (CRC). Investigations have shown that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes changes to the gut microbiota, including an overall decline in microbial diversity, enrichment of opportunistic pathogens such as Fusobacterium nucleatum bacteremia, and depletion of beneficial commensals, such as the butyrate-producing bacteria. Further, these changes lead to increased co-lonic inflammation, which leads to gut barrier disruption, expression of genes governing CRC tu-morigenesis, and tumor immunosuppression, thus further exacerbating CRC progression. Addi-tionally, a long-lasting impact of SARS-CoV-2 on gut dysbiosis might result in a greater possibility of new CRC diagnosis or aggravating the condition in those already afflicted. Herein, we review the evidence relating to the current understanding of how infection with SARS-CoV-2 impacts the gut microbiota and the effects this will have on CRC carcinogenesis and progression.","Howell, M.

454628,A nursing future dedicated to diabetes care,2020,"When vaccines are in limited supply, expanding the number of people who receive some vaccine, such as by halving doses or increasing the interval between doses, can reduce disease and mortality compared with concentrating available vaccine doses in a subset of the population. A corollary of such dose-sparing strategies is that the vaccinated individuals may have less protective immunity. Concerns have been raised that expanding the fraction of the population with partial immunity to SARS-CoV-2 could increase selection for vaccine-escape variants, ultimately undermining vaccine effectiveness. We argue that, although this is possible, preliminary evidence instead suggests such strategies should slow the rate of viral escape from vaccine or naturally induced immunity. As long as vaccination provides some protection against escape variants, the corresponding reduction in prevalence and incidence should reduce the rate at which new variants are generated and the speed of adaptation. Because there is little evidence of efficient immune selection of SARS-CoV-2 during typical infections, these population-level effects are likely to dominate vaccine-induced evolution.","Cobey, Sarah; Larremore, Daniel B; Grad, Yonatan H; Lipsitch, Marc",Nat Rev Immunol,,546

It is a highly contagious disease transmitted through direct or indirect contact with infected people or contaminated surfaces, mainly through respiratory droplets, but other routes are being investigated. OBJECTIVE: It is known that coronaviruses (CoVs) can cause a variety of ocular pathologies in animals, including conjunctivitis, anterior uveitis, retinitis, and optic neuritis, many of which are severe. However, there is no evidence of the SARS-CoV-2 presence in the eye tissue of asymptomatic patients, even if the symptomatic incidence is low. This systematic review presents updated literature on this issue. ABBREVIATED DESCRIPTION OF THE STATE OF KNOWLEDGE: COVID-19 has now spread throughout the continents and poses a global threat to public health. The risk of rapidly overloading health care systems and causing substantial mortality worldwide is real. On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced coronavirus as a global pandemic. Several studies described a few cases with initial ocular symptoms followed by systemic symptoms of the disease. SUMMARY: Although the frequency of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection through the eye is low, ocular symptoms are not uncommon in COVID-19. In some cases, eye symptoms may be the first signs of illness. This implies the need for hygienic recommendations and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for medical staff and other services to minimize COVID-19 infection of both health-care workers and patients. A triage for ophthalmic outpatient clinic is mandatory.","Latalska, Malgorzata; Mackiewicz, Jerzy",Ann Agric Environ Med,,546

This case report describes a first experience caring for a patient with COVID-19 who received venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and expands the literature by discussing relevant nursing management and operational considerations. CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 46-year-old man presented to a hospital emergency department with pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, anorexia, and chills. The patient was intubated for pneumonia-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome. DIAGNOSIS: A nasopharyngeal swab specimen was positive for SARS-CoV-2, and chest radiography confirmed a diagnosis of COVID-19 with acute respiratory distress syndrome. INTERVENTIONS: After no improvement with mechanical ventilation and prone positioning, the patient began receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and was transferred to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation center. Frontline critical care nurses played a vital role in coordinating patient care activities, monitoring changes in the patient's condition, and detecting complications early. OUTCOMES: The patient was decannulated on day 15 and extubated on day 17. The patient was successfully discharged home on hospital day 24. CONCLUSION: Caring for a patient with COVID-19 receiving venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation posed unprecedented challenges that required deviations from standards of care to optimize infection control measures and staff safety while providing quality care. This case report may inform, prepare, and guide other critical care nurses who will be caring for similar patients during this pandemic.","Peig, Nestor Neil A; Djen, Erica; Garalza, Marielle; Given, Caroline; Henderson, Jasmine; O039,; Connor, Tara; Serrano, Catherine Puno; Veatch, Adrianna; Rodriguez, Michelle; Murray, Katrine; Miller, Pamela S; Marcarian, Taline",Crit Care Nurse,,546
474943,How COVID-19 is shifting psychological contracts within organizations,2021,"Peripartum emergencies that require intensive medical care represent a major challenge for the interdisciplinary treatment team. Due to physiological changes in pregnant women symptoms can be masked and the initiation of treatment is delayed. Peripartum sepsis has a relatively high incidence. The anti-infective treatment depends on the spectrum of pathogens to be expected. Endocrinological emergencies are rare but can be fulminant and fatal. The development of ketoacidosis is favored by decreased bicarbonate buffer and placental hormones. In the case of thyrotoxicosis, propylthiouracil and thiamazole are available for treatment depending on the stage of gestation. Sheehan's syndrome is an infarction of the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland during a hemorrhage. Due to the loss of production of vital hormones, this can be fatal. The development of pulmonary edema is just as acute. This is favored by physiological changes during pregnancy. The differentiation between hypertensive and hypotensive pulmonary edema is important for the causal treatment.","Fischer, J; Gerresheim, G; Schwemmer, U",Anaesthesist,,546
475753,Working remotely: Innovative allied health placements in response to COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: Data on the impact of biologics and immunomodulators on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related outcomes remain scarce. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether patients taking tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFis) or methotrexate are at increased risk of COVID-19-related outcomes. METHODS: In this large comparative cohort study, real-time searches and analyses were performed on adult patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and were treated with TNFis or methotrexate compared with those who were not treated. The likelihood of hospitalization and mortality were compared between groups with and without propensity score matching for confounding factors. RESULTS: More than 53 million (53,511,836) unique patient records were analyzed, of which 32,076 (0.06%) had a COVID-19-related diagnosis documented starting after January 20, 2020. Two hundred fourteen patients with COVID-19 were identified with recent TNFi or methotrexate exposure compared with 31,862 patients with COVID-19 without TNFi or methotrexate exposure. After propensity matching, the likelihood of hospitalization and mortality were not significantly different between the treatment and nontreatment groups (risk ratio = 0.91 [95% confidence interval, 0.68-1.22], P = .5260 and risk ratio = 0.87 [95% confidence interval, 0.42-1.78], P = .6958, respectively). LIMITATIONS: All TNFis may not behave similarly. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that patients with recent TNFi or methotrexate exposure do not have increased hospitalization or mortality compared with patients with COVID-19 without recent TNFi or methotrexate exposure.","Yousaf, Ahmed; Gayam, Swapna; Feldman, Steve; Zinn, Zachary; Kolodney, Michael",J.

483766,Virtual internships and work-integrated learning in hospitality and tourism in a post-COVID-19 world,2020,"BACKGROUND: Current studies on the COVID-19 depicted a general incubation period distribution and did not examine whether the incubation period distribution varies across patients living in different geographical locations with varying environmental attributes. Profiling the incubation distributions geographically help to determine the appropriate quarantine duration for different regions. METHODS: This retrospective study mainly applied big data analytics and methodology, using the publicly accessible clinical report for patients (n = 543) confirmed as infected in Shenzhen and Hefei, China. Based on 217 patients on whom the incubation period could be identified by the epidemiological method. Statistical and econometric methods were employed to investigate how the incubation distributions varied between infected cases reported in Shenzhen and Hefei. RESULTS: The median incubation period of the COVID-19 for all the 217 infected patients was 8 days (95% CI 7 to 9), while median values were 9 days in Shenzhen and 4 days in Hefei. The incubation period probably has an inverse U-shaped association with the meteorological temperature. The warmer condition in the winter of Shenzhen, average environmental temperature between 10 °C to 15 °C, may decrease viral virulence and result in more extended incubation periods. CONCLUSION: Case studies of the COVID-19 outbreak in Shenzhen and Hefei indicated that the incubation period of COVID-19 had exhibited evident geographical disparities, although the pathological causality between meteorological conditions and incubation period deserves further investigation. Methodologies based on big data released by local public health authorities are applicable for identifying incubation period and relevant epidemiological research.","Xiao, Zuopeng; Guo, Wenbo; Luo, Zhiqiang; Liao, Jianxiang; Wen, Feiqiu; Lin, Yaoyu",Environ Health Prev Med,,546

485163,The impact of the non-essential business closure policy on COVID-19 infection rates,2021,"OBJECTIVE: The use of the prone position to treat patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who are critically ill and mechanically ventilated is well documented. This case series reports the location, severity, and prevalence of focal peripheral nerve injuries involving the upper limb identified in an acute COVID-19 rehabilitation setting. The purpose of this study was to report observations and to explore the challenges in assessing these patients. METHODS: Participants were patients with suspected peripheral nerve injuries following discharge from COVID-19 critical care who were referred to the peripheral nerve injury multidisciplinary team. Data were collected retrospectively on what peripheral neuropathies were observed, with reference to relevant investigation findings and proning history. RESULTS: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom, 256 patients were admitted to COVID-19 critical care of Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham, United Kingdom. From March to June 2020, a total of 114 patients required prone ventilation. In this subgroup, a total of 15 patients were identified with clinical findings of peripheral nerve injuries within the upper limb. In total, 30 anatomical nerve injuries were recorded. The most commonly affected nerve was the ulnar nerve (12/30) followed by the cords of the brachial plexus (10/30). Neuropathic pain and muscle wasting were identified, signifying a high-grade nerve injury. CONCLUSION: Peripheral nerve injuries can be associated with prone positioning on intensive care units, although other mechanisms, such as those of a neuroinflammatory nature, cannot be excluded. IMPACT: Proning-related upper limb peripheral nerve injuries are not discussed widely in the literature and could be an area of further consideration when critical care units review their proning protocols. Physical therapists treating these patients play a key part in the management of this group of patients by optimizing the positioning of patients during proning, making early identification of peripheral nerve injuries, providing rehabilitation interventions, and referring to specialist services if necessary. LAY SUMMARY: During the COVID-19 pandemic, patients who are very ill can be placed for long periods of time on their stomach to improve their chances of survival. The potential consequences of prolonged time in this position are weakness and pain in the arms due to potential nerve damage. There are some recommended treatments to take care of these problems.","Miller, Caroline; O039,; Sullivan, Joel; Jeffrey, Jack; Power, Dominic",Phys. ther,,546

489304,Experience with Panbio™ rapid antigens test device for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes./ Experiencia con los test rápidos de antígenos Panbio™ para la detección del SARS-CoV-2 en centros residenciales,2021,"Objective: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), remains a deadly infectious disease. India contributes to one-third of the global TB burden. However, no studies have been carried out in the Telangana (Hyderabad) population using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Therefore, the current study evaluated the role of RT-PCR as a rapid and non-invasive test to diagnose TB by testing for pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB). Materials and methods: This hospital-based study examined 1670 samples (900 EPTB; 770 PTB) comprising tissue (n = 537), peritoneal fluid (n = 420), sputum (n = 166), bronchial fluid (n = 126), cerebrospinal fluid (n = 145), ascetic fluid (n = 76), sputum pus (n = 78), urine (n = 79), and bronchoalveolar fluid (n = 43) samples. DNA from samples was separated using specific isolation kits and subjected to RT-PCR. Results: In this study, we enrolled 1670 subjects and categorized 54.4% as females and 45.6% as males. The collected samples were categorized as 48.5% of fluid samples, followed by tissue (32.2%), sputum (9.9%), urine (4.7%), and pus-swab (4.6%). RT-PCR analysis revealed that 4.7% patients were positive for Mtb. Our results revealed that 61% of the affected patients were male and 39% were female. Among the specimen types, tissue samples gave the highest proportion of positive results (36.3%). Conclusion: The results showed that RT-PCR should be implemented and given top priority in TB diagnosis to save time and facilitate a definitive diagnosis. Tissue samples are highly recommended to screen the Mtb through the technique RTPCR. Future studies should extend the technique to the global population and exome sequencing analysis should be performed to identify TB risk markers.","Goud, Kalal Iravathy; Kavitha, Matam; Mahalakshmi, Adi; Vempati, Ravi; Alodhayani, Abdulaziz A; Mohammed, Arif A; Khan, Imran Ali",Afr Health Sci,,546
492823,Preservice teachers use of WhatsApp to explain subject content to school children during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: We investigated for change in blood stream infections (BSI) with Enterobacterales, coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS), Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus during the first UK wave of SARS-CoV-2 across five London hospitals. METHODS: A retrospective multicentre ecological analysis was undertaken evaluating all blood cultures taken from adults from 01 April 2017 to 30 April 2020 across five acute hospitals in London. Linear trend analysis and ARIMA models allowing for seasonality were used to look for significant variation. RESULTS: One hundred nineteen thousand five hundred eighty-four blood cultures were included. At the height of the UK SARS-CoV-2 first wave in April 2020, Enterobacterales bacteraemias were at an historic low across two London trusts (63/3814, 1.65%), whilst all CoNS BSI were at an historic high (173/3814, 4.25%). This differed significantly for both Enterobacterales (p = 0.013), CoNS central line associated BSIs (CLABSI) (p < 0.01) and CoNS non-CLABSI (p < 0.01), when compared with prior periods, even allowing for seasonal variation. S. pneumoniae (p = 0.631) and S. aureus (p = 0.617) BSI did not vary significant throughout the study period. CONCLUSIONS: Significantly fewer than expected Enterobacterales BSI occurred during the UK peak of the COVID-19 pandemic; identifying potential causes, including potential unintended consequences of national self-isolation public health messaging, is essential. High rates of CoNS BSI, with evidence of increased CLABSI, but also likely contamination associated with increased use of personal protective equipment, may result in inappropriate antimicrobial use and indicates a clear area for intervention during further waves.","Denny, Sarah; Rawson, Timothy M; Hart, Peter; Satta, Giovanni; Abdulaal, Ahmed; Hughes, Stephen; Gilchrist, Mark; Mughal, Nabeela; Moore, Luke S P",BMC Infect Dis,,546

At the same time, they appear to be underrepresented in chemistry and biochemistry curricula, even though their sensitivity, selectivity, and ease of use would argue for their widespread use. We describe here an online ELISA activity suitable for stand-alone use or in conjunction with an actual wet lab ELISA. Specifically, we offer real and mock data for a hypothetical ELISA to detect plasma antibodies to COVID-19 in infected patients who have had the disease. Much of the activity focuses on chemical and mathematical models to fit ELISA or any macromolecule/ligand binding data, a skill that addresses perhaps the most relevant and difficult learning goal of an ELISA experiment.","Simpson, Kevin; Jakubowski, Henry V",,,546

In order to assist medical personnel to achieve an efficient and fast diagnosis of patients with new coronavirus pneumonia, this paper proposes an assisted diagnosis algorithm based on ensemble deep learning. The method combines the Stacked Generalization ensemble learning with the VGG16 deep learning to form a cascade classifier, and the information constituting the cascade classifier comes from multiple subsets of the training set, each of which is used to collect deviant information about the generalization behavior of the data set, such that this deviant information fills the cascade classifier. The algorithm was experimentally validated for classifying patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia, patients with common pneumonia (CP), and normal controls, and the algorithm achieved a prediction accuracy of 93.57%, sensitivity of 94.21%, specificity of 93.93%, precision of 89.40%, and F1-score of 91.74% for the three categories.

506531,What a pandemic reveals about learning in health care organizations,2021,"BACKGROUND: Despite the growth of and media hype about mobile health (mHealth), there is a paucity of literature supporting the effectiveness of widespread implementation of mHealth technologies. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to assess whether an innovative mHealth technology system with several overlapping purposes can impact (1) clinical outcomes (ie, readmission rates, revisit rates, and length of stay) and (2) patient-centered care outcomes (ie, patient engagement, patient experience, and patient satisfaction). METHODS: We compared all patients (2059 patients) of participating orthopedic surgeons using mHealth technology with all patients of nonparticipating orthopedic surgeons (2554 patients). The analyses included Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, Kruskal-Wallis tests for continuous variables, and chi-square tests for categorical variables. Logistic regression models were performed on categorical outcomes and a gamma-distributed model for continuous variables. All models were adjusted for patient demographics and comorbidities. RESULTS: The inpatient readmission rates for the nonparticipating group when compared with the participating group were higher and demonstrated higher odds ratios (ORs) for 30-day inpatient readmissions (nonparticipating group 106/2636, 4.02% and participating group 54/2048, 2.64%; OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.13; P=.04), 60-day inpatient readmissions (nonparticipating group 194/2636, 7.36% and participating group 85/2048, 4.15%; OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.32 to 2.39; P<.001), and 90-day inpatient readmissions (nonparticipating group 261/2636, 9.90% and participating group 115/2048, 5.62%; OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.40 to 2.34; P<.001). The length of stay for the nonparticipating cohort was longer at 1.90 days, whereas the length of stay for the participating cohort was 1.50 days (mean 1.87, SD 2 vs mean 1.50, SD 1.37; P<.001). Patients treated by participating surgeons received and read text messages using mHealth 83% of the time and read emails 84% of the time. Patients responded to 60% of the text messages and 53% of the email surveys. Patients were least responsive to digital monitoring questions when the hospital asked them to do something, and they were most engaged with emails that did not require action, including informational content. A total of 96% (558/580) of patients indicated high satisfaction with using mHealth technology to support their care. Only 0.40% (75/2059) patients opted-out of the mHealth technology program after enrollment. CONCLUSIONS: A novel, multicomponent, pathway-driven, patient-facing mHealth technology can positively impact patient outcomes and patient-reported experiences. These technologies can empower patients to play a more active and meaningful role in improving their outcomes. There is a deep need, however, for a better understanding of the interactions between patients, technology, and health care providers. Future research is needed to (1) help identify, address, and improve technology usability and effectiveness; (2) understand patient and provider attributes that support adoption, uptake, and sustainability; and (3) understand the factors that contribute to barriers of technology adoption and how best to overcome them.","Bruce, Courtenay R; Harrison, Patricia; Nisar, Tariq; Giammattei, Charlie; Tan, Neema M; Bliven, Caitlin; Shallcross, Jamie; Khleif, Aroub; Tran, Nhan; Kelkar, Sayali; Tobias, Noreen; Chavez, Ana E; Rivera, Dana; Leong, Angela; Romano, Angela; Desai, S Nicholas; Sol, Josh R; Gutierrez, Kayla; Rappel, Christopher; Haas, Eric; Zheng, Feibi; Park, Kwan J; Jones, Stephen; Barach, Paul; Schwartz, Roberta",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,,546

Due to Covid-19's severe economic impacts, the establishment of reliable determining factors can help to alleviate future pandemics. While a population density is often cited as a major determinant of infectious cases and mortality rates, there are both proponents and opponents to this claim. In this framework, the study seeks to assess the role of population density as a predictor of Covid-19 cases and deaths in Saudi Arabia and China during the Covid-19 pandemic. With high infectivity and mortality being a definitive characteristic of overpopulated regions, the authors propose that Henry Kissinger's population reduction theory can be applied as a control measure to control future pandemics and alleviate social concerns. If high-density Chinese regions are more susceptible to Covid-19 than low-density Saudi cities, the authors argue that Neo-Malthusian models can be used as a basis for reducing the impacts of the coronavirus disease on the economic growth in countries with low population density. However, the performed correlation analysis and simple linear regression produced controversial results with no clear connection between the three studied variables.

In the ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectrum analysis, the defective TiO(x) thin film was found to generate the red shift effect. To determine whether the defective TiO(x) thin film has antibacterial ability under visible light, we designed a series of experiments according to the Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS) Committee standard for testing antibacterial performance and for exploring the impact of surface roughness of substrate. Our results show that the antibacterial performance rate against Escherichia coli could reach 99.99% in visible light. We also proved that the coating technology can be applied effectively to surfaces with different degrees of roughness. It is suitable for protecting both human health and the natural environment.","Shieh, Kuan-Jiunn; Li, Min; Lee, Yu-Hwe; Sheu, Shinn-Der; Liu, Yu-Tsung; Wang, Yau-Chyr",Nanomedicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17292124/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1549963406000414; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1549963406000414,546

Two months into the COVID-19 outbreak, however, a retrospective study in China involving more than 200 participants revealed a neurological component to COVID-19 in a subset of patients. The observed symptoms, the cause of which remains unclear, included impaired consciousness, skeletal muscle injury and acute cerebrovascular disease, and appeared more frequently in severe disease. Since then, findings from several studies have hinted at various possible neurological outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Here, we review the historical association between neurological complications and highly pathological coronaviruses including SARS, MERS and COVID-19. We draw from evidence derived from past coronavirus outbreaks, noting the similarities and differences between SARS and MERS and the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Based on real-time data in 276 prefecture-level Chinese cities, we used the ordinary least squares plus robust standard error strategy. It was found that: (1) despite the non-significant effect of city size, urban governance capacity was an important factor affecting the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic; urban governance capacity was particularly significant in the late control of the pandemic, but not significant in the early prevention; for every unit increase of urban governance capacity, the number of recovered COVID-19 cases per capita increased by 2.4%. Moreover, (2) the influence mechanism of anti-pandemic measures in cities could be divided into the workforce, financial, and material effects, and their contribution rates were 26.15%, 32.55%, and 37.20%, respectively; namely, the effective/timely assistance from Chinese central government regarding the workforce, financial, and material resources in key pandemic areas and nationwide played a major role in pandemic control.

It is unclear if screening and diagnostic mammography volumes have recovered to pre-pandemic levels and whether utilization has varied by women’s characteristics. METHODS: We collected data on 461,083 screening mammograms and 112,207 diagnostic mammograms conducted during January 2019 through July 2020 at 62 radiology facilities in the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium. We compared monthly screening and diagnostic mammography volumes before and during the pandemic, stratified by age, race/ethnicity, breast density, and family history of breast cancer. RESULTS: Screening and diagnostic mammography volumes in April 2020 were 1.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.5% to 2.4%) and 21.4% (95% CI = 18.7% to 24.4%) of April 2019 pre-pandemic volumes, respectively, but by July 2020 rebounded to 89.7% (95% CI = 79.6% to 101.1%) and 101.6% (95% CI = 93.8% to 110.1%) of July 2019 pre-pandemic volumes, respectively. The year-to-date cumulative volume of screening and diagnostic mammograms performed through July 2020 was 66.2% (95% CI = 60.3% to 72.6%) and 79.9% (95% CI = 75.4% to 84.6%), respectively, of year-to-date volume through July 2019. Screening mammography rebound was similar across age groups and by family history of breast cancer.

617806,Von Willebrand factor,2020,"Background: Risk of aerosolisation of SARS-CoV-2 directly informs organisation of acute healthcare and PPE guidance. Continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) and high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) are widely used modes of oxygen delivery and respiratory support for patients with severe COVID-19, with both considered as high risk aerosol generating procedures. However, there are limited high quality experimental data characterising aerosolisation during oxygen delivery and respiratory support. Methods: Healthy volunteers were recruited to breathe, speak, and cough in ultra-clean, laminar flow theatres followed by using oxygen and respiratory support systems. Aerosol emission was measured using two discrete methodologies, simultaneously. Hospitalised patients with COVID-19 were also recruited and had aerosol emissions measured during breathing, speaking, and coughing. Findings: In healthy volunteers (n = 25 subjects; 531 measures), CPAP (with exhalation port filter) produced less aerosols than breathing, speaking and coughing (even with large >50L/m facemask leaks). HFNO did emit aerosols, but the majority of these particles were generated from the HFNO machine, not the patient. HFNO-generated particles were small (<1 micron), passing from the machine through the patient and to the detector without coalescence with respiratory aerosol, thereby unlikely to carry viral particles. Coughing was associated with the highest aerosol emissions with a peak concentration at least 10 times greater the mean concentration generated from speaking or breathing. Hospitalised patients with COVID-19 (n = 8 subjects; 56 measures) had similar size distributions to healthy volunteers. Interpretation: In healthy volunteers, CPAP is associated with less aerosol emission than breathing, speaking or coughing. Aerosol emission from the respiratory tract does not appear to be increased by HFNO. Although direct comparisons are complex, cough appears to generate significant aerosols in a size range compatible with airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2. As a consequence, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 aerosolisation is likely to be high in all areas where patients with Covid-19 are coughing. Guidance on personal protective equipment policy should reflect these updated risks.

Our model was able to provide a good fit to the trajectory of the outbreak and was useful to analyze the role of hypothetical control scenarios. Specifically, we assessed the impact of the timing of control measures, especially associated with a reduction of the transmission rate and diagnostic delays on outbreak size and duration. Early interventions within 1 week after the epidemic onset, for instance, including the initial government announcement to the public about the list of hospitals exposed to MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), show a promising means to reduce the size ([Formula: see text]) and duration ([Formula: see text]) of the MERS epidemic.

Epidemiological data showing a differential impact of SARS‐CoV‐2 infection on women and men have suggested a potential role for testosterone (T) in determining gender disparity in the SARS‐CoV‐2 clinical outcomes. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the association between T level and SARS‐CoV‐2 clinical outcomes (defined as conditions requiring transfer to higher or lower intensity of care or death) in a cohort of patients admitted in the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A consecutive series of 31 male patients affected by SARS‐CoV‐2 pneumonia and recovered in the respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) of the “Carlo Poma” Hospital in Mantua were analyzed. Several biochemical risk factors (ie, blood count and leukocyte formula, C‐reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, D‐dimer, fibrinogen, interleukin 6 (IL‐6)) as well as total testosterone (TT), calculated free T (cFT), sex hormone–binding globulin (SHBG), and luteinizing hormone (LH) were determined. RESULTS: Lower TT and cFT were found in the transferred to ICU/deceased in RICU group vs groups of patients transferred to IM or maintained in the RICU in stable condition. Both TT and cFT showed a negative significant correlation with biochemical risk factors (ie, the neutrophil count, LDH, and PCT) but a positive association with the lymphocyte count. Likewise, TT was also negatively associated with CRP and ferritin levels. A steep increase in both ICU transfer and mortality risk was observed in men with TT < 5 nmol/L or cFT < 100 pmol/L. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates for the first time that lower baseline levels of TT and cFT levels predict poor prognosis and mortality in SARS‐CoV‐2‐infected men admitted to RICU.","Rastrelli, Giulia; Di Stasi, Vincenza; Inglese, Francesco; Beccaria, Massimiliano; Garuti, Martina; Di Costanzo, Domenica; Spreafico, Fabio; Greco, Graziana Francesca; Cervi, Giulia; Pecoriello, Antonietta; Magini, Angela; Todisco, Tommaso; Cipriani, Sarah; Maseroli, Elisa; Corona, Giovanni; Salonia, Andrea; Lenzi, Andrea; Maggi, Mario; De Donno, Giuseppe; Vignozzi, Linda",Andrology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32436355/; https://doi.org/10.1111/andr.12821,546

METHODS: The CoVIG was manufactured from plasma donors who had recovered from COVID-19. The dose used (400 mg/kg) was based on the dose given in clinical trials to hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Hamsters were given a single dose of CoVIG two days after challenge with the SARS-CoV-2 virus (isolate NY/PV08410/2020), followed by sampling of blood, nasal, tracheal and lung tissues at different time points. The blood samples were assayed for anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike binding and used to calculate PK parameters. Nasal washes, trachea, and lung samples were assayed for viral replication by PCR (sgRNA). RESULTS: CoVIG-treated hamsters showed a reduction in viral replication in the lower respiratory tract, but minimally in the upper respiratory tract, following challenge with SARS-CoV-2. Challenge with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in altered PK parameters proportionate to viral replication, resulting in decreased area under the curve (AUC), accelerated clearance and shorter half-life of CoVIG. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that in the presence of actively replicating SARS-CoV-2 virus, PK parameters are altered and should trigger an adjustment in dosing of CoVIG.","Stauft, Charles B; Tegenge, Million; Khurana, Surender; Lee, Youri; Selvaraj, Prabhuanand; Golding, Hana; Wang, Tony; Golding, Basil",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34554235/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab854,546

An uncritical acceptance of empiricism, or even of evidence-based medicine, however, can also be problematic. OBJECTIVES: With reference to a specific type of medical denialism associated with moral failure, justified by dissident AIDS and anti-vaccine scientific publications, this paper seeks to make the argument that this type of denialism meets certain longstanding definitions for classification as pseudoscience. METHODS: This paper uses a conceptual framework to make certain arguments and to juxtapose arguments for evidence-based approaches to medicine against literature that highlights certain limitations of an unquestioning approach to empiricism. RESULTS: Discussions of certain real life examples are used to derive the important insight that, under certain conditions, moral failure can result in the violation both Type I and Type II scientific error types, with catastrophic consequences. CONCLUSION: It is argued that the validity of all theory should not be assumed before sufficient empirical evidence has accumulated to support its validity across contexts.

The mode of entry for SARS-CoV-2 into host cells occurs through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. As part of the efforts to mitigate COVID-19 infections, rapid and accurate detection methods, as well as smart vaccine and drug designs with SARS-CoV-2 targeting capabilities are critically needed. This systematic review aimed to present a good mapping between the structural and functional characteristics of aptamers and their potential applications in COVID-19 theranostics. METHODS: In this study, extensive discussions into the potential development of aptameric systems as robust theranostics for rapid mitigation of the virulent SARS-CoV-2 was made. Information required for this study were extracted from a systematic review of literature in PubMed, SCOPUS, Web of Science (WOS), and other official related reports from reputable organisations. RESULTS: The global burden of COVID-19 pandemic was discussed including the progress in rapid detection, repurposing of existing antiviral drugs, and development of prophylactic vaccines. Aptamers have highly specific and stable target binding characteristics which can be generated and engineered with less complexity for COVID-19 targeted theranostic applications. CONCLUSIONS: There is an urgent need to develop safe innovative biomedical technologies to mitigate the dire impact of COVID-19 on public health worldwide. Research advances into aptameric systems bode well with the fact that they can be engineered for the development of effective and affordable diagnostics, therapeutics and prophylactic vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 and other infectious pathogens.","Acquah, Caleb; Jeevanandam, Jaison; Tan, Kei Xian; Danquah, Michael K.",Cell Mol Bioeng,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33488836/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12195-020-00664-7,546

There has been substantial research regarding comorbid conditions, such as obesity and diabetes, and COVID-19 outcomes in adults, yet much is still unknown in the pediatric population. Study Objective: This study sought to examine comorbid conditions as risk factors associated with severe outcomes among pediatric COVID-19 patients. Methods: In this cross-sectional retrospective study we used data mining approaches on the Cerner multicenter dataset to retrieve an extensive list of comorbidities including pre-existing and concurrent conditions in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 (> 29 days and <21 years, hospitalized 3/1-6/30/20). Complications were defined as death or mechanical ventilator use. A nested mixed effects model was built on the most common comorbid conditions. All variables were assessed using the generalized variance inflation factor. Corresponding two-way statistical interactions with age were considered while controlling for patient demographics and payer type;the final model was selected using backward elimination procedures. Results: There were 2480 encounters from 2320 patients;17.1% required a ventilator and 0.85% died (19/21 patients who died required mechanical ventilation). 25.8% of patients were <2, 16% were 6-11, and 29.6% were 12-18. Male patients comprised 52.1%, and 48.3% were White/Caucasian, 21.8% were Hispanic, and 15.1% were African American/Black. Males were at 36% increased odds of complication (IOC), and Black/African American patients were found to be at 63% IOC. Patients with bacterial pneumonia and severe sepsis had 330% and 314% IOC respectively. Heart failure, 738% IOC, coagulation defect, 722% IOC, and patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), 693% IOC, were among the highest risk factors in this study. Obese patients had 246% IOC. Interestingly, the increased risk of complications in patients with epilepsy and acute kidney failure was age dependent. Patients with epilepsy > 5 years were at higher odds of complication and those odds increased with age, whereas younger patients with acute kidney failure were more at risk. The highest risk factor for complication was found to be ileus, OR=11.9. Of 40 patients with ileus, 3 died and 26 required mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: Risk factors for complications of SARS-CoV-2 infection encompass a variety of conditions including obesity, epilepsy, PDA, bacterial pneumonia, sepsis, acute kidney failure, and ileus. Further studies are needed to explore these associations which may help elucidate why certain children suffer increased complications as well as inform treatment decisions.","Heyming, T.; Spiegelman, L.; Marano, R.; Taraman, S.; Feaster, W.; Keskinocak, P.; Ehwerhemuepha, L.",Annals of Emergency Medicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.annemergmed.2021.07.014; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0196064421005734; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0196064421005734,546
659179,Head teachers’ opinions on the future of school education conditioned by emergency remote teaching,2021-06-05,"OBJECTIVES: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, a novel coronavirus, affects mainly the pulmonary parenchyma and produces significant morbidity and mortality. During the pandemic, several complications have been shown to be associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Our goal was to present a series of patients with COVID-19 who underwent chest tube placements due to the development of pleural complications and to make suggestions for the insertion and follow-up management of the chest tube. METHODS: We retrospectively collected and analysed data on patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in our hospital between 11 March and 15 May 2020. Patients from this patient group who developed pleural complications requiring chest tube insertion were included in the study. RESULTS: A total of 542 patients who were suspected of having COVID-19 were hospitalized. The presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was confirmed with laboratory tests in 342 patients between 11 March and 15 May 2020 in our centre. A chest tube was used in 13 (3.8%) of these patients. A high-efficiency particulate air filter mounted double-bottle technique was used to prevent viral transmission. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with COVID-19, the chest tube can be applied in cases with disease or treatment-related pleural complications. Our case series comprised a small group of patients, which is one of its limitations. Still, our main goal was to present our experience with patients with pleural complications and describe a new drainage technique to prevent viral transmission during chest tube application and follow-up.","Ceylan, Kenan Can; Batihan, Guntug; Yazgan, Serkan; Gürsoy, Soner; Kıraklı, Sami Cenk; Ataman, Sena",Eur J Cardiothorac Surg,https://doi.org/10.1093/ejcts/ezaa356; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33164094/,546
660163,Online learning satisfaction in higher education during the COVID-19 pandemic: A regional comparison between Eastern and Western Chinese universities,2021-03-31,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding RNAs that control many functions within the human cells by controlling protein levels through binding to messenger RNA (mRNA) translation process or mRNA abundance. Many pieces of evidence show that miRNAs affect the viral RNA replication and pathogenesis through direct binding to the RNA virus to mediate changes in the host transcriptome. Many previous studies have been studying the interaction between human cells' miRNA and viral RNA to predict many targets along the viral genome. In this work, via the miRDB database, we determined the target scores of predicted human miRNA to bind with the ss-RNA of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in general and its spike gene in specific. Our predicted miRNA targets of the ss-RNA of SARS-CoV-2 might destabilize the ss-RNA translation of SARS-CoV-2 that has been established by more than 80% of asymptomatic infected cases in Jordan due to host miRNA interactions. In respiratory epithelial cells, the high prediction scoring for miRNAs covers the RNA from 5′ to 3′ that explains successful antiviral defenses against ss-RNA of SARS-CoV-2 and might lead to new nucleotide deletion mechanisms. The exciting findings here that the nucleotide substitution 1841A > G at the viral genomic RNA level, which is an amino acid substation D614G at the spike protein level showed a change in the predicted miRNA sequence from hsa-miR-4793-5p to hsa-miR-3620-3p with an increase in the target score from 91 to 92.","Haddad, Hazem; Walid Al-Zyoud",Noncoding RNA Res,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2468054020300548; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2468054020300548?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839745/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ncrna.2020.08.002,546

Data were collected during their Vitamin D winter (monthly mean UVvitd of under 165 KJ/m2) from Jan to April 2020. Participants The at-risk population is the total county population, with measures to incorporate spatial infection into the model. The model is adjusted for: age, ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, long term PM2.5, and UV weighted by the vitamin D action spectrum. Main outcome measures We derive UVA measures for each area and estimate their relationship with COVID-19 mortality with a random effect for States, in a multilevel zero-inflated negative binomial model. In the USA and England death certificates had to record COVID-19. In Italy excess deaths in 2020 over expected from 2015-19. Data sources Satellite derived mean daily UVA dataset from Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Data on deaths compiled by Center for Disease Control (USA), Office for National Statistics (England) and Italian Institute of Statistics. Results Daily mean UVA (January-April 2020) varied between 450 to 1,000 KJ/m2 across the three countries. Our fully adjusted model showed an inverse correlation between UVA and COVID-19 mortality with a Mortality Risk Ratio (MRR) of 0.73 (0.62 to 0.87)per 100KJ/m2 increase UVA in the USA, 0.81 (0.71 to 0.93) in Italy and 0.51 (0.39 to 0.66) in England. Pooled MRR was 0.68 (0.53 to 0.66). Conclusions Our analysis, replicated in 3 independent national datasets, suggests ambient UVA exposure is associated with lower COVID-19 specific mortality. This effect is independent of vitamin D, as it occurred at irradiances below that likely to induce significant cutaneous vitamin D3 synthesis.

To obtain insight into the changes the pandemic has wrought in the lives and careers of women and parents in academia, we surveyed scholars in political science and international studies. The survey was in the field during the period in which many academics were experiencing shelter-at-home orders and adjusting to a new reality. It captures initial reactions to changed circumstances as well as the fears and anticipated consequences of the disruptions. We find that perceptions of a negative impact are broadly shared.

668096,The Protective Effect of Rheumatic Disease Agents in COVID-19,2021-01-13,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibody responses to the spike (S) protein monomer, S protein native trimeric form, or the nucleocapsid (N) proteins were evaluated in cohorts of individuals with acute infection (n = 93) and in individuals enrolled in a postinfection seroprevalence population study (n = 578) in Switzerland. Commercial assays specific for the S1 monomer, for the N protein, or within a newly developed Luminex assay using the S protein trimer were found to be equally sensitive in antibody detection in the acute-infection-phase samples. Interestingly, compared to anti-S antibody responses, those against the N protein appear to wane in the postinfection cohort. Seroprevalence in a “positive patient contacts” group (n = 177) was underestimated by N protein assays by 10.9 to 32.2%, while the “randomly selected” general population group (n = 311) was reduced by up to 45% relative to the S protein assays. The overall reduction in seroprevalence targeting only anti-N antibodies for the total cohort ranged from 9.4 to 31%. Of note, the use of the S protein in its native trimer form was significantly more sensitive compared to monomeric S proteins. These results indicate that the assessment of anti-S IgG antibody responses against the native trimeric S protein should be implemented to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infections in population-based seroprevalence studies. IMPORTANCE In the present study, we have determined SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in sera of acute and postinfection phase subjects. Our results indicate that antibody responses against viral S and N proteins were equally sensitive in the acute phase of infection, but that responses against N appear to wane in the postinfection phase where those against the S protein persist over time. The most sensitive serological assay in both acute and postinfection phases used the native S protein trimer as the binding antigen, which has significantly greater conformational epitopes for antibody binding compared to the S1 monomer protein used in other assays. We believe these results are extremely important in order to generate correct estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the general population. Furthermore, the assessment of antibody responses against the trimeric S protein will be critical to evaluate the durability of the antibody response and for the characterization of a vaccine-induced antibody response.","Fenwick, Craig; Croxatto, Antony; Coste, Alix T.; Pojer, Florence; André, Cyril; Pellaton, Céline; Farina, Alex; Campos, Jérémy; Hacker, David; Lau, Kelvin; Bosch, Berend-Jan; Gonseth Nussle, Semira; Bochud, Murielle; D’Acremont, Valerie; Trono, Didier; Greub, Gilbert; Pantaleo, Giuseppe",J Virol,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01828-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33144321/,546

SARS-CoV-2 is composed of 14 open reading frames (ORFs), which encodes for a total of 27 proteins divided into structural and non-structural proteins (NSPs). The fundamental structural protein-encoding genes are a spike protein (S) gene, envelope protein (E) gene, a membrane protein (M) gene, and a nucleocapsid protein (N) gene. They make about 33% of the entire genome and are vital for the viral life cycle. Rest 67% is distributed among different NSPs (such as M(pro), helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) encoding genes across the ORFs, which are involved in virus-cell receptor interactions during viral entry. Researchers are trying to formulate vaccines, therapeutic antibodies or protein-targeted antiviral drugs to control the spread. This review proceeds stepwise through the COVID-19 outbreak, structural and genomic organization, entry mechanism, pathogenesis, and finally highlighting the essential proteins involved at each step that might be potential targets for drug discovery.

However, vaccine development for this pathogen lags behind as immunity associated with protection is currently largely unknown. In this study, an immunoinformatics-driven genome-wide screening strategy of vaccine targets was performed to thoroughly screen the vital and effective dominant immunogens against MERS-CoV. Conservancy and population coverage analysis of the epitopes were done by the Immune Epitope Database. The results showed that the nucleocapsid (N) protein of MERS-CoV might be a better protective immunogen with high conservancy and potential eliciting both neutralizing antibodies and T-cell responses compared with spike (S) protein. Further, the B-cell, helper T-cell and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes were screened and mapped to the N protein. A total of 15 linear and 10 conformal B-cell epitopes that may induce protective neutralizing antibodies were obtained. Additionally, a total of 71 peptides with 9-mer core sequence were identified as helper T-cell epitopes, and 34 peptides were identified as CTL epitopes. Based on the maximum HLA binding alleles, top 10 helper T-cell epitopes and CTL epitopes that may elicit protective cellular immune responses against MERS-CoV were selected as MERS vaccine candidates. Population coverage analysis showed that the putative helper T-cell epitopes and CTL epitopes could cover the vast majority of the population in 15 geographic regions considered where vaccine would be employed. The B- and T-cell stimulation potentials of the screened epitopes is to be further validated for their efficient use as vaccines against MERS-CoV. Collectively, this study provides novel vaccine target candidates and may prompt further development of vaccines against MERS-CoV and other emerging infectious diseases.","Shi, Jiandong; Zhang, Jing; Li, Sijin; Sun, Jing; Teng, Yumei; Wu, Meini; Li, Jianfan; Li, Yanhan; Hu, Ningzhu; Wang, Haixuan; Hu, Yunzhang",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26641892/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0144475,546

In our country, due to shortage of hospitals and beds in intensive care unit, oncological and breast cancer (BC) resources are temporarily shifted to COVID-19 patients. In addition, risk of cross-infections should be considered in these frail patients. To accomplish more surgical procedures and to reduce the length of hospital stay (LOS), fast track awake BC surgery should be implemented. The aim of the study is to estimate the effects of surgical shift in our facility during the early COVID-19 outbreak. MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 30th January 2020 to 30th of March 2020, 86 consecutive patients were retrospectively enrolled and divided into pre-COVID-19-BC and COVID-19-BC. Clinical parameters and anamnestic data were collected and analyzed. Surgical procedures, relative complications and type of anaesthesia were reported. The effect on surgical time (ST), operative room time (ORT) and length of stay (LOS) were described and examined. RESULTS: No statistical difference was found in complications rate, clinical data and surgical procedures (p > 0.05). Awake breast conservative surgery (BCS) was the most frequent procedure in COVID-19-BC (p = 0.006). A statistically significant decrease in ORT and LOS was reported in COVID-19-BC (p = 0.040 and p = 0.0015 respectively), while comparable time resulted for ST (p = 0.976). Mean ORT and LOS reduction were 20.79 min and 0.57 hospital bed days. CONCLUSION: In the “COVID-19 era”, fast track awake breast surgery provides a reduction of ORT, LOS and potentially surgical treatment for a wider number of oncological patients.","Vanni, Gianluca; Pellicciaro, Marco; Materazzo, Marco; Dauri, Mario; D’angelillo, Rolando Maria; Buonomo, Chiara; De Majo, Adriano; Pistolese, Chiara; Portarena, Ilaria; Mauriello, Alessandro; Servadei, Francesca; Giacobbi, Erica; Chiaravalloti, Agostino; Buonomo, Oreste Claudio",Breast Cancer,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32734327/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s12282-020-01137-5,546
