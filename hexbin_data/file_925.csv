143034,"Reliability of Primary Health Care Audiograms by Non-Qualified Examiners-An Analysis of 1,224 Cases.",2020-12-21,"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has proposed to eliminate payments for the Inpatient and Outpatient Consultation codes beginning on 1 January 2010. The intent appears to be to promote an increase in the supply of primary physicians by increasing payments for other Evaluation and Management services. This will worsen an already inequitable disparity in the payments for complex cognitive services in comparison to procedure-based specialties, to the detriment of infectious diseases physicians. Infectious diseases as a specialty is committed to health care reform that makes sense for both patients and providers. An unintended consequence of the CMS proposal may be that few infectious diseases physicians remain to confront current or future infectious diseases challenges.","Martinelli, Lawrence P; McQuillen, Daniel P; Scull, Jason A",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1086/606061; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19719416/,925

237713,Estimated SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence in Healthy Children and Those with Chronic Illnesses in the Washington Metropolitan Area as of October 2020,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The psychological distress caused by COVID-19 may be pronounced among the parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study aimed to investigate psychological distress among parents of children with ASD during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A total of 1764 parents of children with ASD and 4962 parents of typically developing (TD) children were recruited. The participants completed an online survey which contained demographic information, the impact due to COVID-19 crisis, resilience, coping styles, anxiety and depression. Hierarchical linear regression was used to assess the contributions of these variables to anxiety and depression. RESULTS: After adjusting for demographic variables, the following factors were associated with parents' anxiety and depression symptoms: (i) Whether or not the participants had a child with ASD; (ii) resilience; (iii) coping strategies, and; (iv) the impact due to COVID-19. Among these, the psychological stress caused by COVID-19 played the most important role in parental anxiety (ß = 0.353) and depression (ß = 0.242) symptoms. Parents of children with ASD had lower levels of resilience and positive coping, and used more negative coping strategies than parents of TD children. Among all participants, 8.0 and 24.2% of parents had symptoms of anxiety and depression, respectively. Compared to parents of TD children, more parents of children with ASD exhibited symptoms of anxiety and depression (12.2% vs. 6.6%; 31.0% vs. 21.7%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents experienced varying levels of anxiety and depression, particularly, parents of children with ASD. More specific attention should be paid to parental mental health and long-term effective intervention programs, that are targeted towards parents of children with ASD, and such programs should be promoted around China in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis.","Wang, Luxi; Li, Dexin; Pan, Shixu; Zhai, Jinhe; Xia, Wei; Sun, Caihong; Zou, Mingyang",Global Health,,925

590904,Decline in Sars‐CoV‐2 antibodies over 6‐month follow‐up in obstetrical healthcare workers,2021-08-22,"PURPOSE: This study was performed to determine the occurrence of ocular surface manifestations in patients diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) due to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: A systematic search of electronic databases i.e. PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, OVID and Google scholar was performed using a comprehensive search strategy. The searches were current through 31st May 2020. Pooled data from cross-sectional studies was used for meta-analysis and a narrative synthesis was conducted for studies where a meta-analysis was not feasible. RESULTS: A total of 16 studies reporting 2347 confirmed COVID-19 cases were included. Pooled data showed that 11.64% of COVID-19 patients had ocular surface manifestations. Ocular pain (31.2%), discharge (19.2%), redness (10.8%), and follicular conjunctivitis (7.7%) were the main features. 6.9% patients with ocular manifestations had severe pneumonia. Viral RNA was detected from the ocular specimens in 3.5% patients. CONCLUSION: The most common reported ocular presentations of COVID-19 included ocular pain, redness, discharge, and follicular conjunctivitis. A small proportion of patients had viral RNA in their conjunctival/tear samples. The available studies show significant publication bias and heterogeneity. Prospective studies with methodical collection and data reporting are needed for evaluation of ocular involvement in COVID-19.","Aggarwal, Kanika; Agarwal, Aniruddha; Jaiswal, Nishant; Dahiya, Neha; Ahuja, Alka; Mahajan, Sarakshi; Tong, Louis; Duggal, Mona; Singh, Meenu; Agrawal, Rupesh; Gupta, Vishali",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33151999/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0241661,925
