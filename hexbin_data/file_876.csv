66603,[Prevention and control strategies and methods of novel coronavirus epidemic infection in department of otolaryngology head and neck surgery in hospital].,2020-04-07,"INTRODUCTION Systemic sclerosis (SSc) is an autoimmune disease caused by the imbalance between the activity of angiotensin II and angiotensin-(1-7). Their balance should be controlled by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which degrades angiotensin II into angiotensin-(1-7). Previously, autoantibodies to ACE2 (anti-ACE2) were identified in patients with vasculopathy due to different connective tissue diseases, including SSc, but their frequency in SSc was not further analyzed. The aim of the research was to investigate the prevalence and potential role of those anti-ACE2 antibodies in SSc patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS There were enrolled 27 patients with SSc and 23 healthy donors. ELISA assay determined the presence of anti-ACE2 autoantibodies in serum samples. The results were compared to plasma measurements of angiotensin-(1-7) level via commercial ELISA. RESULTS The presence of anti-ACE2 autoantibodies was confirmed in five patients with SSc and two healthy controls. Two of those SSc subjects were anti-Scl70+, another two were double anti-Scl70+ and anti-Ro/SSA+, and anti-PM/Scl antibodies were detected in one patient. Median plasma level of Ang-(1-7) in anti-ACE2 negative patients was 47.4 pg/ml and stayed below the detection level in anti-ACE2 positive subjects. The plasma level of Ang-(1-7) was undetectable in four SSc patients, and three of them were anti-ACE2 positive. CONCLUSIONS Anti-ACE2 antibodies appear to be other functional autoantibodies with the potential to dysregulate the balance between Ang II and Ang-(1-7). They are non-specific for SSc and probably result from polyautoimmunity which affect some of SSc patients. Their occurrence in SSc settings may be associated with a severe depletion of plasma Ang-(1-7).","Miziołek, Bartosz; Sieńczyk, Marcin; Grzywa, Renata; Łupicka-Słowik, Agnieszka; Kucharz, Eugeniusz; Kotyla, Przemysław; Bergler-Czop, Beata",Autoimmunity,https://doi.org/10.1080/08916934.2021.1916915; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33910447/,876

We retrospectively analyzed the characteristics of such patients and the impact of H&MA on the postoperative course. METHODS We evaluated 237 adult patients who underwent LT in our institute between April 2006 and October 2010. RESULTS Recipients with uncontrollable H&MA (group HA: n = 36) had more intraoperative bleeding, higher Child-Pugh scores, lower serum albumin concentrations and higher blood urea nitrogen concentrations than those without uncontrollable H&MA (group C: n = 201). They were also more likely to have preoperative hepatorenal syndrome and infections. The incidence of postoperative bacteremia was higher (55.6 vs. 46.7%, P = 0.008) and the 1- and 3-year survival rates were lower (1 year: 58.9 vs. 82.9%; 3 years: 58.9 vs. 77.7%; P = 0.003) in group HA than in group C. The multivariate proportional regression analyses revealed that uncontrollable H&MA and the Child-Pugh score were independent risk factors for the postoperative prognosis. CONCLUSIONS Postoperative infection control may be an important means of improving the outcome for patients with uncontrollable H&MA undergoing LT, and clinicians should strive to perform surgery before H&MA becomes uncontrollable.","Endo, Kosuke; Iida, Taku; Yagi, Shintaro; Yoshizawa, Atsushi; Fujimoto, Yasuhiro; Ogawa, Kohei; Ogura, Yasuhiro; Mori, Akira; Kaido, Toshimi; Uemoto, Shinji",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-014-0839-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24509883/,876

139162,[Analysis of the pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women with COVID-19 in Hubei Province].,2020-03-07,"OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS Dysfunction of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) is a common cause of oral-pharyngeal dysphagia (OPD). Dilation is a primary treatment, although current techniques are subject to a high rate of failure and recurrence. Devices available for UES dilation are cylindrical and were designed to distend the round lumen of the esophagus. Our objective was to determine the cross-sectional dimension of the UES in an ovine model of OPD and compare it with that of the cervical esophagus. STUDY DESIGN Prospective cadaveric animal study. METHODS Three-dimensional casts of the upper aerodigestive tract of 10 fresh cadaveric ewes were constructed using a platinum-cured liquid silicone polymer. Cross-sections at the level of the UES and cervical esophagus were digitized and mathematically compared using geometric morphometric shape analysis. RESULTS Consensus shape among all 10 animals revealed that the narrowest region of the maximally distended UES has a cross-sectional shape that resembles a kidney, whereas the cervical esophagus approximates a circle. The shape of the UES and cervical esophagus were significantly different (P < .0001), and surface area calculations demonstrated that an inscribed circle significantly underestimated the area implied by the kidney-shaped UES model. CONCLUSIONS Current dilators used to treat UES dysfunction are cylindrical and based on the assumption that the UES is round. This is the first report to empirically analyze the cross-sectional area of the UES utilizing an established ovine model. The data suggest that the cross-sectional area of the UES is shaped like a kidney, and currently available cylindrical dilators are suboptimal for UES distention.","Cates, Daniel; Plowman, Emily K; Mehdizadeh, Omid; Yen, Kaicheng; Domer, Amanda; Gilden, Michael; Belafsky, Peter C",The Laryngoscope,https://doi.org/10.1002/lary.23634; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23042631/,876

Open exploration is mandated in hemodynamically unstable patients, but surgical exposure can be difficult due to the concentration of vital structures and complex anatomy in this region. Computed tomographic angiography is a potential diagnostic modality in hemodynamically stable patients. In these patients, endovascular therapies may provide a feasible means of controlling hemorrhage while minimizing surgical complications. A high incidence of concomitant intrathoracic injury has resulted in an expanding role for video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. In this paper, we present a case of penetrating injury to the superior thoracic artery that was not amenable to endovascular therapy and was ultimately managed with thoracoscopic surgery.","Wong, Victor W; Gordy, Stephanie D; Schreiber, Martin; Tieu, Brandon H",Case reports in surgery,https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/413462; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23476874/,876

200526,Pneumomédiastin spontané : une complication rare du COVID-19 ?/ [Spontaneous pneumomediastinum: A rare complication of COVID-19?],2020,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SCoV) 7a protein is one of the viral accessory proteins. In expressing cells, 7a protein exhibits a variety of biological activities, including induction of apoptosis, activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, inhibition of host protein translation, and suppression of cell growth progression. Analysis of SCoV particles that were purified by either sucrose gradient equilibrium centrifugation or a virus capture assay, in which intact SCoV particles were specifically immunoprecipitated by anti-S protein monoclonal antibody, demonstrated that 7a protein was associated with purified SCoV particles. Coexpression of 7a protein with SCoV S, M, N, and E proteins resulted in production of virus-like particles (VLPs) carrying 7a protein, while 7a protein was not released from cells expressing 7a protein alone. Although interaction between 7a protein and another SCoV accessory protein, 3a, has been reported, 3a protein was dispensable for assembly of 7a protein into VLPs. S protein was not required for the 7a protein incorporation into VLPs, and yet 7a protein interacted with S protein in coexpressing cells. These data established that, in addition to 3a protein, 7a protein was a SCoV accessory protein identified as a SCoV structural protein.","Huang, Cheng; Ito, Naoto; Tseng, Chien-Te K; Makino, Shinji",Journal of virology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16840309/,876

However, there has been an increased interest in the analysis of matrix-variate data over the recent years. In this manuscript we introduce HMMs for matrix-variate longitudinal data, by assuming a matrix normal distribution in each hidden state. Such data are arranged in a four-way array. To address for possible overparameterization issues, we consider the spectral decomposition of the covariance matrices, leading to a total of 98 HMMs. An expectation-conditional maximization algorithm is discussed for parameter estimation. The proposed models are firstly investigated on simulated data, in terms of parameter recovery, computational times and model selection. Then, they are fitted to a four-way real data set concerning the unemployment rates of the Italian provinces, evaluated by gender and age classes, over the last 16 years.","Tomarchio, Salvatore D.; Punzo, Antonio; Maruotti, Antonello",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.04330v1.pdf,876

429170,[Perioperative management of cesarean section for pregnant women with suspected or confirmed COVID-19],2020,"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic many researchers and health advisory institutions have focused on virus spread prediction through epidemiological models. Such models rely on virus- and disease characteristics of which most are uncertain or even unknown for SARS-CoV-2. This study addresses the validity of various assumptions using an epidemiological simulation model. The contributions of this work are twofold. First, we show that multiple scenarios all lead to realistic numbers of deaths and ICU admissions, two observable and verifiable metrics. Second, we test the sensitivity of estimates for the number of infected and immune individuals, and show that these vary strongly between scenarios. Note that the amount of variation measured in this study is merely a lower bound: epidemiological modeling contains uncertainty on more parameters than the four in this study, and including those as well would lead to an even larger set of possible scenarios. As the level of infection and immunity among the population are particularly important for policy makers, further research on virus and disease progression characteristics is essential. Until that time, epidemiological modeling studies cannot give conclusive results and should come with a careful analysis of several scenarios on virus- and disease characteristics.","Koenen, Melissa; Balvert, Marleen; Brekelmans, Ruud; Fleuren, Hein; Stienen, Valentijn; Wagenaar, Joris",PLoS One,,876
