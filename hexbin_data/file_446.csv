4623,Quality indicators for patients with traumatic brain injury in European intensive care units: a CENTER-TBI study,2020-03-04,"BACKGROUND: Weaning of patients from the mechanical ventilation remains one of the critical decisions in intensive care unit. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of thoracic fluid content (TFC) as a predictor of weaning outcome. METHODS: An observational cohort study included 64 critically ill surgical patients who were eligible for extubation. Before initiating the spontaneous breathing trial, the TFC was measured using the electrical cardiometry technology. Patients were followed up after extubation and divided into successful weaning group and failed weaning group. Both groups were compared according to respiratory and cardiovascular parameters. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the ability of TFC to predict weaning outcome. RESULTS: The number of successfully weaned patients was 41/64 (64%). Twenty (31%) patients had impaired cardiac contractility, and of them, 13/20 (64%) patients were successfully extubated. Both groups, successful weaning group and failed weaning group, were comparable in most of baseline characteristics; however, the TFC was significantly higher in the failed weaning group compared to the successful weaning group. The area under the ROC curves (AUCs) showed moderate predictive ability for the TFC in predicting weaning failure (AUC [95% confidence interval] 0.69 [0.57–0.8], cutoff value > 50 kΩ(−1)), while the predictive ability of TFC was excellent in the subgroup of patients with ejection fraction < 40% (AUC [95% confidence interval 0.93 [0.72–1], cutoff value > 50 kΩ(−1)). CONCLUSIONS: Thoracic fluid content showed moderate ability for predicting weaning outcome in surgical critically ill patients. However, in the subgroup of patients with ejection fraction less than 40%, TFC above 50 kΩ(−1) has an excellent ability to predict weaning failure.","Fathy, Shymaa; Hasanin, Ahmed M.; Raafat, Mohamed; Mostafa, Maha M.

Adult hookworms survive for many years in the host intestine, where they suck blood, causing iron deficiency anemia and malnutrition. Numerous molecules, named excretory/secretory (ES) products, are secreted by hookworm adults and/or larvae to aid in parasite survival and pathobiology. Although the molecular cloning and characterization of hookworm ES products began 25 years ago, the biological role and molecular nature of many of them are still unclear. Hookworm ES products, with distinct structures and functions, have been linked to many essential events in the disease pathogenesis. These events include host invasion and tissue migration, parasite nourishment and reproduction, and immune modulation. Several of these products represent promising vaccine targets for controlling hookworm disease and therapeutic targets for many inflammatory diseases. This review aims to summarize our present knowledge about hookworm ES products, including their role in parasite biology, host-parasite interactions, and as vaccine and pharmaceutical targets and to identify research gaps and future research directions in this field.

4681,"Trends, risk factors and outcomes of healthcare-associated infections in a neonatal intensive care unit in Italy during 2013–2017",2020-03-18,"OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the effects of dipyrithione (PTS2) on the expression of IP-10/CXCL10, which has been observed in a wide variety of chronic inflammatory disorders and autoimmune conditions. METHODS: RAW264.7 cells (a murine macrophage-like cell line) were cultured in the absence or in the presence of PTS2 (3–10 μM) together with or without IFN-γ (10 ng/ml). IP-10/CXCL10 expression was measured by specific enzyme-amplified immunoassays and reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR). Phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2 and STAT1 were detected by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: We found that PTS2 inhibited IFN-γ-induced up-regulation of IP-10/CXCL10 protein level in a dose- and time-dependent manner in RAW264.7 cells. RT-PCR experiments showed that PTS2 suppressed IFN-γ-induced IP-10/CXCL10 expression at mRNA levels. Mechanistically, PTS2 prevented phosphorylation of JAK1, JAK2 and STAT1, but did not interfere with the p38 pathway. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of PTS2 on IP-10/CXCL10 up-regulation was slightly stronger than JAK2 inhibitor AG490. CONCLUSION: PTS2 inhibits IFN-γ-induced IP-10/CXCL10 expression in RAW264.7 cells by targeting the JAK/STAT1 signaling pathway, suggesting that PTS2 could exert anti-inflammatory effects through attenuating the formation of chemokine IP-10/CXCL10.","Han, Cui; Fu, Jin; Liu, Ziwen; Huang, Huang; Luo, Lan; Yin, Zhimin",Inflamm Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7079753/,446
5744,Vital signs: the first step in prevention and management of critical illness in resource-limited settings,2016-05-20,"Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a slowly progressing fatal human disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that is associated with measles virus persistence. Virus nucleocapsids are present in the brain(1,2) and the patient is in a state of hyperimmunization towards this agent. However, although all other structural polypeptides are recognized by the immune system, there is a markedly decreased antibody response towards virus matrix or membrane protein(3,4). Matrix protein has not been detected in brain cells(5) and infectious virus is not present. The absence of this virus structural polypeptide is thought to account for the apparent restriction in virus maturation both in vivo and in vitro. SSPE viruses can only rarely be rescued from brain tissue by co-cultivation or cell fusion techniques using tissue culture cell lines susceptible to measles virus infection(6). Often this procedure fails to yield a lytic budding virus but produces instead a carrier cell line in which the agent is cell associated. These lines (known as SSPE cell lines) also do not contain matrix protein(7,8). However, the reason for this deficiency is unknown. We have therefore now examined an SSPE cell line which does not yield infectious virus in order to define this process further. We found that although messenger RNA for membrane protein was present, it was unable to form normal matrix protein in translation reactions.","Carter, Michael J.; Willcocks, Margaret M.; ter Meulen, Volker",Nature,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7094927/,446

We assessed outcomes of 218 patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML n=94) or acute lymphoblastic leukemia (n=124) in complete remission (CR) who had received a single-unit unrelated cord blood transplant (UCBT) from a KIR-ligand-compatible or -incompatible donor. Grafts were HLA-A, -B or -DRB1 matched (n=21) or mismatched (n=197). Patients and donors were categorized according to their degree of KIR-ligand compatibility in the graft-versus-host direction by determining whether or not they expressed HLA-C group 1 or 2, HLA-Bw4 or HLA-A3/-A11. Both HLA-C/-B KIR-ligand- and HLA-A-A3/-A11 KIR-ligand-incompatible UCBT showed a trend to improved LFS (P=0.09 and P=0.13, respectively). Sixty-nine donor–patient pairs were HLA-A, -B or -C KIR-ligand incompatible and 149 compatible. KIR-ligand-incompatible UCBT showed improved LFS (hazards ratio=2.05, P=0.0016) and overall survival (OS) (hazards ratio=2.0, P=0.004) and decreased RI (hazards ratio=0.53, P=0.05). These results were more evident for AML transplant recipients (2-year LFS and RI with or without KIR-ligand incompatibility 73 versus 38% (P=0.012), and 5 versus 36% (P=0.005), respectively). UCBT for acute leukemia in CR from KIR-ligand-incompatible donors is associated with decreased RI and improved LFS and OS.

After showing some evidence of human and non-human primate PV recombination, we report a comprehensive recombination analysis of all currently known 82 Alphapapillomaviruses (Alpha-PVs). We carried out an exploratory study and found novel recombination events between High-Risk HPV Types and Macaca fascicularis PV1 (MfPV1), Macaca Fuscata PV2 (MfuPV2) and Pan Paniscus PV1 (PpPV1) Papillomaviruses. This is the first evidence of interactions between PVs from different hosts and hence postulates the likelihood of ancient host switching among Alpha-PVs. Notwithstanding these results should be interpreted with caution because the major and minor parents indicated by RDP4 program are simply the sequences in the alignment that most closely resemble the actual parents. We found statistically significant differences between the phylogenies of the PV sequences with recombination regions and PV sequences without recombination regions using the Shimodaira–Hasegawa phylogenetic incongruence testing. We show that not more than 76MYA Alpha-PVs were in the same biological niche, a pre-requisite for recombination, and as the hosts evolved and diversified, the viruses adapted to specific host niches which eventually led to coevolution with specific hosts before speciation of primate species. Thus providing evidence that in ancient times no earlier than the Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic age, Alpha-PVs recombined and switched hosts, but whether this host switching is occurring currently is unknown. However, a clearer picture of the PVs evolutionary landscape can only be achieved with the incremental discovery of PV sequences, especially from the animal kingdom.

11038,The Golden Hour: a quality improvement initiative for extremely premature infants in the neonatal intensive care unit,2019-11-11,"INTRODUCTION: Robotic-assisted bariatric surgery is increasingly performed. There remains controversy about the overall benefit of robotic-assisted (RBS) compared to conventional laparoscopic (LBS) bariatric surgery. In this study, we used a large national risk-stratified bariatric clinical database to compare outcomes between robotic and laparoscopic gastric bypass (RNYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG). METHODS: A retrospective analysis of the 2015 and 2016 Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery Accreditation and Quality Improvement Program (MBSAQIP) Participant Use Data File (PUF) was performed. Primary robotic and laparoscopic RYNGB and SG were analyzed. Descriptive analysis was performed of the unmatched cohorts, followed by 1:3 case-controlled matching. Cases and controls were matched by patient demographics and pre-operative comorbidities, and peri-operative outcomes compared. RESULTS: 77,991 Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RnYGB) (7.5% robotic-assisted) and 189,503 SG (6.8% robotic-assisted) cases were identified. Operative length was significantly higher in both the robotic-assisted RnYGB and SG cohorts (p < 0.0001). Outcomes were similar between the robotic-assisted and laparoscopic RnYGB cohorts, except a lower mortality rate (p = 0.05), transfusion requirement (p = 0.005), aggregate bleeding (p = 0.04), and surgical site infections (SSI) (p = 0.006) in the robotic-assisted cohort. Outcomes were also similar between robotic-assisted and laparoscopic SG, except for a longer length of stay (p < 0.0001) and higher rates of conversion (p < 0.0001), 30-day intervention (p = 0.01), operative drain present (p < 0.0001), sepsis (p = 0.01), and organ space SSI (p = 0.0002) in the robotic cohort. Bleeding was lower in the robotic SG cohort and mortality was similar. CONCLUSION: Both robotic-assisted and laparoscopic RnYGB and SG are overall very safe. Robotic-assisted gastric bypass is associated with a lower mortality and morbidity; however, a clear benefit for robotic-assisted SG compared to laparoscopic SG was not seen. Given the longer operative and hospital duration, robotic SG is not cost-effective.

But no study assesses the safety and efficacy of ESAs combined with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The aim of our study is to assess the efficacy and safety of ESAs combination with TCM for patients with CIA and will provide a higher level of evidence for clinical applications. METHODS: This protocol adheres to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis protocol statement. The source of literature will be a structured search of the following 7 electronic databases: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and Wanfang Database. Records will be independently evaluated by 2 reviewers. Disagreements will be resolved through consensus or third-party adjudication. Review Manager 5.3 software (Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen Denmark) will be used to perform meta-analysis. For dichotomous variables, odds ratio with 95% confidence intervals will be obtained by the Mantel–Haenszel method. For continuous data, mean difference with 95% confidence intervals will be used. P < 0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant. RESULTS: This study will be performed to test the efficacy and safety of ESAs combined with TCM for CIA in patients with cancer.

This article includes identification and description of the components of assay development, including formulas for calculating the number of positive serum samples needed for assay validation and methods for calculating their diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. To ensure that assays are performing within predetermined specifications, there must be a quality control system that includes appropriate system and sample suitability controls as well as mechanisms to track assay performance over time. The section on quality assurance includes definitions of precision and accuracy in assay performance, and how to interpret these two factors using the Levey-Jennings chart, Westgard's rules, and other monitoring methods. Because all serologic assays are prone to false positive and false negative results, it is essential to interpret all diagnostic test results using both the expected prevalence of disease in the population and the population-specific assay performance characteristics that are determined during assay validation. The discussion on interpreting diagnostic test results also includes guidelines for calculating the positive and negative predictive values of an assay and for interpreting results based on the disease prevalence of the test population.

As a result, RNA virus populations harbor a large amount of genetic diversity that confers them the ability to rapidly adapt to changes in their environment. In this work, we investigate whether further increasing the initial population diversity of a model RNA virus can improve adaptation to a single selection pressure, thermal inactivation. For this, we experimentally increased the diversity of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) populations across the capsid region. We then compared the ability of these high diversity CVB3 populations to achieve resistance to thermal inactivation relative to standard CVB3 populations in an experimental evolution setting. We find that viral populations with high diversity are better able to achieve resistance to thermal inactivation at both the temperature employed during experimental evolution as well as at a more extreme temperature. Moreover, we identify mutations in the CVB3 capsid that confer resistance to thermal inactivation, finding significant mutational epistasis. Our results indicate that even naturally diverse RNA virus populations can benefit from experimental augmentation of population diversity for optimal adaptation and support the use of such viral populations in directed evolution efforts that aim to select viruses with desired characteristics.","Mattenberger, Florian; Vila-Nistal, Marina; Geller, Ron",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7994910/,446

The metabolites of the KP, an important part of the microbiota-gut-brain axis, serve as immune system modulators linking the gut microbiota (GM) with the host central nervous system. Aim: This bibliometric analysis aimed to provide a first glimpse into the KP in MD, with a focus on GM research in this field, to guide future research and promote the development of this field. Methods: Publications relating to the KP in MD between the years 2000 and 2020 were retrieved from the Scopus and Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC), and analyzed in CiteSpace (5.7 R5W), biblioshiny (using R-Studio), and VOSviewer (1.6.16). Results: In total, 1,064 and 948 documents were extracted from the Scopus and WoSCC databases, respectively. The publications have shown rapid growth since 2006, partly owing to the largest research hotspot appearing since then, “quinolinic acid.” All the top five most relevant journals were in the neuropsychiatry field, such as Brain Behavior and Immunity. The United States and Innsbruck Medical University were the most influential country and institute, respectively. Journal co-citation analysis showed a strong tendency toward co-citation of research in the psychiatry field. Reference co-citation analysis revealed that the top four most important research focuses were “kynurenine pathway,” “psychoneuroimmunology,” “indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase,” and “proinflammatory cytokines,” and the most recent focus was “gut-brain axis,” thus indicating the role of the KP in bridging the GM and the host immune system, and together reflecting the field’s research foundations. Overlap analysis between the thematic map of keywords and the keyword burst analysis revealed that the topics “Alzheimer’s disease,” “prefrontal cortex,” and “acid,” were research frontiers. Conclusion: This comprehensive bibliometric study provides an updated perspective on research associated with the KP in MD, with a focus on the current status of GM research in this field. This perspective may benefit researchers in choosing suitable journals and collaborators, and aid in the further understanding of the field’s hotspots and frontiers, thus facilitating future research.","Zhu, Xiuqing; Hu, Jinqing; Deng, Shuhua; Tan, Yaqian; Qiu, Chang; Zhang, Ming; Ni, Xiaojia; Lu, Haoyang; Wang, Zhanzhang; Li, Lu; Luo, Yayan; Huang, Shanqing; Xiao, Tao; Liu, Shujing; Li, Xiaolin; Shang, Dewei; Wen, Yuguan",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8258344/,446

20099,"Patient–ventilator asynchrony, impact on clinical outcomes and effectiveness of interventions: a systematic review and meta-analysis",2021-08-16,"A healthy adipose tissue (AT) is indispensable to human wellbeing. Among other roles, it contributes to energy homeostasis and provides insulation for internal organs. Adipocytes were previously thought to be a passive store of excess calories, however this view evolved to include an endocrine role. Adipose tissue was shown to synthesize and secrete adipokines that are pertinent to glucose and lipid homeostasis, as well as inflammation. Importantly, the obesity-induced adipose tissue expansion stimulates a plethora of signals capable of triggering an inflammatory response. These inflammatory manifestations of obese AT have been linked to insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes, and proposed to evoke obesity-induced comorbidities including cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). A growing body of evidence suggests that metabolic disorders, characterized by AT inflammation and accumulation around organs may eventually induce organ dysfunction through a direct local mechanism. Interestingly, perirenal adipose tissue (PRAT), surrounding the kidney, influences renal function and metabolism. In this regard, PRAT emerged as an independent risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD) and is even correlated with CVD. Here, we review the available evidence on the impact of PRAT alteration in different metabolic states on the renal and cardiovascular function. We present a broad overview of novel insights linking cardiovascular derangements and CKD with a focus on metabolic disorders affecting PRAT. We also argue that the confluence among these pathways may open several perspectives for future pharmacological therapies against CKD and CVD possibly by modulating PRAT immunometabolism.","Hammoud, Safaa H.; AlZaim, Ibrahim; Al-Dhaheri, Yusra; Eid, Ali H.; El-Yazbi, Ahmed F.",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8366229/,446
20261,Postoperative 20% albumin vs standard care and acute kidney injury after high-risk cardiac surgery (ALBICS): study protocol for a randomised trial,2021-08-21,"BACKGROUND: Existing studies show that consuming food consistent with one’s culture reduces cardiometabolic risk. However, few studies have assessed whether these dietary choices influence sleep health. Accordingly, this study assessed how Mexican food consumption by individuals of Mexican descent residing at the US-Mexico border, was associated with various measures of sleep, after accounting for acculturation. METHODS: Data were provided by 100 adults between the ages of 18–60, in the city of Nogales, AZ. Questionnaires were provided in either Spanish or English. Acculturation was assessed with the Acculturation Scale for Mexican-Americans (ARSMA-II), with an additional question, asking how often “my family cooks Mexican foods.” Frequency of cooking Mexican food was coded as either “yes” or “no.” Sleep was assessed, using validated measures that include the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and sleep duration with the item “how many hours of actual sleep did you get at night?” Regression models estimated the associations between sleep health variables as outcomes and consumption of Mexican food as the independent variable. Covariates included age, sex, and acculturation scores. Parental education level was also included, as an indicator of childhood socioeconomic status and since food culture likely involves parents. RESULT: We found that among individuals who identified as Mexican-Americans who consumed culturally-consistent foods, was associated with, on average, 1.41 more hours of sleep (95% CI 0.19, 2.62; p = 0.024) and were less likely to report snoring (OR: 0.25; 95% CI 0.07, 0.93; p = 0.039). Consuming Mexican food was not associated with sleep quality, insomnia severity or sleepiness. CONCLUSION: Individuals of Mexican descent residing at the US-Mexico border who regularly consumed Mexican food, reported more sleep and less snoring. Mexican acculturation has been shown previously to improve sleep health. This is likely due to consumption of a culturally- consistent diet. Future studies should examine the role of acculturation in sleep health, dietary choices, and subsequent cardiometabolic risk.","Ghani, Sadia B.; Taneja, Krishna; Wills, Chloe C.

20303,The Japanese Clinical Practice Guidelines for Management of Sepsis and Septic Shock 2020 (J-SSCG 2020),2021-08-25,"Pertussis (whooping cough) epidemics persist globally despite high vaccine coverage among infants and young children. The resurgence of pertussis in high-income countries is partly due to waning vaccine immunity, resulting in a pool of unprotected adolescents and adults. However, pertussis is generally less severe in adolescents and adults, and this difference in presentation means it can often be unrecognised by healthcare professionals, meaning that it is largely under-diagnosed in older populations. A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE and BIOSIS was undertaken to identify studies published between 1 January 1990 and 17 June 2019, with information on pertussis epidemiology and mortality in school-aged children, adolescents and adults in Europe. A formal statistical comparison (e.g. using meta-analyses) was not possible because of the mix of methodologies reported. There were 69 epidemiological studies and 19 mortality studies identified for review. Over the past decade, the reported incidence of notified pertussis cases varied widely between European countries, which is likely associated with differences in surveillance systems, diagnostic techniques and reporting regulations. However, several studies show that pertussis is circulating among adolescents and adults in Europe, and although pertussis-related morbidity and mortality are highest in infants, there is evidence that adults aged > 50 years are at increased risk. For example, in a hospital-based surveillance study in Portugal, between 2000 and 2015, 94% of hospitalised pertussis cases were infants aged < 1 year, with a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.8%; however, among hospitalised adult cases of pertussis, the CFRs were 11.5% (aged 18–64 years) and 17.4% (aged > 65 years). Very few European countries currently include pertussis boosters for adults in the national immunisation strategy.

This narrative review aims to present updated information about the use of natural bioactive compounds for the prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections. A search of the literature was performed using databases and search engines such as PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and Science Direct. From the pharmacotherapeutic management point of view, any strategies for prevention should contain medical approaches. The bioactive compounds obtained from natural products have shown biological effects against different microorganisms for the treatment of these diseases. The main results showed antimicrobial, antiprotozoal, antifungal and antiviral effects such as HIV. Also, the molecular mechanisms, signalling pathways and action targets of natural compounds were highlighted, thus justifying bacterial and antifungal inhibition, apoptosis or reduction of viral replication. From the data of our study, we can conclude that natural compounds may be a significant source for adjuvant drugs / complementary therapies in the treatment of STDs. With all these benefits, the future must conduct extensive clinical trials and the development of pharmaceutical nanotechnologies for a greater therapeutic effect.","Sharifi-Rad, Javad; Quispe, Cristina; Rahavian, Amirhossein; Pereira Carneiro, Joara Nályda; Rocha, Janaína Esmeraldo; Alves Borges Leal, Antônio Linkoln; Bezerra Morais Braga, Maria Flaviana; Melo Coutinho, Henrique Douglas; Ansari Djafari, Anahita; Alarcón-Zapata, Pedro; Martorell, Miquel; Antika, Gizem; Tumer, Tugba Boyunegmez; Cruz-Martins, Natália; Helon, Paweł; Paprocka, Paulina; Koch, Wojciech; Docea, Anca Oana; Calina, Daniela",Front Pharmacol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8421529/,446
23851,"Severe Malaria: Manifestations, diagnosis, chemotherapy, and management of severe malaria in adults",2005,"Infectious diseases continue to be the major causes of illness, disability, and death. Moreover, in recent years, new infectious agents and diseases are being identified, and some diseases that were previously considered under control have reemerged. Furthermore, antimicrobial resistance has grown rapidly in a variety of hospital as well as community acquired infections. Thus, humanity still faces big challenges in the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Vaccination, generally considered to be the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases, works by presenting a foreign antigen to the immune system to evoke an immune response. The administered antigen can either be a live, but weakened, form of a pathogen (bacteria or virus), a killed or inactivated form of the pathogen, or a purified material such as a protein. However, no vaccine is completely safe; therefore, vaccine safety research and monitoring are necessary to minimize vaccine related harms. From the formulation point of view, the goal continues to be to improve the quality and global availability of vaccine delivery systems. This chapter provides an introduction to vaccine formulation, describes the delivery routes that are utilized, and discusses the factors that affect the safety and stability of a vaccine formulation.","Şenel, Sevda",Fundamentals and Applications of Controlled Release Drug Delivery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7119968/,446

Simulation has been applied as a strategy to identify system gaps and safety threats with the goal to mitigate risk and improve patient outcomes. Early in the pre-construction phase of design development for a new free-standing children’s hospital, Simulation-based Hospital Design Testing (SbHDT) was conducted in a full-scale mock-up. This allowed healthcare teams and architects to actively witness care providing an avenue to study the interaction of humans with their environment, enabling effectively identification of latent conditions that may lay dormant in proposed design features. In order to successfully identify latent conditions in the physical environment and understand the impact of those latent conditions, a specific debriefing framework focused on the built environment was developed and implemented. This article provides a rationale for an approach to debriefing that specifically focuses on the built environment and describes SAFEE, a debriefing guide for simulationists looking to conduct SbHDT.","Colman, Nora; Dalpiaz, Ashley; Walter, Sarah; Chambers, Misty S.; Hebbar, Kiran B.",Adv Simul (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7384892/,446

Spotify has developed its own Agile culture to facilitate software development for hundreds of developers across multiple cities. The Spotify model has become influential among agile proponents and hence formed the basis of methods used in other organisations. We have identified a lack of research into agile architecture using the Spotify model. To explore How can architectural governance increase the autonomy of teams when using the Spotify model?, an intervention embedded case study was conducted in a multinational FinTech organisation, using the Spotify model. New processes were introduced by developing and evaluating an approach to Agile architectural governance. This approach incorporates a structural change and a change management process. We conducted 6 semi-structured open-ended interviews and direct observations of Agile practices. The collected data was analysed using Thematic Analysis and informed by some Grounded Theory techniques. The practitioners in our study report benefits of this evaluated approach. These benefits include transforming architectural based decision into decentralised based decision-making, strengthening the autonomy of squads through aligning architectural based decisions, sharing the architectural knowledge among the squads, and other benefits. We identify the characteristics and benefits of our evaluated approach to Agile architectural governance using the Spotify model. Also, we identify guidelines and challenges for those wishing to adopt this approach.","Salameh, Abdallah; Bass, Julian M.",Agile Processes in Software Engineering and Extreme Programming - Workshops,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7510810/,446

Nevertheless, debates have been poorly attuned to geography and history. Calls for reinvigorated domestic manufacturing conceal the degree to which industrial landscapes are already entwined in geometries of power. This is especially so at ports—increasingly privatised—that have become sites of policy focus and biosecurity panic. Crucial trading zones, ports are being refashioned as growth machines for commodity export, energy, and logistics, undergirding national manufacturing capacity via trade and material commodity flows. Yet ports have also always been vectors for disease transmission and are central places for COVID‐19 crises. Writing from Port Kembla, south of Sydney, Australia, we catalogue five themes warranting geographical analysis and global comparison in light of coronavirus: disruptions to supply chains (with implications for global production networks); domestic industrial capacity and the future of manufacturing; biosecuring industrial sites; precarious labour and work; and vernacular emergency response capacities within industrial communities. Amidst heightened geopolitical tensions, geographers reveal how industrial landscapes are contested. Logistical and biosecurity roles are enveloped by enduring infrastructural materialities, local histories, and regional legacies of skill and ingenuity.","Gibson, Chris; Carr, Chantel; Lyons, Craig; Taksa, Lucy; Warren, Andrew",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8014100/,446

AIMS This study focuses on socio-economic inequalities in social network, loneliness and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS Two-hundred and fourteen residents of Wandsworth, a South West London Borough in the United Kingdom completed an online cross-sectional survey on the impact of COVID-19 on mental health. Data were analysed using independent samples t-tests and multiple regression. RESULTS Middle-aged people reported a less strong social network and more loneliness, anxiety and depression than younger people. People with a long-term health condition reported a less strong social network, more loneliness, more general practitioner (GP) and hospital visits, and poorer mental health than those with no long-term health conditions. People receiving State financial benefits reported less use of public spaces, a less strong social network, more loneliness, more GP and hospital visits and poorer mental health than those not receiving benefits. Greater neighbourhood identification was associated with a stronger social network and better mental health outcomes. Multiple regression analyses showed that, over and above loneliness, perceived personal risk of COVID-19 constitutes an additional precipitant for both depression and anxiety when controlling for other variables. CONCLUSION As a novel stressor associated with the pandemic, the situational and involuntary perception of being at risk of COVID-19 may be stimulating anxiety and depressive symptomatology, which will need to be managed effectively as resurgences of the disease are predicted and communicated to the general public under growing mistrust and uncertainty.","Jaspal, Rusi; Breakwell, Glynis M",The International journal of social psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1177/0020764020976694; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33287610/,446
65872,Intraoperative electroencephalogram suppression at lower volatile anaesthetic concentrations predicts postoperative delirium occurring in the intensive care unit.,2018,"Clinical performance of a biomaterial is decided early after implantation as leukocytes interrogate the graft throughout acute inflammation. High degrees of leukocyte activation lead to poor material/patient compliance, accelerated degeneration and graft rejection. A number reactive oxygen species (ROS) are released by leukocytes throughout their interaction with a material, which can be used as a sensitive measure of leukocyte activation. The aim of this study was to compare leukocyte activation by commercially available biologic surgical materials and define the extent manufacturing variables influence down-stream ROS response. Chemiluminescence assays were performed using modifications to a commercially available kit (Knight Scientific, UK). Whole blood was obtained from 4 healthy human adults at 7 day intervals for 4 weeks, combined with Adjuvant K, Pholasin (a highly sensitive ROS excitable photoprotein) and biomaterial, and incubated for 60 min with continuous chemiluminescent measurements. Leukocyte ROS inducers fMLP and PMA were added as controls. Xeno- and allogeneic dermal and small intestinal submucosal (SIS) derived biomaterials were produced commercially (Surgisis Biodesign™, Alloderm(®), Strattice(®)Firm & Pliable & Permacol™) or fabricated in house to induce variations in decellularisation and cross-linking. Statistics were performed using Waller-Duncan post hoc ranking. Materials demonstrated significant differences in leukocyte activation as a function of decellularisation reagent and tissue origin. The data demonstrated SIS was significantly more pro-inflammatory than dermis. Additionally it was deduced that SDS during decellularisation induced pro-inflammatory changes to dermal materials. Furthermore, it was possible to conclude inter-patient variation in leukocyte response. The in vitro findings were validated in vivo which confirmed the chemiluminescence observations, highlighting the potential for translation of this technique as a routine component of pre-surgical evaluation to maximise foreign body compliance.","Bryan, Nicholas; Ashwin, Helen; Smart, Neil; Bayon, Yves; Scarborough, Nelson; Hunt, John A",Biomaterials,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2012.05.058; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22738779/,446

Commonly segmented thoracic OARs include the heart, esophagus, spinal cord, and lungs. This study evaluated a convolutional neural network (CNN) for automatic segmentation of these OARs. METHODS The dataset was created retrospectively from consecutive radiotherapy plans containing all five OARs of interest, including 22,411 CT slices from 168 patients. Patients were divided into training, validation, and test datasets according to a 66%/17%/17% split. We trained a modified U-Net, applying transfer learning from a VGG16 image classification model trained on ImageNet. The Dice coefficient and 95% Hausdorff distance on the test set for each organ was compared to a commercial atlas-based segmentation model using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS On the test dataset, the median Dice coefficients for the CNN model vs. the multi-atlas model were 71% vs. 67% for the spinal cord, 96% vs. 94% for the right lung, 96%vs. 94% for the left lung, 91% vs. 85% for the heart, and 63% vs. 37% for the esophagus. The median 95% Hausdorff distances were 9.5 mm vs. 25.3 mm, 5.1 mm vs. 8.1 mm, 4.0 mm vs. 8.0 mm, 9.8 mm vs. 15.8 mm, and 9.2 mm vs. 20.0 mm for the respective organs. The results all favored the CNN model (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS A 2D CNN can achieve superior results to commercial atlas-based software for OAR segmentation utilizing non-domain transfer learning, which has potential utility for quality assurance and expediting patient care.","Vu, Charles C; Siddiqui, Zaid A; Zamdborg, Leonid; Thompson, Andrew B; Quinn, Thomas J; Castillo, Edward; Guerrero, Thomas M",Journal of applied clinical medical physics,https://doi.org/10.1002/acm2.12871; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32602187/,446

Recent literature shows online electives may provide an alternative learning platform. We developed a tele-ophthalmology student elective for rising third-year (MS3) and fourth-year (MS4) medical students to continue teaching and exposure to the field. Methods A 4-week remote elective was approved by Emory University School of Medicine and offered between April 18, 2020 to May 15, 2020 for rising MS3 and MS4 students. The curriculum consisted of online self-study materials, student presentations, chart review assignments, case-based discussions with faculty, and telehealth experiences. All students were surveyed and tested with questions from USMLE World (UWorld) test bank at the end of the course. Results A total of 18 students enrolled, with 66.7% MS3 and 33.3% MS4 participance. The mean rating of fulfillment of course learning objectives was 8.1/10 (range, 6.7-8.8), with mean ratings of 8.2 for MS3s and 7.7 for MS4s. There was a significant increase in self-reported knowledge in ophthalmology, with an increase from 4.6 to 8.1 for MS3s (p=0.002) and 6.7 to 8.0 for MS4s (p=0.04). Students also reported higher interest in the field, with an increase from 4.9 to 7.8 for MS3s (p=0.01) and 7.5 to 8.7 for MS4s (p=0.1). The students performed significantly higher on the post-course test (94.8%) than UWorld question bank users (74.1%) (p<0.001). Conclusion Our novel ophthalmology elective significantly enhanced self-reported medical student knowledge and interest in the field during a crisis that required transition to remote learning.

Energy-based devices and Ultrasonic dissectors are used with a lot of factors in play-including ergonomics and economics during surgery. Here an attempt is based to review the surgical efficacy and safety of these dissectors with importance to plume production and lateral thermal damage. The factors contributing to adversities to the dissectors are also to be noted. The strategy adopted was aimed at finding relevant studies from PubMed from 1995 to 2014. The basic principle of plume production and thermal damage are studied in this review. Factors contributing to the same that can lead to adversities during laparoscopic surgeries are identified. Summarizing key points that increase lateral thermal damage and plume production amongst different ultrasonic shears and suggesting a technique to identify the right balance between the existing dissectors was possible. The RF Device and USS are both useful and widely used and are more safer than monopolar devices. RF Device is considerably slower than USS, as it cannot achieve coagulation and cutting at the same time. Although USS definitely improvises dissection and has less thermal injury than RF Device, the clinical implications in balancing dissection efficacy with hemostasis need to be investigated further. The ideal haemostatic energy-based shear device would be one with excellent hemostatic results and visual acuity while allowing none or minimal thermal energy escape at the point of application. In our current setting, a combined use of both RF and USS device usage as applied in the particular situations has potential.","Devassy, Rajesh; Gopalakrishnan, Sreelatha; De Wilde, Rudy Leon",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology of India,https://doi.org/10.1007/s13224-015-0774-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26405398/,446

MATERIALS AND METHODS Between January 2009 and November 2017, all patients with premorbid mRS 3 or 4 undergoing mechanical thrombectomy due to anterior circulation stroke were selected. Good outcome was defined as a clinical recovery to the status before stroke onset (ie, equal premorbid mRS and mRS at 90 days). In addition, mortality at discharge and at 90 days was analyzed. RESULTS One hundred thirty-six patients were included, of whom 81.6% presented with premorbid mRS 3; and 18.4%, with premorbid mRS 4; 24.0% of patients with premorbid mRS 4 achieved clinical recovery compared with 20.7% of patients with premorbid mRS 3 (P = .788). However, the proportion of hospital mortality and mortality at 90 days was nonsignificant, but markedly higher in patients with premorbid mRS 4. Multivariate analysis identified low NIHSS scores (OR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85-0.99; P = .040), high ASPECTS (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.02-2.16; P = .049), and TICI 2b-3 (OR, 7.11; 95% CI, 1.73-49.90; P = .017) as independent predictors of good outcome. CONCLUSIONS Good outcome in patients with premorbid mRS 3 and 4 is less frequent compared with premorbid mRS 0-2. Nevertheless, about 20% of the patients return to their premorbid mRS, which may justify endovascular treatment. The most important predictor of good outcome is successful recanalization.","Seker, F; Pfaff, J; Schönenberger, S; Herweh, C; Nagel, S; Ringleb, P A; Bendszus, M; Möhlenbruch, M A",AJNR.

Egypt is among the five countries reporting the highest number of cases in Africa. Aims We aimed to provide an overview of the epidemic features of COVID-19 in Egypt in order to help guide an effective lockdown-exit strategy. Methods The incidence proportions, case fatality rates (CFR), growth rates, doubling time (Td), basic reproductive number (R0) and Herd Immunity Threshold (HIT) were calculated weekly and reviewed. Results As of 21 May 2020, the epidemic growth rate and R0 have decreased significantly; the averages (±SD) were 0.35 (±0.33) and 2.6 (±1.55) respectively. However, the incidence proportion has increased to 14 cases /100 000 population. Conclusion COVID-19 transmissibility has declined but the incidence rate has increased, underscoring that any lockdown-exit strategy should include measures to strengthen physical distancing, and case-based interventions to prevent an uncontrolled upsurge of COVID-19 cases.","Radwan, Ghada Nasr",Eastern Mediterranean health journal = La revue de sante de la Mediterranee orientale = al-Majallah al-sihhiyah li-sharq al-mutawassit,https://doi.org/10.26719/emhj.20.084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32794161/,446
82539,Suicide risk with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and other new-generation antidepressants in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.,2021-03-08,"This study examined the humoral and cellular response of cattle vaccinated with two commercial leptospiral vaccines, Leptavoid and Spirovac, and a novel bacterin vaccine using Seppic Montanide oil emulsion adjuvant. Vaccination was followed by experimental challenge. All vaccinated cattle were protected from colonization of the kidney and shedding of Leptospira in urine, as detected by culture and immunofluorescence assay. Agglutinating antibody titers were detected in vaccinated cattle at 4 weeks following vaccination, with small anamnestic response detected following experimental challenge. Only animals vaccinated with the oil emulsion-adjuvanted bacterin produced significant IgG2 titers following vaccination, and nonvaccinated animals produced serum IgA titers after experimental challenge. CD4+ and γδ T cells from vaccinated cattle proliferated when cultured with antigen ex vivo Cellular responses included a marked proliferation of γδ T cells immediately following experimental challenge in vaccinated cattle and release of gamma interferon (IFN-γ), interleukin 17a (IL-17a), and IL-12p40 from stimulated cells. Proliferative and cytokine responses were found not just in peripheral mononuclear cells but also in lymphocytes isolated from renal lymph nodes at 10 weeks following experimental challenge. Overall, effects of leptospirosis vaccination and infection were subtle, resulting in only modest activation of CD4+ and γδ T cells. The use of Seppic Montanide oil emulsion adjuvants may shorten the initiation of response to vaccination, which could be useful during outbreaks or in areas where leptospirosis is endemic.IMPORTANCE Leptospirosis is an underdiagnosed, underreported zoonotic disease of which domestic livestock can be carriers. As a reservoir host for Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Hardjo, cattle may present with reproductive issues, including abortion, birth of weak or infected calves, or failure to breed. Despite years of study and the availability of commercial vaccines, detailed analysis of the bovine immune response to vaccination and Leptospira challenge is lacking. This study evaluated immunologic responses to two efficacious commercial vaccines and a novel bacterin vaccine using an adjuvant chosen for enhanced cellular immune responses. Antigen-specific responsive CD4 and γδ T cells were detected following vaccination and were associated with release of inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ and IL-17a after stimulation. CD4 and γδ cells increased in the first week after infection and, combined with serum antibody, may play a role in clearance of bacteria from the blood and resident tissues. Additionally, these antigen-reactive T cells were found in the regional lymph nodes following infection, indicating that memory responses may not be circulating but are still present in regional lymph nodes. The information gained in this study expands knowledge of bovine immune response to leptospirosis vaccines and infection. The use of oil emulsion adjuvants may enhance early immune responses to leptospiral bacterins, which could be useful in outbreaks or situations where leptospirosis is endemic.","Wilson-Welder, Jennifer H; Alt, David P; Nally, Jarlath E; Olsen, Steven C",mSphere,https://doi.org/10.1128/msphere.00988-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33762318/,446

Connected health (CH) may facilitate cancer care. The objective of the present study was to systematically review CH for families/informal caregivers affected by paediatric cancer. METHODS Using search terms relating to: (1) paediatric cancer, (2) family/caregivers, and (3) CH, the databases of PsycINFO, Pubmed, EMBASE and Web of Science were searched. Inclusion criteria included an evaluation of CH technologies for supportive care for families/caregivers affected by paediatric cancer at any stage of treatment or survivorship. RESULTS Sixteen studies met inclusion criteria. CH was primarily web-based (n=6), however smartphone applications (n=5), telehealth (n=2) and online groups (n=3) were utilised. Intervention areas included psycho-social (n=6), health and information provision (n=8) and palliative care (n=2). CONCLUSIONS While limited studies have evaluated the impact of CH on families living with paediatric cancer, emerging evidence suggests potential benefits.

83410,Extracorporeal Carbon Dioxide Removal: From Bench to Bedside and Back.,2020-12-01,"BACKGROUND Radiation-induced nephropathy is still dose limiting in radionuclide therapy of neuroendocrine tumors. We investigated the nephroprotective potential of the angiotensine converting enzyme inhibiting drug enalpril after [177Lu]-DOTATATE therapy in a murine model of radiation-induced nephropathy by renal scintigraphy. At first, the appropriate therapy activity to induce nephropathy was identified. Baseline scintigraphy (n = 12) entailed 12-min dynamic acquisitions after injection of 25 MBq [99mTc]-MAG3, which was followed by radionuclide therapy at four escalating activities of [177Lu]-DOTATATE: group (Gp) 1: 10 MBq; Gp 2: 20 MBq; Gp 3: 40 MBq; Gp 4: 65 MBq. Follow-up [99mTc]-MAG3 scintigraphy was carried out at days 9, 23, 44, and 65. The treatment activity for the intervention arm was selected on the basis of histological examination and declining renal function. In the second part, daily administration by gavage of 10 mg/kg/d enalapril or water (control group) was initiated on the day of radionuclide therapy. Follow-up scintigraphy was carried out at days 9, 23, 44, 65, and 86. We also created a non-therapy control group to detect therapy-independent changes of renal function over time. For all scintigraphies, mean renogram curves were analyzed and the ""fractional uptake rate"" (FUR; %I.D./min ± SEM) of the tracer by the kidneys was calculated as an index of renal clearance. RESULTS At day 65 of follow-up, no significant change in the FUR relative to baseline (11.0 ± 0.3) was evident in radionuclide therapy groups 1 (11.2 ± 0.5) and 2 (10.1 ± 0.6), but FUR was significantly reduced in groups 3 (8.93 ± 0.6, p < 0.05) and 4 (6.0 ± 0.8, p < 0.01); we chose 40 MBq [177Lu]-DOTATATE (Gp 3) for the intervention study. Here, at the last day of follow-up (day 86), FUR was unaltered in enalapril-treated mice (11.8 ± 0.5) relative to the baseline group (12.4 ± 0.3) and non-therapy group (11.9 ± 0.8), whereas FUR in the control group had undergone a significant decline (9.3 ± 0.5; p < 0.01). Histological examination revealed prevention of kidney damage by enalapril treatment. CONCLUSIONS Treatment with enalapril is effective for nephroprotection during radionuclide therapy with [177Lu]-DOTATATE in mice. Although these results are only limitedly transferable to human studies, enalapril might serve as a promising drug in the mitigation of nephropathy following treatment with [177Lu]-DOTATATE.","Ilhan, Harun; Wang, Hao; Gildehaus, Franz J; Wängler, Carmen; Herrler, Tanja; Todica, Andrei; Schlichtiger, Julia; Cumming, Paul; Bartenstein, Peter; Hacker, Marcus; Haug, Alexander R",EJNMMI research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13550-016-0219-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27515447/,446
83571,Admission chest CT score predicts 5-day outcome in patients with COVID-19.,2020-05-28,"BACKGROUND The traditional approach to a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass is to construct the biliopancreatic and Roux limbs within the inframesocolic space. This requires reflecting the greater omentum, transverse colon, and mesocolon superiorly. This maneuver can be challenging in patients with a robust omentum, hepatomegaly, or significant omental adhesions. The inability to fully reflect the omentum superiorly prevents an appropriate view of the posterior transverse mesocolon and the inframesocolic space from being obtained. This can make it difficult to construct the biliopancreatic and Roux limbs. In order to circumvent the difficult situations described above, a supramesocolic approach to constructing the biliopancreatic and Roux limbs can be performed. This approach avoids the need to reflect the omentum and transverse colon. METHODS Key steps include entering the lesser sac by transecting the gastrocolic ligament and, next, an aperture in the transverse mesocolon made exposing the ligament of Treitz. The small bowel is then eviscerated into the supramesocolic space. The biliopancreatic and Roux limbs are then created in the usual fashion. All of the small bowel except the Roux limb is then returned through the mesocolon to the inframesocolic space. Peterson's space and the mesocolic defect are then closed using permanent suture. The remainder of the procedure is then performed in the usual fashion. RESULTS No complications were reported immediately postoperatively or at a 12-month follow-up in all 3 cases. CONCLUSION The supramesocolic approach to a Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass is a safe and effective technique when an inframesocolic approach proves difficult.","Dugan, Nicholas; Nimeri, Abdelrahman",Obesity surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11695-020-04937-y; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32839929/,446

Caring for patients with dementia suffering from COVID-19 is challenging due to unclear symptom presentation, delirium, and maintaining isolation procedures. CASE PRESENTATION A man in his sixties with dementia, hospitalised in a psychogeriatric ward, presented with mild upper respiratory tract symptoms and recovered within 24 hours. Ten days later he developed more severe symptoms. PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. Over the following two months his clinical state fluctuated, from almost symptom-free days to being bedridden and assessed as potentially terminal. After the initial positive test, he had three consecutive negative tests, before he again tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Uncertainty as to whether the patient remained contagious resulted in isolation of the patient for over two months. INTERPRETATION PCR testing of SARS-CoV-2 does not differentiate between intact virus and remnants thereof, and patients may test positive for a long time. This along with a fluctuating clinical course makes it difficult for clinicians to decide when to end isolation of COVID-19 patients.","Aakhus, Eivind; Finbråten, Elena H; Finnes, Trine; Dons, Tine Smedsund; Borza, Tom","Tidsskrift for den Norske laegeforening : tidsskrift for praktisk medicin, ny raekke",https://doi.org/10.4045/tidsskr.20.0566; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33070603/,446
87392,Inspection and polypectomy during both insertion and withdrawal or only during withdrawal of colonoscopy?: A protocol for systematic review and meta analysis.,2020-07-02,"Rheumatologists increasingly receive consults for patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) for cancer. ICIs can cause inflammatory syndromes known as immune-related adverse events (irAEs). Several rheumatologic irAEs are reported including inflammatory arthritis, polymyalgia rheumatica, and myositis. For patients who present with musculoskeletal symptoms while on ICI therapy, it is important to have an algorithm for evaluation. The differential diagnosis includes a range of musculoskeletal syndromes like crystalline arthritis, mechanical issues, and osteoarthritis, in addition to irAEs. After diagnosing a rheumatologic irAE, rheumatologists must work with the patient and their oncologist to form a treatment plan. Treatment of irAEs is guided by severity. Evidence for management is limited to observational studies. Inflammatory arthritis and polymyalgia rheumatica are treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in mild cases, corticosteroids for moderate to severe cases, and sometimes require other disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs. Myositis due to ICIs can be accompanied by myocarditis or myasthenia gravis. Corticosteroids and holding the ICI are usually required to treat myositis; some patients with severe myositis need intravenous immunoglobulin or plasmapheresis. Further research is needed to optimize treatment of irAEs that does not compromise the anti-tumor effect of ICIs.","Cappelli, Laura C; Bingham, Clifton O",Arthritis & rheumatology,https://doi.org/10.1002/art.41587; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33186490/,446
87393,Fresh whole blood from walking blood banks for patients with traumatic hemorrhagic shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2020-06-24,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is often associated with scarring and cavity formation and therefore bridging strategies are essential to provide a physical substrate for axonal regeneration. In this study we investigated the effects of a biodegradable conduit made from trimethylene carbonate and ε-caprolactone (TC) containing poly-p-dioxanone microfilaments (PDO) with longitudinal grooves on regeneration after SCI in adult rats. In vitro studies demonstrated that different cell types including astrocytes, meningeal fibroblasts, Schwann cells and adult sensory dorsal root ganglia neurons can grow on the TC and PDO material. For in vivo experiments, the TC/PDO conduit was implanted into a small 2-3 mm long cavity in the C3-C4 cervical segments immediately after injury (acute SCI) or at 2-5 months after initial surgery (chronic SCI). At 8 weeks after implantation into acute SCI, numerous 5HT-positive descending raphaespinal axons and sensory CGRP-positive axons regenerated across the conduit and were often associated with PDO microfilaments and migrated host cells. Implantation into chronically injured SCI induced regeneration mainly of the sensory CGRP-positive axons. Although the conduit had no effect on the density of OX42-positive microglial cells when compared with SCI control, the activity of GFAP-positive astrocytes was reduced. The results suggest that a TC/PDO conduit can support axonal regeneration after acute and chronic SCI even without addition of exogenous glial or stem cells. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE Biosynthetic conduits can support regeneration after spinal cord injury but often require addition of cell therapy and neurotrophic factors. This study demonstrates that biodegradable conduits made from trimethylene carbonate and ε-caprolactone with poly-p-dioxanone microfilaments alone can promote migration of different host cells and stimulate axonal regeneration after implantation into acute and chronic spinal cord injury. These results can be used to develop biosynthetic conduits for future clinical applications.","Novikova, Liudmila N; Kolar, Mallappa K; Kingham, Paul J; Ullrich, Andreas; Oberhoffner, Sven; Renardy, Monika; Doser, Michael; Müller, Erhard; Wiberg, Mikael; Novikov, Lev N",Acta biomaterialia,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actbio.2017.11.028; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29174588/,446

Colon is thought to be the first organ suffering from inflammation under HFD conditions due to the pro-inflammatory macrophages infiltration, however, the mechanisms concerning the induction of pro-inflammatory phenotype of colonic macrophages remains unclear. In this study, we show that HFD increased the percentage of gram-positive bacteria, especially genus Clostridium, and resulted in the significant increment of fecal deoxycholic acid (DCA), a gut microbial metabolite produced by bacteria mainly restricted to genus Clostridium. Notably, reducing gram-positive bacteria with vancomycin diminished fecal DCA and profoundly alleviated pro-inflammatory macrophage infiltration in colon, whereas DCA-supplemented feedings to vancomycin-treated mice provoked obvious pro-inflammatory macrophage infiltration and colonic inflammation. Meanwhile, intra-peritoneal administration of DCA also elicited considerable recruitment of macrophages with pro-inflammatory phenotype. Mechanistically, DCA dose-dependently promoted M1 macrophage polarization and pro-inflammatory cytokines production at least partially through toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) transactivated by M2 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M2-mAchR)/Src pathway. In addition, M2-mAchR mediated increase of TLR2 transcription was mainly achieved via targeting AP-1 transcription factor. Moreover, NF-κB/ERK/JNK signalings downstream of TLR2 are involved in the DCA-induced macrophage polarization. In conclusion, our findings revealed that high level DCA induced by HFD may serve as an initiator to activate macrophages and drive colonic inflammation, thus offer a mechanistic basis that modulation of gut microbiota or intervening specific bile acid receptor signaling could be potential therapeutic approaches for HFD-related inflammatory diseases.","Wang, Lingyu; Gong, Zizhen; Zhang, Xiuyuan; Zhu, Fangxinxing; Liu, Yuchen; Jin, Chaozhi; Du, Xixi; Xu, Congfeng; Chen, Yingwei; Cai, Wei; Tian, Chunyan; Wu, Jin",Gut microbes,https://doi.org/10.1080/19490976.2020.1819155; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33006494/,446
88908,Does this recent randomised controlled trial of intermittent pneumatic compression devices really indicate that they are ineffective in critical care patients?,2019,"INTRODUCTION Our aim was to describe our early experience with laparoendoscopic single-site surgery (LESS) via the retroperitoneal approach for upper urinary tract tumors. METHODS Since April 2010, 21 patients with upper urinary tract cell carcinoma were treated by our team: 12 patients have undergone LESS nephroureterectomy and 9 have undergone standard retroperitoneal laparoscopic surgery. In our LESS procedure, we employed a bendable grasper in the non-dominant hand and a standard straight laparoscopic instrument in the dominant hand. Nephrectomy was performed using procedures similar to those of conventional laparoscopic nephrectomy. In standard laparoscopic nephroureterectomy, the distal ureter and bladder cuff were excised by using the open method. RESULTS All operations using retroperitoneal LESS nephroureterectomy were completed without conversion to standard laparoscopy or open surgery. No intraoperative or acute postoperative complications occurred. We compared the results of the retroperitoneal single-port laparoscopic surgery group to the standard retroperitoneal laparoscopic surgery group and found that the retroperitoneal LESS nephroureterectomy had significantly less estimated blood loss (P = 0.034). No significant difference was noted with respect to age, BMI, operation time, time to oral intake, length of hospitalization, and the visual analog pain scale score at discharge ( P > 0.05). CONCLUSION The initial reports of retroperitoneal LESS nephroureterectomy demonstrate that the technique is a safe and feasible procedure for upper urinary tract urothelial carcinoma.","Okegawa, Takatsugu; Itaya, Naoshi; Hara, Hidehiko; Nutahara, Kikuo; Higashihara, Eiji",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1758-5910.2012.00146.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22805304/,446

METHODS We reviewed 20 lumbar sympathectomies performed in our vascular unit for plantar hyperhidrosis in 10 patients from 2011 and 2014. Demographics and outcomes were analyzed and a review of the literature conducted. RESULTS All procedures were carried out endoscopically with no intraoperative or postoperative morbidity. Plantar anhidrosis was achieved in all the patients, although two patients (20%) suffered a relapse. Unwanted side-effects occurred in the form of compensatory sweating in three patients (30%) and post-sympathectomy neuralgia in two patients (20%). None of the patients experienced sexual dysfunction. CONCLUSION Management of plantar hyperhidrosis may be based upon a therapeutic ladder starting with conservative measures and working up to surgery depending on the severity of the disease. Minimally invasive (endoscopic) sympathectomy for the thoracic chain is well established, but minimally invasive sympathectomy for the lumbar chain is a relatively new technique.

However, CVC insertion is associated with inevitable risks for various adverse events. Whether ultrasound guidance decreases the risk of catheter-related infection remains unclear. METHODS We observed 395 consecutive CVC insertions between April 2009 and January 2013 in our hematological oncology unit. Because the routine use of ultrasound guidance upon CVC insertion was adopted based on our hospital guidelines implemented after 2012, the research period was divided into before December 2011 (early term) and after January 2012 (late term). RESULTS Underlying diseases included hematological malignancies and immunological disorders. In total, 235 and 160 cases were included in the early- and late term groups, respectively. The median insertion duration was 26 days (range, 2-126 days) and 18 days (range, 2-104 days) in the early- and late term groups, respectively. The internal jugular, subclavian, and femoral veins were the sites of 22.6, 40.2, and 25.7% of the insertions in the early term group and 32.3, 16.9, and 25.4% of the insertions in the late term group, respectively. The frequency of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) was 1.98/1000 catheter days and 2.17/1000 catheter days in the early- and late term groups, respectively. In the subgroup analysis, the detected causative pathogens of CRBSI did not differ between the two term groups; gram-positive cocci, gram-positive bacilli, and gram-negative bacilli were the causative pathogens in 68.9, 11.5, and 14.8% of the cases in the early term group and in 68.2, 11.4, and 18.2% of the cases in the late term group, respectively. In the multivariate analysis to determine the risk of CRBSI, only age was detected as an independent contributing factor; the indwelling catheter duration was detected as a marginal factor. A significant reduction in mechanical complications was associated with the use of ultrasound guidance. CONCLUSIONS Ultrasound-guided CVC insertion did not decrease the incidence of CRBSI. The only identified risk factor for CRBSI was age in our cohort. However, we found that the introduction of ultrasound-guided insertion triggered an overall change in safety management with or without the physicians' intent.","Imataki, Osamu; Shimatani, Mami; Ohue, Yukiko; Uemura, Makiko",BMC infectious diseases,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12879-019-4487-0; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31619174/,446

96870,Recovering from the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Focus on Older Adults.,2020-04-26,"Humans and other mammalian species possess an endogenous circadian clock system that has evolved in adaptation to periodically reoccurring environmental changes and drives rhythmic biological functions, as well as behavioral outputs with an approximately 24-hour period. In mammals body clocks are hierarchically organized, encompassing a so-called pacemaker clock in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), non-SCN brain and peripheral clocks, as well as cell-autonomous oscillators within virtually every cell type. A functional clock machinery on the molecular level, alignment among body clocks, as well as synchronization between endogenous circadian and exogenous environmental cycles has been shown to be crucial for our health and well-being. Yet, modern life constantly poses widespread challenges to our internal clocks, e.g. artificial lighting, shift work, and trans-meridian travel, potentially leading to circadian disruption or misalignment and the emergence of associated diseases. For instance, many of us experience a mismatch between sleep timing on work and free days (social jetlag) in our everyday lives without being aware of health consequences that may arise from such chronic circadian misalignment, Hence, this review provides an overview of the organization and molecular built-up of the mammalian circadian system, its interactions with the outside world, as well as pathologies arising from circadian disruption and misalignment.","Finger, Anna-Marie; Kramer, Achim",Acta physiologica,https://doi.org/10.1111/apha.13548; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32846050/,446

The purpose of this study was to compare the effectiveness of various treatment regimens for acute viral rhinosinusitis in children. We compared the treatment effectiveness of acute viral rhinosinusitis using the herbal medicine Sinupret in the form of oral drops, standard treatment and standard treatment supplemented with topical antibacterial drugs. The objectivity of treatment effectiveness evaluation was based on the complaints' dynamics, the changes' presence in the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity within 10 days: at the initial visit, after 3 days, on the 7th and 10th days after the initial examination. A follow-up visit was also scheduled for the 14th day. The analysis of the obtained data revealed that the Sinupret usage in the complex treatment of children with viral etiology acute rhinosinusitis contributes to a more pronounced positive symptoms' dynamics compared to children who did not receive Sinupret. Sinupret eliminates mucostasis, which contributes to a faster restoration of the drainage and ventilation function of the auditory tube, restores mucociliary clearance, improves the condition and well-being of children, improves the effectiveness of therapy and shortens the treatment time.","Sen'kevich, O A; Sidorenko, S V; Ditrikh, O A",Vestnik otorinolaringologii,https://doi.org/10.17116/otorino20218601146; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33720651/,446

Correspondingly, monumental human and financial resources have been invested in biomedical research, with a mission to decode the mechanisms of ageing and how these contribute to age-related disease. Multiple hallmarks of ageing have been identified that are common across taxa, highlighting their fundamental importance. These include dysregulated mitochondrial metabolism and telomeres biology, epigenetic modifications, cell-matrix interactions, proteostasis, dysregulated nutrient sensing, stem cell exhaustion, inflammageing and immuno-senescence. While our understanding of the molecular basis of ageing is improving, it remains a complex and multifactorial process that remains to be fully understood. A key aspect of the shortfall in our understanding of the ageing process lies in translating data from standard animal models to humans. Consequently, we suggest that a 'biomimetic' and comparative approach, integrating knowledge from species in the wild, as opposed to inbred genetically homogenous laboratory animals, can provide powerful insights into human ageing processes. Here we discuss some particularities and comparative patterns among several species from the animal kingdom, endowed with longevity or short lifespans and unique metabolic profiles that could be potentially exploited to the understanding of ageing and age-related diseases. Based upon lessons from nature, we also highlight several avenues for renewed focus in the pathophysiology of ageing and age-related disease (i.e. diet-microbiome-health axis, oxidative protein damage, adaptive homoeostasis and planetary health).

During the present coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis, telemedicine has been recommended to screen suspected patients to limit risk of exposure and maximise medical staff protection. We constructed the protective physical barrier with telemedicine technology to limit COVID-19 exposure in ED. Our hospital is an urban community hospital with annual ED volume of approximately 50 000 patients. We equipped our patient exam room with intercom and iPad for telecommunication. Based on our telemedicine screening protocol, physician can conduct a visual physical examination on stable patients via intercom or videoconference. Telemedicine was initially used to overcome the physical barrier between patients and physicians. However, our protocol is designed to create a protective physical barrier to protect healthcare workers and enhance efficiency in ED. The implementation can be a promising protocol in making ED care more cost-effective and efficient during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Chou, Eric; Hsieh, Yu-Lin; Wolfshohl, Jon; Green, Fonda; Bhakta, Toral",Emergency medicine journal : EMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2020-209645; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32366616/,446

Given that oxidative stress is a key component of stroke pathology, the potential of L-glutamine in the treatment of ischemic stroke is worth exploring. AIMS In this study, we investigated the effect and mechanisms of action of L-glutamine after cerebral ischemic injury. RESULTS L-glutamine reduced brain infarct volume and promoted neurobehavioral recovery in mice. L-glutamine administration increased the expression of heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) in astrocytes and endothelial cells. Such effects were abolished by the coadministration of Apoptozole, an inhibitor of the ATPase activity of HSP70. L-glutamine also reduced oxidative stress and neuronal apoptosis, and increased the level of superoxide dismutase, glutathione, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor. Cotreatment with Apoptozole abolished these effects. Cell culture study further revealed that the conditioned medium from astrocytes cultured with L-glutamine reduced the apoptosis of neurons after oxygen-glucose deprivation. CONCLUSION L-glutamine attenuated ischemic brain injury and promoted functional recovery via HSP70, suggesting its potential in ischemic stroke therapy.","Luo, Long-Long; Li, Yong-Fang; Shan, Hui-Min; Wang, Li-Ping; Yuan, Fang; Ma, Yuan-Yuan; Li, Wan-Lu; He, Ting-Ting; Wang, Yu-Yang; Qu, Mei-Jie; Liang, Huai-Bin; Zhang, Zhi-Jun; Yang, Guo-Yuan; Tang, Yao-Hui; Wang, Yong-Ting",CNS neuroscience & therapeutics,https://doi.org/10.1111/cns.13184; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31218845/,446
103085,Efficiency of a mechanical device in controlling tracheal cuff pressure in intubated critically ill patients: a randomized controlled study.,2015,"BACKGROUND Continuous glucose monitorings (CGMs) have been used to manage diabetes with reasonable glucose control amongst patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in recent decades. CGMs measure interstitial fluid glucose levels to provide information about glucose levels, which identify fluctuation that would not have been identified with conventional self-monitoring. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a classical tool to measure glycaemic changes. However, the effectiveness of glucose control, hypoglycemia, weight change, quality of life and user satisfaction, are needed to evaluate and compare CGMs and SMBG amongst adults with T2D. METHODS The review will compare the various forms of CGM systems (i.e flash CGM, real-time CGM, retrospective CGM) versus SMBG or usual intervention regarding diabetes management amongst adults with T2D. The following databases will be searched: Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus and grey literature (ClinicalTrials.gov, PsycEXTRA, ProQuest Dissertations, Google Scholar and Theses Global) for the identification of studies. The studies involving adults (aged ≥ 18 years old) will be included. We will only include and summarise randomised clinical trials (RCTs) with respect to authors, publication type, year, status and type of devices. Studies published in English between February 2010 and March 2020, will be included as the field of CGMs amongst T2D patients has emerged over the last decade. Primary outcomes will be HbA1c (glycosylated haemoglobin level) (mmol/L), body weight (kg), time spent with hypoglycaemia (< 70 mg/dl) or hyperglycaemia (≥ 180 mg/dl), blood pressure (< 140/90 mmHg is considered as good management) and quality of life (understanding and feeling of living situation based on culture and value system). Secondary outcome measures will be user satisfaction (patient or treatment/intervention satisfaction or satisfaction scale) and barriers (physical and mental difficulties or issues). Study selection, data extraction and risk of bias assessment will be conducted independently by at least two reviewers. A third reviewer will determine and resolve discrepancies. Moreover, the quality of the evidence of the review will be assessed according to the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool (GRADE). DISCUSSION The review will synthesise evidence on the comparison between using CGMs and SMBG. The results will support researchers and health professionals to determine the most effective methods/technologies in the overall diabetes management.

Recent physiological observations in this field challenge the current understanding of respiratory and circulatory interactions. Thanks to different models available (bench, animal, human), the understanding of physiological phenomena occurring during CPR has progressed. In this review, we describe the clinical observations that have led to the emerging concept of lung volume reduction and associated thoracic airway closure. We summarize the clinical and animal observations supporting these concepts. We then discuss the different contributions of bench, animal, and human models to the understanding of airway closure and their impact on intrathoracic pressure, airway closure, and hemodynamics generated by chest compression. The limitation of airway pressure and ventilation, resulting from airway closure reproducible in models, may play a major role in ventilation and gas exchange impairment observed during prolonged resuscitation.","Charbonney, Emmanuel; Grieco, Domenico L; Cordioli, Ricardo Luiz; Badat, Bilal; Savary, Dominique; Richard, Jean-Christophe M",Respiratory care,https://doi.org/10.4187/respcare.06998; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31138729/,446
104499,Can We Communicate Autonomy Support and a Mandate? How Motivating Messages Relate to Motivation for Staying at Home across Time during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,2021-05-05,"OBJECTIVE To study angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 in a piglet model with acute respiratory distress syndrome and to evaluate the therapeutic potential of this substance in a preclinical setting, as this model allows the assessment of the same parameters required for monitoring the disease in human intensive care medicine. The acute respiratory distress syndrome is the most severe form of acute lung injury with a high mortality rate. As yet, there is no specific therapy for improving the clinical outcome. Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, which inactivates angiotensin II, has been shown to ameliorate acute lung injury in mice. DESIGN Prospective, randomized, double-blinded animal study. SETTING Animal research laboratory. SUBJECTS Fifteen anesthetized and mechanically ventilated piglets. INTERVENTIONS Acute respiratory distress syndrome was induced by lipopolysaccharide infusion. Thereafter, six animals were assigned randomly into angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 group, whereas another six animals served as control. Three animals received angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 without lipopolysaccharide pretreatment. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics, blood gas exchange parameters, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and angiotensin II levels were examined before acute respiratory distress syndrome induction and at various time points after administering angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 or saline. In addition, ventilation-perfusion distribution of the lung tissue was assessed by the multiple inert gas elimination technique. Animals treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 maintained significantly higher PaO2 than the control group, and pulmonary hypertension was less pronounced. Furthermore, angiotensin II and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels, both of which were substantially increased, returned to basal values. Multiple inert gas elimination technique revealed a more homogeneous pulmonary blood flow after treatment with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. In intergroup comparisons, there were no differences in pulmonary blood flow to lung units with subnormal ventilation/perfusion ratios. CONCLUSIONS Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 attenuates arterial hypoxemia, pulmonary hypertension, and redistribution of pulmonary blood flow in a piglet model of acute respiratory distress syndrome, and may be a promising substance for clinical use.","Treml, Benedikt; Neu, Nikolaus; Kleinsasser, Axel; Gritsch, Christian; Finsterwalder, Thomas; Geiger, Ralf; Schuster, Manfred; Janzek, Evelyne; Loibner, Hans; Penninger, Josef; Loeckinger, Alexander",Critical care medicine,https://doi.org/10.1097/ccm.0b013e3181c03009; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19851091/,446

STUDY DESIGN Prospective clinical study. ANIMALS Normal (n=5) and heaves-affected (n=6) horses. METHODS Lung biopsies, 1 from each hemithorax, were collected thoracoscopically using a pre-tied ligating loop. Horses were either normal (C) or heaves-affected with the latter being in remission (Ha) for the initial biopsy and in exacerbation (Hs) for the 2nd biopsy. Clinical variables, PaO(2), and PaCO(2) were used to determine the effect of surgical biopsy. Postoperative pneumothorax was monitored by serial thoracic radiographic examinations. RESULTS Thoracoscopic lung biopsy (n=29, 22 procedures) was well tolerated by all horses. Complication rate was 31%, including 8 ligature slippage and 1 pulmonary hemorrhage. Intranasal oxygen was administered intraoperatively to 6 horses (2 C, 1 Ha, 3 Hs) with severe hypoxemia or labored breathing. There was a significant decrease in PaO(2) during surgery in horses not supplemented with oxygen. Postoperative pneumothorax (21/22 procedures) detected radiographically resolved within 3 weeks. CONCLUSION Thoracoscopic lung biopsy using pre-tied ligating loops was minimally invasive, relatively inexpensive, and fairly efficient. Heaves-affected horses tolerated the surgery well, even when in exacerbation; however, the technique was associated with non life-threatening complications in 31% of the biopsies, most of which required correction with additional ligating loops or more sophisticated instrumentation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Using laparoscopic pre-tied ligating loop for thoracoscopically-assisted lung biopsy can be considered in horses with normal and impaired lung function but alternative instrumentation and access to intranasal oxygen must be available to the surgeon in case of complications.","Relave, Fabien; David, Florent; Leclère, Mathilde; Alexander, Kate; Bussières, Geneviève; Lavoie, Jean Pierre; Marcoux, Marcel",Veterinary surgery : VS,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1532-950x.2008.00371.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18394069/,446

METHODS Between February 2011 and June 2014, 34 RAAs in 28 consecutive patients were treated with noncovered SAE in our center. RESULTS Technical success was 100%. During an average follow-up of 19 months, the systolic and diastolic blood pressures were significantly decreased. Serum creatinine was significantly decreased, and the glomerular filtration rate was significantly increased at the 6 and 12 month follow-up compared with the baseline. The aneurysm sac thrombosis ratio was obviously increased at 1, 6, and 12 months of follow-up. Complications occurred in four patients, including one major, two minor, and one late complication. Computed tomography angiography or digital subtraction angiography demonstrated that the primary patency at 1, 6, and 12 months was 100%, 96%, and 100%, respectively, and primary assisted and secondary patency was 100%, without endoleaks. CONCLUSIONS SAE can be safely and effectively performed in patients with wide-based RAAs or those with critical anatomy.

The present trial was the first to investigate the effect of smartphone-based monitoring on the rate and duration of readmissions in BD. METHODS This was a randomized controlled single-blind parallel-group trial. Patients with BD (ICD-10) discharged from hospitalization in the Mental Health Services, Capital Region of Denmark were randomized 1:1 to daily smartphone-based monitoring including a feedback loop (+ standard treatment) or to standard treatment for 6-months. Primary outcomes: the rate and duration of psychiatric readmissions. RESULTS We included 98 patients with BD. In ITT analyses there was no statistically significant difference in rates (hazard rate: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.54; 1.91, p=0.88) or duration of readmission between the two groups (B: 3.67, 95% CI: -4.77; 12.11, p=0.39). There was no difference in scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (B= -0.11, 95% CI: -2.50; 2.29, p=0.93). The intervention group had higher scores on the Young Mania Rating Scale (B: 1.89, 95% CI: 0.0078; 3.78, p=0.050).

We examined the impact of dose reduction techniques using ECG-triggering, kVp/mAs reduction and high-pitch modes on radiation exposure in a large Australian tertiary CCTA service. METHODS Data on acquisition modes and dose exposure were prospectively collected on all CCTA scans from November 2009 to March 2014 at an Australian tertiary care centre. A dose reduction algorithm was developed using published techniques and implemented with education of medical staff, radiographers and referrers. Associations of CCTA acquisition to radiation over time were analysed with multivariate regression. Specificity in positive CCTA was assessed by correlation with invasive coronary angiography. RESULTS 3333 CCTAs were analysed. Mean radiation dose decreased from 8.4 mSv to 5.3, 4.4, 3.7, 2.9 and 2.8 mSv (P < 0.001) per year. Patient characteristics were unchanged. Dose reduction strategies using ECG-triggering, kVp/mAs reduction accounted for 91% of the decrease. High-pitch scanning reduced dose by an additional 9%. Lower dose was independently related to lower kVp, heart rate, tube current modulation, BMI, prospective triggering and high-pitch mode (P < 0.01). CCTA specificity remained unchanged despite dose reduction. CONCLUSION Implementation of evidence-based CCTA dose reduction algorithm and staff education programme resulted in a 67% reduction in radiation exposure, while maintaining diagnostic specificity.

Hospitalizations present opportunities to educate patients but also challenges to patient comprehension given the complexity and rapid pace of clinical care. We conducted a systematic review of the literature to characterize the current state of inpatients' knowledge of their hospitalization, assess the methods used to determine patient comprehension, and appraise the effects of interventions on improving knowledge. METHODS We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library for articles published from January 1, 1995 through December 11, 2017. Eligible studies included patients under inpatient or observation status on internal medicine, family medicine, or neurology services. We extracted study characteristics (author, year, country, study design, sample size, patient characteristics, methods, intervention, primary endpoints, results) in a standardized fashion. The quality of observational studies was assessed using the NIH Quality Assessment Tool for Observation Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies and the quality of interventional studies was assessed using adapted EPOC criteria from the Cochrane Collaboration. RESULTS Twenty-eight studies met the criteria for inclusion, including 17 observational studies and 11 interventional studies. Patient knowledge of all aspects of their hospitalization was poor and patients often overestimated their knowledge. Older patients and those with lower education levels were more likely to have poorer knowledge. Intervention methods varied, but generally showed improvements in patient knowledge. Few interventional studies assessed the effect on health behaviors or outcomes and those that did were often underpowered. DISCUSSION Clinicians should be aware that comprehension is often poor among hospitalized patients, especially in those with lower education and advanced age. Our results are limited by overall poor quality of interventional studies. Future research should use objective, standardized measures of patient comprehension and interventions should be multifaceted in approach, focusing on knowledge improvement while also addressing other factors influencing outcomes.","Sommer, Arielle E; Golden, Blair P; Peterson, Jonna; Knoten, Claire A; O'Hara, Lyndsey; O'Leary, Kevin J",Journal of general internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11606-018-4658-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30238405/,446

This study investigates the genetic origin and diversity of AvCoV-IBV by analysis of the S1 sequence derived from 49 broiler flocks and 14 layer flocks in different regions of Turkey. AvCoV-IBV RNA was detected in 41 (83.6%) broiler flocks and nine (64.2%) of the layer flocks by TaqMan real-time RT-PCR. In addition, AvCoV-IBV RNA was detected in the tracheas 27/30 (90%), lungs 31/49 (62.2%), caecal tonsils 7/22 (31.8%), and kidneys 4/49 (8.1%) of broiler flocks examined. Pathologic lesions, hemorrhages, and mononuclear infiltrations were predominantly observed in tracheas and to a lesser extent in the lungs and a few in kidneys. A phylogenetic tree based on partial S1 sequences of the detected AvCoV-IBVs (including isolates) revealed that 1) viruses detected in five broiler flocks were similar to the IBV vaccines Ma5, H120, M41; 2) viruses detected in 24 broiler flocks were similar to those previously reported from Turkey and to Israel variant-2 strains; 3) viruses detected in seven layer flocks were different from those found in any of the broiler flocks but similar to viruses previously reported from Iran, India, and China (similar to Israel variant-1 and 4/91 serotypes); and 4) that the AVCoV-IBV, Israeli variant-2 strain, found to be circulating in Turkey appears to be undergoing molecular evolution. In conclusion, genetically different AvCoV-IBV strains, including vaccine-like strains, based on their partial S1 sequence, are circulating in broiler and layer chicken flocks in Turkey and the Israeli variant-2 strain is undergoing evolution.","Yilmaz, Huseyin; Altan, Eda; Cizmecigil, Utku Y; Gurel, Aydin; Ozturk, Gulay Yuzbasioglu; Bamac, Ozge Erdogan; Aydin, Ozge; Britton, Paul; Monne, Isabella; Cetinkaya, Burhan; Morgan, Kenton L; Faburay, Bonto; Richt, Juergen A; Turan, Nuri",Avian diseases,https://doi.org/10.1637/11346-120915-reg.1; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27610718/,446

There are many reports worldwide on the endemicity of this virus. Since it is relatively new, it is not routinely detected in clinical laboratory investigations. CASE REPORT We demonstrated that HBoV infection caused the death of a 5-month-old girl with a history of high fever and wheezing. Human bocavirus (HBoV 1/2/3/4) was found in a nasopharyngeal swab, paraffin-embedded lung tissue and stool samples by multiplex PCR methods using postmortem microbiological analysis. CONCLUSION This case suggests that lower respiratory tract infections due to HBoV may cause severe and life-threatening diseases. Postmortem microbiology is useful in both clinical and forensic autopsies, and allows a suspected infection to be confirmed. To our knowledge, this report is the first document of a HBoV postmortem case in Turkey.","Ziyade, Nihan; Şirin, Gözde; Elgörmüş, Neval; Daş, Taner",Balkan medical journal,https://doi.org/10.5152/balkanmedj.2015.15254; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26167351/,446

The author was involved in the preclinical and subsequently in the clinical development and post-marketing surveillance of lormetazepam. Here, he reviews the published and unpublished data about lormetazepam dependence and proposes explanations for contradictory views from other authors. On this basis and in contrast to class labeling from regulatory bodies and WHO, the author comes to the conclusion that use of lormetazepam definitely carries a lower risk of inducing dependence and causing abuse than most other benzodiazepines. This applies as well to Sedalam®, the new i.v. application form of lormetazepam, which is much better tolerated than propofol. Because of its pharmacokinetic properties and because all its effects can be fully antagonized with the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil, this innovative intravenous application form of lormetazepam provides an excellent method for premedication, symptomatic treatment of excitation and anxiety in the context of surgical or diagnostic procedures including outpatient interventions and for basic sedation during anesthesia.","Horowski, Reinhard",Journal of neural transmission,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00702-020-02209-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32468272/,446

Here we review how cells manipulate and control this curvature in the context of dynamic events such as vesicle-mediated membrane traffic. Lipids and cargo proteins each contribute energy barriers that must be overcome during vesicle formation. In contrast, protein coats and their associated accessory proteins drive membrane bending using a variety of interdependent physical mechanisms. We survey the energy costs and drivers involved in membrane curvature, and draw a contrast between the stochastic contributions of molecular crowding and the deterministic assembly of protein coats. These basic principles also apply to other cellular examples of membrane bending events, including important disease-related problems such as viral egress.","Stachowiak, Jeanne C; Brodsky, Frances M; Miller, Elizabeth A",Nature cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1038/ncb2832; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23999615/,446

National ministries or agencies play central roles in coordinating and supporting the overall response, and local and regional governments or agencies interact with other governments and agencies. Governmental agencies coordinating and/or supporting the outbreak response had difficulties in communicating with other agencies because of the ambiguity of the nature of the infectious disease, slow information disclosure, differences in the organizational priorities, different information standards, and the limitations of the information system.

136793,Different acupuncture therapies for spastic paralysis after stroke: A protocol for systematic review and network meta-analysis.,2020-07-02,"Health care is undergoing major transformation with a shift from fee-for-service care to fee-for-value. The advent of new care delivery and payment models is serving as a driver for value-based care. Hospitals, payors, and patients increasingly expect physicians and healthcare systems to improve outcomes and manage costs. The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on surgical and procedural practices further highlights the urgency and need for anesthesiologists to expand their roles in perioperative care, and to impact system improvement. While there have been substantial advances in anesthesia care, perioperative complications and mortality after surgery remain a key concern. Anesthesiologists are in a unique position to impact perioperative health care through their multitude of interactions and influences on various aspects of the perioperative domain, by using the surgical experience as the first touchpoint to reengage the patient in their own health care. Among the key interventions that are being effectively instituted by anesthesiologists include proactive engagement in preoperative optimization of patients' health; personalization and standardization of care delivery by segmenting patients based upon their complexity and risk; and implementation of best practices that are data-driven and evidence-based and provide structure that allow the patient to return to their optimal state of functional, cognitive, and psychologic health. Through collaborative relationships with other perioperative stakeholders, anesthesiologists can consolidate their role as clinical leaders driving value-based care and healthcare transformation in the best interests of patients.","Mahajan, Aman; Esper, Stephen A; Cole, Daniel J; Fleisher, Lee A",Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/aln.0000000000003717; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33630039/,446

From April 11(th) to 9(th) June 2014, World Health Organization (WHO) reported a total of 402 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS from KSA, out of which 132 cases were reported from Riyadh alone. AIM The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge and apprehension of patients about MERS visiting Al Farabi College of Dentistry, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. MATERIALS AND METHODS A cross-sectional questionnaire based survey was conducted which consisted of 10 self-prepared questions. A total of 404 patients participated in this study. RESULTS Three hundred and forty patients had heard about MERS. Nearly a quarter of the patients (25.74%) were apprehensive about undergoing dental treatment because of MERS. A little more than half of the patients (50.99%) knew that camel was a source of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome-Corona virus. Most of the patients (80.72%) were aware of the infection control measures to be followed by dentist and 138 patients claimed they took some precaution when present inside the dental college. CONCLUSION Majority of the patients had heard about MERS and was aware of the infection control measures. However, some patients were apprehensive about undergoing dental treatment because of MERS. Further steps need to be taken to educate the patient's about transmission of MERS and infection control measures in a dental hospital.","Ashok, Nipun; Rodrigues, Jean Clare; Azouni, Khalid; Darwish, Shorouk; Abuderman, Abdulwahab; Alkaabba, Abdul Aziz Fahad; Tarakji, Bassel",Journal of clinical and diagnostic research : JCDR,https://doi.org/10.7860/jcdr/2016/17519.7790; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27437361/,446

Methods: The method of cross-sectional study was applied. A questionnaire survey of CRC patients in China was carried out. Their basic and treatment information during the COVID-19 were collected and associated effects on treatment, nursing, state of psychology and needs of social support were analyzed. Results: Of the 1147 participants in the study, 635 (55.4%) were male and 512 (44.6%) were female with mean age of (52.8±12.8) years. The treatment or follow up of 896 (78.1%) CRC patients were affected during the COVID-19 outbreak. A total of 253 patients (22.1%) had their treatment regiments changed, of whom 141 (12.3%) had their chemotherapy regiments postponed or changed, and 83 patients (7.2%) had their surgical treatment affected. Among the above 83 patients, 39 patients (3.4%) underwent emergency surgery. A total of 277 patients (24.1%) had their out-of-hospital care needs affected, mainly due to maintenance of PICC (49.5%, 137/277). CRC patients had poorer sleep quality and increased levels of insomnia than before (P<0.001), and were more distressed, anxious, depressed, and angry than they were before. They presented the more requirements of help (P<0.001). In addition, 376 patients (32.8%) had received telemedicine services, but only 36.4% (137/376) of them were satisfied. Conclusions: The COVID-19 epidemic has effect on the integrated treatment of CRC patients include diagnosis, treatment, examination and prognosis. While protecting CRC patients from being infected with SARS-CoV-2, health-care workers should also actively help them to receive timely and correct treatment and pay attention to their nursing, nutritional, psychological and social support needs in the COVID-19 epidemic.","Yang, Y; Gao, Z Y; Chen, Y K; Wang, H Y; Chen, J J; Song, C; Gu, J",Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn.441530-20200416-00219; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32810953/,446
139390,Sidestream microstream end tidal carbon dioxide measurements and blood gas correlations in neonatal intensive care unit.,2013,"Emergence of drug resistance and adverse effects often affect the efficacy of nucleoside analogues in the therapy of Herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) infections. Host-targeting antivirals could therefore be considered as an alternative or complementary strategy in the management of HSV infections. To contribute to this advancement, here we report on the ability of a new generation inhibitor of a key cellular enzyme of de novo pyrimidine biosynthesis, the dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH), to inhibit HSV-1 and HSV-2 in vitro replication, with a potency comparable to that of the reference drug acyclovir. Analysis of the HSV replication cycle in MEDS433-treated cells revealed that it prevented the accumulation of viral genomes and reduced late gene expression, thus suggesting an impairment at a stage prior to viral DNA replication consistent with the ability of MEDS433 to inhibit DHODH activity. In fact, the anti-HSV activity of MEDS433 was abrogated by the addition of exogenous uridine or of the product of DHODH, the orotate, thus confirming DHODH as the MEDS433 specific target in HSV-infected cells. A combination of MEDS433 with dipyridamole (DPY), an inhibitor of the pyrimidine salvage pathway, was then observed to be effective in inhibiting HSV replication even in the presence of exogenous uridine, thus mimicking in vivo conditions. Finally, when combined with acyclovir and DPY in checkerboard experiments, MEDS433 exhibited highly synergistic antiviral activity. Taken together, these findings suggest that MEDS433 is a promising candidate as either single agent or in combination regimens with existing direct-acting anti-HSV drugs to develop new strategies for treatment of HSV infections.","Luganini, Anna; Sibille, Giulia; Mognetti, Barbara; Sainas, Stefano; Pippione, Agnese Chiara; Giorgis, Marta; Boschi, Donatella; Lolli, Marco L; Gribaudo, Giorgio",Antiviral research,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.antiviral.2021.105057; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33716051/,446

Vocal cord paralysis following thyroidectomy can be caused by a vocal cord hematoma with an incidence of 1.4% due to direct injury during orotracheal intubation. In this article, we present a case of VCP caused by vocal cord hematoma. A 32-year-old male patient who has been receiving propylthiouracil treatment for toxic multinodular goiter since 10 years was admitted to our hospital to be operated because of persisting complaints. The patient was hospitalized for sutureless thyroidectomy after he became euthyroid. Preoperative fiberoptic laryngoscopy performed by the ear, nose, and throat department revealed bilaterally motile vocal folds and a completely open airway. Patient underwent sutureless total thyroidectomy with a vessel sealing device (LigasureTM LF1212, Covidien, CO), and a minivac drainage system was placed in the thyroid lodge. On the morning of the first postoperative day, 50 mL of serosanguinous fluid was drained. The patient's voice was normal, and there was no ecchymosis. Postoperative fiberoptic laryngoscopy revealed a hematoma near the right vocal fold and paralysis of the right vocal fold; however, the airway was open. It should be kept in mind that VCP is not solely due to surgery but can also result from intubation, as observed in this case.","Arıkan, Akif Enes; Teksöz, Serkan; Bilgin, İsmail Ahmet; Tarhan, Özge; Özyeğin, Ateş",Turkish journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.5152/ucd.2015.3044; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29260141/,446

However, endoscopic surveillance protocols are hampered by the invasiveness of repeat endoscopy, sampling bias, and a subjective histopathological diagnosis of dysplasia. In this case-control study, we investigated the use of a non-invasive, pan-oesophageal cell-sampling device, the Cytosponge™, coupled with a cancer hot-spot panel to identify patients with dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) Cytosponge™ samples from 31 patients with non-dysplastic and 28 with dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus with good available clinical annotation were selected for inclusion. Samples were microdissected and amplicon sequencing performed using a panel covering >2800 COSMIC hot-spot mutations in 50 oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes. Strict mutation criteria were determined and duplicates were run to confirm any mutations with an allele frequency <12%. When compared with endoscopy and biopsy as the gold standard the panel achieved a 71.4% sensitivity (95% CI 51.3-86.8) and 90.3% (95% CI 74.3-98.0) specificity for diagnosing dysplasia. TP53 had the highest rate of mutation in 14/28 dysplastic samples (50%). CDKN2A was mutated in 6/28 (21.4%), ERBB2 in 3/28 (10.7%), and 5 other genes at lower frequency. The only gene from this panel found to be mutated in the non-dysplastic cases was CDKN2A in 3/31 cases (9.7%) in keeping with its known loss early in the natural history of the disease. Hence, it is possible to apply a multi-gene cancer hot-spot panel and next-generation sequencing to microdissected, FFPE samples collected by the Cytosponge™, in order to distinguish non-dysplastic from dysplastic Barrett's oesophagus. Further work is required to maximize the panel sensitivity.","Katz-Summercorn, Annalise; Anand, Shubha; Ingledew, Sophie; Huang, Yuanxue; Roberts, Thomas; Galeano-Dalmau, Nuria; O'Donovan, Maria; Liu, Hongxiang; Fitzgerald, Rebecca C",The journal of pathology.

Within this framework we consider the cost incurred from the implementation of three types of dynamic control strategies. Taking the context of the 2003 SARS outbreak in Hong Kong as an example, we use a simple cost function to compare the total cost of each mixed (quarantine and isolation) control strategy from a public health resource allocation perspective. The goal is to extend existing epi-economics methodology by developing a theoretical framework of dynamic quarantine strategies aimed at emerging diseases, by drawing upon the large body of literature on the dynamics of infectious diseases. We find that the total cost decreases with increases in the quarantine rates past a critical value, regardless of the resource allocation strategy. In the case of a manageable outbreak resources must be used early to achieve the best results whereas in case of an unmanageable outbreak, a constant-effort strategy seems the best among our limited plausible sets.","Mubayi, Anuj; Zaleta, Christopher Kribs; Martcheva, Maia; Castillo-Chávez, Carlos",Mathematical biosciences and engineering : MBE,https://doi.org/10.3934/mbe.2010.7.687; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20578793/,446
148596,Virtual patients for mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit.,2020-12-22,"BACKGROUND Growing large crop monocultures and heavily using pesticides enhances the evolution of pesticide-insensitive pests and pathogens. To reduce pesticide use in crop cultivation, the application of priming-active compounds (PrimACs) is a welcome alternative. PrimACs strengthen the plant immune system and could thus help to protect plants with lower amounts of pesticides. PrimACs can be identified, for example, by their capacity to enhance the respiratory activity of parsley cells in culture as determined by the oxygen transfer rate (OTR) using the respiration activity monitoring system (RAMOS) or its miniaturized version, µRAMOS. The latter was designed for with suspensions of bacteria and yeast cells in microtiter plates (MTPs). So far, RAMOS or µRAMOS have not been applied to adult plants or seedlings, which would overcome the limitation of (µ)RAMOS to plant suspension cell cultures. RESULTS In this work, we introduce a modified µRAMOS for analysis of plant seedlings. The novel device allows illuminating the seedlings and records the respiratory activity in each well of a 48-well MTP. To validate the suitability of the setup for identifying novel PrimAC in Arabidopsis thaliana, seedlings were grown in MTP for seven days and treated with the known PrimAC salicylic acid (SA; positive control) and the PrimAC candidate methyl 1-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-2-oxocyclopentane-1-carboxylate (Tyr020). Twenty-eight h after treatment, the seedlings were elicited with flg22, a 22-amino acid peptide of bacterial flagellin. Upon elicitation, the respiratory activity was monitored. The evaluation of the OTR course reveals Tyr020 as a likely PrimAC. The priming-inducing activity of Tyr020 was confirmed using molecular biological analyses in A. thaliana seedlings. CONCLUSION We disclose the suitability of µRAMOS for identifying PrimACs in plant seedlings. The difference in OTR during a night period between primed and unprimed plants was distinguishable after elicitation with flg22. Thus, it has been shown that the µRAMOS device can be used for a reliable screening for PrimACs in plant seedlings.","Loogen, Judith; Müller, André; Balzer, Arne; Weber, Sophie; Schmitz, Kathrin; Krug, Roxanne; Schaffrath, Ulrich; Pietruszk, Jörg; Conrath, Uwe; Büchs, Jochen",BMC plant biology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12870-021-03100-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34225655/,446
148662,The value of polyurethane-cuffed endotracheal tubes to reduce microaspiration and intubation-related pneumonia: a systematic review of laboratory and clinical studies.,2016,"BACKGROUND For early gastric cancer located in the upper third of the stomach, we have adopted laparoscopic 1/2-proximal gastrectomy (PG) with two types of reconstruction: double tract reconstruction (L-DT) and jejunal interposition reconstruction with crimping of the jejunum on the anal side of the jejunogastrostomy with a knifeless linear stapler (L-JIP). METHODS Functional outcomes were prospectively compared between these two types of reconstruction following laparoscopic PG. Resection and reconstruction were performed using L-DT (n = 10) and L-JIP (n = 10) alternately. Quality of life was evaluated through a questionnaire and endoscopic examination of the ten patients in each group, and functional evaluations were carried out in five patients of each group. RESULTS The postoperative/preoperative body weight ratio was significantly higher in the L-JIP group than in the L-DT group. While the incidence of reflux esophagitis was 10% in both groups, the endoscope could reach the remnant stomach in all patients. In the L-DT group, the plasma acetaminophen concentration at 15 minutes and the insulin level at 30 minutes were markedly increased after oral administration, while the increases in the blood sugar level at 30 and 60 minutes were more gradual than in the L-JIP group. CONCLUSIONS While L-JIP may be thought of as the ideal method for function-preserving gastrectomy, L-DT may be suitable for gastric cancer patients with impaired glucose tolerance. These results raise the possibility of individualized selection of reconstruction for gastric cancer patients with various kinds of preoperative complications.","Nomura, Eiji; Lee, Sang-Woong; Kawai, Masaru; Yamazaki, Masashi; Nabeshima, Kazuhito; Nakamura, Kenji; Uchiyama, Kazuhisa",World journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1186/1477-7819-12-20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24468278/,446
148796,What is the evidence for the use of parenteral nutrition (PN) in critically ill surgical patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,2018,"Wastewater-based monitoring for SARS-CoV-2 at individual building-level could be an efficient, passive means of early detection of new cases in congregate living settings, but this approach has not been validated. Preliminary samples were collected from a hospital and a local municipal wastewater treatment plant. Molecular diagnostic methods were compared side-by-side to assess feasibility, performance and sensitivity. Refined sample collection and processing protocols were then used to monitor two occupied dormitory complexes (n = 105 and 66) over eight weeks. Wastewater results were validated using known case counts from external clinical testing of building occupants. Results confirm that ultracentrifugation from a 24 hour composite collection had a sensitivity of 96.2% and a specificity of 100%. However, the method could not distinguish new infectious cases from persistent convalescent shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. If the detection of convalescent shedding is considered a false positive, then the sensitivity is 100% and specificity drops to 45%. It was determined that the proposed approach constitutes a highly sensitive wastewater surveillance method for detecting SARS-CoV-2, but it could not distinguish new infectious cases from persistent convalescent shedding. Future work must focus on approaches to distinguish new infections from convalescent shedding to fully realize the potential of building wastewater as a surveillance tool for congregate living.ImportanceSome of the most severe outbreaks of COVID-19 have taken place in places where persons live together, such as a nursing homes. Wastewater testing from individual buildings could be used for frequent pooled surveillance of virus from all occupants, including those who are contagious with or without symptoms. This work provides a sensitive practical method for detecting infected individuals, as validated in two building complexes housing occupants who underwent frequent clinical testing performed by external entities. Although this sensitive method could be deployed now for pooled surveillance as an early warning system to limit outbreaks, the study shows that the approach will require further refinement to differentiate between contagious newly infected individuals from persons who have persistent viral fragments shedding in their stool outside the contagious period.","Colosi, Lisa M; Barry, Katie E; Kotay, Shireen M; Porter, Michael D; Poulter, Melinda D; Ratliff, Cameron; Simmons, William; Steinberg, Limor I; Wilson, D Derek; Morse, Rena; Zmick, Paul; Mathers, Amy J",Applied and environmental microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1128/aem.00433-21; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33858836/,446

Based on the data analysis from the first proficiency panel, harmonization guidelines for a consensus gating protocol were proposed. To validate the recommendations from the first panel and to examine factors that were not included in the first panel, a second ICS gating proficiency panel was organized. All participants analyzed the same set of Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) files using their own gating protocol. An optional learning module was provided to demonstrate how to apply the previously established gating recommendations and harmonization guidelines to actual ICS data files. Eighty-three participants took part in this proficiency panel. The results from this proficiency panel confirmed the harmonization guidelines from the first panel. These recommendations addressed the (1) placement of the cytokine-positive gate, (2) identification of CD4+ CD8+ double-positive T cells, (3) placement of lymphocyte gate, (4) inclusion of dim cells, (5) gate uniformity, and 6) proper adjustment of the biexponential scaling. In addition, based on the results of this proficiency gating panel, two new recommendations were added to expand the harmonization guidelines: 7) inclusion of dump channel marker to gate all live and dump negative cells, and 8) backgating to confirm the correct placement of gates across all populations.","Price, Leah S; Adamow, Matthew; Attig, Sebastian; Fecci, Peter; Norberg, Pamela; Reap, Elizabeth; Janetzki, Sylvia; McNeil, Lisa K",Cytometry.

154969,Psychological Outcomes in Fathers of Critically Ill Children in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit: A Systematic Review.,2021-07-16,"Persisting concussion symptoms (PCS) can last for months, years, or indefinitely and affect a considerable number of concussion patients. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of clinical symptoms of anxiety and depression and the relationship between PCS and quality of life in patients examined at the Canadian Concussion Centre. The Depression and Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS-42) and the WHO Quality of Life Assessment (WHOQOL-Bref) were sent to 526 adult patients diagnosed with PCS. The median with interquartile range (IQR) follow-up time was 5 (4-7) years. Of the 105 respondents, 35.2% displayed mild or greater symptoms of anxiety, depression or both. Importantly, the number of previous concussions was correlated with elevations on the DASS-42 Anxiety (p=0.030) and Depression (p=0.018) sub-scale scores, suggesting an acquired cause of symptoms. Patients with clinical elevations of depression, anxiety, or both exhibited poorer mean WHOQOL-Bref scores in each domain (p<0.001) compared to those who scored in the normal range on the DASS-42. These findings indicate that, depression and anxiety in PCS can endure for years and are associated with diminished quality of life. Consequently, depression and anxiety should be identified and treated early in PCS populations in order to optimize recovery. While the underlying etiology of depression and anxiety cannot be ascertained with certainty in the present study, the association between depression and anxiety and the number of concussions may indicate an organic explanation. In the future, quality of life measures should be incorporated into the treatment and research in PCS to improve intervention strategies and enhance understanding of the trajectory of recovery in this population.","Doroszkiewicz, Corinne; Gold, David; Green, Robin Ea; Tartaglia, Maria Carmela; Ma, Jin; Tator, Charles",Journal of neurotrauma,https://doi.org/10.1089/neu.2020.7313; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32962513/,446

158261,Patient and Provider Risk in Managing ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Decision Analysis.,2020-11-10,"Activation of the renin-angiotensin system (angiotensin-converting enzyme [ACE]/angiotensin II [Ang II] and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [ACE2]/Ang-1-7) has been implicated in the pathophysiology of inflammatory response and acute lung injury (ALI). Previous studies have shown that the ACE inhibitor captopril (Cap) may be a potent therapeutic drug for ALI. However, the mechanisms of its protective effects on ALI are still largely unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effects of Cap on preventing lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury and further investigated the underlying mechanisms of these protective effects. Rats were intraperitoneally pretreated with Cap (50 mg/kg) 30 min prior to an intravenous administration of LPS (7.5 mg/kg). Furthermore, following a 30-min pretreatment with Cap (10 mol/mL) or combined with the ACE2 inhibitor MLN4760 (10 mol/mL), rat pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (PMVECs) were stimulated with LPS (1 mg/mL). Captopril pretreatment significantly attenuated LPS-induced pathophysiological changes in the lung, inhibited secretion of tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 6, reduced the ratio of Ang II to Ang-1-7, and reversed the increased ratio of ACE to ACE2, which was remarkably decreased from 7.07 (LPS only) to 1.71 (LPS + Cap). The protective effects of Cap on ALI were also confirmed by in vitro studies, in which Cap suppressed LPS-induced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and modulated the expression levels of ACE and ACE2. After Cap pretreatment, the ratio of ACE to ACE2 expression was remarkably decreased from 5.18 (LPS alone) to 1.52 (LPS + Cap). Furthermore, Cap given before LPS administration led to inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) 1/2, and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) phosphorylation in PMVECs, whereas MLN4760 abolished the protective effects of Cap on LPS-induced secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and abolished Cap-induced blockade of p38MAPK, ERK1/2, and JNK phosphorylation. Our findings reveal that Cap exerts protective effects on LPS-induced lung injury and the cytotoxicity of PMVECs, and these effects may, at least in part, regulate the balance of ACE and ACE2 expression and inhibit the activation of MAPKs.","Li, Yingchuan; Zeng, Zhen; Li, Yachun; Huang, Weifeng; Zhou, Ming; Zhang, Xiaoli; Jiang, Wei",Shock,https://doi.org/10.1097/shk.0000000000000302; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25768373/,446

An unintended “side-effect” of face masks is their adverse influence on speech perception especially in challenging listening situations. So far, behavioural studies have not pinpointed exactly which feature(s) of speech processing face masks affect in such listening situations. We conducted an audiovisual (AV) multi-speaker experiment using naturalistic speech (i.e. an audiobook). In half of the trials, the target speaker wore a (surgical) face mask, while we measured the brain activity of normal hearing participants via magnetoencephalography (MEG). A decoding model on the clear AV speech (i.e. no additional speaker and target speaker not wearing a face mask) was trained and used to reconstruct crucial speech features in each condition. We found significant main effects of face masks on the reconstruction of acoustic features, such as the speech envelope and spectral speech features (i.e. pitch and formant frequencies), while reconstruction of higher level features of speech segmentation (phoneme and word onsets) were especially impaired through masks in difficult listening situations, i.e. when a distracting speaker was also presented. Our findings demonstrate the detrimental impact face masks have on listening and speech perception, thus extending previous behavioural results. Supporting the idea of visual facilitation of speech is the fact that we used surgical face masks in our study, which only show mild effects on speech acoustics. This idea is in line with recent research, also by our group, showing that visual cortical regions track spectral modulations. Since hearing impairment usually affects higher frequencies, the detrimental effect of face masks might pose a particular challenge for individuals who likely need the visual information about higher frequencies (e.g. formants) to compensate.","Haider, Chandra Leon; Suess, Nina; Hauswald, Anne; Park, Hyojin; Weisz, Nathan",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.461909,446

The study design was a cross sectional online survey administered between 11 August and 11 November 2020. The setting was an Australia-wide online population involving 5483 individuals aged ≥18 residing in Australia. Recruitment occurred in two stages: unrestricted self-selected community sample through mainstream and social media (N= 4089);and purposeful sampling using an online panel company (N=1055). The sample was predominantly female (N= 3,187);mean age of 52.7 years;and approximately representative of adults in Australia for age, location, state and area disadvantage (IRSD quintiles). Climate change was very much a problem for 66.3% of the sample, while COVID-19 was ranked at the same level by only 25.3%. Three times as many participants reported that climate change was very much a problem than COVID-19, despite responding at a time when Australians were experiencing Stage 2 through 4 lockdowns. Demographic differences relating to relative personal concerns are discussed. Even in the midst of the uncertainty of a public health pandemic, Australians report that climate change is their most significant personal problem. Australia needs to apply an evidence-based public health approach to climate change, like it did for the pandemic, which will address the climate change concerns of Australians.","Patrick, Dr Rebecca Garad Dr Rhonda Snell Dr Tristan Enticott Dr Joanne Meadows Professor Graham",The Journal of Climate Change and Health,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.joclim.2021.100032,446

Existing hematology analyzers require labor‐intensive work and a panel of expensive reagents. Herein, an artificial‐intelligence‐enabled reagent‐free imaging hematology analyzer (AIRFIHA) modality is reported that can accurately classify subpopulations of leukocytes with minimal sample preparation. AIRFIHA is realized through training a two‐step residual neural network using label‐free images of isolated leukocytes acquired from a custom‐built quantitative phase microscope. By leveraging the rich information contained in quantitative phase images, not only high accuracy is achieved in differentiating B and T lymphocytes, but also CD4 and CD8 T cells are classified, therefore outperforming the classification accuracy of most current hematology analyzers. The performance of AIRFIHA in a randomly selected test set is validated and is cross‐validated across all blood donors. Due to its easy operation, low cost, and accurate discerning capability of complex leukocyte subpopulations, AIRFIHA is clinically translatable and can also be deployed in resource‐limited settings, e.g., during pandemic situations for the rapid screening of infectious diseases.","Shu, Xin Sansare Sameera Jin Di Zeng Xiangxiang Kai-Yu Tong Pandey Rishikesh Zhou Renjie",Advanced Intelligent Systems,https://doi.org/10.1002/aisy.202000277,446

The UTPI is estimated for the following urban destinations: Bangkok, Paris, London, Dubai, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, New York, Istanbul, Tokyo, Seoul, Osaka, Phuket, Milan, Barcelona, Bali and Hong Kong. Design/methodology/approach Monthly based data measuring the tourism industry's performance for these urban destinations has been collected. This data includes airlines' and hotels' performance, as well as potential tourists' online searches. The obtained data has been combined using a principal component analysis, generating the UTPI. Findings The UTPI shows that all urban areas analyzed in this study experienced a devastating negative impact because of the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak. However, the tourism recovery evolution follows heterogeneous patterns. Research limitations/implications The proposed index can be estimated using additional variables. Moreover, the index is only estimated for 16 tourism cities. Future studies can reproduce the methodology by incorporating further variables and amplifying the geographical coverage. Practical implications The UTPI might be useful for researchers and policymakers interested in using a measure of tourism performance during the COVID-19 pandemic in some of the most important urban destinations. Likewise, the UTPI index may serve as a suitable aggregated measure of tourism performance in a post-COVID-19 era or to monitor tourism during future crises.

The DEAQ drew on current validated, published questionnaires for LEA, linked to the clinical outcomes of relative energy deficiency in sport (RED-S). Questions addressed recognised physiological indicators and consequences of LEA in the context of dance, together with psychological drivers and aetiological factors specific to dance training. LEA was quantified using a scoring system to include these characteristics. Results 247 responses to the DEAQ were analysed (225 female and 22 male), mean age 20.7 years (SD 7.9) with transition to full time training at 15.0 years (SD 7.9) and 85% practising ballet. Psychological, physiological and physical characteristics consistent with LEA were reported by 57% of the female dancers and 29% of male dancers, indicating a risk of RED-S. The unique nature of dance training, in terms of demands and environment, was found to be potentially influential in development of this situation. Less than a third (29%) of dancers were aware of RED-S. Conclusion This study found dancers to be a specific group of high-level exercisers displaying indicators of LEA and consequently at risk of developing the adverse clinical health and performance consequences of RED-S. Awareness of RED-S was low. The DEAQ has the potential to raise awareness and be a practical, objective screening tool to identify dancers in LEA, at risk of developing RED-S.","Keay, N.; Overseas, A.; Francis, G.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.28.20141580v1?rss=1,446

Material and Methods: The clinical activities scale developed by researchers and the Beck Anxiety Scale were used as data collection tools in the study. Descriptive statistical methods, materiality tests, correlation, and regression analysis were used in the analysis of the data. Results: In cardiology clinics, patient admission continued;elective interventional diagnosis and treatment work decreased. Cardiologists declared that there was a serious decline in acute coronary syndrome application (87.2% of cardiologists) and that the most common cause of patients not wanting to come to the hospital was the fear of being infected. The severity of pandemic and the improved treatment protocols for COVID-19 were found to be effective in cardiac interventional treatment decisions. It was found that disruptions in clinical functioning increased anxiety (β=0.128), whereas the fight and prevention against COVID-19 (β=-0.304) decreased anxiety.

Nonetheless, prices dropped significantly, with a decline that started well before the imposition of societal restrictions in Denmark. Periods where wind power covered all of local load saw prices collapse towards zero with little variance under the Covid-19 epidemic. The results have important policy implications.

In the logistic regression model analysis, patients with alopecia had a higher risk of presenting moderate to severe symptoms due to SARS-CoV-2 infection (OR: 80.2; 95% CI 16.2-397.7). In conclusion, the severity of infection was statistically significant in patients over 60 years old and those with alopecia.","Salazar Arenas, Miguel Ángel; Muñoz Del Carpio-Toia, Agueda; Aybar Galdos, Johan; Rodriguez-Morales, Alfonso J",Le infezioni in medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33664171/,446

199736,Telehealth Provider Perspectives during Covid-19: Insights from an Academic Cardiology Practice,2021,"Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA]) is an illegal synthetic amphetamine used as a stimulant and hallucinogen. On January 4, 2010, the Los Angeles County (LAC) Department of Public Health (DPH) learned of six MDMA-related emergency department (ED) visits and one death, all linked to a New Year's Eve event attended by approximately 45,000 persons. LAC DPH conducted an investigation to search for additional MDMA-related ED visits, characterize the cases, and determine whether drug contamination was involved. This report summarizes the results of the investigation, which determined that 18 patients visited EDs in LAC for MDMA-related illness within 12 hours of the rave. All were aged 16-34 years, and nine were female. In addition to using MDMA, 10 of the 18 had used alcohol, and five had used other drugs. Three patients were admitted to the hospital, including one to intensive care. A tablet obtained from one of the patients contained MDMA and caffeine, without known toxic contaminants. The cluster of apparent ecstasy overdoses occurred in the context of likely increasing MDMA use in the county during 2005-2009, as indicated by increased identification of MDMA-containing forensic specimens and a large increase in LAC residents entering drug treatment programs for MDMA.

This paper described the case of a 7-week-old suckling baby from Italy who was SARS-CoV-2-positive only by the cell culture method, with no clinical suspicion of and/or risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The baby was referred to hospital, with signs and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection, before the virus had spread to the province. Nasal and pharyngeal swabs and a nasopharyngeal aspirate were used for conventional and molecular diagnostic assays not including the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Bacteria referred to the resident population were revealed in nasal and pharyngeal swabs. No viruses were detected using both immunofluorescence assay and nucleic acid amplification assays in the nasopharyngeal aspirate. The baby was discharged in good condition after 3 days of hospitalisation. Later, a cytopathic effect on the cell monolayers currently used for respiratory viruses was observed and the viral particles were identified as Coronaviridae by transmission electron microscopy. SARS-CoV-2 was identified by RT-PCR performed both on cell culture and on the stored aliquot of the original sample. The virus isolate was named SARS-Cov-2/human/Parma/1/2020. Cell culture still remains the only reference diagnostic method also for emerging viruses, allowing it to reveal cytopathogenic viruses and demonstrate their infectivity.","Calderaro, Adriana; Arcangeletti, Maria Cristina; De Conto, Flora; Buttrini, Mirko; Montagna, Paolo; Montecchini, Sara; Ferraglia, Francesca; Pinardi, Federica; Chezzi, Carlo",Int J Infect Dis,,446

There is paucity of available data on cancer management in lower-middle income countries during this pandemic, we sought to determine the institutional approach towards management of breast cancer patients and the outcomes during COVID-19 pandemic at our institution. Materials and methods: Clinicopathological and treatment record of cancer patients who presented to the Breast Clinic from 15th March to 31st December 2020 was retrieved from the institutional database for this retrospective clinical observational study. Results: A total of 292 patients were qualified for the analysis in which 206 patients (70.5%) underwent breast cancer surgeries. Only 10 of them (4.9%) were identified to be COVID-19 virus positive on routine pre-operative RT-PCR test before elective surgeries. All were asymptomatic, received home-based care via telecommunication and were operated at a later date when test turned out negative. None of them developed any complications post-operatively. Another group of 86 patients (29.5%) were referred for Neoadjuvant/Systemic chemotherapy in which COVID-19 infection was detected in only 4 patients (4.6%) while receiving cycles. Two patients shown symptoms of cough and fever hence hospitalised but were not candidates for Intensive Care Unit admission while other two patient were asymptomatic and isolated at home. All patients recovered well and chemotherapy was commenced again after negative RT-PCR test. No mortality was observed. Conclusion: Despite of being a global crisis particularly for cancer patients we observed infectivity, complications and fatality much lower among breast cancer cases. Further research is needed in this regard including public and private sector hospitals for better understanding behavior of COVID-19 disease and achieve common goal to combat COVID-19 and cancer together.","Vohra, Lubna M; Jabeen, Dua; Asif, Narmeen; Ahad, Abdul",,,446

212511,Covid-19 pneumonia in pediatric patients with tracheostomy,2021,"BACKGROUND: Serum neurofilament light chain (sNfL) is an established biomarker of neuro-axonal damage in multiple neurological disorders. Raised sNfL levels have been reported in adults infected with pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Levels in children infected with COVID-19 have not as yet been reported. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether sNfL is elevated in children contracting COVID-19. METHODS: Between May 22 and July 22, 2020, a network of outpatient pediatricians in Bavaria, Germany, the Coronavirus antibody screening in children from Bavaria study network (CoKiBa), recruited healthy children into a cross-sectional study from two sources: an ongoing prevention program for 1-14 years, and referrals of 1-17 years consulting a pediatrician for possible infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). We determined sNfL levels by single molecule array immunoassay and SARS-CoV-2 antibody status by two independent quantitative methods. RESULTS: Of the 2652 included children, 148 (5.6%) were SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive with asymptomatic to moderate COVID-19 infection. Neurological symptoms-headache, dizziness, muscle aches, or loss of smell and taste-were present in 47/148 cases (31.8%). Mean sNfL levels were 5.5 pg/ml (SD 2.9) in the total cohort, 5.1 (SD 2.1) pg/ml in the children with SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, and 5.5 (SD 3.0) pg/ml in those without. Multivariate regression analysis revealed age-but neither antibody status, antibody levels, nor clinical severity-as an independent predictor of sNfL. Follow-up of children with pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome (n = 14) showed no association with sNfL. CONCLUSIONS: In this population study, children with asymptomatic to moderate COVID-19 showed no neurochemical evidence of neuronal damage.","Geis, Tobias; Brandstetter, Susanne; Toncheva, Antoaneta A; Laub, Otto; Leipold, Georg; Wagner, Ralf; Kabesch, Michael; Kasser, Severin; Kuhle, Jens; Wellmann, Sven",J. neurol,,446

Parenteral Fish-Oil Emulsions in Critically Ill COVID-19 Emulsions,2020,"Electrochemical analyses aided by density functional theory calculations were used to investigate the oxidative degradation of pyrazine antiviral drugs, 3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide (T-1105) and 6-fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide (favipiravir, T-705), by electro-generated superoxide radical anion. T-1105 and T-705 are antiviral RNA nucleobase analogs that selectively inhibit the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. They are expected as a drug candidate against various viral infections, including COVID-19. The pyrazine moiety was decomposed by superoxide through proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET). Our results show that its active form, pyrazine-ribofuranosyl-5'-triphosphate, is easily oxidized under inflamed organs by overproduced superoxide through the PCET mechanism in the immune system. This mechanistic study implies that the oxidative degradation of pyrazine derivatives will be prevented by controlling the PCET through simple modification of the pyrazine structure.","Tatsushi, Nakayama Ryo Honda",,,446

In this study viruses in untreated and treatedwastewater has been reviewed to evaluate the health threats to the people. It has been cited that viruses such as Rotavirus, Norwalk virus, adenovirus, and Hepatitis A virus, are common mediators of the diseases in human beings. Including respiratory disorders, bronchiolitis, digestive tract disorders, pneumonia and conjunctivitis. Additionally, traces of COVID-19 were also found in sewage water sources in some countries like Italy bringing attention towards analysis of sewage water. Based on information from cited literature it is estimated that an individual handling sewage water have approximately 1% chance of becoming infected with virus. Treated sewage effluent and reuse of sewage water for recycle purposes must be considered as it may lead to widespread of COVID 19 in coming decade. Thus, a qualitative risk assessment and disinfection of water supplies based on reported infection rates suggested that viruses in treated and untreated sewage effluents may pose the most risk. This risk assessment and a limited epidemiological evidence suggest that TSE is not harmful for the public places but it cannot be neglected, therefore proper guidelines and policies are required.","Alam, A.; Ali, L.",Pakistan Journal of Zoology,,446

Variant films were prepared employing the casting method and using hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose and polyvinyl alcohol. The formulated films were investigated for insulin content, weight variation, surface pH, thickness, folding endurance and disintegration time. In vitro release study was conducted for the selected formulations (F6, F7, F8). A drug/polymer interaction was investigated in the optimized formulation (F7) employing Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Clinical study was accomplished for F7 on 20 patients. Sniffin's and olfactory discrimination tests were used for assessing patients. The formulated films displayed appropriate physical characteristics. F7 showed the shortest disintegration time (50 ± 7 s) and fastest release. It displayed compatibility between the drug and the used polymers. The results of the clinical study revealed a significant increase in the olfactory detection scores and olfactory discrimination values in the intervention group (7.9 ± 1.2, 6.7 ± 0.5 respectively) compared to placebo group (3 ± 0.8, 2.8 ± 1).. Intervention group showed significant differences between these scores before and after treatment while the placebo group did not display any significant differences.

Methods This prospective review of consecutive elective surgical consent forms was conducted from 20 July 2020 to 16 August 2020 at the Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust, England. The primary outcome was evidence of COVID-19 risk documentation on the consent forms. Results A total of 116 patients' consent forms were reviewed. Most patients were American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) grade 2 (n=70; 60.34%). Only 25 consent forms (21.55%) had COVID -19 and its associated risks documented, with registrars being the most compliant (19/46; 41.3%) followed by consultants (6/51; 11.7%). With regards to the surgical sub-specialities, general surgery, orthopaedics and ENT had the highest compliance with the guidance. Conclusions As the elective activity resumes, peri-operative risks of COVID-19 should be weighted in during the informed consent process, as mentioned in the latest international guidelines on consent to avoid litigation and negligence claims.","Darwish, Nourelhuda M; Iqbal, Muhammad Rafaih; Dhahri, Adeel Abbas; Jacob, Neville; Jebamani, Jennifer; Easthope, Amy; Vijay, Vardhini",Cureus,,446

METHODS: This study is a prospective, nationwide study in patients with solid cancer and SARS-CoV-2 infection included between 10 March to 15 June 2020. Patient's baseline characteristics were collected. The study's primary outcome was overall survival within 30 days of verified SARS-CoV-2 infection. Secondary outcomes were hospital admission, admission to an ICU, and need for supplemental oxygen. RESULTS: A total of 112 patients with a cancer diagnosis and verified SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified. After one month of follow up, hospitalization was required for 54% (n = 61) and 21% of the patients had died and 14 of the 23 deceased cancer patients were &#8805;70 years. Most patients were classified with mild COVID-19 symptoms (66%, n = 74); however, 48% (n = 23) of the &#8805;70-year-olds patients were classified with severe or critical COVID-19 symptoms.

This process is widely employed by human viruses such as HIV and SARS coronavirus and is critical for their replication. Here, we developed a high-throughput approach to assess the frameshifting potential of a sequence. We designed and tested >12,000 sequences based on 15 viral and human PRF events, allowing us to systematically dissect the rules governing ribosomal frameshifting and discover novel regulatory inputs based on amino acid properties and tRNA availability. We assessed the natural variation in HIV gag-pol frameshifting rates by testing >500 clinical isolates and identified subtype-specific differences and associations between viral load in patients and the optimality of PRF rates. We devised computational models that accurately predict frameshifting potential and frameshifting rates, including subtle differences between HIV isolates. This approach can contribute to the development of antiviral agents targeting PRF.","Mikl, Martin; Pilpel, Yitzhak; Segal, Eran",Nat Commun,,446

Surface glycoprotein and nucleocapsid phosphoprotein are two important proteins of this virus facilitating its entry into host cell and genome replication. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a prospective tool of the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway for the control of human viral infections by suppressing viral gene expression through hybridization and neutralization of target complementary mRNA. So, in this study, the power of RNA interference technology was harnessed to develop siRNA molecules against specific target genes namely, nucleocapsid phosphoprotein gene and surface glycoprotein gene. Conserved sequence from 139 SARS-CoV-2 strains from around the globe was collected to construct 78 siRNA that can inactivate nucleocapsid phosphoprotein and surface glycoprotein genes. Finally, based on GC content, free energy of folding, free energy of binding, melting temperature, efficacy prediction and molecular docking analysis, 8 siRNA molecules were selected which are proposed to exert the best action. These predicted siRNAs should effectively silence the genes of SARS-CoV-2 during siRNA mediated treatment assisting in the response against SARS-CoV-2.","Chowdhury, Umar Faruq; Sharif Shohan, Mohammad Umer; Hoque, Kazi Injamamul; Beg, Mirza Ashikul; Sharif Siam, Mohammad Kawsar; Moni, Mohammad Ali",Genomics,,446

Methods: Using publicly accessible data collected by the United States Census Bureau, Environmental Protection Agency, and other agencies, county-level mortality rates were regressed on concentration values of ground-level ozone, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and sulfur dioxide. Four confounder variables were included in the regression analysis: median household income, rate of hospital beds, population density, and days since first confirmed case. Results: Regression analysis showed that ground-level ozone is positively correlated with county-level mortality rates regardless of whether confounders are controlled for. Nitrogen dioxide is also shown to have a direct relationship with county-level mortality rates, except when all confounders are included in the analysis. Conclusions: High ground-level ozone and nitrogen dioxide concentrations contribute to a greater COVID-19 mortality rate. To limit further losses, it is important to reflect research findings in public policies. In the case of air pollution, environmental restrictions should be reinforced, and extra precautions should be taken as facilities start reopening.","Liu, Samuel; Li, Meng",Rev Panam Salud Publica,,446

Predictions of mortality and hospitalization help governments meet planning and resource allocation challenges. In this paper, we consider the weekly forecasting of the cumulative mortality due to COVID-19 at the national and state level in the U.S. Optimal decision-making requires a forecast of a probability distribution, rather than just a single point forecast. Interval forecasts are also important, as they can support decision making and provide situational awareness. We consider the case where probabilistic forecasts have been provided by multiple forecasting teams, and we aggregate the forecasts to extract the wisdom of the crowd. With only limited information available regarding the historical accuracy of the forecasting teams, we consider aggregation (i.e. combining) methods that do not rely on a record of past accuracy. In this empirical paper, we evaluate the accuracy of aggregation methods that have been previously proposed for interval forecasts and predictions of probability distributions. These include the use of the simple average, the median, and trimming methods, which enable robust estimation and allow the aggregate forecast to reduce the impact of a tendency for the forecasting teams to be under- or overconfident. We use data that has been made publicly available from the COVID-19 Forecast Hub. While the simple average performed well for the high mortality series, we obtained greater accuracy using the median and certain trimming methods for the low and medium mortality series. It will be interesting to see if this remains the case as the pandemic evolves.","Taylor, Kathryn S.; Taylor, James W.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.11103v2.pdf,446

It has drastically changed the way we perceive this world. A paradigm shift was observed globally as the world's emphasis shifted to testing, diagnosis, treatment, and developing a coronavirus cure. Clinical trials were also not untouched by this. The coronavirus pandemic has abhorrently affected the day to day clinical trial activities at sites. METHODS: The status of various ongoing clinical trials was assessed through literature search which also includes clinical trial portals. Our evaluations were based on these observations. RESULTS: Multiple challenges were present in clinical trials as recruitment, retention, safety of trial subjects, protocol compliance, and this made the world to re-think to incorporate newer strategies and to cope with this untoward situation. CONCLUSION: Digitalization of the clinical trials as virtual management of adverse events, remote monitoring visits, and web-based consulting with trial subjects are potential directions that can be applied to better manage clinical trials worldwide.","Singh, Vinay; Garg, Sandeep; Klimek, Monika; Sinha, Rajeev Ranjan; Dhanwal, Dinesh",Reviews on recent clinical trials (Online),,446

Primary BIEC-c4 cells showed staining greater than 90 % for 16 lectins but less than 50 % staining for four lectins. Immortalized BIECs showed significantly different lectin binding profile for few lectins compared to BIEC-c4 cells. BIEC-c4 cells were studied for infectivity to E. coli, Salmonella enterica, bovine rotavirus, bovine coronavirus, and bovine viral diarrhea virus. Bovine strain E. coli B41 adhered to BIEC-c4 cells and Salmonella strains S. Dublin and S. Mbandaka showed strong cell invasion. BIEC-c4 cells were susceptible to bovine rotavirus. LPS stimulation upregulated IL-10, IL-8, and IL-6 expression and Poly I:C upregulated TLR 8 and TLR 9 expression.

This literature review aims to explore and describe the updated information about COVID-19 associated with pulmonary aspergillosis. We found that Aspergillus spp. can cause co-infections in patients with COVID-19, especially in severe/critical illness. The incidence of IPA in COVID-19 ranged from 19.6% to 33.3%. Acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring mechanical ventilation was the common complications, and the overall mortality was high, which could be up to 64.7% (n = 22) in the pooled analysis of 34 reported cases. The conventional risk factors of invasive aspergillosis were not common among these specific populations. Fungus culture and galactomannan test, especially from respiratory specimens could help early diagnosis. Aspergillus fumigatus was the most common species causing co-infection in COVID-19 patients, followed by Aspergillus flavus. Although voriconazole is the recommended anti-Aspergillus agent and also the most commonly used antifungal agent, aspergillosis caused by azole-resistant Aspergillus is also possible. Additionally, voriconazole should be used carefully in the concern of complicated drug-drug interaction and enhancing cardiovascular toxicity on anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents. Finally, this review suggests that clinicians should keep alerting the possible occurrence of pulmonary aspergillosis in severe/critical COVID-19 patients, and aggressively microbiologic study in addition to SARS-CoV-2 via respiratory specimens should be indicated.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Yu, Weng-Liang",J. microbiol. immunol. infect,,446

233590,Pathological brain CT scans in severe COVID-19 ICU patients,2020,"Introduction After more than a year of pharmacology delivery through a virtual curriculum to help prepare medical students to successfully complete the USMLE Step-1 and/or COMLEX Level-1 (for osteopathic medical students), these high stakes board exams will transition to a Pass/Fail system in 2022. To reflect on the effectiveness of the pharmacology educational approaches used before and after the rapid implementation of emergency remote teaching, board results outcomes, faculty student evaluations and student feedback were reviewed and compared to results from national satisfaction instruments during the past decade. Our hypothesis is that satisfaction with the pre-clerkship pharmacology instruction will increase during the clerkship years as measured by the satisfaction instruments after graduation. Methods The aggregate data published between 2010-2020 by national satisfaction instruments including: 1) Academic Year Graduating Seniors Survey Report published by the AACOM and 2) All-Schools Summary Report Medical School Graduation Questionnaire published by the AAMC, was used to develop a construct of satisfaction scores in pharmacology. Pharmacology faculty student evaluations from the Alabama College of Osteopathic Medicine were analyzed using a thematic analysis method for student satisfaction. Class performance outcomes on boards were also analyzed. Results The population of medical students graduating has increased over the past decade, and national satisfaction instruments show that satisfaction of pharmacology instruction amongst the medical graduates also increased with the highest satisfaction score achieved in 2019 (2.13) and 2020 (2.14) compared to the lowest achieved in 2012 (1.97). Similarly, more osteopathic medical graduates agreed that instruction of clinical pharmacology was appropriate in 2019 (85%) compared to the lowest in 2011 (75%) (data from 2020 not yet available). Conclusions Pre-clerkship student satisfaction can be difficult to assess during a very stressful period, especially before the boards. Pharmacology teaching is more intense, and in our institution, it has yielded positive outcomes in board passing rates. In March of 2020, pharmacology faculty were faced with the challenge of rapidly transitioning into emergency remote teaching due to the Covid-19 pandemic. This pandemic will likely continue to disrupt medical education well into the end of 2021, just before the USMLE Step-1/COMLEX Level-1 boards implement the pass/fail grading system. With all these changes and disruptions, pharmacology education is at a crossroads and it hinges on the future direction.","Hernandez, Mark Parker Robert MacGregor Gordon",The FASEB Journal,,446

However, the findings from these studies are limited by methodology and data analysis. This study is a cohort study. We nonselectively and consecutively collected a total of 663 participants in a Chinese hospital from January 7 to February 28. Standardized and two-piecewise Cox regression model were employed to evaluate the association between baseline neutrophil count (bNC), neutrophil count change rate (NCR), and death. bNC had a U-shaped association with death. In the range of 0.1 to &#8804;1.49 × 109 /L (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.19, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.05-0.66) and >3.55 × 109 /L of bNC (HR = 2.82, 95% CI = 1.19-6.67), the trends on bNC with mortality were opposite. By recursive algorithm, the bNC at which the risk of the death was lower in the range of >1.49 to &#8804;3.55 × 109 /L (HR = 13.64, 95% CI = 0.25-74.71). In addition, we find that NCRs (NCR1 and NCR2) are not associated with COVID-19-related deaths. Compared with NCR, bNC has the potential to be used for early risk stratification in patients with COVID-19 infection. The relationship between bNC and mortality was U-shaped. The safe range of bNC was 1.64-4.0 × 109 /L. Identifying the correlation may be helpful for early risk stratification and medical decision-making.","Fu, Wei; Chen, Chi; Chen, Xin-Lin; Wang, Kun; Zuo, Peiyuan; Liu, Yuwei; Zhang, Meng; Zhao, Xiaofang; Xie, Songpu; Zhang, Hao; Geng, Yan; Liu, Chengyun",J Med Virol,,446

243157,Correction to: Lung ultrasound predicts clinical course and outcomes in COVID-19 patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: There is increasing evidence that the individual physician is the main factor influencing variability in end-of-life decision-making in intensive care units. End-of-life decisions are complex and should be adapted to each patient. Physician-related variability is problematic as it may result in unequal assessments that affect patient outcomes. The primary aim of this study was to investigate factors contributing to physician-related variability in end-of-life decision-making. METHOD: This is a qualitative substudy of a previously conducted study. In-depth thematic analysis of semistructured interviews with 19 critical care specialists from five different Swedish intensive care units was performed. Interviews took place between 1 February 2017 and 31 May 2017. RESULTS: Factors influencing physician-related variability consisted of different assessment of patient preferences, as well as intensivists' personality and values. Personality was expressed mainly through pace and determination in the decision-making process. Personal prejudices appeared in decisions, but few respondents had personally witnessed this. Avoidance of criticism and conflicts as well as individual strategies for emotional coping were other factors that influenced physician-related variability. Many respondents feared criticism for making their assessments, and the challenging nature of end-of-life decision-making lead to avoidance as well as emotional stress. CONCLUSION: Variability in end-of-life decision-making is an important topic that needs further investigation. It is imperative that such variability be acknowledged and addressed in a more formal and transparent manner. The ethical issues faced by intensivists have recently been compounded by the devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating in profound terms the importance of the topic.","Nordenskjöld Syrous, Alma; Malmgren, Johan; Odenstedt Hergès, Helena; Olausson, Sepideh; Kock-Redfors, Maria; Ågård, Anders; Block, Linda",Acta anaesthesiol. scand,,446

DESIGN: Contact investigations with active case finding were used to assess the pattern of spread from 2 COVID-19 index patients. SETTING: A community hospital and university medical center in the United States, in February and March, 2020, early in the COVID-19 pandemic. PATIENTS: Two index patients and 421 exposed health care workers. METHODS: Exposed staff were identified by analyzing the EMR and conducting active case finding in combination with structured interviews. Staff were tested for COVID-19 by obtaining oropharyngeal/nasopharyngeal specimens, with RT-PCR testing to detect SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Two separate index patients were admitted in February and March 2020, without initial suspicion for COVID-19 and without contact or droplet precautions in place; both patients underwent several aerosol generating procedures in this context. A total of 421 health care workers were exposed in total, and the results of the case contact investigations identified 8 secondary infections in health care workers. In all 8 cases, the staff had close contact with the index patients without sufficient personal protective equipment. Importantly, despite multiple aerosol generating procedures, there was no evidence of airborne transmission. CONCLUSION: These observations suggest that, at least in a healthcare setting, a majority of SARS-CoV-2 transmission is likely to take place during close contact with infected patients through respiratory droplets, rather than by long-distance airborne transmission.","Bays, Derek J; Nguyen, Minh-Vu H; Cohen, Stuart H; Waldman, Sarah; Martin, Carla S; Thompson, George R; Sandrock, Christian; Tourtellotte, Joel; Pugashetti, Janelle Vu; Phan, Chinh; Nguyen, Hien H; Warner, Gregory Y; Penn, Bennett H",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,,446

Visualizing it with visible and scientific mapping techniques is the secondary goal. Material and Methods: Raw data for 2020 have been downloaded from the Web of Science Core Collection database. A total of 787 articles were reviewed. Raw data were analyzed with Bibliometrix and VOSviewer. The articles about COVID-19, related with the respiratory system and infectious diseases were included. The perspectives of other disciplines were excluded with the analysis. Results: A total of 787 articles were published in 108 different journals. The average number of citations per article is 10.17. There are four studies with over 300 citations. The top three authors with the highest H index are Raoult D, Colson P and Rolasin JM. The h, g and m indices of the authors were calculated and the core authors were determined according to Lotka's law. The top three countries that publish the most articles are China, America and Italy. Finally, according to the word mining analysis, it was determined that the studies can be classified under three clusters. Conclusion: One of the tools that will accelerate the basic reading process in the face of the numerical increase rate of publications on COVID-19 is the bibliometric analysis results. The most up-to-date and basic information on treatment options can be found collectively in bibliometric studies.","Yildiz Gülhan, P.; Kurutkan, M. N.",Duzce Medical Journal,,446

The aims of this work are to find a relationship between self-assessed health and internet use by older people in European countries and to ascertain whether this relationship differs in countries with a more developed eHealth policy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An ordered logistic regression is estimated for all countries in the sample and for two countries subsets which differ in their eHealth performance. Individual data is collected by SHARE. The classifying criterion of eHealth performance is based on the 'eHealth' policy dimension of the indicator used to construct the Digital Economy and Society Index. The average marginal effects are computed for the variable of internet use. RESULTS: Results show that older people who use the internet tend to report better health status. This relationship however may not hold for low levels of health and it is stronger in countries with low eHealth performance. CONCLUSION: Policy measures on eHealth not only contribute to people's health but also help to alleviate critical situations such as the one created by the Covid-19 pandemic.","Tavares, Aida Isabel",Int J Med Inform,,446

This study describes a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak and corresponding reported symptomatology at a shelter in Toronto. METHODS: This clinical and epidemiologic analysis focuses on a COVID-19 outbreak at a dedicated refugee shelter in downtown Toronto. All adult residents on site at the shelter were offered SARS-CoV-2 testing on Apr. 20, 2020. At the time of testing, residents were screened for 3 typical COVID-19 symptoms (fever, cough and shortness of breath). Among those who tested positive, a more comprehensive clinical assessment was conducted 1 day after testing and a standardized 15-item symptom screen was administered by telephone 14 days after testing. We report rates of positive test results and clinical symptoms with each assessment interval. RESULTS: Of the 63 adult residents on site at the shelter, 60 agreed to be tested. Among those tested, 41.7% (n = 25) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Of those who tested positive (n = 25), 20.0% (n = 5) reported fever, cough or shortness of breath at the time of testing. On more detailed assessment 1 day later, 70.8% (17/24) reported a broader range of symptoms. During the 14 days after testing, 87.5% (21/24) reported symptoms of infection. INTERPRETATION: We found a high rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection in this shelter population. Our study underscores the high risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in congregate living settings and the importance of mobilizing timely testing and management of symptomatic, paucisymptomatic and asymptomatic residents in shelters.","Redditt, Vanessa; Wright, Vanessa; Rashid, Meb; Male, Roy; Bogoch, Isaac",CMAJ Open,,446

The COVID-19 outbreak was believed to have emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan, a metropolis city of more than 11 million population in Hubei province, China. We introduced a statistical disease transmission model using case symptom onset data to estimate the transmissibility of the early-phase outbreak in China, and provided sensitivity analyses with various assumptions of disease natural history of the COVID-19. We fitted the transmission model to several publicly available sources of the outbreak data until 11, February 2020, and estimated lock down intervention efficacy of Wuhan city. The estimated R 0 was between 2.7 and 4.2 from plausible distribution assumptions of the incubation period and relative infectivity over the infectious period. 95% confidence interval of R 0 were also reported.

One of the heavily utilized measures during this pandemic is vitamin C (aka ascorbic acid). Unfortunately, vitamin C has been associated with glucose measurement interference and thus this study highlights the elevated levels of blood glucose correlated with the presence of vitamin C interference. METHODOLOGY: Thirty samples were selected randomly and the blood glucose were measured prior and post the addition of spiked standard concentrations of vitamin C. The interference of vitamin C with glucose readings in COVID-19 pandemic were evaluated and observed employing the Auto Chemistry Analyzer machine. RESULTS: The addition of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) standards (spikes) into the isolated samples shows a correlated increment in the reading measures. Thereafter, the increments of Random Blood Sugar (RBS) readings after being spiked with the vitamin C standards shows a logarithmic correlation with good interesting R-squared (R2 = 0.9921). CONCLUSIONS: The authors find that the presence of vitamin C in blood actively and significantly alters the glucose level readings especially with the highly consumption of vitamin C during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Al-Obaidi, Zaid Mahdi Jaber; Hussain, Yasmeen Ali; Ali, Alaa A; Al-Rekabi, Mohammed Dakhil",J Infect Dev Ctries,,446

This had a significant impact on the movement of people within the country. Our study aims to quantify the impact that these measures had on outdoor air pollution levels. We obtained air quality data from April 2016 to May 2020 from five weather and air quality stations in Singapore as well as mobility data for 2020 from Apple, Google, and the Singaporean Housing & Development Board. We determined that outdoor air pollution during the lockdown significantly decreased when compared with the same period in the previous four years even if we included corrections for long time trends in the analysis. The concentrations of the following pollutants PM10, PM2.5, NO2, CO, and SO2decreased by 23, 29, 54, 6, and 52%, respectively, whilst that of O3increased by 18%. The Pollutant Standard Index decreased by 19%. The trends of PM2.5and NO2were significantly correlated with mobility data. The NO2and SO2tropospheric concentrations and the total aerosol optical depth at 550nm obtained from satellite data during the lockdown in 2020 were also lower than during the same period in 2019.

However, the awareness of population aging and gerontechnology is far from sufficiently addressed in the architectural design education in universities. Therefore, an interdisciplinary approach in design education is urgently needed to raise the awareness of the aging crisis among the future architects, interior designers, and beyond. This article introduces a novel model of a design seminar offered by a German University, addressing population aging issues in the architecture department. The syllabus, formality, and the expected results of the seminar are revealed in detail. The participants are encouraged to apply interdisciplinary knowledge such as barrier-free architecture, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, robotics, medicine, psychology, and business to achieve the goals of the seminar. Based on the originality and degree of completion, several students' works are selected and reported, targeting a variety of diseases or syndromes related to aging, such as dementia, immobility, and tremors. Overall, participants of this seminar are motivated and have positive feedback on this seminar, oftentimes claiming that they have seldom studied similar topics in previous architecture education. This enables students from architecture as well as other fields to be better prepared to tackle the upcoming challenges such as labor shortages and infectious diseases in a rapidly aging world. Furthermore, the seminar creates novel concepts that serve as a win-win ""honeypot"" for both students and their instructors, potentially sparking research topics and start-ups with concepts fostered in this seminar. © 2020 Proceedings of the 37th International Symposium on Automation and Robotics in Construction, ISARC 2020: From Demonstration to Practical Use - To New Stage of Construction Robot.

We identified 11 RNA viruses, 4 DNA viruses, 4 species of bacteria, and 1 fungus. While most are known to cause ARIs, others, such as echovirus 6, are rarely associated with respiratory disease. Co-infection of viruses and bacteria and of multiple viruses were commonplace (9/48), with one patient harboring 5 different pathogens, and genome sequence data revealed large intra-species diversity. Expressed resistance against eight classes of antibiotic was detected, with those for MLS, Bla, Tet, Phe at relatively high abundance.

METHODS: COVID-19 patients were randomly divided into training and test groups. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed to identify the disease prognosis signature, which was selected to establish a risk model in the training group. Furthermore, the disease prognosis signature of COVID-19 was validated in the test group. RESULTS: The signature of COVID-19 was combined with five indicators, namely neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, procalcitonin, older age, and C-reactive protein. The signature stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups with significantly relevant disease prognosis (log-rank test, P<0.001) in the training group. The survival analysis indicated that the high-risk group displayed substantially lower survival probability than the low-risk group (log-rank test P<0.001). The area under ROC curve (AUC) showed that the signature of COVID-19 displayed the highest predictive accuracy regarding disease prognosis, which was 0.955 in the training group and 0.945 in the test group. The ROC analysis of both groups demonstrated that the predictive ability of the signature surpassed the use of each of the five indicators alone. CONCLUSION: The signature of COVID-19 presents a novel predictor and prognostic biomarker for closely monitoring patients and providing timely treatment for those who are severely or critically ill.","Wu, Shangrong; Du, Zhiguo; Shen, Sanying; Zhang, Bo; Yang, Hong; Li, Xia; Cui, Wei; Chen, Fangxiong; Huang, Jin",Clin. infect. dis,,446

278943,Predictors of Covid-19 Related Intra-cardiac Thrombus from Admission Laboratory Values,2021,"OBJECTIVES: to identify the Italian provinces with excess mortality during the COVID-19 epidemics using the mortality data provided in April 2020 by the Italian National Institute of Statistics (Istat) that, by design, included only the municipalities with at least 20% mortality increase compared to the same period in 2015-19. Inference with the aim to identify increased mortality at provincial level was a very important task when the Istat data were released in April, but the naïve aggregation of the selected municipalities was not sensible to due to the selection criteria of the municipalities used by Istat. DESIGN: use of a permutation-based approach to identify the Italian provinces with excess mortality during the first month of the COVID-19 epidemics using the data made available from Istat and taking into account the biased inclusion criteria. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: the number of deaths from any cause from 1 January was available for each year of the 2015-2020 period. Data were stratified by municipality, sex and 21 age categories. The third data release (R3) included 1,686 of the 7,904 Italian municipalities with increased mortality in 2020, covering about 40% of the Italian population. Results were compared with those obtainable with the fifth data release (R5), made available in June, when the selection of the municipalities was no longer based on increased mortality and which included more than 90% of the Italian population. R5 was considered the gold standard. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: excess of deaths from any cause in the Italian provinces between 1 March and 4 April; relative risk (RR); permutation p-values; permutation-based adjusted relative risk; population coverage. RESULTS: the results of this study, which are based on two different test statistics, identify 17 and 33 provinces (out of 103) with increased overall mortality, respectively, controlling the family-wise error rate at 0.05 level. Most of the identified provinces are neighbouring provinces in the northern regions of Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont, Liguria, Marche and Tuscany, where most of the COVID-19 cases and deaths were identified. The comparison with data from R5 shows that all the identified provinces had an increase in overall mortality, mostly (31/34) above 25%. On average, the adjusted RR slightly underestimates the RR from R5, underestimating the large RR and overestimating the small RR. CONCLUSIONS: this was, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first attempt to aggregate the Istat data at province level and obtain a reliable and generalizable statistical inference. This permutation-based approach provides a feasible approach to take into account the selection bias that was present in the data and could be used for analysing other types of data that present some type of selection bias.","Lusa, Lara",Epidemiol Prev,,446
279352,Can lung ultrasound predict histologic pattern of lung injury in critically ill patients with COVID-19? Author's reply,2021,"Active inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), combined immunosuppression and corticosteroid therapy have all been identified as risk factors for a poor outcome in COVID-19 infection. The management of patients with both COVID-19 infection and active IBD is therefore complex. We present the case of a 31-year-old patient with Crohn's disease, on dual immunosuppression with infliximab and mercaptopurine presenting with inflammatory small bowel obstruction and COVID-19 infection. The case highlights the use of nutritional therapy, which remains underused in the management of adults with IBD, to manage his flare acutely. Following negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and SARS-CoV-2 IgG testing confirming an antibody response, ustekinumab (anti-interleukin 12/23) was prescribed for long-term maintenance.","Harris, Clare; Harris, Richard James; Downey, Louise; Gwiggner, Markus",BMJ case reports,,446
279894,Effects of Covid-19 on Heart Failure Admissions in Nyc,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused a global pandemic since December 2020. It has not only associated with physiological disorder but also with psychological distress and symptoms of mental illness. Whether the vaccines and antivirals can provide protects remains unknown. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is recommended as an alternative and significant way of preventing and treating COVID-19 in China. However, few studies have assessed the benefits of this treatment and mental health after they recover. Our study is designed to investigate effects and safety when using TCM on the course of this disease and the impact of COVID-19 on pandemic-related anxiety. METHOD: For this prospective cohort study, we will enroll 300 COVID-19 patients aged 18 to 80 years at 4 centers. We divide them into 2 groups, according to whether they use Baidu Jieduan Granule at a ratio of 1:1. We will compare treatments combined Baidu Jieduan Granule with conventional Western medicine (experimental group) vs treatment of conventional Western medicine only (control group). The basic information of patients including demographic, general condition, primary diseases, and complications will be assessed. Related examines will be conducted at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days. The primary outcomes are clinical outcome. A follow-up time of 1 year (to June 30, 2021) allow us to evaluate the psychiatric disorder after recovery. We will monitor adverse events throughout the trial. DISCUSSION: It will be the first prospective cohort study which uses Baidu Jieduan Granule, based on the innovation traditional Chinese medicine strategy of "" Internal and External Relieving -Truncated Torsion "" to treat the common type of COVID-19. The result of this study may provide evidence-based recommendations of TCM for treatment and psychological distress or symptoms of mental illness of the common type of COVID-19.","Wu, Xinxin; Lu, Wei; Guo, Quan; Cao, Min; Zhang, Wen; Liu, Changya; Qu, Yao; Peng, Wei; Che, Jinhua; Fang, Bangjiang; Zhou, Shuang",Medicine (Baltimore),,446

Methods: Retrospective analysis of all deliveries in Covid-19-infected mothers in a tertiary care centre in North Kerala from 15 April 2020 to 15 October 2020. Results: Of the 350 Covid-19-positive pregnancies 223 delivered, two were intrauterine foetal demises. In total, 32 out of 221 newborns were Covid-19-positive (14.47%). The risk was more in vaginal delivery group (17.39%) compared to caesarean group (13.16%). The breastfeeding and rooming-in group (18.79%) had more infection than those babies who were not breastfed and separated from mother (1.78%).14 out of 86 (16.28%) babies delivered within 7 days of mothers turning negative became positive compared to 2 out of 23 (8.7%) babies delivered between 7 and 14 days of negative result (Odds ratio of 2.04). None of the babies delivered 14 days after negative result has become positive. Conclusions: The present study shows that neonatal Covid-19 infection is not rare. The risk is greater in vaginal delivery group and those babies who are breastfed and allowed to stay with mothers. Delaying delivery more than 7 days after mother becoming negative protects the newborn from getting infection.","Ajith, S; Reshmi, V P; Nambiar, Sabnam; Naser, Ashitha; Athulya, B",J Obstet Gynaecol India,,446

282083,Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of hospital mortality in patients with Covid-19: Systematic review with meta-analysis,2020,"OBJECTIVES: One major goal of the emergency department (ED) is to decide, whether patients need to be hospitalised or can be sent home safely. We aim at providing criteria for these decisions without knowing the SARS-CoV-2 test result in suspected cases. SETTING: Tertiary emergency medicine. PARTICIPANTS: All patients were treated at the ED of the Charité during the pandemic peak and underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing. Patients with positive test results were characterised in detail and underwent a 14-day-follow-up. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Logistic regression and classification and regression tree (CART) analyses were performed to identify predictors (primary endpoint), which confirm safe discharge. The clinical endpoint was all-cause mortality or need for mechanical ventilation during index stay or after readmission. RESULTS: The primary test population of suspected COVID-19 consisted of n=1255 cases, 45.2% were women (n=567). Of these, n=110 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (8.8%). The median age of SARS-CoV-2-positive cases was 45 years (IQR: 33-66 years), whereas the median age of the group tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 was 42 years (IQR: 30-60 years) (p=0.096). 43.6% were directly admitted to hospital care.CART analysis identified the variables oxygen saturation (<95%), dyspnoea and history of cardiovascular (CV) disease to distinguish between high and low-risk groups. If all three variables were negative, most patients were discharged from ED, and the incidence of the clinical endpoint was 0%. The validation cohort confirmed the safety of discharge using these variables and revealed an incidence of the clinical endpoint from 14.3% in patients with CV disease, 9.4% in patients with dyspnoea and 18.2% in patients with O2 satuaration below 95%. CONCLUSIONS: Based on easily available variables like dyspnoea, oxygen saturation, history of CV disease, approximately 25% of patients subsequently confirmed with COVID-19 can be identified for safe discharge.

287125,A preliminary systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials of cognitive remediation therapy for anorexia nervosa,2020,"The emerging Coronavirus Disease pandemic caused by Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is a serious public health issue due to its rapid spreading, high mortality rate and lack of specific treatment. Provided its unpredictable clinical course, risk assessment and stratification for severity of COVID-19 are required. Apart from serving as admission criteria, prognostic factors might guide future therapeutic strategies. We aimed to compare clinical features and biological parameters between elderly (age ≥65 years) and non-elderly (age&lt;65 years) patients with COVID-19 and new neurological symptoms/conditions. We also aimed to determine factors independently associated with all-cause in-hospital mortality. All consecutive patients with COVID-19 and new neurological symptoms/conditions admitted in our Neurology Department between April 1 and August 23, 2020 were enrolled in this observational retrospective cohort study. Patient characteristics such as demographic data, comorbidities, biological parameters, imaging findings and clinical course were recorded. All-cause in-hospital mortality was the main outcome, whereas COVID-19 severity, hospitalization duration and the levels of supplemental oxygen were the secondary outcomes. One hundred forty-eight patients were included, out of which 54.1% were women. The average age was 59.84±19.06 years and 47.3% were elderly, the majority having cardiovascular and metabolic comorbidities. In the elderly group, the most frequent neurological symptoms/manifestations responsible for hospitalization were stroke symptoms followed by confusion, whereas in the non-elderly headache prevailed. The final neurological diagnosis significantly varied between the two groups, with acute cerebrovascular events and acute confusional state in dementia most commonly encountered in the elderly and secondary headache attributed to SARS-CoV-2 infection often experienced by the non-elderly. The elderly had statistically significant higher median value of white blood cell and neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, ferritin, fibrinogen, D-dimer, prothrombin time, aspartate transaminase, creatinine and blood urea nitrogen level, as well as lower median value of hemoglobin and lymphocyte count. Moreover, advanced age was significantly associated with more extensive lung involvement and higher fatality rate. Overall, the mortality rate was 23.6%. Older age, higher neutrophil count, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen and activated partial thromboplastin time levels are independent predictors of mortality in COVID-19 patients with new neurological manifestations/conditions at admission.","Davidescu, Eugenia Irene Odajiu Irina Tulbǎ Delia Sandu Constantin Dragoş Bunea Teodora Sandu Georgiana Mureşanu Dafin Fior Bǎlǎnescu Paul Popescu Bogdan Ovidiu",Frontiers in Aging Neuroscience,,446

They tend to depict people saying and doing things that they did not actually say or do. In the news media and the blogosphere, the worry has been raised that, as a result of deepfakes, we are heading toward an ""infopocalypse"" where we cannot tell what is real from what is not. Several philosophers (e.g., Deborah Johnson, Luciano Floridi, Regina Rini) have now issued similar warnings. In this paper, I offer an analysis of why deepfakes are such a serious threat to knowledge. Utilizing the account of information carrying recently developed by Brian Skyrms (2010), I argue that deepfakes reduce the amount of information that videos carry to viewers. I conclude by drawing some implications of this analysis for addressing the epistemic threat of deepfakes.","Fallis, Don",Philos Technol,,446

It is very important to test and isolate people to reduce spread, and from here comes the need to do this quickly and efficiently. According to some studies, Chest-CT outperforms RT-PCR lab testing, which is the current standard, when diagnosing COVID-19 patients. Due to this, computer vision researchers have developed various deep learning systems that can predict COVID-19 using a Chest-CT scan correctly to a certain degree. The accuracy of these systems is limited since deep learning neural networks such as CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) need a significantly large quantity of data for training in order to produce good quality results. Since the disease is relatively recent and more focus has been on CXR (Chest XRay) images, the available chest CT Scan image dataset is much less. We propose a method, by utilizing GANs, to generate synthetic chest CT images of both positive and negative COVID-19 patients. Using a pre-built predictive model, we concluded that around 40% of the generated images are correctly predicted as COVID-19 positive. The dataset thus generated can be used to train a CNN-based classifier which can help determine COVID-19 in a patient with greater accuracy.","Mann, Prerak; Jain, Sahaj; Mittal, Saurabh; Bhat, Aruna",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.11241v1.pdf,446

To curb the spreading of the virus, WHO urgently demanded an extension of screening and testing; thus, a rapid and simple diagnostic method is needed. We applied a reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to achieve the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 30 min. We designed four sets of LAMP primers (6 primers in each set), targeting the viral RNA of SARS-CoV-2 in the regions of orf1ab, S gene and N gene. A colorimetric change was used to report the results, which enables the outcome of viral RNA amplification to be read by the naked eye without the need of expensive or dedicated instrument. The sensitivity can be 80 copies of viral RNA per ml in a sample. We validated the RT-LAMP method in a hospital in China, employing 16 clinic samples with 8 positives and 8 negatives. The testing results are consistent with the conventional RT-qPCR. In addition, we also show that one-step process without RNA extraction is feasible to achieve RNA amplification directly from a sample. This rapid, simple and sensitive RT-LAMP method paves a way for a large screening at public domain and hospitals, particularly regional hospitals and medical centres in rural areas.","Huang, Wei E; Lim, Boon; Hsu, Chia-Chen; Xiong, Dan; Wu, Wei; Yu, Yejiong; Jia, Huidong; Wang, Yun; Zeng, Yida; Ji, Mengmeng; Chang, Hong; Zhang, Xiuming; Wang, Hui; Cui, Zhanfeng",Microb Biotechnol,,446

Not always! the novel coronavirus covid-19 outbreak",2020,"OBJECTIVES: We conducted an analytic and clinical comparison of a novel high-definition polymerase chain reaction PCR (HDPCR) assay to traditional real-time PCR (RT-PCR) for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in upper respiratory specimens. METHODS: Analytic performance of RT-PCR, HDPCR, and extraction-free HDPCR was established through replicate testing of a serially diluted clinical specimen containing SARS-CoV-2. A clinical comparison of all 3 assays was conducted using 351 prospectively collected upper respiratory swab specimens obtained from symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals collected in various transport media. RESULTS: RT-PCR and HDPCR assays using extracted nucleic acid demonstrated similar analytic limits of detection (LoD) and clinical performance, with 100% positive and negative agreement. Extraction-free HDPCR demonstrated a 1.5 to 2.0 log10 increase in LoD based on cycle threshold values. However, clinical performance of extraction-free HDPCR remained high, demonstrating 97.8% positive and 99.6% negative agreement with RT-PCR. An overall increase in ""invalid"" and ""presumptive"" results was observed when using the extraction-free method, but this was highly variable based on transport medium used. CONCLUSIONS: HDPCR performs similar to RT-PCR for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. The use of an extraction-free HDPCR protocol maintained high clinical performance despite reduced analytic LoD, with the benefit of reduced hands-on time and cost of reagents associated with nucleic acid extraction.","Buchan, Blake W; Gerstbrein, Derek; Cruz, Amorina; Hoff, Jess; Sievert, Emily; Ledeboer, Nathan A; Faron, Matthew L",Am J Clin Pathol,,446
293597,Characteristics and outcomes of in-hospital cardiac arrest in COVID-19. A systematic review and meta-analysis,2021,"BACKGROUND: When vaccination depends on injection, it is plausible that the blood-injection-injury cluster of fears may contribute to hesitancy. Our primary aim was to estimate in the UK adult population the proportion of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy explained by blood-injection-injury fears. METHODS: In total, 15 014 UK adults, quota sampled to match the population for age, gender, ethnicity, income and region, took part (19 January-5 February 2021) in a non-probability online survey. The Oxford COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy Scale assessed intent to be vaccinated. Two scales (Specific Phobia Scale-blood-injection-injury phobia and Medical Fear Survey-injections and blood subscale) assessed blood-injection-injury fears. Four items from these scales were used to create a factor score specifically for injection fears. RESULTS: In total, 3927 (26.2%) screened positive for blood-injection-injury phobia. Individuals screening positive (22.0%) were more likely to report COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy compared to individuals screening negative (11.5%), odds ratio = 2.18, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.97-2.40, p < 0.001. The population attributable fraction (PAF) indicated that if blood-injection-injury phobia were absent then this may prevent 11.5% of all instances of vaccine hesitancy, AF = 0.11; 95% CI 0.09-0.14, p < 0.001. COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was associated with higher scores on the Specific Phobia Scale, r = 0.22, p < 0.001, Medical Fear Survey, r = 0.23, p = <0.001 and injection fears, r = 0.25, p < 0.001. Injection fears were higher in youth and in Black and Asian ethnic groups, and explained a small degree of why vaccine hesitancy is higher in these groups. CONCLUSIONS: Across the adult population, blood-injection-injury fears may explain approximately 10% of cases of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.

The triple movement is offered by Nancy Fraser to revisit Karl Polanyi’s conception of the double-movement from a feminist perspective. It encompasses not only marketization and social protection, but also emancipation from social relations and markets. The article applies this concept to an understanding of remittance-driven labor exports and the formation of transnational households as an emerging institution of social protection. The discussion focuses on labor as a globalized fictitious commodity, global care chains, and the effects of COVID-19. The article points to the centrality of social subordination in marketization of remittances and labor, as well as to the fragility of this approach to social provisioning. © 2021, Journal of Economic Issues / Association for Evolutionary Economics.","Khanal, K.; Todorova, Z.",Journal of Economic Issues,,446

Currently, health technology assessment (HTA) tends to be static and a priori: alternatives are compared before launch, and little evaluation occurs after implementation. We suggest a method that builds upon the current pre-launch HTA procedures by conceptualizing a mean-variance approach to the continuous evaluation of attainable portfolios of interventions in health systems. Our framework uses frontier analysis to identify the desirability of available health interventions so decision makers can choose diverse portfolios based upon information about expected returns and risks. This approach facilitates the extension of existing methods and assessments beyond the traditional concern with pre-adoption data, a much-needed innovation given the challenges posed by COVID-19.","Baines, Darrin; Disegna, Marta; Hartwell, Christopher A",Soc Sci Med,,446

299528,"Modified minimal-contact COVID-19 workflow allows for safe, remote parenteral nutrition prescribing in non-critically ill patients",2021,"One of the main causes of death in COVID-19 is the dysregulation of the host's immune system which leads to cytokine storm, a potentially fatal systemic inflammatory syndrome. Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is produced in response to infections and tissue injuries and is believed to play a pivotal role in the event of a cytokine storm, as signified by its increase in the process. Considering the role of IL-6 as a pro-inflammatory cytokine in the process of cytokine storm in COVID-19, perceiving IL-6 as a therapeutic target could prove to be promising. Tocilizumab is a monoclonal antibody that competitively inhibits the binding of IL-6 to its receptor (IL-6R). The use of IL-6R blocker is recommended for severe COVID-19 patients in the latest therapeutic guideline published by the World Health Organization (WHO), but the timing of the administration has not been specified. While previous studies about the use of tocilizumab in COVID-19 patients have shown various results, these studies do not emphasize on plasma IL-6 levels when deciding the time of tocilizumab administration. In this case series, we present three patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 infections that receive tocilizumab as an adjunct to the standard of care therapy. This case series introduces the novel idea that the timely use of tocilizumab as signified by plasma IL-6 levels in moderate to severe COVID-19 patients could potentially improve overall clinical condition and increase survival rate.","Tenda, E.

299888,Regional differences in hospital admissions for ST-elevation and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarctions during the Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic in Austria,2020,"With the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), medical providers should take care to prevent the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals including super-spreading. Understanding super-spreading would be useful to reduce future transmission. Some publications have shown clusters of SARS-CoV-2 such as at choir practice and in hospitals. Aerosol can be considered as a primary transmission route. As SARS-CoV-2 stability in aerosol is similar to SARS-CoV-1 with the higher reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV-1, another factor causes rapidly spread-out, e.g. a higher discharge ratio from infected people or a higher viral intake ratio to human body. A basic research suggests higher infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in the nose than the peripheral lung. Universal masking would be important to prevent the exposure of SARS-CoV-2 droplet to uninfected people. To detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, laboratory tests such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays are applied. Although sensitivity and specificity are provided for the ability of the test, positive or negative prediction values are useful to indicate the possiblity of infection or non-infection in clinical practice. We have to realize that the positive and negative prediction values depend on the sensitivity, specificity, and infection probability of the patient.","Masui, Kenichi",J. anesth,,446

The most common molecular tests approved by regulatory bodies across the world for COVID-19 diagnosis are based on Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). While PCR-based tests are highly sensitive, specific, and remarkably reliable, they have many limitations ranging from the requirement of sophisticated laboratories, need of skilled personnel, use of complex protocol, long wait times for results, and an overall high cost per test. These limitations have inspired researchers to search for alternative diagnostic methods that are fast, economical, and executable in low-resource laboratory settings. The discovery of Loop-mediated isothermal Amplification (LAMP) has provided a reliable substitute platform for the accurate detection of low copy number nucleic acids in the diagnosis of several viral diseases, including epidemics like Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). At present, a cocktail of LAMP assay reagents along with reverse transcriptase enzyme (Reverse Transcription LAMP, RT-LAMP) can be a robust solution for the rapid and cost-effective diagnosis for COVID-19, particularly in developing, and low-income countries. In summary, the development of RT-LAMP based diagnostic tools in a paper/strip format or the integration of this method into a microfluidic platform such as a Lab-on-a-chip may revolutionize the concept of PoCT for COVID-19 diagnosis. This review discusses the principle, technology and past research underpinning the success for using this method for diagnosing MERS and SARS, in addition to ongoing research, and the prominent prospect of RT-LAMP in the context of COVID-19 diagnosis.","Augustine, Robin; Hasan, Anwarul; Das, Suvarthi; Ahmed, Rashid; Mori, Yasuyoshi; Notomi, Tsugunori; Kevadiya, Bhavesh D; S Thakor, Avnesh",,,446

Apart from ACE-2, recently EMMPRIN, has been regarded as a target for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) attachment and entry into the host cell. Since one of the routes of entry for the virus is the oral cavity, it becomes imperative to percept oral comorbidities such oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) in terms of EMMPRIN as a target for SARS-CoV-2. In the present paper, it is proposed that OSCC, by the virtue of upregulation of EMMPRIN expression, increases the susceptibility to coronavirus disease (COVID-19). In turn, COVID-19 in OSCC patients causes exhaustion of EMMPRIN receptor due to binding with 'S' receptor leading to a downregulation of related carcinogenesis events. We proposed that in the ACE-2 depleted situation in OSCC, EMMPRIN receptor might get high jacked by the COVID-19 virus for the entry into the host cells. Apart from the anti-monoclonal antibody, it is recommended to explore the use of grape seed and skin containing mouthwash as an adjunct, which could also have anti EMMPRIN effects in patients with OSCC and OPMDs.","Varadarajan, Saranya; Balaji, Thodur Madapusi; Sarode, Sachin C; Sarode, Gargi S; Sharma, Nilesh K; Gondivkar, Shailesh; Gadbail, Amol; Patil, Shankargouda",Med Hypotheses,,446

We aimed to determine whether colchicine is effective at reducing time to recovery and COVID-19 related hospitalisations/deaths among people in the community. DesignProspective, multicentre, open-label, multi-arm, adaptive Platform Randomised Trial of Treatments in the Community for Epidemic and Pandemic Illnesses (PRINCIPLE). SettingNational trial run remotely from a central trial site and at multiple primary care centres across the United Kingdom. ParticipantsAdults aged [≥]65, or [≥]18 years with comorbidities or shortness of breath, and unwell [≤]14 days with suspected COVID-19 in the community. InterventionsParticipants were randomised to usual care, usual care plus colchicine (500{micro}g daily for 14 days), or usual care plus other interventions. Main outcome measuresThe co-primary endpoints were time to first self-reported recovery, and hospitalisation/death related to COVID-19, within 28 days, analysed using Bayesian models. The hypothesis for the time to recovery endpoint is evaluated first, and if superiority is declared on time to recovery, the hypothesis for the second co-primary endpoint of hospitalisation/death is then evaluated. To determine futility, we pre-specified a clinically meaningful benefit in time to first reported recovery as a hazard ratio of 1.2 or larger (equating to approximately 1.5 days benefit in the colchicine arm, assuming 9 days recovery in the usual care arm). ResultsThe trial opened on April 2, 2020, with randomisation to colchicine starting on March 04, 2021 and stopping on May 26, 2021, because the pre-specified time to recovery futility criterion was met. The primary analysis model included 2755 SARS-CoV-2 positive participants, randomised to colchicine (n=156), usual care (n=1145), and other treatments (n=1454). Time to first self-reported recovery was similar in the colchicine group compared with usual care with an estimated hazard ratio of 0.919 [95% credible interval 0.72 to 1.16] and an estimated increase of 1.14 days [-1.86 to 5.21] in median time to self-reported recovery for colchicine versus usual care. The probability of meaningful benefit in time to recovery was very low at 1.8%. Results were similar in comparisons with concurrent controls. COVID-19 related hospitalisations/deaths were similar in the colchicine group versus usual care, with an estimated odds ratio of 0.76 [0.28 to 1.89] and an estimated difference of -0.4% [-2.7% to 2.4].

The model allows for a time varying transmission rate which we use to incorporate the measures introduced by the government over the period of one semester. The model predicts that by mid November 2020, the city will need 1362 ICU beds and more than 9000 regular hospital beds. The number of active cases will be 67,866 by then and the death toll will reach 13,268 people by the end of December. We provide a Shiny app available at https://claudia-rivera-rodriguez.shinyapps.io/shinyappcovidclinic/. The original values in the app reproduce the results of this paper, but the parameters and starting values can be changed according to the user's needs. COVID-19 has posed too many challenges to health systems around the globe. This model is a useful tool for cities, hospitals and clinics in Colombia that need to be prepared for the excess demand of services that a pandemic like this one generates. Unfortunately, the model predicts that by mid-November the projected capacity of the system in Bogotá will not be enough. We expect the lockdown rules to be strengthened in future days, so the death toll will not be as bad as predicted by this model.","Rivera-Rodriguez, Claudia; Urdinola, Beatriz Piedad",Front Public Health,,446
322323,Rate of Intensive Care Unit admission and outcomes among patients with coronavirus: A systematic review and Meta-analysis,2020,"PURPOSE: Primary objective of this study was to identify potential difficulties and/or discomfort when using a facemask. Moreover, to explore the impact of spectacles, contact lenses and visual acuity on the compliance to the facemask directive. METHODS: This is a prospective study that was conducted at the Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital of Alexandroupolis, Greece between June 2020 and August 2020. Greek speaking citizens with permanent residency in Greece above 18 years old were included. A custom questionnaire (DeMask-20) was constructed and validated, which pertained to the perceived difficulty and discomfort when using a facemask. It contained 20 items grouped in 8 subscales (driving, near vision, distance vision, ocular discomfort, role limitation, collaboration, dependency on others, emotional stress). Perceived difficulty and discomfort when using a facemask, compliance and correlations of compliance with DeMask-20 scores, demographics, spectacle and/or contact lens use, and visual acuity were evaluated. RESULTS: The number of factors was determined through factor analysis. Cronbach's alpha ranged from 0.716 for the ""Role limitation"" subscale to 0.938 for ""Ocular discomfort"" subscale. 1,214 participants (402 men, 812 women, mean age 36.79±12.50 years) completed the DeMask-20 instrument. Mean DeMask-20 score of all study participants was 3.79±0.71. Significant differences in DeMask-20 score were detected in gender (p = 0.009), spectacle use (p = 0.034), contact lens use (p = 0.049), and binocular distance visual acuity (bDVA) (p = 0.001). Mean compliance of all participants was 4.05±0.96. Men, people <50 years and spectacle wearers showed significantly worse compliance (p<0.05). Moreover, professional workers and professional drivers demonstrated significantly better compliance (p = 0.008 and p = 0.047). Significant correlation was detected between compliance and DeMask-20 score (p<0.001, R2 = 0.471). Significant correlations were detected with driving, near vision, distance vision, collaboration, role limitation, emotional stress (p<0.05, R2: 0.386-0.493). CONCLUSIONS: Factor analysis suggested that the DeMask-20 instrument demonstrates adequate validity, while Cronbach's alpha indicated sufficient internal consistency of all subscales. This study provided the necessary methods that could evaluate compliance trends and the efficacy of healthcare interventions against COVID-19. Our outcomes suggest that young males who use spectacles should be targeted by Greek Healthcare authorities in order to improve compliance rates.","Labiris, Georgios; Panagiotopoulou, Eirini-Kanella; Perente, Asli; Chatzimichael, Eleftherios; Fotiadis, Ioannis; Taliantzis, Sergios; Konstantinidis, Aristeidis; Dardabounis, Doukas",PLoS One,,446

323959,Evaluation of organizational and social commitments and related factors during the coronavirus pandemic of healthcare workers in northern Iran,2021,"A primary indicator of success in the fight against COVID-19 is avoiding stress on critical care infrastructure and services (CCIS). However, CCIS will likely remain stressed until sustained herd immunity is built. There are also secondary considerations for success: mitigating economic damage; curbing the spread of misinformation, improving morale, and preserving a sense of control; building global trust for diplomacy, trade and travel; and restoring reliability and normalcy to day-to-day life, among others. We envision technology plays a pivotal role. Here, we focus on the effective use of readily available technology to improve the primary and secondary success criteria for the fight against SARS-CoV-2. In a multifaceted technology approach, we start with effective technology use for remote patient monitoring (RPM) of COVID-19 with the following objectives: 1. Deploy readily available technology for continuous real-time remote monitoring of patient vitals with the help of biosensors on a large scale. 2. Effective and safe remote large-scale communitywide care of low-severity cases as a buffer against surges in COVID-19 hospitalizations to reduce strain on critical care services and emergency hospitals. 3. Improve the patient, their family, and their community's sense of control and morale. 4. Propose a clear technology and medical definition of remote patient monitoring for COVID-19 to address an urgent technology need; address obfuscated, narrow, and erroneous information and provide examples; and urge publishers to be clear and complete in their disclosures. 5. Leverage the cloud-based distributed cognitive RPM platform for community leaders and decision makers to enable planning and resource management, pandemic research, damage prevention and containment, and receiving feedback on strategies and executions.","Nesarikar, Ashlesha; Haque, Waqas; Vuppala, Suchith; Nesarikar, Abhijit",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.12312v1.pdf,446
324995,A year in review in Minerva Anestesiologica 2020: critical care,2021,"BACKGROUND: In South Korea, the number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases has declined rapidly and much sooner than in other countries. South Korea is one of the most digitalized countries in the world, and YouTube may have served as a rapid delivery mechanism for increasing public awareness of COVID-19. Thus, the platform may have helped the South Korean public fight the spread of the disease. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare the reliability, overall quality, title-content consistency, and content coverage of Korean-language YouTube videos on COVID-19, which have been uploaded by different sources. METHODS: A total of 200 of the most viewed YouTube videos from January 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020, were screened, searching in Korean for the terms ""Coronavirus,"" ""COVID,"" ""Corona,"" ""Wuhan virus,"" and ""Wuhan pneumonia."" Non-Korean videos and videos that were duplicated, irrelevant, or livestreamed were excluded. Source and video metrics were collected. The videos were scored based on the following criteria: modified DISCERN index, Journal of the American Medical Association Score (JAMAS) benchmark criteria, global quality score (GQS), title-content consistency index (TCCI), and medical information and content index (MICI). RESULTS: Of the 105 total videos, 37.14% (39/105) contained misleading information; independent user-generated videos showed the highest proportion of misleading information at 68.09% (32/47), while all of the government-generated videos were useful. Government agency-generated videos achieved the highest median score of DISCERN (5.0, IQR 5.0-5.0), JAMAS (4.0, IQR 4.0-4.0), GQS (4.0, IQR 3.0-4.5), and TCCI (5.0, IQR 5.0-5.0), while independent user-generated videos achieved the lowest median score of DISCERN (2.0, IQR 1.0-3.0), JAMAS (2.0, IQR 1.5-2.0), GQS (2.0, IQR 1.5-2.0), and TCCI (3.0, IQR 3.0-4.0). However, the total MICI was not significantly different among sources. ""Transmission and precautionary measures"" were the most commonly covered content by government agencies, news agencies, and independent users. In contrast, the most mentioned content by news agencies was ""prevalence,"" followed by ""transmission and precautionary measures."" CONCLUSIONS: Misleading videos had more likes, fewer comments, and longer running times than useful videos. Korean-language YouTube videos on COVID-19 uploaded by different sources varied significantly in terms of reliability, overall quality, and title-content consistency, but the content coverage was not significantly different. Government-generated videos had higher reliability, overall quality, and title-content consistency than independent user-generated videos.","Moon, Hana; Lee, Geon Ho",J Med Internet Res,,446
325107,"The importance of a ""socially responsible"" approach during COVID-19: the invisible heroes of science in Italy",2020,"This paper provides a formal evaluation of the predictive performance of a model (and its various updates) developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) for predicting daily deaths attributed to COVID19 for each state in the United States. The IHME models have received extensive attention in social and mass media, and have influenced policy makers at the highest levels of the United States government. For effective policy making the accurate assessment of uncertainty, as well as accurate point predictions, are necessary because the risks inherent in a decision must be taken into account, especially in the present setting of a novel disease affecting millions of lives. To assess the accuracy of the IHME models, we examine both forecast accuracy as well as the predictive performance of the 95% prediction intervals provided by the IHME models. We find that the initial IHME model underestimates the uncertainty surrounding the number of daily deaths substantially. Specifically, the true number of next day deaths fell outside the IHME prediction intervals as much as 70% of the time, in comparison to the expected value of 5%. In addition, we note that the performance of the initial model does not improve with shorter forecast horizons. Regarding the updated models, our analyses indicate that the later models do not show any improvement in the accuracy of the point estimate predictions. In fact, there is some evidence that this accuracy has actually decreased over the initial models. Moreover, when considering the updated models, while we observe a larger percentage of states having actual values lying inside the 95% prediction intervals (PI), our analysis suggests that this observation may be attributed to the widening of the PIs. The width of these intervals calls into question the usefulness of the predictions to drive policy making and resource allocation.","Marchant, Roman; Samia, Noelle I.; Rosen, Ori; Tanner, Martin A.; Cripps, Sally",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04734v3.pdf,446

Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the temporal patterns and predict of occurrence of VL in Ardabil Province, in northwestern Iran using autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models. Methods: This descriptive study employed yearly and monthly data of 602 cases of VLH in the province between January 2000 to December 2019, which was provided by the leishmaniasis national surveillance system. The monthly occurrences case constructed the ARIMA model of time-series model. The insignificance of the correlation in the lags of 12, 24 and 36 months, and Chi-square test showed the occurrence of VLH does not have a seasonal pattern. Eleven potential ARIMA models were examined for VLH cases. Finally, the best model was selected with the lower Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) value. Then, the selected model was used to forecast frequency of monthly occurrences case. The forecasting precision was estimated by mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Data analysis was performed using Stata14 and its package time series analysis. Results: ARIMA (5, 0, 1) model with AIC (25.7) and BIC (43.35) was selected.

No data exist regarding its impact on PM2.5 pollution. We aimed to assess PM2.5 levels before, during, and after lockdown (7 March 2020-16 May 2020) in Volos, one of Greece's most polluted industrialized cities, and compare PM2.5 levels with those obtained during the same period last year. Meteorological conditions were examined as confounders. METHODS: The study period was discriminated into three phases (pre-lockdown: 7 March-9 March, lockdown: 10 March-4 May, and post-lockdown period: 5 May-16 May). A wireless sensors network was used to collect PM2.5, temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wind speed data every 2 s. RESULTS: The lockdown resulted in a significant drop of PM2.5 by 37.4% in 2020, compared to 2019 levels. The mean daily concentrations of PM2.5 exceeded the WHO's guideline value for 24-h mean levels of PM2.5 35% of the study period. During the strictest lockdown (23 March to 4 May), the mean daily PM2.5 levels exceeded the standard 41% of the time. The transition from the pre-lockdown period into lockdown or post-lockdown periods was associated with lower PM2.5 concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: A reduction in the mean daily PM2.5 concentration was found compared to 2019. Lockdown was not enough to avoid severe exceedances of air pollution in Volos.","Kotsiou, Ourania S; Saharidis, Georgios K D; Kalantzis, Georgios; Fradelos, Evangelos C; Gourgoulianis, Konstantinos I",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,446

Serological tests that identify past infection can be used to estimate cumulative incidence, but the relative accuracy and robustness of various sampling strategies have been unclear. We developed a flexible framework that integrates uncertainty from test characteristics, sample size, and heterogeneity in seroprevalence across subpopulations to compare estimates from sampling schemes. Using the same framework and making the assumption that seropositivity indicates immune protection, we propagated estimates and uncertainty through dynamical models to assess uncertainty in the epidemiological parameters needed to evaluate public health interventions and found that sampling schemes informed by demographics and contact networks outperform uniform sampling. The framework can be adapted to optimize serosurvey design given test characteristics and capacity, population demography, sampling strategy, and modeling approach, and can be tailored to support decision-making around introducing or removing interventions.","Larremore, Daniel B; Fosdick, Bailey K; Bubar, Kate M; Zhang, Sam; Kissler, Stephen M; Metcalf, C Jessica E; Buckee, Caroline O; Grad, Yonatan H",eLife (Cambridge),,446

This suggests that we might understand the elevation of “deal-making” to a lifestyle as a characteristic of modernity that, with neoliberalism, is increasingly coming to the fore. Such a critique of modernity, I further argue, is anticipated by Fichte’s Closed Commercial State with its intriguing dialectic of risk. I conclude by arguing that Trump’s politics marks the rise of a new, specifically American style of Fascism—one that demands identification not with the state as supra-individual collective, but with an impersonal system governing over individual lives and rendering them precarious.","Adler, Anthony Curtis",Fudan J.

This study analyzes the complete outbreak data from Wuhan, assesses the impact of these public health interventions, and estimates the asymptomatic, undetected and total cases for the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan. METHODS: By taking different stages of the outbreak into account, we developed a time-dependent compartmental model to describe the dynamics of disease transmission and case detection and reporting. Model coefficients were parameterized by using the reported cases and following key events and escalated control strategies. Then the model was used to calibrate the complete outbreak data by using the Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) method. Finally we used the model to estimate asymptomatic and undetected cases and approximate the overall antibody prevalence level. RESULTS: We found that the transmission rate between Jan 24 and Feb 1, 2020, was twice as large as that before the lockdown on Jan 23 and 67.6% (95% CI [0.584,0.759]) of detectable infections occurred during this period. Based on the reported estimates that around 20% of infections were asymptomatic and their transmission ability was about 70% of symptomatic ones, we estimated that there were about 14,448 asymptomatic and undetected cases (95% CI [12,364,23,254]), which yields an estimate of a total of 64,454 infected cases (95% CI [62,370,73,260]), and the overall antibody prevalence level in the population of Wuhan was 0.745% (95% CI [0.693%,0.814%]) by March 31, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan was achieved via the enforcement of a combination of multiple NPIs: the lockdown on Jan 23, the stay-at-home order on Feb 2, the massive isolation of all symptomatic individuals via newly constructed special shelter hospitals on Feb 6, and the large scale screening process on Feb 18. Our results indicate that the population in Wuhan is far away from establishing herd immunity and provide insights for other affected countries and regions in designing control strategies and planing vaccination programs.","Huo, Xi; Chen, Jing; Ruan, Shigui",BMC Infect Dis,,446

Methods: A systematic search was performed in PubMed and Embase and gray literature up to September 19, 2020. A random-effects model was applied to obtain the pooled prevalence of disease recurrence among recovered patients and the prevalence of subjects underlying comorbidity among recurrence cases. The other characteristics were calculated based on the summary data of individual studies. Results: A total of 41 studies were included in the final analysis, we have described the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 recurrence cases. Of 3,644 patients recovering from COVID-19 and being discharged, an estimate of 15% (95% CI, 12% to 19%) patients was re-positive with SARS-CoV-2 during the follow-up. This proportion was 14% (95% CI, 11% to 17%) for China and 31% (95% CI, 26% to 37%) for Korea. Among recurrence cases, it was estimated 39% (95% CI, 31% to 48%) subjects underlying at least one comorbidity. The estimates for times from disease onset to admission, from admission to discharge, and from discharge to RNA positive conversion were 4.8, 16.4, and 10.4 days, respectively. Conclusion: This study summarized up-to-date evidence from case reports, case series, and observational studies for the characteristic of COVID-19 recurrence cases after discharge. It is recommended to pay attention to follow-up patients after discharge, even if they have been in discharge quarantine.","Hoang, Tung",Ann Glob Health,,446

We aimed to describe the course of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in a population of children enrolled by place of residence, from diagnosis to recovery, with a long-term clinical and serological follow-up. We identified patients aged &lt;14 years old living in the Turin Health District 3 who had SARS-CoV-2 detected in at least one nasopharyngeal swab from 1st March to 1st June 2020. Epidemiological and clinical features of SARS-CoV-2 infection were collected by way of a telephone inquiry. Enrolled patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 serology in order to provide evidence of seroconversion and persistence of specific antibodies some time after the infection. A total of 46 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 were identified. The main pattern of viral transmission was intra-family. Eleven children were totally asymptomatic. If symptoms appeared, the disease had a mild course. A single case of COVID-19-related respiratory insufficiency was registered. Among children who underwent serological evaluation, 84% had seroconversion. No significant differences in antibody development were found according to the age and the burden of the disease. Children tested farther from the primary infection had lower antibody index titre values than the others. In conclusion, COVID-19 has a good prognosis in paediatric age. Children are able to develop a valid immune response, although their index titres seem to decrease a long time after the disease.","Calitri, C.; Fantone, F.; Benetti, S.; Lupica, M. M.; Ignaccolo, M.

The initial investigations revealed the cases to be due to a previously unknown ""never before seen strain of coronavirus"". Coronaviruses are a group of viruses, which are normally present among animals such as cows, bats, camels and cats. The disease was officially named COVID-19 by WHO on 11th February 2020. The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses named the virus as SARS-CoV-2 due to its resemblance to SARS coronavirus. According to WHO's Situation Report-28 as of 17th February 2020, globally there were 71,429 confirmed cases, which included both laboratories confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases (applicable only to Hubei province of China). Cases are clinically diagnosed based on their signs and symptoms and chest x-rays without laboratory testing. More than 99% of these are in China i.e. 70,635 and 794 are outside China. The cases reported outside of China belong to 25 countries in various regions of WHO: China having the epicenter of the disease bears the greatest brunt, with 1772 deaths. The three deaths outside China have been reported in Philippines, Japan and France. The case fatality rate of COVID-19 ranges between 2-3% A wide spectrum of disease, ranging from mild to severe, has been reported in confirmed cases of COVID-19.

Governments implemented massive fiscal stimulus and protection packages to counteract these severe consequences which lead them into weak fiscal positions and elevated debt. This affects the fiscal risk to natural hazards governments are exposed to as well. To shed light on this issue we compare fiscal risk due to natural disaster events pre-Covid and for today to indicate the magnitude of change. This is done by applying the so-called CatSim model which combines natural disaster risk and corresponding losses a government is exposed to with financial resources it has available to finance them. While only indicative due to data limitations our results can be interpreted as a warning call to not underestimate disaster risks that can realize any moment and that will be much more difficult to be efficiently responded to compared to the pre-Covid era. Especially the poor are now in a significant weaker position than before. We suggest some possible ways forward how to enable a more integrated perspective and to track progress of fiscal risks over time. © 2021 The Author,"Hochrainer-Stigler, S.",Progress in Disaster Science,,446

We carried out sex-balanced sampling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from confirmed COVID-19 inpatients and outpatients, uninfected close contacts, and healthy controls for 36-color flow cytometry and single cell RNA-sequencing. Our results revealed a pronounced reduction of circulating mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells in infected females. Integration of published COVID-19 airway tissue datasets implicate that this reduction represented a major wave of MAIT cell extravasation during early infection in females. Moreover, female MAIT cells possessed an immunologically active gene signature, whereas male counterparts were pro-apoptotic. Collectively, our findings uncover a female-specific protective MAIT profile, potentially shedding light on reduced COVID-19 susceptibility in females.","Yu, Chen; Littleton, Sejiro; Giroux, Nicholas S; Mathew, Rose; Ding, Shengli; Kalnitsky, Joan; Yang, Yuchen; Petzold, Elizabeth; Chung, Hong A; Rivera, Grecia O; Rotstein, Tomer; Xi, Rui; Ko, Emily R; Tsalik, Ephraim L; Sempowski, Gregory D; Denny, Thomas N; Burke, Thomas W; McClain, Micah T; Woods, Christopher W; Shen, Xiling; Saban, Daniel R",,,446

Methods: This retrospective study examined 61 patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19, as defined by the report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on COVID-19. All patients were admitted to the Department of Infectious Diseases, Wuhan Union Hospital from Dec 28, 2019 to Feb 22, 2020 and classified into a GGO group or a non-GGO group based on CT results. The clinical characteristics and laboratory data of the two groups were compared. Data were analyzed using univariate and multivariate analysis, and using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results: Forty-five patients were in the GGO group (73.8%, 21 females, 24 males, mean age 54.8±17.8 years) and 16 were in the non-GGO group (26.2%, 11 females, 5 males, mean age 53±14.9 years). The levels of IL-2, IL-4, and IFN-Î³ were greater in the GGO group (all P<0.05). ROC analysis indicated that an elevated level of IL-2 was a good predictor of GGO (area under the curve: 0.716, optimal cutoff: 3.205 pg/mL, 53.8% sensitivity, 87.5% specificity, p<0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that IL-2 level was a significant and independent risk factor for lung GGO (OR: 8.167; 95% CI: 1.63, 40.8; P<0.05). Conclusions: There were correlations between GGO in the lungs of patients with moderate-to-severe COVID-19 and the levels of IL-2, IL-4, and INF-Î³. IL-2 was a significant and independent risk factor for GGO. These findings provide a basis for studying the mechanism of pulmonary lesions in COVID-19 patients.","Wu, Zubo; Liu, Xiaoping; Liu, Jie; Zhu, Feng; Liu, Yali; Liu, Yalan; Peng, Hua",Int J Med Sci,,446

In France, while the vaccination campaign is progressing, the French government has decided to remove many public health restrictions such as business closure, lockdowns and curfews. Nonetheless, social distancing, mask wearing, and hand washing (also called barrier gestures) are still recommended. We utilize an age-structured compartmental SEIR model that takes into account SARS-CoV-2 waning immunity, vaccination, and increased transmissibility from variants of concern, to estimate if barrier gestures can be relaxed without causing a resurgence of severe infections. This model assumes that susceptibility to infection is a function of immunity status, which depends on initial infection severity and vaccination status. It is calibrated on confirmed COVID-19 cases from the French surveillance database, and accounts for changes in contact behaviors due to implementation of nation-wide public health policies. We study partial and full relaxation of barrier gestures occurring from August to December 2021 under various immunity duration assumptions. Maintaining application of barrier gestures appears essential to avoid a resurgence of severe infections that would exceed health care capacities, while surmounting vaccine hesitancy represents the key to consider their relaxation. Immunity duration assumptions significantly influence the short-term dynamic of the epidemic which should be considered for further modelling.","Vignals, Carole; Dick, David W; Thiébaut, Rodolphe; Wittkop, Linda; Prague, Mélanie; Heffernan, Jane M",,,446

The PROMISE-EPI study aims to address the latter by identifying HIV infected mothers during an almost never-missed visit for their infant, the second extended program on immunization visit at 6-8 weeks of age (EPI-2). The study is divided into 3 components inclusive of an open-label randomized controlled trial aiming to assess the efficacy of a responsive preventive intervention compared to routine intervention based on the national PMTCT guidelines for HIV-1 uninfected exposed breastfeeding infants. The preventive intervention includes: a) Point of care testing for early infant HIV diagnosis and maternal viral load; b) infant, single-drug Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) (lamivudine) if mothers are virally unsuppressed. The primary outcome is HIV-transmission rate from EPI-2 to 12 months. The study targets to screen 37,000 mother/infant pairs in Zambia and Burkina Faso to identify 2000 mother/infant pairs for the clinical trial. The study design and challenges faced during study implementation are described, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the amended HIV guidelines in Zambia in 2020 (triple-drug PrEP in HIV exposed infants guided by quarterly maternal viral load).

Several organisations have developed formal advice about testing for COVID-19 to assist in the control of the disease. We collated, delineated and appraised current worldwide recommendations about the role and applications of tests to control SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19. METHODS: We searched for documents providing recommendations for COVID-19 testing in PubMed, EMBASE, LILACS, the Coronavirus Open Access Project living evidence database and relevant websites such as TRIP database, ECRI Guidelines Trust, the GIN database, from inception to 21 September 2020. Two reviewers applied the eligibility criteria to potentially relevant citations without language or geographical restrictions. We extracted data in duplicate, including assessment of methodological quality using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II tool. RESULTS: We included 47 relevant documents and 327 recommendations about testing. Regarding the quality of the documents, we found that the domains with the lowest scores were 'Editorial independence' (Median=4%) and 'Applicability' (Median=6%). Only six documents obtained at least 50% score for the 'Rigour of development' domain. An important number of recommendations focused on the diagnosis of suspected cases (48%) and deisolation measures (11%). The most frequently recommended test was the reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assay (87 recommendations) and the chest CT (38 recommendations). There were 22 areas of agreement among guidance developers, including the use of RT-PCR for SARS-Cov-2 confirmation, the limited role of bronchoscopy, the use chest CT and chest X-rays for grading severity and the co-assessment for other respiratory pathogens. CONCLUSION: This first scoping review of recommendations for COVID-19 testing showed many limitations in the methodological quality of included guidance documents that could affect the confidence of clinicians in their implementation. Future guidance documents should incorporate a minimum set of key methodological characteristics to enhance their applicability for decision making.","Arevalo-Rodriguez, Ingrid; Seron, Pamela; Buitrago-García, Diana; Ciapponi, Agustin; Muriel, Alfonso; Zambrano-Achig, Paula; Del Campo, Rosa; Galán-Montemayor, Juan Carlos; Simancas-Racines, Daniel; Perez-Molina, Jose A; Khan, Khalid Saeed; Zamora, Javier",BMJ Open,,446

RESULTS: There were sharp declines in cases of all reportable bacterial STDs occurring in conjunction with the March 19, 2020 CA stay-at-home order, most of which did not return to baseline by July. Comparing January-June 2020 to January-June of 2019, there were decreases in reported cases of CT (31%), late latent syphilis (19%), primary/secondary syphilis (15%), early non-primary non-secondary syphilis (14%), and GC (13%). The largest percentage declines in STD case reporting were among Hispanic, Asian/Pacific Islander, and Black persons. Seventy-eight percent of LHJ respondents indicated that half or more of their workforce had been redeployed to COVID-19 by September 2020. CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 era, STD case reporting and programmatic functions have diminished throughout CA. As this may contribute to decreases or delays in STD diagnosis and treatment - with resultant increases in STD transmission - providers and public health officials should prepare for potential increases in STD-related morbidity in the months and years to come.","Johnson, Kelly A; Burghardt, Nicole O; Tang, Eric C; Long, Pike; Plotzker, Rosalyn; Gilson, Denise; Murphy, Ryan; Jacobson, Kathleen",Sex. transm. dis,,446
359931,Comparison of clinical features and outcomes in COVID-19 and influenza pneumonia patients requiring intensive care unit admission,2021,"BACKGROUND: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, mental health services have had to offer psychological therapy via video with little time to prepare or mitigate potential problems. Identifying the barriers, benefits and training needs highlighted by clinicians may support the effective delivery of care. METHOD: Changes in the mode therapy sessions were delivered in during 2020 were assessed in two high-volume psychological therapies services. Sixty-six therapists completed a survey about their experiences of delivering therapy via video. RESULTS: The lockdown in March 2020 precipitated a dramatic shift from face-to-face to telephone and video-delivered sessions. Most clinicians (89%) found video-based sessions acceptable. Barriers to effective delivery included technological issues, problems with online platforms, and feeling more tired after sessions. Benefits included generalised learning from behavioural work, improvements in efficiency and in the therapeutic relationship, particularly in comparison with telephone-based sessions. Tutorials and support guides were recommended to maximise use of sessions via video. CONCLUSIONS: Video-delivered therapy was liked by clinicians and preferred to telephone-based sessions. Issues with platforms, internet connections and access for patients need addressing, local troubleshooting guides, video-based tutorials and greater support for low-intensity therapists to maximise uptake of video sessions where appropriate, may be beneficial.","Buckman, Joshua E J; Saunders, Rob; Leibowitz, Judy; Minton, Rebecca",Behav Cogn Psychother,,446

METHODS: We examined characteristics and predictors of hospitalization and death in a nationwide cohort of all Danish individuals tested for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from 27 February 2020 until 19 May 2020. RESULTS: We identified 11 122 SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction-positive cases of whom 80% were community-managed and 20% were hospitalized. Thirty-day all-cause mortality was 5.2%. Age was strongly associated with fatal disease {odds ratio [OR] 15 [95% confidence interval (CI): 9-26] for 70-79 years, increasing to OR 90 (95% CI: 50-162) for &#8805;90 years, when compared with cases aged 50-59 years and adjusted for sex and number of co-morbidities}. Similarly, the number of co-morbidities was associated with fatal disease [OR 5.2 (95% CI: 3.4-8.0), for cases with at least four co-morbidities vs no co-morbidities] and 79% of fatal cases had at least two co-morbidities. Most major chronic diseases were associated with hospitalization, with ORs ranging from 1.3-1.4 (e.g. stroke, ischaemic heart disease) to 2.6-3.4 (e.g. heart failure, hospital-diagnosed kidney disease, organ transplantation) and with mortality with ORs ranging from 1.1-1.3 (e.g. ischaemic heart disease, hypertension) to 2.5-3.2 (e.g. major psychiatric disorder, organ transplantation). In the absence of co-morbidities, mortality was <5% in persons aged &#8804;80 years. CONCLUSIONS: In this nationwide population-based COVID-19 study, increasing age and multimorbidity were strongly associated with hospitalization and death. In the absence of co-morbidities, the mortality was, however, <5% until the age of 80 years.","Reilev, Mette; Kristensen, Kasper Bruun; Pottegård, Anton; Lund, Lars Christian; Hallas, Jesper; Ernst, Martin Thomsen; Christiansen, Christian Fynbo; Sørensen, Henrik Toft; Johansen, Nanna Borup; Brun, Nikolai Constantin; Voldstedlund, Marianne; Støvring, Henrik; Thomsen, Marianne Kragh; Christensen, Steffen; Gubbels, Sophie; Krause, Tyra Grove; Mølbak, Kåre; Thomsen, Reimar Wernich",Int J Epidemiol,,446

Results 81 patients were enrolled;44 patients had endoscopy (group A) while 37 patients received conservativemanagement (group B) based on clinical decision. There was no significant difference regarding age (Mean 64.6 yrs. for A, 67.4 yrs. for B), Charlson comorbidities index(Mean 4.59 for A, 4.36 for B), systolic blood pressure (Mean was 118 for A, 126 for B), heart rate Mean 94.7 for A and 88.5for B), Urea (Mean 10.8 for A and 10.6 for B) and Rockall pre endoscopy score (mean 3.77 for A and 3.43 for B). There was no significant difference in outcome regarding;length of hospital stay (mean 8.36 for A and 6.64 for B), rebleed(9.09 % for A and 8.10 % for B), ITU admission (2.27 % for A and 5.4 % for B) and 30-day mortality (13.63 % for A and18.91 % for B). Conclusions There was no significant difference regarding the outcome in conservative and endoscopic management forUGIB during this period. Higher GBS and lower Hb were associated with a higher rate of endoscopic management.

371092,Initial single center ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction experience in New York before and during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"The widespread adoption of emergency powers during Covid-19 raises important questions about what constitutes a (un)democratic response to crises. While the institutions and practices of democracy during normal times are well established, democratic standards during emergencies have yet to be conceptualized in the literature. This makes it difficult to systematically answer questions like - How do states' responses to Covid-19 violate democratic standards? Do such violations make states' responses more effective? Drawing on international treaties, norms, and academic scholarship, we propose a novel conceptualization of democratic standards for emergency measures. We then identify which government responses to Covid-19 qualify as a violation of democratic standards within the framework of illiberal and authoritarian practices, introducing a dataset covering 144 countries from March 2020 onward. In this article, we provide an overview of the extent to which states violated democratic standards in their response to Covid-19 during 2020. We find no relationship between violations of democratic standards and reported Covid-19 mortality. Illiberal and authoritarian practices in response to the Covid-19 pandemic do not correlate with better public health outcomes. Rather, such crisis-driven violations should be carefully observed as they could signal autocratization.","Edgell, Amanda B; Lachapelle, Jean; Lührmann, Anna; Maerz, Seraphine F",Soc Sci Med,,446

Children underwent enzyme-linked immunosorbent serological study for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies: VIRCELL IgG assay. RESULTS: One hundred thirteen children from 69 HCWs with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited: 47 children had positive IgG (41.6%). Children secondary attack rate was 43.7% (25% if both parents have had asymptomatic infection; 39.5% if one parent was symptomatic; and 47% when both parents had symptoms). Having a positive sibling was associated with a positive IgG result (odds ratio = 12.2; 95% confidence interval: 4.4-33.7, P < 0.001). Median age was higher in IgG positive children (P = 0.022).

Methods: We employed a longitudinal design. We recruited participants for an online panel survey from chat groups on social media platforms. There were 5 waves of interviews. Information on uncertainty stress and related variables were collected via the online survey. Descriptive statistics and the GIM program were used for data analysis. Results: Participants numbered 150 for the linkable baseline survey and 102 (68%) for the final survey. Uncertainty stress (ß = -.047, SE = .118, p > .05) did not show a statistically significant temporal change trend over the observation period. Disease fear manifested a statistically significant downwards trend (ß = -.342, SE = .157, p < .05), and prevention behaviors indicated an upwards trend (ß = .048, SE = .021, p < .05) during the observation period. Uncertainty stress was positively associated with disease fear (ß = .45046, SE = .05964, p < .001), and negatively associated with self-efficacy (ß = -.6698, SE = .01035, p < .001), and prevention behaviors (ß = -.02029, SE = .00876, p =.021).

383574,Systemic Involvement of Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19): A Review of Literature,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic has stimulated considerable interest in the resilience of the U.S. food system. Less attention has been paid to the resiliency characteristics of the final link in the food system – individual households. We use national survey data from July 2020 to understand the food acquisition, preparation, and management strategies that households implemented in response to the pandemic. We find a substantial increase in the amount of food prepared and consumed at home which scales with respondents’ time availability, perceived risks of dining out, and pandemic-induced income disruption. We then identify several household responses to support this increase in home food consumption that are in line with practices suggested to enhance resiliency at other links in the food supply chain, including increased cold storage capacity and enhanced in-house capability via improved cooking and food management skills. We discuss how responses such as improved food skills can reduce the propagation of shocks through the supply chain by allowing greater flexibility and less waste, while actions such as increased home cold storage capacity could undermine system resilience by exacerbating bullwhip effects, i.e., amplifying consumer demand shocks that are propagated to upstream food supply chain actors.","Bender, Kathryn E.; Badiger, Aishwarya Roe Brian E.; Shu, Yiheng Qi Danyi",Socio-Economic Planning Sciences,,446

385635,Characteristics and Risk Factors Associated with Critical Illness in Pediatric Covid-19,2021,"The spread of SARS-CoV-2, along with the lack of targeted medicaments, encouraged research of existing drugs for repurposing. The rapid response to SARS-CoV-2 infection comprises a complex interaction of cytokine storm, endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, and pathologic coagulation. Thus, active molecules targeting multiple steps in SARS-CoV-2 lifecycle are highly wanted. Herein we explored the in silico capability of silibinin from Silybum marianum to interact with the SARS-CoV-2 main target proteins, and the in vitro effects against cytokine-induced-inflammation and dysfunction in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Computational analysis revealed that silibinin forms a stable complex with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein RBD, has good negative binding affinity with Mpro, and interacts with many residues on the active site of Mpro, thus supporting its potentiality in inhibiting viral entry and replication. Moreover, HUVECs pretreatment with silibinin reduced TNF-&#945;-induced gene expression of the proinflammatory genes IL-6 and MCP-1, as well as of PAI-1, a critical factor in coagulopathy and thrombosis, and of ET-1, a peptide involved in hemostatic vasoconstriction. Then, due to endothelium antiinflammatory and anticoagulant properties of silibinin and its capability to interact with SARS-CoV-2 main target proteins demonstrated herein, silibinin could be a strong candidate for COVID-19 management from a multitarget perspective.","Speciale, Antonio; Muscarà, Claudia; Molonia, Maria Sofia; Cimino, Francesco; Saija, Antonella; Giofrè, Salvatore Vincenzo",Phytother. res,,446

Emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants emphasizes the notion that antibody treatments need to rely on highly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), targeting several distinct epitopes for circumventing therapy escape-mutants. Previously, we reported efficient human therapeutic mAbs recognizing epitopes on the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2. Here we report the isolation, characterization and recombinant production of 12 neutralizing human mAbs, targeting three distinct epitopes on the spike N-terminal domain (NTD) of the virus. Neutralization mechanism of these antibodies involves receptors other than the canonical hACE2 on target cells, relying both on amino-acid and N-glycan epitope-recognition, suggesting alternative viral cellular-portals. Two selected mAbs demonstrated full protection of K18-hACE2 transgenic mice when administered at low doses and late post-exposure, demonstrating the high potential of the mAbs for therapy of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Noy-Porat, Tal; Mechaly, Adva; Levy, Yinon; Makdasi, Efi; Alcalay, Ron; Gur, David; Aftalion, Moshe; Falach, Reut; Ben-Arye, Shani Leviatan; Lazar, Shirley; Zauberman, Ayelet; Epstein, Eyal; Chitlaru, Theodor; Weiss, Shay; Achdout, Hagit; Edgeworth, Jonathan D; Kikkeri, Raghavendra; Yu, Hai; Chen, Xi; Yitzhaki, Shmuel; Shapira, Shmuel C; Padler-Karavani, Vered; Mazor, Ohad; Rosenfeld, Ronit",iScience,,446
389966,Smart secretion management to protect nurses from COVID19 and other infectious diseases,2021,"The dynamics, such as transmission, spatial epidemiology, and clinical course of Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) have emerged as the most intriguing features and remain incompletely understood. The genetic landscape of an individual in particular, and a population in general seems to play a pivotal role in shaping the above COVID-19 dynamics. Considering the implications of host genes in the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2 and in mounting the host immune response, it appears that multiple genes might be crucially involved in the above processes. Herein, we propose three potentially important genetic gateways to COVID-19 infection; these could explain at least in part the discrepancies of its spread, severity, and mortality. The variations within Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene might constitute the first genetic gateway, influencing the spatial transmission dynamics of COVID-19. The Human Leukocyte Antigen locus, a master regulator of immunity against infection seems to be crucial in influencing susceptibility and severity of COVID-19 and can be the second genetic gateway. The genes regulating Toll-like receptor and complement pathways and subsequently cytokine storm induced exaggerated inflammatory pathways seem to underlie the severity of COVID-19, and such genes might represent the third genetic gateway. Host-pathogen interaction is a complex event and some additional genes might also contribute to the dynamics of COVID-19. Overall, these three genetic gateways proposed here might be the critical host determinants governing the risk, severity, and outcome of COVID-19. Genetic variations within these gateways could be key in influencing geographical discrepancies of COVID-19.","Debnath, Monojit; Banerjee, Moinak; Berk, Michael",FASEB J,,446
389967,Smart secretion management to protect nurses from COVID19 and other infectious diseases,2021,"Since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak started, children have been considered marginally involved compared to adults, with a quite significant percentage of asymptomatic carriers. Very recently, an overwhelming inflammatory activation, which shares clinical similarities with Kawasaki disease (KD), has been described in children exposed to COVID-19. We report three KD-like cases that occurred during the pandemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a highly affected area of Northern Italy. The clinical presentation was characterized by the presence of unremitting fever, diarrhea and elevated inflammatory markers. Case #1 and Case #2 occurred one week apart and shared other clinical features: laboratory tests confirmed COVID-19 exposure and high inflammatory activation with myocardial involvement. Case #3 followed a more typical pattern for KD. Interestingly, this patient showed lower levels of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, D-dimers, and ferritin compared to the other two cases, whereas platelet count was higher. We hypothesize that SARS-CoV-2 might act in children as a trigger, either inducing a classical KD phenotype or causing a systemic inflammatory response leading to a severe KD-like phenotype, eventually characterized by myocardial impairment. We think that bringing these cases and their differences to the attention of the rheumatology community during the COVID-19 pandemic will be beneficial in order to highlight the importance of early diagnosis and to increase awareness of this new phenomenon.","Marino, A; Varisco, T; Quattrocchi, G; Amoroso, A; Beltrami, D; Venturiello, S; Ripamonti, A; Villa, A; Andreotti, M; Ciuffreda, M; Cimaz, R",Reumatismo,,446

391902,Blood type A associated with critical COVID-19 and death in a Swedish cohort-a critical comment,2020,"BACKGROUND: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease that produces synovial membrane inflammation and causes progressive articular damage with function lossing. There is some controversy about whether RA is associated with infection and complications after spinal surgery. This study aims to determine the effect of RA on spinal surgery infection and complications. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. All studies that compared patients who underwent spinal operation with and without RA were included in the analysis. RESULTS: There were statistically significant higher rates of complications (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.20-1.70, p < 0.05) and infections (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.46-1.95, p <0.05) in RA than in non-RA patients undergoing spinal surgery. When registry data were excluded, the study suggested that complications and infections were still higher in the patients with RA than in the non-RA patient groups, (OR 2.24, 95% CI 0.92-5.44, p = 0.08) and (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.50-2.07,p < 0.05) respectively. CONCLUSION: When undergoing spinal surgery, patients with RA are at higher risks of operative complications and infection. Surgeons should be aware of these risks and appropriately plan spinal operation for patients with RA, in order to reduce the risks of complications.","Zhang, Shuangjiang; Wang, Lili; Bao, Li; Sun, Haibo; Feng, Fei; Shan, Jianlin; Tang, Hai",World neurosurgery (Online),,446

The SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Moroccan patients revealed 62 mutations, of which 30 were mis-sense mutations. The mutations Spike_D614G and NSP12_P323L were present in all the 22 analyzed sequences, followed by N_G204R and N_R203K, which occurred in 9 among the 22 sequences. The mutations NSP10_R134S, NSP15_D335N, NSP16_I169L, NSP3_L431H, NSP3_P1292L and Spike_V6F occurred once in Moroccan sequences, with no record in other sequences worldwide. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that Moroccan SARS-CoV-2 genomes included 9 viruses belonging to clade 20A, 9 to clade 20B and 2 to clade 20C, suggesting that the epidemic spread in Morocco did not display a predominant SARS-CoV-2 route. Therefore, multiple and unrelated introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Morocco through different routes have occurred, giving rise to the diversity of virus genomes in the country. Further, in all probability, the SARS-CoV-2 circulated in a cryptic way in Morocco, starting from January 15, 2020 before the first case was officially discovered on March 2, 2020.","Badaoui, Bouabid; Sadki, Khalid; Talbi, Chouhra; Salah, Driss; Tazi, Lina",,,446

However, their drug release processes were usually discussed in the absence of proteins, which are abundant in real delivery media and likely to affect the release behaviors. In this work, novel pH-sensitive silica-based DDSs were constructed using the endogenous protein, human serum albumin (HSA), as the gatekeeper, and their release properties in protein-containing media were measured for the first time. As-synthesized mesoporous silica nanorod (MSNR) was modified with zwitterions to suppress the nonspecific adsorption of protein and to improve the dispersity. HSA was fixed onto MSNR through drug-protein interactions and covalent bonds, respectively. Benzoic-imine bonds were introduced into the designs to realize pH responsiveness. The fluorescence quenching effect of drugs on HSA was used to monitor the drug release in simulated body fluids containing proteins. The results indicated that protein gating could effectively reduce premature release in normal blood environment. The endogenous protein capping, high dispersity and stability, considerable loading content, low cytotoxicity and favorable responsiveness to acidic microenvironment enable the present structures to be promising carriers for chemotherapy drugs.","Zhang, Huaxin; Xia, Qinghua; Zhou, Dan",Colloids Surf B Biointerfaces,,446

Numerical models that consider the cortical tables and the diploë as domains with separate isotropic material properties are constructed for each bone segment using a routine that identifies the cortical table-diploë boundaries from micro-computed tomography scan images, and reconstructs a three-dimensional geometry layer by layer. The material properties for cortical tables and diploë are obtained using a Hounsfield Unit-based mass density calculation combined with a parameter identification scheme for Young's modulus estimation. With the identified parameters, the average error between experimental and numerical modal frequencies is 1.3% and the modal assurance criterion values for most modes are above 0.90, indicating that the layered model is suitable for predicting the vibrational behavior of cranial bone. The proposed layered modeling and identified elastic parameters are also useful to support computational modeling of cranial guided waves and mode conversion in medical ultrasound. Additionally, the diploë elastic properties are rarely reported in the literature, making this work a fundamental characterization effort that can guide in the selection of material properties for human head models that consider layered cranial bone.","Kohtanen, E; Mazzotti, M; Ruzzene, M; Erturk, A",J Mech Behav Biomed Mater,,446

Under controlled conditions, aerosol particles can travel up to a distance of 28 feet (or 8 m); however, such aerosol particles are less likely to have sufficient quantities of viable viruses to spread infection. Additionally, nearly all the experimental models examined the behavior of the aerosols only in confined spaces, not in open areas; these findings, therefore, cannot be considered generally applicable. In the absence of scientific information and education, only misconceptions, unfounded fears, and unsubstantiated myths will prevail. Given that an effective vaccine and drugs are still not available, prevention remains the only option of protection against SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus.

403501,Impact of a Ketogenic Diet on Metabolic Parameters in Patients with Obesity or Overweight and with or without Type 2 Diabetes: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials,2020,"AIMS: The primary aim was to determine the influence of COVID-19 on 30-day mortality following hip fracture. Secondary aims were to determine predictors of COVID-19 status on presentation and later in the admission; the rate of hospital acquired COVID-19; and the predictive value of negative swabs on admission. METHODS: A nationwide multicentre retrospective cohort study was conducted of all patients presenting with a hip fracture to 17 Scottish centres in March and April 2020. Demographics, presentation blood tests, COVID-19 status, Nottingham Hip Fracture Score, management, length of stay, and 30-day mortality were recorded. RESULTS: In all, 78/833 (9.4%) patients were diagnosed with COVID-19. The 30-day survival of patients with COVID-19 was significantly lower than for those without (65.4% vs 91%; p < 0.001). Diagnosis of COVID-19 within seven days of admission (likely community acquired) was independently associated with male sex (odds ratio (OR) 2.34, p = 0.040, confidence interval (CI) 1.04 to 5.25) and symptoms of COVID-19 (OR 15.56, CI 6.61 to 36.60, p < 0.001). Diagnosis of COVID-19 made between seven and 30 days of admission to hospital (likely hospital acquired) was independently associated with male sex (OR 1.73, CI 1.05 to 2.87, p = 0.032), Nottingham Hip Fracture Score &#8805; 7 (OR 1.91, CI 1.09 to 3.34, p = 0.024), pulmonary disease (OR 1.68, CI 1.00 to 2.81, p = 0.049), American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade &#8805; 3 (OR 2.37, CI 1.13 to 4.97, p = 0.022), and length of stay &#8805; nine days (OR 1.98, CI 1.18 to 3.31, p = 0.009). A total of 38 (58.5%) COVID-19 cases were probably hospital acquired infections. The false-negative rate of a negative swab on admission was 0% in asymptomatic patients and 2.9% in symptomatic patients. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 was independently associated with a three times increased 30-day mortality rate. Nosocomial transmission may have accounted for approximately half of all cases during the first wave of the pandemic. Identification of risk factors for having COVID-19 on admission or acquiring COVID-19 in hospital may guide pathways for isolating or shielding patients respectively. Length of stay was the only modifiable risk factor, which emphasizes the importance of high-quality and timely care in this patient group.

A 28-year-old male and a 32-year-old female, found to be positive in rRT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2, had a loss of taste and smell, respectively. Following the regaining of their ability to smell after 87 and 72 days, respectively, the male patient reported that the smell he perceived felt the smell of burnt rubber, while the female patient stated that it was similar to the smell of onion. As a result of evaluations, a diagnosis of delayed parosmia was made occurring in the late period secondary to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although anosmia is a common symptom in the early phase of COVID-19, olfactory damage due to Sars-CoV-2 can be persistent, and distorted sense of smell can be prolonged.","Duyan, Murat; Ozturan, Ibrahim Ulas; Altas, Murat",SN Compr Clin Med,,446
405220,Outcomes of patients with COVID-19-associated ards treated with hfnc vs. conventional oxygen therapy,2021,"People with coronavirus disease (COVID-19) might have several risk factors for delirium, which could in turn notably worsen the prognosis. Although pharmacological approaches for delirium are debated, haloperidol and other first-generation antipsychotics are frequently employed, particularly for hyperactive presentations. However, the use of these conventional treatments could be limited in people with COVID-19, due to the underlying medical condition and the risk of drug–drug interactions with anti-COVID treatments. On these premises, we carried out a rapid review in order to identify possible alternative medications for this particular population. By searching PubMed and the Cochrane Library, we selected the most updated systematic reviews of randomised trials on the pharmacological treatment of delirium in both intensive and non-intensive care settings, and on the treatment of agitation related to acute psychosis or dementia. We identified medications performing significantly better than placebo or haloperidol as the reference treatment in each population considered, and assessed the strength of association according to validated criteria. In addition, we collected data on other relevant clinical elements (i.e. common adverse events, drug-drug interactions with COVID-19 medications, daily doses) and regulatory elements (i.e. therapeutic indications, contra-indications, available formulations). A total of 10 systematic reviews were included. Overall, relatively few medications showed benefits over placebo in the four selected populations. As compared with placebo, significant benefits emerged for quetiapine and dexmedetomidine in intensive care unit (ICU) settings, and for none of the medications in non-ICU settings. Considering also data from indirect populations (agitation related to acute psychosis or dementia), aripiprazole, quetiapine and risperidone showed a potential benefit in two or three different populations. Despite limitations related to the rapid review methodology and the use of data from indirect populations, the evidence retrieved can pragmatically support treatment choices of frontline practitioners involved in the COVID-19 outbreak, and indicate future research directions for the treatment of delirium in particularly vulnerable populations.","Ostuzzi, Giovanni; Gastaldon, Chiara; Papola, Davide; Fagiolini, Andrea; Dursun, Serdar; Taylor, David; Correll, Christoph U.; Barbui, Corrado",Ther.

We propose a new measure of node's centrality, which is no longer a scalar value, but a vector with dimension one lower than the highest order of interaction in the graph. Such a vectorial measure is linked to the eigenvector centrality for networks containing only pairwise interactions, whereas it has a significant added value in all other situations where interactions occur at higher-orders. In particular, it is able to unveil different roles which may be played by a same node at different orders of interactions, an information which is impossible to be retrieved by single scalar measures.","Kovalenko, Kirill; Romance, Miguel; Aleja, David; Vasilyeva, Ekaterina; Criado, Regino; Raigorodskii, Andrei M; Flores, Julio; Alfaro-Bittner, Karin; Perc, Matjaz; Boccaletti, Stefano",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.13846v1.pdf,446

Angiotensin I Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2), the principal receptor of SARS-CoV2, has been found to be communicated with Dopa decarboxylase in unwinding the connection of catecholamines with COVID-19 infection. Cardiovascular (CV) sickness, diabetes, hypertension, and related conditions cause significant risks during the current situation and the affected people are under basic observation around the world. The hypertension and diabetes are related with alterations in the degrees of catecholamines associated with renal gland. The naive form of renal dopaminergic framework is related with the expanded reabsorption of sodium resulting in downregulation of the ACE2 expression. Catecholamine biosynthesis is managed by counter-controlling angiotensin type 1R (AT1R) and angiotensin type 2R (AT2R), incitement of AT2 lessens catecholamine biosynthesis by means of a diminishing in cGMP levels likewise incitement of AT1 initiate catecholamine biosynthesis.

407743,Could the severity of COVID-19 be increased by low gastric acidity?,2020,"Facing the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan demonstrated resilience at the initial stage of epidemic prevention, and effectively slowed down its spread. This study aims to document public epidemic awareness of COVID-19 in Taiwan through collecting social media- and Internet-based data, and provide valuable experience of Taiwan's response to COVID-19, involving citizens, news media, and the government, to aid the public in overcoming COVID-19, or infectious diseases that may emerge in the future. The volume of Google searches related to COVID-19 and face masks was regarded as an indicator of public epidemic awareness in the study. A time-series analysis was used to explore the relationships among public epidemic awareness and other COVID-19 relevant variables, which were collected based on big data analysis. Additionally, the content analysis was adopted to analyze the transmission of different types of fear information related to COVID-19 and their effects on the public. Our results indicate that public epidemic awareness was significantly correlated with the number of confirmed cases in Taiwan and the number of news reports on COVID-19 (correlation coefficient: .33-.56). Additionally, the findings from the content analysis suggested that the fear of the loss of control best explains why panic behavior occurs among the public. When confronting the highly infectious COVID-19, public epidemic awareness is vital. While fear is an inevitable result when an emerging infectious disease occurs, the government can convert resistance into assistance by understanding why fear arises and which fear factors cause excessive public panic. Moreover, in the digitalization era, online and social media activities could reflect public epidemic awareness that can e harnessed for epidemic control.","Chin, Chih-Yu; Liu, Chang-Pan; Wang, Cheng-Lung",PLoS One,,446

The purpose of this review is to offer healthcare providers with examples of how to respond to patient questions about masks in a way that encourages responsible decision-making. We conclude, based on the evidence showing a benefit for cloth masks and the recent reports supporting a role for aerosols in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2, that cloth masks will be effective when used correctly. We further assert that stronger public messaging surrounding cloth masks in the community setting is needed, and should specify that 2-3 layer, fitted face masks be worn at all times in public as another layer of protection in addition to social distancing, not just when social distancing cannot be maintained.","Martinez, Jessica A; Miller, Rachel H; Martinez, Ryan A",J. gen. intern. med,,446

411327,Responsiveness of Inhaled Epoprostenol in Respiratory Failure due to COVID-19,2020,"How to make unsupervised language pre-training more efficient and less resource-intensive is an important research direction in NLP. In this paper, we focus on improving the efficiency of language pre-training methods through providing better data utilization. It is well-known that in language data corpus, words follow a heavy-tail distribution. A large proportion of words appear only very few times and the embeddings of rare words are usually poorly optimized. We argue that such embeddings carry inadequate semantic signals. They could make the data utilization inefficient and slow down the pre-training of the entire model. To solve this problem, we propose Taking Notes on the Fly (TNF). TNF takes notes for rare words on the fly during pre-training to help the model understand them when they occur next time. Specifically, TNF maintains a note dictionary and saves a rare word's context information in it as notes when the rare word occurs in a sentence. When the same rare word occurs again in training, TNF employs the note information saved beforehand to enhance the semantics of the current sentence. By doing so, TNF provides a better data utilization since cross-sentence information is employed to cover the inadequate semantics caused by rare words in the sentences. Experimental results show that TNF significantly expedite the BERT pre-training and improve the model's performance on downstream tasks. TNF's training time is $60\%$ less than BERT when reaching the same performance. When trained with same number of iterations, TNF significantly outperforms BERT on most of downstream tasks and the average GLUE score.","Wu, Qiyu; Xing, Chen; Li, Yatao; Ke, Guolin; He, Di; Liu, Tie-Yan",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.01466v1.pdf,446

414467,Double Mechanical Heart Valves in Pregnant Woman: Real World Directed Therapy during Covid-19 Era,2021,"KEY POINTS: The impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on autonomic and cardiovascular function in otherwise healthy individuals is unknown. We show for the first time that young adults recovering from SARS-CoV-2 have elevated resting sympathetic activity, but similar heart rate and blood pressure, compared with control subjects. Survivors of SARS-CoV-2 also exhibit suppressed sympathetic nerve activity and pain perception during a cold pressor test compared with healthy controls. Further, these individuals display higher sympathetic nerve activity throughout an orthostatic challenge, as well as an exaggerated heart rate response to orthostasis. If similar autonomic dysregulation, like that found here in young individuals, is present in older adults following SARS-CoV-2 infection, there may be substantial adverse implications for cardiovascular health. ABSTRACT: The novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can elicit systemic adverse physiologic effects. However, the impact of SARS-CoV-2 on autonomic and cardiovascular function in otherwise healthy individuals remains unclear. Young adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (COV+; n = 16, 8F) visited the laboratory 35±16 days following diagnosis. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure, and heart rate (HR) were measured in subjects at rest and during a 2-min cold pressor test (CPT) and 5 min each at 30° and 60° head-up tilt (HUT). Data were compared with age-matched healthy controls (CON; n = 14, 9F). COV+ participants (18.2±6.6 bursts·min-1 ) had higher resting MSNA burst frequency compared with CON (12.7±3.4 bursts·min-1 ) (p = 0.020), as well as higher MSNA burst incidence and total activity. Resting HR, SBP, and DBP were not different. During CPT, the change in total MSNA from baseline to peak was +71 a.u.âmin-1 in COV+ and +545 a.u.âmin-1 in CON (p = 0.008); there were no differences in HR, SBP, or DBP. COV+ subjects reported less pain during the CPT compared with CON (5.7±1.8 vs. 7.2±1.9 a.u., p = 0.036). MSNA was higher in COV+ compared with CON during HUT. There was a group-by-position interaction in MSNA burst incidence, as well as HR, in response to HUT. These results indicate resting sympathetic activity, but not HR or BP, may be elevated following SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further, cardiovascular and perceptual responses to physiological stress may be altered - including both exaggerated (orthostasis) and suppressed (pain) responses compared with healthy young adults.

Sixty million confirmed cases have been reported worldwide until November 29, 2020. Unfortunately, the novel coronavirus is extremely contagious and the mortality rate of severe and critically ill patients is high. Thus, there is no definite and effective treatment in clinical practice except for antiviral therapy and supportive therapy. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are not only characterized by low immunogenicity and homing but also have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulation characteristics. Furthermore, they can inhibit the occurrence and development of a cytokine storm, inhibit lung injury, and exert antipulmonary fibrosis and antioxidative stress, therefore MSC therapy is expected to become one of the effective therapies to treat severe COVID-19.

Main Outcomes and Measures: Participants underwent T2R38 phenotype taste testing to determine whether they were supertasters (those who experienced greater intensity of bitter tastes), tasters, or nontasters (those who experienced low intensity of bitter tastes or no bitter tastes) and underwent evaluation for lack of infection with SARS-CoV-2 via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing and IgM and IgG testing. A group of participants was randomly selected for genotype analysis to correlate phenotype. Participants were followed up until confirmation of infection with SARS-CoV-2 via PCR testing. Phenotype of T2R38 was retested after infection with SARS-CoV-2. The results were compared with clinical course. Results: A total of 1935 individuals (1101 women [56.9%]; mean [SD] age, 45.5 [13.9] years) participated in the study. Results of phenotype taste testing showed that 508 (26.3%) were supertasters, 917 (47.4%) were tasters, and 510 (26.4%) were nontasters. A total of 266 participants (13.7%) had positive PCR test results for SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 55 (20.7%) required hospitalization. Symptom duration among patients with positive results ranged from 0 to 48 days. Nontasters were significantly more likely than tasters and supertasters to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 (odds ratio, 10.1 [95% CI, 5.8-17.8]; P < .001), to be hospitalized once infected (odds ratio, 3.9 [1.5-10.2]; P = .006), and to be symptomatic for a longer duration (mean [SE] duration, 23.7 [0.5] days vs 13.5 [0.4] days vs 5.0 [0.6] days; P < .001). A total of 47 of 55 patients (85.5%) with COVID-19 who required inpatient admission were nontasters. Conversely, 15 of 266 patients (5.6%) with positive PCR test results were supertasters. Conclusions and Relevance: This cohort study suggests that T2R38 receptor allelic variants were associated with participants' innate immune response toward SARS-CoV-2. The T2R phenotype was associated with patients' clinical course after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nontasters were more likely to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 than the other 2 groups, suggesting enhanced innate immune protection against SARS-CoV-2.","Barham, Henry P; Taha, Mohamed A; Broyles, Stephanie T; Stevenson, Megan M; Zito, Brittany A; Hall, Christian A",JAMA Netw Open,,446
417637,19 Factors Associated with County-Level SARS-CoV-2 Testing Volume in Nine States,2020,"This study presents a general model predictive control (MPC) algorithm for optimizing wastewater aeration in Water Resource Recovery Facilities (WRRF) under different management objectives. The flexibility of the MPC is demonstrated by controlling a WRRF under four management objectives, aiming at minimizing: (A) effluent concentrations, (B) electricity consumption, (C) total operations costs (sum electricity costs and discharge effluent tax) or (D) global warming potential (direct and indirect nitrous oxide emissions, and indirect from electricity production) . The MPC is tested with data from the alternating WRRF in Nørre Snede (Denmark) and from the Danish electricity grid. Results showed how the four control objectives resulted in important differences in aeration patterns and in the concentration dynamics over a day. Controls B and C showed similarities when looking at total costs, while similarities in global warming potential for controls A and D suggest that improving effluent quality also reduced greenhouse gasses emissions. The MPC flexibility in handling different objectives is shown by using a combined objective function, optimizing both cost and greenhouse emissions. This shows the trade-off between the two objectives, enabling the calculation of marginal costs and thus allowing WRRF operators to carefully evaluate prioritization of management objectives. The long-term MPC performance is evaluated over 51 days covering seasonal and inter-weekly variations. On a daily basis, control A was 9-30% cheaper on average compared to controls A, D and to the current rule-based control. Similarly, control D resulted on average in 35-43% lower greenhouse gasses daily emission compared to the other controls. Difference between control performance increased for days with greater inter-diurnal variations in electricity price or greenhouse emissions from electricity production, i.e. when MPC has greater possibilities for exploiting input variations. The flexibility of the proposed MPC can easily accommodate for additional control objectives, allowing WRRF operators to quickly adapt the plant operation to new management objectives and to face new performance requirements.","Stentoft, P A; Munk-Nielsen, T; Møller, J K; Madsen, H; Valverde-Pérez, B; Mikkelsen, P S; Vezzaro, L",Water Res,,446

To examine the quality of such data, we chose to replicate lexical decision and item recognition paradigms from Ratcliff et al. (Cognitive Psychology, 60, 127-157, 2010) and numerosity discrimination paradigms from Ratcliff and McKoon (Psychological Review, 125, 183-217, 2018) with subjects recruited from Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). Along with these tasks, we collected data from either an IQ test or a math computation test. Subjects in the lexical decision and item recognition tasks were relatively well-behaved, with only a few giving a significant number of responses with response times (RTs) under 300 ms at chance accuracy, i.e., fast guesses, and a few with unstable RTs across a session. But in the numerosity discrimination tasks, almost half of the subjects gave a significant number of fast guesses and/or unstable RTs across the session. Diffusion model parameters were largely consistent with the earlier studies as were correlations across tasks and correlations with IQ and age. One surprising result was that eliminating fast outliers from subjects with highly variable RTs (those eliminated from the main analyses) produced diffusion model analyses that showed patterns of correlations similar to the subjects with stable performance. Methods for displaying data to examine stability, eliminating subjects, and implementing RT data collection on AMT including checks on timing are also discussed.","Ratcliff, Roger; Hendrickson, Andrew T",Behav. res. meth,,446

423739,Evaluating the efficacy and safety of the existing repurposed pharmacological agents for treating covid-19: A meta-analysis and systemic review of clinical trials,2020,"SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread from a regional outbreak to a global pandemic in just a few months. Global research efforts have focused on developing effective vaccines against COVID-19. However, some of the basic epidemiological parameters, such as the exponential epidemic growth rate and the basic reproductive number, R0, across geographic areas are still not well quantified. Here, we developed and fit a mathematical model to case and death count data collected from the United States and eight European countries during the early epidemic period before broad control measures were implemented. Results show that the early epidemic grew exponentially at rates between 0.18 and 0.29/day (epidemic doubling times between 2.4 and 3.9 days). We found that for such rapid epidemic growth, high levels of intervention efforts are necessary, no matter the goal is mitigation or containment. We discuss the current estimates of the mean serial interval, and argue that existing evidence suggests that the interval is between 6 and 8 days in the absence of active isolation efforts. Using parameters consistent with this range, we estimated the median R0 value to be 5.8 (confidence interval: 4.7-7.3) in the United States and between 3.6 and 6.1 in the eight European countries. We further analyze how vaccination schedules depend on R0, the duration of protective immunity to SARS-CoV-2, and show that individual-level heterogeneity in vaccine induced immunity can significantly affect vaccination schedules.","Ke, Ruian; Romero-Severson, Ethan; Sanche, Steven; Hengartner, Nick",J Theor Biol,,446

Prioritizing containment efforts, protective personal equipment and testing can be challenging. Our aim was to develop a tool to identify patients with higher probability of COVID-19 diagnosis at admission. METHODS: This cross-sectional study analyzed data from 100 patients admitted with suspected COVID-19. Predictive models of COVID-19 diagnosis were performed based on radiology, clinical and laboratory findings; bootstrapping was performed in order to account for overfitting. RESULTS: A total of 29% of patients tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Variables associated with COVID-19 diagnosis in multivariate analysis were leukocyte count &#8804;7.7×103mm-3, LDH >273U/L, and chest radiographic abnormality. A predictive score was built for COVID-19 diagnosis, with an area under ROC curve of 0.847 (95% CI 0.77-0.92), 96% sensitivity and 73.5% specificity. After bootstrapping, the corrected AUC for this model was 0.827 (95% CI 0.75-0.90). CONCLUSIONS: Considering unavailability of RT-PCR at some centers, as well as its questionable early sensitivity, other tools might be used in order to identify patients who should be prioritized for testing, re-testing and admission to isolated wards. We propose a predictive score that can be easily applied in clinical practice. This score is yet to be validated in larger populations.","Vieceli, Tarsila; Oliveira Filho, Cilomar Martins de; Berger, Mariana; Saadi, Marina Petersen; Salvador, Pedro Antonio; Anizelli, Leonardo Bressan; Crivelaro, Pedro Castilhos de Freitas; Butzke, Mauricio; Zappelini, Roberta de Souza; Seligman, Beatriz Graeff Dos Santos; Seligman, Renato",Braz J Infect Dis,,446

This paper presents an analysis of the extent to which the economic shocks of mandatory closures to mitigate the pandemic ripple through the world economy. We utilize a state-of-the-art computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to analyze these interconnections through international trade. We compare estimates of the impacts on US GDP in isolation and then examine the impacts taking into account US trade with China and the rest of the world (ROW). Our analysis indicates that these international trade linkage impacts are generally negative and range from near zero to very large overall, depending on the region, and that own- and cross-country impacts differ by region as well. At the same time, we find that China is able to capitalize on the situation by actually being able to increase its exports through international trade following mandatory closures in other regions. We also confirm that the US economy was relatively insulated from trade linkages with the rest of the world. Sectoral impacts provide further insight into the results.","Rose, Adam; Walmsley, Terrie; Wei, Dan",Lett Spat Resour Sci,,446

We developed a triage strategy including noninvasive respiratory support and admission to the intermediate care unit (IMCU). ICU admission was restricted to patients requiring invasive ventilation. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study is to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients admitted to the IMCU. METHOD: Retrospective cohort including consecutive patients admitted between March 28 and April 27, 2020. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure avoiding ICU admission. Secondary outcomes included the rate of emergency intubation, 28-day mortality, and predictors of ICU admission. RESULTS: One hundred fifty-seven patients with COVID-19-associated pneumonia were admitted to the IMCU. Among the 85 patients admitted for worsening respiratory failure, 52/85 (61%) avoided ICU admission. In multivariate analysis, PaO2/FiO2 (OR 0.98; 95% CI: 0.96-0.99) and BMI (OR 0.88; 95% CI: 0.78-0.98) were significantly associated with ICU admission. No death or emergency intubation occurred in the IMCU. CONCLUSIONS: IMCU admission including standardized triage criteria, self-proning, and noninvasive respiratory support prevents ICU admission for a large proportion of patients with COVID-19 hypoxemic respiratory failure. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, IMCUs may play an important role in preserving ICU capacity by avoiding ICU admission for patients with worsening respiratory failure and allowing early discharge of ICU patients.","Grosgurin, Olivier; Leidi, Antonio; Farhoumand, Pauline Darbellay; Carballo, Sebastian; Adler, Dan; Reny, Jean-Luc; Bollen Pinto, Bernardo; Rossel, Anne; Serratrice, Jacques; Agoritsas, Thomas; Stirnemann, Jérôme; Marti, Christophe",Respiration,,446

While battling for the disease in China, six Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) recipes have been shown to be remarkably effective for treating patients with COVID-19. The present review discusses principles of TCM in curing infectious disease, and clinical evidence and mechanisms of the 6 most effective TCM recipes used in treating COVID-19 in 92% of all of the confirmed cases in China. Applications of TCM and specific recipes in the treatment of other viral infections, such as those caused by SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, influenza A virus (including H1N1 and H7N9), influenza B, dengue virus as well as Ebola virus, are also discussed. Among the 6 TCM recipes, Jinhua Qinggan (JHQG) granules and Lianhua Qingwen (LHQW) capsules are recommended during medical observation; Lung Cleansing and Detoxifying Decoction (LCDD) is recommended for the treatment of both severe and non-severe patients; Xuanfeibaidu (XFBD) granules are recommended for treating moderate cases; while Huashibaidu (HSBD) and Xuebijing (XBJ) have been used in managing severe cases effectively. The common components and the active ingredients of the six TCM recipes have been summarized to reveal most promising drug candidates. The potential molecular mechanisms of the active ingredients in the six TCM recipes that target ACE2, 3CLpro and IL-6, revealed by molecular biological studies and/or network pharmacology prediction/molecular docking analysis/visualization analysis, are fully discussed. Therefore, further investigation of these TCM recipes may be of high translational value in enabling novel targeted therapies for COVID-19, potentially via purification and characterization of the active ingredients in the effective TCM recipes.","Huang, Kai; Zhang, Pan; Zhang, Zhenghao; Youn, Ji Youn; Wang, Chen; Zhang, Hongchun; Cai, Hua",Pharmacol Ther,,446

430613,Insights into neurological dysfunction of critically ill COVID-19 patients,2020,"BACKGROUND: Naples prognostic score (NPS) is a scoring system based on albumin, cholesterol concentration, lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio reflecting host systemic inflammation, malnutrition, and survival for several malignancies. This study was designed to assess the prognostic significance of NPS in patients with locally advanced esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and to compare its prognostic accuracy with that of other systemic inflammatory and nutritional index. METHODS: We retrospectively examined 165 patients with locally advanced ESCC who underwent neoadjuvant therapy followed by curative resection between January 2011 and September 2019. Patients were divided into three groups based on their NPS before neoadjuvant therapy (Group 0: NPS = 0; Group 1: NPS = 1-2; Group 2: NPS = 3-4). We compared the clinicopathological characteristics and survival rates among the groups. RESULTS: The 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were significantly different between the groups (P < 0.001). The NPS was superior to other systemic inflammatory and nutritional index for predicting prognoses, as determined using area under the curves (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the NPS was a significant predictor of poor RFS (Group 1: hazard ratio [HR] 1.897, P = 0.049; Group 2: HR 3.979, P < 0.001) and OS (Group 1: HR 2.152, P = 0.033; Group 2: HR 3.239, P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that NPS was an independent prognostic factor in patients with locally advanced ESCC and more reliable and accurate than the other systemic inflammatory and nutritional index.","Kano, Kazuki; Yamada, Takanobu; Yamamoto, Kouji; Komori, Keisuke; Watanabe, Hayato; Takahashi, Kosuke; Fujikawa, Hirohito; Aoyama, Toru; Numata, Masakatsu; Tamagawa, Hiroshi; Yukawa, Norio; Rino, Yasushi; Masuda, Munetaka; Ogata, Takashi; Oshima, Takashi",Ann. surg. oncol,,446
430632,The Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology (SOAP) COVID-19 Registry: An analysis of outcomes among pregnant women delivering during the initial SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in the United States,2021,"Efforts towards slowing down coronavirus (COVID-19) transmission and reducing mortality have focused on timely case detection, isolation and treatment. Availability of laboratory COVID-19 testing capacity using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was essential for case detection. Hence, it was critical to establish and expand this capacity to test for COVID-19 in Ethiopia. To this end, using a three-phrased approach, potential public and private laboratories with RT-PCR technology were assessed, capacitated with trained human resource and equipped as required. These laboratories were verified to conduct COVID-19 testing with quality assurance checks regularly conducted. Within a 10-month period, COVID-19 testing laboratories increased from zero to 65 in all Regional States with the capacity to conduct 18,454 tests per day. The success of this rapid countrywide expansion of laboratory testing capacity for COVID-19 depended on some key operational implications: the strong laboratory coordination network within the country, the use of non-virologic laboratories, investment in capacity building, digitalization of the data for better information management and establishing quality assurance checks. A weak supply chain for laboratory reagents and consumables, differences in the brands of COVID-19 test kits, frequent breakdowns of the PCR machines and inadequate number of laboratory personnel following the adaption of a 24/7 work schedule were some of the challenges experienced during the process of laboratory expansion. Overall, we learn that multisectoral involvement of laboratories from non-health sectors, an effective supply chain system with an insight into the promotion of local production of laboratory supplies were critical during the laboratory expansion for COVID-19 testing. The consistent support from WHO and other implementing partners to Member States is needed in building the capacity of laboratories across different diagnostic capabilities in line with International Health Regulations. This will enable efficient adaptation to respond to future public health emergencies.","Kebede, Adisu; Lanyero, Betty; Beyene, Berhane; Mandalia, Mayur Lalji; Melese, Daniel; Girmachew, Feven; Mekonnen, Adamu; Ayana, Gonfa; Yemanebirhan, Nebiyou; Hailu, Getnet; Asrat, Habtamu; Nurahmed, Negash; Gashu, Andargachew; Eshetu, Kirubel; Assefa, Zewdu; Abayneh, Aschalew; Musa, Emmanuel; Abate, Ebba",Pan Afr Med J,,446

433588,The application of 6S and PDCA management strategies in the nursing of COVID-19 patients,2020,"Public parks serve an important societal function as recreational spaces for diverse communities of people, with well documented physical and mental health benefits. As such, parks may be crucial for how people have handled effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly the increasingly limited recreational opportunities, widespread financial uncertainty, and consequent heightened anxiety. Despite the documented benefits of parks, however, many states have instituted park shutdown orders due to fears that public parks could facilitate SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Here we use geotagged social media data from state, county, and local parks throughout New Jersey to examine whether park visitation increased when the COVID-19 pandemic began and whether park shutdown orders were effective at deterring park usage. We compare park usage during four discrete stages of spring 2020: (1) before the pandemic began, (2) during the beginning of the pandemic, (3) during the New Jersey governor's state-wide park shutdown order, and (4) following the lifting of the shutdown. We find that park visitation increased by 63.4% with the onset of the pandemic. The subsequent park shutdown order caused visitation in closed parks to decline by 76.1% while parks that remained open continued to experience elevated visitation levels. Visitation then returned to elevated pre-shutdown levels when closed parks were allowed to reopen. Altogether, our results indicate that parks continue to provide crucial services to society, particularly in stressful times when opportunities for recreation are limited. Furthermore, our results suggest that policies targeting human behavior can be effective and are largely reversible. As such, we should continue to invest in public parks and to explore the role of parks in managing public health and psychological well-being.","Volenec, Zoe M; Abraham, Joel O; Becker, Alexander D; Dobson, Andy P",PLoS One,,446
434074,The efficacy of remote virtual care in comparison to traditional clinical visits for elective orthopaedic patients: A meta-analysis of prospective randomised controlled trials,2021,"Screening for cancer is a proven and recommended approach to prevent deaths from cancer; screening can locate precursor lesions and/or cancer at early stages when it is potentially curable. Racial and ethnic minorities and other medically underserved populations exhibit lower uptake of cancer screening than nonminorities in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic, which disproportionately affected minority communities, has curtailed preventive services including cancer screening to preserve personal protective equipment and prevent spread of infection. While there is evidence for a rebound from the pandemic-driven reduction in cancer screening nationally, the return may not be even across all populations, with minority population screening that was already behind becoming further behind as a result of the community ravages from COVID-19. Fear of contracting COVID-19, limited access to safety-net clinics, and personal factors like, financial, employment, and transportation issues are concerns that are intensified in medically underserved communities. Prolonged delays in cancer screening will increase cancer in the overall population from pre-COVID-19 trajectories, and elevate the cancer disparity in minority populations. Knowing the overall benefit of cancer screening versus the risk of acquiring COVID-19, utilizing at-home screening tests and keeping the COVID-19-induced delay in screening to a minimum might slow the growth of disparity.","Carethers, John M; Sengupta, Rajarshi; Blakey, Rea; Ribas, Antoni; D039,; Souza, Gypsyamber",Cancer Prev Res (Phila),,446

This paper investigates how hospital departments can leverage the ability of firms to simultaneously explore new IT resources and practices (IT exploration) as well as exploit their current IT resources and practices (IT exploitation), i.e., IT ambidexterity, to adequately sense and respond to patients' needs and demands, i.e., patient agility. This study embraces the dynamic capability view and develops a research model, and tests it accordingly using cross-sectional data from 90 clinical hospital departments from the Netherlands through an online survey. The model's hypothesized relationships are tested using Partial Least Squares (PLS) structural equation modeling (SEM). The outcomes demonstrate the significance of IT ambidexterity in developing patient agility, positively influencing patient service performance. The study outcomes support the theorized model can the outcomes shed light on how to transform clinical practice and drive patient agility.","Wetering, Rogier van de",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.09415v1.pdf,446

To set the stage, we first briefly simulate and illustrate the benefit of lockdown. With these lockdown scenarios, and in general, the more dominant influence of the the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious over the symptomatic infectious, is shown in various ways. Numerical simulations for the U.S. show that an increase in testing and isolating for the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious group has up to 4 times more impact than an increase in testing for the symptomatic infectious in terms of cumulative deaths. An increase in testing for the pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infectious group also has significantly more impact (on the order of twice as much) on reducing the control reproduction number than testing for symptomatic infectious. Lastly, we use our model to simulate an implementation of a natural herd immunity strategy for the entire U.S. and for the state of Wisconsin (once an epicenter for COVID-19). These simulations provide specific examples confirming that such a strategy requires a significant number of deaths before immunity is achieved, and as such, this strategy is certainly questionable in terms of success.","Scott, Sherry E; Cook, Keisha J; Barley, Kamal",Math Biosci Eng,,446

However, the accumulation pattern seems to be species dependent. For this study, specimens of Philoscia affinis (Isopoda, Oniscidea) and soil samples were collected from both a protected area (site 1) and urban roadside (site 2) in the low plain of Friuli-Venezia Giulia (northeast Italy) to determine whether P. affinis could serve as a potential candidate for monitoring soil contamination. To do this, the following objectives were achieved: a) the level of trace elements (Al, Cd, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Pb, Zn) were detected in soils and isopods; 2) the difference in trace elements accumulation was compared in the two sampling sites; 3) the bioaccumulation factor (BAF) was calculated for each element. With some exceptions, trace element concentrations were higher in both isopods and soil samples from the urban roadside compared to the protected area. Furthermore, except for Cd, Cu, and Zn, trace element levels were higher in the soil than in the isopod samples. The higher mean BAF values were recorded for Cd (6.169 and 6.974 for site 1 and 2, respectively), Cu (10.324 and 11.452 for site 1 and 2, respectively), and Zn (1.836 and 2: 1.943 for site 1 and 2, respectively), whereas BAF values <1 were recorded for the other elements. Philoscia affinis was found to be a potential candidate to monitor soil contamination as a macro-concentrator of Cu and Cd and a micro-concentrator of Zn.","Pastorino, Paolo; Bertoli, Marco; Brizio, Paola; Abete, Maria Cesarina; Dalla Nora, Vittoria; Prearo, Marino; Pizzul, Elisabetta",Biol. trace elem. res,,446

People living in Puerto Rico face significant levels of poverty, a deficient infrastructure, a fragile healthcare system and the continuing dismantling of the public education system as well as hazardous environmental exposures. The treatment of Puerto Ricans as second-class citizens due to the federal policies of the U.S. government and also the mismanagement of funds from local authorities impacts the prevalence of chronic health conditions and vulnerability to disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes and pandemics. Puerto Rico's health disparities are rooted in historical, cultural, political and economic factors that have an impact on biology, interpersonal and environmental aspects. In order to significantly reduce health disparities, systemic change is needed at a local, national and federal level. Interventions must consider how social determinants impact the quality of life and seek to impact the intersections of different contexts that have an effect at an individual, interpersonal, communal and societal level. This can be achieved through evidence-based, culturally appropriate and community based as well as translational research approaches that seek to impact behavior and social economic factors.","Lafarga Previdi, Irene; Vélez Vega, Carmen M",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,446

The question at hand was whether individual nutcrackers cached food items-and then later retrieved them-differently depending upon whether they were being observed by a conspecific or not at the time of caching. Tornick and Gibson (2021) found that individual nutcrackers were highly sensitive to whether they were being observed by a conspecific. When they were being observed, nutcrackers cached more food items behind the barrier than in the visible area of their cage. However, in the ""private"" condition when they were not being observed, nutcrackers cached food items roughly equally in the two areas.

We present a small drug molecule design pipeline based on graph-generative models and a comparison study of two state-of-the-art graph generative models for designing COVID-19 targeted drug candidates: 1) a variational autoencoder-based approach (VAE) that uses prior knowledge of molecules that have been shown to be effective for earlier coronavirus treatments and 2) a deep Q-learning method (DQN) that generates optimized molecules without any proximity constraints. We evaluate the novelty of the automated molecule generation approaches by validating the candidate molecules with drug-protein binding affinity models. The VAE method produced two novel molecules with similar structures to the antiretroviral protease inhibitor Indinavir that show potential binding affinity for the SARS-CoV-2 protein target 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL-protease).,"Ward, Logan; Bilbrey, Jenna A.; Choudhury, Sutanay; Kumar, Neeraj; Sivaraman, Ganesh",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.04977v1.pdf,446

A prospective observational study,2021,"AIM: Penicillin allergy labels are frequently encountered in children and are associated with significant harms. Most children are falsely labelled and can safely tolerate a penicillin but delabelling strategies are underutilised and paediatric-specific resources are lacking. The aim of this study was to evaluate an allergy assessment tool for children in hospital. METHODS: We evaluated a paediatric-adapted penicillin allergy assessment tool, using an online survey of clinicians in a tertiary paediatric hospital, with 10 hypothetical potential penicillin allergy or adverse reaction cases (including non-allergy reactions). For each case, respondents were asked to use the tool to assign a reaction phenotype and recommend management. We determined the tool's sensitivity, specificity and acceptability to end users. RESULTS: We evaluated 30 complete survey responses from senior and junior medical staff, nurses and pharmacists. The tool's overall sensitivity was 80.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 74.2-87.1%) for assigning the correct reaction phenotype and 85.3% (95% CI 79.4-91.3%) for appropriate management. The tool had high sensitivity for identifying immediate hypersensitivity reactions at 95.6% (95% CI 90.2-100%). Most respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they would use the tool in their practice (22/30, 73.3%). CONCLUSION: This survey evaluated a paediatric-adapted penicillin allergy assessment tool in a tertiary paediatric hospital among multidisciplinary clinician groups. The tool performed well overall and had high safety in identifying immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Further research to support implementation of allergy assessment and delabelling programmes among children is required.","Rischin, Kobi J; Mostaghim, Mona; Rao, Arjun; Smith, Bridget; O039,; Brien, Tracey A; Trubiano, Jason A; Frith, Katie; McMullan, Brendan",J. paediatr. child health,,446

Objective: The aim of this article is to describe negative influence of Corona pandemic (COVID-19) for realization of the WHO project about Healthy Aging global strategy proposed in the targets ""Health for all"". Methods: Authors used descriptive model for this cross-sectional study based on facts in analyzed scientific literature deposited in on-line databases about healthy aging concept of the prevention and treatment of the people who will come or already came to the ""third trimester of the life"". Results and Discussion: Some 80-year-olds have levels of physical and mental capacity that compare favorably with 30-year-olds. Others of the same age may require extensive care and support for basic activities like dressing and eating. Policy should be framed to improve the functional ability of all older people, whether they are robust, care dependent or in between. Inequity reflects a large proportion (approximately 75%) of the diversity in capacity and circumstance observed in older age is the result of the cumulative impact of advantage and disadvantage across people's lives.

Given that elevated health anxiety can contribute to maladaptive health behaviors, there is a need to identify individual difference factors that may increase health anxiety risk. This study examined the unique and interactive relations of COVID-19 affective risk assessments (worry about risk for contracting/dying from COVID-19) and intolerance of uncertainty to later health anxiety dimensions. A U.S. community sample of 364 participants completed online self-report measures at a baseline assessment (Time 1) and one month later (Time 2). Time 1 intolerance of uncertainty was uniquely associated with the Time 2 health anxiety dimension of body vigilance. Time 1 affective risk assessments and intolerance of uncertainty were uniquely associated with later perceived likelihood that an illness would be acquired and anticipated negative consequences of an illness. The latter finding was qualified by a significant interaction, such that affective risk assessments were positively associated with anticipated negative consequences of having an illness only among participants with mean and low levels of intolerance of uncertainty. Results speak to the relevance of different risk factors for health anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight targets for reducing health anxiety risk.","Tull, Matthew T; Barbano, Anna C; Scamaldo, Kayla M; Richmond, Julia R; Edmonds, Keith A; Rose, Jason P; Gratz, Kim L",J Anxiety Disord,,446

This impact is likely to be stronger for people with autism as they are at heightened risk of mental health problems and because the pandemic directly affects social functioning and everyday routines. We therefore examined COVID-19 pandemic-related changes in mental health, the impact of the pandemic on their social life and routines, satisfaction with pandemic-related information and tips, and participants' wishes for guidance. METHODS: We used a mixed-method approach, collecting quantitative and qualitative survey data from adults with and without autism across three European countries: Belgium, the Netherlands, and the UK (N = 1044). RESULTS: We found an increase in depression and anxiety symptoms in response to the pandemic for both the non-autism and the autism group, which was greater for adults with autism. Furthermore, adults with autism showed a greater increase in worries about their pets, work, getting medication and food, and their own safety/security. They felt more relieved from social stress, yet experienced the loss of social contact as difficult. Adults with autism also felt more stressed about the loss of routines. Pleasant changes noted by adults with autism were the increase in solidarity and reduced sensory and social overload. Adults with autism frequently reported problems with cancellation of guidance due to the pandemic and expressed their wish for (more) autism-specific information and advice. LIMITATIONS: Our sample is likely to reflect some degree of selection bias, and longitudinal studies are needed to determine long-term effects. CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the psychological burden of the pandemic on adults with autism and shed light on how to support them during this COVID-19 pandemic, which is especially important now that the pandemic is likely to have a prolonged course. There is a need for accessible, affordable (continued) support from health services. Guidance may focus on the maintenance of a social network, and adjusting routines to the rapid ongoing changes. Finally, we may learn from the COVID-19 pandemic-related changes experienced as pleasant by adults with autism to build a more autism-friendly society post-pandemic.","Oomen, Danna; Nijhof, Annabel D; Wiersema, Jan R",Mol Autism,,446

We searched across 14 databases, executing the search at two different time points. We included published, observational and experimental studies that reported the psychological effects on HSCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our study indicates that COVID-19 has a considerable impact on the psychological wellbeing of front-line hospital staff. Results suggest that nurses may be at higher risk of adverse mental health outcomes during this pandemic, but no studies compare this group with the primary care workforce. Furthermore, no studies investigated the psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on social care staff. Other risk factors identified were underlying organic illness, gender (female), concern about family, fear of infection, lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and close contact with COVID-19. Systemic support, adequate knowledge and resilience were identified as factors protecting against adverse mental health outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence to date suggests that female nurses with close contact with COVID-19 patients may have the most to gain from efforts aimed at supporting psychological well-being. However, inconsistencies in findings and a lack of data collected outside of hospital settings, suggest that we should not exclude any groups when addressing psychological well-being in health and social care workers. Whilst psychological interventions aimed at enhancing resilience in the individual may be of benefit, it is evident that to build a resilient workforce, occupational and environmental factors must be addressed. Further research including social care workers and analysis of wider societal structural factors is recommended.","De Kock, Johannes H; Latham, Helen Ann; Leslie, Stephen J; Grindle, Mark; Munoz, Sarah-Anne; Ellis, Liz; Polson, Rob; O039,; Malley, Christopher M",BMC Public Health,,446
452708,"Comment on ""Respiratory mechanics and gas exchanges in the early course of COVID-19 ARDS: a hypothesis-generating study""",2020,"By the middle of May 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had infected nearly five million people and had spread to almost all countries worldwide. In response, many countries all over the world have used different methods to reduce the infection rate, such as including case isolation, the closure of schools and universities, banning public events, and mostly forcing social distancing, including local and national lockdowns. In our work, we use a Monte-Carlo (MC) based algorithm to predict the virus infection rate for different population densities using the most recent epidemic data. We test the spread of the Coronavirus using three different lockdown models, and eight various combinations of constraints, which allow us to examine the efficiency of each model and constraint. The main prediction of this model is that a cyclic schedule of one week without restrictions and two weeks of lockdown can help to control the virus infection. In particular, this model reduces the infection rate when accompanied by social distancing and complete isolation of symptomatic patients.","De-Leon, Hilla; Pederiva, Francesco",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.10357v1.pdf,446
454969,Caution about early intubation and mechanical ventilation in COVID-19,2020,"OBJECTIVE: Assess the knowledge, confidence, and attitudes of residents towards disaster medicine education in the COVID-19 era. METHODS: Survey distributed to pediatric residents at a tertiary care center, assessing confidence in disaster medicine knowledge and skills and preferred educational methods. Based on residents' responses, virtual and in-person educational session implemented with post-survey to analyze effectiveness of education. RESULTS: Distributed to 120 residents with a 51.6% response rate. Almost half (46.8%) of residents had less than 1 hour of disaster training, with only 9.7% having experience with a prior disaster event. However, most residents were motivated to increase their knowledge of disaster medicine due to COVID-19 and other recent disasters, with 96.8% interested in this education as a curriculum standard. Simulation and peer learning were the most preferred method of teaching. Subsequent virtual and in-person educational session demonstrated improvement in confidence scores. However, 66.7% of the virtual subset conveyed they would have preferred in-person learning. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has highlighted to trainees that disasters can affect all specialties, and pediatric residents are enthusiastic to close the educational gap of disaster medicine. However, residents stressed that although virtual education can provide a foundation, in-person simulation is preferred for effective training.","Boggs, Kaitlyn; Goodwin, Tress; Simpson, Joelle",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,446

465461,A Case of 45-Year Man Who Succumbed to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19),2020,"Background: The best scientific evidence is required to design effective Non-pharmaceutical interventions to help policymakers to contain COVID-19. Aim: To describe which Non-pharmaceutical interventions used different countries and a when they use them. It also explores how Non-pharmaceutical interventions impact the number of cases, the mortality, and the capacity of health systems. Methods: We consulted eight web pages of transnational organizations, 17 of international media, 99 of government institutions in the 19 countries included, and besides, we included nine studies (out of 34 identified) that met inclusion criteria. Result: Some countries are focused on establishing travel restrictions, isolation of identified cases, and high-risk people. Others have a combination of mandatory quarantine and other drastic social distancing measures. The timing to implement the interventions varied from the first fifteen days after detecting the first case to more than 30 days. The effectiveness of isolated non-pharmaceutical interventions may be limited, but combined interventions have shown to be effective in reducing the transmissibility of the disease, the collapse of health care services, and mortality. When the number of new cases has been controlled, it is necessary to maintain social distancing measures, self-isolation, and contact tracing for several months. The policy decision-making in this time should be aimed to optimize the opportunities of saving lives, reducing the collapse of health services, and minimizing the economic and social impact over the general population, but principally over the most vulnerable. The timing of implementing and lifting interventions could have a substantial effect on those objectives.","Patiño-Lugo, Daniel F; Vélez, Marcela; Velásquez Salazar, Pamela; Vera-Giraldo, Claudia Yaneth; Vélez, Viviana; Marín, Isabel Cristina; Ramírez, Paola Andrea; Quintero, Sebastián Pemberthy; Castrillón Martínez, Esteban; Pineda Higuita, Daniel Andrés; Henandez, Gilma",Colomb Med (Cali),,446

METHODS: A survey-based study focused on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and single-arm studies for acute ischemic stroke and cerebral aneurysms was developed by a group of senior neurointerventionalists and sent to sites identified through the clinical trials website (https://clinicaltrials.gov/), study sponsors, and physician investigators. RESULTS: The survey was sent to 101 institutions, with 65 responding (64%). Stroke RCTs were being conducted at 40 (62%) sites, aneurysm RCTs at 22 (34%) sites, stroke single-arm studies at 37 (57%) sites, and aneurysm single-arm studies at 43 (66%) sites. Following COVID-19, enrollment was suspended at 51 (78%) sites-completely at 21 (32%) and partially at 30 (46%) sites. Missed trial-related clinics and imaging follow-ups and protocol deviations were reported by 27 (42%), 24 (37%), and 27 (42%) sites, respectively. Negative reimbursements were reported at 17 (26%) sites. The majority of sites, 49 (75%), had put new trials on hold. Of the coordinators, 41 (63%) worked from home and 20 (31%) reported a personal financial impact. Remote consent was possible for some studies at 34 (52%) sites and for all studies at 5 (8%) sites.

468890,Treatment of ST-Segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction During COVID-19 Pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: The NHS Mental Health Implementation Plan aims to reduce length of inpatient psychiatric stays to a maximum of 32 days, yet provides little guidance on how to achieve this. Previous studies have attempted to analyse factors influencing length of stay in mental health units, focussing mostly on patient factors. These models fail to sufficiently explain the variation in duration of inpatient stay. We assess how the type of service delivered by a trust, in addition to patient factors, influences length of stay. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective case cohort study in a large inner-city NHS mental health trust for all admissions in a 1 month period. Data was gathered from electronic notes of 105 patients. Descriptive univariate and bivariate analyses were conducted on the data, with multiple regression analysis conducted on statistically significant data. RESULTS: Short-stay assessment ward admission significantly reduced length of stay. Patients under outpatients or under care co-ordination, admitted through Mental Health Act assessment and formally detained all had longer length of stay. Out of area admissions, locum Consultant care, changing Responsible Clinician and ward transfers all led to longer length of stay. Factors indicating more severe illness such as increased observation level and polypharmacy, as well as diagnoses of psychosis or bipolar disorder were associated with longer duration of stay. Discharges requiring referral to accommodation or rehabilitation led to longer stays. The most significant factors that influenced length of stay were higher observation levels, diagnosis of psychotic illness or bipolar, and discharge to rehabilitation placement. The final model, taking into account all these factors, was able to account for 59.6% of the variability in length of stay. CONCLUSIONS: The study backs up existing literature which shows patient-factors have an influence on length of stay. The study also demonstrates that service-level factors have an impact on the duration of stay. This data may be used to inform further studies which may aid provision of inpatient and community services in the future.","Crossley, Neil; Sweeney, Brian",BMC Psychiatry,,446

It refers to a heterogeneous group of metabolic disorders caused by the enzymatic deficiency in the biosynthesis of the heme group. Acute intermittent porphyria is caused by a deficiency of the porphobilinogen deaminase enzyme. A 40-year-old woman presented with abdominal pain for ten days (which required laparotomy that evidenced no surgical pathology), severe hydroelectrolytic disorder due to hyponatremia and resistant hypokalemia, persistent tachycardia and hypertension. Seven days later, she developed acute flabby quadriparesis and presented a single generalized tonic-clonic convulsive crisis. Neurophysiological studies supported mixed axonal polyneuropathy and urine results of porphobilinogen and porphyrins were elevated. After acute intermittent porphyria was diagnosed, hemin was administered, which stabilized the patient's clinical signs and normalized the porphobilinogen. The prevalence of this entity is 1 in 2,000 people. It is an autosomal dominant disease, which affects mainly women between 20 and 40 years of age. This entity manifests with neurological and visceral symptoms. Management consists of hematin and dextrose administration avoiding hypotonic solutions because of the risk of exacerbating hyponatremia.","Bustos, José; Vargas, Ledmar; Quintero, Ricardo",Biomedica,,446

476558,"In Our Covid World, Don't Forget about Influenza: Fulminant Myocarditis Caused by Influenza B",2021,"BACKGROUND: Due to social and geographical isolation, indigenous people are more vulnerable to adverse conditions; however, there is a lack of data on the epidemics' impact on these populations. Thus, this article's objective was to describe the epidemiological situation of COVID-19 in indigenous communities in Brazil. METHODS: This descriptive observational study was carried out in indigenous communities in the municipality of Amaturá (Amazonas, Brazil). Individuals from the Alto Rio Solimões Special Indigenous Sanitary District (DSEI) who met the Sars-Cov-2 infection case definitions during the period between January and August 2020 were included. For case notification, the definitions adopted by the Ministry of Health of Brazil and by the Special Secretariat for Indigenous Health were considered. RESULTS: Out of the entire population served by the Alto Rio Solimões DSEI (n = 2890), 109 indigenous people were suspected of having been infected with Sars-Cov-R during the study period; a total of 89 cases were actually confirmed (rate: 3.08 cases/100,000 inhabitants). Most patients diagnosed with COVID-19 were female (56.2%), with a mean age of 32.4 (± 23.6) years. Predominant symptoms were fever (76.4%), dry cough (64%), and headache (60.7%). Complications occurred in 7.9% of the patients; no deaths were reported. CONCLUSION: These results enhance the observation that indigenous populations, even if relatively isolated, are exposed to COVID-19. The disease cases assessed showed a favorable evolution, which does not mean reducing the need for caring of this population.","da Silva, Marina Goulart; Pereira, Pablo Michel Barcelos; Portela, Williams Ferreira; Daros, Guilherme Cabreira; Barbosa, Caio Roberto de Almeida; Vanassi, Bruna Muraro; Parma, Gabriel Oscar Cremona; de Bitencourt, Rafael Mariano; Iser, Betine Pinto Moehlecke",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,446

In particular, we present an algorithm that leverages information obtained from non-template and/or DNA extraction-control experiments to remove systematic bias from amplification curves. We recast this problem in terms of mathematical optimization, i.e. by finding the amount of control signal that, when subtracted from an amplification curve, minimizes background noise. We demonstrate that this approach can yield a decade improvement in sensitivity relative to standard approaches, especially for data exhibiting late-cycle amplification. Critically, this increased sensitivity and accuracy promises more effective screening of viral DNA and a reduction in the rate of false-negatives in diagnostic settings.","Patrone, Paul N.; Kearsley, Anthony J.; Romsos, Erica L.; Vallone, Peter M.",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05466v1.pdf,446

Here, we present a new method for identifying adaptive evolution on short evolutionary time scales with densely-sampled populations. We apply this method to SARS-CoV-2 to perform a comprehensive analysis of adaptively-evolving regions of the genome. We find that spike S1 is a focal point of adaptive evolution, but also identify positively-selected mutations in other genes that are sculpting the evolutionary trajectory of SARS-CoV-2. Protein-coding mutations in S1 are temporally-clustered and, in 2021, the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence in S1 is more than 4 times greater than in the equivalent influenza HA1 subunit.","Kistler, Kathryn; Huddleston, John; Bedford, Trevor",,,446

An in silico competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) analysis has been carried on SARS-CoV-2. The results suggest that, in humans, the decrease of microRNA activity caused by viral RNAs can lead to a perturbation of vesicle trafficking and the inflammatory response, in particular by enhancing KLF10 activity. The results suggest also that, during the study of the mechanics of viral infections, it could be of general interest to investigate the competition of viral RNA with cellular transcripts for shared microRNAs.","Arancio, Walter",Arch. virol,,446

489292,ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction Due to Acute Thrombosis in an Adolescent With COVID-19,2021,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with the Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID-19) are at increased risk for thrombotic events and mortality. Various anticoagulation regimens are now being considered for these patients. Anticoagulation is known to increase the risk for adverse bleeding events, of which intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is one of the most feared. We present a retrospective study of 33 patients positive for COVID-19 with neuroimaging-documented ICH and examine anticoagulation use in this population. METHODS: Patients over the age of 18 with confirmed COVID-19 and radiographic evidence of ICH were included in this study. Evidence of hemorrhage was confirmed and categorized by a fellowship trained neuroradiologist. Electronic health records were analyzed for patient information including demographic data, medical history, hospital course, laboratory values, and medications. RESULTS: We identified 33 COVID-19 positive patients with ICH, mean age 61.6 years (range 37-83 years), 21.2% of whom were female. Parenchymal hemorrhages with mass effect and herniation occurred in 5 (15.2%) patients, with a 100% mortality rate. Of the remaining 28 patients with ICH, 7 (25%) had punctate hemorrhages, 17 (60.7%) had small- moderate size hemorrhages, and 4 (14.3%) had a large single site of hemorrhage without evidence of herniation. Almost all patients received either therapeutic dose anticoagulation (in 22 [66.7%] patients) or prophylactic dose (in 3 [9.1] patients) prior to ICH discovery. CONCLUSIONS: Anticoagulation therapy may be considered in patients with COVID-19 though the risk of ICH should be taken into account when developing a treatment regimen.","Dogra, Siddhant; Jain, Rajan; Cao, Meng; Bilaloglu, Seda; Zagzag, David; Hochman, Sarah; Lewis, Ariane; Melmed, Kara; Hochman, Katherine; Horwitz, Leora; Galetta, Steven; Berger, Jeffrey",J Stroke Cerebrovasc Dis,,446

With the growing attention on the deadly pandemic, discussions and research on COVID-19 are rapidly increasing to exchange latest findings with the hope to accelerate the pace of finding a cure. As a branch of information technology, artificial intelligence (AI) has greatly expedited the development of human society. In this paper, we investigate and visualize the on-going advancements of early scientific research on COVID-19 from the perspective of AI. By adopting the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, this paper allocates the research articles into 50 key research topics pertinent to COVID-19 according to their abstracts. We present an overview of early studies of the COVID-19 crisis at different scales including referencing/citation behavior, topic variation and their inner interactions. We also identify innovative papers that are regarded as the cornerstones in the development of COVID-19 research. The results unveil the focus of scientific research, thereby giving deep insights into how the academic society contributes to combating the COVID-19 pandemic.","Liu, Jiaying Nie Hansong Li Shihao Chen Xiangtai Cao Huazhu Ren Jing Lee Ivan Xia Feng",Big Data Research,,446

OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates qualitative outcomes with data insights from the electronic health record, to contrast satisfaction outcomes with the actual use of VC. METHODS: Healthcare providers and patients using VC during the COVID-19 pandemic at a large academic centre in the Netherlands were surveyed for user satisfaction and experiences with VC. In addition, quantitative technical assessment was performed using data related to VC from the EHR record. RESULTS: In total, 1,027/4,443 patients and 87/166 healthcare providers completed their online questionnaire. Users rated the use of VC during a pandemic with an average score of 8.3/10 and 7.6/10 respectively. Both groups believed the use of VC was a good solution to continue the provision of healthcare during this pandemic. The use of VC increased from 92 in March 2020 to 837 in April 2020. CONCLUSION: This study strongly signals that VC is an important modality in futureproofing outpatient care during and beyond pandemic times. Further development in end-user technology is needed for EHR integrated VC solutions. Guidelines needs to be developed advising both patients and healthcare providers. Such guidelines should not solely focus on technical implementation and troubleshooting, but must also consider important aspects such as digital health literacy, patient and provider authentication, privacy and ethics.","Barsom, E Z; Meijer, H A W; Blom, J; Schuuring, M J; Bemelman, W A; Schijven, M P",Int J Med Inform,,446
495421,Classification and analysis of outcome predictors in non-critically ill COVID-19 patients,2021,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) causing the COVID-19 respiratory disease pandemic utilizes unique 2'-O-methyltransferase (2'-O-MTase) capping machinery to camouflage its RNA from innate immune recognition. The nsp16 catalytic subunit of the 2'-O-MTase is unusual in its requirement for a stimulatory subunit (nsp10) to catalyze the ribose 2'-O-methylation of the viral RNA cap. Here we provide a computational basis for drug repositioning or de novo drug development based on three differential traits of the intermolecular interactions of the SARS-CoV-2-specific nsp16/nsp10 heterodimer, namely: (1) the S-adenosyl-l-methionine-binding pocket of nsp16, (2) the unique ""activating surface"" between nsp16 and nsp10, and (3) the RNA-binding groove of nsp16. We employed &#8776;9000 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved investigational and experimental drugs from the DrugBank repository for docking virtual screening. After molecular dynamics calculations of the stability of the binding modes of high-scoring nsp16/nsp10-drug complexes, we considered their pharmacological overlapping with functional modules of the virus-host interactome that is relevant to the viral lifecycle, and to the clinical features of COVID-19. Some of the predicted drugs (e.g., tegobuvir, sonidegib, siramesine, antrafenine, bemcentinib, itacitinib, or phthalocyanine) might be suitable for repurposing to pharmacologically reactivate innate immune restriction and antagonism of SARS-CoV-2 RNAs lacking 2'-O-methylation.","Encinar, José Antonio; Menendez, Javier A",Viruses,,446

Patients with cardiovascular risk and previous kidney risk have been identified as especially vulnerable for greater morbidity and mortality when they suffer from COVID-19. A considerable proportion of patients can develop a vascular lesion in the context of the disease that entails a greater lethality. Cardiovascular and renal complications represent a problem and, probably in the near future, may pose a threat to patients who have survived COVID-19. As physicians, we cannot forget that during an epidemic like this, other chronic diseases are present, and patients continue to require care. We are obliged to monitor even more intensely their treatments and control degree. Furthermore, we must not forget that urgent situations continue to arise in this pandemic situation and require prompt attention. In this current situation, it is very likely that many patients, out of fear, have not sought medical attention. The situation during the epidemic and the uncertainty of the post-COVID-19 period, requires intensification in the control and monitoring of cardiovascular and kidney disease in our patients. Primary care constitutes a key level of care for the care of the population with cardiovascular disease. Likewise, and in the face of this new health scenario, we need to promote the prevention and control measures that emanate from the studies currently underway. Now, more than ever, we need research, crucial to improve the cardiovascular and renal prognosis of our patients.","Pallarés Carratalá, V; Górriz-Zambrano, C; Morillas Ariño, C; Llisterri Caro, J L; Gorriz, J L",Semergen,,446

This study aimed to further clarify the determinants and clinical risk factors of the disease severity in patients infected with COVID-19. METHODS: A multi-centre descriptive study on all patients who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the province of Tehran from March 2020 up to Dec 2020 was conducted. Data on socio-demographic characteristics, clinical presentations, comorbidities, and the health outcomes of 205,654 patients were examined. Characteristics of the study population were described. To assess the association of study variables with the disease severity, the Chi-Squared test and Multiple Logistic Regression model were applied. RESULTS: The mean age of the study population was 52.8 years and 93,612 (45.5%) were women. About half of the patients have presented with low levels of blood oxygen saturation. The ICU admission rate was 17.8% and the overall mortality rate was 10.0%. Older age, male sex, comorbidities including hypertension, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases other than asthma, chronic liver diseases, chronic kidney diseases, chronic neurological disorders, and HIV/AIDS infection were risk markers of poor health outcome. Clinical presentations related with worse prognosis included fever, difficulty breathing, impaired consciousness, and cutaneous manifestations. CONCLUSION: These results might alert physicians to pay attention to determinants and risk factors associated with poor prognosis in patients with COVID-19. In addition, our findings aid decision makers to emphasise on vulnerable groups in the public health strategies that aim at preventing the spread of the disease and its mortalities.","Sohrabi, Mohammad-Reza; Amin, Rozhin; Maher, Ali; Bahadorimonfared, Ayad; Janbazi, Shahriar; Hannani, Khatereh; Kolahi, Ali-Asghar; Zali, Ali-Reza",BMC Infect Dis,,446

509210,"Characteristics, treatment, outcomes and cause of death of invasively ventilated patients with COVID-19 ARDS in Milan, Italy",2020,"BACKGROUND: Traditionally, medical students learn surgical skills through the observation of a resident or a surgeon performing the technique. Due to inconsistent practice opportunities in the clinical setting, a disparity of skill levels among students has been observed. In addition, the poor availability of faculty professors is a limiting factor in teaching and adequately preparing medical students for clerkship years. With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, medical students do not have access to traditional suturing learning opportunities. Didactic courses are available on videoconferencing platforms, but they do not include technical training. OBJECTIVE: Our overarching goal is to evaluate the efficacy and usability of web-based peer-learning for advanced suturing techniques (i.e., running subcuticular sutures). We will use GEN (Gamified Educational Network), a newly developed online learning tool. We will assess students' ability to identify and to perform the right technique. We will also assess students' satisfaction with regards to GEN. METHODS: We will conduct a prospective randomized controlled trial with blinding of expert examiners. First-year medical students in the Faculty of Medicine of Université de Montréal will be randomized to four groups: 1) control group, 2) self-learning, 3) peer-learning, and 4) peer-learning with expert feedback. Each arm will have 15 participants who will learn how to perform running subcuticular sutures through videos on GEN. For our primary outcome, students' ability to identify the right technique will be evaluated before and after the intervention on GEN. They will view eight videos and rate the surgical technique using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS) Global Rating Scale (GRS) and the Subcuticular Suture Checklist as evaluation criteria. For our secondary outcomes, students will anonymously record themselves performing a running subcuticular suture and will be evaluated using the same scales. Then, a survey will be sent to assess the acceptance of students. RESULTS: The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and has been approved by our institutional review board (CERSES 20-068-D). No participants have been recruited yet. CONCLUSIONS: Peer-learning through GEN has the potential to overcome significant limitations related to the pandemic and the lack of availability of faculty professors. Further, a decrease of the anxiety related to traditional suturing classes can be expected. We aim to create an innovative and sustainable method of teaching surgical skills to improve the efficiency and the quality of surgical training in medical faculties.

514755,COVID-19 pandemic is associated with mechanical complications in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction,2021,"PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pediatric Emergency Departments (PEDs) have experienced unique considerations throughout the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We review the adaptations and challenges surrounding the preparation and response for pediatric emergency patients, with a specific focus on operational modifications, evolving personal protected equipment (PPE) needs, protected resuscitation responses, clinical characteristics in children, and the unintended effects on children and youth. RECENT FINDINGS: COVID-19 has thus far proven to have a milder course in children, with manifestations ranging from asymptomatic carriage or typical viral symptoms, to novel clinical entities such as 'COVID toes' and multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), the latter associated with potentially significant morbidity. It has had an important effect on primary prevention, injury rates, reduced presentations for emergency care, and increased mental health, abuse and neglect rates in children and youth. PEDs have prepared successfully. The most significant adjustments have occurred with screening, testing, and consistent and effective use of PPE, along with protected responses to resuscitation, adaptations to maintain family-centered care, and technological advances in communication and virtual care. Simulation has been key to the successful implementation of many of these strategies. SUMMARY: COVID-19 has pushed PEDs to rapidly adapt to evolving clinical and societal needs, with both resultant challenges and positive advances. Further experience and research will guide how in the face of a global pandemic we can further optimize the clinical and operational care of children and youth, ensure robust educational training programs, and maintain provider safety and wellness.","Beno, Suzanne; Ross, Caitlin; Principi, Tania",Curr Opin Pediatr,,446
515908,"Sedation, narcotic and neuromuscular blockade in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19",2021,"Recent statistics of Coronavirus diseases in Korea are studied with respect to many other countries. It is found that as of 8 February 2021, Korea has recorded 15.8 patients per 10,000 people, and this is used to calculate ratio to compare with other countries. On average, the number of Coronavirus patients in the world is 136.2 that is 8.6 times more than in Korea. The number of Covid-19 patients recorded in Korea is relatively smaller than other countries. There was no clear evidence on the atmospheric transport of Coronaviruses over 1 km to cause infection to other people. The infection of Coronaviruses appeared to occur mainly by close contact with an infected person or by airborne droplets in confined indoor environments, as noted earlier (Lancet, Respir Med 8(12):1159, 2020). To reduce the transmission of Coronavirus and related infections, the wearing of a pollution filter (mask) covering the nose and mouth is mandatory for Coronavirus patients. For the general public, however, we have invented a filter which covers only the nose. When there is no need for conversation and deep breathing, the nose band would be sufficient to filter out Coronavirus and air pollutants. Meanwhile, air and sea port activities including ground transport continued and strict policy on people mingle was not tightly enforced, and control measures to reduce infection were not so effective. However, it is believed that consuming fermented Korean spicy Kimchee and hot peppery soup plus warm rice tea helps in washing Coronaviruses around the throat deep down to the stomach. We find that cleansing the mouth and throat deeply including pathway is better than doing shallow gargling. A possible mechanism for cleansing the mouth and throat of Coronaviruses is here explored. This could have contributed to the relatively small number of Coronavirus patients observed in Korea.","Chung, Y S",Air Qual Atmos Health,,446

As of February 6, 2021, over 105 million persons have been infected in 223 countries and there have been 2,290,488 deaths. As a result, emergency medical services and hospital systems have undergone unprecedented healthcare delivery reconfigurations. Here, we review the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) epidemiology and systems of care. RECENT FINDINGS: Areas severely affected by the pandemic have reported increased incidence of OHCA, lower rates of successful resuscitation, and increased mortality. COVID-19 has significantly impacted patient outcomes through increased disease severity, decreased access to care, and the reshaping of emergency medical response and hospital-based healthcare systems and policies. The pandemic has negatively influenced attitudes toward resuscitation and challenged providers with novel ethical dilemmas provoked by the scarcity of healthcare resources. SUMMARY: The COVID-19 pandemic has had direct, indirect, psychosocial, and ethical impacts on the cardiac arrest chain of survival.","Kovach, Christopher P; Perman, Sarah M",Curr Opin Crit Care,,446

520967,Early prone position for COVID-19 patients with severe hypoxia: reduces the mortality but increases the intubation risk?,2020,"Influenza viruses annually kill 290,000-650,000 people worldwide. Antivirals can reduce death tolls. Baloxavir, the recently approved influenza antiviral, inhibits initiation of viral mRNA synthesis, whereas oseltamivir, an older drug, inhibits release of virus progeny. Baloxavir blocks virus replication more rapidly and completely than oseltamivir, reducing the duration of infectiousness. Hence, early baloxavir treatment may indirectly prevent transmission. Here, we estimate impacts of ramping up and accelerating baloxavir treatment on population-level incidence using a new model that links viral load dynamics from clinical trial data to between-host transmission. We estimate that ~22 million infections and >6,000 deaths would have been averted in the 2017-2018 epidemic season by administering baloxavir to 30% of infected cases within 48 h after symptom onset. Treatment within 24 h would almost double the impact. Consequently, scaling up early baloxavir treatment would substantially reduce influenza morbidity and mortality every year. The development of antivirals against the SARS-CoV2 virus that function like baloxavir might similarly curtail transmission and save lives.","Du, Zhanwei; Nugent, Ciara; Galvani, Alison P; Krug, Robert M; Meyers, Lauren Ancel",Nat Commun,,446

Continuous physical activity data for steps walked per week (n = 730) and miles run per week (n = 264) were analysed over the first period of lockdown and subsequent restriction easing using negative binomial mixed models for repeated measures. Throughout the observation period, more steps were walked by males compared to females, and by White groups compared to all other ethnic groups combined. However, there was a gradual increase in the number of steps walked per week following the commencement of lockdown, irrespective of sociodemographic characteristics. For females only, there was a decrease in the number of miles run per week following lockdown. The long-term impact of the pandemic on physical health is unknown, but our results highlight changes in physical activity which could have implications for physical health.","Wickersham, Alice; Carr, Ewan; Hunt, Ryan; Davis, Jordan P; Hotopf, Matthew; Fear, Nicola T; Downs, Johnny; Leightley, Daniel",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,446

The first U.S. cases were identified in January 2020. METHODS: To determine if SARS-CoV-2 reactive antibodies were present in sera prior to the first identified case in the U.S. on January 19, 2020, residual archived samples from 7,389 routine blood donations collected by the American Red Cross from December 13, 2019 to January 17, 2020, from donors resident in nine states (California, Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington, and Wisconsin) were tested at CDC for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Specimens reactive by pan-immunoglobulin (pan Ig) enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) against the full spike protein were tested by IgG and IgM ELISAs, microneutralization test, Ortho total Ig S1 ELISA, and receptor binding domain / Ace2 blocking activity assay. RESULTS: Of the 7,389 samples, 106 were reactive by pan Ig. Of these 106 specimens, 90 were available for further testing. Eighty four of 90 had neutralizing activity, 1 had S1 binding activity, and 1 had receptor binding domain / Ace2 blocking activity >50%, suggesting the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibodies.

The present study aimed to assess the protective role of novel phosphorylated analogue ABC‐1 in vivo in NDV‐infected chickens through the inhibition of fusion protein. Both NDV‐induced oxidative damage and protective role of novel phosphorylated ABC‐1 were evaluated in vital organs such as the liver and lung of chickens. Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) results showed that protein oxidation and nitration levels were significantly raised in NDV‐infected tissues compared to healthy controls, whereas these levels were reduced significantly (P < 0.05) in birds treated with phosphorylated compounds compared to the NDV‐infected group alone. Additional investigation with double immunofluorescence showed that the large amount of immuno colocalization and Western blot analysis also confirmed this observation through its band pattern in NDV‐infected birds compared to healthy birds, whereas these alterations were reduced in treatment with novel phosphorylated ABC‐1. The expression of fusion glycoprotein was studied by immuno colocalization, PCR, and flow cytometry, and results demonstrated that the novel phosphorylated analogues reduced the expression of fusion glycoprotein. These results put forth that novel phosphorylated ABC‐1 protects chickens from NDV‐induced pathogenesis, protein oxidation/nitration, and exerts potent antiviral activity.","Suresh, K.

The purpose of this study was to conduct a national assessment of the views of Americans on the change in firearm sales, the perceived impact of the changes in sales, and how these perceptions differ by a recent purchase of a firearm. METHODS: A multi‐item valid and reliable questionnaire was deployed online via mTurk and social media sites in the last week of May 2020 to recruit adult Americans in the general population across the United States. RESULTS: Among the total sample of study participants (n = 1432), almost a fifth (18%, n = 263) reported buying a firearm during the pandemic. Firearm buyers differed statistically significantly (P < 0.01) from non‐buyers based on sex, age, ethnicity, marital status, education, having children at home, employment status, income, political orientation, location, and region of residence in the United States. Those who did not buy firearms during the pandemic were significantly (P < 0.01) more likely to believe that firearm sales and first‐time ownership/buying of firearms had increased during the pandemic. Similarly, those who did not buy a firearm during the pandemic were significantly more likely to believe that the surge in firearm sales would result in increased firearm access for children, mentally ill, drug users, criminals, and older adults. In relation to perceived changes in selected public health outcomes attributed to the surge in firearm sales, firearm buyers were significantly less likely (P < 0.01) to believe that an increase in sales could result in adverse public health outcomes such as a higher number of suicides, homicides, mass shootings, and crimes in society. In multiple regression analyses, significant predictors of pandemic purchase of firearms were: having children at home, owning firearms before the pandemic, planning to buy firearms in the next year, knowing someone who was shot or killed with a firearm, and personally experiencing firearm violence in the past (ie, threatened or shot with a firearm). CONCLUSIONS: This study delineated the characteristics of those who purchased a firearm during the pandemic and the reasons for such purchases during the COVID‐19 pandemic.

Linguistic analysis and clinical evaluation were conducted to explore the group’s collective elaboration of a shared traumatic experience. Sixty-eight people (22 males; mean age 26.16 ds. 7.68) contributed to a social-blog, writing their dreams. 91 dreams were collected and transcribed using transcription rules for the Discourse Attributes Analysis Program (DAAP). Linguistic measures of RP were applied and a statistical cluster analysis was performed. In addition, each dream was evaluated by trained judges on three specific qualities of the RP (Arousal, Symbolizing, and Reflection/Reorganizing). Clinical judges in a double-blinded method reached reliable scoring (Arousal α.874 ICC 0.701; Symbolizing α.783 ICC 0.671; Reflection/reorganization α.884 ICC 0.758).

We examined the association between COVID-19 at delivery and adverse pregnancy outcomes, maternal complications, and severe illness, whether these associations differ by race/ethnicity; and described discharge status by COVID-19 diagnosis and maternal complications. METHODS: Data from 703 hospitals in the Premier Healthcare Database during March–September 2020 were included. Adjusted risk ratios overall and stratified by race/ethnicity were estimated using Poisson regression with robust standard errors. Proportion not discharged home was calculated by maternal complications, stratified by COVID-19 diagnosis. RESULTS: Among 489,471 delivery hospitalizations, 6,550 (1.3%) had a COVID-19 diagnosis. In adjusted models, COVID-19 was associated with increased risk for: acute respiratory distress syndrome (adjusted risk ratio [aRR] = 34.4), death (aRR = 17.0), sepsis (aRR = 13.6), mechanical ventilation (aRR = 12.7), shock (aRR = 5.1), intensive care unit admission (aRR = 3.6), acute renal failure (aRR = 3.5), thromboembolic disease (aRR = 2.7), adverse cardiac event/outcome (aRR = 2.2) and preterm labor with preterm delivery (aRR = 1.2). Risk for any maternal complications or for any severe illness did not significantly differ by race/ethnicity. Discharge status did not differ by COVID-19; however, among women with concurrent maternal complications, a greater proportion of those with (versus without) COVID-19 were not discharged home.

Surprisingly, microarray based identification of food-borne viruses, one of the largest groups of pathogenic viruses, causing more than 1.5 billion infections world-wide every year, has lagged behind. Cell-culture techniques are either unavailable or time consuming for routine application. Consequently, current detection methods for these pathogens largely depend on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based techniques, generally requiring an investigator to preselect the target virus of interest. Here we describe the first attempt to use the microarray as an identification tool for these viruses.

However, there is a lack of a universal analytical framework to extract, quantify, and compare content features in public discourse of emerging health issues on different social media platforms across a broad sociocultural spectrum. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to develop a novel and universal content feature extraction and analytical framework and contrast how content features differ with sociocultural background in discussions of the emerging COVID-19 global health crisis on major social media platforms. METHODS: We sampled the 1000 most shared viral Twitter and Sina Weibo posts regarding COVID-19, developed a comprehensive coding scheme to identify 77 potential features across six major categories (eg, clinical and epidemiological, countermeasures, politics and policy, responses), quantified feature values (0 or 1, indicating whether or not the content feature is mentioned in the post) in each viral post across social media platforms, and performed subsequent comparative analyses. Machine learning dimension reduction and clustering analysis were then applied to harness the power of social media data and provide more unbiased characterization of web-based health communications. RESULTS: There were substantially different distributions, prevalence, and associations of content features in public discourse about the COVID-19 pandemic on the two social media platforms. Weibo users were more likely to focus on the disease itself and health aspects, while Twitter users engaged more about policy, politics, and other societal issues. CONCLUSIONS: We extracted a rich set of content features from social media data to accurately characterize public discourse related to COVID-19 in different sociocultural backgrounds. In addition, this universal framework can be adopted to analyze social media discussions of other emerging health issues beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Shi; Zhou, Lina; Song, Yunya; Xu, Qian; Wang, Ping; Wang, Kanlun; Ge, Yaorong; Janies, Daniel",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/24889; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33326408/,446

And does it matter?,2020-11-25,"The biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) requirement to culture severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a bottleneck for research and countermeasure development. Here we report a trans-complementation system that produces single-round infectious SARS-CoV-2 that recapitulates authentic viral replication. We demonstrate that the single-round infectious SARS-CoV-2 can be used at BSL-2 laboratories for high-throughput neutralization and antiviral testing. The trans-complementation system consists of two components: a genomic viral RNA containing a deletion of ORF3 and envelope gene, and a producer cell line expressing the two deleted genes. Trans-complementation of the two components generates virions that can infect naive cells for only one round, but does not produce wild-type SARS-CoV-2. Hamsters and K18-hACE2 transgenic mice inoculated with the complementation-derived virions exhibited no detectable disease, even after intracranial inoculation with the highest possible dose. The results suggest that the trans-complementation platform can be safely used at BSL-2 laboratories for research and countermeasure development.","Zhang, Xianwen; Liu, Yang; Liu, Jianying; Bailey, Adam L.; Plante, Kenneth S.; Plante, Jessica A.; Zou, Jing; Xia, Hongjie; Bopp, Nathen; Aguilar, Patricia; Ren, Ping; Menachery, Vineet D.; Diamond, Michael S.; Weaver, Scott C.; Xie, Xuping; Shi, Pei-Yong",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33501436/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.16.426970,446
593575,The burden of thrombotic complications in critically ill patients with COVID-19: charting the uncharted,2020-06-05,"Researchers and journalists have argued that work-related factors may be partly responsible for disproportionate COVID-19 infection and death rates among vulnerable groups. We evaluate these issues by describing racial and ethnic differences in the likelihood of work-related exposure to COVID-19. We extend previous studies by considering 12 racial and ethnic groups and five types of potential occupational exposure to the virus: exposure to infection, physical proximity to others, face-to-face discussions, interactions with external customers and the public, and working indoors. Most importantly, we stratify our results by occupational standing, defined as the proportion of workers within each occupation with at least some college education. This measure serves as a proxy for whether workplaces and workers employ COVID-19-related risk reduction strategies. We use the 2018 American Community Survey to identify recent workers by occupation, and link 409 occupations to information on work context from the Occupational Information Network to identify potential COVID-related risk factors. We then examine the racial/ethnic distribution of all frontline workers and frontline workers at highest potential risk of COVID-19, by occupational standing and by sex. The results indicate that, contrary to expectation, White frontline workers are often overrepresented in high-risk jobs while Black and Latino frontline workers are generally underrepresented in these jobs. However, disaggregation of the results by occupational standing shows that, in contrast to Whites and several Asian groups, Latino and Black frontline workers are overrepresented in lower standing occupations overall and in lower standing occupations associated with high risk, and thus may be less likely to have adequate COVID-19 protections. Our findings suggest that greater work exposures likely contribute to a higher prevalence of COVID-19 among Latino and Black adults and underscore the need for measures to reduce potential exposure for workers in low standing occupations and for the development of programs outside the workplace.","Goldman, Noreen; Pebley, Anne R.; Lee, Keunbok; Andrasfay, Theresa; Pratt, Boriana",PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0256085; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34469440/,446

METHODS: A total of 115 children aged 8–17 years with a diagnosis of myopia who had been followed-up for at least three years, were included in this study with a retrospective and single-centre design. The subjects’ age, the history of myopia in the family, the time spent in front of a screen, the digital devices used during home education (computer, tablet, smartphone, television), the time spent in open air (hours/day), the refractive error (RE) (spherical equivalent value) detected before the home education period and the changes in the myopia over the years, were recorded. RESULTS: The mean age was 12.06 (±2.29) years. Only the right eyes were included. The glasses use duration was 3.57 (±0.74) years. The annual MP amount 0.49 (±0.26), 0.41 (±0.36) and 0.54 (±0.43) dioptres (D) for the 2017, 2018 and 2019 years before home education, respectively, (p > 0.05), and 0.71 (±0.46) D in 2020, during home education. The increase in MP amount in 2020 compared to the 2019 and 2018 years was statistically significant (p < 0.003). MP was statistically significantly less in children who participated in open-air activities for 2 h a day and those who lived in detached houses (p = 0.004, p = 0.006, respectively). CONCLUSION: During home confinement, education programmes of school children should be designed while taking into account preventive measures for MP, in particular for allowing children to spend at least 2 h of outdoor time per day.","Aslan, Fatih; Sahinoglu-Keskek, Nedime",Eye (Lond),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34193982/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41433-021-01655-2,446
598351,FULMINANT MYOCARDITIS IN COVID-19 WITH RAPID RECOVERY OF SYSTOLIC FUNCTION,2021-05-11,"INTRODUCTION: Risk stratification is an important aspect of COVID-19 management, especially in patients admitted to ICU as it can provide more useful consumption of health resources, as well as prioritize critical care services in situations of overwhelming number of patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A multivariable predictive model for mortality was developed using data solely from a derivation cohort of 160 COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe ARDS admitted to ICU. The regression coefficients from the final multivariate model of the derivation study were used to assign points for the risk model, consisted of all significant variables from the multivariate analysis and age as a known risk factor for COVID-19 patient mortality. The newly developed AIDA score was arrived at by assigning 5 points for serum albumin and 1 point for IL-6, D dimer, and age. The score was further validated on a cohort of 304 patients admitted to ICU due to the severe form of COVID-19. RESULTS: The study population included 160 COVID-19 patients admitted to ICU in the derivation and 304 in the validation cohort. The mean patient age was 66.7 years (range, 20–93 years), with 68.1% men and 31.9% women. Most patients (76.8%) had comorbidities with hypertension (67.7%), diabetes (31.7), and coronary artery disease (19.3) as the most frequent. A total of 316 patients (68.3%) were treated with mechanical ventilation. Ninety-six (60.0%) in the derivation cohort and 221 (72.7%) patients in the validation cohort had a lethal outcome. The population was divided into the following risk categories for mortality based on the risk model score: low risk (score 0–1) and at-risk (score > 1). In addition, patients were considered at high risk with a risk score > 2. By applying the risk model to the validation cohort (n = 304), the positive predictive value was 78.8% (95% CI 75.5% to 81.8%); the negative predictive value was 46.6% (95% CI 37.3% to 56.2%); the sensitivity was 82.4% (95% CI 76.7% to 87.1%), and the specificity was 41.0% (95% CI 30.3% to 52.3%). The C statistic was 0.863 (95% CI 0.805-0.921) and 0.665 (95% CI 0.598-0.732) in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively, indicating a high discriminative value of the proposed score. CONCLUSION: In the present study, AIDA score showed a valuable significance in estimating the mortality risk in patients with the severe form of COVID-19 disease at admission to ICU. Further external validation on a larger group of patients is needed to provide more insights into the utility of this score in everyday practice.","Zdravkovic, Marija; Popadic, Viseslav; Klasnja, Slobodan; Pavlovic, Vedrana; Aleksic, Aleksandra; Milenkovic, Marija; Crnokrak, Bogdan; Balint, Bela; Todorovic-Balint, Milena; Mrda, Davor; Zdravkovic, Darko; Toskovic, Borislav; Brankovic, Marija; Markovic, Olivera; Bjekic-Macut, Jelica; Djuran, Predrag; Memon, Lidija; Stojanovic, Ana; Brajkovic, Milica; Todorovic, Zoran; Hadzi-Djokic, Jovan; Jovanovic, Igor; Nikolic, Dejan; Cvijanovic, Dane; Milic, Natasa",Oxid Med Cell Longev,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34257816/; https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6654388,446

METHODS We studied residents living in LTC homes in Ontario, Canada, who underwent PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection from January 1 to August 31, 2020, and examined predictors of all-cause death within 30 days after a positive test for SARS-CoV-2. We examined a broad range of risk factor categories including demographics, comorbidities, functional status, laboratory tests, and characteristics of the LTC facility and surrounding community were examined. In total, 304 potential predictors were evaluated for their association with mortality using machine learning (Random Forest). RESULTS A total of 64,733 residents of LTC, median age 86 (78, 91) years (31.8% men), underwent SARS-CoV-2 testing, of whom 5029 (7.8%) tested positive. Thirty-day mortality rates were 28.7% (1442 deaths) after a positive test. Of 59,702 residents who tested negative, 2652 (4.4%) died within 30 days of testing. Predictors of mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection included age, functional status (e.g., activity of daily living score, pressure ulcer risk), male sex, undernutrition, dehydration risk, prior hospital contacts for respiratory illness, and duration of comorbidities (e.g., heart failure, COPD). Lower GFR, hemoglobin concentration, lymphocyte count, and serum albumin were associated with higher mortality. After combining all covariates to generate a risk index, mortality rate in the highest risk quartile was 48.3% compared to 7% in the first quartile (odds ratio 12.42, 95%CI; 6.67, 22.80, p<0.001). Deaths continued to increase rapidly for 15 days after the positive test. CONCLUSIONS LTC residents, particularly those with reduced functional status, comorbidities, and abnormalities on routine laboratory tests, are at high risk for mortality after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Recognizing high-risk residents in LTC may enhance institution of appropriate preventative measures.","Lee, Douglas S; Ma, Shihao; Chu, Anna; Wang, Chloe X; Wang, Xuesong; Austin, Peter C; McAlister, Finlay A; Kalmady Vasu, Sunil; Kapral, Moira K; Kaul, Padma; Ko, Dennis T; Rochon, Paula; Schull, Michael J; Rubin, Barry B; Wang, Bo",Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/jgs.17425; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34409590/,446
599340,Responsiveness of Inhaled Epoprostenol in Respiratory Failure due to COVID-19,2020-11-25,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel infectious disease that is in rapid growth. Several trials are going on worldwide to find a solution for this pandemic. The viral replication can be blocked by inhibiting the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (SARS-CoV-2 RBD Spro) and the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (SARS-CoV-2 Mpro). The binding of potential small molecules to these proteins can inhibit the replication and transcription of the virus. The spice molecules that are used in our food have antiviral, antifungal and antimicrobial properties. As spice molecules are consumed in the diet, hence its antiviral properties against SARS-CoV-2 will benefit in a significant manner. Therefore, in this work, the molecular docking of 30 selected spice molecules (screened through ADME property) was performed to identify the potential inhibitors for the RBD Spro and Mpro of SARS-CoV-2. We have found that though all the molecules bind actively with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD Spro and Mpro, but Piperine has the highest binding affinity among the 30 screened molecules. Besides, the comparative study between Piperine and currently used drugs show that Piperine is more effective. The interaction of Piperine with RBD Spro and Mpro is further validated by the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation studies. The free energy landscape and binding free energy results also, support for the stable complex formation of Piperine with RBD Spro and Mpro. We anticipate immediate wet-lab experiments and clinical trials in support of this computational study that might help to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Thus, in this study, a new strategy was employed in respiratory system disorders by angiogenesis inhibition in an ovalbumin (OVA)-induced rat model of asthma. Twenty-one male Wistar albino rats, 8 weeks old, were randomly divided into three groups (n = 7 in each group), including (1) control group, (2) OVA-treated group, and (3) OVA + Bmab (bevacizumab drug). On days 1 and 8, 1 mg of OVA and aluminum hydroxide in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were intraperitoneally injected to rats in groups 2 and 3. The control group was only subject to intraperitoneal injection of saline on days 1 and 8. One week after the last injection, the rats (groups 2 and 3) were exposed to OVA inhalation for 30 min at 2-day intervals from days 15 to 25. After sensitization and challenge with OVA, the OVA + Bmab group (group 3) were treated with a 5 mg/kg bevacizumab drug. Genes and protein expression of IL-1β and TNF-α and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein were assessed by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry respectively, in lung tissue. OVA exposure increased mucosal secretion and inflammatory cell populations in lung tissue and OVA-specific IgE level in serum. Also, VEGF and cytokine factor expression were significantly elevated in the OVA-induced asthma model (p ≤ 0.05). However, rats in OVA + Bmab group showed significantly a decrease in VEGF and IL-1β and TNF-α genes as well as proteins (p ≤ 0.05). The results showed that bevacizumab efficiently diminished bronchial inflammation via downregulation of VEGF expression, followed by inflammatory cells population and cytokines reduction. Angiogenesis inhibition in rats with induced asthma not only suppresses the inflammatory process through blocking VEGF expression but also inhibits the development of new blood vessels and progressing asthmatic attacks.","Bolandi, Seyed Mohammadreza; Abdolmaleki, Zohreh; Assarehzadegan, Mohammad-Ali",Inflammation,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10753-021-01516-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34420156/,446

STUDY DESIGN: After retrieving 163,433 news records mentioning the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and H1N1 pandemics, a maximum entropy model for inductive machine learning was used to identify relationships among 500 randomly sampled news records that correlated with systematic human assessments of their scientific quality and sensationalism. These relationships were then computationally applied to automatically classify 10,000 additional randomly sampled news records. The model was validated by randomly sampling 200 records and comparing human assessments of them to the computer assessments. RESULTS: The computer model correctly assessed the relevance of 86% of news records, the quality of 65% of records, and the sensationalism of 73% of records, as compared to human assessments. Overall, the scientific quality of SARS and H1N1 news media coverage had potentially important shortcomings, but coverage was not too sensationalizing. Coverage slightly improved between the two pandemics. CONCLUSION: Automated methods can evaluate news records faster, cheaper, and possibly better than humans.

Blood samples were collected from 20 male and female calves via jugular vein catheters every 15 min for 6 hr at Days 3, 9, and 21 of life. The animals were classified into three groups. Group 1 (controls): healthy calves (n = 9). Group 2: calves affected with diarrhea at Day 9 (n = 7). Group 3: calves with diarrhea at Days 3 and 9 (n = 4). Infections occurred spontaneously and were mainly due to E. coli infections. All affected calves had recovered at Day 21. Mean GH concentrations in the calves in Groups 2 and 3 compared to control calves had increased by Day 3 (P < 0.01; P < 0.001). Cortisol levels of calves in all groups were highest at Day 3 and decreased thereafter (P < 0.001). Cortisol concentrations were lower at Day 3 in animals in Groups 2 (P < 0.001) and 3 (P < 0.05) than in controls. Pulsatile LH release was detectable at Days 9 and 21 only in healthy calves. Insulin increased at Day 9 during diarrhea. The results indicate that cortisol concentrations decreased whereas GH concentrations were increased before diarrhea was observed. The onset of pulsatile LH release was delayed in diarrheic calves.

Due to the limited virus strains, few key mutations that would be very important with the evolutionary trends of virus genome were observed in early studies. Here, we downloaded 1809 sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 strains from GISAID before April 2020 to identify mutations and functional alterations caused by these mutations. Totally, we identified 1017 nonsynonymous and 512 synonymous mutations with alignment to reference genome NC_045512, none of which were observed in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. On average, each of the strains could have about 1.75 new mutations each month. The current mutations may have few impacts on antibodies. Although it shows the purifying selection in whole-genome, ORF3a, ORF8 and ORF10 were under positive selection. Only 36 mutations occurred in 1% and more virus strains were further analyzed to reveal linkage disequilibrium (LD) variants and dominant mutations. As a result, we observed five dominant mutations involving three nonsynonymous mutations C28144T, C14408T and A23403G and two synonymous mutations T8782C, and C3037T. These five mutations occurred in almost all strains in April 2020. Besides, we also observed two potential dominant nonsynonymous mutations C1059T and G25563T, which occurred in most of the strains in April 2020. Further functional analysis shows that these mutations decreased protein stability largely, which could lead to a significant reduction of virus virulence. In addition, the A23403G mutation increases the spike-ACE2 interaction and finally leads to the enhancement of its infectivity. All of these proved that the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is toward the enhancement of infectivity and reduction of virulence.","Cheng, Liang; Han, Xudong; Zhu, Zijun; Qi, Changlu; Wang, Ping; Zhang, Xue",Brief Bioinform,https://doi.org/10.1093/bib/bbab042; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33580783/,446

This disease is caused by a single stranded RNA virus belonging to Cronaviridae family. This study aimed to design a potential multi-epitopes vaccine against infectious bronchitis virus spike protein (S). Protein characterization was also performed for IBV spike protein. METHODS: The present study used various tools in Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) to predict conserved B and T cell epitopes against IBV spike (S) protein that may perform a significant role in provoking the resistance response to IBV infection. RESULTS: In B cell prediction methods, three epitopes ((1139)KKSSYY(1144), (1140)KSSYYT(1145), (1141)SSYYT(1145)) were selected as surface, linear and antigenic epitopes. Many MHCI and MHCII epitopes were predicted for IBV S protein. Among them (982)YYITARDMY(990) and (983)YITARDMYM(991) epitopes displayed high antigenicity, no allergenicity and no toxicity as well as great linkage with MHCI and MHCII alleles. Moreover, docking analysis of MHCI epitopes produced strong binding affinity with BF(2) alleles. CONCLUSION: Five conserved epitopes were expected from spike glycoprotein of IBV as the best B and T cell epitopes due to high antigenicity, no allergenicity and no toxicity. In addition, MHC epitopes showed great linkage with MHC alleles as well as strong interaction with BF2 alleles. These epitopes should be designed and incorporated and then tested as multi-epitope vaccine against IBV.","Awadelkareem, Eman A.; Ali, Sumaia A.",Transl Med Commun,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32869000/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s41231-020-00063-0,446
604978,The Effect of Smoking on COVID-19 Symptom Severity: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,2020-09-08,"Ubiquitination is a post-translational modification that regulates cellular processes by altering the interactions of proteins to which ubiquitin, a small protein adduct, is conjugated. Ubiquitination yields various products, including mono- and poly-ubiquitinated substrates, as well as unanchored poly-ubiquitin chains whose accumulation is considered toxic. We previously showed that transgenic, unanchored poly-ubiquitin is not problematic in Drosophila melanogaster. In the fruit fly, free chains exist in various lengths and topologies and are degraded by the proteasome; they are also conjugated onto other proteins as one unit, eliminating them from the free ubiquitin chain pool. Here, to further explore the notion of unanchored chain toxicity, we examined when free poly-ubiquitin might become problematic. We found that unanchored chains can be highly toxic if they resemble linear poly-ubiquitin that cannot be modified into other topologies. These species upregulate NF-κB signaling, and modulation of the levels of NF-κB components reduces toxicity. In additional studies, we show that toxicity from untethered, linear chains is regulated by isoleucine 44, which anchors a key interaction site for ubiquitin. We conclude that free ubiquitin chains can be toxic, but only in uncommon circumstances, such as when the ability of cells to modify and regulate them is markedly restricted.","Blount, Jessica R.; Libohova, Kozeta; Silva, Gustavo M.; Todi, Sokol V.",Cells,https://doi.org/10.3390/cells9061519; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32580388/,446

We provide an extensive evaluation of this fully automated assay on the Cobas e801/e602 immunoassay analysers. METHODS: We assessed the linearity, precision, and throughput of the Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay. Sensitivity was calculated from 349 SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) positive samples; specificity was determined from 715 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-naive samples. We examined cross-reactivity against other antibody positive samples (syphilis, RF, ANA, ds-DNA, influenza, dengue, HBV, HCV) and the anti-SARS-CoV-2 kinetics. RESULTS: The assay cut-off index (COI) was linear up to 90.8. The inter-assay precision was 2.9% for a negative control (COI=0.1) and 5.1% for a positive control (COI=3.0). Assay time is 18min and results are available 1 minute later; throughput for 300 samples was 76 minutes. Only 1 case positive for HBsAg tested falsely positive; specificity was 99.9%. The assay has a sensitivity of 97.1% 14 days after PCR positivity (POS) and 100% at ≥ 21 days POS; 48.2% of cases had anti-SARS-CoV-2 within 6 days POS. In 11 subjects in whom serum was available prior to a positive antibody signal (COI ≥1.0) the interval between the last negative and first positive COI (time to “sero-conversion”) on average is 3 days (range 1-6 days) and 4 more days (range 1-7) for the anti-SARS-CoV-2 to plateau. CONCLUSION: The Roche anti-SARS-CoV-2 assay shows excellent performance with minimal cross-reactivity from other viral and confounding antibodies.

While suburbs are often thought of as areas of uniform affluence and racial homogeneity, over the past 20 years, poverty and diversity have increased substantially in the suburbs. In this study, we compare geographic and temporal trends in COVID-19 cases and deaths in Louisiana, one of the few states with high rates of COVID-19 during both the spring and summer. We find that incidence and mortality rates were initially highest in New Orleans. By the second peak, trends reversed: suburban areas experienced higher rates than New Orleans and similar rates to other urban and rural areas. We also find that increased social vulnerability was associated with increased positivity and incidence during the first peak. During the second peak, these associations reversed in New Orleans while persisting in other urban, suburban, and rural areas. The work draws attention to the high rates of COVID-19 cases and deaths in suburban areas and the importance of metropolitan-wide actions to address COVID-19.","Schnake-Mahl, A.; Bilal, U.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.10.28.20221341v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.28.20221341,446

In the current study, we investigated the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in DI water and primary influent municipal wastewater by sodium hypochlorite (free chlorine) addition. Our results showed rapid disinfection of SARS-CoV-2, with less than 1 mg-min/L required for >3 log10 TCID50 reduction in DI water. More than 5 mg-min/L was required for 3 log10 TCID50 reduction in wastewater, suggesting potential shielding of the virus by solids. These results are consistent with expected virus inactivation by free chlorine and indicates the adequacy of free chlorine disinfection for inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in water matrices.","Greaves, Justin; Fischer, Robert J.; Shaffer, Marlee; Bivins, Aaron; Holbrook, Myndi; Munster, Vincent J.; Bibby, Kyle",Sci Total Environ,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.150766; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969721058447?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34627890/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0048969721058447,446

However, there are concerns regarding the use of ICI in the era of COVID-19. We present currently available information on the pros and cons of using ICI in cancer patients with respect to the risk of acquiring an infection by SARS-CoV2 and mortality from COVID-19. By means of the present paper, clinicians and researchers may update their knowledge on a highly topical clinical question—is the use of ICI in cancer patients with SARS-CoV2 infection harmful with respect to COVID-19 outcome? ABSTRACT: Whether cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are at an increased risk of severe infection and mortality during the corona pandemic is a hotly debated topic that will continue to evolve. Here, we summarize and discuss current studies regarding COVID-19 and anti-cancer treatment with an emphasis on ICI. Importantly, several lines of evidence suggest that patients currently treated with ICI do not display an increased vulnerability to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Data regarding morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 in cancer patients receiving ICI are less clear and often conflicting. Although mostly based on experimental data, it is possible that ICI can promote the exacerbated immune response associated with adverse outcome in COVID-19 patients. On the other hand, mounting evidence suggests that ICI might even be useful in the treatment of viral infections by preventing or ameliorating T cell exhaustion. In this context, the right timing of treatment might be essential. Nevertheless, some cancer patients treated with ICI experience autoimmune-related side effects that require the use of immunosuppressive therapies, which in turn may promote a severe course of infection with SARS-CoV-2. Although there is clear evidence that withholding ICI will have more serious consequences, further studies are urgently needed in to better evaluate the effects of ICI in patients with COVID-19 and the use of ICI during the corona pandemic in general.","Gambichler, Thilo; Reuther, Judith; Scheel, Christina H.; Susok, Laura; Kern, Peter; Becker, Jürgen C.",Cancers (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers12113383; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33207589/,446

617715,Lower mortality of COVID-19 by early recognition and intervention: experience from Jiangsu Province,2020-03-18,"The purpose of a forecast, in making an estimate about the future, is to give people information to act on. In the case of a coupled human system, a change in human behavior caused by the forecast can alter the course of events that were the subject of the forecast. In this context, the forecast is an integral part of the coupled human system, with two-way feedback between forecast output and human behavior. However, forecasting programs generally do not examine how the forecast might affect the system in question. This study examines how such a coupled system works using a model of viral infection—the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model—when the model is used in a forecasting context. Human behavior is modified by making the contact rate responsive to other dynamics, including forecasts, of the SIR system. This modification creates two-way feedback between the forecast and the infection dynamics. Results show that a faster rate of response by a population to system dynamics or forecasts leads to a significant decline in peak infections. Responding to a forecast leads to a lower infection peak than responding to current infection levels. Inaccurate forecasts can lead to either higher or lower peak infections depending on whether the forecast under-or over-estimates the peak. The direction of inaccuracy in a forecast determines whether the outcome is better or worse for the population. While work is still needed to constrain model functional forms, forecast feedback can be an important component of epidemic dynamics that should be considered in response planning.","Record, Nicholas R.; Pershing, Andrew",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.9649; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32844061/,446

Multiple innate immune pathways are likely dysregulated in the salivary gland epithelium in pSS, including the nuclear factor-κB pathway, the inflammasome and interferon signalling. The ductal cells of the salivary gland in pSS are characteristically surrounded by a CD4(+) T cell-rich and B cell-rich infiltrate, implying a degree of communication between epithelial cells and immune cells. B cell infiltrates within the ducts can initiate the development of lymphoepithelial lesions, including basal ductal cell hyperplasia. Vice versa, the epithelium provides chronic activation signals to the glandular B cell fraction. This continuous stimulation might ultimately drive the development of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. This Review discusses changes in the cells of the salivary gland epithelium in pSS (including acinar, ductal and progenitor cells), and the proposed interplay of these cells with environmental stimuli and the immune system. Current therapeutic options are insufficient to address both lymphocytic infiltration and salivary gland dysfunction. Successful rescue of salivary gland function in pSS will probably demand a multimodal therapeutic approach and an appreciation of the complicity of the salivary gland epithelium in the development of pSS.","Verstappen, Gwenny M.; Pringle, Sarah; Bootsma, Hendrika; Kroese, Frans G.

DESIGN: Cross‐sectional analysis of national nursing home COVID‐19 reports linked to other data. Multivariable two‐part models modeled disparities in count of cases or deaths, and logistic regressions modeled disparities in self‐reported shortages in staff and personal protective equipment (PPE), across nursing home groups with varying proportions of racial/ethnic minority residents, defined as low‐, medium‐, medium‐high–, and high‐proportion groups. SETTING: A total of 12,576 nursing homes nationally. PARTICIPANTS: None. INTERVENTION: None. MEASUREMENTS: Numbers of incident COVID‐19 confirmed cases among residents and staff, and incident COVID‐19 related deaths among residents (primary outcomes); and nursing home reported shortages in staff and PPE (secondary outcomes). All outcomes were reported for the week of May 25, 2020. RESULTS: The number of weekly new COVID‐19 confirmed cases among residents ranged from an average of 0.4 cases per facility (standard deviation (SD) = 2.5) for the low‐proportion group (93.0% had zero new cases) to 1.5 cases per facility (SD = 6.3) for the high‐proportion group (78.9% had zero new cases). Multivariable regression estimated that compared with the low‐proportion group, the likelihood of having at least one new resident case was 76% higher (odds ratio = 1.76; 95% confidence interval = 1.38–2.25; P = .000) for the high‐proportion group.

However, some face-to-face contact remained necessary and practices needed to ensure such contact could continue safely. AIM: To examine how practices determined when face-to-face contact was necessary and how face-to-face consultations were reconfigured to reduce COVID-19 infection risk. DESIGN & SETTING: Qualitative interview study in general practices in Bristol, North Somerset, and South Gloucestershire. METHOD: Longitudinal semi-structured interviews with clinical and managerial practice staff were undertaken at four timepoints between May and July 2020. RESULTS: Practices worked flexibly within general national guidance to determine when face-to-face contact with patients was necessary, influenced by knowledge of the patient, experience, and practice resilience. For example, practices prioritised patients according to clinical need using face-to-face contact to resolve clinician uncertainty or provide adequate reassurance to patients. To make face-to-face contact as safe as possible and keep patients separated, practices introduced a heterogeneous range of measures that exploited features of their indoor and outdoor spaces, and altered their appointment processes. As national restrictions eased in June and July, the number and proportion of patients seen face to face generally increased. However, the reconfiguration of buildings and processes reduced the available capacity and put increased pressure on practices. CONCLUSION: Practices responded rapidly and creatively to the initial lockdown restrictions. The variety of ways practices organised face-to-face contact to minimise infection highlights the need for flexibility in guidance.","Turner, Andrew; Scott, Anne; Horwood, Jeremy; Salisbury, Chris; Denholm, Rachel; Scott, Lauren; Iyer, Geeta; Macleod, John; Murphy, Mairead",BJGP open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34257067/; https://doi.org/10.3399/bjgpo.2021.0036,446

Here, we use existing MERS-CoV sequence data to explore its phylodynamics in two of its known major hosts, humans and camels. We employ structured coalescent models to show that long-term MERS-CoV evolution occurs exclusively in camels, whereas humans act as a transient, and ultimately terminal host. By analysing the distribution of human outbreak cluster sizes and zoonotic introduction times, we show that human outbreaks in the Arabian peninsula are driven by seasonally varying zoonotic transfer of viruses from camels.

SARS-CoV-2-inactivation activity was evaluated in a virus solution containing 1%, 20% or 40% fetal bovine serum (FBS) with OW, SAEW or EtOH at a virus-to-test solution ratio of 1:9, 1:19 or 1:99 for a reaction time of 20 s. EtOH showed the strongest virucidal activity, followed by SAEW and OW. Even though EtOH potently inactivated the virus despite the 40% FBS concentration, virus inactivation by OW and SAEW decreased in proportion to the increase in FBS concentration. Nevertheless, OW and SAEW showed potent virucidal activity with 40% FBS at a virus-to-test solution ratio of 1:99. Real-time PCR targeting the viral genome revealed that cycle threshold values in the OW and SAEW groups were significantly higher than those in the control group, suggesting that OW and SAEW disrupted the viral genome. Western blotting analysis targeting the recombinant viral spike protein S1 subunit showed a change in the specific band into a ladder upon treatment with OW and SAEW. OW and SAEW may cause conformational changes in the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.","Takeda, Yohei; Jamsransuren, Dulamjav; Makita, Yoshimasa; Kaneko, Akihiro; Matsuda, Sachiko; Ogawa, Haruko; Oh, Hourei",Molecules,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34576934/; https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules26185465,446

We detect auto-Abs neutralizing 100-fold lower, more physiological, concentrations of IFN-α and/or -ω (100 pg/mL, in 1/10 dilutions of plasma) in 13.6% of 3,595 patients with critical COVID-19, including 21% of 374 patients > 80 years, and 6.5% of 522 patients with severe COVID-19. These antibodies are also detected in 18% of the 1,124 deceased patients (aged 20 days-99 years; mean: 70 years). Moreover, another 1.3% of patients with critical COVID-19 and 0.9% of the deceased patients have auto-Abs neutralizing high concentrations of IFN-ß. We also show, in a sample of 34,159 uninfected subjects from the general population, that auto-Abs neutralizing high concentrations of IFN-α and/or -ω are present in 0.18% of individuals between 18 and 69 years, 1.1% between 70 and 79 years, and 3.4% >80 years. Moreover, the proportion of subjects carrying auto-Abs neutralizing lower concentrations is greater in a subsample of 10,778 uninfected individuals: 1% of individuals <70 years, 2.3% between 70 and 80 years, and 6.3% >80 years. By contrast, auto-Abs neutralizing IFN-ß do not become more frequent with age. Auto-Abs neutralizing type I IFNs predate SARS-CoV-2 infection and sharply increase in prevalence after the age of 70 years.

A sample of 414 individuals between the ages of 18 and 81 were asked to rate the intensity of the shock, sadness, anger, and fear they experienced due to COVID-19 and respond to items from the Brief Cope questionnaire. The present findings demonstrate that anger was consistently less intense among older adults than younger ones. Emotion-focused coping strategies were more commonly used by younger adults than middle-aged or older ones at the first peak of the outbreak; however, this trend had reversed during the second peak of the pandemic, as the older age groups demonstrated a far greater increase in the use of this form of coping. Results indicate a greater ability to use emotional regulation among older adults than younger ones, as the former are less likely to react to a crisis through anger and more able to adapt coping mechanisms to a dynamic environment.","Malesza, M.",,http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2021.03.21.21254050v1?rss=1; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.21.21254050,446

With the increasing incidence of COVID-19 pneumonia, its influence on pregnant women and neonates has attracted more attention. In this review, we collected all relevant articles published in English from September 1, 2019 to June 10, 2021, regarding the epidemiology, clinical presentations, chemical examinations, imaging findings, the timing of delivery and delivery mode, maternal and neonatal complications, medication, and vertical transmission of COVID-19 in pregnancy. It has been reported that compared with non-pregnant females, pregnant women with COVID-19 are more likely to develop into severe type. In particular, the risk of entering the intensive care unit and endotracheal intubation was higher. Chest computed tomography and blood routine examination are useful for the diagnosis of COVID-19 in a short period of time. COVID-19 pneumonia is not an independent indication for terminating the pregnancy, and it is not contraindicated for vaginal delivery. Compared to normal pregnant females, patients with COVID-19 showed an elevated susceptibility of preterm delivery. Multidisciplinary consultation was suggested in the treatment policy of COVID-19 in pregnancy. Currently, there is no evaluation on the safety, efficacy, and immunity of the approved vaccines for mothers and infants. In human placental tissues, the COVID-19 virus has been found by different detection methods. The mechanism by which the virus enters the placental tissue is unclear, which may be related to placental inflammation.

Like SARS-CoV, ACE2 as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV2 is essential for virus to entry to the cell. ACE2 is a part of RAS which is expressed in several organs that opposes the AngII functions by converting Ang II to Ang (1-7), the one with vasodilation effects. The death rate of COVID-19 is estimated about 3.4%, however, some comorbid conditions like underlying cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes increase the risk of mortality. In addition, cardiovascular involvement by SARS-CoV2 could be direct through either ACE2 receptors which are expressed tremendously in heart, or by the surge of different cytokines or by ARDS-induced hypoxia. Traditional risk factors could aggravate the process of COVID-19 infection that urges the triage of these high risk patients for SARS-CoV2. Currently, there is no effective, proven treatment or vaccination for COVID-19, but many investigators are struggling to find a treatment strategy as soon as possible. Some potential medications like chloroquine by itself or in combination with azithromycin, and some protease inhibitors used for the treatment of COVID-19 have cardiovascular adverse effects that should be kept in mind in order to close monitor of the patients receiving these medications.","Amirfakhryan, Hamideh; safari, Fatemeh",Hellenic J Cardiol,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1109966620300968?v=s5; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1109966620300968; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hjc.2020.05.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32522617/,446

A scoping review of the literature with compiled recommendations is a useful tool for arthroplasty surgeons as they resume their orthopedic practices during the pandemic. METHODS: In June 2020, PubMed, Embase (Ovid), Cochrane Library (Wiley), Scopus, LitCovid, CINAHL, medRxiv, and bioRxiv were queried for articles using controlled vocabulary and keywords pertaining to COVID-19 and total joint arthroplasty. Studies were characterized by their region of origin, design, and CEBM level of evidence. The identified relevant studies were grouped into six categories: changes to future clinical workflow, education, impact on patients, impact on surgeons, technology, and surgical volume. RESULTS: The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on arthroplasty practice, including the disruption of the clinical teaching environment, personal and financial consequences for patients and physicians, and the drastic reduction in surgical volume. New pathways for clinical workflow have emerged, along with novel technologies with applications for both patients and trainees. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic emphasizes the recent trend in arthroplasty toward risk stratification and outpatient surgery, which may result in improved clinical outcomes and significant cost-savings.

This multicenter study examined the changes in waiting times of elective surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic in Finland. METHODS: Data on elective surgery were gathered from three Finnish public hospitals for years 2017–2020. Surgery incidence and waiting times were examined and the year 2020 was compared to the reference years 2017–2019. The mean annual, monthly, and weekly waiting times were calculated with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The most common diagnosis groups were examined separately. FINDINGS: A total of 88 693 surgeries were included during the study period. The mean waiting time in 2020 was 92.6 (CI 91.5–93.8) days, whereas the mean waiting time in the reference years was 85.8 (CI 85.1–86.5) days, resulting in an average 8% increase in waiting times in 2020. Elective procedure incidence decreased rapidly in the onset of the first COVID-19 wave in March 2020 but recovered in May and June, after which the surgery incidence was 22% higher than in the reference years and remained at this level until the end of the year. In May 2020 and thereafter until November, waiting times were longer with monthly increases varying between 7% and 34%. In gastrointestinal and genitourinary diseases and neoplasms, waiting times were longer in 2020. In cardiovascular and musculoskeletal diseases, waiting times were shorter in 2020. CONCLUSION: The health care reorganizations due to the pandemic have increased elective surgery waiting times by as much as one-third, even though the elective surgery rate increased by one-fifth after the lockdown.","Uimonen, Mikko; Kuitunen, Ilari; Paloneva, Juha; Launonen, Antti P.; Ponkilainen, Ville; Mattila, Ville M.",PLoS One,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34228727/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0253875,446

Specifically, it is likely to elicit an intense response to fear and to act as a risk factor for the onset of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Some individuals may be more at risk than others, with pathological personality variables being a potential candidate as a central vulnerability factor. In addition, the pathways that lead the pathological personality to PTSD and intense fear responses to COVID-19 are likely to be explained by poor emotion regulation capacities, as well as by dissociative mechanisms. Aims: This study aimed to shed light on vulnerability factors that may account for the onset of PTSD and intense responses of fear in response to COVID-19 outbreak and to test the mediating role of emotion dysregulation and dissociation proneness in these pathways. Methods: We used a longitudinal design of research administered to a sample of community individuals (N = 308; mean(age) = 35.31, SD = 13.91; 22.7% were male). Moreover, we used self-report questionnaires to measure pathological personality, emotion regulation capacities, dissociative proneness at the beginning of the lockdown, and PTSD symptoms and fear of COVID-19 at the end of the Italian lockdown (from March 9 to May 18, 2020). Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypotheses. Results: We found that pathological personality levels longitudinally predicted PTSD and fear of COVID-19 levels. Moreover, the associations between emotion dysregulation and dissociation were shown to significantly and totally mediate the relationship between pathological personality and PTSD, whereas no significant mediation effects were observed in relation to fear of COVID-19. Conclusions: Individuals with pathological personality traits may be more vulnerable to the onset of negative psychological consequences related to COVID-19 outbreak, such as PTSD symptomatology and fear levels. Emotion regulation capacities appear to be relevant targets of interventions for PTSD symptomatology. Future research should explore the mediating variables linking pathological personality to intense fear responses to COVID-19.","Velotti, Patrizia; Civilla, Claudia; Rogier, Guyonne; Beomonte Zobel, Sara",Front Psychiatry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33833698/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.590021,446

639229,COVID-19 crisis in Paris: a differential psychological impact between ICU regular staff and reinforcement,2020-11-27,"Interindividual variability in susceptibility to HIV‐1 infection, its transmission, disease progression, and response to antiviral therapy has been attributed to host determinants and variability in multiple genes. Although most people exposed to the virus go on to develop full‐blown disease at variable intervals, a proportion of them, labeled as long‐term nonprogressors or exposed uninfected, possess ‘natural resistance’ to infection. A better understanding of genetic and immunologic basis of such a natural resistance to infection would bear important implications in designing therapeutic vaccine designs. The genetic variants that could influence susceptibility to HIV‐1 and limit AIDS vary in different populations and among individuals. Meta‐analyses of large cohort studies have identified numerous ‘AIDS restriction genes’ that regulate HIV cell entry (particularly chemokine coreceptors and their ligands), acquired and innate immunity (major histocompatibility complex, killer cell immunoglobulin‐like receptor, and cytokines), and others [tripartite interaction motif 5 α (TRIM5α) and apolipoprotein B mRNA‐editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide‐like 3G] that influence outcome of HIV infection. Studies carried out in the Indian population with regard to genetic polymorphisms in chemokine receptors have shown that (i) the protective CCR5 Δ32 variant is rare, (ii) CCR5HHE carrying *59402A is associated with increased likelihood of infection and development of AIDS, and (iii) the Indian population generally has low CCL3L1 copy numbers (∼2.3).

639643,Regional differences in hospital admissions for ST-elevation and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarctions during the Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic in Austria,2020-06-12,"Background: Laboratory diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection (the cause of COVID-19) uses PCR to detect viral RNA (vRNA) in respiratory samples. SARS-CoV-2 RNA has also been detected in other sample types, but there is limited understanding of the clinical or laboratory significance of its detection in blood. Methods: We undertook a systematic literature review to assimilate the evidence for the frequency of vRNA in blood, and to identify associated clinical characteristics. We performed RT-PCR in serum samples from a UK clinical cohort of acute and convalescent COVID-19 cases (n=212), together with convalescent plasma samples collected by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) (n=212 additional samples). To determine whether PCR-positive blood samples could pose an infection risk, we attempted virus isolation from a subset of RNA-positive samples. Results: We identified 28 relevant studies, reporting SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 0-76% of blood samples; pooled estimate 10% (95%CI 5-18%). Among serum samples from our clinical cohort, 27/212 (12.7%) had SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by RT-PCR. RNA detection occurred in samples up to day 20 post symptom onset, and was associated with more severe disease (multivariable odds ratio 7.5). Across clinical and convalescent samples collected [≥]28 days post symptom onset, 0/244 (0%, 95%CI 0.0-1.5%) had vRNA detected. Among our PCR-positive samples, cycle threshold (ct) values were high (range 33.5-44.8), suggesting low vRNA copy numbers. PCR-positive sera inoculated into cell culture did not produce any cytopathic effect or yield an increase in detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Conclusions: vRNA was detectable at low viral loads in a minority of serum samples collected in acute infection, but was not associated with infectious SARS-CoV-2 (within the limitations of the assays used). This work helps to inform biosafety precautions for handling blood products from patients with current or previous COVID-19.","Andersson, M.; Arancibia - Carcamo, C. V.; Auckland, K.; Baillie, J.

640314,Prevalence of Chemosensory Dysfunction in COVID-19 Patients: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Reveals Significant Ethnic Differences,2020-06-17,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV)-2 (SARS-CoV-2), previously called 2019 novel CoV, emerged from China in late December 2019. This virus causes CoV disease-19 (COVID-19), which has been proven a global pandemic leading to a major outbreak. As of June 19, 2020, the data from the World Health Organization (WHO) showed more than 8.7 million confirmed cases in over 200 countries/regions. The WHO has declared COVID-19 as the sixth public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020. CoVs cause illnesses that range in severity from the common cold to severe respiratory illnesses and death. Nevertheless, with technological advances and imperative lessons gained from prior outbreaks, humankind is better outfitted to deal with the latest emerging group of CoVs. Studies on the development of in vitro diagnostic tests, vaccines, and drug re-purposing are being carried out in this field. Currently, no approved treatment is available for SARS-CoV-2 given the lack of evidence. The results from preliminary clinical trials have been mixed as far as improvement in the clinical condition and reduction in the duration of treatment are concerned. A number of new clinical trials are currently in progress to test the efficacy and safety of various approved drugs. This review focuses on recent advancements in the field of development of diagnostic tests, vaccines, and treatment approaches for COVID-19.","Ahsan, Waquar; Alhazmi, Hassan A.; Patel, Kuldeep Singh; Mangla, Bharti; Al Bratty, Mohammed; Javed, Shamama; Najmi, Asim; Sultan, Muhammad Hadi; Makeen, Hafiz A.; Khalid, Asaad; Mohan, Syam; Taha, Manal M.

640423,An internally validated prediction model for critical COVID-19 infection and intensive care unit admission in symptomatic pregnant women,2021-09-25,"BACKGROUND: Daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) is vital to the physical, mental, and social well-being of children. Early restrictions during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic included the closure of schools and physical activity (PA) amenities across the US. This study aimed to examine the impact of the pandemic on the PA and play behavior of U.S. children and to provide evidence-based recommendations to improve their PA. METHODS: A cross-sectional, online, parent-reported survey was conducted of children aged 3–18 years between April and June 2020 to assess light PA and MVPA using a modified Godin Leisure-Time Exercise Questionnaire. Additional items included family/child socioeconomic demographics, child adaptability to the pandemic, and community access. The survey was shared through social media and snowball sampling distribution. RESULTS: Analysis of 1310 surveys indicated child PA scores declined significantly during the pandemic (from 56.6 to 44.6, max 119, p < 0.001). Specifically, MVPA score decreased (from 46.7 to 34.7, max 98, p < 0.001) while light PA remained the same. Age-based changes were seen in the quantity, variety, and intensity of PA, with the lowest pandemic-related impact seen in preschoolers and the highest in high schoolers (–4.7 vs. –17.2, p < 0.001). Community-based peer PA decreased across all age groups. CONCLUSION: This study shows decreased PA levels in U.S. children, according to parent reporting, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recommendations for community leaders, educators, and parents to improve PA in children are provided. With continued spread of COVID-19, these results and recommendations may be imperative to the physical well-being of U.S. children.","Tulchin-Francis, Kirsten; Stevens, Wilshaw; Gu, Xiangli; Zhang, Tao; Roberts, Heather; Keller, Jean; Dempsey, Dana; Borchard, Justine; Jeans, Kelly; VanPelt, Jonathan",J Sport Health Sci,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jshs.2021.02.005; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33657464/,446

Pharmacological modulation of metabolism-dependent cellular pathways such as autophagy reduced propagation of highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 infection limits autophagy by interfering with multiple metabolic pathways and that compound-driven interventions aimed at autophagy induction reduce SARS-CoV-2 propagation in vitro. In-depth analyses of autophagy signaling and metabolomics indicate that SARS-CoV-2 reduces glycolysis and protein translation by limiting activation of AMP-protein activated kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1). Infection also downregulates autophagy-inducing spermidine, and facilitates AKT1/SKP2-dependent degradation of autophagy-initiating Beclin-1 (BECN1). Targeting of these pathways by exogenous administration of spermidine, AKT inhibitor MK-2206, and the Beclin-1 stabilizing, antihelminthic drug niclosamide inhibited SARS-CoV-2 propagation by 85, 88, and >99%, respectively. In sum, SARS-CoV-2 infection causally diminishes autophagy. A clinically approved and well-tolerated autophagy-inducing compound shows potential for evaluation as a treatment against SARS-CoV-2.","Gassen, Nils C.; Papies, Jan; Bajaj, Thomas; Dethloff, Frederik; Emanuel, Jackson; Weckmann, Katja; Heinz, Daniel E.; Heinemann, Nicolas; Lennarz, Martina; Richter, Anja; Niemeyer, Daniela; Corman, Victor M.; Giavalisco, Patrick; Drosten, Christian; Müller, Marcel A.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.15.997254,446
641032,Family access to critically ill patients with COVID-19: a noble but demanding goal.,2021-03-10,"The distal lung contains terminal bronchioles and alveoli that facilitate gas exchange and is affected by disorders including interstitial lung disease, cancer, and SARS-CoV-2-associated COVID-19 pneumonia. Investigations of these localized pathologies have been hindered by a lack of 3D in vitro human distal lung culture systems. Further, human distal lung stem cell identification has been impaired by quiescence, anatomic divergence from mouse and lack of lineage tracing and clonogenic culture. Here, we developed robust feeder-free, chemically-defined culture of distal human lung progenitors as organoids derived clonally from single adult human alveolar epithelial type II (AT2) or KRT5+ basal cells. AT2 organoids exhibited AT1 transdifferentiation potential, while basal cell organoids progressively developed lumens lined by differentiated club and ciliated cells. Organoids consisting solely of club cells were not observed. Upon single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), alveolar organoids were composed of proliferative AT2 cells; however, basal organoid KRT5+ cells contained a distinct ITGA6+ITGB4+ mitotic population whose proliferation segregated to a TNFRSF12Ahi subfraction. Clonogenic organoid growth was markedly enriched within the TNFRSF12Ahi subset of FACS-purified ITGA6+ITGB4+ basal cells from human lung or derivative organoids. In vivo, TNFRSF12A+ cells comprised ~10% of KRT5+ basal cells and resided in clusters within terminal bronchioles. To model COVID-19 distal lung disease, we everted the polarity of basal and alveolar organoids to rapidly relocate differentiated club and ciliated cells from the organoid lumen to the exterior surface, thus displaying the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 on the outwardly-facing apical aspect. Accordingly, basal and AT2 “apical-out” organoids were infected by SARS-CoV-2, identifying club cells as a novel target population. This long-term, feeder-free organoid culture of human distal lung alveolar and basal stem cells, coupled with single cell analysis, identifies unsuspected basal cell functional heterogeneity and exemplifies progenitor identification within a slowly proliferating human tissue. Further, our studies establish a facile in vitro organoid model for human distal lung infectious diseases including COVID-19-associated pneumonia.","Salahudeen, Ameen A.; Choi, Shannon S.; Rustagi, Arjun; Zhu, Junjie; de la O, Sean M.; Flynn, Ryan A.; Margalef-Català, Mar; Santos, António J.

In this health emergency, a key element has been and still is the need for information, which has become a daily concern for many people. Social media represent powerful tools for searching and gathering health-related information, thus becoming a new place where health authorities need to be present to disseminate information of preventive measures like vaccines against COVID-19, as well as try to block information against these public health measures. The main goal of this study was to analyze the role that healthcare professionals have in Twitter to support the campaign of public institutions on vaccination against COVID-19. To address this study, an analysis of the messages sent on Twitter containing the hashtag #yomevacuno, between 12 December 2020 was developed using the NodeXL software (Social Media Research Foundation, Redwood, CA, USA), focusing on content analysis of tweets and users’ accounts to identify healthcare professionals. The results show that healthcare professionals represent only 11.38% of users, being responsible for 6.35% of impressions generated by the network #yomevacuno. We can observe that traffic information generated by healthcare professionals is not significant in comparison with institutions (p = 0.633), but it is compared to common users (p = 0.0014). The most active healthcare professionals were pharmacists (40.17%), nurses (27.17%), and physicians (12.14%). Their activity (90.43% of messages) was mainly focused on sharing messages generated by other users’ accounts. From original content generated by healthcare professionals, only 78.95% had a favorable storytelling on the vaccine, but without sharing information about vaccines or vaccination. As a conclusion for this study, the participation of healthcare professionals in the dissemination and generation of information within the #yomevacuno communication strategy, led by the Spanish Ministry of Health, has been scarce. We emphasize the need to enhance communication skills in social networks to support public health campaigns through these increasingly important social media.","Herrera-Peco, Ivan; Jiménez-Gómez, Beatriz; Peña Deudero, Juan José; Benitez De Gracia, Elvira; Ruiz-Núñez, Carlos",Healthcare (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34199495/; https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare9060662,446

Women with PCOS are considered to typically belong to an age and sex group which is at lower risk for severe COVID-19. MAIN BODY: Emerging data link the risk of severe COVID-19 with certain factors such as hyper-inflammation, ethnicity predisposition, low vitamin D levels, and hyperandrogenism, all of which have known direct associations with PCOS. Moreover, in this common female patient population, there is markedly high prevalence of multiple cardio-metabolic conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, obesity, and hypertension, which may significantly increase the risk for adverse COVID-19-related outcomes. This strong overlap of risk factors for both worse PCOS cardio-metabolic manifestations and severe COVID-19 should be highlighted for the clinical practice, particularly since women with PCOS often receive fragmented care from multiple healthcare services. Comprehensively informing women with PCOS regarding the potential risks from COVID-19 and how this may affect their management is also essential. CONCLUSION: Despite the immense challenges posed by the COVID-19 outbreak to the healthcare systems in affected countries, attention should be directed to maintain a high standard of care for complex patients such as many women with PCOS and provide relevant practical recommendations for optimal management in the setting of this fast moving pandemic.","Kyrou, Ioannis; Karteris, Emmanouil; Robbins, Tim; Chatha, Kamaljit; Drenos, Fotios; Randeva, Harpal S.",BMC Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32664957/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-020-01697-5,446

645857,ACCCN and ACIPC Position Statement on Facilitating Next-of-Kin Presence for Patients Dying from COVID-19 in the ICU,2020-07-16,"Following the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, analysts have noted a global rise of nationalism as countries have engaged in a number of nationalist moves in response to the pandemic. However, the implication of policy changes at the individual-level remains unclear: do citizens support those nationalist government responses? More importantly, do people tend to be more nationalistic following the outbreak? Building on terror management theory (TMT), this article examines whether and how ideological beliefs affect individuals’ support for nationalist policies during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to TMT, to cope with death anxiety, people are predisposed to ideological defense, resulting in cohesion with individuals who validate their beliefs and hostility toward those who threaten them. Thus, we argue that when states’ nationalist policies are aligned with their ideology, people tend to support them; yet, when states’ nationalist policies contradict their ideology, people tend to withdraw their support. Specifically, this study found that as non-conservatives (compared to conservatives) are more concerned with the virus, they are more likely to show an inclination of ideological validation. Given that their ideology advocates more tolerance, non-conservatives are less likely to support nationalistic policies. To test the hypotheses, we applied structural equation modeling to a March 2020 CNN Poll (nationally representative US data about COVID-19). The statistical analysis demonstrated strong support for our arguments.","Su, Ruolin; Shen, Wensong",J Chin Polit Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11366-020-09696-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32952388/,446

This study aimed to cross-culturally modify the smoking media literacy scale and evaluate the validity and reliability of the Korean version of the revised Smoking Media Literacy Scale for Adolescents (K-SMLS). The translation of the K-SMLS was conducted according to the World Health Organization's guidelines. After the translation process, an online survey was conducted with convenience samples of 215 total adolescents from five high schools in the capital city of Korea. Construct validity was examined by exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. Internal consistency reliability was examined with Cronbach's alpha. The final version of the K-SMLS consisted of 15 items. The goodness of fit, determined through a confirmatory factor analysis of the three domains, was acceptable [χ(2) = 237.85 (p < 0.001), CFI = 0.93, TLI = 0.92, RMSEA = 0.09, SRMR = 0.09]. The reliability of the K-SMLS was satisfactory (Cronbach's alpha = 0.79).

However, effects of these interventions on epidemic dynamics are yet to be understood. Rates of laboratory‐confirmed COVID‐19 infections per day and effective reproduction number (R(t)) were estimated for 7 periods (Pre‐lockdown, Lockdown Phases 1 to 4 and Unlock 1–2) according to nationally implemented interventions with phased relaxation. Adoption of these interventions was estimated using Google mobility data. Estimates at the national level and for 12 Indian states most affected by COVID‐19 are presented. Daily case rates ranged from 0.03 to 285.60/10 million people across 7 discrete periods in India. From 18 May to 31 July 2020, the NCT of Delhi had the highest case rate (999/10 million people/day), whereas Madhya Pradesh had the lowest (49/10 million/day). Average R(t) was 1.99 (95% CI 1.93–2.06) and 1.39 (95% CI 1.38–1.40) for the entirety of India during the period from 22 March 2020 to 17 May 2020 and from 18 May 2020 to 31 July 2020, respectively.

Median mobility in the ‘Grocery and Pharmacy’ returned to levels observed before 22 March 2020 in Unlock 1 and 2, and the enhanced mobility in the Pharmacy sector needs to be investigated. The Indian government imposed strict contact mitigation, followed by a phased relaxation, which slowed the spread of COVID‐19 epidemic progression in India.

Preventive services and hospital care in the province of Reggio Emilia, Northern Italy. Participants. All 2653 symptomatic patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 from February 27 to April 2, 2020 in the province of Reggio Emilia. Main outcome measures. Hospitalization and death up to April 2, 2020. Results. Females had higher prevalence of infection than males below age 50 (2.61 vs. 1.84 per 1000), but lower in older ages (16.49 vs. 20.86 per 1000 over age 80). Case fatality rate reached 20.7% (22/106) in cases with more than 4 weeks follow up. After adjusting for age and comorbidities, men had a higher risk of hospitalization (hazard ratio (HR) 1.4 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.2 to 1.6) and of death (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.1).

The intervention efficacy or effectiveness hierarchy, however, is still not clear. Therefore, we propose to conduct a network meta-analysis to assess the relative effectiveness of various types of DTPs. We aim to establish the differential effectiveness of these therapies in terms of symptom reduction and provide high-quality evidence for treating PTSD. METHODS AND ANALYSES: We will search Embase, CINAHL, MEDLINE, HealthSTAR, the Cochrane Library, PsycINFO, PubMed, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, clinical trials (eg, ClinicalTrials.gov) and other academic platforms for relevant studies, mainly in English and Chinese (as we plan to conduct a trial on PTSD patients in Wuhan, China, based on the results of this network meta-analysis), from inception to October 2020. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses investigating the effectiveness of any DTPs for PTSD patients for any controlled condition will be included. The number of intervention sessions and the research duration are unlimited; the effects for different durations will be tested via sensitivity analysis. For this project, the primary measure of outcome will be PTSD symptoms at the end of treatment using raw scores for one widely used PTSD scale, PCL-5. Secondary outcome measures will include (1) dropout rate; (2) effectiveness at longest follow-up, but not more than 12 months and (3) patients’ functional recovery ratio (such as the return-to-work ratio or percentage of sick leave). Bayesian network meta-analysis will be conducted for all relative outcome measures. We will perform subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis to see whether the results are influenced by study characteristics. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessments, Development, and Evaluation framework will be adopted to evaluate the quality of evidence contributing to network estimates of the primary outcome. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The researchers of the primary trials already have had ethical approval for the data used in our study. We will present the results of this meta-analysis at academic conferences and publish them in peer-reviewed journals.

LEADER and other trials revealed cardioprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs like liraglutide (Lira). We previously demonstrated improved survival in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced endotoxemia by inhibition of GLP-1 degradation. Here we investigate the effects of Lira in the polymicrobial sepsis model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). C57BL/6J mice were intraperitoneally injected with Lira (200 µg/kg/d; 3 days) and sepsis induced by CLP after one day of GLP-1 analog treatment. Survival and body temperature were monitored. Aortic vascular function (isometric tension recording), protein expression (immunohistochemistry and dot blot) and gene expression (qRT-PCR) were determined. Endothelium-dependent relaxation in the aorta was impaired by CLP and correlated with markers of inflammation (e.g., interleukin 6 and inducible nitric oxide synthase) and oxidative stress (e.g., 3-nitrotyrosine) was higher in septic mice, all of which was almost completely normalized by Lira therapy. We demonstrate that the GLP-1 analog Lira ameliorates sepsis-induced endothelial dysfunction by the reduction of vascular inflammation and oxidative stress. Accordingly, the findings suggest that the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of GLP-1 analogs may be a valuable tool to protect the cardiovascular system from dysbalanced inflammation in polymicrobial sepsis.","Helmstädter, Johanna; Keppeler, Karin; Aust, Franziska; Küster, Leonie; Frenis, Katie; Filippou, Konstantina; Vujacic-Mirski, Ksenija; Tsohataridis, Simeon; Kalinovic, Sanela; Kröller-Schön, Swenja; Oelze, Matthias; Bosmann, Markus; Münzel, Thomas; Daiber, Andreas; Steven, Sebastian",Antioxidants (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox10081175; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34439423/,446

As testing and tracing capacities increase, frameworks are needed to inform design and delivery to ensure their effective implementation and equitable distribution, and to strengthen community engagement in slowing and eventually stopping Covid-19 transmission. In this commentary, we highlight opportunities for integrating implementation research into planned and employed strategies in the United States to accelerate reach and effectiveness of interventions to more safely relax social distancing policies and open economies, schools, and other institutions. Implementation strategies, such as adapting evidence-based interventions based on contextual factors, promoting community engagement, and providing data audit and feedback on implementation outcomes, can support the translation of policies on testing, tracing, social distancing, and public mask use into reality. These data can demonstrate how interventions are put into practice and where adaptation in policy or practice is needed to respond to the needs of specific communities and socially vulnerable populations. Incorporating implementation research into Covid-19 policy design and translation into practice is urgently needed to mitigate the worsening health inequities in the pandemic toll and response. Applying rigorous implementation research frameworks and evaluation systems to the implementation of evidence-based interventions which are adapted to contextual factors can promote effective and equitable pandemic response and accelerate learning both among local stakeholders as well as between states to further inform their varied experiences and responses to the pandemic.","Jacobson, Tyler A.; Smith, Lauren E.; Hirschhorn, Lisa R.; Huffman, Mark D.",Int J Equity Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33004064/; https://doi.org/10.1186/s12939-020-01293-2,446

To comprehensively investigate the complex interaction between HSV-1 and its host we combined two genome-scale screens for host factors (HFs) involved in virus replication. A yeast two-hybrid screen for protein interactions and a RNA interference (RNAi) screen with a druggable genome small interfering RNA (siRNA) library confirmed existing and identified novel HFs which functionally influence HSV-1 infection. Bioinformatic analyses found the 358 HFs were enriched for several pathways and multi-protein complexes. Of particular interest was the identification of Med23 as a strongly anti-viral component of the largely pro-viral Mediator complex, which links specific transcription factors to RNA polymerase II. The anti-viral effect of Med23 on HSV-1 replication was confirmed in gain-of-function gene overexpression experiments, and this inhibitory effect was specific to HSV-1, as a range of other viruses including Vaccinia virus and Semliki Forest virus were unaffected by Med23 depletion. We found Med23 significantly upregulated expression of the type III interferon family (IFN-λ) at the mRNA and protein level by directly interacting with the transcription factor IRF7. The synergistic effect of Med23 and IRF7 on IFN-λ induction suggests this is the major transcription factor for IFN-λ expression. Genotypic analysis of patients suffering recurrent orofacial HSV-1 outbreaks, previously shown to be deficient in IFN-λ secretion, found a significant correlation with a single nucleotide polymorphism in the IFN-λ3 (IL28b) promoter strongly linked to Hepatitis C disease and treatment outcome. This paper describes a link between Med23 and IFN-λ, provides evidence for the crucial role of IFN-λ in HSV-1 immune control, and highlights the power of integrative genome-scale approaches to identify HFs critical for disease progression and outcome.","Griffiths, Samantha J.; Koegl, Manfred; Boutell, Chris; Zenner, Helen L.; Crump, Colin M.; Pica, Francesca; Gonzalez, Orland; Friedel, Caroline C.; Barry, Gerald; Martin, Kim; Craigon, Marie H.; Chen, Rui; Kaza, Lakshmi N.; Fossum, Even; Fazakerley, John K.; Efstathiou, Stacey; Volpi, Antonio; Zimmer, Ralf; Ghazal, Peter; Haas, Jürgen",PLoS Pathog,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1003514; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23950709/,446

650533,The effect of age on the incidence of COVID-19 complications: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2021-03-20,"BACKGROUND: Dementia-like cognitive impairment is an increasingly reported complication of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this complication remain unclear. A better understanding of causative processes by which COVID-19 may lead to cognitive impairment is essential for developing preventive and therapeutic interventions. METHODS: In this study, we conducted a network-based, multimodal omics comparison of COVID-19 and neurologic complications. We constructed the SARS-CoV-2 virus-host interactome from protein-protein interaction assay and CRISPR-Cas9-based genetic assay results and compared network-based relationships therein with those of known neurological manifestations using network proximity measures. We also investigated the transcriptomic profiles (including single-cell/nuclei RNA-sequencing) of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) marker genes from patients infected with COVID-19, as well as the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in the brains of AD patients not infected with SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: We found significant network-based relationships between COVID-19 and neuroinflammation and brain microvascular injury pathways and processes which are implicated in AD. We also detected aberrant expression of AD biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood of patients with COVID-19. While transcriptomic analyses showed relatively low expression of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors in human brain, neuroinflammatory changes were pronounced. In addition, single-nucleus transcriptomic analyses showed that expression of SARS-CoV-2 host factors (BSG and FURIN) and antiviral defense genes (LY6E, IFITM2, IFITM3, and IFNAR1) was elevated in brain endothelial cells of AD patients and healthy controls relative to neurons and other cell types, suggesting a possible role for brain microvascular injury in COVID-19-mediated cognitive impairment. Overall, individuals with the AD risk allele APOE E4/E4 displayed reduced expression of antiviral defense genes compared to APOE E3/E3 individuals. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest significant mechanistic overlap between AD and COVID-19, centered on neuroinflammation and microvascular injury. These results help improve our understanding of COVID-19-associated neurological manifestations and provide guidance for future development of preventive or treatment interventions, although causal relationship and mechanistic pathways between COVID-19 and AD need future investigations.

Chronic wounds are typically characterized as being hypoxic in that the partial pressure of oxygen (pO(2)) in the center of the wound is often below a critical threshold necessary to fully support those enzymatic processes necessary for tissue repair. Providing supplemental oxygen can effectively raise pO(2) levels to better optimize functioning of these essential enzymes. While hyperbaric oxygen therapy has been well studied in this regard, comparative clinical studies have fallen short of providing clear evidence in support of this modality for healing chronic diabetic foot ulcers (DFU). Topical oxygen therapy (TOT) has been in clinical use for over 50 years with encouraging pre-clinical and clinical studies that have shown improved healing rates when compared to standard care. Nonetheless, TOT has heretofore been discounted as an unproven wound healing modality without theoretical or clinical evidence to support its use. This review shall provide a brief summary of the role of oxygen in wound healing and, specifically, discuss the different types of topical oxygen devices and associated studies that have convincingly shown their efficacy in healing chronic DFUs.

652241,Commentary: Keeping Surgical Patients Safe During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Los Angeles vs. New York City,2020-08-03,"The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its pathogen, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) have become the greatest current threat to global public health. The highly infectious SARS-CoV-2 virus primarily attacks pulmonary tissues and impairs gas exchange leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and systemic hypoxia. The current pharmacotherapies for COVID-19 largely rely on supportive and anti-thrombi treatment and the repurposing of antimalarial and antiviral drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir. For a better mechanistic understanding of COVID-19, our present review focuses on its primary pathophysiologic features: hypoxia and cytokine storm, which are a prelude to multiple organ failure and lethality. We discussed a possible link between the activation of hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and cell entry of SARS-CoV-2, since HIF-1α is shown to suppress the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor and transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) and upregulate disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 17 (ADAM17). In addition, the protein targets of HIF-1α are involved with the activation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and the subsequent inflammatory process. Furthermore, we hypothesized a potential utility of so-called “hypoxic conditioning” to activate HIF-1α-induced cytoprotective signaling for reduction of illness severity and improvement of vital organ function in patients with COVID-19. Taken together, we would propose further investigations into the hypoxia-related molecular mechanisms, from which novel targeted therapies can be developed for the improved management of COVID-19.","Serebrovska, Zoya O.; Chong, Elisa Y.; Serebrovska, Tetiana V.; Tumanovska, Lesia V.; Xi, Lei",Acta Pharmacol Sin,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33110240/; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41401-020-00554-8,446

The COVID-19 lesson,2021-09-06,"BACKGROUND: 3D printed patient-specific anatomical models have been applied clinically to orthopaedic care for surgical planning and patient education. The estimated cost and print time per model for 3D printers have not yet been compared with clinically representative models across multiple printing technologies. This study investigates six commercially-available 3D printers: Prusa i3 MK3S, Formlabs Form 2, Formlabs Form 3, LulzBot TAZ 6, Stratasys F370, and Stratasys J750 Digital Anatomy. METHODS: Seven representative orthopaedic standard tessellation models derived from CT scans were imported into the respective slicing software for each 3D printer. For each printer and corresponding print setting, the slicing software provides a print time and material use estimate. Material quantity was used to calculate estimated model cost. Print settings investigated were infill percentage, layer height, and model orientation on the print bed. The slicing software investigated are Cura LulzBot Edition 3.6.20, GrabCAD Print 1.43, PreForm 3.4.6, and PrusaSlicer 2.2.0. RESULTS: The effect of changing infill between 15% and 20% on estimated print time and material use was negligible. Orientation of the model has considerable impact on time and cost with worst-case differences being as much as 39.30% added print time and 34.56% added costs. Averaged across all investigated settings, horizontal model orientation on the print bed minimizes estimated print time for all 3D printers, while vertical model orientation minimizes cost with the exception of Stratasys J750 Digital Anatomy, in which horizontal orientation also minimized cost. Decreasing layer height for all investigated printers increased estimated print time and decreased estimated cost with the exception of Stratasys F370, in which cost increased. The difference in material cost was two orders of magnitude between the least and most-expensive printers. The difference in build rate (cm(3)/min) was one order of magnitude between the fastest and slowest printers. CONCLUSIONS: All investigated 3D printers in this study have the potential for clinical utility. Print time and print cost are dependent on orientation of anatomy and the printers and settings selected. Cost-effective clinical 3D printing of anatomic models should consider an appropriate printer for the complexity of the anatomy and the experience of the printer technicians.

Logistic Regression with L1 regularization (LASSO) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models were trained using local data at each site, a pooled model with combined data from all five sites, and a federated model that only shared parameters with a central aggregator. Both the federated LASSO and federated MLP models performed better than their local model counterparts at four hospitals.

By contrast, although the bootstrap t test was proposed in 1993, it is seldom adopted in medical research. We aim to demonstrate that the bootstrap t test outperforms Student's t test under normality in data. Using random data samples from normal distributions, we evaluated the testing performance, in terms of true-positive rate (TPR) and false-positive rate and diagnostic abilities, in terms of the area under the curve (AUC), of the bootstrap t test and Student's t test. We explore the AUC of both tests with varying sample size and coefficient of variation. We compare the testing outcomes using the COVID-19 serial interval (SI) data in Shenzhen and Hong Kong, China, for demonstration. With fixed TPR, the bootstrap t test maintained the equivalent accuracy in TPR, but significantly improved the true-negative rate from the Student's t test. With varying TPR, the diagnostic ability of bootstrap t test outperformed or equivalently performed as Student's t test in terms of the AUC. The equivalent performances are possible but rarely occur in practice. We find that the bootstrap t test outperforms by successfully detecting the difference in COVID-19 SI, which is defined as the time interval between consecutive transmission generations, due to sex and non-pharmaceutical interventions against the Student's t test. We demonstrated that the bootstrap t test outperforms Student's t test, and it is recommended to replace Student's t test in medical data analysis regardless of sample size.","Zhao, Shi; Yang, Zuyao; Musa, Salihu S.; Ran, Jinjun; Chong, Marc K.

METHODS: Clinical records, laboratory results, and chest CT scans were retrospectively reviewed for 55 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia (i.e., with throat swab samples that were positive for SARS-CoV-2) who were admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, from Jan. 8 to Feb. 10, 2020. RESULTS: All 55 patients had a history of epidemiological exposure to COVID-19, and 5 (9%) patients who discharged from hospital presented with SARS-CoV-2 reactivation. Among the 5 reactivated patients, other symptoms were also observed, including fever, cough, sore throat, and fatigue. One of the 5 patients had progressive lymphopenia (from 1.3 to 0.56 × 10(9) cells per L) and progressive neutrophilia (from 4.5 to 18.28 × 10(9) cells per L). All 5 reactivated patients presented normal aminotransferase levels. Throat swab samples from the 5 reactivated patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2, indicating all positive for the virus.

G3BPs appear to facilitate this activity through their role in stress granules for which they are considered a core component, however, it should be noted that not all stress granules contain G3BPs and this appears to be contextual depending on the environmental stress and the cell type. Although the role of G3BPs in stress granules appears to be one of its major roles, data also strongly suggests that they interact with mRNAs outside of stress granules to regulate gene expression. G3BPs have been implicated in several diseases including cancer progression, invasion, and metastasis as well as virus survival. There is now a body of evidence that suggests targeting of G3BPs could be explored as a form of cancer therapeutic. This review discusses the important discoveries and advancements made in the field of G3BPs biology over the last two decades including their roles in RNA stability, translational control of cellular transcripts, stress granule formation, cancer progression and its interactions with viruses during infection. An emerging theme for G3BPs is their ability to regulate gene expression in response to environmental stimuli, disease progression and virus infection making it an intriguing target for disease therapies.","Alam, Umber; Kennedy, Derek",Biochim Biophys Acta Mol Cell Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30595162/; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167488918303434; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0167488918303434; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbamcr.2018.09.001,446
654888,"Chloroquine for COVID-19: rationale, facts, hopes",2020-05-08,"ABSTRACT BACKGROUND The COVID-19 epidemic, first emerged in Wuhan during December 2019, has spread globally. While the mass population movement for Chinese New Year has significantly influenced spreading the disease, little direct evidence exists about the relevance to epidemic and its control of population movement from Wuhan, local emergency response, and medical resources in China. METHODS Spearman's correlation analysis was performed between official data of confirmed COVID-19 cases from Jan 20th to Feb 19th, 2020 and real-time travel data and health resources data. RESULTS There were 74,675 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China by Feb 19th, 2020. The overall fatality rate was 2.84%, much higher in Hubei than in other regions (3.27% vs 0.73%). The index of population inflow from Hubei was positively correlated with total (Provincial r=0.9159, p<0.001; City r=0.6311, p<0.001) and primary cases (Provincial r=0.8702, p<0.001; City r=0.6358, p<0.001). The local health emergency measures (eg, city lockdown and traffic control) were associated with reduced infections nationwide. Moreover, the number of public health employees per capita was inversely correlated with total cases (r=-0.6295, p<0.001) and infection rates (r=-0.4912, p<0.01). Similarly, cities with less medical resources had higher fatality (r=-0.4791, p<0.01) and lower cure rates (r=0.5286, p<0.01) among the confirmed cases. CONCLUSIONS The spread of the COVID-19 in China in its early phase was attributed primarily to population movement from Hubei, and effective governmental health emergency measures and adequate medical resources played important roles in subsequent control of epidemic and improved prognosis of affected individuals.","Ying, Songmin; Li, Fei; Geng, Xinwei; Li, Zhouyang; Du, Xufei; Chen, Haixia; Chen, Sisi; Zhang, Min; Shao, Zhehua; Wu, Yinfang; Syeda, Madiha Zahra; Yan, Fugui; Che, Luanqing; Zhang, Bin; Lou, Jian; Wang, Shaobin; Chen, Zhengming; Li, Wen; Shen, Ye; Chen, Zhihua; Shen, Huahao",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.24.20027623,446

These changes included an increase in reliance on telemedicine modalities, a reduction in services or hours of operation, and prohibiting guests and nonessential personnel from healthcare settings. We describe a rapid environmental assessment with senior emergency department (ED) practitioners in Rhode Island to understand how COVID-related procedural changes impact the provision of post-overdose care in ED. METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 14 senior healthcare practitioners in EDs across Rhode Island from June to July 2020. Interviews were part of a larger, ongoing study examining the implementation and effectiveness of post-opioid overdose care in EDs and sought to understand how COVID-19 had impacted the provision of services for people who use drugs (PWUD). RESULTS: COVID-related policy changes challenged the provision of services to PWUD in the ED, and extended challenges in connecting people with OUD to services in the community. Specifically, challenges included transitions to telehealth modalities, required COVID tests for treatment services, and gaps in community resources. CONCLUSIONS: This study underscores opportunities to improve the delivery of services amid overlapping public health crises for PWUD, including bolstering the use of telemedicine in EDs and across the care continuum.","Collins, Alexandra B.; Beaudoin, Francesca L.; Samuels, Elizabeth A.; Wightman, Rachel; Baird, Janette",J Addict Med,https://doi.org/10.1097/adm.0000000000000779; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33201002/,446

660992,Evidence for Chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine in the Treatment of COVID-19,2021-04-11,"G-quadruplexes are four-stranded conformations of nucleic acids that act as cellular epigenetic regulators. A dynamic G-quadruplex forming region in the HIV-1 LTR promoter represses HIV-1 transcription when in the folded conformation. This activity is enhanced by nucleolin, which induces and stabilizes the HIV-1 LTR G-quadruplexes. In this work by a combined pull-down/mass spectrometry approach, we consistently found hnRNP A2/B1 as an additional LTR-G-quadruplex interacting protein. Surface plasmon resonance confirmed G-quadruplex specificity over linear sequences and fluorescence resonance energy transfer analysis indicated that hnRNP A2/B1 is able to efficiently unfold the LTR G-quadruplexes. Evaluation of the thermal stability of the LTR G-quadruplexes in different-length oligonucleotides showed that the protein is fit to be most active in the LTR full-length environment. When hnRNP A2/B1 was silenced in cells, LTR activity decreased, indicating that the protein acts as a HIV-1 transcription activator. Our data highlight a tightly regulated control of transcription based on G-quadruplex folding/unfolding, which depends on interacting cellular proteins. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the viral transcription mechanism and may pave the way to the development of drugs effective against the integrated HIV-1, present both in actively and latently infected cells.","Scalabrin, Matteo; Frasson, Ilaria; Ruggiero, Emanuela; Perrone, Rosalba; Tosoni, Elena; Lago, Sara; Tassinari, Martina; Palù, Giorgio; Richter, Sara N.",Sci Rep,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28338097/; https://doi.org/10.1038/srep45244,446

Our aims were to evaluate the presence of acute pancreatitis in COVID-19 patients and to assess the frequency of pancreatic hyperenzymemia. METHODS: From April 1, 2020, to April 30, 2020, 110 consecutive patients (69 males, 41 females; mean age, 63.0 years; range, 24–93 years) met these criteria and were enrolled in the study. The clinical data and serum activity of pancreatic amylase and lipase were assayed in all patients using commercially available kits. RESULTS: None of the patients studied developed clinical signs or morphological alterations compatible with acute pancreatitis. However, it was found that 24.5% of the patients had amylase values above 53 IU/L and 16.4% had lipase values above 300 IU/L. Only 1 patient (0.9%) had both amylase and lipase values in excess of 3-fold the upper normal limit without clinical signs of pancreatitis.

Many metagenomic data sets are now available, with deep sequencing of samples from diverse biological niches. While any individual metagenomic data set can be readily queried using web-based tools, meta-searches through all such data sets are less accessible. In this brief communication, we demonstrate such a meta-metagenomic approach, examining close matches to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in all high-throughput sequencing data sets in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive accessible with the “virome” keyword. In addition to the homology to bat coronaviruses observed in descriptions of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence (F. Wu, S. Zhao, B. Yu, Y. M.

(P. Liu, W. Chen, and J. P. Chen, Viruses 11:979, 2019, https://doi.org/10.3390/v11110979). While analysis of these reads indicates the presence of a similar viral sequence in pangolin lung, the similarity is not sufficient to either confirm or rule out a role for pangolins as an intermediate host in the recent emergence of SARS-CoV-2. In addition to the implications for SARS-CoV-2 emergence, this study illustrates the utility and limitations of meta-metagenomic search tools in effective and rapid characterization of potentially significant nucleic acid sequences.

Here, we assess immunogenicity and anamnestic protective efficacy in rhesus macaques of the intradermal (ID)-delivered SARS-CoV-2 spike DNA vaccine, INO-4800. INO-4800 is an ID-delivered DNA vaccine currently being evaluated in clinical trials. Vaccination with INO-4800 induced T cell responses and neutralizing antibody responses against both the D614 and G614 SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins. Several months after vaccination, animals were challenged with SARS-CoV-2 resulting in rapid recall of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein T and B cell responses. These responses were associated with lower viral loads in the lung and with faster nasal clearance of virus. These studies support the immune impact of INO-4800 for inducing both humoral and cellular arms of the adaptive immune system which are likely important for providing durable protection against COVID-19 disease.","Patel, Ami; Walters, Jewell; Reuschel, Emma L.; Schultheis, Katherine; Parzych, Elizabeth; Gary, Ebony N.; Maricic, Igor; Purwar, Mansi; Eblimit, Zeena; Walker, Susanne N.; Guimet, Diana; Bhojnagarwala, Pratik; Doan, Arthur; Xu, Ziyang; Elwood, Dustin; Reeder, Sophia M.; Pessaint, Laurent; Kim, Kevin Y.; Cook, Anthony; Chokkalingam, Neethu; Finneyfrock, Brad; Tello-Ruiz, Edgar; Dodson, Alan; Choi, Jihae; Generotti, Alison; Harrison, John; Tursi, Nicholas J.; Andrade, Viviane M.; Dia, Yaya; Zaidi, Faraz I.; Andersen, Hanne; Lewis, Mark G.; Muthumani, Kar; Kim, J Joseph; Kulp, Daniel W.; Humeau, Laurent M.; Ramos, Stephanie; Smith, Trevor R.F.; Weiner, David B.; Broderick, Kate E.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.28.225649,446

Patients are already at significant risk of healthcare-associated harm and the wholesale disruption to service delivery during the pandemic stood to heighten those risks. OBJECTIVES: We explored the type and nature of patient safety incidents in French primary care settings during the COVID-19 first wave to make tentative recommendations for improvement. METHODS: A national patient safety incident reporting survey was distributed to General Practitioners (GPs) in France on 28 April 2020. Reports were coded using a classification system aligned to the WHO International Classification for Patient Safety (incident types, contributing factors, incident outcomes and severity of harm). Analysis involved data coding, processing, iterative generation of data summaries using descriptive statistical analysis. Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04346121. RESULTS: Of 132 incidents, 58 (44%) related to delayed diagnosis, assessments and referrals. Cancellations of appointments, hospitalisations or procedures was reported in 22 (17%) of these incidents. Home confinement-related incidents accounted for 13 (10%) reports and inappropriate medication stopping for five (4%). Patients delayed attending or did not consult their general practitioner or other healthcare providers due to their fear of contracting COVID-19 infection at an in-person visit in 26 (10%) incidents or fear of burdening their GPs in eight (3%) incidents. CONCLUSION: Constraints from the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic have contributed to patient safety incidents during non-COVID-19 care.

The generation time, also known as the generation interval, is the time between infection events in an infector infectee pair. The serial interval and the generation time are key parameters for assessing the dynamics of a disease. A number of scientific papers reported information pertaining to the serial interval and/or generation time for COVID19. Objectives: Conduct a rapid review of available evidence to advise on appropriate parameter values for serial interval and generation time in national COVID19 transmission models for Ireland and on methodological issues relating to those parameters. Methods: A review of scientific literature was conducted covering the period between December 1, 2019 and April 27, 2020. Nineteen scientific papers were evaluated in detail from 27 papers that contained information on the serial interval and/or generation time for COVID19. Results: The mean of the serial interval ranged from 3.1 to 7.5 days, based on 22 estimates, and the median from 1.9 to 6.0 days (based on 7 estimates). Only three estimates were provided for the mean of the generation time. These ranged from 3.9 to 5.2 days. One estimate of 5.0 days was provided for the median of the generation time. Discussion: The values of the estimates for serial interval and generation time are heavily influenced by the contact rates between infectious and susceptible individuals. Mitigation measures that are introduced in a country or region are of paramount importance in this regard. The serial interval estimate of 6.6 days (95% confidence interval: 0.7, 19.0) from the paper by Cereda et al.[10] is likely to be the most relevant to European countries.

Brugada syndrome (BrS) is an important but underrecognized cause of SCD. It is more commonly seen in schizophrenia than in general population controls. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review to describe the pathogenesis of BrS in schizophrenia and to identify the psychotropic medications that increase the risk of unmasking BrS and associated ventricular arrhythmias resulting in SCD. FINDINGS: Schizophrenia and BrS share similar calcium channel abnormalities, which may result in aberrant myocardial conductivity. It remains uncertain if there is a genetic pre-disposition for BrS in a subset of patients with schizophrenia. However, the unmasking of Brugada ECG patterns with the use of certain antipsychotics and antidepressants increases the risk of precipitating SCD, independent of QT prolongation. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Specific cardiology assessment and interventions may be required for the congenital or unmasked Brugada ECG pattern in schizophrenia. The current long-term standard of care for BrS is an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), but post-implantation psychological effects must be considered. Careful use of antipsychotic and other psychotropic medications is necessary to minimize proarrhythmic effects due to impact on cardiac sodium and calcium ion channels. When prescribing such drugs to patients with schizophrenia, clinicians should be mindful of the potentially fatal unmasking of Brugada ECG patterns and how to manage it.

Methods We studied retrospectively 263 COVID-19 ICU patients. To find parameters with the highest predictive values, Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Pearson chi-squared tests were used. Logistic regression and random forest (RF) algorithms were utilized to build classification models. The impact of each marker on the RF model predictions was studied by implementing the local interpretable model-agnostic explanation technique (LIME-SP). Results Among 66 documented parameters, 15 factors with the highest predictive values were identified as follows: gender, age, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, international normalized ratio (INR), albumin, mean corpuscular volume, white blood cell count, segmented neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, red cell distribution width (RDW), and mean cell hemoglobin along with a history of neurological, cardiovascular, and respiratory disorders. Our RF model can predict patients outcomes with a sensitivity of 70% and a specificity of 75%. Conclusions The most decisive variables in our model were increased levels of BUN, lowered albumin levels, increased creatinine, INR, and RDW along with gender and age. Complete blood count parameters were also crucial for some patients. Considering the importance of early triage decisions, this model can be a useful tool in COVID-19 ICU decision-making.","Jamshidi, E.; Asgary, A.; Tavakoli, N.; Zali, A.; Esmaily, H.; Jamaldini, S.

671737,"Depression, Anxiety and Stress among Nepali Health Care Workers during the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic: A Cross-sectional Survey",2021-06-30,"BACKGROUND: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the outbreak of coronavirus disease in 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared as a pandemic and public health emergency that infected more than 5 million people worldwide at the time of writing this protocol. Strong evidence for the outcome of COVID-19 among the geriatric age group has not been published in Africa. Therefore, this protocol will be served as a guideline to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the outcome of COVID-19 among the geriatric age group in Africa. METHODS: Published and unpublished studies on the outcome of COVID-19 among the geriatric age group in Africa and written in any language will be included. Databases (PubMed / MEDLINE, Google Scholar, Google, EMBASE, Web of Science, Microsoft Academic, WHO COVID-19 database, Cochran Library, Africa Wide Knowledge, and Africa Index Medicus) from March to August 2020 will be searched. Two independent reviewers will select, screen, extract data, and assess the risk of bias. The proportion will be measured using a random-effects model. Subgroup analysis will be conducted to manage heterogeneity. The presence of publication bias will be assessed using Egger’s test and visual inspection of the funnel plots. This systematic and meta-analysis review protocol will be reported per the PRISMA-P guidelines. CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis protocol will be expected to quantify the outcome of COVID-19 among the geriatric age group in Africa.

The placental changes found in pregnant women have a definite impact on the foetus. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 25-year-old woman, gravida 3, para 2 (2 alive children), with a history of two caesarean deliveries, who was infected by the SARS-CoV-2 during the last term of her pregnancy. She gave birth by caesarean at 34 weeks of gestation to a newborn baby also infected with SARS-CoV-2. The peri-operative observations noted several eruptive lesions in the pelvis, bleeding on contact. Microscopic examination of the foetal appendages revealed thrombotic vasculopathy in the placenta and in the umbilical cord vessels.

673302,“Hydroxychloroquine in patients with COVID-19: A Systematic Review and meta-analysis.”,2020-05-12,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents one of the most challenging global crises at the dawn of a new decade. Public health authorities (PHAs) are increasingly adopting the use of social media such as Facebook to rapidly communicate and disseminate pandemic response measures to the public. Understanding of communication strategies across different PHAs and examining the public response on the social media landscapes can help improve practices for disseminating information to the public. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to examine COVID-19-related outreach efforts of PHAs in Singapore, the United States, and England, and the corresponding public response to these outreach efforts on Facebook. METHODS: Posts and comments from the Facebook pages of the Ministry of Health (MOH) in Singapore, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the United States, and Public Health England (PHE) in England were extracted from January 1, 2019, to March 18, 2020. Posts published before January 1, 2020, were categorized as pre-COVID-19, while the remaining posts were categorized as peri-COVID-19 posts. COVID-19-related posts were identified and classified into themes. Metrics used for measuring outreach and engagement were frequency, mean posts per day (PPD), mean reactions per post, mean shares per post, and mean comments per post. Responses to the COVID-19 posts were measured using frequency, mean sentiment polarity, positive to negative sentiments ratio (PNSR), and positive to negative emotions ratio (PNER). Toxicity in comments were identified and analyzed using frequency, mean likes per toxic comment, and mean replies per toxic comment. Trend analysis was performed to examine how the metrics varied with key events such as when COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. RESULTS: The MOH published more COVID-19 posts (n=271; mean PPD 5.0) compared to the CDC (n=94; mean PPD 2.2) and PHE (n=45; mean PPD 1.4). The mean number of comments per COVID-19 post was highest for the CDC (mean CPP 255.3) compared to the MOH (mean CPP 15.6) and PHE (mean CPP 12.5). Six major themes were identified, with posts about prevention and safety measures and situation updates being prevalent across the three PHAs. The themes of the MOH’s posts were diverse, while the CDC and PHE posts focused on a few themes. Overall, response sentiments for the MOH posts (PNSR 0.94) were more favorable compared to response sentiments for the CDC (PNSR 0.57) and PHE (PNSR 0.55) posts. Toxic comments were rare (0.01%) across all PHAs. CONCLUSIONS: PHAs’ extent of Facebook use for outreach purposes during the COVID-19 pandemic varied among the three PHAs, highlighting the strategies and approaches that other PHAs can potentially adopt. Our study showed that social media analysis was capable of providing insights about the communication strategies of PHAs during disease outbreaks.","Sesagiri Raamkumar, Aravind; Tan, Soon Guan; Wee, Hwee Lin",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32401219/; https://doi.org/10.2196/19334,446
673791,The Levels of COVID-19 Related Health Literacy among University Students in Vietnam,2021-03-16,"BACKGROUND: Vesiviruses (family Caliciviridae) had been shown capable of invading a variety of host species, raising concern of their zoonotic potential. Since the 1980’s, several canine caliciviruses (CaCV) isolates have been reported and are phylogenetically related to the vesiviruses with features distinct from both Vesicular exanthema of swine virus (VESV) and Feline calicivirus (FCV) species in phylogeny, serology and cell culture specificities. Etiological studies of canine diseases in dogs used for military services and laboratory studies were conducted in 1963–1978 at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research. Multiple known and unknown viral pathogens including caliciviruses were recovered. METHODS: Four unidentified isolates were recovered in Walter Reed Canine Cells (WRCC) from respiratory, fecal and penile specimens. Physicochemical tests, electron microscopy, viral cultivation in human and animal cells, antibody neutralization assays, and recently the genome sequencing were used to characterize the isolates. Sera from these dogs and their cohorts were tested with the isolates to determine origin and prevalence of the infections. RESULTS: The viral isolates were small non-enveloped spherical RNA virions, 27 to 42 nm in diameter with cup-like structures, indicating they are caliciviruses. They propagated in WRCC and MDCK cells, not in either other canine cells or human and other animal cells. Each isolate is antigenically distinct and react with dog sera in respective cohorts. The genomes have nucleotide identities ranging from 70.3% to 90.7% and encode the non-structural polyprotein (1810 amino acids), major capsid protein (691 amino acids) and minor structural protein (134 amino acids). They belong to two different phylogenetic clades in Vesivirus genus with close relation with canine calicivirus (CaCV). CONCLUSIONS: These CaCV isolates have restricted cell tropism, antigenic diversity and genetic variation. Further investigation will shed light on antigenic relation to other vesiviruses, and its pathogenicity for dogs and potential infectivity to other animals. Together with the previously reported CaCV strains provides significant evidence to support the formation of a new CaCV species in the Vesivirus genus.

This study investigated the self‐reported sedentary time of Japanese workers during and after the first state of emergency (April 7 to May 25, 2020) and examined differences in sedentary time after starting work from home and according to job type. METHODS: We used cross‐sectional data from the Japan COVID‐19 and Society Internet Survey, a web‐based questionnaire survey conducted from August to September 2020 (n = 11,623; age range 15‐79 years; 63.6% male). Prolonged sedentary time was calculated by subtracting the sedentary time after the state of emergency (defined as the normal sedentary time) from that during the emergency, with adjustments using inverse probability weighting for being a respondent in an internet survey. RESULTS: An increase in sedentary time of at least 2 hours was reported by 12.8% of respondents who started working from home during the state of emergency, including 9.7% of salespersons and 7.7% of desk workers. After adjusting for potential confounders, the multivariate‐adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for a prolonged sedentary time ≥2 hours was significantly higher in respondents who started to work from home (OR: 2.14, 95% confidence interval: 1.78‐2.57), and certain job types (desk workers; OR: 1.56, 95% CI: 1.27‐1.91, salespersons; OR: 2.03, 95% CI: 1.64‐2.51).

674697,Assessment methods and the validity and reliability of measurement tools in online objective structured clinical examinations: a systematic scoping review,2021-06-01,"Background: Social distancing measures designed to contain the COVID-19 pandemic can explicitly and implicitly restrict physical activity, a particular concern for high-risk patient groups. Using a within-subjects design with objective measurement (via validated accelerometers), we assessed rheumatoid arthritis patients' physical activity and sedentary behavior levels prior to and during the social distancing measures implemented in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods: Post-menopausal women diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis were assessed before (from March 2018 to March 2020) and during (from 24th May to 7th July 2020) social distancing measures to contain COVID-19 pandemic, using a within-subjects, repeated-measure design. Physical activity and sedentary behavior were assessed using postural-based accelerometry (ActivPAL micro). Findings: Mean age was 60.9 years (95%CI: 58.0, 63.7) and BMI was 29.5 Kg/m2 (95%CI: 27.2, 31.9). Disease activity ranged from remission to moderate activity. Most of the patients were using disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs and prednisone. Hypertension and dyslipidemia were the most frequent comorbidities During social distancing, there were reductions in total stepping time (15.7% [-0.3 h/day, 95%CI: -0.4, -0.1; p=0.004]), in light-intensity activity (13.0% [-0.2 h/day, 95%CI: -0.4, -0.04; p=0.016]) and in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (38.8% [-4.5 min/day, 95%CI: -8.1, -0.9; p=0.015]), but no changes in total standing time or total sedentary time. However, time spent in prolonged bouts of sitting <30 min increased by 34% (1.0 h/day, 95%CI: 0.3, 1.7; p=0.006) and sitting bouts <60 min increased by 85% (1.0 h/day, 95%CI: 0.5, 1.6) Sit-stand transitions were reduced by 10% (-5.1/day, 95%CI: -10.3, 0.0; p=0.051). Conclusion: Imposed social distancing measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak were associated with decreased physical activity and increased prolonged sitting among rheumatoid arthritis patients. Since this has the potential to increase the burden of cardiovascular disease in such high-risk patients, attention to maintaining physical activity is an urgent consideration during the pandemic.","Pinto, A.

675960,Economic and health impacts of infectious diseases in China: A protocol for systematic review and meta analysis,2020-07-24,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are critical modulators of endothelial homeostasis, which highlights their involvement in vascular diseases, including those caused by virus infections. Our main objective was to identify miRNAs involved in the endothelial function and determine their expression in post-mortem lung biopsies of COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory injuries and thrombotic events. Based on functional enrichment analysis, miR-26a-5p, miR-29b-3p, and miR-34a-5p were identified as regulators of mRNA targets involved in endothelial and inflammatory signaling pathways, as well as viral diseases. A miRNA/mRNA network, constructed based on protein–protein interactions of the miRNA targets and the inflammatory biomarkers characterized in the patients, revealed a close interconnection of these miRNAs in association to the endothelial activation/dysfunction. Reduced expression levels of selected miRNAs were observed in the lung biopsies of COVID-19 patients (n = 9) compared to the Controls (n = 10) (P < 0.01-0.0001). MiR-26a-5p and miR-29b-3p presented the best power to discriminate these groups (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.8286, and AUC = 0.8125, respectively). The correlation analysis of the miRNAs with inflammatory biomarkers in the COVID-19 patients was significant for miR-26a-5p [IL-6 (r(2) = 0.5414), and ICAM-1 (r(2) = 0.5624)], and miR-29b-3p [IL-4 (r(2) = 0.8332) and IL-8 (r(2) = 0.2654)]. Altogether, these findings demonstrate the relevance and the non-random involvement of miR-26a-5p, miR-29b-3p, and miR-34a-5p in endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory response in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the occurrence of severe lung injury and immunothrombosis.","Centa, Ariana; Fonseca, Aline S.; da Silva Ferreira, Solange G.; Azevedo, Marina Luise V.; de Paula, Caroline Busatta V.; Nagashima, Seigo; Machado-Souza, Cleber; dos Santos Miggiolaro, Anna Flavia R.; Pellegrino Baena, Cristina; de Noronha, Lucia; Cavalli, Luciane R.",Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00457.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33651636/,446

680316,The effects of exercise on COVID-19 therapeutics: A protocol for systematic review and meta-analysis,2020-09-18,"INTRODUCTION: Preschool wheezers are at high risk of recurrent attacks triggered by respiratory viruses, sometimes exacerbated by exposure to allergens and pollution. Because of the COVID‐19 infection, the lockdown was introduced, but the effects on preschool wheezers are unknown. We hypothesized that there would be an improvement in outcomes during the lockdown, and these would be lost when the lockdown was eased. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients underwent medical visits before and after the COVID‐19 lockdown. We recorded the childhood Asthma Control Test (cACT) and a clinical questionnaire. Data on symptoms, the need for medications and the use of healthcare resources were recorded. We compared these data with retrospective reports from the preceding year and prospectively acquired questionnaires after lockdown. RESULTS: We studied 85 preschool wheezers, mean age 4.9 years. During the lockdown, cACT score was significantly higher (median 25 vs. 23); families reported a dramatic drop in wheezing episodes (51 vs. none), significant reductions in the day and nighttime symptoms, including episodes of shortness of breath (p < .0001); the use of salbutamol and oral corticosteroids (OCS) dropped significantly (p < .0001) and 79 (95%) patients needed no OCS bursts during the lockdown. Finally, patients had significantly fewer extra medical examinations, as well as fewer Emergency Room visits (p < .0001). All were improved compared with the same time period from the previous year, but outcomes worsened significantly again after lockdown (cACT median: 22). CONCLUSIONS: During the national lockdown, children with persistent preschool wheeze showed a significant clinical improvement with reduction of respiratory symptoms, medication use for exacerbations, and use of healthcare resources. This trend reversed when lockdown restrictions were eased.","Ullmann, Nicola; Allegorico, Annalisa; Bush, Andrew; Porcaro, Federica; Negro, Valentina; Onofri, Alessandro; Cherchi, Claudio; De Santis, Simone; Rosito, Lorenza; Cutrera, Renato",Pediatr Pulmonol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33852779/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ppul.25400,446

682685,Association between role conflict and ambiguity and stress among nurses in primary health care centers in Saudi Arabia during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic: A cross-sectional study,2021-09-17,"The medical authority in China, especially in Wuhan city, reported on December 2019 a large number of highly fatal, rapidly spreading viral pneumonia caused by an unknown coronavirus. The common history of all the patients was their visiting a Wuhan's whole food store, where live animals and seafood are sold. Irrespective of the efforts of the Chinese authorities, the virus spread rapidly all over the world by travelers, provoking widespread attention by the media and panic. Many previous coronavirus epidemics had been recorded, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the recently newly discovered epidemic is named coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). This disease is caused by SARS Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and this virus is antigenically related to the SARS virus (SARS-CoV), which had been detected in 2002, depending on clinical, serological, and molecular findings. There is rapid competition among the researchers to discover the source of the virus, understand the mechanism of the disease development, establish treatment strategies, and determine the factors affecting the incidence of infection and severity of the disease, and focus on the production of a vaccine. Coronaviruses are a group of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome viruses; its genome length varies from 26 to 32 kb. Coronavirus causes mild to severe respiratory disorders. In December 2019, several cases of pneumonia of unknown causes were found in Wuhan city, which is located in the Hubei province in China. Chinese health authorities investigated the problem and found that a new virus caused such infection and, using next-generation sequencing, found the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV). It has been transferred from humans to humans and animals to humans (zoonotic). Coronaviruses cause multiple respiratory problems, varying from common cold to severe infections such as SARS. General symptoms of infection include fatigue, cough, and breathing problems such as shortness of breath, as described by World Health Organization. Serious cases may result in pneumonia, renal failure, and even death. We address current information about the new SARS Coronavirus-2 as well as the COVID-19 disease caused by it in this review.","Swelum, Ayman A.; Shafi, Manal E.; Albaqami, Najah M.; El-Saadony, Mohamed T.; Elsify, Ahmed; Abdo, Mohamed; Taha, Ayman E.; Abdel-Moneim, Abdel-Moneim E.; Al-Gabri, Naif A.; Almaiman, Amer A.; Saleh Al-wajeeh, Abdullah; Tufarelli, Vincenzo; Staffa, Vito N.; Abd El-Hack, Mohamed E.",Front Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33102545/; https://doi.org/10.3389/fvets.2020.00578,446

Many colleges thus had to shift their education from personal to online form overnight. The educational environment itself has a significant influence on students’ learning outcomes, knowledge, and satisfaction. This study aims to validate the tool for assessing the educational environment in the Slovenian nursing student population. To assess the educational environment, we used the DREEM tool distributed among nursing students using an online platform. First, we translated the survey questionnaire from English into Slovenian using the reverse translation technique. We also validated the DREEM survey questionnaire. We performed psychometric testing and content validation. I-CVI and S-CVI are at an acceptable level. A high degree of internal consistency was present, as Cronbach’s alpha was 0.951. The questionnaire was completed by 174 participants, of whom 30 were men and 143 were women. One person did not define gender. The mean age of students was 21.1 years (SD = 3.96). The mean DREEM score was 122.2. The mean grade of student perception of learning was 58.54%, student perception of teachers was 65.68%, student academic self-perception was 61.88%, student perception of the atmosphere was 60.63%, and social self-perception of students was 58.93%.

684077,Inhibiting IL-6 in COVID-19: we are not sure,2020-07-27,"OBJECTIVES: To determine factors associated with COVID-19-related death in people with rheumatic diseases. METHODS: Physician-reported registry of adults with rheumatic disease and confirmed or presumptive COVID-19 (from 24 March to 1 July 2020). The primary outcome was COVID-19-related death. Age, sex, smoking status, comorbidities, rheumatic disease diagnosis, disease activity and medications were included as covariates in multivariable logistic regression models. Analyses were further stratified according to rheumatic disease category. RESULTS: Of 3729 patients (mean age 57 years, 68% female), 390 (10.5%) died. Independent factors associated with COVID-19-related death were age (66–75 years: OR 3.00, 95% CI 2.13 to 4.22; >75 years: 6.18, 4.47 to 8.53; both vs ≤65 years), male sex (1.46, 1.11 to 1.91), hypertension combined with cardiovascular disease (1.89, 1.31 to 2.73), chronic lung disease (1.68, 1.26 to 2.25) and prednisolone-equivalent dosage >10 mg/day (1.69, 1.18 to 2.41; vs no glucocorticoid intake). Moderate/high disease activity (vs remission/low disease activity) was associated with higher odds of death (1.87, 1.27 to 2.77). Rituximab (4.04, 2.32 to 7.03), sulfasalazine (3.60, 1.66 to 7.78), immunosuppressants (azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, ciclosporin, mycophenolate or tacrolimus: 2.22, 1.43 to 3.46) and not receiving any disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) (2.11, 1.48 to 3.01) were associated with higher odds of death, compared with methotrexate monotherapy. Other synthetic/biological DMARDs were not associated with COVID-19-related death. CONCLUSION: Among people with rheumatic disease, COVID-19-related death was associated with known general factors (older age, male sex and specific comorbidities) and disease-specific factors (disease activity and specific medications). The association with moderate/high disease activity highlights the importance of adequate disease control with DMARDs, preferably without increasing glucocorticoid dosages. Caution may be required with rituximab, sulfasalazine and some immunosuppressants.","Strangfeld, Anja; Schäfer, Martin; Gianfrancesco, Milena A; Lawson-Tovey, Saskia; Liew, Jean W; Ljung, Lotta; Mateus, Elsa F; Richez, Christophe; Santos, Maria J; Schmajuk, Gabriela; Scirè, Carlo A; Sirotich, Emily; Sparks, Jeffrey A; Sufka, Paul; Thomas, Thierry; Trupin, Laura; Wallace, Zachary S; Al-Adely, Sarah; Bachiller-Corral, Javier; Bhana, Suleman; Cacoub, Patrice; Carmona, Loreto; Costello, Ruth; Costello, Wendy; Gossec, Laure; Grainger, Rebecca; Hachulla, Eric; Hasseli, Rebecca; Hausmann, Jonathan S; Hyrich, Kimme L; Izadi, Zara; Jacobsohn, Lindsay; Katz, Patricia; Kearsley-Fleet, Lianne; Robinson, Philip C; Yazdany, Jinoos; Machado, Pedro M",Ann Rheum Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33504483/; https://doi.org/10.1136/annrheumdis-2020-219498,446
684182,Avian Influenza: Are We Ready?,2007-03-03,"As a city famous for tourism, the public healthcare system of Macau SAR has been under great pressure during the outbreak of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this study, we report clinical and microbiological features of ten COVID-19 patients enrolled in the Centro Hospitalar Conde de São Januário (CHCSJ) between January 21 to February 16, 2020. Clinical samples from all patients including nasopharyngeal swab (NPS)/sputum, urine, and feces were collected for serial virus RNA testing by standard qRT-PCR assay. In total, seven were imported cases and three were local cases. The median duration from Macau arrival to admission in imported cases was 3 days. Four patients required oxygen therapy but none of them needed machinal ventilation. No fatal cases were noted. The most common symptoms were fever (80%) and diarrhea (80%). In the ""Severe"" group, there was significantly more elderly patients (p=0.045), higher lactate dehydrogenase levels (p=0.002), and elevated C-Reactive protein levels compared to the ""Mild to Moderate"" group (p<0.001). There were positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA signals in all patients' NPS and stool specimens but negative in all urine specimens. Based on our data on SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in stool and the possibility of a lag in viral detection in NPS specimens, the assessment of both fecal and respiratory specimen is recommended to enhance diagnostic sensitivity, and also to aid discharge decision before the role of viral RNA shedding in stool is clarified.","Lo, Iek Long; Lio, Chon Fu; Cheong, Hou Hon; Lei, Chin Ion; Cheong, Tak Hong; Zhong, Xu; Tian, Yakun; Sin, Nin Ngan",Int J Biol Sci,https://doi.org/10.7150/ijbs.45357; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32226287/,446
685369,External validation of prognostic scores for COVID-19: a multicenter cohort study of patients hospitalized in Greater Paris University Hospitals,2021-09-28,"Abstract The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has infected more than 1900 humans, since 2012. The syndrome ranges from asymptomatic and mild cases to severe pneumonia and death. The virus is believed to be circulating in dromedary camels without notable symptoms since the 1980s. Therefore, dromedary camels are considered the only animal source of infection. Neither antiviral drugs nor vaccines are approved for veterinary or medical use despite active research on this area. Here, we developed four vaccine candidates against MERS-CoV based on ChAdOx1 and MVA viral vectors, two candidates per vector. All vaccines contained the full-length spike gene of MERS-CoV; ChAdOx1 MERS vaccines were produced with or without the leader sequence of the human tissue plasminogen activator gene (tPA) where MVA MERS vaccines were produced with tPA, but either the mH5 or F11 promoter driving expression of the spike gene. All vaccine candidates were evaluated in a mouse model in prime only or prime-boost regimens. ChAdOx1 MERS with tPA induced higher neutralising antibodies than ChAdOx1 MERS without tPA. A single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS with tPA elicited cellular immune responses as well as neutralising antibodies that were boosted to a significantly higher level by MVA MERS. The humoral immunogenicity of a single dose of ChAdOx1 MERS with tPA was equivalent to two doses of MVA MERS (also with tPA). MVA MERS with mH5 or F11 promoter induced similar antibody levels; however, F11 promoter enhanced the cellular immunogenicity of MVA MERS to significantly higher magnitudes. In conclusion, our study showed that MERS-CoV vaccine candidates could be optimized by utilising different viral vectors, various genetic designs of the vectors, or different regimens to increase immunogenicity. ChAdOx1 and MVA vectored vaccines have been safely evaluated in camels and humans and these MERS vaccine candidates should now be tested in camels and in clinical trials.","Alharbi, Naif Khalaf; Padron-Regalado, Eriko; Thompson, Craig P.; Kupke, Alexandra; Wells, Daniel; Sloan, Megan A.; Grehan, Keith; Temperton, Nigel; Lambe, Teresa; Warimwe, George; Becker, Stephan; Hill, Adrian V.S.; Gilbert, Sarah C.",Vaccine,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0264410X17306564; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X17306564; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28579232/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.vaccine.2017.05.032,446
685735,Assessing the need for transfer to the intensive care unit for Coronavirus-19 disease: Epidemiology and risk factors,2020-10-27,"BACKGROUND: One hundred days after SARS-CoV-2 was first reported in Vietnam on January 23(rd), 270 cases were confirmed, with no deaths. We describe the control measures used by the Government and their relationship with imported and domestically-acquired case numbers, with the aim of identifying the measures associated with successful SARS-CoV-2 control. METHODS: Clinical and demographic data on the first 270 SARS-CoV-2 infected cases and the timing and nature of Government control measures, including numbers of tests and quarantined individuals, were analysed. Apple and Google mobility data provided proxies for population movement. Serial intervals were calculated from 33 infector-infectee pairs and used to estimate the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission events and time-varying reproduction numbers. RESULTS: A national lockdown was implemented between April 1(st) and 22(nd). Around 200 000 people were quarantined and 266 122 RT-PCR tests conducted. Population mobility decreased progressively before lockdown. 60% (163/270) of cases were imported; 43% (89/208) of resolved infections remained asymptomatic for the duration of infection. The serial interval was 3·24 days, and 27·5% (95% confidence interval, 15·7%-40·0%) of transmissions occurred pre-symptomatically. Limited transmission amounted to a maximum reproduction number of 1·15 (95% confidence interval, 0·37-2·36). No community transmission has been detected since April 15(th). CONCLUSIONS: Vietnam has controlled SARS-CoV-2 spread through the early introduction of mass communication, meticulous contact-tracing with strict quarantine, and international travel restrictions. The value of these interventions is supported by the high proportion of asymptomatic and imported cases, and evidence for substantial pre-symptomatic transmission.","Pham, Quang Thai; Rabaa, Maia A; Duong, Huy Luong; Dang, Quang Tan; Tran, Dai Quang; Quach, Ha-Linh; Hoang, Ngoc-Anh Thi; Phung, Cong Dinh; Ngu, Duy Nghia; Tran, Anh Tu; La, Ngoc Quang; Tran, My Phuc; Vinh, Chau; Nguyen, Cong Khanh; Dang, Duc Anh; Tran, Nhu Duong; Thwaites, Guy; van Doorn, H Rogier; Choisy, Marc",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32738143/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa1130,446

687569,The prevalence of sleep disturbances among physicians and nurses facing the COVID-19 patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis,2020-09-29,"The COVID‐19 pandemic has created new challenges for instructors who seek high‐impact educational practices that can be facilitated online without creating excessive burdens with technology, grading, or enforcement of honor codes. These practices must also account for the possibility that some students may need to join courses asynchronously and have limited or unreliable connectivity. Of the American Association of Colleges and University's list of 11 high‐impact educational practices, writing‐intensive courses may be the easiest for science faculty to adopt during these difficult times. Not only can writing assignments promote conceptual learning, they can also deepen student engagement with the subject matter and with each other. Furthermore, writing assignments can be incredibly flexible in terms of how they are implemented online and can be designed to reduce the possibility of cheating and plagiarism. To accelerate the adoption of writing pedagogies, we summarize evidence‐based characteristics of effective writing assignments and offer a sample writing assignment from an introductory ecology course. We then suggest five strategies to help instructors manage their workload. Although the details of the sample assignment may be particular to our course, this framework is general enough to be adapted to most science courses, including those taught in‐person, those taught online, and those that must be able to switch quickly between the two.","Reynolds, Julie A.; Cai, Victor; Choi, Julia; Faller, Sarah; Hu, Meghan; Kozhumam, Arthi; Schwartzman, Jonathan; Vohra, Ananya",Ecol Evol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33230410/; https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.6776,446

In this retrospective cohort study, COVID‐19 (227) and non‐COVID‐19 patients (260) were divided into four groups according to their vitamin D levels: Group I (0–10 ng/ml), Group II (10–20 ng/ml), Group III (20–30 ng/ml), and Group IV (vitamin D > 30 ng/ml). Laboratory test results and the radiological findings were evaluated. In addition, for comparative purposes, medical records of 1200 patients who had a hospital visit in the November 1, 2019–November 1, 2020 period for complaints due to reasons not related to COVID‐19 were investigated for the availability of vitamin D measurements. This search yielded 260 patients with tested vitamin D levels. Vitamin D levels were below 30 ng/ml in 94.27% of 227 COVID‐19‐positive patients (average age, 46.32 ± 1.24 years [range, 20–80 years] and 56.54% women) while 93.07% of 260 non‐COVID‐19 patients (average age, 44.63 ± 1.30 years [range, 18–75 years] and 59.50% women) had vitamin D levels below 30 ng/ml. Nevertheless, very severe vitamin D deficiency (<10 ng/ml) was considerably more common in COVID‐19 patients (44%) (average age, 44.15 ± 1.89 years [range, 23–80 years] and 57.57% women) than in non‐COVID‐19 ones (31%) (average age, 46.50 ± 2.21 years [range, 20–75 years] and 62.5% women). Among COVID‐19‐positive patients, the group with vitamin D levels of >30 ng/ml had significantly lower D‐dimer and C‐reactive protein (CRP) levels, number levels, number of affected lung segments and shorter hospital stays. No difference was found among the groups in terms of age and gender distribution. Elevated vitamin D levels could decrease COVID‐19 PCR positivity, D‐dime and CRP levels and the number of affected lung segments in COVID‐19‐positive patients, thereby shortening the duration of hospital stays and alleviating the intensity of COVID‐19.","Demir, Mustafa; Demir, Fadime; Aygun, Hatice",J Med Virol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33512007/; https://doi.org/10.1002/jmv.26832,446
689008,The prevalence of invasive aspergillosis among COVID-19 intensive care unit patients: not so rare problem.,2021-07-05,"BACKGROUND: In patients intubated for mechanical ventilation, prolonged diaphragm inactivity could lead to weakness and poor outcome. Time to resume a minimal diaphragm activity may be related to sedation practice and patient severity. METHODS: Prospective observational study in critically ill patients. Diaphragm electrical activity (EAdi) was continuously recorded after intubation looking for resumption of a minimal level of diaphragm activity (beginning of the first 24 h period with median EAdi > 7 µV, a threshold based on literature and correlations with diaphragm thickening fraction). Recordings were collected until full spontaneous breathing, extubation, death or 120 h. A 1 h waveform recording was collected daily to identify reverse triggering. RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were enrolled and 69 analyzed (mean age ± standard deviation 63 ± 16 years). Reasons for ventilation were respiratory (55%), hemodynamic (19%) and neurologic (20%). Eight catheter disconnections occurred. The median time for resumption of EAdi was 22 h (interquartile range 0–50 h); 35/69 (51%) of patients resumed activity within 24 h while 4 had no recovery after 5 days. Late recovery was associated with use of sedative agents, cumulative doses of propofol and fentanyl, controlled ventilation and age (older patients receiving less sedation). Severity of illness, oxygenation, renal and hepatic function, reason for intubation were not associated with EAdi resumption. At least 20% of patients initiated EAdi with reverse triggering. CONCLUSION: Low levels of diaphragm electrical activity are common in the early course of mechanical ventilation: 50% of patients do not recover diaphragmatic activity within one day. Sedatives are the main factors accounting for this delay independently from lung or general severity. Trial Registration ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02434016). Registered on April 27, 2015.

METHODS: A prospective cohort study. Primary outcome was improvement at day 14 defined as alive, not on mechanical ventilation, and moderate, mild, or recovered from COVID-19. Antibody levels in CP units were unknown at the time of treatment. IgG against the spike protein S1 was subsequently measured by ELISA. Neutralizing antibodies titers were determined in a subset. Outcome was assessed in relation to the mean antibody level transfused to the patients (≤4.0 versus >4.0). FINDINGS: Of 49 patients, 11 (22.4%) had moderate, 38 (77.6%) had severe disease, 28 were ventilated. At day 14, 24 (49.0%) patients improved, 9 (18.4%) died, and 13 (26.5%) were ventilated. In 14/98 (14.3%) CP units IgG was < 1.1 (cutoff calibration) and in 60 (61.2%) ≤4.0. IgG level and neutralizing antibody titer were correlated (0.85 p < 0.001). In patients receiving ≤4.0 antibody levels, 11/30 improved (36.7%) versus 13/19 (68.4%) in patients receiving >4.0 odds ratio (OR) 0.267 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.079–0.905], P = 0.030. In patients diagnosed >10 days prior to treatment, 4/14 (22.4%) improved in the ≤4.0 antibody group, versus 6/7 (85.7%) in the >4.0 antibody group, OR 0.048 (95% CI, 0.004–0.520), P = 0.007. No serious adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: Treatment with CP with higher levels of IgG against S1 may benefit patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. IgG against S1 level in CP predicts neutralization antibodies titers.","Maor, Yasmin; Cohen, Daniel; Paran, Nir; Israely, Tomer; Ezra, Vered; Axelrod, Ofra; Shinar, Eilat; Izak, Marina; Rahav, Galia; Rahimi-Levene, Naomi; Bazofin, Baruch M; Gelman, Ram; Dicker, Dror; Brosh-Nissimov, Tal; Megged, Orli; Dahan, David; Benov, Avi; Paz, Alona; Edward, Kaykov; Moran, Amit; Rogowski, Ori; Sorkine, Patrick; Mayo, Ami; Zimhony, Oren; Chen, Jacob",EClinicalMedicine,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eclinm.2020.100525; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589537020302698; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32923991/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589537020302698,446
690054,Physical relaxation for occupational stress in healthcare workers: A systematic review and network meta‐analysis of randomized controlled trials,2021-07-07,"Background and Objective: Oral anticoagulation (OAC) for secondary stroke prevention is recommended in atrial fibrillation (AF) and other sources of cardioembolic stroke. Our objectives were to explore the differences in ischemic and hemorrhagic events when using OAC for secondary stroke prevention according to the type of anticoagulant treatment and to analyze the number and reasons for OAC switches during long-term follow-up. Methods: Ischemic stroke (IS) patients who were discharged on OAC for secondary stroke prevention from January 2014 to October 2017 were recruited in a prospective, multicenter, hospital-based registry. Follow-up at 3 months was scheduled at the outpatient clinic with subsequent annual phone interviews for 3 years. Patients were classified into three study groups according to OAC at discharge: Vitamin K antagonist (VKA), Factor Xa inhibitor (FXa), or direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI). We compared stroke recurrences, intracranial hemorrhage, major bleeding, and all-cause mortality during the follow-up. We recorded any switches in OAC and the main reasons for the change. Results: A total of 241 patients were included. An anticoagulant was indicated in the presence of a source of cardioembolic stroke in 240 patients (99.6%) and lupus plus antiphospholipid syndrome in one patient. Up to 86 patients (35.6%) were on OAC before the index stroke; in 71 (82.5%) of them, this was VKA. At hospital discharge, 105 were treated with FXa (43.8%), 96 with VKA (39.6%), and 40 with DTI (16.6%). The cumulative incidences at 3 years were 17% for stroke recurrence, 1.6% for intracranial hemorrhage, 4.9% for major hemorrhage, and 22.8% for all-cause mortality, with no differences among the OAC groups in any outcomes. During the follow-up, 40 OAC switches were recorded (63% of them to FXa), mostly due to stroke recurrence. Conclusion: Long-term OAC in secondary stroke prevention is associated with a lower frequency of bleeding complications than stroke recurrences. No differences between anticoagulant drugs were found in any of the analyzed outcomes. The main cause for OAC switch during follow-up was stroke recurrence.","Gutiérrez-Zúñiga, Raquel; Rigual, Ricardo; Torres-Iglesias, Gabriel; Sánchez-Velasco, Sara; Alonso de Leciñana, María; Masjuan, Jaime; Álvarez Velasco, Rodrigo; Navas, Inmaculada; Izquierdo-Esteban, Laura; Fernández-Ferro, José; Rodríguez-Pardo, Jorge; Ruiz-Ares, Gerardo; Zapata-Wainberg, Gustavo; Fuentes, Blanca; Díez-Tejedor, Exuperio",Front Neurol,https://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2020.575634; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33193025/,446
