Treatment of COVID-19 for patients with underlying ILD or sarcoidosis may include hospital admission, possible drug treatment, caution with steroids, and avoidance of mechanical ventilation in acute exacerbation of ILD. Patients with COVID-19 respiratory illness are at risk for developing ILD.","Southern, Brian",Cleveland Clinic journal of medicine,https://doi.org/10.3949/ccjm.87a.ccc026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32409436/,917

Understanding the complex rules that govern escape could inform therapeutic design. We modeled viral escape with machine learning algorithms originally developed for human natural language. We identified escape mutations as those that preserve viral infectivity but cause a virus to look different to the immune system, akin to word changes that preserve a sentence's grammaticality but change its meaning. With this approach, language models of influenza hemagglutinin, HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (HIV Env), and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Spike viral proteins can accurately predict structural escape patterns using sequence data alone. Our study represents a promising conceptual bridge between natural language and viral evolution.","Hie, Brian; Zhong, Ellen D; Berger, Bonnie; Bryson, Bryan",Science,https://doi.org/10.1126/science.abd7331; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33446556/,917

METHODS: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 24 individuals attending the Galway-Roscommon Mental Health Services with an ICD-10 diagnosis of an anxiety disorder at two-time points (six-months apart) to determine the impact of the Covid-19 restrictions on anxiety and depressive symptoms, social and occupational functioning and quality of life. RESULTS: No statistical difference in symptomatology was noted between the two time points in relation to anxiety symptoms as measured utilising psychometric rating scales (BAI, HARS) or utilising a Likert Scale. The greatest impact of COVID-19 at both time points related to social functioning and quality of life. Significant variability was noted for individual participants. Qualitative analysis noted social isolation, concern for the participants' future and increased difficulty managing anxiety with ongoing restrictions. CONCLUSIONS: No significant overall change in symptomatology or functioning over time was noted for individuals with pre-existing anxiety disorders. Variability was however demonstrated between individuals, with some individuals describing ongoing anxiety, social isolation and concern for their future. Identifying those with ongoing symptoms or distress and providing multidisciplinary support to this cohort is suggested.","Hennigan, K; McGovern, M; Plunkett, R; Costello, S; McDonald, C; Hallahan, B",Ir J Psychol Med,,917
395388,"Response by Sparr and Bieri to Letter Regarding Article, ""Infarction of the Splenium of the Corpus Callosum in the Age of COVID-19: A Snapshot in Time""",2020,"OBJECTIVES: To assess the prevalence of complicated appendicitis (including gangrene, abscess and perforation) after the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV epidemic and to identify the risk factors associated with complicated appendicitis. METHODS: Two groups were established in the study consisting of: one group for cases of acute appendicitis before the 2019-nCoV epidemic (before January 1, 2020; pre-epidemic group) and another group for those after the epidemic outbreak (after January 1, 2020; epidemic group). These two groups were compared in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics, prevalence of complicated appendicitis, and treatment intention. A multivariate analysis model using binary logistic regression was constructed. RESULTS: A total of 163 patients were included in this study, with 105 in the pre-epidemic group and 58 in the epidemic group. In the epidemic group, the interval from the onset of symptoms to admission was 65.0 h, which is significantly longer than the 17.3 h interval noted in the pre-epidemic group (P < 0.001). The prevalence of complicated appendicitis after the epidemic outbreak was significantly higher than before the outbreak (51.7% vs. 12.4%, P < 0.001). In addition, the epidemic group had a lower score of patient's intention to seek treatment than the pre-epidemic group (9.5 ± 2.7 vs. 3.4 ± 2.6, P < 0.001). Based on the multivariate analysis, the risk factors for complicated appendicitis included the time from symptoms onset to admission (OR = 1.075) and the patients' intention to receive treatment (OR = 0.541). CONCLUSION: Complicated appendicitis was more common in patients with acute appendicitis after the outbreak of the 2019-nCoV epidemic.","Gao, Zhiguang; Li, Min; Zhou, Huabin; Liang, Yuzhi; Zheng, Chao; Li, Suming; Zhang, Tao; Deng, Weijun",Asian J Surg,,917

Using an innovative approach, this study analyses the impacts of participation in a COVID-19 survey in Australia on subjective wellbeing through a survey experiment. At a population level, we find no evidence that participation impacts subjective wellbeing. However, this may not hold for those with mental health concerns and those living in financial insecurity.

512541,"Letter by Dhillon and Lenthall Regarding Article, ""Infarction of the Splenium of the Corpus Callosum in the Age of COVID-19: A Snapshot in Time""",2020,"A coordinated system of disease surveillance will be critical to effectively control the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic. Such systems enable rapid detection and mapping of epidemics and inform allocation of scarce prevention and intervention resources. Although many lower- and middle-income settings lack infrastructure for optimal disease surveillance, health and demographic surveillance systems (HDSS) provide a unique opportunity for epidemic monitoring. This protocol describes a surveillance program at the Africa Health Research Institute's Population Intervention Platform site in northern KwaZulu-Natal. The program leverages a longstanding HDSS in a rural, resource-limited setting with very high prevalence of HIV and tuberculosis to perform Covid-19 surveillance. Our primary aims include: describing the epidemiology of the Covid-19 epidemic in rural KwaZulu-Natal; determining the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak and non-pharmaceutical control interventions (NPI) on behaviour and wellbeing; determining the impact of HIV and tuberculosis on Covid-19 susceptibility; and using collected data to support the local public-sector health response. The program involves telephone-based interviews with over 20,000 households every four months, plus a sub-study calling 750 households every two weeks. Each call asks a household representative how the epidemic and NPI are affecting the household and conducts a Covid-19 risk screen for all resident members. Any individuals screening positive are invited to a clinical screen, potential test and referral to necessary care - conducted in-person near their home following careful risk minimization procedures. In this protocol we report the details of our cohort design, questionnaires, data and reporting structures, and standard operating procedures in hopes that our project can inform similar efforts elsewhere.","Siedner, Mark J; Harling, Guy; Derache, Anne; Smit, Theresa; Khoza, Thandeka; Gunda, Resign; Mngomezulu, Thobeka; Gareta, Dickman; Majozi, Nomathamsanqa; Ehlers, Eugene; Dreyer, Jaco; Nxumalo, Siyabonga; Dayi, Njabulo; Ording-Jesperson, Gregory; Ngwenya, Nothando; Wong, Emily; Iwuji, Collins; Shahmanesh, Maryam; Seeley, Janet; De Oliveira, Tulio; Ndung039,; u, Thumbi; Hanekom, Willem; Herbst, Kobus",Wellcome Open Res,,917

624311,Infarction of the Splenium of the Corpus Callosum in the Age of COVID-19: A Snapshot in Time,2020-07-20,"A hypothesis concerning the potential utility of surfactant supplementation for the treatment of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is proposed, along with a brief summary of the data in the literature supporting this idea. It is thought that surfactant, which is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for intratracheal administration to treat neonatal respiratory distress syndrome in infants, could benefit COVID-19-infected individuals by: (1) restoring surfactant damaged by lung infection and/or decreased due to the virus-induced death of the type II pneumocytes that produce it and (2) reducing surface tension to decrease the work of breathing and limit pulmonary edema. In addition, a constituent of surfactant, phosphatidylglycerol, could mitigate COVID-19-induced lung pathology by: (3) decreasing excessive innate immune system activation via its inhibition of toll-like receptor-2 and -4 activation by microbial components and cellular proteins released by damaged cells, thereby limiting inflammation and the resultant pulmonary edema, and (4) possibly blocking spread of the viral infection to non-infected cells in the lung. Therefore, it is suggested that surfactant preparations containing phosphatidylglycerol be tested for their ability to improve lung function in critically ill patients with COVID-19.","Bollag, Wendy B.; Gonzales, Joyce N.",Med Hypotheses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33254581/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0306987720320454; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306987720320454?v=s5; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mehy.2020.110277,917
