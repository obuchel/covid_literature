1726,1726,1726,"Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices Regarding Avian Influenza A (H7N9) Among Mobile Phone Users: A Survey in Zhejiang Province, China",21.007841,4.5539436,2015-02-04,"BACKGROUND: Understanding people’s knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding a new infectious disease is crucial to the prevention and control of it. Human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) was first identified on March 31, 2013 in China. Out of the total number of 134 cases confirmed from March to September 2013 in China, Zhejiang Province saw the greatest number (46 cases). OBJECTIVE: This study employed a mobile Internet survey to assess KAP regarding H7N9 among mobile phone users in Zhejiang Province. This study intended to examine KAP by region and the association between sociodemographic variables and KAP. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was designed by Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A cross-sectional survey was executed through a mobile Internet application platform of China Unicom in 5 regions in Zhejiang Province. Stratified and clustered sampling methods were applied and mobile phone users were invited to participate in the study voluntarily. RESULTS: A total of 9582 eligible mobile phone users participated in the survey with a response rate of 1.92% (9582/5,000,000). A total of 9105 valid responses (95.02%) were included for statistical analysis. Generally, more than three-quarters of the participants had some basic knowledge of H7N9 and held the attitude recommended by the Zhejiang CDC toward eating cooked poultry (77.55%, 7061/9105) and visiting a hospital at the occurrence of symptoms (78.51%, 7148/9105). Approximately half of the participants worried about contracting H7N9, and took preventive practices recommended by the Zhejiang CDC. But only 14.29% (1301/9105) of participants kept eating cooked poultry as usual. Although worry about H7N9 infection did not differ by region, Hangzhou saw the largest proportion of participants with knowledge of H7N9, which was probably because Hangzhou had the greatest number of H7N9 cases. KAP varied by some sociodemographic variables. Female participants were more likely to know about symptoms of H7N9 (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.08-1.61), to worry about contracting it (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.04-1.27), and to report their lives being influenced by it (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.15-1.41). They were also more likely to take the recommended precautions. Male participants and younger participants were less likely to comply with advocated protective practices. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that health education should be customized depending on sociodemographic variables to achieve more effective behavioral outcomes.","Gu, Hua; Jiang, Zhenggang; Chen, Bin; Zhang, Jueman (Mandy); Wang, Zhengting; Wang, Xinyi; Cai, Jian; Chen, Yongdi; Zheng, Dawei; Jiang, Jianmin",JMIR Mhealth Uhealth,318,1

METHODS: An anonymous cross-sectional online survey was distributed among HCWs and trainees who worked or volunteered at the Hajj 2015-2017 through their line managers, or by visiting their hospitals and healthcare centres in Makkah and Mina. Overseas HCWs who accompanied the pilgrims or those who work in foreign Hajj medical missions were excluded. Pearson’s χ(2) test was used to compare categorical variables and odds ratio (OR) was calculated by “risk estimate” statistics along with 95% confidence interval (95%CI). RESULTS: A total of 138 respondents aged 20 to 59 (median 25.6) years with a male to female ratio of 2.5:1 participated in the survey. Only 11.6% (16/138) participants reported receiving all three vaccines, 15.2% (21/138) did not receive any vaccine, 76.1% (105/138) received meningococcal, 68.1% (94/138) influenza and 13.8% (19/138) pneumococcal vaccine. Females were more likely to receive a vaccine than males (OR 3.6, 95%CI: 1.0-12.7, P < 0.05). Willingness to follow health authority’s recommendation was the main reason for receipt of vaccine (78.8%) while believing that they were up-to-date with vaccination (39.8%) was the prime reason for non-receipt. CONCLUSION: Some HCWs at Hajj miss out the compulsory and highly recommended vaccines; lack of awareness is a key barrier and authority’s advice is an important motivator. Health education followed by stringent measures may be required to improve their vaccination rate.","Badahdah, Al-Mamoon; Alfelali, Mohammad; Alqahtani, Amani S; Alsharif, Saeed; Barasheed, Osamah; Rashid, Harunor",World J Clin Cases,318,5

The analytic and simulation results predicted by the model are presented and discussed. The simulations show that using the variant coefficients results in a higher percentage of susceptible individuals and a lower percentage of removed individuals.

As such, real time control and prediction methods present a significant challenge. For diseases which spread through direct human interaction, (e.g., transferred from infected to susceptible individuals) the contagion process can be modeled on a social-contact network where individuals are represented as nodes, and contacts between individuals are represented as links. The model presented in this paper seeks to identify the infection pattern which depicts the current state of an ongoing outbreak. This is accomplished by inferring the most likely paths of infection through a contact network under the assumption of partially available infection data. The problem is formulated as a bi-linear integer program, and heuristic solution methods are developed based on sub-problems which can be solved much more efficiently. The heuristic performance is presented for a range of randomly generated networks and different levels of information. The model results, which include the most likely set of infection spreading contacts, can be used to provide insight into future epidemic outbreak patterns, and aid in the development of intervention strategies.","Fajardo, David; Gardner, Lauren M.",Netw Spat Econ,318,5

Relative abdominal size is inversely related to elongation, suggesting that relative clutch mass decreases with addition of abdominal body segments. Shape‐volume relationships contradict trends seen in comparisons among distantly related limbed and limbless squamates (lizards and snakes), in which snakes have relatively more abdominal volume. Comparison within a phylogenetically restricted group allows the identification of functional and ontogenetic factors potentially limiting reproductive output. In Bruchymeles, constraining factors include retention of anterior body segments bearing parasternal ribs, which prevents extension of the clutch anteriorly within the body, and reduction of allometry of abdominal segments, which provides extended series of uniformly‐sized vertebrae for limbless locomotion, but reduces the relative size of the abdomen. The latter trait is associated with overall size reduction, which affects relative egg‐size and packing. Factors constraining abdominal volume in this genus are probably common to other elongate lizards, a morphological group that has been rarely represented in comparative studies of life history.","Griffith, Hugh",J Zool (1987),318,5

The accelerating extinction rate of plant species and its effect on ecosystem functioning is a hotly debated topic in ecological research. Most research projects concerning the relationship between species diversity and productivity have been conducted in artificial plant communities, with only a few in natural ecosystems. In this study we examined the relationship between species diversity and above‐ground net primary productivity (ANPP) over two consecutive growth seasons (2004 and 2005) in a semi‐arid steppe ecosystem of northern China, that were subjected to different land uses. 2.. Land use affected the relationship between species diversity and ANPP in this semi‐arid steppe ecosystem. Exclusion of grazing without or with biomass removal by mowing increased ANPP, species richness and species diversity compared with free grazing; the effect was reflected mainly as enhanced importance of the perennial forbs functional group in terms of their relative contributions to ANPP, plant cover and plant abundance. 3.. Many mechanisms regulate the relationship between species diversity and productivity. Differential effects of anthropogenic activities on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning greatly complicate the analysis of such relationships. On grazing‐exclusion sites the relationship between ANPP and species richness can be best described as an exponential growth function (R (2) = 0·99, P < 0·001, n = 24); whereas on the free‐grazing site the relationship takes the form of exponential decay (R (2) = 0·96, P < 0·001, n = 24). Our study concludes that the mode and severity of disturbance are important factors for interpreting the relationship between species diversity and productivity in semi‐arid steppe ecosystems.","ZHOU, Z.; SUN, O.

Leadership style has generally been identified as a means of reducing burnout, yet it is unclear whether some leadership styles are more effective than others at mitigating burnout. Additionally, behavioral health care is provided in a variety of contexts and a leadership style employed in one context may not be effective in another. The purpose of this paper was to review the literature on leadership style and burnout in behavioral health care contexts to identify the different leadership styles and contexts in which the relationship between the two constructs was studied. Studies were categorized based on the leadership style, study design, research methods, and study context.

We performed a prospective randomized study to determine if the ORR of SBRT + IL-2 was greater than IL-2 monotherapy in patients with advanced melanoma. METHODS: Patients with MM who had adequate physiological reserve for IL-2 and at least one site suitable for SBRT were eligible. There was a 1:1 randomization to SBRT + IL-2 or IL-2 monotherapy. Patients received one or two doses of SBRT (20 Gy per fraction) with the last dose administered 3 days before starting the first cycle of IL-2. IL-2 (600,000 IU per kg via intravenous bolus infusion) was given every 8 hours for a maximum of 14 doses with a second cycle after a 2-week rest. Responding patients received up to six IL-2 cycles. Patients assigned to IL-2 monotherapy who exhibited progression of melanoma after cycle 2 were allowed to crossover and receive SBRT and additional IL-2. Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1 criteria were applied to non-irradiated lesions for response assessment. RESULTS: 44 patients were included in the analysis. The ORR in the SBRT + IL-2 group was 54%: 21% complete response (CR), 33% partial response (PR), 21% stable disease (SD) and 25% progressive disease (PD). The ORR in patients receiving IL-2 monotherapy was 35%: 15% CR, 20% PR, 25% SD and 40% PD. Seven patients assigned to IL-2 subsequently received SBRT + IL-2. One CR and two PRs were observed in the crossover group. There was no difference in progression-free or overall survival (OS). At 5 years the OS was 26% in the SBRT + IL-2 group and 25% in the IL-2 monotherapy group. The disease control rate (DCR) was higher in the SBRT + IL-2 group (75% vs 60%, p=0.34). CONCLUSIONS: SBRT + IL-2 induced more objective responses with a higher DCR compared to IL-2 monotherapy in MM. IL-2 monotherapy resulted in a significantly higher ORR than anticipated. Some patients in the crossover group also achieved objective responses.

METHODS: We calculated the incidence of AWE and reviewed all the patients underwent surgical removal of Post-CS AWE during the period of 2012–2018 who were diagnosed, treated and followed up for 2–8 years at our tertiary hospital. RESULTS: Thirty women with AWE were included. The main symptom in 2/3 of cases was cyclic pain and 4 cases (13.3%) had no symptoms. The mean interval between prior CS and appearance of symptoms was 55.2 months and the mean size of the excised mass was 42 mm. Free surgical margin was less than 9 mm in 9 patients (30%) but no recurrence was recorded among all the studied patients. Pre-operative FNAC diagnosis was performed for only 3 patients (10%) which helped in excluding other potential pathologies. The clinical–pathological agreement value for detection of the nature of the abdominal wall mass was 93.4%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with suspected AWE should undergo preoperative cytological biopsy to exclude alternative diagnosis. Wide surgical excision with margin of less than 1 cm could be accepted especially in case of weak abdominal wall.

In contrast to other tumor indications, objective response rates to single-agent PD-1/PD-L1 blockade in ovarian cancer are limited, suggesting a need to identify combinatorial approaches that lead to tumor regression in a setting where checkpoint blockade alone is ineffective. Using a pre-clinical model of aggressive intraperitoneal ovarian cancer, we have previously reported on a heterologous prime/boost cancer vaccine that elicits robust anti-tumor immunity, prolongs survival of tumor-bearing mice, and which is further improved when combined with checkpoint blockade. As tumor control in this model is CD8 + T cell dependent, we reasoned that the prime/boost vaccine platform could be used to explore additional treatment combinations intended to bolster the effects of CD8 + T cells. Using whole tumor transcriptomic data, we identified candidate therapeutic targets anticipated to rationally combine with prime/boost vaccination. In the context of a highly effective cancer vaccine, CD27 agonism or antibody-mediated depletion of granulocytic cells each modestly increased tumor control following vaccination, with anti-PD-1 therapy further improving treatment efficacy. These findings support the use of immunotherapies with well-defined mechanisms(s) of action as a valuable platform for identifying candidate combination approaches for further therapeutic testing in ovarian cancer.

However, there is a paucity of data on genetic relatedness and diversity of the Vibrio cholerae isolates responsible for these outbreaks. Understanding whether the outbreaks are seeded from existing local isolates or if the outbreaks represent separate transmission events can inform public health decisions. RESULTS: Seventy-two V. cholerae isolates from outbreaks in 2009/2010, 2016, and 2017/2018 in Zambia were characterized using multilocus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) and whole genome sequencing (WGS). The isolates had eight distinct MLVA genotypes that clustered into three MLVA clonal complexes (CCs). Each CC contained isolates from only one outbreak. The results from WGS revealed both clustered and dispersed single nucleotide variants. The genetic relatedness of isolates based on WGS was consistent with the MLVA, each CC was a distinct genetic lineage and had nearest neighbors from other East African countries. In Lusaka, isolates from the same outbreak were more closely related to themselves and isolates from other countries than to isolates from other outbreaks in other years. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations are consistent with i) the presence of random mutation and alternative mechanisms of nucleotide variation, and ii) three separate transmission events of V. cholerae into Lusaka, Zambia. We suggest that locally, case-area targeted invention strategies and regionally, well-coordinated plans be in place to effectively control future cholera outbreaks.

A set of target-specific fluorescence-activable SPs are designed, which allows establishment of a novel multiplexed LAMP strategy for simultaneous detection of multiple cDNA targets. The digital multiplexed LAMP assay is thus developed by implementing the LAMP reaction using a droplet microfluidic chip coupled to a droplet counting microwell chip. The droplet counting system allows rapid and accurate counting of the numbers of total droplets and the positive droplets by collecting multi-color fluorescence images of the droplets in a microwell. The multiplexed dLAMP assay was successfully demonstrated for the quantification of HCV and HIV cDNA with high precision and detection limits as low as 4 copies per reaction. We also verified its potential for simultaneous digital assay of HCV and HIV RNA in clinical plasma samples.

In this system, the microneedle (MN) was inserted at 66° to the skin by TMICS so that the MN length could be extended within a safe range of skin penetration. Moreover, TMICS incorporating three MN patches created reliable ISF collecting conditions by penetrating the skin at consistent angle and force, 4.9 N. Due to the MN length increase and the patch number expansion, the surface area of the penetrated tissue was increased, thereby confirming that ISF extraction efficiency was improved. Skin ISF was collected into the paper reservoir on the patch, and the absorbed area was converted into a volume. ISF extraction from the rat skin in vivo by TMICS was well tolerated, and the 2.9 μL of ISF was obtained within 30 s.

Fifty consecutive adolescents (12–17 years) of both genders with obesity will be recruited among the patients hospitalized in a clinical center for obesity rehabilitation and randomly allocated into two experimental conditions: ACT + TAU vs. TAU only. Both groups will attend a three-week in-hospital multidisciplinary rehabilitation program for weight loss. The ACT + TAU condition comprises a psychological intervention based on ACT combined with a standard psychological assessment and support to the hospitalization. The TAU comprises the standard psychological assessment and support to the hospitalization. At pre- to post-psychological intervention, participants will complete the Avoidance and Fusion Questionnaire for Youth, the Psychological Well-Being Scale, the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, and the Emotional Eating subscale of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire to assess psychological well-being as the primary outcome and experiential avoidance, psychological distress, emotional dysregulation, and emotional eating as secondary outcomes. Repeated-measures ANOVAs (2 × 2) will be conducted. The study will assess the effectiveness of a brief ACT-based intervention for adolescents with obesity in improving their psychological conditions by targeting specific core processes of the ACT framework (openness, awareness, and engagement).

Through a sequential program of research, the Loop Research Collaborative developed a web-based, asynchronous clinical communication system for team-based care. Loop assembles the circle of care centered on a patient, in private networking spaces called Patient Loops. The patient, their caregiver, or both are part of the Patient Loop. The communication is threaded, it can be filtered and sorted in multiple ways, it is securely stored, and can be exported for upload to a medical record. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to implement and evaluate Loop. The study reporting adheres to the Standards for Reporting Implementation Research. METHODS: The study was a hybrid type II mixed methods design to simultaneously evaluate Loop’s clinical and implementation effectiveness, and implementation barriers and facilitators in 6 health care sites. Data included monthly user check-in interviews and bimonthly surveys to capture patient or caregiver experience of continuity of care, in-depth interviews to explore barriers and facilitators based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), and Loop usage extracted directly from the Loop system. RESULTS: We recruited 25 initiating health care providers across 6 sites who then identified patients or caregivers for recruitment. Of 147 patient or caregiver participants who were assessed and met screening criteria, 57 consented and 52 were enrolled on Loop, creating 52 Patient Loops. Across all Patient Loops, 96 additional health care providers consented to join the Loop teams. Loop usage was followed for up to 8 months. The median number of messages exchanged per team was 1 (range 0-28). The monthly check-in and CFIR interviews showed that although participants acknowledged that Loop could potentially fill a gap, existing modes of communication, workflows, incentives, and the lack of integration with the hospital electronic medical records and patient portals were barriers to its adoption. While participants acknowledged Loop’s potential value for engaging the patient and caregiver, and for improving communication within the patient’s circle of care, Loop’s relative advantage was not realized during the study and there was insufficient tension for change. Missing data limited the analysis of continuity of care. CONCLUSIONS: Fundamental structural and implementation challenges persist toward realizing Loop’s potential as a shared system of asynchronous communication. Barriers include health information system integration; system, organizational, and individual tension for change; and a fee structure for health care provider compensation for asynchronous communication.","Husain, Amna; Cohen, Eyal; Dubrowski, Raluca; Jamieson, Trevor; Kurahashi, Allison Miyoshi; Lokuge, Bhadra; Rapoport, Adam; Saunders, Stephanie; Stasiulis, Elaine; Stinson, Jennifer; Subramaniam, Saranjah; Wegier, Pete; Barwick, Melanie",J Med Internet Res,318,17

However, the majority of patients find weight loss a significant challenge. We identified factors associated with engagement and adherence to a low-energy diet (LED) as a treatment option for NAFLD. DESIGN: 23 patients with NAFLD enrolled in a LED (~800 kcal/day) were individually interviewed. Transcripts were thematically analysed. RESULTS: 14/23 patients achieved ≥10% weight loss, 18/23 achieved ≥7% weight loss and 19/23 achieved ≥5% weight loss. Six themes were generated from the data. A desire to achieve rapid weight loss to improve liver health and prevent disease progression was the most salient facilitator to engagement. Early and significant weight loss, accountability to clinicians and regular appointments with personalised feedback were facilitators to engagement and adherence. The desire to receive positive reinforcement from a consultant was a frequently reported facilitator to adherence. Practical and emotional support from friends and family members was critically important outside of the clinical setting. Irregular working patterns preventing attendance at appointments was a barrier to adherence and completion of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: Engagement and adherence to a LED in patients with NAFLD were encouraged by early and rapid weight loss, personalised feedback and positive reinforcement in the clinical setting combined with ongoing support from friends and family members. Findings support those identified in patients who completed a LED to achieve type 2 diabetes remission and highlight the importance of behaviour change support during the early stages of a LED to promote adherence.","Scragg, Jadine; Hallsworth, Kate; Taylor, Guy; Cassidy, Sophie; Haigh, Laura; Boyle, Marie; Anstee, Quentin; McPherson, Stuart; Avery, Leah",BMJ Open Gastroenterol,318,5

In the present study, we investigated whether communication between mitochondria and the endoplasmic reticulum contributes to cardiomyocyte death after myocardial infarction. Our data demonstrated that hypoxia treatment (mimicking myocardial infarction) promoted cardiomyocyte death by inducing the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway. The activation of JNK under hypoxic conditions was dependent on overproduction of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) in cardiomyocytes, and mitochondrial division was identified as the upstream inducer of mtROS overproduction. Silencing mitochondrial division activators, such as B cell receptor associated protein 31 (BAP31) and mitochondrial fission 1 (Fis1), repressed mitochondrial division, thereby inhibiting mtROS overproduction and preventing JNK-induced cardiomyocyte death under hypoxic conditions. These data revealed that a novel death-inducing mechanism involving the BAP31/Fis1/mtROS/JNK axis promotes hypoxia-induced cardiomyocyte damage. Considering that BAP31 is localized within the endoplasmic reticulum and Fis1 is localized in mitochondria, abnormal mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum communication may be a useful therapeutic target after myocardial infarction.","Cheng, Degang; Zheng, Jia; Hu, Fang; Lv, Wei; Lu, Chengzhi",Front Physiol,318,5

In these devices, named as ‘nanomechanical biosensors,’ a biomolecular interaction produces a change in the mechanical behavior of the transducer (a movement at nanometer scale), which can be measured and analyzed in real time. Microcantilevers translate the molecular recognition of biomolecules into a nanomechanical motion that is commonly coupled to an optical read-out system. This chapter discusses the main aspects regarding the physics of microcantilever as well the optical read-out techniques. It reviews the state-of-the-art, and discusses the prospective future directions of this new family of biosensors. Nanomechanical sensors are derived from the microfabricated cantilevers used in atomic force microscopy (AFM) and are based on the bending or resonance change induced in the cantilever when a biomolecular interaction takes place on one of its surfaces. The cantilever response depends on its mechanical properties, which are determined mainly by their spring constant and resonance frequency. Both parameters depend on the cantilever material and its geometry. The increasing number of applications of microcantilevers as biosensors has established these systems as a versatile platform for real-time and in situmeasurements of physical, chemical, and biochemical interactions. Further research is banked upon to provide information for increasing the biosensor sensitivity.","Alvarez, Mar; Zinoviev, Kirill; Moreno, Miguel; Lechuga, Laura M.",Optical Biosensors,318,5

Some patients develop recurrent BSIs. We evaluated the impacts of early recurrent BSIs (ER-BSIs) on outcomes in LDLT recipients. LDLT cases between 2008 and 2016 were included. Early BSI (E-BSI) was defined as a BSI event that occurred within 2 months after LDLT. ER-BSIs were defined as new-onset BSIs within 2 months due to another pathogen at a ≥ 48-h interval or a relapse of BSIs by the same pathogen at a ≥ 1-week interval, with negative cultures in between. The primary objective was evaluating the all-cause mortality of each group of LDLT recipients (90 days and 1 year). The secondary objectives were analyzing associated factors of each all-cause mortality and risk factors for early single BSI and ER-BSI. Among 727 LDLT recipients, 108 patients experienced 149 events of E-BSI with 170 isolated pathogens. Twenty-eight patients (25.9%, 28/108) experienced ER-BSI. The 1-year survival rates of patients without BSI, with early single BSI event, and with ER-BSIs were 92.4%, 81.3%, and 28.6%, respectively. ER-BSI was the most significant risk factor for 1-year mortality (adjusted HR = 5.31; 95% CI = 2.27–12.40). Intra-abdominal and/or biliary complications and early allograft dysfunction were risk factors for both early single BSI and ER-BSI. Interestingly, longer cold ischemic time and recipient operative time were associated with ER-BSI. LDLT recipients with ER-BSI showed very low survival rates accompanied by intra-abdominal complications. Clinicians should prevent BSI recurrence by being aware of intra-abdominal complications.

U-ACHIEVE is one of two phase 3 induction trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of the selective Janus kinase–1 inhibitor upadacitinib (UPA) 45 mg once daily (QD) in adults with UC. METHODS: U-ACHIEVE is a multicentre, double-blind, placebo (PBO)–controlled trial (NCT02819635) that randomized patients with moderately to severely active UC 2:1 to UPA 45 mg QD or PBO for 8 weeks. Patients were stratified by response to biologic therapy (inadequate vs non–inadequate responder), baseline corticosteroid use (yes or no), and baseline adapted Mayo score (≤7 or >7). The primary endpoint was proportion of patients achieving clinical remission (per adapted Mayo Score) at week 8.Ranked secondary endpoints included endoscopic improvement, endoscopic remission, and clinical response per adapted Mayo Score at week 8; clinical response per partial adapted Mayo Score at week 2; and histologic-endoscopic mucosal improvement at week 8. Non-responder imputation incorporating multiple imputations for missing data due to COVID-19 are reported. Safety was assessed through week 8. RESULTS: 474 patients were randomized (UPA, n=319; PBO, n=155). Baseline characteristics were well balanced between groups (Table 1). A significantly higher proportion of patients receiving UPA (26.1%) vs PBO (4.8%) achieved clinical remission at week 8 (adjusted treatment difference [95% CI], 21.6% [15.8, 27.(4)]; P<0.001; Figure 1). For all ranked secondary endpoints, UPA was superior to PBO (P<0.001; Figure 1). A significant difference in clinical response favouring UPA vs PBO was seen as early as week 2 (60.1% vs 27.3%) and was sustained over 8 weeks (79.0% vs 41.6%; Figure 2). There were more serious adverse events (AEs), severe AEs, and AEs leading to study drug discontinuation with PBO (Table 2). The most common AEs were acne, creatine phosphokinase elevation, and nasopharyngitis with UPA and worsening of UC and anaemia with PBO. Incidence of serious infection was similar between UPA and PBO. Neutropenia and lymphopenia were reported more frequently with UPA vs PBO (Table 2).No adjudicated gastrointestinal perforation, major cardiovascular AEs, or thrombotic events and no active tuberculosis, malignancy, or deaths were reported.

Meta-analyses have historically been extremely useful to determine treatment efficacy but recent debates about the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 patients resulted in contradictory meta-analytical results. Different factors during the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted key features of conducting a good meta-analysis. Some meta-analyses did not evaluate or treat substantial heterogeneity (I(2) > 75%); others did not include additional analysis for publication bias; none checked for evidence of p–hacking in the primary studies nor used recent methods (i.e., p-curve or p-uniform) to estimate the average population-size effect. These inconsistencies may contribute to contradictory results in the research evaluating COVID-19 treatments. A prominent example of this is the use of hydroxychloroquine, where some studies reported a large positive effect, whereas others indicated no significant effect or even increased mortality when hydroxychloroquine was used with the antibiotic azithromycin. In this paper, we first recall the benefits and fundamental steps of good quality meta-analysis. Then, we examine various meta-analyses on hydroxychloroquine treatments for COVID-19 patients that led to contradictory results and causes for this discrepancy. We then highlight recent tools that contribute to evaluate publication bias and p-hacking (i.e., p-curve, p-uniform) and conclude by making technical recommendations that meta-analyses should follow even during extreme global events such as a pandemic.","Boudesseul, Jordane; Zerhouni, Oulmann; Harbert, Allie; Rubinos, Clio",Front Public Health,318,26

Neurologists must weigh up the need to start or continue disease-modifying treatments against the risk of infection, the risk of complications from the infection, and the risk of multiple sclerosis activity. Since this is an unprecedented situation, most decisions are being made on the basis of a theoretical approach and the criteria of each neurologist. AIMS The aim of this study is conduct a literature search to collect available evidence on the relationship between disease-modifying therapies in multiple sclerosis and SARS-CoV-2 infection. This evidence, together with the experience of the authors in the management of patients with multiple sclerosis during the pandemic, will make it possible to offer some proposals for the treatment and follow-up of patients in this epidemiological context. DEVELOPMENT After the literature search and our experience in the management of patients, a number of proposals for treatment are established for each drug, which must necessarily be individualised for each patient, since, in these exceptional circumstances, their peculiarities can affect the prognosis.

Underpowering and lack of reproducibility due to small sample sizes have weakened conclusions of these investigations. In other disciplines, such as neuroeconomics and social sciences, crowdsourcing has been extensively utilized as a data collection tool, and a means to increase sample sizes. Recent methodological advances allow scientists, for the first time, to test online more complex cognitive, perceptual, and motor tasks. Here we review the nascent literature on the use of online crowdsourcing in cognitive and human systems neuroscience. These investigations take advantage of the ability to reliably track the activity of a participant's computer keyboard, mouse, and eye gaze in the context of large-scale studies online that involve diverse research participant pools. Crowdsourcing allows for testing the generalizability of behavioral hypotheses in real-life environments that are less accessible to lab-designed investigations. Crowdsourcing is further useful when in-laboratory studies are limited, for example during the current COVID-19 pandemic. We also discuss current limitations of crowdsourcing research, and suggest pathways to address them. We conclude that online crowdsourcing is likely to widen the scope and strengthen conclusions of cognitive and human systems neuroscience investigations.","Johnson, Brian P; Dayan, Eran; Censor, Nitzan; Cohen, Leonardo G","The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and psychiatry",318,20

Pooled (stratified) incidence of venous thromboembolism with 95% confidence intervals was estimated using the DerSimonian–Laird procedure for random effects meta-analysis. A bootstrap analysis was performed to examine between-modality differences. RESULTS Twelve randomized controlled trials and 19 case series investigating endovenous thermal ablation (radio frequency ablation with VNUS/Covidien ClosureFAST™ catheter only, endovenous laser ablation, or both) were included. Data from 12 randomized controlled trials and 6 case series investigating nonproprietary foam preparations were analyzed.

Reports on the presence of viral aerosols in indoor air are scarce, however, despite the fact that viruses are probably the most common cause of infection acquired indoor. OBJECTIVE This review discusses the most common respiratory (influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, and enteroviruses) and gastrointestinal (noroviruses) viral pathogens which can be easily transmitted in indoor environments. RESULTS The vast majority of studies reviewed here concern hospital and other health facilities where viruses are a well-known cause of occupational and nosocomial infections. Studies on other indoor environments, on the other hand, including homes, nonindustrial workplaces and public buildings, are scarce. CONCLUSIONS The lack of regulations, threshold values and standardized detection methods for viruses in indoor environments, make both research and interpretation of results difficult in this field, hampering infection control efforts. Further research will be needed to achieve a better understanding of virus survival in aerosols and on surfaces, and to elucidate the relationship between viruses and indoor environmental characteristics.","La Rosa, Giuseppina; Fratini, Marta; Della Libera, Simonetta; Iaconelli, Marcello; Muscillo, Michele",Annali dell'Istituto superiore di sanita,318,1

The aim of this study was to determine if EVSS could be considered as safe and effective as the more convention ML of the inferior mesenteric vessels division during elective laparoscopic left colectomy. METHODS Between 2001 and 2014, 200 consecutive patients (111 males) of mean age 54.1 years were operated laparoscopically for a symptomatic sigmoid diverticulitis. Vascular interruptions were performed using mechanical ligatures including double clipping, staples or surgical thread (100 patients) or, starting from 2006, with EVSS thereafter (100 patients). Section of the inferior mesenteric artery is performed systematically at its origin in our institution for teaching purposes. Technical results were prospectively collected perioperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS There was no mortality. Mean operating time was 253.7 and 200.7 min in the ML and EVSS groups, respectively (p < 0.001). Mean hospital stay was 10.4 and 8.1 days (p < 0.001). Thirty-day complications occurred in 31 versus 25 % of patients (p = 0.26). Leakage with peritonitis occurred in 3 patients in the ML group. Hemorrhagic events occurred in both groups (2 in ML group versus 1 in EVSS group). Limitations of the study are its retrospective design and the bias due to the comparison of two historical cohorts. CONCLUSIONS EVSS for the inferior mesenteric artery are as safe and effective as ML in elective sigmoidectomy for diverticular disease with lower operative time and hospital stay.","Trilling, Bertrand; Riboud, Romain; Abba, Julio; Girard, Edouard; Faucheron, Jean-Luc",International journal of colorectal disease,318,1

Information regarding co-infection of SARS-CoV-2 with vector-borne diseases (malaria and dengue) is crucial especially for the countries wherein malaria and dengue are endemic. The objective was to study the prevalence, demographic, clinical presentations among HCWs with COVID-19 and to compare the viral clearance in HCWs with COVID-19 and co-infection of malaria and dengue. METHODS This retrospective study was conducted at a dedicated COVID-19 hospital, BYL Nair Charitable Hospital (NH), Mumbai, India 6th April to 31st October 2020. The SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs was confirmed by RT-PCR. Out of 491 HCWs infected with SARS-CoV-2, analysis of viral clearance was carried out in 467 HCWs over seven month periods. RESULTS The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs was 13% (491 out of 3711). Out of the HCWs with COVID-19, prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher among security guards (25%) with 1% mortality. The co-infection of malaria or dengue was reported in 31 HCWs (6.3%). The mean duration of virus clearance was longer (12 days) in symptomatic HCWs as compared to asymptomatic (8 days, p<0.005). The recovery of SARS-CoV-2 infection in HCWs was faster (mean 8 days) with co-infection of malaria than without malaria (p<0.005). CONCLUSION We recommend universal testing of HCWs, to optimize staffing levels during the current pandemic as HCWs are the most precious resource.

Considering that definition of factors that influence deceased donor kidney transplant outcomes is important for allocation policies, as well as for individualization of post-transplant care, the purpose of this study was determine the risks for death censored graft survival and for patient survival conferred by older age of the donor in the context of the age of the recipient and of risk factors for graft and/or patient survival. The investigation was conducted in a single-center cohort of 5,359 consecutive first kidney transplants with adult deceased donors performed on non-prioritized adult recipients from January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2017. Death censored graft survival and patient survival were lower in older donors, whereas graft survival was higher and patient survival was lower in old recipients. The analyses of combinations of donor and recipient ages showed that death censored graft survival was lower in younger recipients in transplants from 18 to 59-year old donors, with standard or extended criteria, but no difference in graft survival was observed between younger and older recipients when the donor was ≥ 60-year old. Patient survival was higher in younger recipients in transplants with younger or older donors. Two to six HLA-A,B,DR mismatches, when compared to 0-1 MM, conferred risk for death-censored graft survival only in transplants from younger donors to younger recipients. Pre-transplant diabetes conferred risk for patient survival only in 50-59-year old recipients, irrespectively, of the age of the donor. Time on dialysis ≥ 10 years was a risk factor for patient survival in transplants with all donor-recipient age combinations, except in recipients with ≥ 60 years that received a kidney from an 18-49-year old donor. In conclusion, the results obtained in this study underline the importance of analyzing the impact of the age of the donor taking into consideration different scenarios.","Gerbase-DeLima, Maria; de Marco, Renato; Monteiro, Franscisco; Tedesco-Silva, Hélio; Medina-Pestana, José O; Mine, Karina L",Frontiers in immunology,318,1

METHODS A prospective imaging study was performed on 82 eyes of 43 patients with high myopia (>27 mm of axial length) with a clinical diagnosis of staphyloma. Three-dimensional MRI scans were acquired while subjects gazed in five directions (primary, nasal, temporal, superior and inferior). Surface renderings were generated, and a processing pipeline was created to automate alignment of the eye and to measure VCAV within 5.5 mm of the visual axis for each eye in every gaze. The degree of gaze-induced globe deformation was determined by calculating the Dice coefficient to assess the degree of overlap of the sclera at each eccentric gaze with that found in primary gaze. Each eccentric gaze VCAV was compared to VCAV in primary gaze using a fixed-effects regression allowing for subject-specific and eye-specific effects. RESULTS The Dice coefficient showed significant gaze-induced eye shape changes in all gazes (all p<0.0001). There were no statistically significant gaze-induced VCAV changes when comparing primary gaze to nasal, temporal or upgaze. However, when changing from primary to downgaze, VCAV was increased by +4.79 mm3 (p=0.002, 95% CI 1.71 to 7.86). CONCLUSION Significant gaze-induced globe deformation was noted in all gazes, but a reversible, instantaneous VCAV increase occurred only in downgaze, which is consistent with studies supporting the association of environmental factors such as near work with myopia development and progression.","Hoang, Quan V; Chang, Stanley; Yu, Daryle Jason Go; Yannuzzi, Lawrence A; Freund, K Bailey; Grinband, Jack",The British journal of ophthalmology,318,1

We evaluated a surgical coaching program by analyzing quantitative and qualitative data on surgeons' intraoperative performance. METHODS In the 2018-2019 Surgical Coaching for Operative Performance Enhancement (SCOPE) program, 46 practicing surgeons in multiple specialties at four academic medical centers were recruited to complete three peer coaching sessions, each comprising preoperative goal-setting, intraoperative observation, and postoperative debriefing. Coach and coachee rated the coachee's performance using modified Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS, range 1-5) and Non-Technical Skills for Surgeons (NOTSS, range 4-16). We used generalized estimating equations to evaluate trends in skill ratings over time, adjusting for case difficulty, clinical experience, and coaching role. Upon program completion, we analyzed semi-structured interviews with individual participants regarding the perceived impact of coaching on their practice. RESULTS Eleven of 23 coachees (48%) completed three coaching sessions, three (13%) completed two sessions, and six (26%) completed one session. Adjusted mean OSATS ratings did not vary over three coaching sessions (4.39 vs 4.52 vs 4.44, respectively; P = 0.655). Adjusted mean total NOTSS ratings also did not vary over three coaching sessions (15.05 vs 15.50 vs 15.08, respectively; P = 0.529). Regarding patient care, participants self-reported improved teamwork skills, communication skills, and awareness in and outside the operating room. Participants acknowledged the potential for coaching to improve burnout due to reduced intraoperative stress and enhanced peer support but also the potential to worsen burnout by adding to chronic work overload. CONCLUSIONS Surgeons reported high perceived impact of peer coaching on patient care and surgeon well-being, although changes in coachees' technical and non-technical skills were not detected over three coaching sessions. While quantitative skill measurement warrants further study, longitudinal peer surgical coaching should be considered a meaningful strategy for surgeons' professional development.","Pradarelli, Jason C; Yule, Steven; Lipsitz, Stuart R; Panda, Nikhil; Craig, Molly; Lowery, Kurt W; Ashley, Stanley W; Gee, Denise W; Waters, Peter M; Knight, Jim; Smink, Douglas S",Surgical endoscopy,318,16

The addition of MWI fly ash to transformer oil-contained PCBs was found to increase the destruction efficiency of PCBs, at the same time, it facilitated reducing the leaching concentration of toxic metals from residues (obtained after reaction) for harmless disposal. In this study, we elucidated primarily the catalysis possibility of heavy metals in raw MWI fly ash for PCBs degradation by adopting the sequential extraction procedure. For both MWI fly ashes, more than 90% destruction efficiency of PCBs was achieved at ≥375 °C for 30 min, and trichlorobenzene (TCB) existing in the transformer oil was also completely decomposed. The correlation of catalytic performance to PCBs degradation was discussed based on structural characteristics and dechlorinated products.

Limited data exist to guide the intensity of antithrombotic prophylaxis. Objective To evaluate the effects of intermediate-dose vs standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation among patients with COVID-19 admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Design, Setting, and Participants Multicenter randomized trial with a 2 × 2 factorial design performed in 10 academic centers in Iran comparing intermediate-dose vs standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation (first hypothesis) and statin therapy vs matching placebo (second hypothesis; not reported in this article) among adult patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19. Patients were recruited between July 29, 2020, and November 19, 2020. The final follow-up date for the 30-day primary outcome was December 19, 2020. Interventions Intermediate-dose (enoxaparin, 1 mg/kg daily) (n = 276) vs standard prophylactic anticoagulation (enoxaparin, 40 mg daily) (n = 286), with modification according to body weight and creatinine clearance. The assigned treatments were planned to be continued until completion of 30-day follow-up. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary efficacy outcome was a composite of venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or mortality within 30 days, assessed in randomized patients who met the eligibility criteria and received at least 1 dose of the assigned treatment. Prespecified safety outcomes included major bleeding according to the Bleeding Academic Research Consortium (type 3 or 5 definition), powered for noninferiority (a noninferiority margin of 1.8 based on odds ratio), and severe thrombocytopenia (platelet count <20 ×103/µL). All outcomes were blindly adjudicated. Results Among 600 randomized patients, 562 (93.7%) were included in the primary analysis (median [interquartile range] age, 62 [50-71] years; 237 [42.2%] women). The primary efficacy outcome occurred in 126 patients (45.7%) in the intermediate-dose group and 126 patients (44.1%) in the standard-dose prophylaxis group (absolute risk difference, 1.5% [95% CI, -6.6% to 9.8%]; odds ratio, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.76-1.48]; P = .70). Major bleeding occurred in 7 patients (2.5%) in the intermediate-dose group and 4 patients (1.4%) in the standard-dose prophylaxis group (risk difference, 1.1% [1-sided 97.5% CI, -∞ to 3.4%]; odds ratio, 1.83 [1-sided 97.5% CI, 0.00-5.93]), not meeting the noninferiority criteria (P for noninferiority >.99). Severe thrombocytopenia occurred only in patients assigned to the intermediate-dose group (6 vs 0 patients; risk difference, 2.2% [95% CI, 0.4%-3.8%]; P = .01). Conclusions and Relevance Among patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19, intermediate-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, compared with standard-dose prophylactic anticoagulation, did not result in a significant difference in the primary outcome of a composite of adjudicated venous or arterial thrombosis, treatment with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, or mortality within 30 days. These results do not support the routine empirical use of intermediate-dose prophylactic anticoagulation in unselected patients admitted to the ICU with COVID-19.

Cell-matrix adhesions are important molecular mechanosensors that their formation and maturation are force-dependent processes. However, most studies focused on the role of cell contractility or substrate stiffness in these processes. How external mechanical force stimulates the formation and maturation of cell-matrix adhesions is largely unknown. Here, by using human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs)-collagen microtissues as a 3D model, we found that upon short-term dynamic compression, integrin αV binding, focal adhesion formation, and subsequent FAK activation, are stimulated. This compression-stimulated FAK signaling also leads to YAP activation, suggesting crosstalk between integrin-based signaling and mechanosensing. More importantly, long-term compression induces maturation of α5-integrin based adhesions to form long, slender 3D-matrix adhesions (3DMAs), which are distinct from 2D focal adhesions in composition and morphology and previously found only in cell-derived matrices and native tissues. Mechanical preconditioning hMSCs with long-term compression loading induces the formation of mature integrin α5-dependent 3DMAs and potentiates their osteogenesis. Collectively, this work shows that active mechanical stimulation can modulate cell-matrix interactions significantly at the cell-material interfaces in a dynamic manner, and affects cell fate decisions, demonstrating the significance of loading-based functional tissue engineering.","Li, Chuen Wai; Lau, Yu Ting; Lam, Kwok Lim; Chan, Barbara Pui",Biomaterials,318,12

OBJECTIVES To compare the Spritztube tracheal cannula with the Laryngeal Mask Airway Supreme (LMA-S) in anaesthetised adult patients. DESIGN A single-centre, randomised controlled study. SETTING Tertiary hospital. PATIENTS Mechanically ventilated patients undergoing elective surgery in the supine position under general anaesthesia were included. Main exclusion criteria were a history of, or predicted, difficult airway management according to SIAARTI guidelines and absence of written informed consent. INTERVENTIONS Patients received the LMA-S or Spritztube tracheal cannula to facilitate ventilation of the lungs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Successful placement (primary outcome), time required for insertion, number of attempts, subjective assessment of ease of insertion, safety and incidence of complications were recorded. RESULTS One hundred and sixty seven patients were allocated to the LMA-S or Spritztube group, respectively, a total of 334 patients. In the LMA-S group, the device insertion failed in nine patients, compared with none in the Spritztube group (P = 0.002). Spritztube insertion was easy in 100% of cases compared with 94.6% of the cases in the LMA-S group (P = 0.03). The number of attempts was significantly higher with the LMA-S compared with the Spritztube (P = 0.0007), whereas the insertion times were comparable (P = 0.06). Except for the incidence of blood-staining, which was higher in the LMA-S group (P = 0.01), the number of complications was comparable in the two groups. CONCLUSION The Spritztube was as effective as the LMA-S in maintaining the airway with all patients being successfully ventilated without difficulty. The success rate of achieving a patent airway was comparable between the groups, with a similar occurrence of complications.

As a result, these elements generate new fuzzy subsets from the fuzzy elements that were previously used. The purpose of this article is to define the elements of an interoperable technology Fuzzy Applied Cell Control-soft computing language for the development of fuzzy components with distributed intelligence implemented on the DSP target. The cells in the network are configured using the operations of symbolic fusion, symbolic inference and fuzzy-real symbolic transformation, which are based on the concepts of fuzzy meaning and fuzzy description. The two applications presented in the article, Agent-based modeling and fuzzy logic for simulating pedestrian crowds in panic decision-making situations and Fuzzy controller for mobile robot, are both timely. The increasing occurrence of panic moments during mass events prompted the investigation of the impact of panic on crowd dynamics and the simulation of pedestrian flows in panic situations. Based on the research presented in the article, we propose a Fuzzy controller-based system for determining pedestrian flows and calculating the shortest evacuation distance in panic situations. Fuzzy logic, one of the representation techniques in artificial intelligence, is a well-known method in soft computing that allows the treatment of strong constraints caused by the inaccuracy of the data obtained from the robot's sensors. Based on this motivation, the second application proposed in the article creates an intelligent control technique based on Fuzzy Logic Control (FLC), a feature of intelligent control systems that can be used as an alternative to traditional control techniques for mobile robots. This method allows you to simulate the experience of a human expert. The benefits of using a network of fuzzy components are not limited to those provided distributed systems.

All medical specialties have been called to confront this unexpected event, even pediatric surgery. The objective of this study is to highlight the effect of pandemic on daily work of young pediatric surgeons during the Covid-19 first wave. METHODS An online survey was sent via email by the Scientific Committee of YPUC in April 2020. The impact of Covid-19 was invested, by analyzing the results of answers received. The difference between young consultants and trainees (C and T) were examined to assess the effect of pandemic in 2 different categories. RESULTS A total of 88 participants filled out the questionnaire. Guidelines around surgeries were well arranged: clear for 98% concerning triage with no difference between T and C; clear for 84% concerning pre-operative screening and for 81% concerning surgical dressing with a significance difference between T and C in understanding (p=0.07 and p=0.06).

Local anesthesia and conscious sedation may be useful in select short procedures. In the present study, we evaluated safety and efficacy of operative laparoscopy under conscious sedation. Methods Retrospective observational study evaluating patients undergoing gynecologic laparoscopy. Laparoscopy under conscious sedation was performed for each patient with umbilical direct insertion of a 12-mm port, followed by 2 ancillary ports at 1 cm medially to the anterior superior iliac spine. Conversion to conventional laparoscopy or laparotomy was recorded. Conscious sedation was obtained using Remifentanil and Propofol, administered by an infusion system based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models. Local anesthesia was administered at port insertion sites and for paracervical block. Pain intensity was evaluated with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Adverse events and drug concentrations throughout the procedure were retrieved. Results Our study population included 166 patients. They underwent laparoscopic unilateral versus bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, ovarian cystectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and omentectomy for a borderline ovarian tumor, myomectomy; or underwent surgery for unexplained infertility evaluation, pelvic pain, staging of ovarian cancer. Mean duration of pneumoperitoneum was 22.3 ± 7.2 min. Rate of conversion to laparoscopy under general anesthesia was 17/166 (10.2%) and there were only 3 cases of patients with low tolerability to the procedure. No severe adverse events occurred.

A multi-omics approach to cancer prevention by spinach (SPI) was pursued for the first time in the polyposis in rat colon (Pirc) model. SPI fed for 26 weeks (10% w/w, freeze-dried in the diet) exhibited significant antitumor efficacy and, in the Apc-mutant genetic background, β-catenin remained highly overexpressed in adenomatous polyps. However, in both wild type and Apc-mutant rats, increased gut microbiome diversity after SPI consumption coincided with reversal of taxonomic composition. Metagenomic prediction implicated linoleate and butanoate metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle, and pathways in cancer, which was supported by transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. Thus, tumor suppression by SPI involved marked reshaping of the gut microbiome along with changes in host RNA-miRNA networks. When colon polyps were compared with matched normal-looking tissues via metabolomics, anticancer outcomes were linked to SPI-derived linoleate bioactives with known anti-inflammatory/ proapoptotic mechanisms, as well as N-aceto-2-hydroxybutanoate, consistent with altered butanoate metabolism stemming from increased α-diversity of the gut microbiome. In colon tumors from SPI-fed rats, L-glutamate and N-acetylneuraminate also were reduced, implicating altered mitochondrial energetics and cell surface glycans involved in oncogenic signaling networks and immune evasion. In conclusion, a multi-omics approach to cancer prevention by SPI provided mechanistic support for linoleate and butanoate metabolism, as well as tumor-associated changes in L-glutamate and N-acetylneuraminate. Additional factors, such as the fiber content, also warrant further investigation with a view to delaying colectomy and drug intervention in at-risk patients.","Chen, Ying-Shiuan; Li, Jia; Menon, Rani; Jayaraman, Arul; Lee, Kyongbum; Huang, Yun; Dashwood, Wan Mohaiza; Zhang, Ke; Sun, Deqiang; Dashwood, Roderick H",Gut microbes,318,1

To assess and critically evaluate how EMA methods are currently being used in HIV research, we systematically reviewed recent published literature (October 2017-October 2019) and searched select conference databases for 2018 and 2019. RECENT FINDINGS Our searches identified 8 published articles that used EMA via smartphone app, a handheld Personal Digital Assistant, and web-based survey programs for real-time measurement of HIV-related exposures and outcomes in behavioral research. Overall trends include use of EMA and technology devices to address substance use, HIV primary prevention (e.g., condom use and preexposure prophylaxis), and HIV treatment (medication adherence). This review supports the use of EMA methods in HIV research and recommends that researchers use EMA methods to measure psychosocial factors and social contexts and with Black and Latinx samples of gay and bisexual men, transgender women, and cisgendered women to reflect current HIV disparities in the U.S.A.","Smiley, Sabrina L; Milburn, Norweeta G; Nyhan, Kate; Taggart, Tamara",Current HIV/AIDS reports,318,1

Twenty-nine of 270 patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and 23 of 218 patients who underwent laparoscopic colorectal cancer resection, respectively, were on aspirin therapy. We found no significant difference in the investigated outcome between groups with the exception of longer surgical duration of laparoscopic cholecystectomy in aspirin-treated patients.

Among asymptomatic persons, the percent positive rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) tests in the region did not appear to justify this practice. Instead of universal preoperative COVID-19 testing, the authors elected to mitigate risk by implementing a preoperative program including 14 days of recommended patient self-quarantine and social distancing. For those unable to complete this program and for those undergoing high-risk, aerosol-generating procedures, targeted rapid polymerase chain reaction testing within 2 days of surgery was performed.

METHODS This review synthesized the literature on the mental health sequelae for health workers during major pandemics and epidemics that occurred in the 21st century (severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome, Ebola virus disease, and swine flu) and interventions used to address related mental health sequelae. PubMed, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO were searched with terms related to these epidemics/pandemics. RESULTS Of 3,876 articles retrieved, 94 were included in this review. Across these studies, most health workers exhibited some adverse psychological experiences during outbreaks, with stress and anxiety being most common. Psychological distress decreased over time. Some studies reported insomnia, burnout, and posttraumatic stress for a subset of individuals up to 3 years after the disease outbreak. Few interventions have been implemented to address providers' mental health needs, and these strategies have not been evaluated systematically. CONCLUSIONS Systems-level interventions may alleviate distress for most providers without the need for specialized mental health intervention. Psychotherapeutic support and referral to specialty care should be available to health workers with severe and intense adverse psychological outcomes during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.

Unfortunately, there is currently no specific drug or treatment for COVID-19. Among all structural proteins in SARS-CoV, the spike protein is the main antigenic component responsible for inducing host immune responses, neutralizing antibodies, and/or protecting immunity against virus infection. Molecular docking is a technique used to predict whether a molecule will bind to another. It is usually a protein to another or a protein to a binding compound. Natural products are potential binders in several studies involving coronavirus. The structure of the ligand plays a fundamental role in its biological properties. The nuclear magnetic resonance technique is one of the most powerful tools for the structural determination of ligands from the origin of natural products. Nowadays, molecular modeling is an important accessory tool to experimentally got nuclear magnetic resonance data. In the present work, molecular docking studies aimed is to investigate the limiting affinities of trans-dehydrocrotonin molecule and to identify the main amino acid residues that could play a fundamental role in their mechanism of action of the SARS-CoV spike protein. Another aim of this work is all about to evaluate 10 hybrid functionalities, along with three base pairs using computational programs to discover which ones are more reliable with the experimental result the best computational method to study organic compounds. We compared the results between the mean absolute deviation (MAD) and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of the molecules, and the smallest number between them was the best result. The positions assumed by the ligands in the active site of the spike glycoprotein allow assuming associations with different local amino acids.","Cardoso, Evani Ferreira; Giacomello, Thaís Forest; Rocha de Oliveira, Leandro Leal; da Silva, Tiago Arouche; de Jesus Chaves Neto, Antonio Maia; Da Silva Mota, Gunar Vingre; Souza Siqueira, Marcelo Ricardo; Paranhos Costa, Fabio Luiz",Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology,318,1

METHODS Four patients from two different high volume neurointerventional centers developed cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage. In addition to standard techniques for the treatment of cerebral vasospasm, we used commercially available stent retrievers (Solitaire and Capture stent retrievers) to treat the vasospastic segment including M2, M1, A2, and A1. We evaluated the safety of this technique, degree of vasodilation, and longevity of the effect. RESULTS Stent retrievers can be used to safely achieve cerebral vasodilation in the setting of delayed cerebral vasospasm. The effect is long-lasting (>24 hours) and, in our initial experience, carries a low morbidity. We have not experienced any complications using this technique although we have noted that the radial force was not sufficient to cause vasodilation in some instances. The vasospasm did not return in the vessel segments treated with stent angioplasty in any of these cases. In two of our cases stent angioplasty resulted in the reversal of focal neurological symptoms.

SUMMARY BACKGROUND Interest in placebo surgery controlled trials is growing in response to concerns regarding unnecessary surgery and the societal cost of low-value healthcare. As questions about the justifiability of using placebo controls in surgery have been addressed, attention is now being paid to more practical concerns. METHODS Six databases were searched from inception - May 2020 (MEDLINE, Embase, Emcare, APA PsycInfo, CINAHL, Cochrane Library). Placebo surgery controlled trials with a published protocol were included. Three authors extracted 'projected' design aspects from protocols and 'actual' design aspects from main findings papers. Absolute and relative difference between projected and actual design aspects were presented for each trial. Trials were grouped according to whether they met their target sample size ('completed') and were concluded in a timely fashion. Pairs of authors assessed risk of bias. RESULTS Of 24 trials with data available to analyse; three were completed and concluded within target timeframe; ten were completed and concluded outside the target timeline; four were completed without clear target timeframes; two were incomplete and concluded within the target framework; five were incomplete and concluded outside the target timeline. Trials which reached the recruitment target underestimated trial duration by 88% and number of recruitment sites by 87%. CONCLUSIONS Trialists need to factor additional time and sites into future placebo surgery controlled trials.

These participants completed an initial screening for cognitive status, performance status, physical distress, and spiritual distress. There were 76 eligible participants who did not complete the study (58% female, mean age 67.9 ± 7.3 years, 76% White, 17% Black, and 7% other race).

The overall attrition rate was 24% and within the a priori projected attrition rate of 20%-30%. Considering the current historical context, this interim analysis is important because it will serve as baseline data on attrition prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.

To investigate E protein function, we previously generated E gene point mutants of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) that were defective in growth and assembled virions with anomalous morphologies. We subsequently constructed an E gene deletion (ΔE) mutant that was only minimally viable. The ΔE virus formed tiny plaques and reached optimal infectious titers many orders of magnitude below those of wild-type virus. We have now characterized highly aberrant viral transcription patterns that developed in some stocks of the ΔE mutant. Extensive analysis of three independent stocks revealed that, in each, a faster-growing virus harboring a genomic duplication had been selected. Remarkably, the net result of each duplication was the creation of a variant version of the membrane protein (M) gene that was situated upstream of the native copy of the M gene. Each different variant M gene encoded an expressed protein (M*) containing a truncated endodomain. Reconstruction of one variant M gene in a ΔE background showed that expression of the M* protein markedly enhanced the growth of the ΔE mutant and that the M* protein was incorporated into assembled virions. These findings suggest that M* proteins were repeatedly selected as surrogates for the E protein and that one role of E is to mediate interactions between transmembrane domains of M protein monomers.

METHODS Using a 23 factorial design, we randomly assigned 123 patients resuscitated from OHCA to low-normal (4.5-4.7 kPa) or high-normal (5.8-6.0 kPa) PaCO2 and to normoxia (arterial oxygen tension [PaO2] 10-15 kPa) or moderate hyperoxia (PaO2 20-25 kPa) and to low-normal or high-normal mean arterial pressure during the first 36 h in the intensive care unit. Here we report the results of the low-normal vs. high-normal PaCO2 and normoxia vs. moderate hyperoxia comparisons. The primary endpoint was the serum concentration of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) 48 h after cardiac arrest. Secondary endpoints included S100B protein and cardiac troponin concentrations, continuous electroencephalography (EEG) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) results and neurologic outcome at 6 months. RESULTS In total 120 patients were included in the analyses. There was a clear separation in PaCO2 (p < 0.001) and PaO2 (p < 0.001) between the groups. The median (interquartile range) NSE concentration at 48 h was 18.8 µg/l (13.9-28.3 µg/l) in the low-normal PaCO2 group and 22.5 µg/l (14.2-34.9 µg/l) in the high-normal PaCO2 group, p = 0.400; and 22.3 µg/l (14.8-27.8 µg/l) in the normoxia group and 20.6 µg/l (14.2-34.9 µg/l) in the moderate hyperoxia group, p = 0.594). High-normal PaCO2 and moderate hyperoxia increased NIRS values. There were no differences in other secondary outcomes.

During DISE the patients are sedated to obtain a muscular relaxation of the upper airway which mimics the relaxation during natural sleep. Different sleep stages are intended to be simulated by drug induced sedation, and it is helpful to measure the depth of sedation. The BiSpectral Index® (BIS) is often used for this procedure. Besides the BIS, other means of sedation depth monitoring exist in anaesthesiology but have not yet been investigated with respect to DISE. Monitoring of the Cerebral State Index® (CSI) is one of these methods. The aim of the study was to compare the BIS and CSI for sedation depth monitoring during DISE. METHODS Sixty patients underwent DISE monitored by the BIS and CSI in parallel. The BIS and CSI values were compared using the Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS The BIS and CSI values differed during the course of sedation during DISE by a mean of - 6.07. At light sedation (BIS 60-80), lower values by 10 scale points of CSI compared with BIS were detectable. At deeper sedation levels (BIS 40-50), the CSI turned to present equal and even higher values compared with the BIS. CONCLUSION Sedation depth measurement during DISE can be performed by the BIS or CSI, but the differences should be interpreted carefully as comparable data for sleep stages in natural sleep are available only for BIS.","Herzog, Michael; Rudzki, Mathias; Plößl, Sebastian; Plontke, Stefan; Kellner, Patrick",Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung,318,1

In physical and fluid dynamics simulations, pressure losses through the tubular parts, compressed parts, and slip joints of NTTs with internal diameters (IDs) of 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0 mm were estimated under partial compression. RESULTS The median internal minor axes of the 7.0- and 7.5-mm ID NTTs in the nasal cavity were 5.2 (4.3-5.6) mm and 6.0 (4.2-7.0) mm, respectively. With a volumetric air flow rate of 30 L/min, pressure losses through uncompressed NTTs with IDs of 6.0-, 6.5-, 7.0-, 7.5- and 8.0-mm were 651.6 ± 5.7 (6.64 ± 0.06), 453.4 ± 3.9 (4.62 ± 0.04), 336.5 ± 2.2 (3.43 ± 0.02), 225.2 ± 0.2 (2.30 ± 0.00), and 179.0 ± 1.1 Pa (1.82 ± 0.01 cmH2O), respectively; the pressure losses through the slip joints were 220.3 (2.25), 131.1 (1.33), 86.8 (0.88), 57.1 (0.58), and 36.1 Pa (0.37 cmH2O), respectively; and the pressure losses through the curvature of the NTT were 71.6 (0.73), 69.0 (0.70), 64.8 (0.66), 32.5 (0.33), and 41.6 Pa (0.42 cmH2O), respectively. A maximum compression force of 34.1 N increased the pressure losses by 82.0 (0.84), 38.0 (0.39), 23.5 (0.24), 16.6 (0.17), and 9.3 Pa (0.09 cmH2O), respectively. CONCLUSION Pressure losses through NTTs are in inverse proportion to the tubes' IDs; greater pressure losses due to slip joints, acute bending, and partial compression of the NTT were obvious in small NTTs. Pressure losses through NTTs, especially in small NTTs, could increase the work of breathing to a greater extent than that through standard tubes; intranasal compression further increases the pressure loss.","Futagawa, Koichi; Takasugi, Yoshihiro; Kobayashi, Takeharu; Morishita, Satoshi; Okuda, Takahiko",BMC anesthesiology,318,28

PATIENTS AND METHODS Ten patients with clinical stage T1-T2 bladder cancer underwent a LESS radical cystectomy. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 64.8 (8.6) years and their mean body mass index was 25.9 (2.7) kg/m(2). The procedure was done via a single-incision laparoscopic surgery port using a rigid 5-mm 30° long-shaft laparoscope in addition to the two working instruments. A 7-cm Pfannenstiel incision was made to remove the specimens and to allow the creation of an ileal neobladder with hand assistance. RESULTS In eight patients the LESS radical cystectomy was completed as scheduled, with the other two requiring a conversion, one to an open procedure due to locally advanced disease, and the other to conventional laparoscopy due to gas leakage. The mean (SD) operative duration was 236 (49) min, with a mean estimated blood loss of 575 (113) mL, and a mean hospital stay of 5.5 (0.7) days. No postoperative analgesic medications were prescribed and patients returned to normal activity after a mean (SD) of 17.6 (2.6) days. The pathological examination showed negative surgical margins for the bladder specimens, with a mean (SD) of 14 (1.9) lymph nodes retrieved. Seven patients were cancer-free within a mean (SD, range) follow-up of 37 (6, 29-44) months. CONCLUSIONS LESS radical cystectomy is technically feasible, with a favourable course and convalescence, and it has an acceptable oncological outcome.","Abdallah, Ahmed; Abdel-Hakiem, Mahmoud; El-Feel, Ahmed",Arab journal of urology,318,33

This study explores the impact of US sanctions in Iran's health research system. METHODS This phenomenological study interviewed 24 Iranian health science scholars through purposeful sampling to learn about their experiences and thoughts regarding the impact of US sanctions on Iran's health research system. RESULTS The impact of sanctions on Iran's health research system were classified into five categories: (a) financial issues, (b) difficulty in supplying laboratory materials and (c) equipment, (d) disruption in international research collaboration and activities, and (e) other issues (e.g., increased stress and workload). CONCLUSION This study indicated that since research centers in Iran are highly dependent on governmental budgets, sanctions have greatly affected the health research system in Iran. Financial and economic problems, restrictions in transferring funds, and the disruption in political and international relations have created many challenges for supplying medical laboratory materials and equipment for medical and health research centers in Iran.","Dehghani, Mohammad; Mesgarpour, Bita; Akhondzadeh, Shahin; Azami-Aghdash, Saber; Ferdousi, Reza",Archives of Iranian medicine,318,16

We aimed to assess 1-month outcome in ischemic stroke patients with Covid-19 infection who received IVT alone or before thrombectomy (bridging therapy). METHODS As a collaboration initiative promoted by the Italian Stroke Organization, all Italian Stroke Units (n=190) were contacted and invited to participate in a data collection on stroke patients with Covid-19 who received IVT. RESULTS Seventy-five invited centers agreed to participate. Thirty patients received IVT alone and 17 received bridging therapy between 21 February and 30 April 2020 in 20 centers (n=18, Northern Italy; n=2, Central Italy). At 1 month, 14 (30.4%) patients died and 20 (62.5%) survivors had mRS score 3-5. At 24-36 hours, asymptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) was reported in 8 (17.4%) patients, symptomatic ICH (sICH) in 2 (4.3%) patients. Causes of death were severe ischemic stroke (n=8), a new ischemic stroke (n=2), acute respiratory failure (n=1), acute renal failure (n=1), acute myocardial infarction (n=1), and endocarditis (n=1). In survivors with 1-month mRS score 3-5, baseline glucose level was higher, while endovascular procedure time in case of bridging therapy was longer. Baseline NIHSS score baseline glucose level, and creatinine level were higher in patients who died. CONCLUSIONS IVT for patients with stroke and Covid-19 was not a rare event in the most affected areas by pandemic, and rates of 1-month unfavorable outcomes were high compared to previous data from the pre-Covid-19 literature. However, risk of sICH was not increased.","Cappellari, Manuel; Zini, Andrea; Sangalli, Davide; Cavallini, Anna; Reggiani, Monica; Nicoletta Sepe, Federica; Rifino, Nicola; Giussani, Giuditta; Guidetti, Donata; Zedde, Marialuisa; Marcheselli, Simona; Longoni, Marco; Beretta, Simone; Sidoti, Vincenzo; Papurello, Diego Maria; Giosi, Alessia; Nencini, Patrizia; Plocco, Maurizio; Balestrino, Maurizio; Rota, Eugenia; Toni, Danilo",European journal of neurology,318,25

METHODS Plasma of 200-400 mL was collected from convalescent patients 2 weeks after being discharged from the hospital. After viral nucleic acid testing and antibody testing, the plasma was infused into 16 severe or critical COVID-19 patients. Time for viral nucleic acid amplification (NAA) test turning negative, total volume of plasma transfusion, average antibody concentration, and total antibody amount were recorded. White blood cell (WBC) counts, lymphocyte (LYM) counts, neutrophil (NEU) counts, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB), hypersensitive cardiac troponin T (hs-cTnT), and lactic acid (Lac) levels were measured and the rate of change was calculated at the baseline (d0) before plasma transfusion, and day 1 (d1), day 3 (d3) after transfusion. RESULTS (1) Patient characteristics: among the 16 patients, 5 cases (31.25%) were severe COVID-19, and 11 cases (68.75%) were critical COVID-19; 62.50% (10/16) of the patients had primary disease; the percentage of invasive ventilation and use of extracorporeal membrane pulmonary oxygenation (ECMO) in critical patients were 90.91% (10/11) and 45.46% (5/11) respectively. (2) Antibody concentration of convalescent plasma and time for NAA test turning negative: the convalescent plasma antibody concentration in this study was ranged from 10.93 kAU/L to 114.7 kAU/L, with an average value of (56.44±39.40) kAU/L. NAA test was continuously positive before plasma transfusion in 10 patients, and the time for NAA test turning negative could be counted. Eight patients turned negative from day 2 to day 8 after transfusion. Severe patients showed a shorter time for NAA test turning negative than critical patients after transfusion [2 (2-3) vs. 5 (3-8), P = 0.036]. Two critical patients transfused plasma with lower antibody concentration remained a positive result of NAA test, and died on the 3rd and 6th day respectively. (3) Laboratory results: the change rates of WBC (0.81±0.28 vs. 1.00) and NEU (0.75±0.33 vs. 1.00) were significantly decreased at d1 after convalescent plasma treatment (both P < 0.05), and the CRP level decreased to about 63% of that before transfusion (P = 0.017). No adverse events were observed during convalescent plasma transfusion. CONCLUSIONS Viral NAA test of most patients with COVID-19 who received convalescent plasma transfusion turned negative from day 2 to day 8 after transfusion, and the turning time of severe patients was shorter than that of critical patients. Convalescent plasma therapy can reduce the patients' CRP level, and no adverse events were found during the treatment. The antibody concentration in the convalescent plasma may be one of the factors that affect the time for the nucleic acid turning negative after transfusion. Detection and screening convalescent plasma of high-titer antibody and early application to severe and critical patients are expected to improve the efficacy of convalescent plasma.","Chen, Shanshan; Lu, Chunya; Li, Ping; Wang, Lei; Wang, Huaqi; Yang, Qiankun; Chen-Li, Yinghui; Li, Jianbin; Ma, Hongwei; Sang, Qian; Xu, Luyang; Li, Jing; Zhang, Yi; Kang, Yi; Xing, Lihua; Zhang, Guojun",Zhonghua wei zhong bing ji jiu yi xue,318,31

A model was developed for the controlled delivery of a defined dose of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis to surgically isolated ileal segments in newborn calves. The stable intestinal segments enabled the characterization of host responses to persistent M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infections after a 9-month period, including an analysis of local mucosal immune responses relative to an adjacent uninfected intestinal compartment. M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis remained localized at the initial site of intestinal infection and was not detected by PCR in the mesenteric lymph node. M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-specific T cell proliferative responses included both CD4 and γδ T cell receptor (γδTcR) T cell responses in the draining mesenteric lymph node. The levels of CD8(+) and γδTcR(+) T cells increased significantly (P < 0.05) in the lamina propria, and M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-specific tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) and gamma interferon secretion by lamina propria leukocytes was also significantly (P < 0.05) increased. There was a significant (P < 0.05) accumulation of macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs) in the lamina propria, but the expression of mucosal toll-like receptors 1 through 10 was not significantly changed by M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection. In conclusion, surgically isolated ileal segments provided a model system for the establishment of a persistent and localized enteric M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection in cattle and facilitated the analysis of M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-specific changes in mucosal leukocyte phenotype and function. The accumulation of DC subpopulations in the lamina propria suggests that further investigation of mucosal DCs may provide insight into host responses to M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection and improve vaccine strategies to prevent M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis infection.","Charavaryamath, Chandrashekhar; Gonzalez-Cano, Patricia; Fries, Patrick; Gomis, Susantha; Doig, Kimberley; Scruten, Erin; Potter, Andrew; Napper, Scott; Griebel, Philip J",Clinical and vaccine immunology : CVI,318,12

One way to assess the relationship between signals from different brain regions is to measure their phase synchronization (PS) across time. There are several ways to perform such analyses, and we compare methods that utilize a PS metric together with a sliding window, referred to here as windowed phase synchronization (WPS), with those that directly measure the instantaneous phase synchronization (IPS). In particular, IPS has recently gained popularity as it offers single time-point resolution of time-resolved fMRI connectivity. In this paper, we discuss the underlying assumptions required for performing PS analyses and emphasize the importance of band-pass filtering the data to obtain valid results. Further, we contrast this approach with the use of Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) to achieve similar goals. We review various methods for evaluating PS and introduce a new approach within the IPS framework denoted the cosine of the relative phase (CRP). We contrast methods through a series of simulations and application to rs-fMRI data. Our results indicate that CRP outperforms other tested methods and overcomes issues related to undetected temporal transitions from positive to negative associations common in IPS analysis. Further, in contrast to phase coherence, CRP unfolds the distribution of PS measures, which benefits subsequent clustering of PS matrices into recurring brain states.","Honari, Hamed; Choe, Ann S; Lindquist, Martin A",NeuroImage,318,1

Gender differences were assessed using a multivariable adjusted logistic regression model using gender as independent and exposures as dependent variables. Metabolic equivalents-hour/week was used to evaluate physical activity. A total of 2218 participants (761 men and 1457 women) agreed to participate in the study and completed the questionnaire. The survey found that women compared to men showed 1) a lower level of physical activity before the institution of lockdown, 2) a lower tendency to reduce physical activity levels during the lockdown, when gender differences in compliance with guideline recommendations for physical activity disappeared, 3) and a worsening of sleep and stool passage; men experienced an increase in alcohol consumption. CONCLUSIONS Women, who previously had a lower level of physical activity than men, showed a lower tendency to reduce it during lockdown, revealing greater resilience than men. However, the worsening in sleep, in stool passage, and a trend to weight increase revealed signs of psychological suffering after a protracted lockdown period.","Orlandi, Melissa; Rosselli, Martina; Pellegrino, Alessio; Boddi, Maria; Stefani, Laura; Toncelli, Loira; Modesti, Pietro Amedeo","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",318,0

To be prepared for any possibility, we consider it important to summarize the current knowledge regarding COVID-19 of liver and kidney transplant patients. Very early reports from Spanish and French registry recorded fatality rates of 18.6% and 13%, respectively, in renal patients which suggests a moderately worse outcome compared to the general population. In patients with positive PCR test but not showing clinical signs, the reduction of immunosuppression is not advised. In the case of gastrointestinal or respiratory signs with fever, the discontinuation of mycophenolate or mTOR inhibitors is recommended with decrease of the trough levels of calcineurin inhibitors to the lowest effective limit. Stop (kidney transplanted patients) or decrease (liver transplanted patients) immunosuppression and maintain corticosteroids when pulmonal injury develops and consider anti-IL1 and anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody use when hyperinflammatory syndrome is evolving. No proven effective treatment for SARS-CoV-2 exists currently. The use of lopinavir/ritonavir should be avoided because of the severe drug interaction with calcineurin inhibitors.

PURPOSE To investigate the difference between the patient background of both CAFL and AF in the non-elderly. METHODS In 526 consecutive patients who underwent catheter ablation of clinical paroxysmal/persistent CAFL or AF in our hospital, we enrolled only patients under 60 years old. Cases harboring both AFL and AF were excluded. We analyzed the patient characteristics, echocardiographic findings, electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities during sinus rhythm, and clinical course after ablation. RESULTS In total, 196 patients (Cohort 1: 142 males, 156 AF cases) were analyzed. AFL patients were younger than AF patients (47.4 ± 10.6 vs. 50.2 ± 6.4years, p = 0.031) and organic heart disease (OHD) was significantly more common in AFL patients than AF patients (42.5% vs. 11.5%, p<0.001). In 161 patients excluding OHD (Cohort 2), ECG abnormalities were more frequent in AFL than in AF patients (78.3% vs. 39.1%, p = 0.001). There were no significant differences in all-cause death, onset of heart failure, and cerebral strokes. On the other hand, the number of cases that required a pacemaker was significantly higher in the CAFL group than AF group (0.0% vs. 26.1%, p-value <0.001). These results suggested that CAFL may reflect occurrence of any atrial myocardial damage, even if it does not lead to heart failure. CONCLUSIONS Our present study suggested that CAFL may be associated with a broader atrial myocardial disorder in non-elderly patients.","Takahira, Haruhiro; Kajiyama, Takatsugu; Kondo, Yusuke; Nakano, Masahiro; Nakano, Miyo; Ito, Ryo; Kitagawa, Mari; Sugawara, Masafumi; Chiba, Toshinori; Kobayashi, Yoshio",Journal of cardiology,318,1

MATERIAL AND METHODS Twenty-one patients requiring tooth extraction and implant placement were randomly allocated to two different alveolar ridge preservation techniques. In the control group, demineralized bovine bone mineral (DBBM) and a gingival soft tissue punch were used to fill and seal the socket, whereas in the test group, the extraction socket was filled with DBBM and sealed with a hemostatic gelatin sponge. Digitalized impressions were taken before and 6 months after tooth extraction. The comparison was made on horizontal and vertical dimensional changes. RESULTS The mean vertical loss was 0.8 ± 0.6 mm for the control group and 0.7 ± 0.5 mm for the test one. No statistical difference was found between groups for the vertical shrinkage. The horizontal dimensional narrowing of the alveolar socket was respectively 7.1/4.0/2.5 mm at levels 1, 3, and 5 mm from a coronal reference level for the control group. The test group showed dimensional changes of 4.8/2.3/1.3 mm at the three different levels, respectively. A significant difference was found at levels 3 and 5 mm. Referring to a visual analog pain scale, patients reported more severe pain in the control group (5.7/10) when compared with the test group (2.8/10).

Improved right ventricular (RV) function, thereby reducing venous congestion, may play a role. We assessed the effect of HR control with esmolol during sepsis on RV function, macrocirculation, microcirculation, end-organ-perfusion, and ventricular-arterial coupling. Sepsis was induced in 10 healthy anesthetized and mechanically ventilated sheep by continuous IV administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Esmolol was infused after successful resuscitation of the septic shock, to reduce HR and stopped 30-min after reaching targeted HR reduction of 30%. Venous and arterial blood gases were sampled and the small intestines' microcirculation was assessed by using a hand-held video microscope (CytoCam-IDF). Arterial and venous pressures, and cardiac output (CO) were recorded continuously. An intraventricular micromanometer was used to assess the RV function. Ventricular-arterial coupling ratio (VACR) was estimated by catheterization-derived single beat estimation. The targeted HR reduction of >30% by esmolol infusion, after controlled resuscitation of the LPS induced septic shock, led to a deteriorated RV-function and macrocirculation, while the microcirculation remained depressed. Esmolol improved VACR by decreasing the RV end-systolic pressure. Stopping esmolol showed the reversibility of these effects on the RV and the macrocirculation. In this animal model of acute severe endotoxic septic shock, early administration of esmolol decreased RV-function resulting in venous congestion and an unimproved poor microcirculation despite improved cardiac mechanical efficiency.","van Loon, Lex M; van der Hoeven, Johannes G; Veltink, Peter H; Lemson, Joris",Physiological reports,318,1

The Bulianta coal was the typical sub-bituminous coal in China, and the coal molecular model of which was constructed based on proximate analysis, ultimate analysis, 13C-NMR, and XPS. The chemical structure model of the coal molecule was optimized, and the periodic boundary condition was added via the method of molecular dynamics methods. The different combined systems formed by collectors, water, and a model surface of Bulianta coal have been studied using molecular dynamics simulation. The simulation results of dodecanol and methyl laurate on the surface of Bulianta coal show that dodecanol molecules are not evenly adsorbed on the surface of coal, and have higher adsorption capacity near carboxyl and hydroxyl groups, but less adsorption capacity near carbonyl and ether bonds. Methyl laurate can completely cover the oxygen-containing functional groups on the coal surface. Compared with dodecanol, methyl laurate can effectively improve the hydrophobicity of the Bulianta coal surface, which is consistent with the results of the XPS test and the flotation test.","Zhang, He; Xi, Peng; Zhuo, Qiming; Liu, Wenli",Molecules,318,7

Initial research has examined the validity and acceptability of teleneuropsychology (teleNP) in research settings, but there is less information about teleNP implementation in clinical practice. Here we describe the development of a teleNP clinic and compare patient satisfaction to those completing in-person neuropsychological evaluations. Method: A teleNP clinic was developed at the VA Bedford Healthcare System to serve older Veterans with referral questions focused on cognitive aging concerns. Patients presented to affiliated VA satellite clinics and were connected to neuropsychology clinicians at the main hospital campus through synchronous video. An evaluation battery was compiled to closely approximate in-person evaluations. Trained staff members at the satellite clinic assisted with administration of select tasks. Patient satisfaction was evaluated using a self-report questionnaire and responses were compared to a group undergoing in-person neuropsychological evaluations. Results: Self-reported satisfaction was high for all aspects of the patient experience, with no significant difference found between teleNP (n = 67) and in-person (n = 64) groups. In particular, 90% of patients in the teleNP group and 98% of patients in the in-person group agreed or strongly agreed with the statement, ""I was overall satisfied with this visit."". Conclusions: TeleNP is a feasible and acceptable alternative to traditional in-person neuropsychological evaluations in clinical practice focused on older adults. Future research should continue to validate evaluation measures used in telehealth settings, identify the populations that would benefit most from teleNP services, and explore the expansion of teleNP services.","Appleman, Erica R; O'Connor, Maureen K; Boucher, Sarah J; Rostami, Ramona; Sullivan, Sara K; Migliorini, Robyn; Kraft, Malissa",The Clinical neuropsychologist,318,16

METHODS Seventy-one adult patients were randomized into three groups. Propofol group (n = 25): propofol-remifentanil regimenand the dosage was adjusted to maintain the bispectral index (BIS) between 40 and 50. DP adjusted group (n = 23): Dexmedetomidine (0.5 μg/kg loading dose infused over 10 min followed by a constant infusion of 0.5 μg/kg/h) was added to the propofol-remifentanil regimen and propofol was adjusted to maintain BIS between 40 and 50. DP unadjusted group (n = 23): Dexmedetomidine (administer as DP adjusted group) was added to the propofol-remifentanil regimen and propofol was not adjusted. All patients received MEP, SSEP and BIS monitoring. RESULTS There were no significant changes in the amplitude and latency of MEP and SSEP among different groups (P > 0.05). The estimated propofol plasma concentration in DP adjusted group (2.7 ± 0.3 μg/ml) was significantly lower than in propofol group (3.1 ± 0.2 μg/ml) and DP unadjusted group (3.1 ± 0.2 μg/ml) (P = 0.000). BIS in DP unadjusted group (35 ± 5) was significantly lower than in propofol group (44 ± 3) (P = 0.000).

In addition, the number of E. coli biofilm infections continue to increase with time. Notably, biofilms are attractive targets for the prevention of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. Moreover, the pgaABCD-encoded Poly-β-1,6-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (PNAG) plays an important role in biofilm formation. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the specific effect of the (R)-(+)-pulegone (PU) on growth and biofilm formation in multi-drug resistant E. coli. The molecular mechanisms involved were also examined. The results showed that PU had significant antibacterial and antibiofilm formation activity against E. coli K1, with MIC and MBC values of 23.68 and 47.35 mg/mL, respectively. On the other hand, the maximum inhibition rate for biofilm formation in the bacterium was 52.36 % at 94.70 mg/mL of PU. qRT-PCR data showed that PU significantly down-regulated expression of the pgaABCD genes (P < 0.05). PU was also broadly effective against biofilm formation in MG1655 and MG1655/ΔpgaABCD, exhibiting the maximum inhibition rates were 98.23 % and 93.35 %, respectively. In addition, PU destroyed pre-formed mature biofilm in both MG1655 and MG1655/ΔpgaABCD about 95.03 % and 92.4 %, respectively. The study therefore verified that pgaA was a potential and key target for PU in E. coli although it was not the only one. Overall, the findings indicated that PU is a potential and novel inhibitor of drug resistance, This therefore gives insights on new ways of preventing and treating biofilm-associated infections in the food industry as well as in clinical practice.","Gong, Haiyan; He, Lijuan; Zhao, Zhilong; Mao, Xinmin; Zhang, Chen",Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,318,24

We analysed sex differences in a low epidemic area with low overall mortality in Covid-19 in a population based setting with patients treated in specialized healthcare. METHODS We entered all hospitalized laboratory-confirmed Covid-19 cases of all specialized healthcare hospitals of the Capital Province of Finland, into a population-based quality registry and described demographics, severity and case-fatality by sex of the first Covid-19 wave February-June 2020. RESULTS Altogether 5471 patients (49% male) were identified. Patients hospitalized in the specialist healthcare (N = 585, 54% male, OR 1.25; 95% CI 1.05-1.48) were of the same age. Men had less asthma and thyroid insufficiency and more coronary artery disease compared to women. Mean time from symptom onset to diagnosis was at least one day longer for men (p=.005). Men required intensive care unit (ICU) more often (27% vs. 17%) with longer lengths-of-stays at ICU. Male sex associated with significantly higher case-fatality at 90-days (15% vs. 8%) and all excess male deaths occurring after three weeks from onset. Men with fatal outcomes had delays in both Covid-19 testing and hospital admission after a positive test. The delays in patients with the most severe and fatal outcomes differed markedly by sex. In multivariable analysis, male sex associated independently with case-fatality (OR 2.37; 95% CI 1.22-4.59). CONCLUSIONS Male sex associated with higher disease severity and case-fatality.

Much effort has been devoted in the identification of major histocompatibility complex class II eptiopes from different tumor-associated antigens. Melan-A/MART-1 is expressed specifically in normal melanocytes and tumor cells of 75% to 100% of melanoma patients. Melan-A/MART-1 is considered as an attractive target for cancer immunotherapy. In the past, several human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II restricted epitopes have been identified and characterized, including Melan-A/MART-11-20 (HLA-DR11 restricted), Melan-A/MART-125-36 (HLA-DQ6 and HLA-DR3 restricted), Melan-A/MART-127-40 (HLA-DR1 restricted), Melan-A/MART-151-73 (HLA-DR4 restricted), Melan-A/MART-191-110 (HLA-DR52 restricted), and Melan-A/MART-1100-111 (HLA-DR1 restricted). Owing to the infrequent expression of the above HLA class II alleles in Asian populations, immunotherapy using these defined Melan-A/MART-1 peptides could potentially only benefit a very small percentage of Asian melanoma patients. In this study, we established several CD4 T-cell clones by in vitro stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a healthy donor by a peptide pool of 28 to 30 amino acid long peptides spanning the entire Melan-A/MART-1 protein. These CD4 T-cell clones recognized a peptide that is embedded within Melan-A/MART-121-50, in a HLA-DPB1*0501 restricted manner. Finally, we demonstrated that this epitope is naturally processed and presented by dendritic cells. HLA-DPB1*0501 is frequently expressed in Asian population (44.9% to 73.1%). Therefore, this epitope could provide a new tool and could significantly increase the percentage of melanoma patients that can benefit from cancer immunotherapy.","Meng, Zhaoting; Wang, Yadong; Zhang, Guanzhong; Ke, Yuehua; Yan, Yanfeng; Wu, Liangliang; Huang, Qianrong; Zeng, Gang; Wang, Yu; Ying, Han; Jiao, Shunchang",Journal of immunotherapy,318,1

New pathogens in wastewater are constantly emerging. For example, SARS-CoV-2 has been recently detected in domestic sewage and primary sludge. Knowledge about the reduction of viruses in wastewater treatment and their partitioning between the treated liquid effluent versus the sludge or biosolids is still very scarce, especially in countries with emerging economies and tropical climates. Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors are among the top three most commonly used technologies for the treatment of sewage in Latin America and the Caribbean, and their use has become increasingly common in many other low- and middle-income countries. High-rate algal ponds (HRAP) are regarded as a sustainable technology for the post-treatment of UASB effluent. This study evaluated the overall reduction and the liquid-solid partitioning of somatic coliphages, F-specific coliphages, and E. coli in a pilot-scale system comprised of a UASB reactor followed by HRAPs treating real wastewater. Average log removal for somatic and F-specific coliphages were 0.40 and 0.56 for the UASB reactor, and 1.15 and 1.70 for HRAPs, respectively. The overall removal of both phages in the system was 2.06-log. Removal of E. coli was consistently higher. The number of viruses leaving the system in the UASB solids and algal biomass was less than 10% of the number leaving in the clarified liquid effluent. The number of E. coli leaving the system in solids residuals was estimated to be approximately one order of magnitude higher than the number of E. coli leaving in the liquid effluent. Results from this study demonstrate the suitability of UASB-HRAP systems to reduce viral and bacterial indicators from domestic sewage and the importance of adequately treating sludge for pathogen reduction before they are used as biosolids.","Espinosa, Maria Fernanda; Verbyla, Matthew E; Vassalle, Lucas; Rosa-Machado, Alcino Trindade; Zhao, Fei; Gaunin, Anaïs; Mota, César Rossas",The Science of the total environment,318,1

The relevance of cell polarity in the HCV life cycle has been addressed only in distantly related models and remains poorly understood. Although polarized epithelial cells have a rather simple morphology with a basolateral and an apical domain, hepatocytes exhibit complex polarization structures. However, it has been reported that some selected polarized HepG2 cell clones can exhibit a honeycomb pattern of distribution of the tight-junction proteins typical of columnar polarized epithelia, which can be used as a simple model to study the role of cell polarization in viral infection of hepatocytes. To obtain similar clones, HepG2 cells expressing CD81 (HepG2-CD81) were used, and clones were isolated by limiting dilutions. Two clones exhibiting a simple columnar polarization capacity when grown on a semipermeable support were isolated and characterized. To test the polarity of HCV entry and release, our polarized HepG2-CD81 clones were infected with cell culture-derived HCV. Our data indicate that HCV binds equally to both sides of the cells, but productive infection occurs mainly when the virus is added at the basolateral domain. Furthermore, we also observed that HCV virions are released from the basolateral domain of the cells. Finally, when polarized cells were treated with oleic acid and U0126, a MEK inhibitor, to promote lipoprotein secretion, a higher proportion of infectious viral particles of lower density were secreted. This cell culture system provides an excellent model to investigate the influence of cell polarization on the HCV life cycle.IMPORTANCE Hepatitis C is a major health burden, with approximately 170 million persons infected worldwide. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) primarily infects hepatocytes, which are highly polarized cells with a complex organization. The relevance of cell polarity in the HCV life cycle has been addressed in distantly related models and remains unclear. Hepatocyte organization is complex, with multiple apical and basolateral surfaces. A simple culture model of HepG2 cells expressing CD81 that are able to polarize with unique apical and basolateral domains was developed to study HCV infection. With this model, we demonstrated that HCV enters and exits hepatocytes by the basolateral domain. Furthermore, lower-density viral particles were produced under conditions that promote lipoprotein secretion. This cell culture system provides a useful model to study the influence of cell polarization on HCV infection.","Belouzard, Sandrine; Danneels, Adeline; Fénéant, Lucie; Séron, Karin; Rouillé, Yves; Dubuisson, Jean",Journal of virology,318,24

SAMPLE Fifty-four parents (40 mothers, 14 fathers). MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE Categories of family involvement and support in the parents' decision making. RESULTS Most parents did not seek advice from family members for life-support decisions made prenatally. Instead, parents made the decision as a couple with their physician without seeking family input. Family members provided certain types of support: emotional support, advice and information, prayer, and instrumental help such as child care. Most parents described at least one way their family supported them. For postnatal and end-of-life decisions, parents were more likely to seek advice from extended family in addition to the other forms of support.","Kavanaugh, Karen; Nantais-Smith, Leanne M; Savage, Teresa; Schim, Stephanie Myers; Natarajan, Girija",Neonatal network : NN,318,14

Peripheral or central inflammation is characterized by an upregulation of cytokines and their receptors in the brain. Emerging evidence indicates that pro-inflammatory cytokines modulate brain excitability. Findings from both the clinical literature and from in vivo and in vitro laboratory studies suggest that cytokines can increase seizure susceptibility and may be involved in epileptogenesis. Cellular mechanisms that underlie these effects include upregulation of excitatory glutamatergic transmission and downregulation of inhibitory GABAergic transmission.","Galic, Michael A; Riazi, Kiarash; Pittman, Quentin J",Frontiers in neuroendocrinology,318,16

METHODS In the Carbon dioxide, Oxygen and Mean arterial pressure After Cardiac Arrest and REsuscitation (COMACARE) trial, we used a 23 factorial design to randomly assign patients after OHCA and resuscitation to low-normal or high-normal levels of arterial carbon dioxide tension, to normoxia or moderate hyperoxia, and to low-normal or high-normal MAP. In this paper we report the results of the low-normal (65-75 mmHg) vs. high-normal (80-100 mmHg) MAP comparison. The primary outcome was the serum concentration of neuron-specific enolase (NSE) at 48 h after cardiac arrest. The feasibility outcome was the difference in MAP between the groups. Secondary outcomes included S100B protein and cardiac troponin (TnT) concentrations, electroencephalography (EEG) findings, cerebral oxygenation and neurological outcome at 6 months after cardiac arrest. RESULTS We recruited 123 patients and included 120 in the final analysis. We found a clear separation in MAP between the groups (p < 0.001). The median (interquartile range) NSE concentration at 48 h was 20.6 µg/L (15.2-34.9 µg/L) in the low-normal MAP group and 22.0 µg/L (13.6-30.9 µg/L) in the high-normal MAP group, p = 0.522. We found no differences in the secondary outcomes. CONCLUSIONS Targeting a specific range of MAP was feasible during post-resuscitation intensive care. However, the blood pressure level did not affect the NSE concentration at 48 h after cardiac arrest, nor any secondary outcomes.","Jakkula, Pekka; Pettilä, Ville; Skrifvars, Markus B; Hästbacka, Johanna; Loisa, Pekka; Tiainen, Marjaana; Wilkman, Erika; Toppila, Jussi; Koskue, Talvikki; Bendel, Stepani; Birkelund, Thomas; Laru-Sompa, Raili; Valkonen, Miia; Reinikainen, Matti",Intensive care medicine,318,17

Though Zika virus was first isolated in 1947, till the recent large-scale outbreak which occurred in Micronesia, in 2007, the virus was placed into the innocuous pathogen category. The World Health Organization on 1 February 2016 declared it as a 'Public Health Emergency of International Concern.' Of the note, American as well as Pacific Island strains/isolates is relatively closer to Asian lineage strains. The African and American strains share more than 87.5% and 95% homologies with Asian strains/isolates, respectively. Asian strains form independent clusters, except those isolated from China, suggesting relatively more diversity than African strains. Prevention and control are mainly aimed at the vector population (mosquitoes) with Aedes aegypti being the main species. Surveys in Africa and Asia indicated seropositivity in various animal species. However, so far its natural reservoir is unknown. There is an urgent need to understand why Zika virus has shifted from being a virus that caused mild illness to unforeseen birth defects as well as autoimmune-neurological problems. Unfortunately, an effective vaccine is not available yet. Availability of cryo-electron microscopy based on 3.8 Å resolution revealing mature Zika virus structure and the probable virus attachment site to host cell would provide critical insights into the development of antiviral treatments and vaccines.","Singh, Raj Kumar; Dhama, Kuldeep; Malik, Yashpal Singh; Ramakrishnan, Muthannan Andavar; Karthik, Kumaragurubaran; Tiwari, Ruchi; Saurabh, Sharad; Sachan, Swati; Joshi, Sunil Kumar",The Veterinary quarterly,318,25

The authors elicit four lessons from the analysis. First, gender needs to be mainstreamed at all stages of a public health emergency response. Second, in addition to medical care, all formal and informal care work should be considered as an essential component of health care systems. Third, a people-centered approach in health governance should be prioritized to make women's voices heard at every level. Fourth, medical technology and resources to cope with pandemic should be produced and distributed in an equitable manner, acknowledging differential vulnerability and susceptibility.","Kim, Saerom; Kim, Jin-Hwan; Park, Yukyung; Kim, Sun; Kim, Chang-Yup",Health education & behavior : the official publication of the Society for Public Health Education,318,1

Yet, even after the ACA's implementation, millions of people were covered through noncompliant plans, primarily in the form of continued enrollment in ""grandmothered"" and ""grandfathered"" plans that predated ACA's full implementation and were allowed under federal and state regulations. Newly proposed and enacted federal legislation may grow the noncompliant segment in future years, and the employment losses of 2020 may grow reliance on individual market coverage further. These factors make it important to understand how the noncompliant segment affects the compliant segment, including the Marketplaces. We show, first, that the noncompliant segment of the individual insurance market substantially outperformed the compliant segment, charging lower premiums but with vastly lower costs, suggesting that insurers have a strong incentive to enter the noncompliant segment. We show, next, that state's decisions to allow grandmothered plans is associated with stronger financial performance of the noncompliant market, but weaker performance of the compliant segment, as noncompliant plans attract lower-cost enrollees. This finding indicates important linkages between the noncompliant and compliant segments and highlights the role state policy can play in the individual insurance market. Taken together, our results point to substantial cream-skimming, with noncompliant plans enrolling the healthiest enrollees, resulting in higher average claims cost in the compliant segment.","Sacks, Daniel W; Drake, Coleman; Abraham, Jean M; Simon, Kosali","Inquiry : a journal of medical care organization, provision and financing",318,26

Glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) is a key protein kinase implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Blockade of GSK-3β is an attractive therapeutic strategy for AD. Isoorientin, a 6-C-glycosylflavone, was previously shown to be a highly selective inhibitor of GSK-3β, while exerting neuroprotective effects in neuronal models of AD. In the present study, we evaluated the in vivo effects of isoorientin on GSK-3β, tau phosphorylation, Aβ deposition, neuroinflammatory response, long-term potentiation, and spatial memory in amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) transgenic mice using biochemical, electrophysiological, and behavioral tests. Chronic oral administration of isoorientin to APP/PS1 mice at 8 months of age attenuated multiple AD pathogenic hallmarks in the brains, including GSK-3β overactivation, tau hyperphosphorylation, Aβ deposition, and neuroinflammation. For neuroinflammation, isoorientin treatment reduced the number of activated microglia associated with Aβ-positive plaques, and in parallel reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory factors in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. Strikingly, isoorientin reversed deficits in synaptic long-term potentiation and spatial memory relevant to cognitive functions. Together, the findings suggest that isoorientin is a brain neuroprotector and may be a promising drug lead for treatment of AD and related neurodegenerative disorders.","Tan, Xiaoqin; Liang, Zhibin; Li, Yingui; Zhi, Yingkun; Yi, Lang; Bai, Shasha; Forest, Kelly H; Nichols, Robert A; Dong, Yan; Li, Qing X",Behavioural brain research,318,31

RECENT FINDINGS Solvent detergent-treated pooled plasma has proved to be well suited for the production of pathogen-reduced ABO-universal plasma. One such product, Bioplasma FDP, was licensed in South Africa in 1994 and has since 1996 been in successful clinical use. A clinical study with this product and two studies with the European product, Uniplas, have confirmed the efficacy and safety of pathogen-reduced ABO-universal plasma. SUMMARY Pooling of plasma enables the production of ABO-universal plasma. Pathogen reduction with solvent detergent eliminates lipid-enveloped viruses, whereas neutralizing antibodies in the plasma pool and nucleic acid amplification testing ensures the safety for recognized nonlipid-enveloped viruses. Pooling also eliminates transfusion-associated acute lung injury (the leading cause of plasma transfusion-related death), reduces immunologic/allergic adverse events by 60-80% and standardizes plasma protein content. Thus, in addition to ABO compatibility, pathogen-reduced ABO-universal plasma has important supplementary benefits that improve the product's cost-effectiveness.","Solheim, Bjarte G; Chetty, Rangini; Flesland, Oystein",Current opinion in hematology,318,1

She underwent laparotomy with small bowel resection and primary closure of her abdomen. There was total eventration of her bowel through the suture line 9 days after surgery. She underwent a second laparotomy that revealed no signs of peritonitis or turbid fluid. Her abdomen was closed with a 15 × 10 cm Permacol™ implant sutured sublay with prolene sutures. Her postoperative period was unremarkable. After a follow-up period of 3 years and 2 months, there was no sign of recurrent hernia or wound contamination. CONCLUSION We suggest that Permacol™ mesh can be considered an efficient alternative to primary closure or synthetic mesh in geriatric patients with contaminated abdominal wall defects.","Melnik, Idit; Goldstein, Dimitry; Yoffe, Boris",Journal of medical case reports,318,2

Molecular clocks are widely used to reveal the recent evolutionary histories of viruses but may severely underestimate their longer-term origins because of the inverse correlation between inferred rates of evolution and the timescale of their measurement. Here, we provide a predictive mechanistic model that readily explains the rate decay phenomenon over a wide range of timescales and recapitulates the ubiquitous power-law rate decay with a slope of -0.65. We show that standard substitution models fail to correctly estimate divergence times once the most rapidly evolving sites saturate, typically after hundreds of years in RNA viruses and thousands of years in DNA viruses. Our model successfully recreates the observed pattern of decay and explains the evolutionary processes behind the time-dependent rate phenomenon. We then apply our model to re-estimate the date of diversification of genotypes of hepatitis C virus to 423,000 (95% highest posterior density [HPD]: 394,000-454,000) years before present, a time preceding the dispersal of modern humans out of Africa, and show that the most recent common ancestor of sarbecoviruses dates back to 21,000 (95% HPD: 19,000-22,000) years ago, nearly thirty times older than previous estimates. This creates a new perspective for our understanding of the origins of these viruses and also suggests that a substantial revision of evolutionary timescales of other viruses can be similarly achieved.","Ghafari, Mahan; Simmonds, Peter; Pybus, Oliver G; Katzourakis, Aris",Current biology : CB,318,27

This study evaluated 111In-DANBIRT for the visualization of atherosclerotic plaque inflammation in mice. METHODS AND RESULTS ApoE-/- mice, fed an atherogenic diet up to 20 weeks (n = 10), were imaged by SPECT/CT 3 hours post injection of 111In-DANBIRT (~ 200 pmol, ~ 40 MBq). Focal spots of 111In-DANBIRT were visible in the aortic arch of all animals, with an average Target-to-Background Ratio (TBR) of 1.7 ± 0.5. In vivo imaging results were validated by ex vivo SPECT/CT imaging, with a TBR up to 11.5 (range 2.6 to 11.5). Plaques, identified by Oil Red O lipid-staining on excised arteries, co-localized with 111In-DANBIRT uptake as determined by ex vivo autoradiography. Subsequent histological processing and in vitro autoradiography confirmed 111In-DANBIRT uptake at plaque areas containing CD68 expressing macrophages and LFA-1 expressing inflammatory cells. Ex vivo incubation of a human carotid endarterectomy specimen with 111In-DANBIRT (~ 950 nmol, ~ 190 MBq) for 2 hours showed heterogeneous plaque uptake on SPECT/CT, after which immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated co-localization of 111In-DANBIRT uptake and CD68 and LFA-1 expressing cells. CONCLUSIONS Our results indicate the potential of radiolabeled DANBIRT as a relevant imaging radioligand for non-invasive evaluation of atherosclerotic inflammation.","Meester, E J; Krenning, B J; de Blois, R H; Norenberg, J P; de Jong, M; Bernsen, M R; Van der Heiden, K",Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology,318,5

In 234 flocks that were sampled, strains from 10 different IBV genotypes were detected: the 793B genotype was detected most frequently, followed by QX, Massachusetts (Mass) and the Xindadi-like strains. Strains belonging to the Q1, Ark, D274, D1466, Italy-02 and B1648 genotypes were detected as well, although less frequently. The separate sampling of tracheas and kidneys for IBV detection using reverse transcriptase PCR was very useful, as different genotypes or significant differences in sequences of the same genotype were detected between both organs. The data of this survey also provided valuable information about the replication of IBD vaccines and subsequent infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) antibody responses under field conditions. The detection of five non-vvIBDV field strains of two different genotypes shows the presence of non-vvIBDV non-vaccine strains, which can easily be undetected in Europe due to the focus on sampling of clinically ill birds. Detection of vaccine virus in the bursa and antibody response to the IBD vaccination in flocks that had been vaccinated by the drinking water with a live attenuated vaccine compared to a vaccination in the hatchery using an immune-complex vaccine showed a delayed replication of the vaccines that had been applied by the drinking water, indicating mistakes in the timing and/or application of the vaccines.","de Wit, J J; Cazaban, C; Dijkman, R; Ramon, G; Gardin, Y",Avian pathology : journal of the W.V.P.A,318,1

Exercise has been shown to improve health generally and may be effective in reducing the occurrence, severity and duration of acute respiratory infections. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the effectiveness of exercise for altering the occurrence, severity or duration of acute respiratory infections. SEARCH METHODS We searched CENTRAL (2014, Issue 6), MEDLINE (1948 to July week 1, 2014), EMBASE (2010 to July 2014), CINAHL (1981 to July 2014), LILACS (1982 to July 2014), SPORTDiscus (1985 to July 2014), PEDro (searched on 11 July 2014), OTseeker (searched on 11 July 2014), the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov (searched on 11 July 2014). SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs of exercise for ARIs in the general population. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently extracted data from the included trials using a standard form. We contacted trial authors to request missing data. One review author entered data and a second review author checked this. There were sufficient differences in the populations trialled and in the nature of the interventions to use the random-effects model (which makes fewer assumptions than the fixed-effect model) in the analysis. MAIN RESULTS We included 11 trials involving 904 adults, published between 1990 and 2014. Eight studies were conducted in the USA, and one each in Canada, Spain and Turkey. Sample sizes ranged from 20 to 154 participants aged between 18 and 85 years old. The proportion of female participants varied between 52% and 100%. The duration of follow-up in the studies varied from seven days to 12 months. The exercise type most prescribed for the intervention was aerobic (walking in 70% of the studies, or bicycle riding or treadmill) at least five times a week. Duration was 30 to 45 minutes at moderate intensity. Participants were supervised in 90% of the studies.For four of the primary outcomes the results did not differ significantly and all were low-quality evidence (number of ARI episodes per person per year, rate ratio 0.91 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59 to 1.42); proportion of participants who experienced at least one ARI over the study period, risk ratio 0.76 (95% CI 0.57 to 1.01); severity of ARI symptoms, mean difference (MD) -110 (95% CI -324 to 104); and number of symptom days in the follow-up period, MD -2.1 days (95% CI -4.4 to 0.3)). However, one primary outcome, the number of symptom days per episode of illness, was reduced in those participants who exercised (MD -1.1 day, 95% CI -1.7 to -0.5, moderate-quality evidence).We found no significant differences for the secondary outcomes (laboratory parameters (blood lymphocytes, salivary secretory immunoglobulin and neutrophils); quality of life outcomes; cost-effectiveness and exercise-related injuries).There was good adherence to the intervention with no difference between the exercise and non-exercise groups.We rated the quality of evidence for the primary outcomes as low for most outcomes using the GRADE criteria: allocation concealment was not reported and there was a lack of blinding; in addition, there was imprecision (the CI is very wide because of a small number of participants) and inconsistency, which may be due to differences in study design. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS We cannot determine whether exercise is effective at altering the occurrence, severity or duration of acute respiratory infections. One analysis of four trials suggests that the number of days of illness per episode of infection might be reduced by exercise.

Larger studies, with less risk of bias from patient selection, blinding of outcomes assessors, reporting of all outcomes measured and with registration of study protocols, are required to settle the question.","Grande, Antonio Jose; Keogh, Justin; Hoffmann, Tammy C; Beller, Elaine M; Del Mar, Chris B",The Cochrane database of systematic reviews,318,1

METHODS In this multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial, 222 symptomatic subjects with incompetent great saphenous veins were assigned to either cyanoacrylate closure or radiofrequency ablation. The primary endpoint, complete closure of the target great saphenous vein, was determined using duplex ultrasound examination starting from three-month visit. RESULTS At month 36, the great saphenous vein closure rates were 94.4% for the cyanoacrylate closure group and 91.9% for the radiofrequency ablation group. Stable improvement in symptoms and quality of life was observed in both groups. Adverse event rates between the 24- and 36-month visits were similar between the groups as were serious adverse events which were infrequent and judged unrelated to either the device or the procedure in both groups. CONCLUSIONS This trial continues to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of cyanoacrylate closure for the treatment of great saphenous vein incompetence with great saphenous vein closure rate at 36 months similar to that of radiofrequency ablation, indicating non-inferiority of cyanoacrylate closure to radiofrequency ablation. The improvement in quality of life outcomes were also sustained and similar between the two treatment groups.","Morrison, Nick; Kolluri, Raghu; Vasquez, Michael; Madsen, Monte; Jones, Andrew; Gibson, Kathleen",Phlebology,318,29

Poor visual function related to cataracts is also a risk factor for falls and traffic accidents, which may lead to hospital admissions and limit independence. Objective To evaluate patients' satisfaction, visual functions and spectacle independence among patients in the Central Region of Ghana who had cataract surgery in one eye. Methods A hospital-based prospective cohort study was carried out on 146 patients booked for cataract surgery: 16 were lost through follow-ups whilst 130 completed the study. Visual functions including visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, stereopsis and colour vision were assessed before and after a month of cataract surgery. Objective and subjective refractions were performed to determine the post-surgery refractive status of the participants. Participants completed the NEI-VFQ 25 questionnaire and the scores obtained were used as a construct of their satisfaction. Results The NEI-VFQ 25 questionnaire scores indicated patients' satisfaction was high with an average quality of life score of 77.46. Patients satisfaction was strongly correlated with contrast sensitivity (r=0.653, p<0.001) but moderately correlated with visual acuity (r=-0.554, p<0.001), stereopsis (r=0.490, p<0.001) and colour vision (r=0.466, p<0.001). Contrast sensitivity was a better predictor of patients' satisfaction than visual acuity and stereopsis. Spectacle independence at distance was achieved in only 44.6% of the participants and 5.4% at near. There was a significant (p>0.001) association between spectacle independence and the two types of cataract surgery performed which included Small Incision Cataract Surgery (SICS) and Extracapsular Cataract Extraction (ECCE). Among those who were spectacle independent, 53.4% of them were low vision patients. Conclusion Satisfaction of patients after cataract surgery was high but was greatly influenced by visual functions with contrast sensitivity being a better predictor of satisfaction than visual acuity and stereopsis. Spectacle independence after cataract surgery was low at distance and extremely low at near. The type of cataract surgery performed influenced thespectacle independence.","Kyei, Samuel; Amponsah, Bio Kwadwo; Asiedu, Kofi; Akoto, Yaw Osei",African health sciences,318,1

METHODS A total of 373 medical staff from Xiangya Hospital and the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University were enrolled for this study. The General Sociological Data Questionnaire, Symptom Check-List 90 (SCL-90), and self-designed public opinion response questionnaire were used to assess general sociological data, mental health scores, and ability to respond to COVID-19 related public opinion information of medical staff. The mental health scores of medical staff with different general sociological data and public opinion information coping abilities were compared. Influential factors of mental health were analyzed. RESULTS The average score of 10 factors in SCL-90 of 373 medical staff was less than 2 points. 14.21% medical staff had one or more factor scores more than two points, including 11.26% with terror symptoms, 7.77% with compulsive symptoms, and 5.63% with anxiety. The main sources of COVID-19 information for medical staff included WeChat, microblog, Jinri toutiao, TV and radio. 66.22% medical staff regularly verified information about COVID-19 through official websites or formal channels. A great deal of COVID-19 information in WeChat could make medical staff nervous (34.05%), anxious (30.29%), and insecure (29.22%). 68.63% medical staff sometimes were worried about getting infected because they knew information about COVID-19. Different departments of medical staff, getting cough or having a fever recently, and the degree of fear of infection had an impact on the SCL-90 score of medical staff, the differences were all statistically significant (all P<0.05). Stepwise regression analysis showed that the impact of COVID-19 information on their life in WeChat, getting cough or having a fever recently, insomnia-early caused by COVID-19 information in WeChat, different departments, and the degree of fear of infection COVID-19 were the influential factors for the mental health of medical staff (all P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS During the epidemic of COVID-19, medical staff suffered from psychological problems to various degrees. It is necessary to establish a psychological assistance platform and guide the direction of public opinion correctly to promote the mental health of medical staff.","Shen, Haiyan; Wang, Huiping; Zhou, Fei; Chen, Jindong; Deng, Lu",Zhong nan da xue xue bao.

Although infrequent, both transitory and persistent adverse effects have been reported. They range from asymptomatic to severe neurological deficits that are caused directly by polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) leakage or may be related to local or general reactions not due to PMMA leakage. Transitory hypotension after the procedure has been observed, but the characteristics and etiology of this phenomenon are not defined. OBJECTIVE To describe a case of prolonged hypotension after kyphoplasty and suggest a possible mechanism. METHODS Six months after L2 kyphoplasty, a 63-year-old woman with severe osteoporosis developed a new back pain due to compression fracture of L1 and compression deformity of the superior L3 endplate. The patient underwent bilateral kyphoplasty at the L1 and L3 levels. She developed persistent hypotension for approximately 46 hours immediately after the procedure. Common causes of hypotension were ruled out and the event resolved spontaneously. RESULTS On the basis of needle placement, the temporal relationship between the procedure and blood pressure change, and the lack of other identifiable causes, thermal sympathectomy from heating of the PMMA adjacent to the paravertebral sympathetic chain is proposed as a potential mechanism. LIMITATIONS Single case report based on clinical observation. DISCUSSION Prolonged hypotension can complicate kyphoplasty at upper lumbar levels. Two days of severe hypotension has not been described as a complication of kyphoplasty. Although the mechanism is unknown, a transient thermal sympathectomy may be the cause.","Soto, Eliezer; Galperin, Mark; Portenoy, Russell K",The Clinical journal of pain,318,13

The Department of Gastroenterological Surgery and Transplantology of the Central Clinical Hospital of the Ministry of the Interior Affairs and Administration is a leading center in pancreatic oncology in Poland, where the largest number of pancreatic cancer surgeries is performed every year. Despite a significant reduction in the number of oncological beds in the period from March to December 2020 (9 beds, compared to 55 in 2019), a total of 116 surgeries were performed in the clinic in patients with pancreatic cancer. In the same period of 2019, from March to December, 180 such procedures were performed (26% more). Methods: Retrospective data analysis of medical documentation in the hospital database. Research covered he period of time from March-December 2019 and from March-December 2020. Results: The group of patients with pancreatic tumors who underwent surgical procedures form 1 Mar 2020 until 31 Dec 2020 consisted of 65 women and 51 men with a mean age 60.4 years (SD +/-13.2). 12.9% of operated patients had a history of type 2 diabetes. In our group of pts, 13 (8.8%) had a history of chronic pancreatitis. Average time of surgical procedure was 95,7 +/-36,4 minutes. The mean hospitalisation time was 12,5 +/-14,5 days. Characteristic of the 2020 study group: history of alcohol abuse (yes/ no) 4 (3.4%/96%);Tumor location: Head 56 (48.3%) Body 25 (21.5%) Tail 21 (18.1%);more than 1 location 14 (12.1 %);mean primary tumor size (cm) 3.5 +/- SD 2.2 cm;venous infiltration (yes/no) 40/76 (34% / 66%);lymph node invasion (yes/no) 59 / 57 (50.8% / 49.2%);splenectomy (yes / no) 40/76 (34% / 66%);neoadjuvant treatment (yes / no) 27/89 (23% / 77%). Type of procedures performed: Whipple surgery, 53 patients;Whipple surgery + vein reconstruction, 8 patients;Total pancreatectomy, 9 pts;Total pancreatectomy + venous reconstructions, 2;Distal pancreatic resection, 29 pts;distal pancreatic resection without spleen, 5;central pancreatic resection, 1;Frey surgery, 2;Bypass anastomosis, 5;liver metastases removal, 1;visceral nerve section, 1. In the group of 116 patients operated on for a pancreatic tumor in the “COVID-19 era”, only 6 people died, which resulted in a mortality of 5.2% Complications observed: bleeding into the peritoneal cavity, 1;shock, 2;gastrointestinal haemorrhage, 2;respiratory failure, 3;multi-organ failure, 1;pancreatic fistula, 1;lack of healing of pancreatic-intestinal anastomosis, 1;pneumonia, 5. None of the patients became infected with SARS-COV-2 during hospitalization. Conclusions: The relatively short time of hospitalisation was caused by the limited number of places in the clinic for COVID-negative patients and the necessity to quickly start up and transfer patients in good condition to other hospitals in the area. It seems that the low number of postoperative complications and low mortality are the result of a more precise selection of patients with pancreatic cancer before admission, as well as compliance with the principles of planning the procedure and the organization of the operating room work.

The evidence shows that Democrats and Republicans both made distinctions among their local, state, and federal governments, assigning them different functional responsibilities. Yet, members of the two parties did not agree on that division of intergovernmental responsibility. Rather, across a variety of issues, polarized partisan identities structured beliefs about the operation and efficacy of the American federal system's ability to contend with the spread of coronavirus. Moreover, these beliefs did not stem from prior ideological commitments or the different composition of Democratic or Republican communities. Instead, party leaders proved especially capable of shifting public attitudes on questions of federal versus state authority through their shifting rhetoric and strategic framing.

Indiscriminate suppression, the currently accepted answer, is both unsustainable long term and implausibly presupposes all interactions to carry equal weight. Transmission within a social network is determined by the topology of its graphical structure, of which the number of interactions is only one aspect. Here we deploy large-scale numerical simulations to quantify the impact on pathogen transmission of a set of topological features covering the parameter space of realistic possibility. We first test through a series of stochastic simulations the differences in the spread of disease on several classes of network geometry (including highly skewed networks and small world). We then aim to characterise the spread based on the characteristics of the network topology using regression analysis, highlighting some of the network metrics that influence the spread the most. For this, we build a dataset composed of more than 9000 social networks and 30 topological network metrics. We find that pathogen spread is optimally reduced by limiting specific kinds of social contact -- unfamiliar and long range -- rather than their global number. Our results compel a revaluation of social interventions in communicable diseases, and the optimal approach to crafting them.","Perez-Ortiz, M.; Manescu, P.; Caccioli, F.; Fernandez-Reyes, D.; Nachev, P.; Shawe-Taylor, J.",,318,13

Initial lack of information regarding the route of transmission of the virus fuelled panic buying of face masks and gloves, as well as shortages in healthcare facilities. Home-made cloth masks have become commonplace, and makers have seized upon opportunities to increase capacity by producing PPE with 3D printing. Mask designs typically incorporate flexible filament face pieces with an integrated filter, but devices to improve the fit of simple surgical face masks have also been produced, and are not burdened with such strict testing requirements. Manufacture of face shields has been a triumph for the 3D printing community, with the availability of highly optimised and tested designs which are printable on most domestic machines, comfortable to use, and keep production time to a minimum. Across the globe, these devices have been manufactured locally and delivered to nearby hospitals by volunteers. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic has spurred development in the field of distributed manufacturing, the long-awaited holy grail of home 3D printing. In the following chapter, we provide an overview of currently available 3D printed PPE, reviewing the designs for durability, ease of use, and clinical effectiveness, as well as exploring future directions for PPE manufacture by 3D printing. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Frazer, J.

However, data visualizations have a range of accessibility concerns, including visual acuity, color/contrast difficulties, color blindness, and size/scale issues. Data visualizations should therefore be designed following web standards for complex images to ensure that they are accessible to audiences with diverse needs. Key concepts: Drawing from work in professional communication and disability studies, practitioners recognize that users have varied accessibility needs. “Universal design” as a guiding principle is less helpful than targeted approaches to design that reflect actual user needs. Such targeted approaches should follow web standards for accessible design because they enable interaction with newer accessibility technologies and put more control in the hands of users. Key lessons: Follow these best practices to create visually accessible data visualizations. 1. Design the visual for accessibility by using whitespace, creating contrast, maintaining size/scale, and labeling the visual clearly. 2. Implement the visual using web standards to create semantic connections between the visual and text for both users and accessibility technologies. This goal can be achieved with textual description, overview/data/presentation context, or ARIA semantic links. 3. Test the visual for accessibility through user tests and industry-standard tools. Implications for practice: Web standards provide a blueprint for designing accessible data visualizations for online spaces, but professional communicators should be aware of the coding expertise and necessary infrastructure needed to deploy these visuals. Nevertheless, with increasing use of public-facing data visualizations to convey information on global issues, such as COVID-19, the need for these visuals to be accessible to all audiences becomes paramount.","Strantz, Adam",IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication,318,12

Between 1922 and 2020, there have been hazy and unsteady creative attempts, incipient interactions and interruptions, generational changes and exchanges, and ideological shifts which have marked the evolution of Nigerian popular music. Based on a historical-analytical approach, this article reports on a study that aimed to recollect and explore the remarkable socio-political developments, transformations and perceptions that have consistently underpinned these 98 years of popular music practices/experiences in Nigeria. As part of the study findings, these years were divided into the following four periods: the foggy years (1922–1944);the interactive-budding period (1945–1969);the liberal period (1970–1999);and the mononationalist period (2000–2020). In part, the methodology relied on the oral accounts of some elderly and middle-aged Nigerian popular music artists, entrepreneurs, enthusiasts and analysts, as well as archival resources (print and audio-visual), and the extant literature on popular music in and social history of Nigeria.

Early identification of pregnancies at risk of developing PE is crucial for implementing preventive strategies. The effectiveness of PE screening in the first trimester is widely recognized and endorsed by several guidelines, but unfortunately real-world implementation of this practice within local settings remains difficult. Methods: We performed a systematic review of the literature to understand the critical issues hampering the implementation of PE screening procedures in Italy. All studies on first trimester PE screening in the Italian population were eligible for inclusion. Key-concepts relevant for implementation of PE screening in Italy were extracted and analysed qualitatively. Results: Nine articles were selected and included. Lack of evidence concerning the topic of PE screening in Italy was shown. Major critical issues found encompassed healthcare personnel education, training of sonographers, economic coverage for biochemical markers and adjustment of algorithms based on population characteristics. Conclusions: Identification and adaptation of specific protocols to local settings and population characteristics is critical for successful implementation of early PE screening in Italy. This process has the potential to improve pregnancy outcomes and to save valuable health-care resources, particularly scarce in the COVID-19 era. There is an urgent need for research studies on specific local populations focussing on subtle details capable of maximizing PE screening uptake. This action will likely potentiate PE screening implementation reducing the burden and the cost of perinatal and maternal complications.","Amodeo, S.; Bonavina, G.; Seidenari, A.; Cavoretto, P.

Having observed that previous infection by SARS-CoV-2 but not the standard 2 doses scheme of vaccination, provided complete protection against COVID-19 to transplant recipients, we undertook this translational study to compare the cellular and humoral immune responses of these 2 groups of patients. Neutralizing anti-Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) IgG were identified as the critical immune effectors associated with protection. Generation of anti-RBD IgG was dependent upon spike-specific T follicular helper (Tfh) CD4+ T cells, which acted as limiting checkpoint. Tfh generation was impeded by high dose mycophenolate mofetil in non-responders to vaccine but not in infected patients, suggesting that increasing immunogenicity of vaccine could improve response rate to mRNA vaccine. This theory was validated in two independent prospective cohorts, in which administration of a 3rd dose of vaccine resulted in the generation of anti-RBD IgG in half of non-responders to 2 doses.","Charmetant, X.; ESPI, M.; Benotmane, I.; Heibel, F.; Buron, F.; Gautier-Vargas, G.; Delafosse, M.; Perrin, P.; Koenig, A.; Cognard, N.; Levi, C.; Gallais, F.; Maniere, L.; Rossolillo, P.; Soulier, E.; Pierre, F.; Ovize, A.; Morelon, E.; Defrance, T.; Fafi-Kremer, S.; Caillard, S.; Thaunat, O.",,318,1

A total of 12 neonates developed NEC in June-July 1998. For two of them, twin brothers, the NEC turned out to be fatal. Enterobacter sakazakii, a known contaminant of powdered milk formula, was isolated from a stomach aspirate, anal swab, and/or blood sample for 6 of the 12 neonates. A review of feeding procedures revealed that 10 of the 12 patients were fed orally with the same brand of powdered milk formula. E. sakazakii was isolated from the implicated prepared formula milk as well as from several unopened cans of a single batch. Molecular typing by arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR) confirmed, although partially, strain similarity between milk and patient isolates. No further cases of NEC were observed after the use of the contaminated milk formula was stopped. With this outbreak we show that intrinsic microbiological contamination of powdered milk formula can be a possible contributive factor in the development of NEC, a condition encountered almost exclusively in formula-fed premature infants. The use of sterilized liquid milk formula in neonatal care could prevent problems with intrinsic and extrinsic contamination of powdered milk formula.","van Acker, J; de Smet, F; Muyldermans, G; Bougatef, A; Naessens, A; Lauwers, S",Journal of clinical microbiology,318,29

The current diagnostic criteria appear inadequate, and the early diagnosis frequently remains challenging with high risk of coronary damage. This review focuses on recent data concerning Kawasaki disease etiology and pathogenesis, and emphasizes the proposal of including altered laboratory values in revised diagnostic criteria aimed at identifying patients with incomplete disease. RECENT FINDINGS Despite a timely treatment, approximately 15% of children have persistent or recurrent fever, thus requiring additional intravenous immunoglobulin, corticosteroids, immunosuppressant, and eventually biologic drugs. Recent cardiologic tests strongly suggest that endothelial damage may lead to coronary stenosis and myocardial ischemia over time, even in children apparently normal at initial cardiac evaluation. New noninvasive tools are suggested to monitor coronary artery aneurysm outcome. Giant coronary artery aneurysms still represent a severe life-threatening complication. There is as yet no agreement regarding the prevention of thrombosis and stenosis in children with giant aneurysms. SUMMARY Due to earlier recognition, aggressive medical treatment, and surgical procedures, the quality of life in patients with Kawasaki disease is significantly improved. The identification of children at high risk for coronary artery aneurysms is crucial in order to reduce the occurrence of sudden death in adolescence and early adulthood. High parameters of inflammation, anemia, and low sodium and albumin levels, along with persistent unexplained fever, should alert clinicians to suspect the disease even though all clinical symptoms are lacking.","Falcini, Fernanda",Current opinion in rheumatology,318,5

Scholarly practitioners demonstrate a lifelong commitment to excellence in practice through continuous learning, engagement in evidence-informed decision-making, contributions to scholarship, and knowledge translation. However, the specific features and requirements associated with this role are not uniform. The absence of well-defined and delineated conceptualizations of scholarly practice and the scarcity of empirical research on how scholarly practice is operationalized contribute to a lack of a shared understanding of this complex role.

However, the existence of such trade-off relationships has recently been challenged. Here, we study how a trade-off can emerge from a model that explicitly incorporates within-host dynamics. We find that the existence and the convexity of the trade-off are robust, which implies a definite level of evolutionarily stable virulence (ESV) for the parasite. However, we also show that the dependence of the ESV on parameter values may be very strong. One possible consequence of this sensitivity is that relationships between transmission and virulence observed across populations need not conform to the patterns expected on the basis of a common (fixed) trade-off. We discuss possible experiments and implications of our results for the development of virulence management strategies.","Alizon, Samuel; van Baalen, Minus",The American naturalist,318,17

The viruses also encode accessory genes, which are virus group specific and believed to play roles in virus replication and pathogenesis in vivo. Of the eight putative accessory proteins encoded by the severe acute respiratory distress syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), only two-open reading frame 3a (ORF3a) and ORF7a-have been identified in virus-infected cells to date. The ORF7b protein is a putative viral accessory protein encoded on subgenomic (sg) RNA 7. The ORF7b initiation codon overlaps the ORF7a stop codon in a -1 shifted ORF. We demonstrate that the ORF7b protein is expressed in virus-infected cell lysates and from a cDNA encoding the gene 7 coding region, indicating that the sgRNA7 is bicistronic. The translation of ORF7b appears to be mediated by ribosome leaky scanning, and the protein has biochemical properties consistent with that of an integral membrane protein. ORF7b localizes to the Golgi compartment and is incorporated into SARS-CoV particles. We therefore conclude that the ORF7b protein is not only an accessory protein but a structural component of the SARS-CoV virion.","Schaecher, Scott R; Mackenzie, Jason M; Pekosz, Andrew",Journal of virology,318,1

In addition, arterivirus and coronavirus mRNAs contain a common 5' leader sequence, derived from the genomic 5' end. The joining of this leader sequence to different segments (mRNA bodies) from the genomic 3'-proximal region presumably involves a unique mechanism of discontinuous minus-strand RNA synthesis. Key elements in this process are the so-called transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs), which determine a base-pairing interaction between sense and antisense viral RNA that is essential for leader-to-body joining. To identify RNA structures in the 5'-proximal region of the equine arteritis virus genome that may be involved in subgenomic mRNA synthesis, a detailed secondary RNA structure model was established using bioinformatics, phylogenetic analysis, and RNA structure probing. According to this structure model, the leader TRS is located in the loop of a prominent hairpin (leader TRS hairpin; LTH). The importance of the LTH was supported by the results of a mutagenesis study using an EAV molecular clone. Besides evidence for a direct role of the LTH in subgenomic RNA synthesis, indications for a role of the LTH region in genome replication and/or translation were obtained. Similar LTH structures could be predicted for the 5'-proximal region of all arterivirus genomes and, interestingly, also for most coronaviruses. Thus, we postulate that the LTH is a key structural element in the discontinuous subgenomic RNA synthesis and is likely critical for leader TRS function.","Van Den Born, Erwin; Gultyaev, Alexander P; Snijder, Eric J",RNA,318,1

This is a challenge for health systems to guarantee the execution of a set of actions whose objective is ensuring care continuity between different care levels. This studied aimed to understand the influence of the current pandemic on the continuity of care between the hospital and the community. The participants were five nurses, who gave free and informed consent to participate. Content analysis was the technique used in data analysis. Data anonymity and confidentiality were ensured, and the data was coded without identifying customers and their families. An ethic commission authorized the study. The findings shows that transitional care has become a missing care during the pandemic, due to the need to reorganize the services and teams to provide care to the COVID patients and by the limitations of visits to hospitalized elderly. Professionals note that not only the discharge preparation and caregiver training were affected, but also communication with primary health care became more difficult, with clear defragmentation in the transitional care. In the professionals’ discourse, the need to rethink ways of ensuring continuity of care emerges, with e-health interventions being seen as an opportunity to ensure the safety of the elderly and their caregivers, the articulation with colleagues in primary health care and continuity of rehabilitation care.

Recently, Mucoromycotina fine root endophyte fungi (MucFRE) were found to engage in nutritional mutualism with Lycopodiella inundata, which belongs to one of the earliest vascular plant lineages known to associate with MucFRE. The extent to which this mutualism plays a role in resilient plant populations can only be understood by examining its occurrence rate and phenological patterns. To test for prevalence and seasonality in colonization, we examined 1305 individual L. inundata roots from 275 plants collected during spring and autumn 2019 across 11 semi-natural heathlands in Britain and the Netherlands. We quantified presence/absence of fine root endophyte (FRE) hyphae and vesicles and explored possible relationships between temperature and precipitation in the months immediately before sampling. Fine root endophyte hyphae were dominant in all of the examined heathlands, and every colonized root had FRE in both cortical cells and root hairs. However, we found significant differences in colonization between the two seasons at every site. Overall, 14% of L. inundata roots were colonized in spring (2.4% with vesicles) compared with 86% in autumn (7.6% with vesicles). Colonization levels between populations were also significantly different, correlating with temperature and precipitation, suggesting some local environments may be more conducive to root and related hyphal growth. These marked seasonal differences in host-plant colonization suggest that results about FRE from single time point collections should be carefully interpreted.

The critical components of SARS-CoV-2 are the spike protein (S-protein) and the main protease (Mpro). Mpro is required for the maturation of the various polyproteins involved in replication and transcription. S-protein helps the SARS-CoV-2 to enter the host cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Since ACE2 is required for the binding of SARS-CoV-2 on the host cells, ACE2 inhibitors and blockers have got wider attention, in addition to S-protein and Mpro modulators as potential therapeutics for COVID-19. So far, no specific drugs have shown promising therapeutic potential against COVID-19. The current study was undertaken to evaluate the therapeutic potential of traditional medicinal plants against COVID-19. The bioactives from the medicinal plants, along with standard drugs, were screened for their binding against S-protein, Mpro and ACE2 targets using molecular docking followed by molecular dynamics. Based on the higher binding affinity compared with standard drugs, bioactives were selected and further analyzed for their pharmacological properties such as drug-likeness, ADME/T-test, biological activities using in silico tools. The binding energies of several bioactives analyzed with target proteins were relatively comparable and even better than the standard drugs. Based on Lipinski factors and lower binding energies, seven bioactives were further analyzed for their pharmacological and biological characteristics. The selected bioactives were found to have lower toxicity with a higher GI absorption rate and potent anti-inflammatory and anti-viral activities against targets of COVID-19. Therefore, the bioactives from these medicinal plants can be further developed as phytopharmaceuticals for the effective treatment of COVID-19.","Mondal, Priya; Natesh, Jagadish; Abdul Salam, Abdul Ajees; Thiyagarajan, Saravanamuthu; Meeran, Syed Musthapa",J Biomol Struct Dyn,318,16

A continuum mechanical description of the motion of this interface, or phase boundary, takes the form of a kinetic law which relates the thermodynamic driving force across it with its velocity in the reference configuration. For biological macromolecules immersed in a heat bath, thermally activated kinetics described by the Arrhenius law is often a good choice. Here we show that 'stick-slip' kinetics, characteristic of friction, can also arise in an overdamped bistable bar immersed in a heat bath. To mimic a rod-like biomolecule we model the bar as a chain of masses and bistable springs moving in a viscous fluid. We conduct Langevin dynamics calculations on the chain and extract a temperature dependent kinetic relation by observing that the dissipation at a phase boundary can be estimated by performing an energy balance. Using this kinetic relation we solve boundary value problems for a bistable bar immersed in a constant temperature bath and show that the resultant force-extension relation matches very well with the Langevin dynamics results. We estimate the force fluctuations at the pulled end of the bar due to thermal kicks from the bath by using a partition function. We also show rate dependence of hysteresis in cyclic loading of the bar arising from the stick-slip kinetics. Our kinetic relation could be applied to rod-like biomolecules, such as, DNA and coiled-coil proteins which exhibit structural transitions that depend on both temperature and loading rate.","Sun, Chuanpeng; Purohit, Prashant K",Int J Solids Struct,318,1

The aim was to assess intergroups differences in the clinical course with a 60-day follow-up and related analytical factors. Results: 14 patients (9,8%) died: 8 (10%) in group I and 6 (9,5%) in groups II and III. 15 (10,6%) were admitted to ICU: 2 (2,5%) from group I, 4 (28,5%) from group II and 9 (18,4%) from group III. The mean hospital stay was longer in group II and clinical outcome was not associated with treatment. Conclusions: Tocilizumab seems to be not associated with better clinical outcomes and should be reserved for clinical trial scenario, since its widespread use may result in higher rate of ICU admission and longer mean hospital stay without differences in mortality rate and potentially adverse events.","Aomar-Millán, Ismael Francisco; Salvatierra, Juan; Torres-Parejo, Úrsula; Nuñez-Nuñez, María; Hernández-Quero, José; Anguita-Santos, Francisco",,318,16

Through a realist analysis of a survey of health professionals, we have sought to identify the underlying mechanisms that have assisted Australian health services adapt to the physical separation between clinicians and patients. Methods: Using a critical realist ontology and epistemology, we undertook an online survey of health professionals subscribing to the Australian Telehealth Society newsletter. The survey had close- and open-ended questions, constructed to identify contextual changes in the operating environment for telehealth services, and assess the mechanisms which had contributed to these changes. We applied descriptive and McNemar's Chi-square analysis for the close-ended component of the survey, and a reflexive thematic analysis approach for the open-ended questions which were framed within the activity based funding system which had previously limited telehealth services to regional Australia. Results: Of the 91 respondents most (73%) reported a higher volume of telephone-based care since COVID and an increase in use of video consultations (60% of respondents). Respondents felt that the move to provide care using telehealth services had been a ""forced adoption"" where clinicians began to use telehealth services (often for the first time) to maintain health care. Respondents noted significant changes in managerial and medical culture which supported the legitimisation of telehealth services as a mode of access to care. The support of leaders and the use personal and organisational networks to facilitate the operation of telehealth service were felt to be particularly valuable. Access to, and reliability of, the technology were considered extremely important for services. Respondents also welcomed the increased availability of more human and financial resources. Conclusions: During the pandemic, mechanisms that legitimise practise, build confidence, support relationships and supply resources have fostered the use of telehealth. This ongoing interaction between telehealth services, contexts and mechanisms is complex. The adoption of telehealth access to enable physically separated care, may mark a ""new context;"" or it could be that once the pandemic passes, previous policies and practises will re-assert themselves and curb support for telehealth-enabled care.","Taylor, Alan; Caffery, Liam J; Gesesew, Hailay Abrha; King, Alice; Bassal, Abdel-Rahman; Ford, Kim; Kealey, Jane; Maeder, Anthony; McGuirk, Michelle; Parkes, Donna; Ward, Paul R",Front Public Health,318,29

Several models were tested through structural equation modelling. Moderation analyses reported that maladaptive strategies moderated positively anxiety, whereas adaptive strategies moderated negatively anxiety. Also, the best fitted mediation model found that worry about COVID-19 contagion and general anxiety was mediated by CERS in different directions. Maladaptive CERS increased anxiety, whereas adaptive CERS reduced anxiety. Age (not gender) also moderated this mediation, were younger adults presented an indirect effect only through maladaptive CERS, but older adults through both adaptive and maladaptive. Limitations are related to the study design which was a convenience sample. CERS moderated and mediated between worry about COVID-19 contagion and general anxiety.

Hospitals and intensive care units were suddenly faced with a ""tsunami"" warning requiring instantaneous implementation and escalation of disaster plans. EVIDENCE REVIEW: An evidence-based question was developed and an extensive review of the literature was completed, resulting in a structured plan for the intensive care units to manage a surge of patients critically ill with COVID-19 in March 2020. Twenty-five sources of evidence focusing on pandemic intensive care unit and COVID-19 management laid the foundation for the team to navigate the crisis. Implementation The Critical Care Services task force adopted recommendations from the CHEST consensus statement on surge capacity principles and other sources, which served as the framework for the organized response. The 4 S's became the focus: space, staff, supplies, and systems. Development of algorithms, workflows, and new processes related to treating patients, staffing shortages, and limited supplies. New intensive care unit staffing solutions were adopted. EVALUATION: Using a framework based on the literature reviewed, the Critical Care Services task force controlled the surge of patients with COVID-19 in March through May 2020. Patients received excellent care, and the mortality rate was 0.008%. The intensive care unit team had the needed respiratory and general supplies but had to continually adapt to shortages of personal protective equipment, cleaning products, and some medications. SUSTAINABILITY: The intensive care unit pandemic response plan has been established and the team is prepared for the next wave of COVID-19.","Bader, Mary Kay; Braun, Annabelle; Fox, Cherie; Dwinell, Lauren; Cord, Jennifer; Andersen, Marne; Noakes, Bryan; Ponticiello, Daniel",Crit Care Nurse,318,5

Case Summary A previously healthy 21-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital with mild COVID-19. During the course of in-hospital isolation and monitoring, he developed an alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increase, with the enzymes peaking at day 24 (ALT 15 times the upper normal limit), with preserved liver function. The liver enzyme increase occurred 20 d after the complete clinical remission of COVID-19, and ALT dynamics paralleled the increase in total antibodies against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The case was interpreted as post-COVID immune hepatitis, with extensive laboratory investigations excluding other potential causes. The hepatocytolysis remitted 20 d after the peak ALT, without further intervention, with complete recovery, but the total anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies continued to increase the next 5 mo following the acute infection. Conclusion Close attention should also be paid to young patients with mild forms of disease, and a high index of suspicion should be maintained for post-COVID complica- tions.","Drăgănescu, A.

The symptomatology and epidemic profile remain little known in this population, especially in disabled oldest-old people with chronic diseases living in nursing homes. The objective of the present study was to comprehensively describe symptoms and chronological aspects of the diffusion of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in a nursing home, among both residents and caregivers. DESIGN: Five-week retrospective cohort study. SETTING: A middle-sized nursing home in Maine-et-Loire, west of France. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-seven frail older residents (87.9 ± 7.2years; 71 % female) and 92 staff members (38.3 ± 11.7years; 89 % female) were included. MEASUREMENTS: Mass screening for SARS-CoV-2 was performed in both residents and staff. Attack rate, mortality rate, and symptoms among residents and staff infected with SARS-CoV-2 were recorded. RESULTS: The attack rate of COVID-19 was 47 % in residents (case fatality rate, 27 %), and 24 % in staff. Epidemic curves revealed that the epidemic started in residents before spreading to caregivers. Residents exhibited both general and respiratory signs (59 % hyperthermia, 49 % cough, 42 % polypnea) together with geriatric syndromes (15 % falls, 10 % altered consciousness). The classification tree revealed 100 % COVID-19 probability in the following groups: i) residents younger than 90 with dyspnea and falls; ii) residents older than 90 with anorexia; iii) residents older than 90 without anorexia but with altered consciousness. Finally, 41 % of staff members diagnosed with COVID-19 were asymptomatic. CONCLUSIONS: The pauci-symptomatic expression of COVID-19 in older residents, together with the high prevalence of asymptomatic forms in caregivers, justifies mass screening in nursing homes, possibly prioritizing residents with suggestive combinations of clinical signs including dyspnea, falls, anorexia and/or altered consciousness.","Sacco, Guillaume; Foucault, Gonzague; Briere, Olivier; Annweiler, Cédric",Maturitas,318,5

In a subgroup, we have evaluated the effect of inhaled milrinone on RV afterload and function. METHODS: Thirty-one ICU patients with COVID-19 in need of mechanical ventilation and norepinephrine infusion were prospectively included. Hemodynamic and respiratory variables were measured at the time of the echocardiographic examination and biomarkers were obtained on arrival at the ICU and then followed up routinely. Eight patients received inhaled aerosolized milrinone at a dose of 2.5 mg/hour. RESULTS: The most common echocardiographic pattern was RV dilation with or without systolic dysfunction, which was found in 62% of patients. Pulmonary acceleration time was abnormal in 55% and indices of RV systolic function, such as fractional area of change, RV strain, were abnormal in 30% and 31% of patients respectively. A cardiac index of &lt; 2.5 l/min*m2 was seen in 58% of the patients. Left ventricular ejection fraction and global left ventricular strain were impaired in 10% and 16% respectively. The correlation between echocardiographic variables and cardiac biomarkers was poor. RV afterload correlated well to the levels of D-dimer. Milrinone inhalation did not improve RV function or afterload. CONCLUSION: RV dysfunction was the most common finding. The poor correlation to cardiac biomarkers argues against extensive myocardial involvement. The lack of improvement in RV function after milrinone inhalation suggests that the most likely cause of RV dysfunction is increased RV afterload caused by pulmonary thrombosis/embolism.","Norden, N.; Lundin, E.

This essay, written in the aftermath of the January 6, 2021 vigilante anti-democratic white supremacist assault on the US Capitol, calls attention to the two-edged sword of data at play, reflecting long histories of support for and opposition to white supremacy and scientific racism. As illustrated by both past and present examples, including COVID-19, at issue are both the non-use (Edge #1) and problematic use (Edge #2) of data on racialized groups. Recognizing that structural problems require structural solutions, in this essay I propose a new two-part institutional mandate regarding the reporting and analysis of publicly-funded work involving racialized groups and health data and documentation as to why the proposed mandates are feasible. Proposal/part 1 is to implement enforceable requirements that all US health data sets and research projects supported by government funds must explicitly explain and justify their conceptualization of racialized groups and the metrics used to categorize them. Proposal/part 2 is that any individual-level health data by membership in racialized groups must also be analyzed in relation to relevant data about racialized societal inequities. A new opportunity arises as US government agencies re-engage with their work, out of the shadow of white grievance politics cast by the Trump Administration, to move forward with this structural proposal to aid the work for health equity.","Krieger, Nancy",Front Public Health,318,29

Despite between-study discrepancies, an overall consensus has emerged whereby blood group O appears associated with a lower risk of COVID-19, while non-O blood types appear detrimental. Two major hypotheses may explain these findings: First, natural anti-A and anti-B antibodies could be partially protective against SARS-CoV-2 virions carrying blood group antigens originating from non-O individuals. Second, O individuals are less prone to thrombosis and vascular dysfunction than non-O individuals and therefore could be at a lesser risk in case of severe lung dysfunction. Here, we review the literature on the topic in light of these hypotheses. We find that between-study variation may be explained by differences in study settings and that both mechanisms are likely at play. Moreover, as frequencies of ABO phenotypes are highly variable between populations or geographical areas, the ABO coefficient of variation, rather than the frequency of each individual phenotype is expected to determine impact of the ABO system on virus transmission.

Its disease burden varies by age and etiology and is time dependent. We aimed to investigate the annual and seasonal patterns in etiologies of pediatric CAP requiring hospitalization. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study in 30,994 children (aged 0-18 years) with CAP between 2010 and 2015 at 23 nationwide hospitals in South Korea. Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MP) pneumonia was clinically classified as macrolide-sensitive MP, macrolide-less effective MP (MLEP), and macrolide-refractory MP (MRMP) based on fever duration after initiation of macrolide treatment, regardless of the results of in vitro macrolide sensitivity tests. RESULTS: MP and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were the two most commonly identified pathogens of CAP. With the two epidemics of MP pneumonia (2011 and 2015), the rates of clinical MLEP and MRMP pneumonia showed increasing trends of 36.4% of the total MP pneumonia. In children < 2 years of age, RSV (34.0%) was the most common cause of CAP, followed by MP (9.4%); however, MP was the most common cause of CAP in children aged 2-18 years of age (45.3%). Systemic corticosteroid was most commonly administered for MP pneumonia. The rate of hospitalization in intensive care units was the highest for RSV pneumonia, and ventilator care was most commonly needed in cases of adenovirus pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides fundamental data to establish public health policies to decrease the disease burden due to CAP and improve pediatric health.","Lee, Eun; Kim, Chul-Hong; Lee, Yong Ju; Kim, Hyo-Bin; Kim, Bong-Seong; Kim, Hyung Young; Kim, Yunsun; Kim, Sangyoung; Park, Chorong; Seo, Ju-Hee; Sol, In Suk; Sung, Myongsoon; Song, Min Seob; Song, Dae Jin; Ahn, Young Min; Oh, Hea Lin; Yu, Jinho; Jung, Sungsu; Lee, Kyung Suk; Lee, Ju Suk; Jang, Gwang Cheon; Jang, Yoon-Young; Chung, Eun Hee; Chung, Hai Lee; Choi, Sung-Min; Choi, Yun Jung; Han, Man Yong; Shim, Jung Yeon; Kim, Jin Tack; Kim, Chang-Keun; Yang, Hyeon-Jong",BMC Infect Dis,318,8

It has had a serious adverse impact on global public health. What we know about COVID-19 is through the traditional two-dimensional CT, which requires high spatial imagination. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to apply 3D hologram with mixed reality techniques for better understanding the pulmonary lesions of COVID-19. METHODS: The study involved 60 participants, including 20 radiologists, 20 surgeons , and 20 medical students. Each of the three groups was randomly divided into two groups, 2D CT group (N=30; mean age: 29 years [rang: 19-38]; men= 20) and 3D holographic group (N=30; mean age: 30 years [range: 20-38]; men= 20). Two groups completed the same task to identify 6 cases of the lesion area of COVID-19 with a 2D CT or 3D hologram of the lung. Finally, an independent radiology professor rated the participants' performance (out of 100). All participants in two groups completed a Likert-scale questionnaire regarding the educational utility and efficiency of 3D holograms. NASA Task Load Index were completed by all participants. RESULTS: In the mixed reality group, the task score ( 91.98±2.45 ) were significantly higher than that of in the conventional group ( 74.09 ±7.59 ), with P&#8804; 0.01. With the help of 3D holograms, surgeons and medical students achieved the same score as radiologists and made obvious progress in identifying the pulmonary lesions of COVID - 19.

We included 20 consecutive, invasively ventilated patients with laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 related ARDS who underwent prone positioning in ICU as part of their management. The main outcome was the effect of prone positioning on gas exchange and respiratory mechanics. We performed Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) in a further 3 patients with SARS-CoV-2 ARDS, in order to assess lung recruitment. Secondary patient-important outcomes including ventilator free days and 28-day mortality were also recorded.Results: There was a median improvement in the PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 132 in the prone position compared to the supine position (IQR 67-228). We observed lower PaO2/FiO2 ratios in those with low (&lt;median) baseline respiratory system static compliance, compared to those with higher (&gt;median) static compliance (P&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference in respiratory system static compliance with prone positioning. Two out of three of the patients who underwent EIT studies had evidence of early recruitment (increase in tidal impedance variation) in dorsal lung regions in the prone position compared to the supine position. Conclusions: Prone positioning was effective in improving oxygenation in SARS-CoV-2 ARDS. Furthermore, poor respiratory system static compliance was common and was associated with disease severity. Improvements in oxygenation were partly due to lung recruitment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles published from March 2020 to January 2021 were reviewed. We selected those that provided the highest levels of evidence regarding risk in different aspects: screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of prostate cancer. RESULTS: We developed a classification system based on priorities, at different stages of the disease (screening, diagnosis, treatment and follow-up) to which the type of care given, in-person or telephone visits, was adapted. We established 4 options, as follows: in priority A or low, care will be given by telephone in all cases; in priority B or intermediate, if patients are considered subsidiary of an in-person visit after telephone consultation, they will be scheduled within 3 months; in priority C or high, patients will be seen in person within a margin from 1 to 3 months and in priority D or very high, patients must always be seen in person within a margin of up to 48 hours and considered very preferential.

To suggest a training approach that can be used to train medical students for the current COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: 23 studies met inclusion criteria assessing knowledge (n=18, 78.3%), attitude (n=14, 60.9%) or skill (n=10, 43.5%) following medical student disaster training. No studies assessed clinical improvement. The length of studies ranged from 1 day to 28 days, and the median length of training was 2 days (IQR=1-14). Overall, medical student disaster training programmes improved student disaster and pandemic preparedness and resulted in improved attitude, knowledge and skills. 18 studies used pretest and post-test measures which demonstrated an improvement in all outcomes from all studies. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing disaster training programmes for medical students improves preparedness, knowledge and skills that are important for medical students during times of pandemic. If medical students are recruited to assist in the COVID-19 pandemic, there needs to be a specific training programme for them. This review demonstrates that medical students undergoing appropriate training could play an essential role in pandemic management and suggests a course and assessment structure for medical student COVID-19 training.

A robust and automatic early recognition of COVID-19, via auxiliary computer-aided diagnostic tools, is essential for disease cure and control. The chest radiography images, such as Computed Tomography (CT) and X-ray, and deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can be a significant and useful material for designing such tools. However, designing such an automated tool is challenging as a massive number of manually annotated datasets are not publicly available yet, which is the core requirement of supervised learning systems. In this article, we propose a robust CNN-based network, called CVR-Net (Coronavirus Recognition Network), for the automatic recognition of the coronavirus from CT or X-ray images. The proposed end-to-end CVR-Net is a multi-scale-multi-encoder ensemble model, where we have aggregated the outputs from two different encoders and their different scales to obtain the final prediction probability. We train and test the proposed CVR-Net on three different datasets, where the images have collected from different open-source repositories. We compare our proposed CVR-Net with state-of-the-art methods, which are trained and tested on the same datasets. We split three datasets into five different tasks, where each task has a different number of classes, to evaluate the multi-tasking CVR-Net. Our model achieves an overall F1-score&accuracy of 0.997&0.998; 0.963&0.964; 0.816&0.820; 0.961&0.961; and 0.780&0.780, respectively, for task-1 to task-5. As the CVR-Net provides promising results on the small datasets, it can be an auspicious computer-aided diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of coronavirus to assist the clinical practitioners and radiologists.

In the case of enveloped viruses, this activity was assigned to the formation of a polyelectrolyte complex between an anionic species, the polyanion, and the spike cationic proteins which are, for polymer chemists, comparable to cationic polyelectrolytes. Unfortunately, in vitro antiviral activity was not confirmed in vivo, possibly because polyanions were captured by cationic blood elements before reaching target cells. Accordingly, virologists abandoned the use of polyanions for antiviral therapy. In the case of coronaviruses like SARS-CoV-2 and its mutants the game may not be over because these viruses infect cells of airways and not of blood. This communication proposes strategies to use polysulfates to attack and inhibit viral particles before they reach target cells in the airways. For this, polysulfate solutions may be administered by spray, gargling and nebulization or used to capture virus-containing droplets and aerosols by bubbling when these vectors are in the atmosphere. The technical means exist. However, biocompatibility and biofunctionality tests are necessary in the case of airways. Such tests require manipulation of pathogens, something which is beyond the competences of a biomaterialist. For this, a specialist in virology is necessary. Attempts to find one failed so far despite all-around solicitations over the past ten months and despite the fact that attacking the virus with polysulfates may complement beneficially the defensive strategies based on masks, vaccines and hospitals.","Vert, Michel",J Biomater Sci Polym Ed,318,24

The majority of postdischarge deaths were among white patients (n = 153, 21.5%), most of whom were discharged on palliative care (n = 103). Less than a quarter of patients discharged back to assisted living, skilled nursing facilities, or subacute rehabilitation facilities remained at those locations in the 60 days following discharge (n = 48). Conclusions and Implications Increased attention to postdischarge care coordination is critical to reducing negative health outcomes following a COVID-19–related hospitalization.","Robinson-Lane, Sheria G.; Sutton, Nadia R.; Chubb, Heather Yeow Raymond Y.; Mazzara, Nicholas DeMarco Kayla Kim Tae Chopra Vineet",Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,318,20

METHODS: The clinical, laboratory, and outcome data of 87 patients with COVID-19 were collected and retrospectively analyzed. Only data collected at the time of admission were used in the analysis for predictors of poor outcome. These patients were divided into two groups: the adverse prognosis group (36 patients) and the non-adverse prognosis group (51 patients). The adverse prognosis of COVID-19 patients was defined as admission to the intensive care unit or death. RESULTS: On the univariate analysis, age, white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil counts, lymphocytes count, neutrophils-to-lymphocytes ratio (NLR), interleukin-6, albumin-to-globulin ratio (AGR), albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, glutamyl transpeptidase, and blood glucose were found to be the significant predictors. On the multivariate analysis, the predictors of poor outcome of patients with COVID-19 were NLR (OR = 2.741, [95% CI = 1.02 ~ 7.35], P = .045) and IL-6 (OR = 1.405, [95% CI = 1.04 ~ 1.89, P = .025]). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve revealed that the AUC of NLR, interleukin-6, pneumonia severity index (PSI) score, and Confusion-Urea-Respiratory Rate-Blood pressure-65 (CURB-65) score were 0.883, 0.852, 0.824, and 0.782, respectively. CONCLUSION: High interleukin-6 (6 pg/mL, cuff value) and NLR (4.48, cuff value) can be used to predict poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19 on admission, thus can serve as a beneficial tool for timely identifying COVID-19 patients prone to poor outcome and reduce patient mortality through early intervention.","Shi, Si; Liu, Xiaohui; Xiao, Jinling; Wang, Hongwei; Chen, Liyan; Li, Jianing; Han, Kaiyu",J Clin Lab Anal,318,16

Limit information about the C2H2-ZF genes hinders the molecular breeding in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). RESULTS: In this study, 457 C2H2-ZFP proteins (including 253 splice variants), which contain four types of conserved domain (named Q, M, Z, and D), could be further classified into ten subsets. They were identified to be distributed in 21 chromosomes in T. aestivum. Subset-specific motifs, like NPL-, SFP1-, DL- (EAR-like-motif), R-, PL-, L- and EK-, might make C2H2-ZFP diverse multifunction. Interestingly, NPL- and SFP1-box were firstly found to be located in C2H2-ZFP proteins. Synteny analyses showed that only 4 pairs of C2H2 family genes in T. aestivum, 65 genes in B. distachyon, 66 genes in A. tauschii, 68 genes in rice, 9 genes in Arabidopsis, were syntenic relationships respectively. It indicated that TaZFPs were closely related to genes in Poaceae. From the published transcriptome data, totally 198 of 204 TaC2H2-ZF genes have expression data. Among them, 25 TaC2H2-ZF genes were certificated to be significantly differentially expressed in 5 different organs and 15 different development stages by quantitative RT-PCR. The 18 TaC2H2-ZF genes were verified in response to heat, drought, and heat & drought stresses. According to expression pattern analysis, several TaZFPs, like Traes_5BL_D53A846BE.1, were not only highly expressed in L2DAAs, RTLS, RMS, but also endowed tolerance to drought and heat stresses, making them good candidates for molecular breeding. CONCLUSIONS: This study systematically characterized the TaC2H2-ZFPs and their potential roles in T. aestivum. Our findings provide new insights into the C2H2-ZF genes in T. aestivum as well as a foundation for further studies on the roles of TaC2H2-ZF genes in T. aestivum molecular breeding.","Li, Yongliang; Sun, Aolong; Wu, Qun; Zou, Xiaoxiao; Chen, Fenglin; Cai, Ruqiong; Xie, Hai; Zhang, Meng; Guo, Xinhong",BMC Plant Biol,318,20

COVID-19 specific biomarkers of cognitive impairment are currently lacking, but there is some evidence that SARS-CoV-2 could preferentially and directly target the frontal lobes, as suggested by behavioral and dysexecutive symptoms, fronto-temporal hypoperfusion on MRI, EEG slowing in frontal regions, and frontal hypometabolism on 18F-FDG-PET imaging. We suggest that an inflammatory parainfectious process targeting preferentially the frontal lobes (and/or frontal networks) could be the underlying cause of these shared clinical, neurophysiological, and imaging findings in COVID-19 patients. We explore the biological mechanisms and the clinical biomarkers that might underlie such disruption of frontal circuits and highlight the need of standardized diagnostic procedures to be applied when investigating patients with these clinical findings.

OBJECTIVE: To collect paediatric COVID-19 cases worldwide and to summarize both clinical and imaging findings in children who tested positive on polymerase chain reaction testing for SARS-CoV-2. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Data were collected by completion of a standardised case report form submitted to the office of the European Society of Paediatric Radiology from March 12 to April 8, 2020. Chest imaging findings in children younger than 18 years old who tested positive on polymerase chain reaction testing for SARS-CoV-2 were included. Representative imaging studies were evaluated by multiple senior paediatric radiologists from this group with expertise in paediatric chest imaging. RESULTS: Ninety-one children were included (49 males; median age: 6.1 years, interquartile range: 1.0 to 13.0 years, range: 9 days-17 years). Most had mild symptoms, mostly fever and cough, and one-third had coexisting medical conditions. Eleven percent of children presented with severe symptoms and required intensive unit care. Chest radiographs were available in 89% of patients and 10% of them were normal. Abnormal chest radiographs showed mainly perihilar bronchial wall thickening (58%) and/or airspace consolidation (35%). Computed tomography (CT) scans were available in 26% of cases, with the most common abnormality being ground glass opacities (88%) and/or airspace consolidation (58%). Tree in bud opacities were seen in 6 of 24 CTs (25%). Lung ultrasound and chest magnetic resonance imaging were rarely utilized. CONCLUSION: It seems unnecessary to perform chest imaging in children to diagnose COVID-19. Chest radiography can be used in symptomatic children to assess airway infection or pneumonia. CT should be reserved for when there is clinical concern to assess for possible complications, especially in children with coexisting medical conditions.","Caro-Dominguez, Pablo; Shelmerdine, Susan Cheng; Toso, Seema; Secinaro, Aurelio; Toma, Paolo; Damasio, Maria Beatrice; Navallas, María; Riaza-Martin, Lucia; Gomez-Pastrana, David; Ghadimi Mahani, Maryam; Desoky, Sarah M; Ugas Charcape, Carlos F; Almanza-Aranda, Judith; Ucar, Maria Elena; Lovrenski, Jovan; Gorkem, Sureyya Burcu; Alexopoulou, Efthymia; Ciet, Pierluigi; van Schuppen, Joost; Ducou le Pointe, Hubert; Goo, Hyun Woo; Kellenberger, Christian J; Raissaki, Maria; Owens, Catherine M; Hirsch, Franz Wolfgang; van Rijn, Rick R",Pediatr Radiol,318,24

The most common airway-related complications of such ICU maneuvers are laryngotracheal granulomas, webs, stenosis, malacia and, less commonly, tracheal necrosis with tracheo-esophageal or tracheo-arterial fistulae. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This paper gathers the opinions of experts of the Laryngotracheal Stenosis Committee of the European Laryngological Society, with the aim of alerting the medical community about the possible rise in number of COVID-19-related laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS), and the aspiration of paving the way to a more rationale concentration of these cases within referral specialist airway centers. RESULTS: A range of prevention strategies, diagnostic work-up, and therapeutic approaches are reported and framed within the COVID-19 pandemic context. CONCLUSIONS: One of the most important roles of otolaryngologists when encountering airway-related signs and symptoms in patients with previous ICU hospitalization for COVID-19 is to maintain a high level of suspicion for LTS development, and share it with colleagues and other health care professionals. Such a condition requires specific expertise and should be comprehensively managed in tertiary referral centers.","Piazza, Cesare; Filauro, Marta; Dikkers, Frederik G; Nouraei, S A Reza; Sandu, Kishore; Sittel, Christian; Amin, Milan R; Campos, Guillermo; Eckel, Hans E; Peretti, Giorgio",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,318,10

Repressors and activators of the ACE2 and FURIN genes were identified based on the analyses of gene silencing and overexpression experiments as well as relevant transgenic mouse models. Panels of repressors (VDR; GATA5; SFTPC; HIF1a) and activators (HMGA2; INSIG1; RUNX1; HNF4a; JNK1/c-FOS) were then employed to identify existing drugs manifesting in their effects on gene expression signatures of potential coronavirus infection mitigation agents. Using this strategy, vitamin D and quercetin have been identified as putative 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) mitigation agents. Quercetin has been identified as one of top-scoring candidate therapeutics in the supercomputer SUMMIT drug-docking screen and Gene Set Enrichment Analyses (GSEA) of expression profiling experiments (EPEs), indicating that highly structurally similar quercetin, luteolin, and eriodictyol could serve as scaffolds for the development of efficient inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 infection. In agreement with this notion, quercetin alters the expression of 98 of 332 (30%) of human genes encoding protein targets of SARS-CoV-2, thus potentially interfering with functions of 23 of 27 (85%) of the SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins in human cells. Similarly, Vitamin D may interfere with functions of 19 of 27 (70%) of the SARS-CoV-2 proteins by altering expression of 84 of 332 (25%) of human genes encoding protein targets of SARS-CoV-2. Considering the potential effects of both quercetin and vitamin D, the inference could be made that functions of 25 of 27 (93%) of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells may be altered. GSEA and EPEs identify multiple drugs, smoking, and many disease conditions that appear to act as putative coronavirus infection-promoting agents. Discordant patterns of testosterone versus estradiol impacts on SARS-CoV-2 targets suggest a plausible molecular explanation of the apparently higher male mortality during the coronavirus pandemic. Estradiol, in contrast with testosterone, affects the expression of the majority of human genes (203 of 332; 61%) encoding SARS-CoV-2 targets, thus potentially interfering with functions of 26 of 27 SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. A hypothetical tripartite combination consisting of quercetin/vitamin D/estradiol may affect expression of 244 of 332 (73%) human genes encoding SARS-CoV-2 targets. Of major concern is the ACE2 and FURIN expression in many human cells and tissues, including immune cells, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 may infect a broad range of cellular targets in the human body. Infection of immune cells may cause immunosuppression, long-term persistence of the virus, and spread of the virus to secondary targets. Present analyses and numerous observational studies indicate that age-associated vitaminDdeficiency may contribute to the high mortality of older adults and the elderly. Immediate availability for targeted experimental and clinical interrogations of potential COVID-19 pandemic mitigation agents, namely vitamin D and quercetin, as well as of the highly selective (Ki, 600 pm) intrinsically specific FURIN inhibitor (a1-antitrypsin Portland (a1-PDX), is considered an encouraging factor. Observations reported in this contribution are intended to facilitate follow-up targeted experimental studies and, if warranted, randomized clinical trials to identify and validate therapeutically viable interventions to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, gene expression profiles of vitamin D and quercetin activities and their established safety records as over-the-counter medicinal substances strongly argue that they may represent viable candidates for further considerations of their potential utility as COVID-19 pandemic mitigation agents. In line with the results of present analyses, a randomized interventional clinical trial evaluating effects of estradiol on severity of the coronavirus infection in COVID19+ and presumptive COVID19+ patients and two interventional randomized clinical trials evaluating effects of vitamin D on prevention and treatment of COVID-19 were listed on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.","Glinsky, Gennadi V.",Biomedicines,318,20

We reviewed the current evidence on the transmission dynamics and on pathogenic and clinical features of COVID-19 to critically identify any gaps in the current infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines. METHODS: In this study, we reviewed global COVID-19 IPC guidelines by organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO), the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Guidelines from 2 high-income countries (Australia and United Kingdom) and from 1 middle-income country (China) were also reviewed. We searched publications in English on 'PubMed' and Google Scholar. We extracted information related to COVID-19 transmission dynamics, clinical presentations, and exposures that may facilitate transmission. We then compared these findings with the recommended IPC measures. RESULTS: Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in healthcare settings occurs through droplets, aerosols, and the oral-fecal or fecal-droplet route. However, the IPC guidelines fail to cover all transmission modes, and the recommendations also conflict with each other. Most guidelines recommend surgical masks for healthcare providers during routine care and N95 respirators for aerosol-generating procedures. However, recommendations regarding the type of face mask varied, and the CDC recommends cloth masks when surgical masks are unavailable. CONCLUSION: IPC strategies should consider all the possible routes of transmission and should target all patient care activities involving risk of person-to-person transmission. This review may assist international health agencies in updating their guidelines.","Islam, M Saiful; Rahman, Kazi M; Sun, Yanni; Qureshi, Mohammed O; Abdi, Ikram; Chughtai, Abrar A; Seale, Holly",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,318,21

These reactions are sometimes termed cytokine storm. PDE4 inhibitors (PDE4i) have anti-inflammatory properties with approved indications in inflammatory skin and joint diseases as well as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Furthermore, multiple animal models demonstrate strong anti-inflammatory effects of PDE4i in respiratory models of viral and bacterial infection and also after chemically mediated lung injury. The rationale for PDE4i use in COVID-19 patients comes from the multimodal mechanism of action with cytokine, chemokine, and other key pathway inhibition all achieved with an excellent safety profile. We highlight how PDE4i could be an overlooked treatment from the rheumatologic and respiratory armamentarium, which has potential beneficial immune-modulation for treating severe COVID-19 pneumonia associated with cytokine storms. The proposed use of PDE4i is also supported by age-related immune changes in inflammation severity in PDE4i modifiable pathways in primate coronavirus disease. In conclusion, over-exuberant anti-viral immune responses in older patients with COVID-19 may pose a substantial risk to patient survival and mitigation against such hyper-inflammation with PDE4i, especially with anti-viral agents, is a strategy that need to be pursed, especially in older patients.","Bridgewood, Charlie; Damiani, Giovanni; Sharif, Kassem; Watad, Abdulla; Bragazzi, Nicola L; Quartuccio, Luca; Savic, Sinisa; McGonagle, Dennis",Isr Med Assoc J,318,33

Specifically, we perform a scenario-based analysis on the IMF economic growth forecasts for 2020 and 2021 using a global multi-commodity agricultural market model. According to our results, the sharp decline in economic growth causes a decrease in international meat prices by 7-18% in 2020 and dairy products by 4-7% compared to a business as usual situation. Following the slowdown of the economy, biofuel prices fall strongly in 2020, followed by their main feedstocks, maize and oilseeds. Although the income losses and local supply chain disruptions associated with the pandemic undoubtedly has led to an increase in food insecurity in many developing countries, global food consumption is largely unaffected due to the inelastic demand of most agricultural commodities and the short duration of the shock. From an environmental viewpoint, the COVID-19 impacts point to a modest reduction of direct greenhouse gases from agriculture of about 1% or 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents in 2020 and 2021.","Elleby, Christian; Domínguez, Ignacio Pérez; Adenauer, Marcel; Genovese, Giampiero",Environ Resour Econ (Dordr),318,20

While access to healthcare is an obvious issue of social justice during the pandemic, language plays a covert role in processes of access and inequality. Linguistic understanding influences social participation and during an epidemic crisis, access to language plays a significant role in improving responses of affected individuals. Although English is widely accepted as a common lingua franca in the country, it excludes those who are not proficient in the language. In this article, we analyse code-switching practices, translanguaging, and increasing African language usage among ministers of parliament during official COVID-19 speeches and briefings. We argue that the growing use of multilingual resources among South African politicians carries ramifications on language politics, i.e. a shift away from an unquestioned monolingual discourse purporting English as ‘the’ lingua franca which has in the past characterised most national speeches. From this new multilingual perspective, the pandemic has effected an inward orientation rather than the previously dominating concern with international relations.

STUDY DESIGN: An anonymous survey was designed to collect data regarding demographics, duration and nature of DE symptoms, type of surgery and postoperative outcomes. Members of endometriosis patient associations in 14 countries were invited to complete the survey if they had been diagnosed with DE. Factors associated with postoperative outcomes were analyzed using Mann-Whitney U and Fisher's exact tests. RESULTS: Data was available from 136 respondents (median age 34 years). 98 % of respondents were from Europe, North America or Oceania. The most frequently reported symptoms of DE were moderate-severe pain in the upper abdomen (68 %), chest (64 %) and shoulder (54 %). Pain was right-sided in 54 %, left-sided in 11 % and bilateral in 35 %. Of 122 respondents who initially consulted a primary care physician, a gynaecology referral occurred after a median of five consultations (range 1-100). The median time between first primary care consultation and diagnosis of DE was two years (range 0-23). 31 % were diagnosed >1 year after their first gynaecology consultation (range 1-13 years), and 30 % required two or more laparoscopies before diagnosis. 116 respondents underwent surgical treatment. Postoperative data was available for 113 respondents, and 65 % reported either a significant improvement or complete resolution of symptoms. There was no significant difference in age (P = 0.19), timing of diagnosis (P = 0.59) or type of procedure (excision or ablation) (P = 0.13) between respondents who did and did not experience symptomatic relief after surgery. 61 % reported long-lasting symptomatic relief after a median of 1 year, whilst 39 % reported ongoing moderate-severe pain or have undergone further surgery for recurrent symptoms. CONCLUSION: The diagnosis and treatment of diaphragmatic endometriosis is often delayed, due to lack of awareness by patients and healthcare professionals. The diagnosis of DE requires a high index of suspicion and involvement of surgeons trained in laparoscopic liver mobilization. Recurrent symptoms are common following surgical treatment, and international collaborative studies are required to determine the long-term outcomes of this condition.","Piccus, Rachel; Mann, Christopher; Sutcliffe, Robert P",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,318,21

The number of patients and staff on site were reduced by initiating telehealth services, triaging patients, and developing a remote work plan. Communication huddles, department meetings, and supervision meetings were converted to virtual meetings. Staffing rates, patient-care productivity, and department project work were maintained. CONCLUSION: In response to COVID-19, the department developed new protocols provided information about the protocols, which might be helpful for other pediatric hospitals or outpatient settings when planning for future pandemics or other issues that challenge the ability to provide usual care. Increasing the frequency of verbal and written communication on operational topics is recommended. Primary sources of information from national organizations (eg, the American Physical Therapy Association and the American Occupational Therapy Association) can assist with determining the scope of practice and code of conduct during a pandemic. IMPACT: COVID-19 posed challenges to operations and delivery of patient care. Although this case report is specific to COVID-19, principles applied and lessons learned from this experience can be applied to other emergency situations.","Greenwood, Jonathan; Fragala-Pinkham, Maria; Dakhlian, Megan Geno; Brennan, Ellen; Ploski, Christine; Correia, Annette",Phys. ther,318,20

Mental health research has shown that prevalence rates of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are high for Black veterans compared with White veterans, and some studies suggest poorer clinical outcomes for Black veterans with PTSD. The aim of this study was to examine the impact of racial disparities longitudinally in the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) residential rehabilitation treatment programs (RRTPs). METHODS: Participants included 2,870 veterans treated nationally in VA PTSD RRTPs in fiscal year 2017. Veterans provided demographic data upon admission to the program. Symptoms of PTSD and depression were collected at admission, discharge, and 4-month follow-up. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to examine symptom change throughout and after treatment. RESULTS: Black veterans experienced attenuated PTSD symptom reduction during treatment as well as greater depression symptom recurrence 4 months after discharge, relative to White veterans. CONCLUSIONS: This study adds to the body of literature that has documented poorer treatment outcomes for Black compared with White veterans with PTSD. Although both Black and White veterans had an overall reduction in symptoms, future research should focus on understanding the causes, mechanisms, and potential solutions to reduce racial disparities in mental health treatment.","Gross, Georgina M; Smith, Noelle; Holliday, Ryan; Rozek, David C; Hoff, Rani; Harpaz-Rotem, Ilan",Psychiatr Serv,318,33

The purpose of this study was to assess the incorporation of synchronous ophthalmology telemedicine visits in a tertiary university-based ophthalmology clinic for low-income and uninsured patients in the COVID-19 era. METHODS: The records of 18 patients who were due for an in-person visit in the medically underserved patient clinic at our institute were reviewed. Patients considered high risk of ocular morbidity progression were approved to proceed with an in-person visit. Patients with non-urgent visit indications were attempted to be contacted by telephone to be offered a telemedicine telephone visit as an alternative to a postponed in-person office visit. RESULTS: Clinical triage by an attending ophthalmologist determined that 17 patients (94.4%, n = 18) had visit indications appropriate for evaluation by telemedicine. Six patients (35.3%, n = 17) were successfully contacted and offered a telemedicine visit as an alternative to a postponed in-person office visit. All 6 patients accepted, scheduled, and completed a telemedicine visit. Eleven patients (64.7%, n = 17) were not able to be successfully contacted to offer and schedule either a telemedicine visit or a postponed in-person office visit. Patients who were not able to be successfully contacted were on average younger in age and more likely to be female, Hispanic/Latino, from Latin America, with a preferred language of Spanish. CONCLUSIONS: Synchronous ophthalmology telemedicine visits can be successfully incorporated in a tertiary university-based setting for low-income and uninsured patients. The primary barrier to providing telemedicine visits in this population was the ability to successfully contact patients to offer and schedule these visits.","Adeli, Mona; Bloom, William R",J Prim Care Community Health,318,1

Social media posts provide a record of the public's attention to an outbreak. To measure the attention of Chinese netizens to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a pre-established nationally representative cohort of Weibo users was searched for COVID-19-related key words in their posts. METHODS: COVID-19-related posts (N = 1101) were retrieved from a longitudinal cohort of 52 268 randomly sampled Weibo accounts (December 31, 2019-February 12, 2020). RESULTS: Attention to COVID-19 was limited prior to China openly acknowledging human-to-human transmission on January 20. Following this date, attention quickly increased and has remained high over time. Particularly high levels of social media traffic appeared around when Wuhan was first placed in quarantine (January 23-24, 8-9% of the overall posts), when a scandal associated with the Red Cross Society of China occurred (February 1, 8%), and, following the death of Dr Li Wenliang (February 6-7, 11%), one of the whistleblowers who was reprimanded by the Chinese police in early January for discussing this outbreak online. CONCLUSION: Limited early warnings represent missed opportunities to engage citizens earlier in the outbreak. Governments should more proactively communicate early warnings to the public in a transparent manner.","Zhu, Yuner; Fu, King-Wa; Grépin, Karen A; Liang, Hai; Fung, Isaac Chun-Hai",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,318,1

The causative agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a member of the Coronaviridae family of viruses that can cause respiratory infections of varying severity. The cellular host factors and pathways co-opted during SARS-CoV-2 and related coronavirus life cycles remain ill defined. To address this gap, we performed genome-scale CRISPR knockout screens during infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-229E). These screens uncovered host factors and pathways with pan-coronavirus and virus-specific functional roles, including major dependency on glycosaminoglycan biosynthesis, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) signaling, bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis, as well as a requirement for several poorly characterized proteins. We identified an absolute requirement for the VMP1, TMEM41, and TMEM64 (VTT) domain-containing protein transmembrane protein 41B (TMEM41B) for infection by SARS-CoV-2 and three seasonal coronaviruses.

In this work, we present a thorough analysis of recent deep learning networks and training strategies carried out on a vast and challenging multicenter dataset comprising 87 patients with different diseases and gestational ages. These approaches are employed to assess the lung respiratory status from ultrasound images and are evaluated against a reference marker. The conducted analysis sheds some light on this problem by showing the critical points that can mislead the training procedure and proposes some adaptations to the specific data and task.

Research purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore how meaningful work is experienced by self-employed individuals. Motivation for the study: Research tends to focus on meaningful work from either the formally employed individual or the organisational perspective, and very little research has included the perspective of self-employed individuals. The number of employed individuals considering self-employment, however, has increased since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which triggered a global recession that has resulted in a substantial number of job losses and questionable job security in various employment sectors. Research design/approach and method: This was an interactive qualitative study to explore the experience of meaningful work for self-employed individuals. A social constructionist paradigm was adopted to study participants’ attitudes towards their work, their values and feelings, what drives them and their perceptions of meaningful work. Data was collected and analysed from a purposive sample of five self-employed individuals. Main findings: This study revealed that purpose is the primary driver in self-employed individuals’ experience of meaningful work. Purpose facilitates feeling stimulated and creative expression. Cooperation encourages participation in meaningful work. Fulfilment is the primary outcome of self-employed individuals’ experience of meaningful work. Practical/managerial implications: Self-employed individuals can create opportunities for meaningful work. This study provides an understanding of the experience of self-employed individuals when they perform work they consider meaningful and the implications thereof.

Results: Pooled data on mental health outcomes were generated from 25 cross-sectional studies: 32% anxiety (95% confidence interval (CI) = 21%-44%, n (number of studies) = 21, N (sample size) = 13 641), 40.6% stress (95% CI = 25.4%-56.8%, n = 10, N = 4204), 32% depression (95% CI = 21%-44%, n = 17, N = 12 294), 18.6% PTSD (95% CI = 4.8%-38%, n = 3, N = 638), 38.3% insomnia (95% CI = 5.8%-78.6%, n = 2, N = 261) and significant risk factors for mental ailments includes; caring for COVID-19 patients, being a female, low self-efficacy, resilience, social support and having physical symptoms (sore-throat, breathlessness, cough, lethargy, myalgia, fever). Conclusion: The study results highlighted a higher proportion of poor mental health outcomes namely, anxiety, stress, depression, PTSD and insomnia among nurses from different parts of the world. Poor mental health outcomes among nurses warrants the need to implement proactive psychological interventions to deter the collapse of health care systems in responding to the pandemic and in particular all possible efforts should be undertaken to mitigate the risk factors. Health care organizations should provide support to nurses with sufficient flexibility. The disaster preparedness plan envisaged by nations should have provisions to address the mental health of nurses. Greater investment in addressing the global shortage of nurses should be given priority in national health policies. Attractive salary packages should be offered to nurses to prevent their emigration from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).

Longitudinal follow-up studies to a later age are needed in order to increase understanding of the changes in neurodevelopmental trajectories in targeting timely intervention. The aims of this study were to investigate cognitive and motor outcomes, attention-deficit hyperactivity (ADHD) behaviour, school performance, and overall outcomes in a national cohort of ELBW children at preadolescence, and minor neuromotor impairments in a subpopulation of these children and to compare the results with those of full-term controls. The additional aim was to report the overall outcome in all ELBW infants born at 22 to 26 gestational weeks. Methods: This longitudinal prospective national cohort study included all surviving ELBW (birth weight <1000 g) children born in Finland in 1996 to 1997. No children were excluded from the study. Perinatal, neonatal, and follow-up data up to the age of 5 years of these children were registered in the national birth register. According to birth register, the study population included all infants born at the age under 27 gestational weeks. At 11 years of age general cognitive ability was tested with the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, ADHD behavior evaluated with a report from each child's own teacher (ADHD Rating Scale IV), and school performance with a parental questionnaire. An ELBW subpopulation consisting of a cohort representative children from the two university hospitals from two regions (n = 63) and the age-matched full-term born controls born in Helsinki university hospital (n = 30) underwent Movement Assessment Battery for Children and Touwen neurological examination comprising developmental coordination disorder (DCD) and minor neurological dysfunction (MND), respectively. Results: Of 206 ELBW survivors 122 (73% of eligible) children and 30 (100%) full-term control children participated in assessments. ELBW children had lower full-scale intellectual quotient than controls (t-test, 90 vs 112, P < .001), elevated teacher- reported inattention scores (median = 4.0 vs 1.0, P = .021, r = .20) and needed more educational support (47% vs 17%, OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.6-12.4, P = .02). In the subpopulation, the incidences of DCD were 30% in ELBW and 7% in control children (P = .012, OR 6.0 CI 1.3-27.9), and complex MND 12.5% and 0%, (P = .052; RR 1.1 95% CI 1.04-1.25), respectively. Of survivors born in 24 to 26 gestational weeks, 29% had normal outcome. Conclusion: As the majority of the extremely preterm born children had some problems, long-term follow-up is warranted to identify those with special needs and to design individual multidisciplinary support programs.","Tommiska, Viena; Lano, Aulikki; Kleemola, Päivi; Klenberg, Liisa; Lehtonen, Liisa; Löppönen, Tuija; Olsen, Päivi; Tammela, Outi; Fellman, Vineta",Health Sci Rep,318,21

We aimed to conduct a systemic review and meta-analysis on the reliability and sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva and deep throat sputum (DTS) compared to nasopharyngeal, combined naso/oropharyngeal, and oropharyngeal swabs. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed according to the PRISMA statement. The inclusion criteria were studies that specifically assessed a sample of saliva or DTS with at least one other respiratory specimen in patients with COVID-19 infection, based on RT-PCR tests. The DerSimonian-Laird bivariate random-effects model analysis performed using STATA software with the ""metaprop"" package. RESULTS: From 1598 studies, we retrieved 33 records, of which 26 studies were included for quantitative analysis. We found an overall sensitivity of 97% (95% confidence interval [CI], 86-100) for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, 92% (95% CI, 80-99) for double naso/oropharyngeal swabs, 87% (95% CI, 77-95) for nasopharyngeal swabs, 83% (95% CI, 77-89) for saliva, 82% (95% CI, 76-88) for DTS, and 44% (95% CI, 35-52) for oropharyngeal swabs among symptomatic patients, respectively. Regardless of the type of specimens, the viral load and sensitivity in the severe patients were higher than mild and in the symptomatic patients higher than asymptomatic cases. CONCLUSIONS: The present review provides evidence for the diagnostic value of different respiratory specimens and supports saliva and DTS as promising diagnostic tools for first-line screening of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the methods of sampling, storing, and laboratory assay need to be optimized and validated before introducing as a definitive diagnosis tool. Saliva, DTS, and nasopharyngeal swab showed approximately similar results, and sensitivity was directly related to the disease severity. This review revealed a relationship between viral load, disease severity, and test sensitivity. None of the specimens showed appropriate diagnostic sensitivity for asymptomatic patients.","Khiabani, Kazem; Amirzade-Iranaq, Mohammad Hosein",Am. j. infect. control,318,22

One of the causes of DM, mainly type 2 is unhealthy eating habits, including white sugar, which contains almost no active compounds except sucrose. The active compounds in sugarcane juice such as ferulic acid, gallic acid, 4-Hydroxy benzoate acid, and vanillic acid, which are suspected besides alpha-amylase inhibitors, also have potential as anti COVID-19. The purpose of this research is to extract secondary metabolites from sugarcane juice, determine TPC and TFC, and to know in silico activity of the active compounds in sugarcane juice as an alpha-amylase inhibitor and binding position to the active site of the spike protein. The results have shown that TPC and TFC in sugarcane juice are 0.5501% and 0.4480%. The in silico analysis has proven that the ferulic acid compound is bonded to the alpha-amylase binding site as acarbose did. Gallic acid, 4-hydroxy benzoic acid, and vanillic acid compounds are bonded to RBD of S protein COVID-19 as chloroquine did, with various binding affinity.

The spread of COVID-19 is increasing day by day, imposing human lives and economy at risk. Due to the increased enormity of the number of COVID-19 cases, the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is imperative in the current scenario. AI would be a powerful tool to fight against this pandemic outbreak by predicting the number of cases in advance. Deep learning-based time series techniques are considered to predict world-wide COVID-19 cases in advance for short-term and medium-term dependencies with adaptive learning. Initially, the data pre-processing and feature extraction is made with the real world COVID-19 dataset. Subsequently, the prediction of cumulative confirmed, death and recovered global cases are modelled with Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (SLSTM) and Prophet approaches. For long-term forecasting of COVID 19 cases, multivariate LSTM models employed. The performance metrics are computed for all the models and the prediction results are subjected to comparative analysis to identify the most reliable model. From the results, it is evident that the Stacked LSTM algorithm yields higher accuracy with an error of less than 2% compared to the other considered algorithms for the studied performance metrics. Country-specific analysis of India and city-specific analysis of Chennai COVID-19 cases are predicted and analyzed in detail. Also, statistical hypothesis analysis and correlation analysis are done on the COVID 19 datasets by including the features like temperature, rainfall, population, total infected cases, area and population density during the months of May, June, July and August to find out the best suitable model. Further, Practical significance of predicting COVID-19 cases is elucidated in terms of assessing pandemic characteristics, scenario planning, optimization of models and supporting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).","Devaraj, Jayanthi; Madurai Elavarasan, Rajvikram; Pugazhendhi, Rishi; Shafiullah, G M; Ganesan, Sumathi; Kaarthic Jeysree, Ajay; Ahmad Khan, Irfan; Hossain, Eklas",Results Phys,318,21

In this report, an epidemiological and serological investigation of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in an Italian nursing home is described. Among the residents, all but one (19/20) were regularly vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2. In mid-February 2021, a non-vaccinated staff member of the nursing home was diagnosed with the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Following the outbreak investigation, a total of 70% (14/20) of residents aged 77–100 years were found positive. The phylogenetic analysis showed that the outbreak was caused by the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern 202012/01 (the so-called “UK variant”). However, all but one positive subjects (13/14) were fully asymptomatic. The only symptomatic patient was a vaccinated 86-year-old female with a highly compromised health background and deceased approximately two weeks later. The subsequent serological investigation showed that the deceased patient was the only vaccinated subject that did not develop the anti-spike protein antibody response, therefore being likely a vaccine non-responder. Although the available mRNA SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was not able to prevent several asymptomatic infections, it was able to avert most symptomatic disease cases caused by the SARS-CoV-2 variant of concern 202012/01 in nursing home residents.","Orsi, Andrea Domnich Alexander Pace Vanessa De Ricucci Valentina Caligiuri Patrizia Bottiglieri Livio Vagge Rosanna Cavalleri Maurizio A.; Orlandini, Francesco Bruzzone Bianca Icardi Giancarlo",Vaccines,318,22

Methods: The questionnaire, reported in Annex I, consisting of 30 questions and submitted electronically through Google Forms, was administered in Italian to healthcare personnel of the Teaching hospi-tal Umberto I and Sapienza University of Rome between September and October 2020. The questionnaire analyzed the characteristics of the sample and investigated the perception and attitude of healthcare personnel towards seven different aspects of Smart Working. A descriptive analysis of the sample examined and an internal consistency analysis was performed through the use of the SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science) program version 25.0. Cronbach's alpha statistical indicator, which measures reprodu-cibility over time, reliability, and homogeneity of questions, was used for the analysis. Results: A total number of 53 health care providers answered the online questionnaire. The majority of the respondents were female (60.4%); 73.6% of respondents reported having a college degree or a higher educational level. The analysis showed an overall standardized Cronbach's Alpha of 0.709, which corresponds to a good reliability. In the items analysis, the alpha value ranged from a minimum of 0.652 to a maximum of 0.756.","Chiappetta, M; Mazzalai, E; Sernia, S; La Torre, G",Clin Ter,318,17

The outbreak is managed by a combination of disease containment via public health measures and supportive care for those who are affected. To date, there is no specific anti-COVID-19 treatment. However, the urgency to identify treatments that could turn the tide has led to the emergence of several investigational drugs as potential candidates to improve outcome, especially in the severe to critically ill. While many of these adjunctive drugs are being investigated in clinical trials, professional bodies have attempted to clarify the setting where the use of these drugs may be considered as off-label or compassionate use. This review summarizes the clinical evidence of investigational adjunctive treatments used in COVID-19 patients as well as the recommendations of their use from guidelines issued by international and national organizations in healthcare.","Xu, Xinni; Ong, Yew Kwang; Wang, De Yun",Mil Med Res,318,2

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of drug therapy on the risk of death in patients with COVID­19. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and major preprint platforms were searched to retrieve articles published until April 7, 2020. Subsequently, the effects of specific drug interventions on mortality of patients with COVID­19 were assessed. Odds ratios (ORs) and relative risks (RRs) with corresponding 95% CIs were pooled using random effects models. RESULTS: Of 3421 references, 6 studies were included. Pooled results from retrospective studies revealed that antiviral agents may contribute to survival benefit (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.17-0.99; P = 0.048; I2 = 82.8%), whereas a single randomized controlled trial found no effects of an antiviral agent on mortality (RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.45-1.3; P = 0.33). Glucocorticoid use led to an increased risk of death (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.44-4.1; P = 0.001; I2 = 61.9%). Antibiotics did not significantly affect mortality (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.67-1.89; P = 0.64; I2 = 0%). Similarly, intravenous immunoglobulin had a nonsignificant effect on mortality (OR, 2.66; 95% CI, 0.72-9.89; P = 0.14; I2 = 93.1%). CONCLUSIONS: With the varied heterogeneities across interventions, the current evidence indicated a probable survival benefit from antiviral agent use and a harmful effect of glucocorticoids in patients with COVID­19. Neither any of antibiotics nor intravenous immunoglobulin were associated with survival benefit in this population.","Pei, Lei; Zhang, Sheng; Huang, Linxi; Geng, Xuqiang; Ma, Linhao; Jiang, Weiwei; Li, Wenfang; Chen, Dechang",Pol Arch Intern Med,318,2

Nurses deliver the highest level of functioning in the health care team. Nurses need to understand the COVID-19 preparedness and response process. Therefore, it becomes very important to assess a nurse's knowledge of preparedness and response to Corona Virus Disease (Covid-19). Methods: The research approach was quantitative in nature by using the descriptive cross-sectional survey among nurses working under MOH Hospitals in Najran region, KSA. The sample participated in the survey was 594 and the tool used for the study was a modified questionnaire on Nurse's preparedness and response to COVID-19. The questionnaire contained five parts and the first part included basic information of the nurses and the second part was composed of yes or no questions assessing the nurse's Knowledge on COVID-19 preparedness and the third part composed of facility and response readiness to triage screening and the fourth part consist of nurses preparedness and readiness on COVID and fifth part composed of nurse's preparedness and readiness on peroneal protective equipment's and the study was approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB). Data was presented by using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results: Our study results found that overall knowledge of COVID preparedness was adequate. However, the nurse's preparedness on personal protective equipment was moderate. Majority of respondents were Registered Nurses 587(98.9%)and most of the respondents were employed by the Ministry of Health 586(98.7%)and the nurse's knowledge of preparedness was 456(76.8%) and the facilities preparedness and response readiness was 549(92.4) and adequate supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) 519(87. 3%).

Materials and Methods: This study included patients who were admitted to or referred to the hospital between 20 March and 20 June 2020, diagnosed with COVID-19 via a positive RT-PCR from nasal and pharyngeal swab samples. The troponin I level was measured from each patient. Medical records of patients were retrospectively reviewed and analyzed. Results: A hundred and five patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalized, or who died in the hospital due to COVID-19, were included in this study. There was a statistically significant difference between the troponin I high and low level groups in terms of age (years), BMI, shortness of breath (SB), oxygen saturation (%), hypertension, length of stay in the ICU; and for mortality, C-reactive protein, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, hemoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase, ferritin, D-dimer, creatine kinase-MB, prothrombin time, calcium, and 25-hydroxy vitamin 25(OH)D3 (all p < 0.05). In the logistic analyses, a significant association was noted between troponin I and the adjusted risk of mortality. A ROC curve analysis identified troponin I values > 7.8 pg/mL as an effective cut-off point in mortality for patients with COVID-19. A troponin I value of higher than 7.8 pg/mL yielded a sensitivity of 78% and a specificity of 86%. Conclusions: The hospital mortality rate was higher among patients diagnosed with COVID-19 accompanied by troponin levels higher than 7.8 pg/mL. Therefore, in patients diagnosed with COVID-19, elevated troponin I levels >7.8 pg/mL can be considered an independent risk factor for mortality.","Özyilmaz, Sinem; Ergün Alis, Esra; Ermis, Emrah; Allahverdiyev, Samir; Uçar, Hakan",Medicina (Kaunas),318,16

The use of cloth masks for general public use is being debated, and is in flux. We searched the MEDLINE and EMBASE databases and Google for articles reporting the filtration properties of flat cloth or cloth masks. We reviewed the reference lists of relevant articles to identify further articles and identified articles through social and conventional news media. We found 25 articles. Study of protection for the wearer used healthy volunteers, or used a manikin wearing a mask, with airflow to simulate different breathing rates. Studies of protection of the environment, also known as source control, used convenience samples of healthy volunteers. The design and execution of the studies was generally rigorously described. Many descriptions of cloth lacked the detail required for reproducibility; no study provided all the expected details of material, thread count, weave, and weight. Some of the homemade mask designs were reproducible. Successful masks were made of muslin at 100 threads per inch (TPI) in 3 to 4 layers (4-layer muslin or a muslin-flannel-muslin sandwich), tea towels (also known as dish towels), made using 1 layer (2 layers would be expected to be better), and good-quality cotton T-shirts in 2 layers (with a stitched edge to prevent stretching). In flat-cloth experiments, linen tea towels, 600-TPI cotton in 2 layers, and 600-TPI cotton with 90-TPI flannel performed well but 80-TPI cotton in 2 layers did not. We therefore recommend cotton or flannel at least 100 TPI, at least 2 layers. More layers, 3 or 4, will provide increased filtration but there is a trade-off in that more layers increases the resistance to breathing.

Whether it had any impact on coronary angiography (CA) volume or on mechanical support device use for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and post-STEMI mechanical complications in Canada is unknown. Methods: We administered a Canada-wide survey to all Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory Directors seeking the volume of CA for STEMI performed during 01/03/2020-31/05/2020 (pandemic period) and from two control periods (01/03/2019-31/05/2019 and 01/03/2018-31/05/2018). The number of left ventricular support devices used, as well as the number of ventricular septal defects or papillary muscle rupture cases diagnosed, were also recorded. We also assessed if the number of COVID-19 cases recorded in each province was associated with STEMI CA volume. Results: Forty-one out of 42 Canadian catheterization laboratories (98%) provided data. There was a modest but statistically significant 16% reduction (Incidence Rate Ratio or IRR 0.84; 95%CI 0.80-0.87) in CA for STEMI during the first wave of the pandemic compared to control periods. IRR was not associated with provincial COVID-19 caseload. We observed a 26% reduction (IRR 0.74; 95%CI 0.61-0.89) in the use of intra-aortic balloon pump in STEMI. Use of Impella® and mechanical complications from STEMI were exceedingly rare. Conclusion: We observed a modest 16% decrease in CA for STEMI during the pandemic first wave in Canada, lower than reported in other countries.

The current study aims to shed light on modifiable paths to perinatal psychological distress by testing whether there is an indirect effect of IU on psychological symptoms through a perceived reduction in mindfulness during the pandemic. Methods: Pregnant individuals (67%, n = 133) and new mothers within 6 months postpartum (33%, n = 66) participated in a cross-sectional online survey assessing IU, current and retrospective pre-pandemic mindfulness (FFMQ), and psychological symptoms (anxiety, depression, somatization; BSI). Perceived change in mindfulness was captured by including retrospective mindfulness as a covariate in the PROCESS macro used for analyses. Results: Tests of the direct association between mindfulness, IU, and psychological symptoms showed significant effects of IU (b = 0.46, SE = 0.064; p < .001) and perceived decrease in mindfulness during the pandemic (b = - 0.72, SE = 0.08, p < .001) on psychological symptoms (R 2 = .21-.34; F[2, 197] = 51.13-52.81, p < .001). The indirect effect of IU on symptoms via perceived decrease in mindfulness during the pandemic (b = 0.13, SE = 0.043, 95%CI [.060, .226]) was significant (R 2 = .41, F[3, 195] = 45.08, p < .001). Conclusions: Results suggest that mothers who are less able to tolerate uncertainty experience more psychological symptoms, in part due to perceived reduction in mindfulness during the pandemic. Future research should examine whether IU is a screening risk marker and target for mindfulness-based interventions to improve maternal well-being and family outcomes.","Sbrilli, Marissa D; Haigler, Katherine; Laurent, Heidemarie K",Mindfulness (N Y),318,26

According to the publicly reported data, the first case of novel corona virus in Pakistan was reported on 27th February 2020. The aim of the present study is to describe the mathematical model and dynamics of COVID-19 in Pakistan. To investigate the spread of coronavirus in Pakistan, we develop the SEIR time fractional model with newly, developed fractional operator of Atangana-Baleanu. We present briefly the analysis of the given model and discuss its applications using world health organization (WHO) reported data for Pakistan. We consider the available infection cases from 19th March 2020, till 31st March 2020 and accordingly, various parameters are fitted or estimated. It is worth noting that we have calculated the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] which shows that virus is spreading rapidly. Furthermore, stability analysis of the model at disease free equilibrium DFE and endemic equilibriums EE is performed to observe the dynamics and transmission of the model. Finally, the AB fractional model is solved numerically. To show the effect of the various embedded parameters like fractional parameter [Formula: see text] on the model, various graphs are plotted.

Much attention has been given to the disparity in maternal morbidity and mortality experienced by Black mothers. The disparity in Black lives lost from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has further highlighted the disparity in health outcomes for Black people. Although COVID-19 is a new disease, the reason for the health disparity is the same as in maternal morbidity and mortality: implicit bias and structural racism. Implicit bias among health care professionals leads to disparities in how health care is delivered. Generations of structural racism perpetuated through racial residential segregation, economic suppression, and health care inequality have normalized the poorer health outcomes for Black Americans. It is easy to dismiss these issues as someone else's problem, because health care professionals often fail to acknowledge the effect of implicit bias in their own practices. We all need to be highly critical of our own practices and look introspectively for implicit bias to find the cure. Health care organizations must invest time and resources into investigating the structural racism that exists within our own walls.","Gillispie-Bell, Veronica",Obstet Gynecol,318,24

SETTING: Raghudeep Eye Hospital, India DESIGN:: Experimental study METHODS:: 10 patients attending ophthalmic outpatient clinic(OPD) and operating room(OR) were included. Using Schlieren imaging, exhaled airflow patterns were documented with/without an N95 mask or face shield during respiratory activities. Recordings were performed with and without room air conditioning turned on. Exhaled airflow patterns in OPD and OR when using versus not using these infection control measures, as well as the impact of room air circulation on these were compared. RESULTS: There was a forward stream of exhaled air from the patient's mouth/nose during all respiratory activities. An N95 mask dampened its intensity and forward transmission. Taping the mask around the nasal bridge further reduced airflow leakage. A mechanical barrier in front of the patient's face blocked forward propagation of the exhaled airflow. Turning on a forceful and direct draft of air over the surgeon's working area dampened and diverted the exhaled airflow away from the surgeons' breathing area. This effect was particularly pronounced in the OR, with the overhead laminar airflow. CONCLUSIONS: Using a high force airflow with the draft facing downwards can dampen and divert the exhaled airflow away from healthcare providers. Using masks /mechanical barriers and taping the mask reduces potential dissemination of aerosols and thereby human and surface contamination.","Srivastava, Samaresh; Vasavada, Vaishali; Vasavada, Abhay R; Sudhalkar, Aditya; Kothari, Abhishek; Vasavada, Shail A",J. cataract. refract. surg,318,1

The purpose of this systematic review was to summarize so far available pieces of evidence documenting de novo novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) mediated spinal cord demyelinating diseases. Indeed, the spinal demyelinating disorders that have been reported in those patients who have suffered from COVID-19 rather than on the people already living with diagnosed or undiagnosed primary demyelinating disorders. METHODS: We used the existing PRISMA consensus statement. Data were collected from PubMed, NIH Litcovid, EMBASE and Cochrane library databases, as well as Pre-print servers (medRxiv, bioRxiv, and pre-preints.org), until September 10, 2020, using pre-specified searching strategies. RESULTS: The 21 selected articles were all case reports and included 11 (52%) men and 10 (48%) women. The mean age was of 46.7â¯±â¯18.0. The neurological manifestations included weakness, sensory deficit, autonomic dysfunction and ataxia. In most cases, elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein as well as lymphocytic pleocytosis were found. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in five (24%) patients, meanwhile in 13 (62%) patients, the testing was negative. Testing was not performed in two cases and, in one, data were unavailable. Nearly half of the cases (Nâ¯=â¯9) were associated with isolated long extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), whereas a combination of both LETM and patchy involvement was found in two. Only five patients had isolated short segment involvement and two patchy involvement. Furthermore, concomitant demyelination of both brain and spine was reported in six patients. Concerning the prognosis, most of the patients improved and the mortality rate was low (Nâ¯=â¯2, <10%). CONCLUSION: Spinal cord demyelination should be added to the plethora of immune mediated neurologic complications associated with COVID-19.","Mondal, Ritwick; Deb, Shramana; Shome, Gourav; Ganguly, Upasana; Lahiri, Durjoy; Benito-León, Julián",Mult Scler Relat Disord,318,30

As fezes dos cachorros-do-mato foram colhidas e examinadas diariamente para pesquisa de oocistos. No primeiro experimento, masseter e cérebro (peça inteira dos dois órgãos) colhidos de dois bovinos de aproximadamente dois anos de idade, foram picados, misturados e fornecidos às quatro raposas em dois dias consecutivos. Duas raposas eliminaram oocistos sub-esféricos não esporulados medindo 10-13µm no oitavo e nono dias pós-infecção, respectivamente. Uma das raposas eliminou oocistos por cinco e a outra nove dias. Amostras de DNA extraída dos de oocistos de cada dia de eliminação foram analisadas por PCR com primers grupo-específicos PCR-ITS-1 e espécie-especificos Nc5-NPCR. Todas as amostras foram positivas por PCR-HSP-70 e PCR-ITS-1, mas negativas por Nc5-NPCR. A sequência de nucleotídeos PCR-ITS-1 revelou 100% de identidade com seqüências homólogas de H. Heydorni. Concluímos que H. heydorni também utiliza o cachorro-do-mato (Cerdocyon thous) como hospedeiro definitivo. O cachorro-do-mato é usualmente reportado em contato com rebanhos em diversas regiões do Brasil. Então, é razoável inferir que estes carnívoros possam exercer um importante papel nos ciclos silvestre e doméstico da infecção por H. heydorni.

The resurgence in COVID-19 cases as part of the second wave is observed across Europe and the Americas. The scientific response has enabled a complete structural characterization of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-novel Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Among the most relevant proteins required by the novel coronavirus to facilitate the cell entry mechanism is the spike protein. This protein possesses a receptor-binding domain (RBD) that binds the cellular angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and then triggers the fusion of viral and host cell membranes. In this regard, a comprehensive characterization of the structural stability of the spike protein is a crucial step to find new therapeutics to interrupt the process of recognition. On the other hand, it has been suggested that the participation of more than one RBD is a possible mechanism to enhance cell entry. Here, we discuss the protein structural stability based on the computational determination of the dynamic contact map and the energetic difference of the spike protein conformations via the mapping of the hydration free energy by the Poisson-Boltzmann method. We expect our result to foster the discussion of the number of RBD involved during recognition and the repurposing of new drugs to disable the recognition by discovering new hotspots for drug targets apart from the flexible loop in the RBD that binds the ACE2.","Moreira, Rodrigo A; Guzman, Horacio V; Boopathi, Subramanian; Baker, Joseph L; Poma, Adolfo B",,318,29

Withthe public using digital technology over healthcare professionals (HCPs) for health advice, this warrants an investigation of technology use in community pharmacy, given itsprevious successful use.(2)Aim: To determine the feasibility and perceptions ofa community pharmacist (CP)-led weight managementprogramme (WMP), enhanced by a Facebook support group(FSG).Methods: A proof of concept study was conducted between January-March 2020. Recruitment was via a pharmacy,the university and a community Facebook group. Inclusioncriteria: over 18 years;overweight;no medical conditions.Participants attended face-to-face meetings (ftf) with a CPand final year pharmacy student (PS) on two occasions (0(baseline) and 4 weeks). At baseline, participants were giventhe NHS weight loss programme and set weight loss goals.During ftf, participants had height, weight, and waist circumference (WC) measurements by a CP/PS and discussed eatinghabits, exercise and alcohol. In between ftf, participants accessed the FSG (created (December 2019) and moderated bya CP). Here, they received posts about diet, exercise and motivation. Participants were to have their measurements takenftf at 8-weeks, however, COVID-19 meant participants hadto self-declare these via video call. Following the 8-week programme, participants completed a 4-section survey abouttheir experience (signing up to the service;comparison to previous weight loss attempts;the FSG and overall perceptions).Question types included multiple choice, Likert scale andfree text comments. Data were analysed in Excel (MicrosoftCorporation 2016) with changes in height, weight, waist circumference, alcohol and exercise being calculated.Results: Fifty-five participants were recruited. 18 were lostto follow-up, most (n=12/18) citing COVID-19. Of the 37participants remaining (70.3% female, mean age=37 years),22 were obese, the rest overweight. Mean weight loss, meanpercentage weight loss and mean WC reduction at 4-weekswas 1.6 kg (SD+/-1.7 kg), 1.8% (SD+/-1.9%) and 2 cm(SD+/-1.96 cm) respectively. At week 8 measurements wereself-declared. Mean weight loss at 8-weeks from baseline was2.7 kg (SD +/-2.6 kg) and mean percentage weight loss was3% (SD+/-3%). Only five participants' self-declared WCmeasurements at 8-weeks with mean reduction being 3.6 cm.Five participants moved to healthier BMI classifications byweek 8. All participants accessed the FSG at least weeklywith 13 accessing it daily. Diet posts were the most popular(n=20/37). Participants learned about portion control andincreasing fruits/vegetables intake. All participants wouldrecommend the programme to their friends/family.Conclusion: An 8-week CPWMP, enhanced with FSG,supported participants to lose a mean of 3% body weight.Participants accessed the page regularly and were positive about its usefulness. One limitation was that theCOVID-19 lockdown prevented the 8-week ftf, therefore,self-declared measurements were used. The pandemic hashighlighted the importance of pharmacy embracing technology for service delivery, particularly when in-personcontact is limited. The implication of this study is that itprovides proof that the concept of digital service deliverycould work in practice.","Crilly, P.; Chibueze, E.; Khan, M.; Modha, J.; Satwaha, S.; Sherpa, N.; Kayyali, R.",International Journal of Pharmacy Practice,318,29

In this paper we propose new inference procedures for the indirect effect in the presence of high-dimensional mediators for linear mediation models. We develop methods for both incomplete mediation, where a direct effect may exist, as well as complete mediation, where the direct effect is known to be absent. We prove consistency and asymptotic normality of our indirect effect estimators. Under complete mediation, where the indirect effect is equivalent to the total effect, we further prove that our approach gives a more powerful test compared to directly testing for the total effect. We confirm our theoretical results in simulations, as well as in an integrative analysis of gene expression and genotype data from a pharmacogenomic study of drug response. We present a novel analysis of gene sets to understand the molecular mechanisms of drug response, and also identify a genome-wide significant noncoding genetic variant that cannot be detected using standard analysis methods.","Zhou, Ruixuan Rachel; Wang, Liewei; Zhao, Sihai Dave",,318,20

In the pediatric population, coronavirus disease (COVID)-19 has a reported mortality of less than 6% in complicated cases; however, the clinical characteristics and severity are not the same as those presented in the adult population. This study aimed to describe the clinical manifestations of patients younger than 18 years old and their association with the confirmation of the test and outcomes. Methods: We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study of symptoms suggestive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. All subjects with a confirmatory test for SARS-CoV-2 were included. Initial symptoms, history of influenza vaccination, and previous contact were documented, and mortality and the requirement for assisted mechanical ventilation were identified. The proportions of the variables were compared with the &#967;2 test. The odds ratio for a positive test and the requirement of intubation was calculated. Results: Of a total of 510 subjects, 76 (15%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2. The associated symptoms were chest pain, sudden onset of symptoms, and general malaise. The variable most associated with contagion was the exposure to a relative with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Infants and subjects without the influenza vaccine showed an increased risk for respiratory complications. Conclusions: The frequency of positivity in the test was 15% (infants and adolescents represented 64% of the confirmed cases), and the associated factors identified were contact with a confirmed case, sudden onset of symptoms, and chest pain.","Olivar-López, Víctor; Leyva-Barrera, Ana; López-Martínez, Briceida; Parra-Ortega, Israel; Márquez-González, Horacio",Bol Med Hosp Infant Mex,318,20

However, they are eager to find alternative methods for safely continuing sensory evaluation because it is a critical operation component both in food and non-food industries. As an alternative to indoor sensory booths, this study proposes drive-in booths where panelists evaluate test samples in their own vehicles. This study aimed at determining whether a drive-in booth (DIB) environment could be an effective alternative for a laboratory sensory booth (LSB) environment by comparing the two conditions with respect to sensory and emotional responses, participant engagement in sensory evaluation, and participant feelings of safety from the risk of COVID-19 virus during sensory evaluation. A total of 106 consumers evaluated four beverage samples in terms of sensory, hedonic, and emotional aspects both in traditional sensory booths and in their own vehicles. They rated the levels of engagement in sensory evaluation and feeling of safety during sensory evaluation in both test conditions. Overall, the two test conditions did not differ in terms of sensory, hedonic, and emotional responses to the beverage samples. Differentiation patterns based on sensory and/or emotional responses to the four beverage samples were also similar between the two conditions. While participants in the LSB condition showed more involvement and attention toward sample evaluation using their senses, they rated the DIB condition as being more consistent with real-world experience. They also felt safer during sensory evaluation in the DIB condition than in the LSB condition, leading them to be more engaged in the sensory evaluation. This study concluded that the drive-in booth condition can be a valid substitute when the laboratory sensory booth condition is unavailable because of risks from test environmental factors such as those that may be encountered during pandemic or epidemic periods.","Seo, HanSeok Buffin K.; Asmita, Singh Beekman T.

Objective: To summarize the existing literature on Covid-19 pneumonia imaging including precautionary measures for radiology departments, Chest CT's role in diagnosis and ematic literature search of PubMed/med line electronic databases. Results: The radiologymanagement, imaging findings of COVID-19 patients including children and pregnant women, artificial intelligence applications and practical recommendations. Methods: A syst departments' staff is on the front line of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Strict adherence to precautionary measures is the main defense against infection's spread. Although nucleic acid testing is Covid-19's pneumonia diagnosis gold standard; kits shortage and low sensitivity led to the implementation of the highly sensitive chest computed tomography amidst initial diagnostic tools. Initial Covid-19â¯Câ¯T features comprise bilateral, peripheral or posterior, multilobar ground-glass opacities, predominantly in the lower lobes. Consolidations superimposed on ground-glass opacifications are found in few cases, preponderantly in the elderly. In later disease stages, GGO transformation into multifocal consolidations, thickened interlobular and intralobular lines, crazy paving, traction bronchiectasis, pleural thickening, and subpleural bands are reported. Standardized CT reporting is recommended to guide radiologists. While lung ultrasound, pulmonary MRI, and PET CT are not Covid-19 pneumonia's first-line investigative diagnostic modalities, their characteristic findings and clinical value are outlined. Artificial intelligence's role in strengthening available imaging tools is discussed.

Both pre- and postsynaptic forms of homeostasis are important, but their relative impact on fidelity is unknown. To address this issue, we studied auditory nerve synapses onto bushy cells in the cochlear nucleus of mice of both sexes. These synapses undergo bidirectional pre- and postsynaptic homeostatic changes with increased and decreased acoustic stimulation. We found that both young and mature synapses exhibit similar activity-dependent changes in short-term depression. Experiments using chelators and imaging both indicated that presynaptic Ca2+ influx decreased after noise exposure, and increased after ligating the ear canal. By contrast, Ca2+ cooperativity was unaffected. Experiments using specific antagonists suggest that occlusion leads to changes in the Ca2+ channel subtypes driving neurotransmitter release. Furthermore, dynamic-clamp experiments revealed that spike fidelity primarily depended on changes in presynaptic depression, with some contribution from changes in postsynaptic intrinsic properties. These experiments indicate that presynaptic Ca2+ influx is homeostatically regulated in vivo to enhance synaptic fidelity.Significance StatementHomeostatic mechanisms in synapses maintain stable function in the face of different levels of activity. Both juvenile and mature auditory nerve synapses onto bushy cells modify short-term depression in different acoustic environments, which raises the question of what the underlying presynaptic mechanisms are and the relative importance of pre- and postsynaptic contributions to the faithful transfer of information. Changes in short-term depression under different acoustic conditions were a result of changes in presynaptic Ca2+ influx. Spike fidelity was affected by both presynaptic and postsynaptic changes after ear-occlusion and was only affected by presynaptic changes after noise-rearing. These findings are important for understanding regulation of auditory synapses under normal conditions and also in disorders following noise exposure or conductive hearing loss.","Zhuang, Xiaowen; Wong, Nicole F; Sun, Wei; Xu-Friedman, Matthew A",J. neurosci,318,16

We compare SARS-CoV-2 specific antibody detection rates from four different serological methods, virus neutralisation test (VNT), ID Screen® SARS-CoV-2-N IgG ELISA, Whole Antigen ELISA, and lentivirus-based SARS-CoV-2 pseudotype virus neutralisation tests (pVNT). All methods were able to detect prior infection with COVID-19, albeit with different relative sensitivities. The VNT and SARS-CoV-2-N ELISA methods showed a strong correlation yet provided increased detection rates when used in combination. A pVNT correlated strongly with SARS-CoV-2 VNT and was able to effectively discriminate SARS-CoV-2 antibody positive and negative serum with the same efficiency as the VNT. Moreover, the pVNT was performed with the same level of discrimination across multiple separate institutions. Therefore, the pVNT is a sensitive, specific, and reproducible lower biosafety level alternative to VNT for detecting SARS-CoV-2 antibodies for diagnostic and research applications.

N95 masks are considered one of the essential protective equipment in the management of patients with COVID-19. The shortage of N95 masks implies potential health risks for health personnel and significant economic losses for the health institution. The objective of this work was to investigate the disinfection of N95 masks artificially contaminated with SARS-CoV-2 and ESKAPE bacteria by using hydrogen peroxide plasma. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We examined the disinfection capacity of hydrogen peroxide plasma against the SARS-CoV-2 and 2 members of the ESKAPE bacteria (Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus) through a study of artificial contamination in situ of N95 masks. Amplification of specific genes by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction of SARS-CoV-2 and microbiological culture of ESKAPE bacteria was performed before and after the disinfection process. RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 was not detected in all assays using 5 different concentrations of the virus, and A baumannii and S aureus were not cultivable with inoculums of 102 to 106 CFU after disinfection tests of N95 masks with hydrogen peroxide plasma.

Without any clear indications of abatement, the disease has become a major healthcare threat across the globe, owing to prolonged incubation period, high prevalence, and absence of existing drugs or vaccines. Development of COVID-19 vaccine is being considered as the most efficient strategy to curtail the ongoing pandemic. Following publication of genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2, globally extensive research and development work has been in progress to develop a vaccine against the disease. The use of genetic engineering, recombinant technologies, and other computational tools has led to the expansion of several promising vaccine candidates. The range of technology platforms being evaluated, including virus-like particles, peptides, nucleic acid (DNA and RNA), recombinant proteins, inactivated virus, live attenuated viruses, and viral vectors (replicating and non-replicating) approaches, are striking features of the vaccine development strategies. Viral vectors, the next-generation vaccine platforms, provide a convenient method for delivering vaccine antigens into the host cell to induce antigenic proteins which can be tailored to arouse an assortment of immune responses, as evident from the success of smallpox vaccine and Ervebo vaccine against Ebola virus. As per the World Health Organization, till January 22, 2021, 14 viral vector vaccine candidates are under clinical development including 10 nonreplicating and four replicating types. Moreover, another 39 candidates based on viral vector platform are under preclinical evaluation. This review will outline the current developmental landscape and discuss issues that remain critical to the success or failure of viral vector vaccine candidates against COVID-19.","Bezbaruah, R.; Borah, P.; Kakoti, B.

Some forms of sharing, such as sharecropping or alms-giving, proceed from and sustain asymmetrical relations to the means of life. Access to commons in other social contexts merely serves to make unequal forms of life more bearable. In other words, some expressions of sharing and commons are ""functional"" within hierarchical societies. Departing from these observations, this contribution traces contests over the logic of sharing, and apportioned shares of common land, from Brazil's slave period through contemporary land rights movements in the northeastern state of Bahia. For former slaves and their descendants, ""freedom"" often meant sharecropping on the same plantations from which they had been released. However, rural Brazilians have also succeeded in transforming shared land into more equal and equitable distributions, from ""peasant breaches"" that emerged in slave gardens from the early colonial period through the abolition of slavery, to land occupations that occurred in the late twentieth century. By sharing land and other material resources-especially tree seeds, seedlings, and cuttings-rural laborers have established unexpected reconfigurations in distributions of property and social recognition that exceed institutionalized norms of sharing common land. With such outcomes in view, this contribution distinguishes socially replicative and transformative sharing.","DeVore, Jonathan",Dialect Anthropol,318,24

However, the therapeutic mechanism of the effect of HSBDF on COVID-19 remains unclear. METHODS: The components and action targets of HSBDF were searched in the TCMSP, YaTCM, PubChem, and TargetNet databases. Disease targets related to ACE2 were screened in single-cell sequence data of colon epithelial cells from other reports. The therapeutic targets of HSBDF for COVID-19 were obtained by integrated analysis, and the protein-protein interaction was analyzed using the STRING database. The Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) processes were analyzed using the OmicsBean and Metascape databases. The communication between networks [component-target (C-T) network, component-target-pathway (C-T-P) network, herb-target (H-T) network, target-pathway (T-P) network, and meridian-tropism (M-T) network] was constructed by Cytoscape software. The Cloud computing molecular docking platform was used to verify the molecular docking. RESULTS: The obtained 223 active ingredients and 358 targets of HSBDF. The 5,555 COVID-19 disease targets related to ACE2 were extracted, and 84 compound-disease common targets were found, of which the principal targets included ACE, ESR1, ADRA1A, and HDAC1. A total of 3,946 items were seized by GO enrichment analysis, mainly related to metabolism, protein binding, cellular response to the stimulus, and receptor activity. The enriched KEGG pathways screened 46 signaling pathways, including the renin-angiotensin system, the renin secretion, NF-kappa B pathway, the arachidonic acid metabolism, and the AMPK signaling pathway. The molecular docking results showed that the bioactive components of HSBDF have an excellent binding ability with main proteins related to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). CONCLUSIONS: HSBDF might act on SARS-CoV-2 through multiple components, targets, and pathways. Here we reveal preliminary results of the mechanism of action of HSBDF on SARS-CoV-2, providing a theoretical basis for future clinical applications.","Cai, Yu; Zeng, Min; Chen, Yun-Zhong",Ann Palliat Med,318,1

METHODS: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients and age- and sex-matched healthy controls were studied. Platelet and leukocyte activation, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), a neutrophil-released enzyme, were measured. Four patients were re-studied after recovery. The activating effect of COVID-19 plasma on control platelets and leukocytes and the inhibiting activity of common antithrombotic agents on it were studied. RESULTS: 36 COVID-19 patients and 31 healthy controls were studied; 8/36 COVID-19 patients (22.2%) developed VTE. Platelets and neutrophils were activated in COVID-19 patients. NET, but not platelet activation, biomarkers correlated with disease severity and were associated with thrombosis. Plasmatic MMP-9 was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients.Platelet and neutrophil activation markers, but less so NETs, normalized after recovery.In vitro, plasma from COVID-19 patients triggered platelet and neutrophil activation and NET formation, the latter blocked by therapeutic dose low-molecular weight heparin, but not by aspirin or dypiridamole.

This study examines PCPs' concerns, impact on personal lives and work, and level of pandemic preparedness in the context of COVID-19 in Singapore. We also examine factors and coping strategies that PCPs have used to manage stress during the outbreak. METHODS: Two hundred and sixteen PCPs actively practicing in either a public or private clinic were cluster sampled via email invitation from three primary care organizations in Singapore from 6th to 29th March 2020. Participants completed a cross-sectional online questionnaire consisting of items on work- and non-work-related concerns, impact on personal and work life, perceived pandemic preparedness, stress-reduction factors, and personal coping strategies related to COVID-19. RESULTS: A total of 158 questionnaires were usable for analyses. PCPs perceived themselves to be at high risk of COVID-19 infection (89.9%), and a source of risk (74.7%) and concern (71.5%) to loved ones. PCPs reported acceptance of these risks (91.1%) and the need to care for COVID-19 patients (85.4%). Overall perceived pandemic preparedness was extremely high (75.9 to 89.9%). PCPs prioritized availability of personal protective equipment, strict infection prevention guidelines, accessible information about COVID-19, and well-being of their colleagues and family as the most effective stress management factors. CONCLUSIONS: PCPs continue to serve willingly on the frontlines of this pandemic despite the high perception of risk to themselves and loved ones.

The clinical picture of patients with COVID-19 is characterized by a very large spectrum. The reason for this variability has not been clarified yet, causing the inability to make a prognosis on the evolution of the disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed search was performed focusing on the role of ACE 2 receptors in allowing the viral entry into cells, the role of ACE 2 downregulation in triggering the tissue pathology or in accelerating previous disease states, the role of increased levels of Angiotensin II in determining endothelial dysfunction and the enhanced vascular permeability, the role of the dysregulation of the renin angiotensin system in COVID-19 and the role of cytokine storm. RESULTS: The pathological changes induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection in the different organs, the correlations between the single cell types targeted by the virus in the different human organs and the clinical consequences, COVID-19 chronic pathologies in liver fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis and atrial arrhythmias, glomerulosclerosis and pulmonary fibrosis, due to the systemic fibroblast activation induced by angiotensin II are discussed. CONCLUSIONS: The main pathways involved showed different pathological changes in multiple tissues and the different clinical presentations. Even if ACE2 is the main receptor of SARS-CoV-2 and the main entry point into cells for the virus, ACE2 expression does not always explain the observed marked inter-individual variability in clinical presentation and outcome, evidencing the complexity of this disorder.

Nevertheless, their rapid development did not allow for testing among specific population subgroups such as pregnant and breastfeeding women, or elaborating specific guidelines for healthcare personnel working in high infection risk specialties, such as otolaryngology (ORL). This clinical consensus statement (CCS) aims to offer guidance for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination to this high-risk population based on the best evidence available. METHODS: A multidisciplinary international panel of 33 specialists judged statements through a two-round modified Delphi method survey. Statements were designed to encompass the following topics: risk of SARS-Cov-2 infection and use of protective equipment in ORL; SARS-Cov-2 infection and vaccines and respective risks for the mother/child dyad; and counseling for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in pregnant, breastfeeding, or fertile healthcare workers (PBFHW). All ORL PBFHW were considered as the target audience. RESULTS: Of the 13 statements, 7 reached consensus or strong consensus, 2 reached no consensus, and 2 reached near-consensus. According to the statements with strong consensus otorhinolaryngologists-head and neck surgeons who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or with childbearing potential should have the opportunity to receive SARS-Cov-2 vaccination. Moreover, personal protective equipment (PPE) should still be used even after the vaccination. CONCLUSION: Until prospective evaluations on these topics are available, ORL-HNS must be considered a high infection risk specialty. While the use of PPE remains pivotal, ORL PBFHW should be allowed access to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination provided they receive up-to-date information.","Saibene, Alberto Maria; Allevi, Fabiana; Ayad, Tareck; Baudoin, Tomislav; Bernal-Sprekelsen, Manuel; Briganti, Giovanni; Carrie, Sean; Cayé-Thomasen, Per; Dahman Saidi, Sara; Dauby, Nicolas; Fenton, John; Golusinski, Wojciech; Klimek, Ludger; Leclerc, Andrée-Anne; Longtin, Yves; Mannelli, Giuditta; Mayo-Yáñez, Miguel; Meço, Cem; Metwaly, Osama; Mouawad, François; Niemczyk, Kazimierz; Pedersen, Ulrik; Piersiala, Krzysztof; Plzak, Jan; Remacle, Marc; Rommel, Nathalie; Saleh, Hesham; Szpecht, Dawid; Tedla, Miroslav; Tincati, Camilla; Tucciarone, Manuel; Zelenik, Karol; Lechien, Jerome R",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,318,16

COVID-19 is a disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and leads to respiratory dysfunction. Studies on hemostatic parameters have showed that COVID-19 significantly affects the disruption of the coagulation system and may contribute to coagulation and thrombotic events. A relevant cause of hemostasis disorders is inflammation and cytokine storms, which cause, for example, endothelial dysfunction in blood vessels. In order to prevent and treat states of hypercoagulability and thrombosis, the administration of anticoagulants, e.g., heparin, is recommended. The present mini-review describes the relationship between hemostasis and COVID-19, and discusses whether this relationship may cast light on the nature of COVID-19. The present short manuscript also examines the relationship between blood platelets and COVID-19. In addition, the paper explores the potential use of antiplatelet drugs in COVID-19 cases.

We present 20 hours of audio recordings that we have expertly labelled and tagged precisely in time. Significantly, 18 hours of recordings contain annotations from 36 different species. Mosquitoes are well-known carriers of diseases such as malaria, dengue and yellow fever. Collecting this dataset is motivated by the need to assist applications which utilise mosquito acoustics to conduct surveys to help predict outbreaks and inform intervention policy. The task of detecting mosquitoes from the sound of their wingbeats is challenging due to the difficulty in collecting recordings from realistic scenarios. To address this, as part of the HumBug project, we conducted global experiments to record mosquitoes ranging from those bred in culture cages to mosquitoes captured in the wild. Consequently, the audio recordings vary in signal-to-noise ratio and contain a broad range of indoor and outdoor background environments from Tanzania, Thailand, Kenya, the USA and the UK. In this paper we describe in detail how we collected, labelled and curated the data. The data is provided from a PostgreSQL database, which contains important metadata such as the capture method, age, feeding status and gender of the mosquitoes. Additionally, we provide code to extract features and train Bayesian convolutional neural networks for two key tasks: the identification of mosquitoes from their corresponding background environments, and the classification of detected mosquitoes into species. Our extensive dataset is both challenging to machine learning researchers focusing on acoustic identification, and critical to entomologists, geo-spatial modellers and other domain experts to understand mosquito behaviour, model their distribution, and manage the threat they pose to humans.","Kiskin, Ivan; Sinka, Marianne; Cobb, Adam D.; Rafique, Waqas; Wang, Lawrence; Zilli, Davide; Gutteridge, Benjamin; Dam, Rinita; Marinos, Theodoros; Li, Yunpeng; Msaky, Dickson; Kaindoa, Emmanuel; Killeen, Gerard; Herreros-Moya, Eva; Willis, Kathy J.; Roberts, Stephen J.",,318,1

We longitudinally studied SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in a cohort of asymptomatic (n = 85) and symptomatic (n = 75) COVID-19 patients after seroconversion. We quantified T cells reactive to structural proteins (M, NP, and Spike) using ELISpot and cytokine secretion in whole blood. Frequencies of SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were similar between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, but the former showed an increased IFN-Î³ and IL-2 production. This was associated with a proportional secretion of IL-10 and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-&#945;, and IL-1ß) only in asymptomatic infection, while a disproportionate secretion of inflammatory cytokines was triggered by SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell activation in symptomatic individuals. Thus, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals are not characterized by weak antiviral immunity; on the contrary, they mount a highly functional virus-specific cellular immune response.","Le Bert, Nina; Clapham, Hannah E; Tan, Anthony T; Chia, Wan Ni; Tham, Christine Y L; Lim, Jane M; Kunasegaran, Kamini; Tan, Linda Wei Lin; Dutertre, Charles-Antoine; Shankar, Nivedita; Lim, Joey M E; Sun, Louisa Jin; Zahari, Marina; Tun, Zaw Myo; Kumar, Vishakha; Lim, Beng Lee; Lim, Siew Hoon; Chia, Adeline; Tan, Yee-Joo; Tambyah, Paul Anantharajah; Kalimuddin, Shirin; Lye, David; Low, Jenny G H; Wang, Lin-Fa; Wan, Wei Yee; Hsu, Li Yang; Bertoletti, Antonio; Tam, Clarence C",J. exp. med,318,10

Primer endpoints were efficacy of CZP, defined as statistically significant improvement of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Physician's Global Assessment (PGA), and clinical Disease Activity index for Psoriatic Arthritis (cDAPSA) in the 24 week of therapy. Secondary endpoints were safety of CZP especially during COVID-19 pandemic. Fifty-six moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients treated with CZP were evaluated retrospectively. We observed a rapid and significant reduction of PASI, PGA, and cDAPSA scores in W4. After loading dose, we observed loss of clinical efficacy of CZP in eight patients and optimized therapy by increasing the dosing of CZP. Dose escalation of CZP permitted the achievement and long-term maintenance of clinical improvement in these patients. We compare the clinical efficacy of CZP between naive and patients who has been treated with other biologic agents. There were no statistical differences in efficacy between these two groups. No side effects were observed during CZP treatment. There were no cases of death from COVID-related disease in our study population or patients hospitalized for COVID-19 related disease.

Triage criteria should be objective, ethical, transparent, applied equitably and publically disclosed. The aim of this review is to describe the triage tools and process for critical care resources in a pandemic health emergency. METHODS: A narrative review was conducted of the literature on five electronic databases, namely PubMed, CINHAL, Web of Science, Cochrane and Embase, searching for studies published from 2006 to June 2020. RESULTS: The results describe different triage tools. A gold standard of triage does not exist for the adult or paediatric population. Using probability of short-term survival as the sole allocation principle is problematic. In general, each triage protocol should be applied with a specific ethical justification, including transparency, duty to care, duty to steward resources, duty to plan, and distributive justice. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical triage decisions based on clinical judgment alone are prone to inconsistent application by triage officers in a pandemic. An ethical framework can inform decision-making and improve accountability. It remains difficult to connect clinical criteria and ethical criteria, because of the models on offer for health services.","Iacorossi, Laura; Fauci, Alice J; Napoletano, Antonello; D039,; Angelo, Daniela; Salomone, Katia; Latina, Roberto; Coclite, Daniela; Iannone, Primiano",Acta Biomed,318,13

We successfully isolated a novel respirovirus from the lungs of a dead Malayan pangolin. Similar to murine respirovirus, the full-length genome of this novel virus was 15â384 nucleotides comprising six genes in the order 3'-(leader)-NP-P-M-F-HN-l-(trailer)-5'. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that this virus belongs to the genus Respirovirus and is most closely related to murine respirovirus. Notably, animal infection experiments indicated that the pangolin virus is highly pathogenic and transmissible in mice, with inoculated mice having variable clinical symptoms and a fatality rate of 70.37â%. The virus was found to replicate in most tissues with the exception of muscle and heart. Contact transmission of the virus was 100â% efficient, although the mice in the contact group displayed milder symptoms, with the virus mainly being detected in the trachea and lungs. The isolation of a novel respirovirus from the Malayan pangolin provides new insight into the evolution and distribution of this important group of viruses and again demonstrates the potential infectious disease threats faced by endangered pangolins.","Yang, Rou; Peng, Jinyu; Zhai, Junqiong; Xiao, Kangpeng; Zhang, Xu; Li, Xiaobing; Chen, Xiaoyuan; Chen, Zu-Jin; Holmes, Edward C; Irwin, David M; Shan, Fen; Shen, Xuejuan; Chen, Wu; Shen, Yongyi",J. gen. virol,318,26

This paper employs multivariate diffusion models to investigate and quantitatively assess the competitive power of renewable energy technologies and their perspectives along the invoked energy transition. The study was conducted for the period 1965-2019 on a number of selected case studies, that were considered critically representative of the current transition process in view of their energy and political context. The dynamic relationship between renewable technologies and natural gas has been at the core of the analysis, trying to establish whether gas could be considered as a bridging technology or a lock-in. The main findings show that in all the analyzed countries RETs have exerted a strongly competitive effect towards gas. In most cases, gas is found to have a bridging role, aiding the uptake of renewables.","Bessi, Alessandro; Guidolin, Mariangela; Manfredi, Piero",,318,16

Advanced age and female sex are two of the most prominent risk factors for AD. AD is characterized by progressive neuronal loss, especially in the cortex and hippocampus, and mitochondrial dysfunction has been proposed to be an early event in the onset and progression of the disease. Our results showed early perturbations in mitochondrial function in 3xTg mouse brain, with the cortex being more susceptible to mitochondrial changes than the hippocampus. In the cortex of 3xTg females, decreased coupled and uncoupled respiration were evident early (at 2 months of age), while in males it appeared later at 6 months of age. We observed increased coupled respiration in the hippocampus of 2-month-old 3xTg females, but no changes were detected later in life. Changes in mitochondrial dynamics were indicated by decreased mitofusin (Mfn2) and increased dynamin related protein 1 (Drp1) (only in females) in the hippocampus and cortex of 3xTg mice. Our findings highlight the importance of controlling and accounting for sex, brain region, and age in studies examining brain bioenergetics using this common AD model in order to more accurately evaluate potential therapies and improve the sex-specific translatability of preclinical findings.","Djordjevic, Jelena; Roy Chowdhury, Subir; Snow, Wanda M; Perez, Claudia; Cadonic, Chris; Fernyhough, Paul; Albensi, Benedict C",,318,16

While dentistry is known as one of the most exposed and high-risk professions, dental care professionals are indeed at even greater risk. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess knowledge, attitudes, occupational health practices, personal protective equipment usage, and mental stressors during COVID-19 pandemic among dental care professionals. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among dental care professionals who were subscribers to a dental hygiene journal using a self-administered online survey (nâ=â1047 respondents). Cross-tabulations were performed to determine differences in the responses to the statements related to different domains. RESULTS: COVID-19 impacted the healthy work-life balance (pâ< â0.001) and caused sleeping difficulty among the respondents (pâ< â0.001). Moreover, a lower response on changing respirators and gloves for each patient compared with before viral pandemic was observed (pâ< â0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Ongoing training on infection control, occupational health practices, and PPE usage can prevent the transmission of COVID-19 among dental care professionals and the public. Lack of adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) is a burden for applying occupational health practices in dental clinics and present a risk to the public. COVID-19 may contribute to developing psychological stress and disrupt healthy work-life balance among dental professionals.","Banaee, Sean; Claiborne, Denise M; Akpinar-Elci, Muge",Work,318,33

An unprecedented worldwide effort involving academic institutions, regulatory agencies and industry is facing the challenges imposed by the rapidly spreading disease. Emergency use authorization for vaccines were granted in the beginning of December 2020 in Europe and nine days later in the United States. The urge for vaccination started a race, forcing governs and health care agencies to take decisions on the fly regarding the vaccination strategy and logistics. So far, the vaccination strategies and non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social distancing and the use of face masks, are the only efficient actions to stop the pandemic. In this context, it is of fundamental importance to understand the dynamical behavior of the Covid-19 spread along with possible vaccination strategies. In this work a Susceptible - Infected - Removed - Sick with vaccination (SIRSi-Vaccine) model is proposed. In addtion, the SIRSi-Vaccine model also accounts for unreported, or asymptomatic, cases and the possibility of temporary immunity, either after infection or vaccination. Disease free and endemic equilibrium points existence conditions are determined in the (! ? ?) vaccine-effort and social distancing parameter space. The model is adjusted to the data from S\~ao Paulo, Santos and Campinas, three major cities in the State of S\~ao Paulo, Brazil.","Batistela, Cristiane M.; Correa, Diego P.

During SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic activities performed in Abruzzo region (central Italy) several strains belonging to the B.1.177.75 lineage tested negative for the N gene but positive for the ORF1ab and S genes (+/+/- pattern) by the TaqPath COVID-19 CE-IVD RT-PCR Kit manufactured by Thermofisher. By sequencing, a unique mutation, synonymous 28948C > T, was found in the N-negative B.1.177.75 strains. Although we do not have any knowledge upon the nucleotide sequences of the primers and probe adopted by this kit, it is likely that N gene dropout only occurs when 28948C > T is coupled with 28932C > T, this latter present, in turn, in all B.1.177.75 sequences available on public databases. Furthermore, epidemiological analysis was also performed. The majority of the N-negative B.1.177.75 cases belonged to two clusters apparently unrelated to each other and both clusters involved young people. However, the phylogeny for sequences containing the +/+/- pattern strongly supports a genetic connection and one common source for both clusters. Though, genetic comparison suggests a connection rather than indicating the independent emergence of the same mutation in two apparently unrelated clusters. This study highlights once more the importance of sharing genomic data to link apparently unrelated epidemiological clusters and to, remarkably, update molecular tests.","Amato, Laura; Jurisic, Lucija; Puglia, Ilaria; Di Lollo, Valeria; Curini, Valentina; Torzi, Giuseppe; Di Girolamo, Arturo; Mangone, Iolanda; Mancinelli, Adamo; Decaro, Nicola; Calistri, Paolo; Di Giallonardo, Francesca; Lorusso, Alessio; D039,; Alterio, Nicola",Emerg Microbes Infect,318,24

Linking preprints to publications is of utmost importance as it provides readers with the latest version of a now certified work. Yet leading preprint servers fail to identify all existing preprint-publication links. This limitation calls for a more thorough approach to this critical information retrieval task: overlooking published evidence translates into partial and even inaccurate systematic reviews on health-related issues, for instance. We designed an algorithm leveraging the Crossref public and free source of bibliographic metadata to comb the literature for preprint-publication links. We tested it on a reference preprint set identified and curated for a living systematic review on interventions for preventing and treating COVID-19 performed by international collaboration: the COVID-NMA initiative (covid-nma.com).

A cohort study and longitudinal exploratory analysis were performed. Forty undergraduate first-year dental students, from the University of Coimbra in Portugal, were selected as per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two different teaching methods were applied during an identical time-period: face-to-face lectures complemented by physical models (T1 cohort) and webinar lectures complemented by CBCT images (T2 cohort). Learning outcomes were then studied according to theoretical and spatial orientation contexts. A self-reported survey that focused on students' satisfaction, stress, and support was studied. Both teaching methods were analyzed with paired sample student's t-test and Pearson Correlation Confidence intervals 95% with P < 0.05. Furthermore, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used for self-reported satisfaction survey validity and reliability analysis. The learning outcomes between T1 and T2 cohorts were statistically significant, (P < 0.001) corresponding to differences with a large effect degree (r > 0.60). Students' satisfaction, as measured on a six-point Likert scale, was positively influenced by the webinar lectures supplemented with CBCT images (T2 cohort) in a learning context (4.95 ± 0.5) and future applications (5.92 ± 0.27).

Cardiovascular risk factors and chronic cardiovascular conditions are prevalent among patients affected by COVID-19 and associated with adverse outcomes. However, whether pre-existing cardiovascular disease is an independent determinant of higher mortality risk with COVID-19 remains uncertain. Acute cardiac injury, manifest by increased blood levels of cardiac troponin, electrocardiographic abnormalities, or myocardial dysfunction, occurs in up to ~60% of hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. Potential contributors to acute cardiac injury in the setting of COVID-19 include (1) acute changes in myocardial demand and supply due to tachycardia, hypotension, and hypoxemia resulting in type 2 myocardial infarction; (2) acute coronary syndrome due to acute atherothrombosis in a virally induced thrombotic and inflammatory milieu; (3) microvascular dysfunction due to diffuse microthrombi or vascular injury; (4) stress-related cardiomyopathy (Takotsubo syndrome); (5) nonischemic myocardial injury due to a hyperinflammatory cytokine storm; or (6) direct viral cardiomyocyte toxicity and myocarditis. Diffuse thrombosis is emerging as an important contributor to adverse outcomes in patients with COVID-19. Practitioners should be vigilant for cardiovascular complications of COVID-19. Monitoring may include serial cardiac troponin and natriuretic peptides, along with fibrinogen, D-dimer, and inflammatory biomarkers. Management decisions should rely on the clinical assessment for the probability of ongoing myocardial ischemia, as well as alternative nonischemic causes of injury, integrating the level of suspicion for COVID-19.","Lang, Joshua P; Wang, Xiaowen; Moura, Filipe A; Siddiqi, Hasan K; Morrow, David A; Bohula, Erin A",Am Heart J,318,20

This work provides a one-step green synthetic approach to prepare iodine fibrous adsorbents without any chemical initiators or large amount of organic solvent. The original and modified PE/PP fibers were characterized by fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), thermogravimetric (TG) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to demonstrate the grafting of NVP onto the PE/PP fibers. The capacity of iodine absorbed by the PE/PP-g-PNVP fibers was 1237.8 mg/g after 180 min. Meanwhile, absorbents can be regenerated efficiently by two different means of ethanol elution and heating at 120 °C, respectively. Within 10 min, 94.17% and 90.12% of the iodine can be released from the PE/PP-g-PNVP fibers with these two methods, respectively.

Therefore, the purpose of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the existing evidence on the susceptibility of the ABO blood group to COVID-19 infection. METHODS: Systematically searched published articles in PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and EMBASE between 1 st January 2020 and 21 st March 2021. After quality control and the exclusion of irrelevant studies, 16 studies were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: Although the random-effect meta-analysis revealed a large heterogeneity among studies, I 2 = 99.197 %. The pooled event rates and (95 % CIs) for A, O, B, and AB blood group were 0.459 (95 %CI: 0.358-0.441), 0.342 (95 %CI: 0.298-0.374), 0.180 (95 %CI: 0.150-0.214), and 0.076 (95 %CI: 0.055-0.127), respectively. These results indicated that the COVID-19 infection rate was higher in persons with blood group A > O > B > AB. Overall, the ABO blood group's vulnerability to COVID-19 infection was statistically significant (pooled p -value<0.001). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis offers a further indication of blood group A individuals' vulnerability to COVID-19 infection, and blood type AB are linked to a lower risk of COVID-19 infection.","Kabrah, Saeed M; Kabrah, Ahmed M; Flemban, Arwa F; Abuzerr, Samer",Transfus Apher Sci,318,24

However, in such emergencies, the preservation of public health, by firstly reducing human loss of life may be prioritized and then restrictive measures are implemented. The trade-off between damage due to the threat and the decrease in damage due to the lockdown is largely unexplored. Here we show that there is a degree of compensation between damage from epidemic deaths and from traffic deaths, especially in the case of immediate restrictive measures imposed by governments. Based on the Italian case, we found that damage from loss of human Capital and health care costs could have been fully compensated if the lockdown had been imposed ten days earlier. Considering only one Italian region (Puglia), where the epidemic was delayed and then restrictions were timely, damage due to loss of human Capital was largely compensated in the real scenario. However, damage due to loss of welfare could not have been fully compensated for, since Covid-19 deaths largely outnumber traffic deaths in the simulated epidemic period and loss of welfare damage is scarcely dependent on the age-at-death. From a broader perspective, societies seem to react to external threats as a whole organism, thus tending to restore the original equilibrium. Governmental decisions could accelerate this process. However, in the case of similar threats, some wounds cannot be compensated for, such as the incalculable damage due to loss of welfare.","Colonna, Pasquale; Intini, Paolo",Transp. Res. Interdiscip.

Historically low interest rates can tempt governments to expand public debt to excessive levels, since the immediate budgetary consequences are small. But once interest rates rise again, governments may be forced to either conduct painful debt consolidation, default on at least part of their debt, or allow high inflation, at the potential cost of hyperinflation. Because financial market participants may doubt policy makers‘ commitment to servicing the public debt, a high level of debt carries the risk of self-fulfilling debt crises. We stress that new debt should always be associated with growth-enhancing policies that expand the government’s resources, thus reducing the need for painful consolidation and distributional conflict later on.","Krause, Michael Lubik Thomas A.",Zeitschrift für Wirtschaftspolitik,318,26

However, it needs an adequate learning curve, and it may be challenging in non-expert hands. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of Transcollation Technology over Traditional Electrocautery to perform hilar and mediastinal dissection during VATS lobectomy. METHODS: This is a single-center retrospective study including consecutive patients undergoing VATS lobectomy for lung cancer. Patients were divided in two groups based on whether Transcollation Technology (TT Group) or Traditional Electrocautery (TE Group) was used for hilar and mediastinal lymphadenectomy. Operative time and surgical outcome, including number of transfusions, length of chest drainage, length of hospital stay, morbidity and mortality were registered, and the inter-group differences were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: 53 patients were included in the final analysis. The TT Group (n = 24) compared to the TE Group (n = 29) showed significant shorter operative time (75.2 ± 25.8 min versus 98.1 ± 33.3 min; p = 0.023), and reduction of length of chest tube stay (4.7 ± 0.8 days vs. 6.8 ± 1.1 days, p = 0.013) and length of hospital stay (5.3 ± 1.9 days vs. 6.8 ± 1.1 days, p = 0.007). No intraoperative or major postoperative complications were observed in either groups. CONCLUSIONS: Transcollation Technology represents a valid alternative to standard electrocautery instruments during VATS lobectomy.

METHODS: We probed potential interactions between these pathogens among adults aged &#8805;65y by measuring associations of COVID-19 outcomes with pneumococcal vaccination (13-valent conjugate and 23-valent polysaccharide; PCV13, PPSV23). We estimated adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) using Cox proportional hazards models with doubly-robust inverse-propensity weighting. We assessed effect modification by antibiotic exposure to further test the biologic plausibility of a causal role for pneumococci. RESULTS: Among 531,033 adults, there were 3,677 COVID-19 diagnoses, leading to 1,075 hospitalizations and 334 fatalities, between 1 March-22 July, 2020. Estimated aHRs for COVID-19 diagnosis, hospitalization, and mortality associated with prior PCV13 receipt were 0.65 (95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.72), 0.68 (0.57-0.83), and 0.68 (0.49-0.95), respectively. Prior PPSV23 receipt was not associated with protection against the three outcomes. COVID-19 diagnosis was not associated with prior PCV13 within 90 days following antibiotic receipt, whereas aHR estimates were 0.65 (0.50-0.84) and 0.62 (0.56-0.70) during risk periods 91-365d and >365d following antibiotic receipt, respectively. DISCUSSION: Reduced risk of COVID-19 among PCV13 recipients, transiently attenuated by antibiotic exposure, suggests pneumococci may interact with SARS-CoV-2.","Lewnard, Joseph A; Bruxvoort, Katia J; Fischer, Heidi; Hong, Vennis X; Grant, Lindsay R; Jódar, Luis; Gessner, Bradford D; Tartof, Sara Y",J. infect. dis,318,18

He also reported worsening general malaise, headaches and fever despite recently completed antibiotic treatment with azithromycin for community acquired pneumonia. Physical examination was remarkable for tachycardia, tachypnea and bilateral respiratory crackles. Laboratory results were concerning for severe hypoxemia and lymphopenia. Bilateral pneumonic infiltrates were identified on imaging. The patient presented rapid clinical deterioration with signs of acute respiratory failure for which rapid sequence intubation protocol was followed. Inflammatory markers including ferritin levels were elevated raising suspicion for severe SARS-CoV-2, which was confirm by positive COVID-19 PCR test. After initial 48 hours with hydroxychloroquine, no clinical improvement was recorded. In view of continued clinical deterioration, the patient was enrolled in a convalescent plasma clinical trial with successful negative PCR test result after 48 hours of infusion. Results also correlated with slight clinical improvement including mechanical ventilation parameters, yet multiple attempts to wean off mechanical support were unsuccessful. Hospitalization was complicated with spontaneous bilateral pneumothorax. Multiple chest tubes were placed with minimal improvement of pneumothorax size. Exploratory bronchoscopy was performed and multiple bilateral sites of air-leak were encountered, explaining the non-resolving pneumothorax. The patient underwent exploratory thoracotomy, during which right lung fistula was corrected. Left lung pleurodesis with doxycycline was performed but unfortunately, pneumothorax persisted. Patient continued on ventilatory support for 5 months and remained with poor prognosis when this article was written. This case exposes the difficulty and complexity of caring for severe SARS-CoV-2 patients.

As a novel disease, there aren't general practice guidelines to direct medical management. We describe this case in order to provide a point of reference for medical care workers treating similar patients. Many questions regarding SARS-CoV-2 infection are still unanswer, in particularly if early establishment of aggressive management would decrease incidence of this type of catastrophic lung complication.","Garcia Puebla, J.

It manifests with several symptoms, on a spectrum from asymptomatic to severe illness and death. Many typical imaging features of this disease are described, such as bilateral multi-lobar ground-glass opacities (GGO) or consolidations with a predominantly peripheral distribution. COVID-19-associated bronchiectasis is an atypical finding, and it is not a commonly described sequel of the disease. Here, we present a previously healthy middle-aged man who developed progressive bronchiectasis evident on serial chest CT scans with superimposed bacterial infection following COVID-19 pneumonia. The patient's complicated hospital course of superimposed bacterial infection in the setting of presumed bronchiectasis secondary to COVID-19 is alleged to have contributed to his prolonged hospital stay, with difficulty in weaning off mechanical ventilation. Clinicians should have high suspicion and awareness of such a debilitating complication, as further follow-up and management might be warranted.","Suliman, A. M.; Bitar, B. W.; Farooqi, A.

But how populations did react to these measures? We examined the case of France. Our aims were threefold: assessing some aspects of their impact on French's daily living conditions; investigating their attitudes toward the lockdown; investigating the factors associated with these attitudes. METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey was carried out 10 days after the nationwide lockdown (from March 27th to March 29th 2020), among a representative sample of the mainland French population aged 18 and over. A quota sampling method was applied to achieve a sample of 1012 respondents. We used a cluster analysis to obtain contrasted attitudinal profiles, and logistic regressions to investigated which factors were associated to these profiles. RESULTS: After 10 days of lockdown, there were already significant consequences regarding respondents' living conditions and mental health. Most respondents supported the current lockdown. However, it appeared as a stopgap measure due to a lack of alternatives, and a large majority acknowledged its heavy drawbacks. We found three contrasted attitudinal profiles: full support (38%), strong but critical support (31%), limited support (31%). Regarding respondents' SES, low-income and low-education respondents were more likely to display critical or limited support to the lockdown, as well as those who reported deteriorated living conditions or psychological distress. CONCLUSIONS: In France, the large public support to the lockdown was fragile. First, it was a critical consensus anchored in current controversies and recent social struggles. Second, it was weaker among people with a lows SES, especially since the lockdown have exacerbated preexisting social inequalities.","Peretti-Watel, Patrick; Verger, Pierre; Launay, Odile",BMC Public Health,318,1

Since the start of the pandemic in early 2020, there has been considerable emphasis placed on the implications for patients with cancer in terms of their vulnerability to the virus and potential exposure in healthcare settings. But little emphasis has been placed on the significant, and potentially enduring, consequences of COVID-19 for how cancer care is delivered. In this article, we outline the importance of a focus on the effects of COVID-19 for oncology practice during and potentially after the pandemic, focusing on key shifts that are already evident, including: the pivot to online consultations, shifts in access to clinical trial and definitions of ""essential care,"" the changing economics of practice, and the potential legacy effects of rapidly implemented changes in cancer care. COVID-19 is reshaping oncology practice, clinical trials, and delivery of cancer care broadly, and these changes might endure well beyond the short- to mid-term of the active pandemic. Therefore, shifts in practice brought about by the pandemic must be accompanied by improved training and awareness, enhanced infrastructure, and evidence-based support if they are to harness the positives and offset the potential negative consequences of the impacts of COVID-19 on cancer care.","Broom, Alex; Kenny, Katherine; Page, Alexander; Cort, Nicole; Lipp, Eric S; Tan, Aaron C; Ashley, David M; Walsh, Kyle M; Khasraw, Mustafa",Clin Cancer Res,318,21

The systemic inflammatory response is a pathogenic mechanism shared by cancer progression and COVID-19. We investigated systemic inflammation as a driver of severity and mortality from COVID-19, evaluating the prognostic role of commonly used inflammatory indices in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cancer accrued to the OnCovid study. METHODS: In a multicenter cohort of SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cancer in Europe, we evaluated dynamic changes in neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (NLR); platelet:lymphocyte ratio (PLR); Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), renamed the OnCovid Inflammatory Score (OIS); modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (mGPS); and Prognostic Index (PI) in relation to oncological and COVID-19 infection features, testing their prognostic potential in independent training (n=529) and validation (n=542) sets. RESULTS: We evaluated 1071 eligible patients, of which 625 (58.3%) were men, and 420 were patients with malignancy in advanced stage (39.2%), most commonly genitourinary (n=216, 20.2%). 844 (78.8%) had &#8805;1 comorbidity and 754 (70.4%) had &#8805;1 COVID-19 complication. NLR, OIS, and mGPS worsened at COVID-19 diagnosis compared with pre-COVID-19 measurement (p<0.01), recovering in survivors to pre-COVID-19 levels. Patients in poorer risk categories for each index except the PLR exhibited higher mortality rates (p<0.001) and shorter median overall survival in the training and validation sets (p<0.01). Multivariable analyses revealed the OIS to be most independently predictive of survival (validation set HR 2.48, 95% CI 1.47 to 4.20, p=0.001; adjusted concordance index score 0.611). CONCLUSIONS: Systemic inflammation is a validated prognostic domain in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with cancer and can be used as a bedside predictor of adverse outcome. Lymphocytopenia and hypoalbuminemia as computed by the OIS are independently predictive of severe COVID-19, supporting their use for risk stratification. Reversal of the COVID-19-induced proinflammatory state is a putative therapeutic strategy in patients with cancer.","Dettorre, Gino M; Dolly, Saoirse; Loizidou, Angela; Chester, John; Jackson, Amanda; Mukherjee, Uma; Zambelli, Alberto; Aguilar-Company, Juan; Bower, Mark; Sng, Christopher C T; Salazar, Ramon; Bertuzzi, Alexia; Brunet, Joan; Mesia, Ricard; Sita-Lumsden, Ailsa; Seguí, Elia; Biello, Federica; Generali, Daniele; Grisanti, Salvatore; Seeva, Pavetha; Rizzo, Gianpiero; Libertini, Michela; Maconi, Antonio; Moss, Charlotte; Russell, Beth; Harbeck, Nadia; Vincenzi, Bruno; Bertulli, Rossella; Ottaviani, Diego; Liñan, Raquel; Marrari, Andrea; Carmona-García, M Carmen; Chopra, Neha; Tondini, Carlo Alberto; Mirallas, Oriol; Tovazzi, Valeria; Fotia, Vittoria; Cruz, Claudia Andrea; Saoudi-Gonzalez, Nadia; Felip, Eudald; Roqué, Ariadna; Lee, Alvin J X; Newsom-Davis, Tom; García-Illescas, David; Reyes, Roxana; Wong, Yien Ning Sophia; Ferrante, Daniela; Scotti, Lorenza; Marco-Hernández, Javier; Ruiz-Camps, Isabel",J. immunotherap. cancer,318,16

This study reviews knowledge on the impact of COVID-19 on pregnancy and describes the outcome of published cases of pregnant women diagnosed with COVID-19. Methods: Searches were conducted in PubMed®, Scopus®, Web of Science®, and MedRxiv® up to 26th June 2020, using PRISMA standards, to identify original published studies describing pregnant women at any gestational age diagnosed COVID-19. There were no date or language restrictions on the search. All identified studies were included irrespective of assumptions on study quality. Results: We identified 161 original studies reporting 3,985 cases of pregnant women with COVID-19 (1,007 discharged while pregnant). The 2,059 published cases with pregnancy outcomes resulted in 42 abortions, 21 stillbirths, and 2,015 live births. Preterm birth occurred in 23% of cases. Around 6% of pregnant women required admission to an intensive care unit and 28 died. There were 10 neonatal deaths. From the 163 cases with amniotic fluid, placenta, and/or cord blood analyzed for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, 10 were positive. Sixty-one newborns were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Four breast milk samples from 92 cases showed evidence of SARS-CoV-2. Conclusion: Emerging evidence suggests that vertical transmission is possible, however, there is still a limited number of reported cases with intrapartum samples. Information, counseling and adequate monitoring are essential to prevent and manage adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy.","Rodrigues, Carina; Baía, Inês; Domingues, Rosa; Barros, Henrique",Front Public Health,318,1

This systematic review and meta-analysis was initiated to clarify the prevalence of respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis in the pre-COVID-19 pandemic era. METHODS: We performed an electronic search through Pubmed and Global Index Medicus databases. We included observational studies reporting the detection rate of common respiratory viruses in children with bronchiolitis using molecular assays. Data was extracted and the quality of the included articles was assessed. We conducted sensitivity, subgroups, publication bias, and heterogeneity analyses using a random effect model. RESULTS: The final meta-analysis included 51 studies. Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) was largely the most commonly detected virus 59.2%; 95% CI [54.7; 63.6]). The second predominant virus was Rhinovirus (RV) 19.3%; 95% CI [16.7; 22.0]) followed by Human bocavirus (HBoV) 8.2%; 95% CI [5.7; 11.2]). Other reported viruses included Human Adenovirus (HAdV) 6.1%; 95% CI [4.4; 8.0]), Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) 5.4%; 95% CI [4.4; 6.4]), Human Parainfluenzavirus (HPIV) 5.4%; 95% CI [3.8; 7.3]), Influenza 3.2%; 95% CI [2.2; 4.3], Human Coronavirus (HCoV) 2.9%; 95% CI [2.0; 4.0]), and Enterovirus (EV) 2.9%; 95% CI [1.6; 4.5]). HRSV was the predominant virus involved in multiple detection and most codetections were HRSV + RV 7.1%, 95% CI [4.6; 9.9]) and HRSV + HBoV 4.5%, 95% CI [2.4; 7.3]). CONCLUSIONS: The present study has shown that HRSV is the main cause of bronchiolitis in children, we also have Rhinovirus, and Bocavirus which also play a significant role.

Carriers as well as transport users have faced great challenges of maintaining traffic. Measures and requirements imposed on them were often obscure, imprecise, and the journey itself was uncertain. Passengers were in fear of whether they would be able to reach their destination, but also whether they will succeed in preserving their health. Carriers, on the other hand, have also sought to adapt and provide passengers with safe transport. Nevertheless, the pandemic caused financial collapse of many carriers, landed the world fleet and closed many airports. Various legal instruments related to the protection of public health are applied in air transport, and they have been adopted within the framework of the World Health Organisation (WHO), the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which will be presented in the paper. Various epidemiological measures related to the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic have been prescribed in air transport, applicable during the journey, which have certain specifics in relation to other modes of transport. The paper will present epidemiological measures as well as the procedure applied when there is a passenger on the flight who shows symptoms of an infectious disease, and new procedures related to transport of goods. It will also address the obligation to complete certain forms and provide various information as well as the obligation to compensate costs for cancelled flights. There is no doubt that the COVID-19 pandemic has a significant economic impact on air transport, and efforts will be made to present measures and provide forecasts for the recovery of air traffic in the period that follows. The paper will also address the question as to whether existing legislation and measures are appropriate, whether relevant international organisations have taken prompt measures to protect and ensure air transport during the pandemic, and whether sufficient measures have been taken to protect the health of passengers on the flight.","Vasilj, A.; Erceg, B.

METHODS: Structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography with [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) were prospectively acquired simultaneously on a hybrid PET-MR in 12 patients (2 males, 10 females, mean age: 42.6 years, age range: 23-60 years) with sudden dysosmia and positive detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on nasopharyngeal swab specimens. FDG-PET data were analyzed using a voxel-based approach and compared with that of a group of healthy subjects. RESULTS: Bilateral blocking of the olfactory cleft was observed in six patients, while subtle olfactory bulb asymmetry was found in three patients. No MRI signal abnormality downstream of the olfactory tract was observed. Decrease or increase in glucose metabolism abnormalities was observed (p < .001 uncorrected, k &#8805; 50 voxels) in core olfactory and high-order neocortical areas. A modulation of regional cerebral glucose metabolism by the severity and the duration of COVID-19-related dysosmia was disclosed using correlation analyses. CONCLUSIONS: This PET-MR study suggests that sudden loss of smell in COVID-19 is not related to central involvement due to SARS-CoV-2 neuroinvasiveness. Loss of smell is associated with subtle cerebral metabolic changes in core olfactory and high-order cortical areas likely related to combined processes of deafferentation and active functional reorganization secondary to the lack of olfactory stimulation.","Niesen, Maxime; Trotta, Nicola; Noel, Antoine; Coolen, Tim; Fayad, Georges; Leurkin-Sterk, Gil; Delpierre, Isabelle; Henrard, Sophie; Sadeghi, Niloufar; Goffard, Jean-Christophe; Goldman, Serge; De Tiège, Xavier",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,318,1

The number of newly registered rheumatologists has stagnated. Primary care, which takes up a key role in early detection of rheumatic disease, is working at full capacity. COVID-19 and its containment impede rheumatological treatment. Telemedicine in rheumatology (telerheumatology) could support rheumatologists and general practitioners. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to investigate acceptance and preferences related to the use of telerheumatology care among German rheumatologists and general practitioners. METHODS: A nationwide, cross-sectional, self-completed, paper-based survey on telerheumatology care was conducted among outpatient rheumatologists and general practitioners during the pre-COVID-19 period. RESULTS: A total of 73.3% (349/476) of survey participants rated their knowledge of telemedicine as unsatisfactory, poor, or very poor. The majority of survey participants (358/480, 74.6%) answered that they do not currently use telemedicine, although 62.3% (291/467) would like to. Barriers to the implementation of telemedicine include the purchase of technology equipment (182/292, 62.3%), administration (181/292, 62.0%), and poor reimbursement (156/292, 53.4%). A total of 69.6% (117/168) of the surveyed physicians reckoned that telemedicine could be used in rheumatology. Surveyed physicians would prefer to use telemedicine to communicate directly with other physicians (370/455, 81.3%) than to communicate with patients (213/455, 46.8%). Among treatment phases, 64.4% (291/452) of participants would choose to use telemedicine during follow-up. Half of the participants would choose telecounseling as a specific approach to improve rheumatology care (91/170, 53.5%). CONCLUSIONS: Before COVID-19 appeared, our results indicated generally low use but high acceptance of the implementation of telerheumatology among physicians. Participants indicated that the lack of a structural framework was a barrier to the effective implementation of telerheumatology. Training courses should be introduced to address the limited knowledge on the part of physicians in the use of telemedicine. More research into telerheumatology is required. This includes large-scale randomized controlled trials, economic analyses, and the exploration of user preferences.","Muehlensiepen, Felix; Knitza, Johannes; Marquardt, Wenke; Engler, Jennifer; Hueber, Axel; Welcker, Martin",J Med Internet Res,318,26

Yet, just as problematic can be instances where the advice is welcome and so left unchallenged. Two such cases in which the UK government followed flawed expert advice are considered: intelligence assessments and military advice leading up to the 2003 Iraq War and the role of SAGE (the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) during the first stages of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. Governments need to interrogate advice and make sure that they understand its underlying assumptions and implications.

First, we propose a quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) estimator of the change point based on the second moments of factors, which are estimated by principal component analysis. We show that the QML estimator performs consistently when the covariance matrix of the pre- or post-break factor loading, or both, is singular. When the loading matrix undergoes a rotational type of change while the number of factors remains constant over time, the QML estimator incurs a stochastically bounded estimation error. In this case, we establish an asymptotic distribution of the QML estimator. The simulation results validate the feasibility of this estimator when used in finite samples. In addition, we demonstrate empirical applications of the proposed method by applying it to estimate the break points in a U.S. macroeconomic dataset and a stock return dataset.","Duan, Jiangtao; Bai, Jushan; Han, Xu",,318,14

From Luis Sepulveda to Madam Mim,21.37394,4.5636353,2020,"One of the immediate responses to COVID-19 has been a call to ban wildlife trade given the suspected origin of the pandemic in a Chinese market selling and butchering wild animals. There is clearly an urgent need to tackle wildlife trade that is illegal, unsustainable or carries major risks to human health, biodiversity conservation or meeting acceptable animal welfare standards. However, some of the suggested actions in these calls go far beyond tackling these risks and have the potential to undermine human rights, damage conservation incentives and harm sustainable development. There are a number of reasons for this concerns. First calls for bans on wildlife markets often include calls for bans on wet markets, but the two are not the same thing, and wet markets can be a critical underpinning of informal food systems. Second, wildlife trade generates essential resources for the world's most vulnerable people, contributing to food security for millions of people, particularly in developing countries. Third, wildlife trade bans have conservation risks including driving trade underground, making it even harder to regulate, and encouraging further livestock production. Fourth, in many cases, sustainable wildlife trade can provide key incentives for local people to actively protect species and the habitat they depend on, leading to population recoveries. Most importantly, a singular focus on wildlife trade overlooks the key driver of the emergence of infectious diseases: habitat destruction, largely driven by agricultural expansion and deforestation, and industrial livestock production. We suggest that the COVID-19 crisis provides a unique opportunity for a paradigm shift both in our global food system and also in our approach to conservation. We make specific suggestions as to what this entails, but the overriding principle is that local people must be at the heart of such policy shifts.","Roe, Dilys; Dickman, Amy; Kock, Richard; Milner-Gulland, E J; Rihoy, Elizabeth; 039,; t Sas-Rolfes, Michael",World Dev,318,21

DESIGN: Retrospective. SETTING: An Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admitting mechanically ventilated patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. PATIENTS: Four adult patients. INTERVENTIONS: We compared the blood values of IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP) and of other biochemical variables including the PaO2/FiO2 in two patients who received TCZ alone and in other 2 in whom it was associated with the HA (TCZ-HA) due to the presence of impending or established organ failures other than the lung. All variables were measured before, during and after the treatment. MAIN RESULTS: In all patients, the IL-6 increased during the treatment; after its termination, its values sharply decreased only in those treated also with HA; conversely, the CRP decreased in all patients; the PaO2/FiO2 increased in three patients and remained stable in the remaining one. Both the TCZ and the HA were well tolerated; all patients were weaned from the mechanical ventilation and discharged from the hospital. LIMITATIONS: Although the limited number of patients does not allow to draw firm conclusions, the increase of the IL-6 of can be ascribed to its displacement from cellular and soluble receptors, whereas its decrease is likely due to the scavenging effect exerted by the HA. Although the association TCZ-HA could be valuable in the treatment of the Cytokine Release Storm (CRS) associated with the SARS-CoV-2, the HA could be more effective as it neutralizes a wider panel of inflammatory mediators.","Berlot, Giorgio; Pintacuda, Stefania; Moro, Edoardo; Paluzzano, Giacomo; Scamperle, Alice; Chillemi, Antonino; Longo, Irene; Dattola, Roberto; Roman-Pognuz, Erik; Tomasini, Ariella",Int J Artif Organs,318,16

We evaluate the effect of COVID-19 epidemic to acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients with large vessel occlusion (LVO) received endovascular treatment (EVT) in our institution. METHODS: AIS patients with LVO who underwent EVT in the period of January 1st to April 30th between 2015 and 2020 from our stroke center. The baseline characteristics, working flow time, safety and efficacy outcome and the hospitalization status were retrospectively reviewed, compared and analyzed. RESULTS: There is significant decline in the number of AIS patients with LVO treated compared with the previous year (36 Vs 72 patients) during the epidemic period. The door to puncture time was significantly prolong (225 minutes versus 115 minutes) as well as the length of hospital stay with increase of the hospitalization costs (P < 0.05 for all). There is no significant difference on the safety and efficacy outcome, such recanalization rate, incidence of intracranial hemorrhage, functional independence and mortality during the epidemic (P > 0.05 for all).

The mechanisms underlying this prothrombotic state remain enigmatic. Further data to guide anticoagulation strategies are urgently required. METHODS: We used viscoelastic rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) in a single-center cohort of 40 critically ill COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Clear signs of a hypercoagulable state due to severe hypofibrinolysis were found. Maximum lysis, especially following stimulation of the extrinsic coagulation system, was inversely associated with an enhanced risk of thromboembolic complications. Combining values for maximum lysis with D-dimer concentrations revealed high sensitivity and specificity of thromboembolic risk prediction. CONCLUSIONS: The study identifies a reduction in fibrinolysis as an important mechanism in COVID-19-associated coagulopathy. The combination of ROTEM and D-dimer concentrations may prove valuable in identifying patients requiring higher intensity anticoagulation.","Kruse, Jan Matthias; Magomedov, Abakar; Kurreck, Annika; Münch, Frédéric H; Koerner, Roland; Kamhieh-Milz, Julian; Kahl, Andreas; Gotthardt, Inka; Piper, Sophie K; Eckardt, Kai-Uwe; Dörner, Thomas; Zickler, Daniel",Crit Care,318,16

However, in recent surveys, acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine has been low. To design more effective outreach interventions, there is an urgent need to understand public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to analyze the potential of leveraging transfer learning to detect tweets containing opinions, attitudes, and behavioral intentions toward COVID-19 vaccines, and to explore temporal trends as well as automatically extract topics across a large number of tweets. METHODS: We developed machine learning and transfer learning models to classify tweets, followed by temporal analysis and topic modeling on a dataset of COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets posted from November 01, 2020 to January 31, 2021. We used the F1 values as the primary outcome to compare the performance of machine learning and transfer learning models. The statistical values and p-values from the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test were used to assess whether users' perceptions changed over time. The main topics in tweets were extracted by latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) analysis. RESULTS: We collected 2,678,372 tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines with 841,978 unique users and annotated 5,000 tweets. The F1 values of transfer learning models were 0.792 [0.789, 0.795], 0.578 [0.572, 0.0.584], and 0.614 [0.606, 0.622] for these three tasks, which significantly outperformed the machine learning models (logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine). The prevalence of tweets containing attitudes and behavioral intentions varied significantly over time. Specifically, tweets containing positive behavioral intentions increased significantly in December 2020. In addition, we selected tweets in the following categories: positive attitudes, negative attitudes, positive behavioral intentions, and negative behavioral intentions. Then we identified 10 main topics and relevant terms for each category. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we provided a method to automatically analyze the public understanding of COVID-19 vaccines from real-time data in social media, which can be used to tailor educational programs and other interventions to effectively promote the public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines.","Liu, Siru; Li, Jili; Liu, Jialin",J. med. internet res,318,12

The information included in this paper provides a strong intellectual groundwork for the ongoing development of therapeutic agents and vaccines along with a deeper discussion of intellectual property rights under epidemic conditions. The results show that there has been a rapid increase in human coronavirus patents, especially COVID-19 patents. China and the United States play an outstanding role in global cooperation and patent application. The leading role of academic institutions and government is increasingly apparent. Notable technological issues related to human coronaviruses include pharmacochemical treatment, diagnosis of viral infection, viral-vector vaccines, and traditional Chinese medicine.

Median dosage of HCQ was 400 mg daily, and median (25th-75th percentile) duration of HCQ therapy was 1006 (471-2075) days. Mean on-treatment QTc was 430.9 ± 31.8 ms. In total, 55 patients (7%) had QTc 470-500 ms, and 12 (1.5%) had QTc >500 ms. Chronic kidney disease (CKD), history of atrial fibrillation (AF), and heart failure were independent risk factors for prolonged QTc. In a subset of 591 patients who also had a pretreatment electrocardiogram, mean QTc increased from 424.4 ± 29.7 ms to 432.0 ± 32.3 ms (P <.0001) during HCQ treatment. Of these patients, 23 (3.9%) had either prolongation of QTc >15% or on-treatment QTc >500 ms. Over median 5.97 (3.33-10.11) years of follow-up, 269 patients (33%) died. QTc >470 ms during HCQ treatment was associated with a greater mortality risk (hazard ratio 1.78; 95% confidence interval 1.16-2.71; P = .008) in univariable but not in multivariable analysis. CONCLUSION: HCQ is associated with QT prolongation in a significant fraction of patients. The risk of QT prolongation is higher among patients with CKD, AF, and heart failure, who may benefit from greater scrutiny.","Hooks, Matthew; Bart, Bradley; Vardeny, Orly; Westanmo, Anders; Adabag, Selçuk",Heart Rhythm,318,1

The aim of these systems is the description, analysis, and evaluation of the epidemiology of acute respiratory infections (ARIs), the identification of the circulating viruses, and the trend. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the systems have been expanded to enable monitoring of infections with SARS-CoV­2.Three systems are presented: GrippeWeb, the primary care sentinel Arbeitsgemeinschaft Influenza with its electronic reporting module SEEDARE, and the ICD-10-based hospital sentinel ICOSARI. With these systems, ARIs can be monitored at the population, outpatient, and inpatient levels. In combination with the monitoring of mortality, these systems provide important information on the frequency of different stages of disease severity in the population. In order to expand the systems to SARS-CoV­2, only a few adjustments were needed.As the case definitions for ARIs were preserved, historical baselines of the systems can still be used for comparison. All systems are structured in such a way that stable and established reference values are available for calculating weekly proportions and rates.This is an important addition to the mandatory reporting system of infectious diseases in Germany, which depends on the particular testing strategy, the number of tests performed, and on specific case definitions, which are adapted as required.The surveillance systems have proven to be feasible and efficient in the COVID-19 pandemic, even when compared internationally.","Goerlitz, Luise; Tolksdorf, Kristin; Buchholz, Udo; Prahm, Kerstin; Preuß, Ute; An der Heiden, Matthias; Wolff, Thorsten; Dürrwald, Ralf; Nitsche, Andreas; Michel, Janine; Haas, Walter; Buda, Silke",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,318,16

It has now outspread all over the world. Around 23 million people are currently affected by the novel coronavirus. It causes around 800,000 deaths globally. There are just about 300,000 people contaminated by COVID-19 in Bangladesh too. As it is an exceptional new pandemic infection, its diagnosis is challenging for the medical community. In regular cases, it is hard for developing countries to test cases frequently. The RT - PCR test is a generally utilized analysis framework for COVID-19 case detection. However, by utilizing X-ray image-based programs, recognition can diminish the expense and testing time. So it is important to program an effective recognition system to identify positive cases. In this paper, the author proposes an ensemble deep learning model, combining two state-of-art pre-trained models as ResNet-152 and DenseNet-121 to identify COVID-19 cases. The experimental validation result is immensely well with an accuracy of 98.43% on the proposed model.

In this paper the role of cultural heritage for tourism prior to the COVID-19 pandemic is examined through three empirical perspectives. First, how the Antarctic cultural heritage is represented through the designation of Historic Sites and Monuments and Site Guidelines for Visitors;then how this is presented through tourism operators' websites;and, finally, how it is experienced by visitors as narrated in open-source social media information. Each dataset suggests that, while cultural heritage is an important component of an increasingly commodified tourist offering, it is only part of an assemblage of elements which combine to create a subliminal and largely intangible Antarctic experience. In particular, a polarization of the heritage experience between cultural and natural does not appear productive. The paper proposes a more nuanced understanding of heritage tourism in Antarctica which accommodates the notion of a hybrid experience that integrates cultural heritage, the history and stories this heritage represents, and the natural environmental setting.","Frame, B.; Liggett, D.; Lindstrom, K.; Roura, R.

COVID-19 is associated with the different comorbidities with its change in biological function such as causing heart dysfunction via deregulating ACE-2 receptor, gastrointestinal risk via causing vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, chronic kidney disease via proteinuria and hematuria, diabetes mellitus, liver injury via increasing ALT, AST and bilirubin level, lung injury, CNS risk, ocular risk, and cancer risk. In this, we are focused on the COVID-19 connected with male infertility. Some of the studies show that the patients of COVID-19 are associated with impaired spermatogenesis. Impaired spermatogenesis via COVID-19 decreases the level of testosterone by disturbing cytokines such as TNF-&#945;, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-12 and further, attenuates the sperm count. COVID-19 is causing inflammation via TNF-&#945; and interferons. IL-4 plays an eminent role in the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and leads to the disturbing pro-inflammatory cytokine as well as further cause's male infertility. Th2 activates the IL-4 through IgG and IgE and mediates apoptosis with the triggering of STAT signaling. The activated STAT signaling augments Batf/Irf4, and the Bach2/Batf pathway. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 is activating the level of Th2 cells. So, we hypothesized that the augmented Th2 cells would disturb the level of IL-4, JAK-STAT signaling, Batf/Irf4, and Bach2/Batf pathway. The disturbed IL-4 decreases the level of the ACE-2 with the inflammation. This further leads to male infertility in COVID-19 patients. So, in this hypothesis, we focused on the role of IL-4 in COVID-19 patients associated with male infertility via Th2 cells and JAK-STAT signaling.","Renu, Kaviyarasi; Subramaniam, Mohana Devi; Chakraborty, Rituraj; Myakala, Haritha; Iyer, Mahalaxmi; Bharathi, Geetha; Siva, Kamalakannan; Vellingiri, Balachandar; Valsala Gopalakrishnan, Abilash",J Reprod Immunol,318,16

OBJECTIVE: With person-to-person spread expanding in the United States, we describe hospital preparedness for managing suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients. DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey focused on various elements of respiratory disease preparedness. SETTING: Critical access hospitals (CAHs) and acute-care hospitals (ACHs) in Idaho. METHODS: The electronic survey was sent to infection preventionists (IPs) and nurse administrators in 44 hospitals in Idaho. RESULTS: Overall, 32 (73%) hospitals responded to the survey. Participating facilities reported their preparedness with respect to existing, formalized structures for managing infectious disease incidents-specifically COVID-19-as well as availability of resources, such as isolation rooms and personal protective equipment, for safely managing suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitals covered by the survey had varying levels of preparedness for managing COVID-19 cases, with differences across the various categories of interest in this study. Although the study reveals strengths, including in application of emergency management and infection control frameworks, it also suggests that other areas, such as consistent implementation of federal guidelines and requirements for infection prevention, are potential areas for strengthening preparedness for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory pathogens with pandemic potential.","Kanwar, Anubhav; Heppler, Susan; Kanwar, Kalpana; Brown, Christopher K",Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol,318,16

Despite its use to treat COVID-19 patients and autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis, the effect of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) on cancer immunotherapy has not been examined. In this study, remarkably, we find that HCQ alone, or in combination with azithromycin (AZ), at doses used to treat patients, decreased the therapeutic benefit of anti-PD-1 in cancer immunotherapy. No deleterious effect was seen on untreated tumors. Mechanistically, HCQ and HCQ/AZ inhibited PD-L1 expression on tumor cells, while specifically targeting the anti-PD-1 induced increase in progenitor CD8+CD44+PD-1+TCF1+ tumor infiltrating T cells (TILs) and the generation of CD8+CD44+PD-1+ effectors. Surprisingly, it also impaired the appearance of a subset of terminally exhausted CD8+ TILs. No effect was seen on the presence of CD4+ T cells, FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), thymic subsets, B cells, antibody production, myeloid cells, or the vasculature of mice.

The virus is transmitted through aerosol droplets, and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome. SARS-CoV-2 uses the receptor-binding domain of its spike protein S1 to attach to the host angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in lung and airway cells. Binding requires the help of another host protein, transmembrane protease serine S1 member 2. Several factors likely contribute to the efficient transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 has a 10- to 20-fold higher receptor-binding capacity compared with previous pandemic coronaviruses. In addition, because asymptomatic persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 have high viral loads in their nasal secretions, they can silently and efficiently spread the disease. PCR-based tests have emerged as the criterion standard for the diagnosis of infection. Caution must be exercised in interpreting antibody-based tests because they have not yet been validated, and may give a false sense of security of being ""immune"" to SARS-CoV-2. We discuss how the development of some symptoms in allergic rhinitis can serve as clues for new-onset COVID-19. There are mixed reports that asthma is a risk factor for severe COVID-19, possibly due to differences in asthma endotypes.

Numerous clinical trials have been launched to identify effective treatments for COVID-19. Initial data from a placebo-controlled study suggest faster time to recovery in patients on remdesivir; it is now being evaluated in additional controlled studies. As discussed in this review, till effective vaccines and treatments emerge, it is important to understand the scientific rationale of pandemic-mitigation strategies such as wearing facemasks and social distancing, and implement them.","Hosoki, Koa; Chakraborty, Abhijit; Sur, Sanjiv",J Allergy Clin Immunol,318,21

METHODS: We reviewed the medical charts of four cases of corneal endotheliitis that were CMV-positive. We have classified types of clinical phenomenon into four types: coin-shaped KPs, sectoral corneal edema with or without Khodadoust line-like KPs, mutton-fat KPs, and fine KPs and have graded their severity. We also determined the copy numbers of the DNA of CMV in the aqueous humor by real-time polymerase chain reaction before and during the treatment. We evaluated the correlation between the patterns of clinical characteristics and copy number of the DNA of CMV. RESULTS: There were clinical improvements in all eyes following topical ganciclovir in conjunction with low dose of topical steroid treatment, with or without oral valganciclovir. The clinical characteristics and the copy numbers of the DNA of CMV varied during the treatment period. The presence of coin-shaped KPs was correlated with high copy numbers (105-103 copies/ml) of the DNA of CMV. The copy numbers of the DNA of CMV with sectoral corneal edema with or without Khodadoust line-like KPs ranged from 104 to 102 copies/ml, and it was occasionally accompanied by high intraocular pressure. Mutton-fat KPs were observed inferiorly, sometimes together with coin-shaped KPs and sectoral corneal edema, or solely. The copy numbers in eyes with mutton-fat KPs varied and occasionally less than the cutoff level. Fine-pigmented KPs were observed after the resolution of the endotheliitis, and no DNA of CMV was detected in the aqueous humor. CONCLUSIONS: Careful observations of the clinical characteristics such as the KPs and corneal edema might be helpful in estimating the amount of the DNA of CMV in eyes with corneal endotheliitis.","Yoshimura, Ayano; Araki-Sasaki, Kaoru; Toyokawa, Noriko; Fujiwara, Rho; Jho, Nobuo; Gomi, Fumi",Int. ophthalmol,318,1

Different assays were used: a commercial ELISA detecting antibodies against the recombinant spike protein (S1); a multiplex assay detecting total and specific antibody isotypes against three SARS-CoV-2 antigens (S1, basic nucleocapsid (N) protein and receptor-binding domain (RBD)); and an in-house ELISA detecting antibodies to complete spike, RBD and N in 60 of these donors. Neutralizing antibodies (NAb) were also evaluated in these 60 donors. Analyzed samples were collected at a median time of 62 (14–104) days from the day of first symptoms or positive PCR (for asymptomatic patients). Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 88% and 87.8% of donors using the ELISA and the multiplex assay, respectively. The multivariate analysis showed that age ≥50 years (p < 0.001) and need for hospitalization (p < 0.001) correlated with higher antibody titers, while asymptomatic status (p < 0.001) and testing >60 days after symptom onset (p = 0.001) correlated with lower titers. Interestingly, pseudotype virus-neutralizing antibodies (PsNAbs) significantly correlated with spike and with RBD antibodies by ELISA. Sera with high PsNAb also showed a strong ability to neutralize active SARS-CoV-2 virus, with hospitalized patients showing higher titers. Therefore, convalescent plasma donors can be selected based on the presence of high RBD antibody titers.","Terpos, Evangelos; Politou, Marianna; Sergentanis, Theodoros N.; Mentis, Andreas; Rosati, Margherita; Stellas, Dimitris; Bear, Jenifer; Hu, Xintao; Felber, Barbara K.; Pappa, Vassiliki; Pagoni, Maria; Grouzi, Elisavet; Labropoulou, Stavroula; Charitaki, Ioanna; Ntanasis-Stathopoulos, Ioannis; Moschandreou, Dimitra; Bouhla, Anthi; Saridakis, Stylianos; Korompoki, Eleni; Giatra, Chara; Bagratuni, Tina; Pefanis, Angelos; Papageorgiou, Sotirios; Spyridonidis, Alexandros; Antoniadou, Anastasia; Kotanidou, Anastasia; Syrigos, Konstantinos; Stamoulis, Konstantinos; Panayiotakopoulos, George; Tsiodras, Sotirios; Alexopoulos, Leonidas; Dimopoulos, Meletios A.; Pavlakis, George N.",Microorganisms,318,30

They are concerned about the reciprocal interaction between connective tissue diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and the virus. Here, we report a 21-year-old female SLE patient presented to the emergency department with gastrointestinal symptoms and kidney involvement evidence. Based on the pathology and laboratory assessments, she was suspected of C-anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) positive SLE and ANCA-associated vasculitis overlap syndrome (SLE/AAV OS), and plasmapheresis every other day was performed due to this diagnosis alongside the high titer of C-ANCA. We also administered methylprednisolone (1 g/day, IV) for three days, followed by dexamethasone with the maintenance dosage (1mg/kg/day, IV). Although the patient’s general condition improved the next days, her condition deteriorated suddenly on the 7th day of hospitalization. She got intubated and went to the intensive care unit. Despite taking possible measures to manage the patient’s condition, she eventually passed away due to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), triggered by COVID-19. The distinct role of C-ANCA in SLE/AAV vascular damage and activating neutrophil cytokine release accompanied by the impaired immune system while facing COVID-19 seems to lead to increased morbidity and mortality in such patients. This report was presented to bring into consideration the possible role of C-ANCA in the burden and prognosis of COVID-19 in SLE/AAV OS patients.","Mashinchi, Baharnaz; Aryannejad, Armin; Namazi, Mansoor; Moradi, Soroush; Masoumi, Zahra; Parsaei, Amirhossein; Masoumi, Maryam",Mod Rheumatol Case Rep,318,13

In previous studies and reports from the UK and US evidence emerged that poverty related indicators had a significant statistical effect on case and mortality rates on district level. For Germany, it has largely been assumed that poverty is an equally relevant factor influencing the transmission rates of the outbreak mostly due to anecdotal evidence from local outbreaks in meat processing plants and reported incidents in poorer city districts. This paper addresses the lack of statistical evidence and investigates thoroughly the link between poverty related indicators and case and mortality rates of the outbreak using multivariate, multilevel regression while also considering the urban-rural divide of the country. As proxies for poverty the unemployment rate, the per capita presence of general practitioners (physicians), per capita GDP, and the rate of employees with no professional job training is evaluated in relation to the accumulated case and mortality numbers on district level taken from RKI data of June and July 2020. Interestingly, the study finds no evidence for a poverty-related effect on mortality for German districts. Furthermore, only employment in low qualification jobs approximated by the job training variable consistently affected case numbers in urban districts in the expected direction.","Ettensperger, F.",,318,24

In China and many other nations, universities have introduced compulsory remote education programs such as mobile learning (m-learning) to prevent public health hazards caused by the pandemic. However, so far, there is still a lack of understanding of student’s learning experience responses in compulsory m-learning programs. As such, there is a necessity to explore the factors and mechanisms which drives students’ experience. This paper evaluates the influence of both pedagogy and technology on learner’s compulsory m-learning experience response (ER) by extending the mobile technology acceptance model (MTAM) during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data, which was then analysed through SmartPLS 3.2.9. Importance-performance matrix analysis was applied as a post-hoc procedure to gauge the importance and performance of the exogenous constructs. The results revealed that perceptions of m-learning’s learning content quality, user interface, and system’s connectivity affect the perceived mobile usefulness and easiness which in turn affects ER. This paper validates MTAM in the field of education by integrating MTAM with pedagogy and technology attributes under a social emergency setting such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the current research explains users' ER rather than behaviour intention which is commonly adopted in past studies.","Yuan, Yun-Peng; Wei-Han Tan, Garry; Ooi, Keng-Boon; Lim, Wei-Lee",Telematics and Informatics,318,3

The epidemic started in Wuhan, China, in December of 2019 and quickly spread to over 200 countries. It has affected 4,258,666 people, with 294,190 deaths worldwide by May 15, 2020. COVID-19 is characterized by acute respiratory disease, with 80% of patients presenting mild like flu-like symptoms; however, 20% of patients may have a severe or critical clinical presentation, which likely causes multiple organ injuries (e.g., kidney, heart, blood, and nervous system). Among them, acute kidney injury (AKI) is a critical complication due to its high incidence and mortality rate. Here we present a review of the current understanding of AKI in COVID-19. SUMMARY: CO­VID-19 is a catastrophic contagious disease caused by the coronavirus, and the AKI induced by COVID-19 significantly increases the mortality rate. In this review, we summarize the clinical characteristics of COVID-19 induced AKI by focusing on its epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical diagnosis, and treatment. KEY MESSAGES: Multiple studies have shown that COVID-19 may involve the kidneys and cause AKI. This article reviews the characteristics of COVID-19-induced AKI largely based on up-to-date studies in the hope that it will be helpful in the current global fight against and treatment of COVID-19.","Qian, Jing-Yi; Wang, Bin; Liu, Bi-Cheng",Kidney Dis (Basel),318,33

Although in their professional activity health workers are closely linked to death processes, in recent months, working conditions and health emergencies have drawn an unheard of working scenario, with the stress and anxiety they may suffer when faced with the death of their patients. The present quantitative research was carried out in different hospitals in Spain on health professionals during the month of April 2020. Through the subscale of anxiety in the face of the death of others, developed by Collett–Lester, it has been verified that health professionals have had to develop their work in a context of precariousness, putting at risk both their individual and collective health, notably increasing anxiety in the face of the death of their patients. The predictive variables of this anxiety have been the absence of individual protection equipment, as well as high levels in the burnout subscales of emotional exhaustion and depersonalization.","Lázaro-Pérez, Cristina; Martínez-López, Jose Ángel; Gómez-Galán, José; López-Meneses, Eloy",Int J Environ Res Public Health,318,26

The primary outcome is any superinfection within 90 days of admission to the ICU. We will use logistic regression analysis comparing COVID‐19 with influenza A/B after adjustment for relevant predefined confounders. Secondarily, we will use unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression analyses to assess six potential risk factors (sex, age, cancer (including haematological), immunosuppression, use of life support on day 1 in the ICU) for superinfections, and compare outcomes in patients with COVID‐19 with/without superinfections, and present descriptive data regarding the superinfections.

We hypothesized that a community-centered vaccination strategy that included mobilization, vaccination, and ""activation"" components could successfully reach an underserved Latinx population, utilizing its social networks to boost vaccination coverage. Methods and Findings Our community-academic-public health partnership, ""Unidos en Salud,"" utilized a theory-informed approach to design our ""Motivate, Vaccinate, and Activate"" COVID-19 vaccination strategy. Our strategy's design was guided by the PRECEDE Model and sought to address and overcome predisposing, enabling, and reinforcing barriers to COVID-19 vaccination faced by Latinx individuals in San Francisco. We evaluated our prototype outdoor, ""neighborhood"" vaccination program located in a central commercial and transport hub in the Mission District in San Francisco, using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework during a 16-week period from February 1, 2021 to May 19, 2021. Programmatic data, city-wide COVID-19 surveillance data, and a survey conducted between May 2, 2021 and May 19, 2021 among 997 vaccinated clients at least 16 years old were used in the evaluation. There were 20,792 COVID-19 vaccinations administered at the neighborhood site during the 16-week evaluation period. Vaccine recipients had a median age of 43 (IQR 32-56) years, 53.9% were male and 70.5% were Latinx, 14.1% white, 7.7% Asian, 2.4% Black, and 5.3% other. Latinx vaccinated clients were substantially more likely than non-Latinx clients to have an annual household income of less than $50,000 a year (76.1% vs. 33.5%), be a first-generation immigrant (60.2% vs. 30.1%), not have health insurance (47.3% vs. 16.0%), and not have access to primary care provider (62.4% vs. 36.2%). The most frequently reported reasons for choosing vaccination at the site were its neighborhood location (28.6%), easy and convenient scheduling (26.9%) and recommendation by someone they trusted (18.1%); approximately 99% reported having an overall positive experience, regardless of ethnicity. Notably, 58.3% of clients reported that they were able to get vaccinated earlier because of the neighborhood vaccination site, 98.4% of clients completed both vaccine doses, and 90.7% said that they were more likely to recommend COVID-19 vaccination to family and friends after their experience; these findings did not substantially differ according to ethnicity. There were 40.3% of vaccinated clients who said they still knew at least one unvaccinated person (64.6% knew 3 or more). Among clients who received both vaccine doses (n=729), 91.0% said that after their vaccination experience, they had personally reached out to at least one unvaccinated person they knew (61.6% reached out to 3 or more) to recommend getting vaccinated; 83.0% of clients reported that one or more friends, and/or family members got vaccinated as a result of their outreach, including 18.9% who reported 6 or more persons got vaccinated as a result of their influence.

A growing body of work has focused on how best to promote adoption and use of these technologies and measure their impacts on processes of care and outcomes. This body of work currently suffers from limitations (eg, cross-sectional analyses, limited patient-generated data linked with clinical records) and would benefit from institutional infrastructure to enhance available data and integrate the voice of the patient into implementation and evaluation efforts. OBJECTIVE: The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) has launched an initiative called the Veterans Engagement with Technology Collaborative cohort to directly address these challenges. This paper reports the process by which the cohort was developed and describes the baseline data being collected from cohort members. The overarching goal of the Veterans Engagement with Technology Collaborative cohort is to directly engage veterans in the evaluation of new VHA patient-facing technologies and in so doing, to create new infrastructure to support related quality improvement and evaluation activities. METHODS: Inclusion criteria for veterans to be eligible for membership in the cohort included being an active user of VHA health care services, having a mobile phone, and being an established user of existing VHA patient-facing technologies as represented by use of the secure messaging feature of VHA’s patient portal. Between 2017 and 2018, we recruited veterans who met these criteria and administered a survey to them over the telephone. RESULTS: The majority of participants (N=2727) were male (2268/2727, 83.2%), White (2226/2727, 81.6%), living in their own apartment or house (2519/2696, 93.4%), and had completed some college (1176/2701, 43.5%) or an advanced degree (1178/2701, 43.6%). Cohort members were 59.9 years old, on average. The majority self-reported their health status as being good (1055/2725, 38.7%) or very good (524/2725, 19.2%). Most cohort members owned a personal computer (2609/2725, 95.7%), tablet computer (1616/2716, 59.5%), and/or smartphone (2438/2722, 89.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The Veterans Engagement with Technology Collaborative cohort is an example of a VHA learning health care system initiative designed to support the data-driven implementation of patient-facing technologies into practice and measurement of their impacts. With this initiative, VHA is building capacity for future, rapid, rigorous evaluation and quality improvement efforts to enhance understanding of the adoption, use, and impact of patient-facing technologies.","Etingen, Bella; Amante, Daniel J; Martinez, Rachael N; Smith, Bridget M; Shimada, Stephanie L; Richardson, Lorilei; Patterson, Angela; Houston, Thomas K; Frisbee, Kathleen L; Hogan, Timothy P",J Particip Med,318,20

Endoscopy units, endoscopists, and other HCP may be at a significant risk for transmission of the virus. Given the immense burden on the healthcare system and surge in the number of patients with COVID-19, well-designed protocols and recommendations are needed. We aimed to systematically characterize our approach to endoscopic procedures in a quaternary university hospital setting and provide summary protocol recommendations. METHOD: This descriptive study details a COVID-19-specific protocol designed to minimize infection risks to patients and healthcare workers in the endoscopy unit. RESULTS: Our institution, located in São Paulo, Brazil, includes a 900-bed hospital, with a 200-bed-specific intensive care unit exclusively designed for patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. We highlighted recommendations for infection prevention and control during endoscopic procedures, including appropriate triage and screening, outpatient management and procedural recommendations, role and usage of personal protective equipment (PPE), and role and procedural logistics involving COVID-19-positive patients. We also detailed hospital protocols for reprocessing endoscopes and cleaning rooms and also provided recommendations to minimize severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 transmission. CONCLUSION: This COVID-19-specific administrative and clinical protocol can be replicated or adapted in multiple institutions and endoscopy units worldwide. Furthermore, the recommendations and summary protocol may improve patient and HCP safety in these trying times.","Franzini, Tomazo Antonio Prince; Kotinda, Ana Paula Samy Tanaka; de Moura, Diogo Turiani Hourneaux; Badana, Márcia Lopes Vicente; de Medeiros, Marion Sielfeld; Lima, Patrícia Goulart Rodrigues; de Mello, Brigitte Feiner; Kayano, Rafael Priante; Carmona, Maria José Carvalho; Rocha, Marcelo Cristiano; Campos, Aléia Faustina; McCarty, Thomas R.; Guimarães, Thaís; Moura, Maria Luisa do Nascimento; Thompson, Christopher C.; de Moura, Eduardo Guimarães Hourneaux",Clinics (Sao Paulo),318,20

Bovine enterovirus (BEV) has recently been reclassified into E and F serotypes. BEV was first isolated in Egypt in 1966 although it has been known in other countries since the 1950s. In this study, BEV-F2 was isolated from calves with severe diarrhea and the isolated viruses were subjected to molecular characterization. Illumina sequencing of one of the isolates revealed the presence of a complete BEV-F genome sequence. The phylogenetic analysis revealed nucleotide substitutions along the genome in comparison with other known strains of BEV-F (HQ663846, AY508697 and DQ092795). Two primer sets were designed from the 3D and 5′NTR regions and used for the examination of the remaining isolates, which were confirmed to be of the BEV-F2 serotype.

The purine derivative of the potent screening hit T-00127-HEV1 has served as a suitable starting point for a thorough investigation of positions 8 and 2. While position 8 of the purine scaffold can only bear a small substituent to maintain the inhibitory activity, position 2 is opened for extensive modification and can accommodate even substituted phenyl rings without the loss of PI4K IIIβ inhibitory activity. These empirical observations nicely correlate with the results of our docking study, which suggests that position 2 directs towards solution and can provide the necessary space for the interaction with remote residues of the enzyme, whereas the cavity around position 8 is strictly limited.

While advanced imaging is a great resource for diagnostic purposes, the risk of contamination and infection transmission is high and requires extensive logistical planning for intrahospital patient transport, healthcare provider safety, and post-imaging decontamination. This dilemma has necessitated the transition to more bedside imaging. More so than ever, during the current pandemic, the clinical utility and importance of point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) cannot be overstressed. It allows for safe and efficient beside procedural guidance and provides front line providers with valuable diagnostic information that can be acted upon in real-time for immediate clinical decision-making. The authors have been routinely using POCUS for the management of COVID-19 patients both in the emergency department and in intensive care units turned into “COVID-units.” In this article, we review the nuances of using POCUS in a pandemic situation and maximizing diagnostic output from this bedside technology. Additionally, we review various methods and diagnostic uses of POCUS which can replace conventional imaging and bridge current literature and common clinical practices in critically ill patients. We discuss practical guidance and pertinent review of the literature for the most relevant procedural and diagnostic guidance of respiratory illness, hemodynamic decompensation, renal failure, and gastrointestinal disorders experienced by many patients admitted to COVID-units.","Deshwal, Himanshu; Pradhan, Deepak; Mukherjee, Vikramjit",World J Crit Care Med,318,20

Dentists were recruited via email and Instagram®. Responses to a pre-tested questionnaire were collected May 15–24, 2020. COVID-19 case/death counts in the state where respondents work was used to test associations between contextual status and decreases in weekly appointments, fear of contracting COVID-19 at work, and current work status (α = 0.05). Over 10 days, 3,122 responses were received (response rate ~2.1%) from all Brazilian states. Work status was affected for 94%, with less developed regions being more impacted. The pandemic impact on clinical routine was high/very high for 84%, leading to varied changes to clinic infrastructure, personal protective equipment use, and patient screening, as well as increased costs. COVID-19 patients had been seen by 5.3% of respondents; 90% reported fearing contracting COVID-19 at work. Multilevel models showed that greater case and death rates (counted as 1000 cases and 100 deaths per million inhabitants) in one’s state increased the odds of being fearful of contracting the disease (18% and 25%). For each additional 1000 cases/100 deaths, the odds of currently not working or treating only emergencies increased by 36% and 58%. The reduction in patients seen weekly was significantly greater in public (38.7±18.6) than in private clinics (22.5±17.8). This study provides early evidence of three major impacts of the pandemic on dentistry: increasing inequalities due to coverage differences between public and private networks; the adoption of new clinical routines, which are associated with an economic burden for dentists; and associations of regional COVID-19 incidence/mortality with fear of contracting the disease at work.","Moraes, Rafael R.; Correa, Marcos B.; Queiroz, Ana B.; Daneris, Ândrea; Lopes, João P.; Pereira-Cenci, Tatiana; D’Avila, Otávio P.; Cenci, Maximiliano S.; Lima, Giana S.; Demarco, Flávio F.",PLoS One,318,16

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-three subjects with hemianopia and 33 controls were tested with the CU-VF software on a personal computer and SAP. Hemianopia was defined as the presence of a hemianopic field respecting the vertical meridian on SAP with the corresponding neuroimaging pathology as evaluated by 2 neuro-ophthalmologists. Results of CU-VF were independently evaluated by 2 neuro-ophthalmologists, 1 general ophthalmologist, and 1 general practitioner in terms of the presence of hemianopia. Sensitivity, specificity, and kappa coefficient for inter-observer reliability were calculated. Satisfaction and ease of use were evaluated with a visual analog-scale questionnaire and analyzed using paired t-test. RESULTS: The sensitivity (95% CI) and specificity (95% CI) of the CU-VF to detect hemianopia was 74.42% (58.53–85.96) and 93.94% (78.38–99.94).

Many clinical trials have been initiated to fight the disease. Among those, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin had initially been suggested to improve clinical outcomes. Despite any demonstrated beneficial effects, they are still in use in some countries but have been reported to prolong the QT interval and induce life-threatening arrhythmia. Since a significant proportion of the world population may be treated with such COVID-19 therapies, evaluation of the arrhythmogenic risk of any candidate drug is needed. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using the O'Hara-Rudy computer model of human ventricular wedge, we evaluate the arrhythmogenic potential of clinical factors that can further alter repolarization in COVID-19 patients in addition to hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM) such as tachycardia, hypokalaemia, and subclinical to mild long QT syndrome. Hydroxychloroquine and AZM drugs have little impact on QT duration and do not induce any substrate prone to arrhythmia in COVID-19 patients with normal cardiac repolarization reserve. Nevertheless, in every tested condition in which this reserve is reduced, the model predicts larger electrocardiogram impairments, as with dofetilide. In subclinical conditions, the model suggests that mexiletine limits the deleterious effects of AZM and HCQ. CONCLUSION: By studying the HCQ and AZM co-administration case, we show that the easy-to-use O'Hara-Rudy model can be applied to assess the QT-prolongation potential of off-label drugs, beyond HCQ and AZM, in different conditions representative of COVID-19 patients and to evaluate the potential impact of additional drug used to limit the arrhythmogenic risk.","Montnach, Jérôme; Baró, Isabelle; Charpentier, Flavien; De Waard, Michel; Loussouarn, Gildas",Europace,318,12

Such experiences may similarly facilitate the identification, and avoidance, of diseased conspecifics. The current experiment sought to replicate and extend previous crowding research.

RESULTS: Crowding-primed participants reported a more heightened preferences for healthy faces than control-primed participants. Additionally, crowd salience reduced aversion toward healthy faces but did not heighten aversion to diseased faces. CONCLUSION: Results suggest crowding appears to heighten tolerance for health cues given the heightened proximal threat of infections through interpersonal contact within crowded environments. Conversely, this work extends previous findings by indicating this preference is not rooted in an aversion to cues of poor health.

ACE2 is a host ectopeptidase with well-described anti-inflammatory and tissue protective functions and the receptor for the virus. Understanding SARS-CoV-2-ACE2 interaction and the expression of antiviral host genes in early infection phase is crucial for fighting the pandemic. We tested the significance of soluble ACE2 enzymatic activity longitudinally in positive nasopharyngeal swabs at two time points after symptom consultation, along with gene expression profiles of ACE2, its proteases, ADAM17 and TMPRRS2, and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs), DDX58, CXCL10 and IL-6. Soluble ACE2 activity decreased during infection course, in parallel to ACE2 gene expression. On the contrary, SARS-CoV-2 infection induced expression of the ISG genes in positive SARS-CoV-2 samples at baseline compared to negative control subjects, although this increase wanes with time. These changes positively correlated with viral load. Our results demonstrate the existence of mechanisms by which SARS-CoV-2 suppress ACE2 expression and function casting doubt on the IFN-induced upregulation of the receptor. Moreover, we show that initial intracellular viral sensing and subsequent ISG induction is also rapidly downregulated. Overall, our results offer new insights into ACE2 dynamics and inflammatory response in the human upper respiratory tract that may contribute to understand the early antiviral host response to SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Gutiérrez-Chamorro, Lucía; Riveira-Muñoz, Eva; Barrios, Clara; Palau, Vanesa; Massanella, Marta; Garcia-Vidal, Edurne; Badia, Roger; Pedreño, Sònia; Senserrich, Jordi; Rodríguez, Eva; Clotet, Bonaventura; Cabrera, Cecilia; Mitjà, Oriol; Crespo, Marta; Pascual, Julio; Riera, Marta; Ballana, Ester",bioRxiv,318,16

Headache and myalgia were more frequent in the newly licensed vaccines (OR = 1.97, 95% CI = 1.28–3.06, p = 0.02 and OR = 3.31, 95% CI = 2.05–5.35, p < 0.001) and younger adults (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.12–1.75, p = 0.003 and OR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.20–1.96, p < 0.001). In four open-label trials, the incidences of headache, myalgia, and unsolicited NMAEs were 38.7%, 27.4%, and 1.5%. Following vaccination in phase 3 trials, headache and myalgia were still common with a rate of 29.5% and 19.2%, although the unsolicited NMAEs with incidence rates of ≤ 0.7% were not different from the control group in each study. Conclusions: Following the vaccination, NMAEs are common of which headache and myalgia comprised a considerable measure, although life-threatening unsolicited events are rare. NMAEs should be continuously monitored during the ongoing global COVID-19 vaccination program.","Chen, Jiaxin; Cai, Yuangui; Chen, Yicong; Williams, Anthony P.; Gao, Yifang; Zeng, Jinsheng",Vaccines (Basel),318,26

Given the pandemic urgency and lack of an effective cure for this disease, drug repurposing could open the way for finding a solution. Lots of investigations are ongoing to test the compounds already identified as antivirals. On the other hand, induction of type I interferons are found to play an important role in the generation of immune responses against SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, it was opined that the antivirals capable of triggering the interferons and their signaling pathway, could rationally be beneficial for treating COVID-19. On this basis, using a database of antivirals, called drugvirus, some antiviral agents were derived, followed by searches on their relevance to interferon induction. The examined list included drugs from different categories such as antibiotics, immunosuppressants, anti-cancers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), calcium channel blocker compounds, and some others. The results as briefed here, could help in finding potential drug candidates for COVID-19 treatment. However, their advantages and risks should be taken into account through precise studies, considering a systemic approach. Even though the adverse effects of some of these drugs may overweight their benefits, considering their mechanisms and structures may give a clue for designing novel drugs in the future. Furthermore, the antiviral effect and IFN-modifying mechanisms possessed by some of these drugs might lead to a synergistic effect against SARS-CoV-2, which deserve to be evaluated in further investigations.","Bagheri, Ashkan; Mohammad Iman Moezzi, Seyed; Mosaddeghi, Pouria; Nadimi Parashkouhi, Sadra; Mostafa Fazel Hoseini, Seyed; Badakhshan, Fatemeh; Negahdaripour, Manica",Int Immunopharmacol,318,33

The goal of these studies is to reduce the number of lead drug candidates down to the most likely to succeed in later human clinical trials. However, only 1 in 10 drug candidates that emerge from preclinical studies will succeed and become an approved therapeutic. Lack of efficacy or undetected toxicity represents roughly 75% of the causes for these failures, despite these parameters being the primary exclusion criteria in preclinical studies. Recently, advances in both biology and engineering have created new tools for constructing new preclinical models. These models can complement those used in current preclinical studies by helping to create more realistic representations of human tissues in vitro and in vivo. In this review, we describe current preclinical models to identify their value and limitations and then discuss select areas of research where improvements in preclinical models are particularly needed to advance drug development. Following this, we discuss design considerations for constructing preclinical models and then highlight recent advances in these efforts. Taken together, we aim to review the advances as of 2020 surrounding the prospect of biological and engineering tools for adding enhanced biological relevance to preclinical studies to aid in the challenges of failed drug candidates and the burden this poses on the drug development enterprise and thus healthcare.","Khalil, Andrew S.; Jaenisch, Rudolf; Mooney, David J.",Adv Drug Deliv Rev,318,1

This study was conducted to identify the noncompliance rate of self-quarantine for COVID-19 cases and assess the impact of a 1-strike out policy and an increased amount of penalty for the violating self-quarantine in South Korea. METHODS: The self-quarantine noncompliance rate for COVID-19 was examined using publicly available data. We collected the daily number of quarantine and quarantine violation cases from March 22 to June 10, 2020. A Poisson regression analysis was conducted to identify the impact of additional sanctions for the quarantine violation. RESULTS: The median number of individuals quarantined per day was 36,561 (interquartile range, 34,408-41,961). The median number of daily self-quarantine violations was 6 (range, 0-13). The median rate of self-quarantine violations was 1.6 per 10,000 self-quarantined individuals (range, 0.0-8.0 per 10,000 self-quarantined individuals). The additional sanction has no significant impact on the number of violations among quarantine individuals (P = 0.99). CONCLUSIONS: The additional sanction for the violation of quarantined individuals did not reduce the self-quarantine violations. Further studies are warranted to strengthen the compliance of self-quarantine for future pandemics.","Ryu, Sukhyun; Hwang, Youngsik; Yoon, Hongbi; Chun, Byung Chul",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,318,20

The present study showed that BAstV was associated with the gastroenteric tracts of cattle in nine positive fecal samples from 115 cattle, whereas no positive samples were found in the brain tissues of 14 downer cattle. Interestingly, the positive diarrheal samples were obtained mainly from calves aged 14 days–3 months. Bayesian inference tree analysis of the partial ORF1ab and capsid (ORF2) gene sequences of BAstVs identified four divergent groups. Eleven BAstVs, four porcine astroviruses, and two deer astroviruses (DAstVs; CcAstV-1 and -2) belonged to group 1; group 2 contained two BAstVs (BAstK08–51 and BAstK10–96) with another two in group 3 (BAstK08–2 and BAstK08–53); and group 4 comprised the BAstV-NeuroS1 strain derived from a cattle brain tissue sample and an ovine astrovirus.

This study examined the prevalence of fatigue and its association with quality of life (QOL) among nursing students during the post-COVID-19 era in China. METHODS: This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study. Nursing students in five Chinese universities were invited to participate. Fatigue, depressive and anxiety symptoms, pain and QOL were measured using standardized instruments. RESULTS: A total of 1,070 nursing students participated. The prevalence of fatigue was 67.3% (95% CI [64.4–70.0]). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that male gender (P = 0.003, OR = 1.73, 95% CI [1.20–2.49]), and being a senior nursing student (second year: OR = 2.20, 95% CI [1.46–3.33], P < 0.001; third year: OR = 3.53, 95% CI [2.31–5.41], P < 0.001; and fourth year OR = 3.59, 95% CI [2.39–5.40], P < 0.001) were significantly associated with more severe fatigue. In addition, moderate economic loss during the COVID-19 pandemic (OR = 1.48, 95% CI [1.08–3.33], P < 0.015; compared to low loss), participants with more severe depressive (OR = 1.48, 95% CI [1.22–1.78], P < 0.001) and anxiety symptoms (OR = 1.12, 95% CI [1.05–1.20], P = 0.001), and more severe pain (OR = 1.67, 95%CI [1.46–1.91], P < 0.001) were significantly associated with reported more severe fatigue. After controlling for covariates, nursing students with fatigue had a lower overall QOL score compared to those without (F((1, 1070)) = 31.4, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Fatigue was common among nursing students in the post-COVID-19 era. Considering the negative impact of fatigue on QOL and daily functioning, routine physical and mental health screening should be conducted for nursing students. Effective stress-reduction measures should be enforced to assist this subpopulation to combat fatigue and restore optimal health.","Liu, Shou; Xi, Hai-Tao; Zhu, Qian-Qian; Ji, Mengmeng; Zhang, Hongyan; Yang, Bing-Xiang; Bai, Wei; Cai, Hong; Zhao, Yan-Jie; Chen, Li; Ge, Zong-Mei; Wang, Zhiwen; Han, Lin; Chen, Pan; Liu, Shuo; Cheung, Teris; Hall, Brian J.; An, Feng-Rong; Xiang, Yu-Tao",PeerJ,318,1

Here we present findings from an entomological surveillance study that began in Córdoba, Argentina, following the emergence of dengue in 2009. METHODS: From 2009 to 2017, larval surveys were conducted monthly, from November to May, in 600 randomly selected households distributed across the city. From 2009 to 2013, ovitraps (n = 177) were sampled weekly to monitor the oviposition activity of Ae. aegypti. We explored seasonal and interannual dynamics of entomological variables and dengue transmission. Cross correlation analysis was used to identify significant lag periods. RESULTS: Aedes aegypti were detected over the entire study period, and abundance peaked during the summer months (January to March). We identified a considerable increase in the proportion of homes with juvenile Ae. aegypti over the study period (from 5.7% of homes in 2009–10 to 15.4% of homes in 2016–17). Aedes aegypti eggs per ovitrap and larval abundance were positively associated with temperature in the same month. Autochthonous dengue transmission peaked in April, following a peak in imported dengue cases in March; autochthonous dengue was not positively associated with vector or climate variables. CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study provides insights into the complex dynamics of arbovirus transmission and vector populations in a temperate region of arbovirus emergence. Our findings suggest that Córdoba is well suited for arbovirus disease transmission, given the stable and abundant vector populations. Further studies are needed to better understand the role of regional human movement.","Estallo, Elizabet L.; Sippy, Rachel; Stewart-Ibarra, Anna M.; Grech, Marta G.; Benitez, Elisabet M.; Ludueña-Almeida, Francisco F.; Ainete, Mariela; Frias-Cespedes, María; Robert, Michael; Romero, Moory M.; Almirón, Walter R.",Heliyon,318,18

Therefore, fundamental knowledge on transmission routes that could be used to improve intervention strategies is still missing.

We tested inhibition of host cell nucleotide synthesis as a promising strategy to decrease the replication of SARS-CoV-2-RNA, thus diminishing the formation of virus progeny. Methotrexate (MTX) is an established drug for cancer therapy and to induce immunosuppression. The drug inhibits dihydrofolate reductase and other enzymes required for the synthesis of nucleotides. Strikingly, the replication of SARS-CoV-2 was inhibited by MTX in therapeutic concentrations around 1 µM, leading to more than 1000-fold reductions in virus progeny in Vero C1008 (Vero E6) and ∼100-fold reductions in Calu-3 cells. Virus replication was more sensitive to equivalent concentrations of MTX than of the established antiviral agent remdesivir. MTX strongly diminished the synthesis of viral structural proteins and the amount of released virus RNA. Virus replication and protein synthesis were rescued by folinic acid (leucovorin) and also by inosine, indicating that purine depletion is the principal mechanism that allows MTX to reduce virus RNA synthesis. The combination of MTX with remdesivir led to synergistic impairment of virus replication, even at 100 nM MTX. The use of MTX in treating SARS-CoV-2 infections still awaits further evaluation regarding toxicity and efficacy in infected organisms, rather than cultured cells. Within the frame of these caveats, however, our results raise the perspective of a two-fold benefit from repurposing MTX for treating COVID-19. Firstly, its previously known ability to reduce aberrant inflammatory responses might dampen respiratory distress. In addition, its direct antiviral activity described here would limit the dissemination of the virus.","Stegmann, Kim M.; Dickmanns, Antje; Gerber, Sabrina; Nikolova, Vella; Klemke, Luisa; Manzini, Valentina; Schlösser, Denise; Bierwirth, Cathrin; Freund, Julia; Sitte, Maren; Lugert, Raimond; Salinas, Gabriela; Meister, Toni Luise; Pfaender, Stephanie; Görlich, Dirk; Wollnik, Bernd; Groß, Uwe; Dobbelstein, Matthias",Virus Res,318,1

The initial outbreak of this novel virus in Wuhan in the Hubei province of China, first described in December 2019, has since moved on to being declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The classic description of COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that manifests with fever, dry cough, and dyspnea on exertion. However, gastrointestinal (GI) complication of COVID-19 is emerging as well. This was observed with similar viral respiratory illnesses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which emerged in 2003, and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), which emerged in 2012. In a recently published, single-center case series of 138 consecutive hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-19, investigators reported that approximately 10% of patients initially presented with GI symptoms, prior to the subsequent development of respiratory symptoms. Common and often very subtle symptoms included diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain, with a less common symptom being nonspecific GI illness. New studies are expanding our understanding of the possible fecal transmission of COVID-19. Assessment by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has provided evidence of the virus in the stool and the oropharynx outside the nasopharynx and respiratory tract. Virus in the stool may be evident on presentation and last throughout the course of illness resolution for up to 12 days after the respiratory virus evidence is gone. In fact, in one of the most recent studies looking at 73 patients, approximately 24% remained positive in their stool for evidence of the virus, though not necessarily infection, after showing negative in respiratory samples. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that after two negative respiratory tests separated by ≥ 24 hours, patients can be dismissed from having transmissibility infection risk for COVID-19. The potential for fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 needs to be strongly considered. Considering these cases and the lessons from SARS, many authors recommend that real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from feces should be performed routinely in SARS-CoV-2 patients.","Cipriano, Massimiliano; Ruberti, Enzo; Giacalone, Andrea",Cureus,318,20

RESULTS: Among 9,842 patients treated at Institut Curie between March 13 and May 1, 2020, 141 (1.4%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, based on RT-PCR testing and/or CT-scan. In line with our case-mix, breast cancer (40.4%) was the most common tumor type, followed by hematological and lung malignancies. Patients with active cancer therapy or/and advanced cancer accounted for 87.9% and 68.9% of patients, respectively. At diagnosis, 78.7% of patients had COVID-19 related symptoms, with an extent of lung parenchyma involvement inferior to 50% in 95.8% of patients.

The project compares the results of various tests between a group of children with Cerebral Visual Impairments (CVI) (N = 4) and an age-matched sample of children without CVI (N = 3) from a pediatric low vision clinic. This model was trialed with a small convenient sample of typically developing children in the same age range (N = 4). Given the positive feedback, recruitment for the larger study was done via encrypted e-mail rather than through traditional mailing. The asynchronous components included recruitment, pre-assessment information, the Flemish CVI questionnaire, Vineland-3 comprehensive parent questionnaire for assessment of age equivalent, and vision function tests, such as contrast sensitivity. The synchronous components were administered via Zoom telehealth provided by necoeyecare.org and included assessment of visual acuity via the Freiburg Visual Acuity and Contrast Test (FrACT) electronic software and assessment of visual perceptual batteries via the Children’s Visual Impairment Test for developmental ages 3–6-years (CVIT 3–6).

The third part is a quantitative risk analysis based on a complex network model, integrating two types of WO. The Fuzzy set theory is introduced to calculate the failure probabilities of risk factors and the concept of risk entropy is used to represent the uncertainty. Then the Dijkstra algorithm is used to calculate the shortest path and the corresponding probability of the accident.

This application provides valuable information to define local contamination monitoring, emergence of COVID-19 and its variants and many other aspects to cope with and control the pandemic. WBE surveillance, however, requires several consecutive steps such as sampling, pretreatment and concentration of samples, and detection and quantification of SARS-CoV-2 genetic material in wastewater. In this review paper, the literature regarding to all these applications reviewed considering their advantages, disadvantages as well as their applicability. A specific emphasis was placed on the last step, detection and quantification since it covers the most critical procedure for concentrating the virus before measurement. Evaluation of the existing data indicating ultrafiltration, polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation and electronegative membrane filtration (ENMF) were the most promising techniques for concentration. The ongoing studies are proposed to be continued within the context of standard methods. Future research needs are delineated and suggestions are made for details.","Kabdaşlı, Işık; Tünay, Olcay",J Environ Chem Eng,318,16

Despite its severity and prevalence, treatment options are limited. In light of accumulating evidence that mitochondrial abnormalities are common in ARF, here we applied broad spectrum quantitative and semiquantitative metabolomic analyses of serum from ARF patients to detect bioenergetic dysfunction and determine its association with survival. Plasma samples from surviving and non-surviving patients (N = 15/group) were taken at day 1 and day 3 after admission to the medical intensive care unit and, in survivors, at hospital discharge. Significant differences between survivors and non-survivors (ANOVA, 5% FDR) include bioenergetically relevant intermediates of redox cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and NAD phosphate (NADP), increased acyl-carnitines, bile acids, and decreased acyl-glycerophosphocholines. Many metabolites associated with poor outcomes are substrates of NAD(P)-dependent enzymatic processes, while alterations in NAD cofactors rely on bioavailability of dietary B-vitamins thiamine, riboflavin and pyridoxine. Changes in the efficiency of the nicotinamide-derived cofactors’ biosynthetic pathways also associate with alterations in glutathione-dependent drug metabolism characterized by substantial differences observed in the acetaminophen metabolome. Based on these findings, a four-feature model developed with semi-quantitative and quantitative metabolomic results predicted patient outcomes with high accuracy (AUROC = 0.91). Collectively, this metabolomic endotype points to a close association between mitochondrial and bioenergetic dysfunction and mortality in human ARF, thus pointing to new pharmacologic targets to reduce mortality in this condition.","Langley, Raymond J.; Migaud, Marie E.; Flores, Lori; Thompson, J.

All strains hemagglutinated both mouse and chicken erythrocytes at 4 °C, but the ratios of hemagglutination titers with mouse erythrocytes compared to chicken erythrocytes showed diversity for both CD and WD strains. Some CD and WD strains did not hemagglutinate chicken erythrocytes at 37 °C and showed receptor-destroying enzyme activity against chicken erythrocytes. Hyperimmune antisera were produced in guinea pigs against 3 and 7 strains of BCV from CD and WD, respectively. No significant differences in antibody titers against these strains were observed by indirect immunofluorescence tests. However, in virus neutralization tests, antisera to 1 CD and 2 WD strains had 16-fold or lower antibody titers against 3 WD and 1 CD strains than against the homologous strains, and this variation reflected low antigenic relatedness values (R=13–25%), suggesting the presence of different subtypes among BCV. In hemagglutination inhibition tests, some one-way antigenic variations among strains were also observed. These results suggest that some antigenic and biological diversity exists among BCV strains, but these variations were unrelated to the clinical source of the strains; i.e. CD or WD.","Tsunemitsu, H.; Saif, L.

The hematopoietic system plays a critical role in the observed hyperinflammation, particularly in severely ill patients. We conducted a prospective diagnostic study performing a blood differential analyzing morphologic changes in peripheral blood of COVID‐19 patients. COVID‐19 associated morphologic changes were defined in a training cohort and subsequently validated in a second cohort (n = 45). Morphologic aberrations were further analyzed by electron microscopy (EM) and flow cytometry of lymphocytes was performed. We included 45 COVID‐19 patients in our study (median age 58 years; 82% on intensive care unit). The blood differential showed a specific pattern of pronounced multi‐lineage aberrations in lymphocytes (80%) and monocytes (91%) of patients. Overall, 84%, 98%, and 98% exhibited aberrations in granulopoiesis, erythropoiesis, and thrombopoiesis, respectively. Electron microscopy revealed the ultrastructural equivalents of the observed changes and confirmed the multi‐lineage aberrations already seen by light microscopy.

METHODS: Data were taken from the Hamburg survey of homeless individuals (n = 100 individuals in the here used model, mean age 44.8 years, SD 12.5) focusing on homeless individuals in Hamburg, Germany. The number of physician visits in the past 3 months and hospitalization in the preceding 12 months were used as outcome measures. Drawing on the Andersen model of health care use as a conceptual framework, predisposing characteristics, enabling resources and need factors as well as psychosocial variables were included as correlates. RESULTS: Negative binomial regressions showed that increased physician visits were associated with being female (IRR: 4.02 [95% CI: 1.60–10.11]), absence of chronic alcohol consume (IRR: 0.26 [95% CI: 0.12–0.57]) and lower health-related quality of life (IRR: 0.97 [95% CI: 0.96–0.98]). Furthermore, logistic regressions showed that the likelihood of hospitalization was positively associated with lower age (OR: 0.93 [95% CI: 0.89–0.98]), having health insurance (OR: 8.11 [2.11–30.80]) and lower health-related quality of life (OR: 0.97 [95% CI: 0.94–0.99]). CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that predisposing characteristics (both age and sex), enabling resources (i.e., health insurance) and need factors in terms of health-related quality of life are main drivers of health care use among homeless individuals.

As noted in other states, an unintended consequence of these activities was significant declines in childhood immunizations. After analyzing state-wide immunization register data for Texas, we observed a 47% relative decline in immunization rates between 2019 and 2020 among 5-month-olds and a 58% decline among 16-month-olds. We observed a small decline (5%) among 24-month-olds, and no decline in vaccines received at birth (Hepatitis B). Declines were larger in rural counties compared to urban. These declines are superimposed on increases in state vaccine exemptions over the last five years due to an aggressive anti-vaccine movement in Texas.

However, little is known regarding whether pooling of samples accurately detects SARS-CoV-2. To validate the feasibility of pooling samples, serial dilution analysis and spike-in experiments were conducted using synthetic DNA and nucleic acids extracted from SARS-CoV-2-positive and -negative patients. Furthermore, we studied 1000 individuals, 667 of whom were “healthy” individuals (195 healthcare workers and 472 hospitalized patients with disorders other than COVID-19 infection), and 333 infection-suspected patients with cough and fever. Serial dilution analysis showed a limit of detection of around 10–100 viral genome copies according to the protocol of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases, Japan. Spike-in experiments demonstrated that RT-qPCR detected positive signals in pooled samples with SARS-CoV-2-negative and -positive patients at 5-, 10-, 20-fold dilutions. By screening with this pooling strategy, by the end of April 2020 there were 12 SARS-CoV-2-positive patients in 333 infection-suspected patients (3.6%) and zero in 667 “healthy” controls.

Alpha‐1‐antitrypsin (A1AT) is a constitutive tissue protector with antiviral and anti‐inflammatory properties. A1AT inhibits SARS‐CoV‐2 infection and two of the most important proteases in the pathophysiology of Covid‐19: the transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) and the disintegrin and metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17). It also inhibits the activity of inflammatory molecules, such as IL‐8, TNF‐α, and neutrophil elastase (NE). TMPRSS2 is essential for SARS‐CoV‐2‐S protein priming and viral infection. ADAM17 mediates ACE2, IL‐6R, and TNF‐α shedding. ACE2 is the SARS‐CoV‐2 entry receptor and a key component for the balance of the renin‐angiotensin system, inflammation, vascular permeability, and pulmonary homeostasis. In addition, clinical findings indicate that A1AT levels might be important in defining Covid‐19 outcomes, potentially partially explaining associations with air pollution and with diabetes. In this review, we focused on the interplay between A1AT with TMPRSS2, ADAM17 and immune molecules, and the role of A1AT in the pathophysiology of Covid‐19, opening new avenues for investigating effective treatments.","de Loyola, Mariana Braccialli; dos Reis, Thaís Tereza Aguiar; de Oliveira, Guilherme Xavier Lyra Malcher; da Fonseca Palmeira, Julys; Argañaraz, Gustavo A.; Argañaraz, Enrique R.",Rev Med Virol,318,20

The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed over 350,000 human lives within five months of its emergence, especially in the USA and the European continent. This study analysed the implications of the genetic diversity and mutations in SARS-CoV-2 on its virulence diversity and investigated how these factors could affect the successful development and application of antiviral chemotherapy, immunotherapy, serodiagnosis, and vaccination. Methods All the suitable and eligible full text articles published between 31st December 2019 and 31st May 2020 were filtered and extracted from “PubMed”, “Scopus”, “Web of Science”, and “Hinari” and were critically reviewed. We used the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms “COVID-19, “Mutation”, “Genetic diversity”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “Virulence”, “Pathogenicity”, “Evolution” and “SARS-CoV-2 transmission” for this search. Results Our search showed that SARS-CoV-2 has persistently undergone significant mutations in various parts of its non-structural proteins (NSPs), including NSP2 and NSP3, S protein, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). In particular, the S protein was found to be the key determinant of evolution, transmission, and virulence of SARS-CoV-2, and could be a potential target for vaccine development. Additionally, RdRp could be a major target in the development of antivirals for the treatment of COVID-19. Conclusion Given the critical importance of mutations in the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 and in the development of sero-diagnostics, antivirals, and vaccines, this study recommends continuous molecular surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. This approach would potentially prompt identification of new mutants and their impact on ongoing biomedical interventions and COVID-19 control measures.","Abdullahi, Idris Nasir; Emeribe, Anthony Uchenna; Ajayi, Onaoluwa Abimbola; Oderinde, Bamidele Soji; Amadu, Dele Ohinoyi; Osuji, Ahaneku Iherue",J Taibah Univ Med Sci,318,12

ACE2 is part of the renin–angiotensin system (RAS) and acts as a feedback control system moderating blood pressure, keeping blood pressure within normal limits. For a virus to infect a person, the virus has to get inside the person’s cells. The virus that causes COVID-19 uses ACE2 to get into the cell. Think of this like an invader from outer space attacking your car by getting in through your cruise control; the RAS is like the cruise control of your car. What happens next depends on how robust your cruise control is. If your cruise control is young and healthy perhaps very little happens; your car may slow down or speed up a bit. But if your cruise control is in poor condition the attack might disrupt the entire speed control system; your car may brake suddenly or speed out of control and crash. Feedback control systems (natural or man-made) are designed to keep dynamic systems in control, but under certain situations can drive the system completely out of control. The RAS is composed of two feedback loops: the ACE loop provides amplification, increasing pro-inflammatory cytokines and blood pressure; the ACE2 loop provides fine control and mitigates the vasoconstrictive, pro-inflammatory, and thrombotic actions of the ACE loop. Usually, there is balance, but in the setting of COVID-19, underlying deficiencies of zinc and ACE2 can lead to an imbalance. Exacerbated by the severe downregulation of ACE2 seen with viral entry, a “tipping point” is reached with loss of control of the RAS system resulting in increased angiotensin II (Ang II) causing downstream vasoconstriction, inflammation, and thromboses. These, in turn, lead to complications often seen in “severe COVID-19” such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or cytokine storm, often seen in high-risk patients in the second week of illness. This model suggests that supplemental zinc could replenish zinc in ACE2, stabilize the ACE2 axis, and prevent disruption of the RAS. This would prevent the vasoconstrictive, inflammatory, and thrombotic actions of Ang II, thus preventing the severe COVID-19 complications which cause the high morbidity and mortality seen in high-risk patients with underlying zinc deficiency. Zinc supplements are available, easy to use, and relatively safe. Randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm safety and efficacy of zinc supplementation to decrease severity of and morality from COVID-19 in high-risk patients. Since replenishment of zinc and active ACE2 in patients in whom these are deficient may take weeks, supplementation in high-risk populations prior to COVID infection may be required. Such supplementation should not replace vaccination but may be useful in populations for whom vaccination is not available or for populations exposed to viral variants to which available vaccines have insufficient coverage.","Salgo, Miklos P.",Infect Dis Ther,318,20

This structure reflects higher transmission risks among household members than among non-household members. We explore strategic implementation choices that make use of household structure, and investigate strategies including two-step tracing, backwards tracing, smartphone tracing and tracing upon symptom report rather than test results. The primary model outcome is the effect of contact tracing, in combination with different levels of physical distancing, on the growth rate of the epidemic. Furthermore, we investigate epidemic extinction times to indicate the time period over which interventions must be sustained. We consider effects of non-uptake of isolation/quarantine, non-adherence, and declining recall of contacts over time. Our results find that, compared to self-isolation of cases without contact tracing, a contact tracing strategy designed to take advantage of household structure allows for some relaxation of physical distancing measures but cannot completely control the epidemic absent of other measures. Even assuming no imported cases and sustainment of moderate physical distancing, testing and tracing efforts, the time to bring the epidemic to extinction could be in the order of months to years.

Little information is known regarding the risks and outcomes of cosmetic tourism, in particular, for aesthetic breast surgery. The majority of the literature involves retrospective case series with no defined comparator. We aimed to amalgamate the published data to date to ascertain the risks involved and the outcomes of cosmetic tourism for aesthetic breast surgery on a global basis. METHODS: A systematic review of PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, the Cochrane library and OVID Medline was conducted using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines. Keywords such as “medical tourism”, “cosmetic tourism”, “tourism”, “tourist”, “surgery”, “breast” and “outcomes” were used. Seven hundred and seventy-one titles were screened, and 86 abstracts were reviewed leaving 35 full texts. Twenty-four of these met the inclusion criteria and were used to extract data for this systematic review. RESULTS: One hundred and seventy-one patients partook in cosmetic tourism for aesthetic breast surgery. Forty-nine percent of patients had an implant-based procedure. Other procedures included: mastopexy (n=4), bilateral breast reduction (n=11) and silicone injections (n=2). Two-hundred and twenty-two complications were recorded, common complications included: wound infection in 39% (n=67), breast abscess/ collection in 12% (n=21), wound dehiscence in 12% (n= 20) and ruptured implant in 8% (n=13). Clavien–Dindo classification of the complications includes 88 (51%) IIIb complications with 103 returns to theatre, 2 class IV complications (ICU stay) and one class V death of a patient. Explantation occurred in 39% (n=32) of implant-based augmentation patients. CONCLUSIONS: Aesthetic breast surgery tourism is popular within the cosmetic tourism industry. However, with infective complications (39%) and return to theatre rates (51%) significantly higher than expected, it is clear that having these procedures abroad significantly increases the risks involved. The high complication rate not only impacts individual patients, but also the home country healthcare systems. Professional bodies for cosmetic surgery in each country must highlight and educate patients how to lower this risk if they do choose to have cosmetic surgery abroad. In this current era of an intra-pandemic world where health care is already stretched, the burden from cosmetic tourism complications must be minimised.

In December 2019, just before the pandemic, we were awarded a grant to conduct a randomised controlled trial, the Should I Take Aspirin? (SITA) trial, in Victoria, the Australian state most heavily affected by COVID-19 during 2020. MAIN BODY: We originally modelled the SITA trial recruitment method on previous trials where participants were approached and recruited in general practice waiting rooms. COVID-19 changed the way general practices worked, with a significant increase in telehealth consultations and restrictions on in person waiting room attendance. This prompted us to adapt our recruitment methods to this new environment to reduce potential risk to participants and staff, whilst minimising any recruitment bias. We designed a novel teletrial model, which involved calling participants prior to their general practitioner appointments to check their eligibility. We delivered the trial both virtually and face-to-face with similar overall recruitment rates to our previous studies.

Detailed line-list data with household settings can advance the understanding of COVID-19 transmission dynamics. METHODS: A unique database with detailed demographic characteristics, travel history, social relationships, and epidemiological timelines for 1,407 transmission pairs that formed 643 transmission clusters in mainland China was reconstructed from 9,120 COVID-19 confirmed cases reported during January 15 - February 29, 2020. Statistical model fittings were used to identify the super-spreaders and estimate serial interval distributions. Age and gender-stratified hazard of infection were estimated for household versus non-household transmissions. RESULTS: There were 34 primary cases identified as super-spreaders, with 5 super-spreading events occurred within households. Mean and standard deviation of serial intervals were estimated as 5.0 (95% CrI: 4.4, 5.5) and 5.2 (95% CrI: 4.9, 5.7) days for household transmissions and 5.2 (95% CrI: 4.6, 5.8) and 5.3 (95% CrI: 4.9, 5.7) days for non-household transmissions, respectively. Hazard of being infected outside of households is higher for age between 18 and 64 years, whereas hazard of being infected within households is higher for young and old people. CONCLUSIONS: Non-negligible frequency of super-spreading events, short serial intervals, and a higher risk of being infected outside of households for male people of working age indicate a significant barrier to the identification and management of COVID-19 cases, which requires enhanced non-pharmaceutical interventions to mitigate this pandemic.","Xu, Xiao-Ke; Liu, Xiao-Fan; Wu, Ye; Ali, Sheikh Taslim; Du, Zhanwei; Bosetti, Paolo; Lau, Eric H Y; Cowling, Benjamin J; Wang, Lin",Clin Infect Dis,318,1

Coronavirus infections in humans are typically associated with respiratory illnesses; however, viral RNA has been isolated in serum from infected patients. Coronaviruses have been identified as a potential low‐risk threat to blood safety. The Mirasol Pathogen Reduction Technology (PRT) System utilizes riboflavin and ultraviolet (UV) light to render blood‐borne pathogens noninfectious, while maintaining blood product quality. Here, we report on the efficacy of riboflavin and UV light against the pandemic virus SARS‐CoV‐2 when tested in both plasma and platelets units. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Stock SARS‐CoV‐2 was grown in Vero cells and inoculated into either plasma or platelet units. Those units were then treated with riboflavin and UV light. The infectious titres of SARS‐CoV‐2 were determined by plaque assay using Vero cells. A total of five (n = 5) plasma and three (n = 3) platelet products were evaluated in this study. RESULTS: In both experiments, the measured titre of SARS‐CoV‐2 was below the limit of detection following treatment with riboflavin and UV light. The mean log reductions in the viral titres were ≥3·40 and ≥4·53 for the plasma units and platelet units, respectively. CONCLUSION: Riboflavin and UV light effectively reduced the titre of SARS‐CoV‐2 in both plasma and platelet products to below the limit of detection in tissue culture. The data suggest that the process would be effective in reducing the theoretical risk of transfusion transmitted SARS‐CoV‐2.","Keil, Shawn D.; Ragan, Izabela; Yonemura, Susan; Hartson, Lindsay; Dart, Nicole K.; Bowen, Richard",Vox Sang,318,24

METHODS: From August through December 2009, 964 symptomatic adult outpatients were included. RT-PCR was used to detect the following pathogens: influenza A (H1N1) and B, parainfluenza 1–4, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, human coronavirus (OC43, 229E, NL63), Chlamydia pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella species. The Dutch GHOR, American CDC and WHO, and British HPA case definitions were evaluated. RESULTS: A respiratory pathogen was detected in 41% of tested patient samples; influenza A (H1N1) and human rhinovirus were both detected in 16%. Clinical presentation of influenza cases was significantly more serious when compared to rhinovirus or negative-tested cases. Test characteristics were almost similar for all 4 case definitions, with an average sensitivity of 66%, specificity of 70%, positive predictive value of 34% and negative predictive value of 90%.

METHODS: Preoperative patients had one or two nasopharyngeal swabs, depending on low or high risk of viral transmission. Positive tests were repeated. RESULTS: Forty‐three of 52 patients required two or more preoperative tests. Four (9.3%) had discrepant results (positive/negative). One of these left the coronavirus disease (COVID) unit against medical advice despite an orbital abscess, with unknown true disease status. The remaining 3 of 42 (7.1%) had negative repeat RT‐PCR. Although ultimately considered falsepositives, one was sent to a COVID unit postoperatively and two had urgent surgery delayed. Assuming negative repeat RT‐PCR, clear chest imaging, and lack of subsequent symptoms represent the “gold standard,” RT‐PCR specificity was 0.97. CONCLUSIONS: If false positives are suspected, we recommend computed tomography (CT) of the chest and repeat RT‐PCR.

Although predominantly a pandemic of acute respiratory disease, corona virus infectious disease-19 (COVID-19) results in multi-organ damage that impairs cardiopulmonary (CP) function and reduces cardiorespiratory fitness. Superimposed on the CP consequences of COVID-19 is a marked reduction in physical activity that exacerbates CP disease (CPD) risk. CP exercise testing (CPET) is routinely used in clinical practice to diagnose CPD and assess prognosis; assess cardiovascular safety for rehabilitation; and delineate the physiological contributors to exercise intolerance and exertional fatigue. As such, CPET plays an important role in clinical assessments of convalescent COVID-19 patients as well as research aimed at understanding the long-term health effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, due to the ventilatory expired gas analysis involved with CPET, the procedure is considered an aerosol generating procedure. Therefore, extra precautions should be taken by health care providers and exercise physiologists performing these tests. This paper provides recommendations for CPET testing during the COVID-19 pandemic. These recommendations include indications for CPET; pre-screening assessments; precautions required for testing; and suggested decontamination protocols. These safety recommendations are aimed at preventing SARS-CoV-2 transmission during CPET.","Mihalick, Virginia L.; Canada, Justin M.; Arena, Ross; Abbate, Antonio; Kirkman, Danielle L.",Prog Cardiovasc Dis,318,16

Surgical indication of tracheostomy is greatly affected by the general condition of the patient, comorbidity, prognosis, hospital resources, and staff experience. Thus, the optimal timing of tracheostomy remains controversial. METHODS: : We reviewed our early experience with COVID-19 patients who underwent tracheostomy at one tertiary hospital in Japan from February to September 2020and analyzed the timing of tracheostomy, operative results, and occupational infection in healthcare workers (HCWs). RESULTS: : Of 16 patients received tracheal intubation with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, five patients (31%) received surgical tracheostomy in our hospital. The average consultation time for surgical tracheostomy was 7.4 days (range, 6 - 9 days) from the COVID-19 team to the otolaryngologist. The duration from tracheal intubation to tracheostomy ranged from 14 to 27 days (average, 20 days). The average time of tracheostomy was 27 min (range, 17 - 39 min), and post-wound bleeding occurred in only one patient. No significant differences in hemoglobin (Hb) levels were found between the pre- and postoperative periods (mean: 10.2 vs. 10.2 g/dl, p = 0.93). Similarly, no difference was found in white blood cell (WBC) count (mean: 12,200 vs. 9,900 cells /μl, p = 0.25). After the tracheostomy, there was no occupational infection among the HCWs who assisted the tracheostomy patients during the perioperative period. CONCLUSION: : We proposed a modified weaning protocol and surgical indications of tracheostomy for COVID-19 patients and recommend that an optimal timing for tracheostomy in COVID-19 patients of 2 - 3 weeks after tracheal intubation, from our early experiences in Japan. An experienced multi-disciplinary tracheostomy team is essential to perform a safe tracheostomy in patients with COVID-19 and to minimize the risk of occupational infection in HCWs.","Nishio, Naoki; Hiramatsu, Mariko; Goto, Yukari; Shindo, Yuichiro; Yamamoto, Takanori; Jingushi, Naruhiro; Wakahara, Keiko; Sone, Michihiko",Auris Nasus Larynx,318,1

The aim was to examine demographic and clinical factors associated with COVID-19 hospitalisation status in people with rheumatic disease. METHODS: Case series of individuals with rheumatic disease and COVID-19 from the COVID-19 Global Rheumatology Alliance registry: 24 March 2020 to 20 April 2020. Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate ORs and 95% CIs of hospitalisation. Age, sex, smoking status, rheumatic disease diagnosis, comorbidities and rheumatic disease medications taken immediately prior to infection were analysed. RESULTS: A total of 600 cases from 40 countries were included. Nearly half of the cases were hospitalised (277, 46%) and 55 (9%) died. In multivariable-adjusted models, prednisone dose ≥10 mg/day was associated with higher odds of hospitalisation (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.06 to 3.96). Use of conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) alone or in combination with biologics/Janus Kinase inhibitors was not associated with hospitalisation (OR 1.23, 95% CI 0.70 to 2.17 and OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.46, respectively). Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use was not associated with hospitalisation status (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.06).

RNA and related retro viruses represent a large and diverse family that contribute to the onset of human diseases such as AIDS; certain cancers like T cell lymphoma; severe acute respiratory illnesses as seen with COVID-19; and others. The hallmark of this viral family is the storage of genetic material in the form of RNA, and upon infecting host cells, their RNA genomes reprogram the cellular environment to favor productive viral replication. RNA is a multifunctional biomolecule that not only stores and transmits heritable information, but it also has the capacity to catalyze complex biochemical reactions. It is therefore no surprise that RNA viruses use this functional diversity to their advantage to sustain chronic or lifelong infections. Efforts to subvert RNA viruses therefore requires a deep understanding of the mechanisms by which these pathogens usurp cellular machinery. Here, we briefly summarize several experimental techniques that individually inform on key physicochemical features of viral RNA genomes and their interactions with proteins. Each of these techniques provide important vantage points to understand the complexities of virus-host interactions, but we attempt to make the case that by integrating these and similar methods, more vivid descriptions of how viruses reprogram the cellular environment emerges. These vivid descriptions should expedite the identification of novel therapeutic targets.","Haddad, Christina; Davila-Calderon, Jesse; Tolbert, Blanton S.",Methods,318,19

SETTING: Beni, Butembo and Katwa health zones in the Democratic Republic of Congo. PARTICIPANTS: The sample contained 223 Ebola survivors, 102 sexual partners and 74 comparison respondents living in the same areas of the survivors. Survivors were eligible if aged >18 years with confirmed Ebola-free status. The comparison group was neither a survivor nor a partner of a survivor and did not have any household members who contracted Ebola virus disease (EVD). PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Health and mental health characteristics, barriers to care and the association of association of mental health disorders with study population characteristics. RESULTS: Funding was a barrier to accessing needed health services among all groups. Nearly one-third (28.4%, 95% CI 18.0% to 38.7%) of comparison households avoided getting injections for their children. Although most pregnant women were attending antenatal care, less than 40% of respondents stated EVD precautions were discussed at those visits. Trouble sleeping and anger were the strongest predictors of post-traumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety and suicide attempts with 3-fold to 16-fold increases in the odds of these disorders. There was a 71% decrease in the odds of MDD if current substance abuse (aOR 0.29; 95% CI 0.13 to 0.67; p<0.01) was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Specialised mental health services were limited. Fear of contracting EVD influenced vaccine compliance. Anger and sleep disorders significantly increased the odds of mental health disorders across all groups. Respondents may be using substance abuse as self-medication for MDD. Ebola outbreak areas would benefit from improved screening of mental health disorders and associated conditions like anger and sleep difficulties and improved mental health services that include substance abuse prevention and treatment.","Lawry, Lynn Lieberman; Stroupe Kannappan, Nancy; Canteli, Covadonga; Clemmer, William",BMJ Open,318,16

Following a comprehensive internal root-cause investigation, it was hypothesized that prior prime-boost immunization of ferrets with a commercial canine C3 vaccine to protect against the canine distemper virus had resulted in primary immune response to fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the C3 preparation. Upon intranasal exposure to SARS-CoV-2 virus cultured in medium containing FBS, an allergic airway response occurred in 6 out of 56 of the ferrets. The 6 impacted ferrets were randomly dispersed across study groups, including different COVID-19 vaccine candidates, routes of vaccine candidate administration, and controls (placebo). The root-cause investigation and subsequent analysis determined that the allergic reaction was unrelated to the COVID-19 vaccine candidates under evaluation. Histological assessment suggested that the allergic response was characterized by eosinophilic airway disease; increased serum immunoglobulin levels reactive to FBS further suggested this response was caused by immune priming to FBS present in the C3 vaccine. This was further supported by in vivo studies demonstrating ferrets administered diluted FBS also presented clinical signs consistent with a hyperallergic response, while clinical signs were absent in ferrets that received a serum-free SARS-CoV-2 inoculum. It is therefore recommended that vaccine studies in higher order animals should consider the impact of welfare vaccination and use serum-free inoculum whenever possible.","Layton, Daniel; Burkett, Kathie; Marsh, Glenn A; Singanallur, Nagendrakumar B; Barr, Jennifer; Layton, Rachel; Riddell, Sarah-Jane; Brown, Sheree; Trinidad, Lee; Au, Gough G; McAuley, Alexander J; Lowther, Suzanne; Watson, James; Vasan, Seshadri S",ILAR J,318,26

Our objective was to elaborate a protocol to make ECT during the COVID-19 pandemic a safer procedure for patients and professionals. METHODS: A multidisciplinary workgroup (including mental health, anesthesia, preventive medicine, and occupational risk professionals) was formed in the Hospital Clínic de Barcelona, in March 2020. A core group conducted a review of the scientific literature and healthcare organizations’ guidelines and wrote a protocol draft. Then, a discussion with the workgroup was made until consensus was reached. The protocol has been continuously updated. Discussions were made by group e-mailing and video conferencing. RESULTS: The protocol includes the following main areas: 1) ECT unit's structural and functional; 2) SARS-CoV-2 screening protocol; 3) ECT clinical practice adaptation (personal protective equipment, airway management, recovery room, and maintenance of the facilities); 4) management of COVID-19 cases; and 5) protocol assessment. LIMITATIONS: The literature review was not systematic; the consensus was not based on a structured methodology. For other ECT units, local advisories may not be valid, and resource shortages (such as anesthetist availability, or the lack of respirators and PCR tests) may impede or prevent their implementation.

While the role of glucose control has been emphasized to improve the prognosis, the impact of different glucose-lowering agents remains largely unknown. Metformin remains the first-line pharmacological choice for the management of hyperglycaemia in T2DM. Because metformin exerts various effects beyond its glucose-lowering action, among which are anti-inflammatory effects, it may be speculated that this biguanide might positively influence the prognosis of patients with T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19. The present concise review summarizes the available data from observational retrospective studies that have shown a reduction in mortality in metformin users compared with non-users, and briefly discusses the potential underlying mechanisms that might perhaps explain this favourable impact. However, given the potential confounders inherently found in observational studies, caution is required before drawing any firm conclusions in the absence of randomized controlled trials.","Scheen, André J.",Diabetes Metab,318,16

Recent publications suggested the benefit of utilizing convalescent plasma from recovered donors as a therapeutic approach in treating COVID-19 patients. Convalescent plasma could provide our first-line defense for people with COVID-19, especially those who are older and at a much higher risk for complications., therefore, we developed a national protocol to investigate the safety, benefit and applicability at larger scale and at different health care facilities in Saudi Arabia (KSA). Objectives Primary endpoints are 1. ICU (or designated area for critical patients) length of stay 2. Safety of convalescent plasma> Secondary endpoints included: 1. 30 days mortality 2. Number of days on mechanical ventilation 3. Days to clinical recovery Method Eligible convalescent plasma donors will be invited to participate in trial. The arrangement for plasmapheresis will start after obtaining donor informed consent. The collected plasma will be treated with pathogen reduction system. The convalescent plasma units will be labelled, stored and shipped as per the standard transfusion medicine protocols. It will be used only for eligible patients' “recipients” as per the following eligibility criteria: 1. Inclusion criteria: - Confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with POSITIVE rRT PCR test -18 or older -Must have been requiring ICU care or severe or immediately life-threatening care (any one of the following): 1. Patient requiring ICU care/admission. 2. Severe disease is defined as: a. Dyspnea b. Respiratory frequency ≥ 30/min c. Blood oxygen saturation ≤ 93% d. Partial pressure of arterial oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio < 300, and/or Lung infiltrates > 50% within 24 to 48 hours 3. Life-threatening disease is defined as: a. Respiratory failure b. Septic shock, and/or c.Multiple organ dysfunction or failure Exclusion criteria: 1. Negative or non-conclusive test COVID-19 rRT PCR test 2. Mild symptoms 3. Hospitalization not requiring ICU care/admission Eligible Patients will be infused with the convalescent plasma (200-400 ml / treatment dose)at least once & if possible, daily, for up to 5 sessions. Other supportive and therapeutic measures should continue according to the locally approved protocols with due diligence. Sample size was calculated with 80% power and 5% level of significance based on the recently published data to detect statistical difference in the study outcome. Therefore, we plan to recruit total of 575 patients. Convalescent plasma Recipient Group: 115 patients (recipients) who have COVID 19 as per the inclusion criteria. Comparative control Group: 460 Patients who are eitherCOVID 19 historical control or only consent for sharing their clinical and laboratory data Matching for age, gender, Hypertension, Diabetes and intubation status were done based on the propensity score. Continuous variables will be presented as the median and interquartile range (IQR). Statistical software SPSS 24.0 will be used. Demographic, Clinical, imaging and laboratory information of all enrolled patients will be retrieved from the hospital electronic/paper records system to be used for the outcomes analysis. Results 22 sites across KSA that participated in the study. Tertiary, secondary, academic and non-academic centers participated (real world data). There were no unusual safety issues related to convalescent plasma infusion since all mortalities in the plasma group were not related to plasma infusion which represent similar finding from other the published international reports. Keeping in-mind that our data is still maturing, 30 survival probability in the plasma group was 69% compared to 56% in the comparative group (p value = 0.066) (figure-1). This benefit to seem to be more noticeable in the COVID-19 cases who did not meet the criteria for life-threatening disease (figure-2). Conclusion Our study supports the safety of convalescent plasma in treating COVID-19 patients. Patients who are in the category of life-threating/end organs failure do not seem to benefit. There might be a benefit in the other subgroups.

This report describes the first multicenter retrospective comparison of the performance of the QIAstat-Dx RP assay to the established ePlex Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP) assay, for which we used 287 respiratory samples from patients suspected with respiratory infections. The QIAstat-Dx RP assay detected 312 (92%) of the 338 respiratory targets that were detected by the ePlex RPP assay. Most of the discrepant results have been observed in the low-pathogen-load samples. In addition, the QIAstat-Dx RP assay detected 19 additional targets in 19 respiratory samples that were not detected by the ePlex RPP assay. Nine of these discordant targets were considered to represent true positives after discrepancy testing by a third method. The main advantage of the QIAstat-Dx system compared to other syndromic testing systems, including the ePlex RPP assay, is the ability to generate cycle threshold (C(T)) values, which could help with the interpretation of results. Taking the data together, this study showed good performance of the QIAstat-Dx RP assay in comparison to the ePlex RPP assay for the detection of respiratory pathogens. The QIAstat-Dx RP assay offers a new, rapid, and accurate sample-to-answer multiplex panel for the detection of the most common viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens and therefore has the potential to direct appropriate therapy and infection control precautions.","Boers, Stefan A.; Melchers, Willem J.

This systematic review aims to synthesize the extant literature reporting on barriers of telemental health (TMH) during the COVID-19 pandemic and how facilities have worked to overcome these barriers, to inform best practices for TMH delivery. RECENT FINDINGS: Most recent findings came from case studies from mental health professionals which reported on barriers related to institutional, provider and patient factors, and how these barriers were overcome. Common barriers identified in the literature include: technological difficulties; issues regarding safety, privacy and confidentiality; therapeutic delivery and the patient-provider relationship; and a loss of sense of community. Studies also reported on the benefits to TMH interventions/tools, as well as suggestions for improvements in the delivery of TMH services. SUMMARY: As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, mental healthcare providers continue to find creative and feasible solutions to overcome barriers to the delivery of TMH. Dissemination of these solutions is imperative to ensure the best quality of mental healthcare for patients across the globe.","Siegel, Ashley; Zuo, Yushen; Moghaddamcharkari, Nika; McIntyre, Roger S.; Rosenblat, Joshua D.",Curr Opin Psychiatry,318,24

RECENT FINDINGS: In cardio-oncology, molecular and multimodality imaging studies confirm that sex differences do exist, affecting the therapeutic cardioprotective strategies and, therefore, the long-term outcomes. Interestingly, compelling evidences suggest that sex-specific characteristics in drug toxicity might predict differences in the therapeutic response, most likely due to the tangled interplay between cancer and HF, which probably share common underlying mechanisms. SUMMARY: Cardiovascular diseases show many sex-related differences in prevalence, etiology, phenotype expression, and outcomes. Complex molecular mechanisms underlie this diverse pathological manifestations, from sex-determined differential gene expression to sex hormone interaction with their receptors in the heart. Non-ischemic DCM is an umbrella definition that incorporates several etiologies, including chemotherapy-induced cardiomyopathies. The role of sex as a risk factor for cardiotoxicity is poorly explored. However, understanding the various features of disease manifestation and outcomes is of paramount importance for a prompt and tailored evaluation.","D’Amario, Domenico; Camilli, Massimiliano; Migliaro, Stefano; Canonico, Francesco; Galli, Mattia; Arcudi, Alessandra; Montone, Rocco Antonio; Borovac, Josip Andjelo; Crea, Filippo; Savarese, Gianluigi",Curr Cardiol Rep,318,16

In this case, intervening PTSD of medical staff and preparing them for future outbreaks are important. Previous studies showed that perceived stress was related to the development of PTSD. Hence, in this study, the association between risk perception of medical staff and PTSD symptoms in COVID-19 and the potential links were explored. Three hundred four medical staff's exposure to COVID-19 patients, risk perception for working during COVID-19, PTSD symptoms, anxiety, and sleep quality were measured. Mediation analysis tested the indirect effects of anxiety and sleep quality on the relationship between risk perceptions and PTSD symptoms; 27.6% of participants were deemed as having probable PTSD diagnosis. Mediation analysis showed a significant chain-mediating effect of anxiety and sleep quality on the relationships between risk perceptions and PTSD symptoms; higher risk perceptions were related to increased anxiety, worsened sleep quality, and severe PTSD symptoms. Conclusively, medical staff have a high prevalence of PTSD symptoms after 3 months of COVID-19. Their PTSD symptoms were associated with the perceived risk level through the potential links with anxiety and sleep quality. Therefore, risk perception could be critical for our medical staff's responses to public health emergencies. It could be plausible to intervene in the perceived stress to alleviate aroused anxiety and improve sleep quality and thereby deter the development of PTSD.","Yin, Qianlan; Chen, Aibin; Song, Xiangrui; Deng, Guanhui; Dong, Wei",Front Psychiatry,318,16

Herein, we show that “immature” F4/80(+)Ly‐6C(hi) monocytes are the first cells, along with neutrophils, to enter the MHV‐JHM‐infected central nervous system (CNS). As the infection progresses, macrophages in the CNS down‐regulate expression of Ly‐6C and CD62L, consistent with maturation, and a higher frequency express CD11c, a marker for dendritic cells (DCs). Microglia also express CD11c during this phase of the infection. CD11c(+) macrophages in the infected CNS exhibit variable properties of immature antigen‐presenting cells (APCs), with modestly increased CD40 and MHC expression, and equivalent potent antigen uptake when compared with CD11c(‐) macrophages. Furthermore, CDllc(+) and F4/80(+) macrophages and microglia are localized to areas of demyelination, in some instances directly associated with damaged axons. These results suggest that chronic CNS infection results in the appearance of CD11c‐expressing macrophages from the blood that exhibit properties of immature APCs, are closely associated with areas of demyelination, and may act as final effectors of myelin destruction.","Templeton, Steven P.; Kim, Taeg S.; O'Malley, Katherine; Perlman, Stanley",Brain Pathol,318,22

Global research on COVID-19 went ‘viral’ with a record 3487 research contributions comprising of 2062 journal papers and 1425 preprints published within the first three months following the outbreak of COVID-19. Surprisingly, the silence of the African research community has been unprecedented – contributing a paltry 0.6% (22 contributions), a figure nearly matched by Colombia (18 publications). Until now, a comprehensive perspective on the reasons for this subdued research response, and COVID-19 themes critical to Africa has been missing. We posit that while a milieu of factors accounts for this silence, unprecedented research opportunities exist to support COVID-19 decision and policy formulation in Africa. The subdued response reflects weak research systems, characterized by deep-rooted challenges, including severe lack of research expertise, funding, and infrastructure, coupled with poor working conditions. Hence, Africa's contribution to research on infectious diseases, including COVID-19, remains weak. Perceptions and attitudes among researchers and policy-makers on COVID-19, and the role of science in decision and policy-making also exist. Moreover, COVID-19 and earlier severe acute respiratory syndromes are considered as ‘imported diseases’ originating from outside Africa. Thus, notions may exist that the control methods will come from outside Africa through ‘technology-transfer’ or ‘capacity-building’. Yet local COVID-19 research is needed to address knowledge gaps, including; (1) potential novel transmission of SARS-CoV-2, (2) adaption of generic COVID-19 control measures to suit African settings, (3) occurrence and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in solid waste, wastewaters, on-site sanitation systems, and drinking water, and (4) the ‘human factor’ including the role of gender, perceptions, myths, attitudes, and religious beliefs in the transmission and control of COVID-19. Therefore, there is a need to: (1) strengthen local research capacity and evaluation systems, (2) consider biosafety and ethical issues, (3) initiate cross-disciplinary research and global collaboration on COVID-19, and (4) integrate science communication in COVID-19 programs.","Gwenzi, Willis; Rzymski, Piotr",Environ Res,318,16

We added a Q parameter to the classic SEIR compartmental model to include the effect of quarantine (Q-SEIR). The projections from the age-stratified probabilities give much lower predicted incidences of infection than the Q-SEIR model.

While recent studies have identified that there is an increase in structural injury to the nervous system in critically ill COVID-19 patients, there is little known about the relationship of COVID-19 neurological damage to the systemic inflammatory diseases also observed in COVID-19 patients. The purpose of this pilot observational study was to examine the relationships between serum neurofilament light protein (NfL, a measure of neuronal injury) and co-morbid cardiovascular disease (CVD) and neurological complications in COVID-19 positive patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). In this observational study of one-hundred patients who were admitted to the ICU in Tucson, Arizona between April and August 2020, 89 were positive for COVID-19 (COVID-pos) and 11 were COVID-negative (COVID-neg). A healthy control group (n=8) was examined for comparison. The primary outcomes and measures were subject demographics, serum NfL, presence and extent of CVD, diabetes, sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA), presence of neurological complications, and blood chemistry panel data. COVID-pos patients in the ICU had significantly higher mean levels of Nfl (229.6+163 pg/ml) compared to COVID-neg ICU patients (19.3+5.6 pg/ml), Welchs t-test, p =.01 and healthy controls (12.3+3.1 pg/ml), Welchs t-test p =.005. Levels of Nfl in COVID-pos ICU patients were significantly higher in patients with concomitant CVD and diabetes (n=35, log Nfl 1.6+.09), and correlated with higher SOFA scores (r=.5, p =.001). These findings suggest that in severe COVID-19 disease, the central neuronal and axonal damage in these patients may be driven, in part, by the level of systemic cardiovascular disease and peripheral inflammation. Understanding the contributions of systemic inflammatory disease to central neurological degeneration in these COVID-19 survivors will be important to the design of interventional therapies to prevent long-term neurological and cognitive dysfunction.","Hay, M.; Ryan, L.; Huentelman, M.; Konhilas, J.; Hoyer-Kimura, C.; Beach, T.

The Malaysian government has planned to procure COVID-19 vaccine through multiple agencies and companies in order to vaccinate at least 70% of the population. This study aimed to determine the knowledge, acceptance and perception of Malaysian adults regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. METHODOLOGY: An online survey was conducted for two weeks in December 2020. A bilingual, semi-structured questionnaire was set up using Google Forms and the generated link was shared on social media (i.e., Facebook and WhatsApp). The questionnaire consisted of questions on knowledge, acceptance and perception of COVID-19 vaccine. The association between demographic factors with scores on knowledge about COVID-19 vaccine were analysed using the Mann-Whitney test for two categorical variables, and the Kruskal-Wallis test used for more than two categorical variables. RESULTS: A total of 1406 respondents participated, with the mean age of 37.07 years (SD = 16.05) years, and among them 926 (65.9%) were female. Sixty two percent of respondents had poor knowledge about COVID-19 vaccine (mean knowledge score 4.65; SD = 2.32) and 64.5% were willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine. High knowledge scores associated with higher education background, higher-income category and living with who is at higher risk of getting severe COVID-19. They were more likely to be willing to get vaccinated if they were in a lower age group, have higher education levels and were female. CONCLUSION: Even though knowledge about vaccine COVID-19 is inadequate, the majority of the respondents were willing to get vaccinated. This finding can help the Ministry of Health plan for future efforts to increase vaccine uptake that may eventually lead to herd immunity against COVID-19.","Mohamed, Nurul Azmawati; Solehan, Hana Maizuliana; Mohd Rani, Mohd Dzulkhairi; Ithnin, Muslimah; Che Isahak, Che Ilina",PLoS One,318,33

We examined these reported behaviors among rural and urban community‐dwelling adults aged 65 and older. METHODS: We analyzed public use files from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, which fielded a COVID survey from June to October, 2020, restricted to community‐dwelling adults (n = 2,982). Eight behaviors were studied: handwashing, avoid touching face, mask wearing, limiting shopping, avoiding restaurants or bars, limiting gatherings, avoiding contact with those outside the household, and distancing. Residence was defined as urban (metropolitan county) or rural (nonmetropolitan county). Difference testing used Chi Square tests, with an alpha level of P = .05. Multivariable logistic regression was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios. RESULTS: Rural residents constituted 18.8% (± Standard Error 3.6%) of the study population. In bivariate comparisons, rural older adults were less likely to report 5 of 8 studied behaviors: keep 6‐foot distance (rural: 88.3% ±1.0%, urban 93.2% ±.08%), limit gatherings (rural 87.5% ±1.8%; urban 91.6% ±0.8%), avoid restaurants/bars (rural 85.3% ±1.9%, urban 89.6% ±0.8%), avoid touching face (rural 83.1% ±2.3%, urban 88.6%, 0.8%), and avoid contact with those outside the household (rural 80.4% ±2.4%, urban 86.2% ±1.0%). After adjusting for demographic characteristics, only maintaining a 6‐foot distance remained lower among rural older adults (AOR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.42‐0.81). CONCLUSIONS: Within older adults, reported compliance with recommended behaviors to limit the spread of COVID‐19 was high. Nonetheless, consistent rural shortfalls were noted. Findings highlight the need for rural‐specific messaging strategies for future public health emergencies.","Probst, Janice C.; Crouch, Elizabeth L.; Eberth, Jan M.",J Rural Health,318,24

Using an online survey, data were collected between late March and early April 2020. Participants were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk and included 747 adults living in the United States. Supporting our hypotheses, results indicated that both COVID-19-related worries and social isolation were significant mediators of the relationship between PVC and TS (Model 1). In addition, the results of a moderated mediation analysis indicated that the indirect effect of PVC on TS through COVID-19-related worries was stronger for participants who reported greater social isolation (Model 2). Although future research is needed, these findings suggest that both social isolation and disease-related worries may be important variables that can be targeted in interventions to reduce pandemic-related TS.","Boyraz, Güler; Legros, Dominique N.; Tigershtrom, Ashley",J Anxiety Disord,318,22

The effect was assessed quantitatively by review of key performance indicator data and qualitatively from staff feedback. RESULTS: A four-stage BCP was implemented. Stage 1 split teams into two, which rotated weekly, onsite (laboratory) and offsite (home). At 20 weeks post-implementation the BCP only progressed to stage 1 and the overall turnaround time was maintained. Staff experience indicated benefits from the review of workflow but noted some social impact associated with the change.

The patient complained of prolonged fever and coughs for 7 days which had not improved after oral treatment with sultamicillin for 5 days, prescribed by the patient’s general practitioner. Physical examination showed high blood pressure due to previously known hypertension. Other vital signs without pathological findings. Pulmonary auscultation showed basal soft crackling noises of the left lung Findings and Diagnosis Laboratory examination showed increased values for LDH, pro-BNP and CRP and normal values for leucocytes and procalcitonin. Conventional X-Ray of the chest showed bipulmonal lateral atypical infiltrates. After the first PCR turned in negative another PCR-analysis for SARS-CoV-2 of a deep oral swab-sample was performed since the clinical, laboratory and radiological findings were typical for COVID-19. Again, SARS-CoV-2-RNA was not detected. A CT-scan of the chest showed bipulmonal lateral ground-glass attenuation, again typical for COVID-19 associated pneumonia. After a third attempt for a PCR-analysis of a deep oral swab-sample was negative, analysis of a sputum was performed which finally confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. Therapy and Course of events The patient was admitted for evaluation of syncopes and suspect of COVID-19 associated pneumonia. The patient was prophylactically isolated while the result of SARS-CoV-2-PCR from a deep oral swab was pending. Suspecting a possible secondary bacterial infection at the beginning, intravenous antibiotic treatment with ampicillin/sulbactam was initiated. While further examinations showed no indication for bacterial infection, antibiotics were discontinued after 3 days. Due to clinical recovery antiviral therapy was not performed after confirming the diagnosis. The patient was discharged 17 days after onset of first symptoms without any requirements for further isolation. Conclusion This casuistic describes a case of COVID-19 associated pneumonia presenting with typical clinical features, laboratory and radiological findings. Detection of viral RNA was not successful from deep oral swab-samples despite repeated attempts. Finally, PCR-analysis of sputum confirmed the diagnosis. Analysis of deeper airway samples (sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, tracheal secretions) or stool for SARS-CoV-2 should be performed in cases of evident clinical suspicion of COVID-19 and negative PCR results from deep oral swabs.","Hornuss, Daniel; Laubner, Katharina; Monasterio, Carmen; Thimme, Robert; Wagner, Dirk",Dtsch Med Wochenschr,318,23

However, in many LMICs, traditional data sets on travel such as commuting surveys as well as non-traditional sources such as mobile phone data are lacking, or, where available, have only rarely been leveraged by the public health community. Evaluating the accuracy of available data to measure transmission-relevant travel may be further hampered by limited reporting of suspected and laboratory confirmed infections. Here, we leverage case data collected as part of a COVID-19 dashboard collated via daily reports from the Malagasy authorities on reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 across the 22 regions of Madagascar. We compare the order of the timing of when cases were reported with predictions from a SARS-CoV-2 metapopulation model of Madagascar informed using various measures of connectivity including a gravity model based on different measures of distance, Internal Migration Flow data, and mobile phone data. Overall, the models based on mobile phone connectivity and the gravity-based on Euclidean distance best predicted the observed spread. The ranks of the regions most remote from the capital were more difficult to predict but interestingly, regions where the mobile phone connectivity model was more accurate differed from those where the gravity model was most accurate. This suggests that there may be additional features of mobility or connectivity that were consistently underestimated using all approaches, but are epidemiologically relevant. This work highlights the importance of data availability and strengthening collaboration among different institutions with access to critical data - models are only as good as the data that they use, so building towards effective data-sharing pipelines is essential.","Ramiadantsoa, Tanjona; Metcalf, C.

A novel approach to large-scale estimation is proposed, taking advantage of the local structure of such models for the purpose of local computing. The main idea is that random graphs with local dependence can be decomposed into subgraphs, which enables parallel computing on subgraphs and suggests a two-step estimation approach. The first step estimates the local structure underlying random graphs. The second step estimates parameters given the estimated local structure of random graphs. Both steps can be implemented in parallel, which enables large-scale estimation. The advantages of the two-step estimation approach are demonstrated by simulation studies with up to 10,000 nodes and an application to a large Amazon product recommendation network with more than 10,000 products.","Babkin, Sergii; Stewart, Jonathan; Long, Xiaochen; Schweinberger, Michael",Comput Stat Data Anal,318,16

Among the etiological factors S. pneumoniae-causing lobar pneumonia plays a leading role. According to current textbook knowledge at least three sequential stages of lobar pneumonia are distinguished: congestion, red hepatization and gray hepatization. However, there are no detailed data supporting this stage concept. There are also controversial views on its etiology. In this study, the lung changes in lobar pneumonia were related to the cause and duration of the disease. In addition, the complications of the disease were evaluated. PCR studies verified the etiology of pneumonia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Lobar pneumonia was analyzed in 252 post mortem cases examined in a large hospital in Irkutsk. The pathology, etiology of pneumonia, course of disease and cause of death were recorded and correlated to its clinical course and duration. In the second part of the study, the results in 95 patients were analyzed in detail and related to PCR findings. RESULTS: Most patients were adult men of low social status who showed signs of severe alcoholism. Lobar pneumonia was observed in 85% of the patients, while the remaining patients showed sublobar (“lobular”, focal) lung involvement. Histologically, three patterns of inflammation were observed, which in most patients occurred concurrently in different parts of the involved lobe: “congestion”, characterized by serous exudation with multiple cocci (41% of cases), “red hepatization” (41% of cases) and “gray hepatization” (100% of cases). The latter pattern was subdivided into three subgroups according to the ratio of fibrin—neutrophils and the presence of macrophages. The mean number of different histological patterns observed per patient was 3.8. There was no correlation between the inflammatory patterns and the duration of the disease. In 23% of the patients, the cause of death was of pulmonary origin, while the remaining patients died of extrapulmonary complications (i.e. acute heart failure 26%, acute vascular insufficiency 15% purulent meningitis 11–24.3%. In 29/95 patients (20 with lobar and 9 with focal pneumonia) pneumococcal etiology of pneumonia was established by PCR. CONCLUSION: Lobar pneumonia is a distinct clinico-pathological entity caused by S. pneumoniae, demonstrated by PCR testing and/or cytological examinations. Bacteriologic studies frequently give falsenegative results. Lobar pneumonia is characterized by three main histopathological patterns (congestion or microbeous edema, and red and gray hepatization) which usually occur side by side and not in chronological order. Early death is often related to heart failure and septic shock, while meningitis is a frequent complication later in the course.","Zinserling, Vsevolod A.; Swistunov, Vladimir V.; Botvinkin, Alexander D.; Stepanenko, Lilia A.; Makarova, Angelica E.",Infection,318,24

Respondents were asked to note their top three stressors, from a list of ten commonly reported life stressors at three different time points. Results: The questionnaire was sent to 10,481 patients with 3,604 responses (response rate 34%) received. We included 2,202 non-pregnant, female respondents in the final analysis. One third of respondents had a prior diagnosis of an anxiety disorder and 11% reported taking anxiolytic medications; over one quarter had a prior diagnosis of a depressive disorder and 11% reported taking anti-depressant medications. At all three time points, infertility was noted to be the most frequent top stressor. Coronavirus was noted to be the third most common stressor amongst the respondents in early March but, currently, is similar to that of infertility (63% and 66% respectively). 6% of patients stated that infertility treatment, including IVF, should not be offered during the COVID-19 pandemic.

However, the mechanisms leading to the multi-tissue pathology are yet to be fully established. Although insights from SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV have been valuable, it is clear that SARS-CoV-2 is different and merits its own extensive studies.

Risk factors such as sex and exposure to pollutants are also explored followed by a discussion of ways in which bioengineering approaches can be employed to help understand COVID-19. The use of sophisticated in vitro models can be employed to interrogate intercellular interactions and also to tease apart effects of the virus itself from the resulting immune response. Additionally, spatiotemporal information can be gleaned from these models to learn more about the dynamics of the virus and COVID-19 progression. Application of advanced tissue and organ system models into COVID-19 research can result in more nuanced insight into the mechanisms underlying this condition and elucidate strategies to combat its effects.","Shirazi, Jasmine; Donzanti, Michael J.; Nelson, Katherine M.; Zurakowski, Ryan; Fromen, Catherine A.; Gleghorn, Jason P.",Cell Mol Bioeng,318,1

Even though multiple strategies are available for controlling infectious respiratory diseases, the current approach for managing this pandemic is the prevention of person-to-person transmission. Despite the quarantine strategy, some work positions must remain active, such as airport personnel. OBJECTIVES: To identify risk factors for COVID-19 transmission among workers at the El Dorado, Luis Carlos Galán Airport from March to July 2020. METHODS: This is a prospective cohort study with workers of the El Dorado International Airport, in Bogotá, Colombia. A sociodemographic questionnaire was for searching for symptoms associated with COVID-19 and other risk factors. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected for determining the presence of COVID-19. In order to identify seroconversion, we used an automated chemiluminescent immunoassay for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies. Patients with positive results were followed-up for 21 days. RESULTS: We observed an incidence of infection of 7.9%; most cases were asymptomatic. The main risk factor associated with infection was the duration of daily commute (relative risk 1.02 [95% confidence interval, 1.002-1.041]). CONCLUSIONS: We observed asymptomatic infection by COVID-19 among airport workers. Future research should contribute with knowledge for developing strategies that guarantee the protection of airport workers.","Malagón-Rojas, Jeadran N.; Mercado, Marcela; Gómez-Rendón, Claudia P.",Revista brasileira de medicina do trabalho : publicacao oficial da Associacao Nacional de Medicina do Trabalho-ANAMT,318,1

Five miRNAs (hsa-miR-15a-5p, hsa-miR-15b-5p, hsa-miR-195-5p, hsa-miR-16-5p, and hsa-miR-196a-1-3p) were found to commonly bind to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2. We also identified miRNAs that bind to receptor proteins, such as ACE2, ADAM17, and TMPRSS2, which are important for understanding the infection mechanism of SARS-CoV-2. The expression patterns of those miRNAs were examined in hamster lung samples infected by SARS-CoV-2. Five miRNAs (hsa-miR-15b-5p, hsa-miR-195-5p, hsa-miR-221-3p, hsa-miR-140-3p, and hsa-miR-422a) showed differential expression patterns in lung tissues before and after infection.

Prognostic factors and models may assist front-line clinicians in rapid identification of high-risk patients, early management of modifiable factors, appropriate triaging and optimising the use of limited healthcare resources. We aim to systematically assess the clinical, laboratory and imaging predictors as well as prediction models for severe or critical illness and mortality in patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: All peer-reviewed and preprint primary articles with a longitudinal design that focused on prognostic factors or models for critical illness and mortality related to COVID-19 will be eligible for inclusion. A systematic search of 11 databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang Data, SinoMed, bioRxiv, Arxiv and MedRxiv will be conducted. Study selection will follow the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Data extraction will be performed using the modified version of the Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies checklist and quality will be evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the Quality In Prognosis Studies tool. The association between prognostic factors and outcomes of interest will be synthesised and a meta-analysis will be conducted with three or more studies reporting a particular factor in a consistent manner.

It is important to clarify how to evaluate efficacy and safety of antiviral agents in treatment of COVID‐19 during the pandemic of this disease. We need to answer the following questions: do we still need to use rigorously designed randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs)? Or, will it be enough if we use loosened criteria, observational studies or even retrospective case series and case reports? The answer is “No, we still need to use the strictly designed preferably blinded multicenter RCTs to evaluate the antiviral agents.” In this article, we reviewed almost all the RCT reports on monotherapies and combined therapies with antiviral agents for COVID‐19, and found that among the reports on monotherapies, only remdesivir, and among combined antiviral agents, only the combined regimen with interferon‐β1b, lopinavir‐ritonavir and ribavirin were effective and safe based on evidences from RCTs. The results of five RCTs for chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine consistently showed that they were ineffective and unsafe in the treatment of COVID‐19, especially at larger doses. Many aspects in the design of the clinical trials may be related to success or failure of a trial and the relevant factors need to be analyzed, discussed and emphasized from the specific requirements and considerations of antiviral therapies. We hope such discussions be of certain use in designing clinical trials for pediatric antiviral therapies.","Zhaori, Getu; Lu, Lu; Liu, Chunyan; Guo, Yongli",Pediatr Investig,318,16

The aim of this study is to describe and analyze blood supply fluctuations and the use of convalescent plasma in 2020. METHODS: AABB distributed a weekly and biweekly questionnaire through email to hospital-based members (HBM). RESULTS: The survey was sent to 887 HBM with 479 unique respondents, most of the hospitals served pediatric and adult patients, and all states of the country participated, except Idaho and Vermont. Fifty four percent of HBM reported increased wastage in the early phase of the pandemic (May), which decreased to 4% by the end of June and throughout the rest of the year. The majority of HBM reported receiving alerts from their blood suppliers reporting blood shortages throughout the year. During March and April, only 12% of HBM were performing elective surgical procedures. The top reasons to delay procedures were: bed availability (28%); COVID-19 caseload (23%; and blood availability (19%). By mid-April, 42% HBM had transfused CCP and reported >24 h delay in getting the units; the vast majority obtained CCP using the Expanded Access Protocol, and later, the Emergency Use Authorization. HBM consistently prioritized the most severe patients to receive CCP, but the proportion of severely ill recipients fell from 52% to 37% between May and October, with an increase from 5% to 21% of HBM providing CCP transfusion early in the course of the disease. DISCUSSION: Blood utilization and availability fluctuated during the pandemic. The fluctuations appeared to be related to the number of COVID-19 in the community. The use and regulatory landscape of CCP rapidly evolved over the first 8 months of the pandemic.","Rajbhandary, Srijana; Shmookler, Aaron; Cohn, Claudia S; Nunes, Eduardo; Karafin, Matthew S; Stubbs, James; Pagano, Monica B",Transfusion,318,24

METHODS: A random, anonymous, cross-sectional telephone survey of 503 Hong Kong Chinese adults. RESULTS: The public in Hong Kong is likely to adopt self-protective behaviors (e.g., wearing face mask in public venues (73.8%), increasing the frequency of handwashing (86.7%)) and behaviors that protect others (e.g., wearing face masks when experiencing influenza-like illness (ILI, 92.4%), immediately seeking medical consultation (94.2%), making declarations when crossing the border with ILI (87.1%), complying to quarantine policies (88.3%)). Multivariate analyses indicated that factors related to age, full-time employment, perceived susceptibility, perceived efficacy of preventive measures, perceived higher fatality as compared to SARS, perceived chance of a major local outbreak, and being worried about self/family members contracting the virus were significantly associated with the inclination to adopt self-protective measures. Similar analyses showed that education level, variables related to perceived efficacy, perceived major local outbreak and such were significantly associated with various behaviors directed towards protecting others. CONCLUSION: In the event of a human-to-human H5N1 outbreak, the public in Hong Kong is likely to adopt preventive measures that may help contain the spread of the virus in the community.","Lau, Joseph TF; Kim, Jean H; Tsui, Hi Yi; Griffiths, Sian",BMC Infect Dis,318,31

Design, Setting, and Participants: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of health care workers from tertiary care and ministry of health Centers across the Central, Eastern, and Western regions of Saudi Arabia. There were 1,130 participants in the survey, and we collected demographic and mental health measurements from the participants. Primary Outcomes and Measures: The magnitude of symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia was measured using the original version of 9-item patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9), the 7-item generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7), and 7-item insomnia severity index (ISI). We use the multiple logistic regression analysis to identify the associated risk factors of individual outcomes. Results: The scores on the PHQ-9 showed that the largest proportion of health care workers (76.93%) experienced only normal to mild depression (50.83 and 26.1%, respectively). The scores on the GAD-7 showed that the largest proportion of health care workers (78.88%) experienced minimal to mild anxiety (50.41 and 28.47%, respectively). The scores on the ISI showed that the largest proportion of health care workers (85.83%) experienced absence to subthreshold insomnia (57.08 and 28.75%, respectively). The risk factors for depression in health care workers were Saudi, living with family, working from an isolated room at home and frontline worker. For anxiety, being female was risk factor and for insomnia, being frontline worker was risk factor. Conclusion: It was observed that the symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia were reported in a lower proportion of health care workers in our study. The participants who were female, frontline workers, Saudi, living with family, and working from home in isolated rooms were predisposed to developing psychological disorders.","Al Ammari, Maha; Sultana, Khizra; Thomas, Abin; Al Swaidan, Lolowa; Al Harthi, Nouf",Front Psychiatry,318,24

The causative organism was identified on the 7(th) of January 2020 as a novel coronavirus (nCoV or 2019-nCoV), later renamed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The resulting coronavirus (COVID-19) disease has infected over 37 57.8 million individuals, resulted in over 1 1.3 million deaths, and has led to an unprecedented impact on research activities worldwide. Extraordinary challenges have also been imposed upon medical and surgical trainees following re-deployment to full-time clinical duties. Moreover, the introduction of travel restrictions and strict lockdown measures have forced the closure of many institutions and laboratories working on research unrelated to the pandemic. The lockdown has similarly stifled supply chains and slowed research and development endeavours, whilst research charities have endured significant financial strains that have since reshaped the allocation and availability of funds. Worldwide scientific adaptation to the COVID-19 pandemic has also been observed through unprecedented levels of international collaboration as well as the uprise of remote telecommunication platforms. Although the long-term consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic on research and academic training is difficult to ascertain, the current crises will inevitably shape working and teaching patterns for years to come.

Coronavirus RNA synthesis is thought to be associated with replication organelles (ROs) consisting of modified endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. These are transformed into double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) containing viral double-stranded RNA and into other membranous elements such as convoluted membranes, together forming a reticulovesicular network. Previous evidence suggested that the nonstructural proteins (nsp’s) 3, 4, and 6 of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which contain transmembrane domains, would all be required for DMV formation. We have now expressed MERS-CoV replicase self-cleaving polyprotein fragments encompassing nsp3-4 or nsp3-6, as well as coexpressed nsp3 and nsp4 of either MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV, to characterize the membrane structures induced. Using electron tomography, we demonstrate that for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV coexpression of nsp3 and nsp4 is required and sufficient to induce DMVs. Coexpression of MERS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4 either as individual proteins or as a self-cleaving nsp3-4 precursor resulted in very similar DMVs, and in both setups we observed proliferation of zippered ER that appeared to wrap into nascent DMVs. Moreover, when inactivating nsp3-4 polyprotein cleavage by mutagenesis, we established that cleavage of the nsp3/nsp4 junction is essential for MERS-CoV DMV formation. Addition of the third MERS-CoV transmembrane protein, nsp6, did not noticeably affect DMV formation. These findings provide important insight into the biogenesis of coronavirus DMVs, establish strong similarities with other nidoviruses (specifically, the arteriviruses), and highlight possible general principles in viral DMV formation.","Oudshoorn, Diede; Rijs, Kevin; Limpens, Ronald W.

Housing floor area is an ambiguous concept in Hong Kong because it covers a possible exaggeration of the amount of ‘private space’ exclusively enjoyed by the owner and an unidentifiable portion of ‘public space’ shared with other owners within the development. Using hedonic pricing models, this study has found that different distributions between private and shared space command different values from the housing buyers. Shared communal space generally exerts a downward pressure on housing prices. The buyers are willing to pay more for the private space and some desirable forms of communal space. A higher willingness-to-pay for the desirable attributes such as clubhouse indicates that the Hong Kong people are increasingly concerned about the quality of living space in the built environment. This study suggests a need of further research into the exact measurement and the different forms of housing space rather than simply taking the stated floor space figures for granted.","Chan, Edwin Hon-Wan; So, Hing-Mei; Tang, Bo-Sin; Wong, Wah-Sang",Habitat Int,318,20

Previous work has established that, over time, rates of Black and White mortality have converged; however, some studies suggest that regional shifts in COVID19 prevalence may play a role in the relative change between racial groups. The study objective was to investigate changes in Black and White COVID19 mortality over time and uncover potential mechanisms driving these changes. Methods and Findings: Using county level COVID-19 mortality data stratified by race, we investigate the trajectory of non Hispanic Black mortality, White mortality, and the Black/White per capita mortality ratio from June 2020 to January 2021. Over this period, in the counties studied, cumulative mortality rose by 56.7% and 82.8% for Black and White populations respectively, resulting in a decrease in mortality ratio of 0.369 (23.8%). These trends persisted even when a county-level fixed-effects model was used to estimate changes over time within counties (controlling for all time invariant county level characteristics and removing the effects of changes in regional distribution of COVID19). Next, we leverage county level variation over time in COVID19 prevalence to show that the declines in the Black/White mortality ratio can be explained by changes in COVID19 prevalence. Finally, we study heterogeneity in the time trend, finding that convergence occurs most significantly in younger populations, areas with less dense populations, and outside of the Northeast. Limitations include suppressed data in counties with fewer than 10 deaths in a racial category, and the use of provisional COVID19 death data that may be incomplete. Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that convergence in Black/White mortality is not driven by county level characteristics or changes in the regional dispersion of COVID19, but instead by changes within counties. Further, declines in the Black/White mortality ratio appear strongly linked to changes in COVID19 prevalence, rather than a time specific effect. Further studies on changes in exposure by race over time, or on the vulnerability of individuals who died at different points in the pandemic, may provide crucial insight on mechanisms and strategies to further reduce COVID19 mortality disparities.","Lawton, R.

However, the neglected homeless population may become victims of that perceived success. Due to political sensitivity, we know little about them. Aims: This study aimed to investigate how the pandemic and the pandemic control strategies of the government affected the lives of the homeless people in mainland China. Methods: A total of 103 eligible participants experiencing absolute homelessness were recruited from Guangzhou City during July and August 2020. Surveys measured demographic characteristics including health status, changes in daily living, and actions of the government toward the homeless during the pandemic. Sankey diagrams and ordered logit regression models were used to examine the impact on the homeless of inhumane government efforts to drive the homeless away. Qualitative materials were analyzed by using an inductive approach to provide more details. Results: First, the homeless people in Guangzhou tended to be male, aged 40 to 64 years, less well-educated, and they originated from outside Guangdong although they were living in the city center. Most had little connection with their families. After a long period of homelessness, almost half of the participants were in poor health with various conditions, which made them extremely vulnerable to COVID-19. Second, the pandemic caused a substantial decline in incomes of homeless people, had less of a negative impact on their food intake, and affected sleep time in different ways. Third, during the COVID-19 pandemic, humanitarian aid from local governments of China decreased, whereas inhumane efforts to drive the homeless away intensified. Fourth, quantitative models and qualitative materials demonstrate the devastating effect of the strict pandemic control strategy of the government on the lives of homeless people, which may further cause their health problems. Conclusion: This study for the first time illustrated the characteristic features of the street homeless population in mainland China and their living situation during the COVID-19 pandemic, and most importantly demonstrated the devastating effect of the strict pandemic control of the government, which has been considered a great success in previous studies, on lives of homeless people.

This caused a series of strict containment measures, aimed at blocking the spread of the pandemic. Healthcare delivery was also affected when resources were diverted towards care of COVID-19 patients, including intensive care wards. AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim is assessing the impact of COVID-19 on cardiac imaging in Italy, compare to the Rest of Europe (RoE) and the World (RoW). METHODS: A global survey was conducted in May–June 2020 worldwide, through a questionnaire distributed online. The survey covered three periods: March and April 2020, and March 2019. Data from 52 Italian centres, a subset of the 909 participating centres from 108 countries, were analyzed. RESULTS: In Italy, volumes decreased by 67% in March 2020, compared to March 2019, as opposed to a significantly lower decrease (p < 0.001) in RoE and RoW (41% and 40%, respectively). A further decrease from March 2020 to April 2020 summed up to 76% for the North, 77% for the Centre and 86% for the South. When compared to the RoE and RoW, this further decrease from March 2020 to April 2020 in Italy was significantly less (p = 0.005), most likely reflecting the earlier effects of the containment measures in Italy, taken earlier than anywhere else in the West.

The etiology of anemia predominates from ineffective erythropoiesis from marrow infiltration, cytokine related suppression, erythropoietin suppression, and vitamin deficiency; ineffective erythropoiesis is further exacerbated by accelerated clearance due to antibody mediated hemolysis and thrombotic microangiopathy. As the anemia is chronic in nature, symptoms are generally well tolerated and often non-specific. Transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) is a balance between providing benefit for patients while avoiding risks of transfusion. Conservative/restrictive RBC transfusion practices have shown equivalent patient outcomes compared to liberal transfusion practices, and meta-analysis has shown improved in-hospital mortality, reduced cardiac events, re-bleeding, and bacterial infections. The implications for a lower threshold for transfusion in patients with malignancies are therefore increasingly being scrutinized. Alternative management strategies for anemia with IV iron and erythropoietin stimulating agents (ESAs) should be considered in the appropriate settings.","Shah, Neil; Andrews, Jennifer; Goodnough, Lawrence Tim",Blood Rev,318,5

However, the literature on transmission routes and risk factors for COVID-19 in HCWs is limited. AIM: To examine the characteristics and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs in a university teaching hospital in London, UK. METHODS: Staff records and virology testing results were combined to identify staff sickness and COVID-19 rates from March to April 2020. Comparisons were made with staff professional groups, department of work and ethnicity. Analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel(TM). FINDINGS: COVID-19 rates in our HCWs largely rose and declined in parallel with the number of community cases. White and non-white ethnic groups among our HCWs had similar rates of infection. Clinical staff had a higher rate of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 than non-clinical staff, but total sickness rates were similar. Doctors had the highest rate of infection, but took the fewest sickness days. Critical Care had lower rates than the Emergency Department (ED), but rates in the ED declined once all staff were advised to use Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). CONCLUSION: These findings show that sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among our hospital staff did not occur, beyond the community outbreak, even in the absence of strict infection control measures in non-clinical areas. The results also suggest that current PPE is effective when used appropriately. In addition, our findings emphasise the importance of testing both clinical and non-clinical staff groups during a pandemic.","Zheng, Charlotte; Hafezi-Bakhtiari, Nema; Cooper, Victoria; Davidson, Harriet; Habibi, Maximillian; Riley, Peter; Breathnach, Aodhan",J Hosp Infect,318,3

On September 28, 2020, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) contacted CDC to report a COVID-19 outbreak in a state prison (prison A). During October 6-20, a CDC team investigated the outbreak, which began with 12 cases detected from specimens collected during August 17-24 from incarcerated persons housed within the same unit, 10 of whom were transferred together on August 13 and under quarantine following prison intake procedures (intake quarantine). Potentially exposed persons within the unit began a 14-day group quarantine on August 25. However, quarantine was not restarted after quarantined persons were potentially exposed to incarcerated persons with COVID-19 who were moved to the unit. During the subsequent 8 weeks (August 14-October 22), 869 (79.4%) of 1,095 incarcerated persons and 69 (22.6%) of 305 staff members at prison A received positive test results for SARS-CoV-2. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of specimens from 172 cases among incarcerated persons showed that all clustered in the same lineage; this finding, along with others, demonstrated that facility spread originated with the transferred cohort. To effectively implement a cohorted quarantine, which is a harm reduction strategy for correctional settings with limited space, CDC's interim guidance recommendation is to serial test cohorts, restarting the 14-day quarantine period when a new case is identified (3). Implementing more effective intake quarantine procedures and available mitigation measures, including vaccination, among incarcerated persons is important to controlling transmission in prisons. Understanding and addressing the challenges faced by correctional facilities to implement medical isolation and quarantine can help reduce and prevent outbreaks.","Hershow, Rebecca B.; Segaloff, Hannah E.; Shockey, Abigail C.; Florek, Kelsey R.; Murphy, Sabrina K.; DuBose, Weston; Schaeffer, Tammy L.; Powell, MPH, Jo Anna; Gayle, Krystal; Lambert, Lauren; Schwitters, Amee; Clarke, Kristie E.N.; Westergaard, Ryan",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,318,5

Surgical Departments need to adapt to this change. Patients and methods We performed a prospective descriptive observational study of the incidence of COVID-19 in patients and surgeons of a General Surgical Department in a high prevalence area, between the 1 st and 31 st of March 2020. Results Patients: The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in elective surgery patients was 7% (mean age 59.5 years). All survived. Of 36 patients who underwent emergency surgery, two of them were SARS-CoV-2 positive and one was clinically highly suspicious of COVID-19 (11.1%). All three patients died of respiratory failure (mean age 81 years). Surgeons: There were a total of 12 confirmed SARS-CoV-2+ cases among the surgical department staff (24.4%) (8 out of 34 consultants and 4 out of 15 residents). Healthcare activity: The average number of daily emergency surgical interventions declined from 3.6 in February to 1.16 in March. 42% of the patients who underwent emergency surgery had peritonitis upon presentation. Conclusions The fast pace of COVID-19 pandemia, should alert surgical departments of the need of adopting early measures to ensure the safety of patients and staff.","Álvarez Gallego, M.; Gortázar de las Casas, S.; Pascual Migueláñez, I.; Rubio-Pérez, I.; Barragán Serrano, C.; Álvarez Peña, E.; Díaz Domínguez, J.",,318,29

It plays a key role in most cellular processes including immune signaling. Deregulation of this process is a major causative factor for many diseases. A major advancement in the identification and characterization of the enzymes that remove ubiquitin, deubiquitylases (DUBs) was made by the development of activity-based probes (ABPs). Recent advances in chemical protein synthesis and ligation methodology has yielded novel reagents for use in ubiquitylation research. We describe recent advances and discuss future directions in reagent development for studying DUBs.","Ekkebus, Reggy; Flierman, Dennis; Geurink, Paul P; Ovaa, Huib",Curr Opin Chem Biol,318,12
