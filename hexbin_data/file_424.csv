3745,Trajectories of School Recovery After a Natural Disaster: Risk and Protective Factors,2018-09-25,"Disasters may have significant and lasting impacts on educational programs and academic achievement, yet the examination of differing patterns of school recovery after disasters is understudied. This paper focused on two aims: (i) identification of school academic recovery trajectories; and (ii) examination of potential risk factors associated with these trajectories. We used latent class growth analysis to identify school academic recovery trajectories for a cohort of 462 Texas public schools that were in the path of Hurricane Ike in 2008. Using Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) data from 2005 to 2011, we found that attendance and percent of economically disadvantaged youth emerged as significant risk factors for two identified academic recovery trajectories (High‐Stable and Low‐Interrupted). Higher levels of economically disadvantaged youth were associated with lower likelihood of falling in the High‐Stable trajectory, relative to the Low‐Interrupted trajectory. Higher levels of attendance were associated with higher likelihood of membership in the High‐Stable trajectory, relative to the Low‐Interrupted trajectory. These findings are consistent with the notion that disasters do not affect all people or communities equally. Findings highlight the need for policy initiatives that focus on low performing schools, as these schools are at highest risk for adverse outcomes post‐disaster.","Lai, Betty S.; Esnard, Ann‐Margaret; Wyczalkowski, Chris; Savage, Ryan; Shah, Hazel",Risk Hazards Crisis Public Policy,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6456061/,424

5408,"The Social Indicators Movement: Progress, Paradigms, Puzzles, Promise and Potential Research Directions",2017-01-11,"Picornaviruses are small animal viruses with positive-strand genomic RNA, which is translated using cap-independent internal translation initiation. The key role in this is played by ciselements of the 5""-untranslated region (5""-UTR) and, in particular, by the internal ribosome entry site (IRES). The function of translational ciselements requires both canonical translation initiation factors (eIFs) and additional IRES trans-acting factors (ITAFs). All known ITAFs are cell RNA-binding proteins which play a variety of functions in noninfected cells. Specific features of translational ciselements substantially affect the phenotype and, in particular, tissue tropism and pathogenic properties of picornaviruses. It is clear that, in some cases, the molecular mechanism involved is a change in interactions between viral ciselements and ITAFs. The properties and tissue distribution of ITAFs may determine the biological properties of other viruses that also use the IRES-dependent translation initiation. Since this mechanism is also involved in translation of several cell mRNAs, ITAF may contribute to the regulation of the most important aspects of the living activity in noninfected cells.","Agol, V.

10241,SARS and its effect on medical education in Hong Kong,2003-10-30,"Since its first emergence in 1998 in Malaysia, Nipah virus (NiV) has become a great threat to domestic animals and humans. Sporadic outbreaks associated with human‐to‐human transmission caused hundreds of human fatalities. Here, we collected all available NiV sequences and combined phylogenetics, molecular selection, structural biology and receptor analysis to study the emergence and adaptive evolution of NiV. NiV can be divided into two main lineages including the Bangladesh and Malaysia lineages. We formly confirmed a significant association with geography which is probably the result of long‐term evolution of NiV in local bat population. The two NiV lineages differ in many amino acids; one change in the fusion protein might be involved in its activation via binding to the G protein. We also identified adaptive and positively selected sites in many viral proteins. In the receptor‐binding G protein, we found that sites 384, 386 and especially 498 of G protein might modulate receptor‐binding affinity and thus contribute to the host jump from bats to humans via the adaption to bind the human ephrin‐B2 receptor. We also found that site 1645 in the connector domain of L was positive selected and involved in adaptive evolution; this site might add methyl groups to the cap structure present at the 5′‐end of the RNA and thus modulate its activity. This study provides insight to assist the design of early detection methods for NiV to assess its epidemic potential in humans.","Li, Kemang; Yan, Shiyu; Wang, Ningning; He, Wanting; Guan, Haifei; He, Chengxi; Wang, Zhixue; Lu, Meng; He, Wei; Ye, Rui; Veit, Michael; Su, Shuo",Transbound Emerg Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7168560/,424
10973,Predictive impact of early mobilization on rehospitalization for elderly Japanese heart failure patients,2019-09-26,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The nature and outcomes of infection among patients with cirrhosis in safety-net hospitals are not well described. We aimed to characterize the rate of and risk factors for infection, both present on admission and nosocomial, in this unique population. We hypothesized that infections would be associated with adverse outcomes such as short-term mortality. METHODS: We used descriptive statistics to characterize infections within a retrospective cohort characterized previously. We used multivariable logistic regression models to assess potential risk factors for infection and associations with key outcomes such as short-term mortality and length of stay. RESULTS: The study cohort of 1112 patients included 33% women with a mean age of 56 ± 10 years. Infections were common (20%), with respiratory and urinary tract infections the most frequent. We did not observe a difference in the incidence of infection on admission based on patient demographic factors such as race/ethnicity or estimated household income. Infections on admission were associated with greater short-term mortality (12% vs 4% in-hospital and 14% vs 7% 30-day), longer length of stay (6 vs 3 days), intensive care unit admission (28% vs 18%), and acute-on-chronic liver failure (10% vs 2%) (p < 0.01 for all). Nosocomial infections were relatively uncommon (4%), but more frequent among patients admitted to the intensive care unit. Antibiotic resistance was common (38%), but not associated with negative outcomes. CONCLUSION: We did not identify demographic risk factors for infection, but did confirm its morbid effect among patients with cirrhosis in safety-net hospitals.

15726,Review of the Medical Student Performance Evaluation: analysis of the end-users’ perspective across the specialties,2021-02-19,"The rise in popularity and demand for nonsurgical injectable aesthetic procedures is inherently accompanied by an increase in reported complications, particularly those related to infection. Aseptic technique is under the control of aesthetic practitioners and can be modified to minimize the potential for cross‐contamination and infection. This should be a key consideration during all clinical procedures, particularly those involving breach of the skin's natural defenses and the use of soft tissue filler. A consensus group of five UK expert aesthetic clinicians were convened to discuss current best practice for aseptic techniques in medical aesthetics. The aim of the consensus group was to recommend a step‐by‐step procedure to achieve optimal aseptic practice in private clinics, and define important considerations for reducing infection risk during the whole patient journey: pre‐, during‐ and postaesthetic procedure. Recommendations were based on current evidence and extensive clinical experience. Various procedure recommendations were made to achieve and maintain a high standard of asepsis and infection control. Guidance was divided into three phases for patients and health care professionals, covering preprocedure (including patient selection), during‐procedure, and postprocedure considerations. Although adherence to standard hospital guidance on handwashing and cleanliness measures is a cornerstone of controlling cross‐contamination, aesthetic clinics carry a high potential risk of infection—particularly as popular treatments with dermal fillers primarily involve the face. This expert consensus guidance recommends procedures to mitigate the potential risks of asepsis.","Murthy, Rachna; Eccleston, David; Mckeown, Darren; Parikh, Apul; Shotter, Sophie",Dermatol Ther,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7900975/,424
18781,The Numerous Benefits of Social Media for Medicine. Comment on “Documenting Social Media Engagement as Scholarship: A New Model for Assessing Academic Accomplishment for the Health Professions”,2021-06-09,"BACKGROUND: Antibiotic misuse is a serious public health problem worldwide. National health authorities release clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to guide general practitioners (GPs) in their choice of antibiotics. However, despite the large-scale dissemination of CPGs, GPs continue to prescribe antibiotics that are not recommended as first-line treatments. This nonadherence to recommendations may be due to GPs misunderstanding the CPGs. A web interface displaying antibiotic prescription recommendations and their justifications could help to improve the comprehensibility and readability of CPGs, thereby increasing the adoption of recommendations regarding antibiotic treatment. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to design and evaluate a web interface for antibiotic prescription displaying both the recommended antibiotics and their justifications in the form of antibiotic properties. METHODS: A web interface was designed according to the same principles as e-commerce interfaces and was assessed by 117 GPs. These GPs were asked to answer 17 questions relating to the usefulness, user-friendliness, and comprehensibility and readability of the interface, and their satisfaction with it. Responses were recorded on a 4-point Likert scale (ranging from “absolutely disagree” to “absolutely agree”). At the end of the evaluation, the GPs were allowed to provide optional, additional free comments. RESULTS: The antibiotic prescription web interface consists of three main sections: a clinical summary section, a filter section, and a recommended antibiotics section. The majority of GPs appreciated the clinical summary (90/117, 76.9%) and filter (98/117, 83.8%) sections, whereas 48.7% (57/117) of them reported difficulty reading some of the icons in the recommended antibiotics section. Overall, 82.9% (97/117) of GPs found the display of drug properties useful, and 65.8% (77/117) reported that the web interface improved their understanding of CPG recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: The web interface displaying antibiotic recommendations and their properties can help doctors understand the rationale underlying CPG recommendations regarding antibiotic treatment, but further improvements are required before its implementation into a clinical decision support system.","Madar, Ronni; Ugon, Adrien; Ivanković, Damir; Tsopra, Rosy",J Med Internet Res,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8235275/,424
20550,The Current Accreditation Standards and Future Needs in Medical Education,2020-09-09,"BACKGROUND: The benefit of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in patients with leptomeningeal metastases (LMM) is unknown. METHODS: We undertook a phase II trial of pembrolizumab in patients with LMM from solid tumors. Eligible patients had radiologic/cytologic LMM and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0–1. Pembrolizumab was administered intravenously at 200 mg q3W until disease progression/unacceptable toxicity. The primary endpoint was central nervous system (CNS) response after four cycles, defined radiologically/cytologically/clinically. Serial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was assessed for tumor-derived DNA (t-DNA) aneuploidy and cytokines. RESULTS: Thirteen of a planned 16 patients were treated between April 2017 and December 2019. The study closed early for poor accrual. Median age was 57 years (range: 22–79). Sixty-two percent of patients had tumors not traditionally ICI-responsive (hormone-receptor (HR)-positive breast carcinoma=39%; high-grade glioma=23%), while 38% had ICI-responsive tumors (non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)=23%, head and neck carcinoma=8%, cutaneous squamous carcinoma (CSC)=8%). CNS response was observed in 38% of patients at 12 weeks (95% CI 13.9% to 68.4%) by pre-defined criteria and LM-RANO, and 2 achieved durable complete responses (CSC=1, overall survival (OS) 3+ years; NSCLC=1, OS 9 months). Median CNS progression-free survival and OS was 2.9 months (95% CI 1.3 to NR) and 4.9 months (95% CI 3.7 to NR), respectively. Grade 3+ treatment-related adverse events occurred in 15% of patients. Sensitivity for LMM detection by t-DNA and cytopathology was 84.6% (95% CI 54.6% to 98.1%) and 53.9% (95% CI 25.1% to 80.8%), respectively. Pre-therapy and on-therapy CSF cytokine analysis demonstrated complete responders clustered together. CONCLUSIONS: Pembrolizumab conferred a 38% CNS response rate in patients with LMM, a tolerable safety profile, and deep responses in selected patients with ICI-responsive tumors. CSF t-DNA may be sensitive for LMM detection, and immunologic subsets of CNS response warrant further study.

21897,"Examining the relationships between medical students’ preferred online instructional strategies, course difficulty level, learning performance, and effectiveness",2021-12-01,"Artificial neural network (ANN) is one of the techniques in artificial intelligence, which has been widely applied in many fields for prediction purposes, including wind speed prediction. The aims of this research is to determine the topology of neural network that are used to predict wind speed. Topology determination means finding the hidden layers number and the hidden neurons number for corresponding hidden layer in the neural network. The difference between this research and previous research is that the objective function of this research is regression, while the objective function of previous research is classification. Determination of the topology of the neural network using principal component analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering. PCA is used to determine the hidden layers number, while clustering is used to determine the hidden neurons number for corresponding hidden layer. The selected topology is then used to predict wind speed. Then the performance of topology determination using PCA and clustering is then compared with several other methods. The results of the experiment show that the performance of the neural network topology determined using PCA and clustering has better performance than the other methods being compared. Performance is determined based on the RMSE value, the smaller the RMSE value, the better the neural network performance. In future research, it is necessary to apply a correlation or relationship between input attribute and output attribute and then analyzed, prior to conducting PCA and clustering analysis.","Rachmatullah, Muhammad Ibnu Choldun; Santoso, Judhi; Surendro, Kridanto",PeerJ Comput Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8459779/,424

Using the CompLearn Toolkit, the built-in compressors zlib and bzip2 are compared. Moreover, a comparison is made with respect to hierarchical and spectral clustering. For the hierarchical clustering, hclust from the R package is used, and the spectral clustering is done via the kLine algorithm proposed by Fischer and Poland (2004). Our results are very promising and show that one can obtain an (almost) perfect clustering. It turned out that the zlib compressor allowed for better results than the bzip2 compressor and, if all data are concerned, then hierarchical clustering is a bit better than spectral clustering via kLines.","Ito, Kimihito; Zeugmann, Thomas; Zhu, Yu",Algorithms and Applications,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121547/,424

33438,COVID-19: Antikoagulation könnte Überlebenschancen erhöhen,2020-06-10,"Long term stress often causes depression and neuronal atrophies that in turn can lead to a variety of health problems. As a result of these cellular changes, also molecular changes occur. These changes, that include increase of glucocorticoids and decrease of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor, have the unfortunate effect that they decrease the cognitive abilities needed for the individual to solve the stressful situation. Such cognitive abilities like reappraisal and their adaptation mechanisms turn out to be substantially impaired while they are needed for regulation of the negative emotions. However, antidepressant treatments and some other therapies have proved to be quite effective for the strengthening of such cognitive abilities. This study introduces an adaptive causal network model for this phenomenon where a subject loses his or her cognitive abilities (negative metaplasticity) due to long-term stress and re-improve these cognitive abilities (positive metaplasticity) through mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT). Simulation results have been reported for demonstration of the phenomenon.","Ullah, Nimat; Treur, Jan",Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7256584/,424

39971,A Century of South African Housing Acts 1920–2020,2020-09-29,"Aquaculture is the fastest growing primary industry worldwide. Marine finfish culture in open ocean net pens, or pontoons, is one of the largest growth areas and is currently the only way to rear high value fish such as bluefin tuna. Ranching involves catching wild juveniles, stocking in floating net pens and fattening for 4 to 8 months. Tuna experience several parasite-induced disease challenges in culture that can be mitigated by application of praziquantel (PZQ) as a therapeutic. In this study, we characterized the microbiome of ranched southern Bluefin Tuna, Thunnus maccoyii, across four anatomic sites (gill, skin, digesta, and anterior kidney) and evaluated environmental and pathological factors that influence microbiome composition, including the impact of PZQ treatment on microbiome stability. Southern bluefin tuna gill, skin, and digesta microbiome communities are unique and potentially influenced by husbandry practices, location of pontoon growout pens, and treatment with the antiparasitic PZQ. There was no significant relationship between the fish mucosal microbiome and incidence or abundance of adult blood fluke in the heart or fluke egg density in the gill. An enhanced understanding of microbiome diversity and function in high-value farmed fish species such as bluefin tuna is needed to optimize fish health and improve aquaculture yield. Comparison of the bluefin tuna microbiome to other fish species, including Seriola lalandi (yellowtail kingfish), a common farmed species from Australia, and Scomber japonicus (Pacific mackerel), a wild caught Scombrid relative of tuna, showed the two Scombrids had more similar microbial communities compared to other families. The finding that mucosal microbial communities are more similar in phylogenetically related fish species exposes an opportunity to develop mackerel as a model for tuna microbiome and parasite research.","Minich, Jeremiah J.; Power, Cecilia; Melanson, Michaela; Knight, Rob; Webber, Claire; Rough, Kirsten; Bott, Nathan J.; Nowak, Barbara; Allen, Eric E.",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7476325/,424

The methodology used in this study was a bibliographic survey of studies on the toxic effects related to honeybees, with a critical analysis of the possible risks of accidental ingestion of these insects. The amount of venom present in a bee is considered insufficient to induce detectable toxic effects in a person who ingests it by accident, and various components of the venom are destroyed by gastric secretions. However, despite the rare frequency, there is a risk of the ingestion of a bee, causing an allergic reaction to some components of the venom in sensitized individuals. In addition, pollen carried by a bee may cause an allergic reaction in a sensitive individual. Thus, the accidental ingestion of a bee present in a food does not pose the risk of toxic effects for the majority of the population but may promote allergic reactions in susceptible individuals.","Marinho, Jéssica Baeça Rezende; Soto-Blanco, Benito",Front Vet Sci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7561407/,424

Hospitals cancelled elective surgeries and telemedicine was adopted as a common tool to keep providing care while minimizing patients' risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: To respond to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 we implemented several measures to contribute to flattening the COVID-19 curve. Our neurosurgery department performed an evaluation of the upcoming clinic visits, and either converted to telemedicine or rescheduled patients that were considered not to be significantly impacted by a postponement. Until March 2020 almost 100% of our clinic visits were face-to-face, in April 55% of our clinic visits were via telemedicine. Telemedicine was performed as video with audio or by telephone call. Video visits were conducted via the application Zoom due to its HIPPA compliance and its integration with the electronic medical record Epic. RESULTS: Telemedicine played a key role in our strategy to prioritize in person care for neurosurgical patients in need of urgent care while maintaining follow-ups and avoiding delays in care for other patients. During the month of April our neurosurgery department performed 315 telemedicine visits among all the different subspecialties. 172 (55%) were phone consults, 143 (45%) video consults; 101 (32%) were new consults, 195 (62%) return visits, 18 (6) post-operative follow-ups. New consults were mainly carried-out as video with audio, while return visits and post-operative follow-ups were predominantly phone calls. Only 39 (12%) of this patients required surgery. CONCLUSION: We describe our experience with telemedicine in neurosurgery as an effective tool to provide care during the COVID-19 pandemic while decreasing the risk of transmission of the virus. There are still many regulatory requirements to be addressed, but telemedicine emerged from this pandemic as a valuable tool to conduct neurosurgical visits that in the future can potentially relieve the burden of travel seeking medical opinions at tertiary centers.","De Biase, Gaetano; Freeman, William; Smith, Nathan; Jerreld, Daniel; Quiñones-Hinojosa, Alfredo; Abode-Iyamah, Kingsley",Neurosurgery,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7717390/,424
44182,The social contagion of work avoidance goals in school and its influence on student (dis)engagement,2021-01-06,"BACKGROUND: COVID-19 had spread quickly, causing an international public health emergency with an alarming global shortage of COVID-19 diagnostic tests. We developed and clinically validated a next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based target enrichment assay with the COVID-DX Software tailored for the detection, characterization, and surveillance of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome. METHODS: The SARS-CoV-2 NGS assay consists of components including library preparation, target enrichment, sequencing, and a COVID-DX Software analysis tool. The NGS library preparation starts with extracted RNA from nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs followed by cDNA synthesis and conversion to Illumina TruSeq-compatible libraries using the Twist Library Preparation Kit via Enzymatic Fragmentation and Unique Dual Indices (UDI). The library is then enriched for SARS-CoV-2 sequences using a panel of dsDNA biotin-labeled probes, specifically designed to target the SARS-CoV-2 genome, then sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 550 platform. The COVID-DX Software analyzes sequence results and provides a clinically oriented report, including the presence/absence of SARS-CoV-2 for diagnostic use. An additional research use only report describes the assay performance, estimated viral titer, coverage across the viral genome, genetic variants, and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: The SARS-CoV-2 NGS Assay was validated on 30 positive and 30 negative clinical samples. To measure the sensitivity and specificity of the assay, the positive and negative percent agreement (PPA, NPA) was defined in comparison to an orthogonal EUA RT-PCR assay (PPA [95% CI]: 96.77% [90.56%-100%] and NPA [95% CI]: 100% [100%-100%]). Data reported using our assay defined the limit of detection to be 40 copies/ml using heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 viral genome in clinical matrices. In-silico analysis provided >99.9% coverage across the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome and no cross-reactivity with evolutionarily similar respiratory pathogens. CONCLUSION: The SARS-CoV-2 NGS Assay powered by the COVID-DX Software can be used to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus and provide additional insight into viral titer and genetic variants to track transmission, stratify risk, predict outcome and therapeutic response, and control the spread of infectious disease.

47387,Conclusions,2020-12-09,"Research from the field of planetary- and geoscience require investigation of geological features in harsh environments. Sampled data needs to be precisely localized spatially and in time, and to be prepared appropriately for further inspection and evaluation. In the case of thermal image data, the computer vision community has made enormous progress in the past years to combine thermal with spatial information in form of thermal 3D models. In this paper, we propose to use a camera-based hand-held sensor system to capture and georeference thermal images in rugged terrain and to prepare the data for further investigations by visualizing the thermal data in 3D. We use a global localization solution to gain fast 3D impressions of the environment and further Structure from Motion to generate detailed mid-scale models of selected interesting structures. We demonstrate our application based on a challenging dataset that we acquired in the active fumarole fields of Vulcano, Sicily.","Irmisch, Patrick; Ernst, Ines; Baumbach, Dirk; Linkiewicz, Magdalena M.; Unnithan, Vikram; Sohl, Frank; Wohlfeil, Jürgen; Grießbach, Denis",Geometry and Vision,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971804/,424

Reflecting on the State and Politics in the MENA Region,2020-12-09,"This paper presents an algorithm for lane line detection based on convolutional neural network. The algorithm adopts the structural mode of encoder and decoder, in which the encoder part uses VGG16 combined with cavity convolution as the basic network to extract the features of lane lines, and the cavity convolution can expand the receptive field. Through experimental comparison, the full connection layer of the network is discarded, the last maximum pooling layer of the VGG16 network is removed, and the processing of the last three convolutional layers is replaced by empty convolution, which can better balance the detection rate and accuracy. The decoder part USES the index function of the maximum pooling layer to carry out up-sampling of the encoder in an anti-pooling way to achieve semantic segmentation, and combines with the instance segmentation, and finally realizes the detection of lane lines through fitting. The test results show that the algorithm has a good balance in speed and accuracy and good robustness.","Ding, Ling; Xu, Zhuoran; Zong, JiaFei; Xiao, Jinshen; Shu, Chen; Xu, Bin",Geometry and Vision,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971827/,424

However, there is a problem of high system resource consumption level in the traditional visualized teaching system for infant basketball courses. Therefore, a data-driven visualized teaching system design for infant basketball courses is proposed. The hardware part adopts the intelligent display terminal DMT80480507OSW to realize human-computer interaction, which allows children to increase learning interest through human-computer interaction. The software part uses data compression algorithms to compress basketball course resource data. After testing, the feasibility of the design system was proved to provide richer teaching resources for children’s basketball courses.","Qin, Yun-fei; Mo, Lu-zhen; Chen, Can","e-Learning, e-Education, and Online Training",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7971914/,424

Understanding the ecosystem and how its elements interact is essential for software evolution, especially for those that provide functions and services for other systems, such as software APIs. Once an API is being used by different software, future changes need to be made in a systematic and appropriate manner, considering the whole ecosystem. However, there is a lack of formal and effective ways for APIs evaluation in the context of SECO. Thus, in this paper, we present Ecolyzer, a prototype tool that aims to support the analysis of API usage considering its ecosystem through interactive visualization. To demonstrate the feasibility of our tool, we conducted a proof of concept (PoC) using an open-source platform API. The results obtained with Ecolyzer are useful and show that the prototype meets the goals described for the accomplishment of this work.","Avancini, Rodrigo; Silveira, Fábio Fagundes; Guerra, Eduardo Martins; Andrade, Pedro R.",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7975003/,424

Poland has seen renewed attempts to restrict women’s reproductive rights and revert to traditional gender roles as Catholic bishops rail against the pernicious influence of “gender ideology.” (Kościańska 2014). In Hungary, anti-gender policies have led to new rhetoric of “family mainstreaming,” and Viktor Orbán himself has said that women can only be promoted in his administration if they have three children (Juhász 2016). Fears about falling birth rates throughout the region have led to a resurgence of patriarchal, nationalist political movements, which reject supposedly foreign notions of gender equality.

International trade and tourism is reliant on commercial aviation, and the most successful cities have buses, trams, or subways connecting workers to their workplaces. However, the efficiency and connectivity of modern transportation networks leaves us vulnerable to the spread of diseases. In this paper, we introduce a general agent-based framework for modeling disease propagation on networks and use it to build models of major transportation networks. Using our models, we take a look at how disease spreads throughout a city. We pay particular attention to predicting the regions of a city which are likely to become disease hot-spots. This is of particular interest to city planners who want to allocate resources appropriately to combat an outbreak. Using information about subway routes, ridership, and city-wide countermeasures, we were able to predict areas with high caseloads during the onset of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. Our findings suggest a correlation between these factors and the spread of COVID-19, Influenza-Like Illnesses, and other contagious diseases.","Cheung, Ho Lum; Muñoz-Montesinos, Dimas","Recent Trends in Analysis of Images, Social Networks and Texts",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7988412/,424
50341,Conclusion,2020-06-02,"With the rise of social media and digital advertising, the newspaper industry was in decline in 2019, and Covid-19 accelerated the decline. Sadly, for newspapers that had not built a substantial online subscription base, severe cost cutting was not expected to offset the plunge in advertising revenue from small- and medium-sized enterprises whose revenues were reduced by social distancing. Without a significant infusion of additional capital, most traditional newspapers would not be able to accelerate their online subscriptions enough to become sustainable. Simply put, the fate of many newspapers depended on whether they could persuade private equity firms to acquire them: yet as we will see later in this chapter, exiting the industry in this way cost many jobs and transferred to the new owners the dwindling cash flows from an aging population of print newspaper subscribers. Absent transferring newspapers to private equity or other financial buyers, liquidation appeared to be a likely fate for many newspapers.","Cohan, Peter S.",Goliath Strikes Back,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7989896/,424

In order to obtain more data about the use of video games by Canadian children, and in particular by ADHD children, we explored the modalities of use (playtime, addiction score and usage by age) and compared them between ADHD and non-ADHD children. We then examined associations between addiction and ADHD symptoms and explored innovative results about the gender impact. Our study was cross-sectional, multicenter in child psychiatrist departments, exploratory and descriptive. We recruited three groups of children aged 4–12 years: the ADHD Group, the Clinical-Control Group and the Community-Control Group. For each group, the material used consisted of questionnaires completed by one of the parents. Data collection took place from December 2016 to August 2018 in Montreal (n = 280). Our study highlighted a vulnerability in ADHD children: they would exhibit more addictive behaviors with respect to video games (Addiction score: 1.1025 in ADHD Group vs. 0.6802 in Community-Control Group) and prolonged periods of use. We also observed a correlation between the severity of ADHD symptoms and excessive use of video games (p = 0.000). Children with severe ADHD showed significantly higher addiction scores and, in a multiple regression analysis a combination of gender and ADHD explained the excessive use of video games.","Masi, Laura; Abadie, Pascale; Herba, Catherine; Emond, Mutsuko; Gingras, Marie-Pier; Amor, Leila Ben",Front Pediatr,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7994285/,424

51702,Factors Influence Students’ Switching Behavior to Online Learning under COVID-19 Pandemic: A Push–Pull–Mooring Model Perspective,2021-04-19,"Background: The emergence and resurgence of zoonotic diseases have continued to be a major threat to global health and the economy. Developing countries are particularly vulnerable due to agricultural expansions and domestication of animals with humans. Scientifically sound clinical trials are important to find better ways to prevent, diagnose, and treat zoonotic diseases, while there is a lack of evidence to inform the clinical trials' capacity and practice in countries highly affected with the diseases. This study aimed to investigate expert scientists' perceptions and experiences in conducting clinical trials toward zoonotic diseases in Ethiopia. Methods: This study employed a descriptive, qualitative study design. It included major academic and research institutions in Ethiopia that had active engagements in veterinary and public health researches. It included the National Veterinary Institute, the National Animal Health Diagnostic and Investigation Center, the College of Veterinary Medicine at Addis Ababa University, the Ethiopian Public Health Institute, the Armauer Hansen Research Institute, and the College of Health Sciences at Addis Ababa University. In-depth interviews were conducted with expert scientists. Data were collected from October 2019 to April 2020. Data analysis was undertaken using open code 4.03 for qualitative data analysis. Results: Five major themes, with 18 sub-themes, emerged from the in-depth interviews. These were: challenges in the prevention, control, and treatment of zoonotic diseases; One Health approach to mitigate zoonotic diseases; personal and institutional experiences in conducting clinical trials on zoonotic diseases; barriers in conducting clinical trials toward zoonotic diseases; and strategies that promote conducting clinical trials on zoonotic diseases. Conducting clinical trials on zoonotic diseases in Ethiopia is hampered by a lack of clearly articulated ethics and regulatory frameworks, trial experts, financial resources, and good governance. Conclusion: In Ethiopia, conducting clinical trials on zoonotic diseases deserves due attention. Strengthening institutional and human resources capacity is a pre-condition to harness effective implementation of clinical trials on zoonotic diseases in the country. In Ethiopia where skilled human resource is scarce, One Health approach has the potential to form multidisciplinary teams to systematically improve clinical trials capacity and outcomes in the country.","Belay, Senait; Giday, Mirutse; Manyazewal, Tsegahun",Front Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8047130/,424

Student perceptions of a free online access medical education platform as an adjunct to the traditional undergraduate curriculum during lockdown,2021-04-08,"Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a very well-established and effective treatment for patients with extrapyramidal diseases. Despite its generally favorable clinical efficacy, some undesirable outcomes associated with DBS have been reported. Among such complications are incidences of suicidal ideation (SI) and behavior (SB) in patients undergoing this neurosurgical procedure. However, causal associations between DBS and increased suicide risk are not demonstrated and they constitute a debated issue. In light of these observations, the main objective of this work is to provide a comprehensive and unbiased overview of the literature on suicide risk in patients who received subthalamic nucleus (STN) and internal part of globus pallidum (GPi) DBS treatment. Additionally, putative mechanisms that might be involved in the development of SI and SB in these patients as well as caveats associated with these hypotheses are introduced. Finally, we briefly propose some clinical implications, including therapeutic strategies addressing these potential disease mechanisms. While a mechanistic connection between DBS and suicidality remains a controversial topic that requires further investigation, it is of critical importance to consider suicide risk as an integral component of candidate selection and post-operative care in DBS.","Costanza, Alessandra; Radomska, Michalina; Bondolfi, Guido; Zenga, Francesco; Amerio, Andrea; Aguglia, Andrea; Serafini, Gianluca; Amore, Mario; Berardelli, Isabella; Pompili, Maurizio; Nguyen, Khoa D.",Front Integr Neurosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8060445/,424

This study reports 30-day mortality and pulmonary complication rates in patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: This international, multicentre, cohort study at 235 hospitals in 24 countries included all patients undergoing surgery who had SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed within 7 days before or 30 days after surgery. The primary outcome measure was 30-day postoperative mortality. The secondary outcome measure was pulmonary complications (pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, or unexpected postoperative ventilation). FINDINGS: This analysis includes 1128 patients who had surgery between Jan 1 and March 31, 2020, of whom 835 (74·0%) had emergency surgery and 280 (24·8%) had elective surgery. 30-day mortality was 23·8% (268 of 1128). Pulmonary complications occurred in 577 (51·2%) of 1128 patients; 30-day mortality in these patients was 38·0% (219 of 577), accounting for 81·7% (219 of 268) of all deaths. In adjusted analyses, 30-day mortality was associated with male sex (odds ratio 1·75 [95% CI 1·28–2·40], p < 0·0001), age 70 years or older versus younger than 70 years (2·30 [1·65–3·22], p < 0·0001), American Society of Anesthesiologists grades 3–5 versus grades 1–2 (2·35 [1·57–3·53], p < 0·0001), malignant versus benign or obstetric diagnosis (1·55 [1·01–2·39], p = 0·046), emergency versus elective surgery (1·67 [1·06–2·63], p = 0·026), and major versus minor surgery (1·52 [1·01–2·31], p = 0·047). INTERPRETATION: Postoperative pulmonary complications occur in half of patients with perioperative SARS-CoV-2 infection and are associated with high mortality. Thresholds for surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic should be higher than normal practice, particularly in men aged 70 years and older.","Lawday, Samuel; Trout, Isobel",BJS Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8030204/,424
52629,Canadian Conference on Medical Education 2021 Abstracts,2021-04-30,"Orthopedic device-related infections remain a serious challenge to treat. Central to these infections are bacterial biofilms that form on the orthopedic implant itself. These biofilms shield the bacteria from the host immune system and most common antibiotic drugs, which renders them essentially antibiotic-tolerant. There is an urgent clinical need for novel strategies to prevent these serious infections that do not involve conventional antibiotics. Recently, a novel antibiofilm coating for titanium surfaces was developed based on 5-(4-bromophenyl)-N-cyclopentyl-1-octyl-1H-imidazol-2-amine as an active biofilm inhibitor. In the current study we present an optimized coating protocol that allowed for a 5-fold higher load of this active compound, whilst shortening the manufacturing process. When applied to titanium disks, the newly optimized coating was resilient to the most common sterilization procedures and it induced a 1 log reduction in biofilm cells of a clinical Staphylococcus aureus isolate (JAR060131) in vitro, without affecting the planktonic phase. Moreover, the antibiofilm effect of the coating in combination with the antibiotic cefuroxime was higher than cefuroxime treatment alone. Furthermore, the coating was successfully applied to a human-scale fracture fixation device resulting in a loading that was comparable to the titanium disk model. Finally, an in vivo biocompatibility and healing study in a rabbit osteotomy model indicated that these coated implants did not negatively affect fracture healing or osteointegration. These findings put our technology one step closer to clinical trials, confirming its potential in fighting orthopedic infections without compromising healing.","Coppola, Guglielmo Attilio; Onsea, Jolien; Moriarty, T.

54523,Response to reviews of Containing Contagion by Sara E. Davies,2021-05-17,"Although malaria is one of the oldest and most widely distributed diseases affecting humans, identifying and characterizing its presence in ancient human remains continue to challenge researchers. We attempted to establish a reliable approach to detecting malaria in human skeletons using multiple avenues of analysis: macroscopic observations, rapid diagnostic tests, and shotgun-capture sequencing techniques, to identify pathological changes, Plasmodium antigens, and Plasmodium DNA, respectively. Bone and tooth samples from ten individuals who displayed skeletal lesions associated with anaemia, from a site in southern Egypt (third to sixth centuries AD), were selected. Plasmodium antigens were detected in five of the ten bone samples, and traces of Plasmodium aDNA were detected in six of the twenty bone and tooth samples. There was relatively good synchronicity between the biomolecular findings, despite not being able to authenticate the results. This study highlights the complexity and limitations in the conclusive identification of the Plasmodium parasite in ancient human skeletons. Limitations regarding antigen and aDNA preservation and the importance of sample selection are at the forefront of the search for malaria in the past. We confirm that, currently, palaeopathological changes such as cribra orbitalia are not enough to be certain of the presence of malaria. While biomolecular methods are likely the best chance for conclusive identification, we were unable to obtain results which correspond to the current authentication criteria of biomolecules. This study represents an important contribution in the refinement of biomolecular techniques used; also, it raises new insight regarding the consistency of combining several approaches in the identification of malaria in past populations.

Following that, we surveyed 1,329 Sub-Saharan African female Instagram users to investigate the mediating role of consumer satisfaction concerning the relationships between perceived usefulness, enjoyment and intentions to follow and recommend brands’ Instagram accounts and their invariance across three generations. We tested hypotheses using the Partial-Least-Squares Structural Equation Modelling and conducted emotion and sentiment analyses. We found that satisfaction fully translates the positivity of usefulness and enjoyments into higher intention to follow and recommend amongst the female Instagram users surveyed. Usefulness effects on satisfaction are more intense amongst Generation X. However, Generation Z developed a stronger intention to follow. Generations Y and Z are more likely to recommend than Generation X based on a positive experience. Satisfaction is a stronger transmitter of usefulness indirect effects onto following intentions amongst Generation X than its descendants who express intention to recommend due to indirect enjoyment effects conveyed via satisfaction.

Research suggests that dietary supplement advertising may lead consumers to make inappropriate health-related decisions, to express behaviors such as overdosing, and to neglect healthy lifestyle behaviors. We conducted a content analysis of video advertisements for dietary supplements and described the content of advertisements with high numbers and frequent views. We analyzed 82 video advertisements on YouTube that promoted fat-reduction effects. We extracted 22 themes and classified them into 10 categories. The categories with the highest numbers of advertisements were “Exemption” (i.e., consuming the product frees the audience from refraining from binge eating) (20 ads, 24.4%) and “Health Concerns” (i.e., the product intake solves the health concerns of the audience) (19 ads, 23.2%). These advertisements may stimulate negative audience attitudes toward appropriate health behaviors. The category with the most frequent views was “Lifestyle” (i.e., adding product intake to a healthy lifestyle) (3,035,298 views). “Lifestyle” advertisements portray physical activity in a positive light and may promote appropriate health behaviors in the audience.

For people without a home, this advice is rather more difficult to follow. In this article, we use daily data describing the movements of 36,855 unique individuals who used emergency homeless shelters in Calgary over the period 1 January 2014–31 December 2019. We show that the use of emergency shelters is characterized by large flows from and into the broader community and smaller flows between individual shelters. Between admissions of new people into the shelter system and multiple re-admissions of current clients, there were an average of 43,613 movements between the community and between shelters each month. The size of these flows provide a measure of the extent to which people reliant on homeless shelters are exposed to the risk of transmission of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). By identifying the size and nature of these flows, we hope our analysis helps identify responses that may minimize this population’s risk of exposure.","Jadidzadeh, Ali; Kneebone, Ron",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8231070/,424
55207,Pandemic and Partisan Polarisation: Voter Evaluation of UK Government Handling During Covid‐19,2021-05-06,"The novel coronavirus infection has substantially increased over the last year causing a global pandemic. The rate of infection is persistently rising which has forced many authorities to promote stay at home orders. Individuals may experience an increase in anxiety due to spending longer durations at home, working from home, lacking direct social interactions with friends and family, monetary losses, and potentially getting infected from the virus. Increased anxiety for prolonged periods is linked to elevated blood pressure, heart attacks, and strokes. To evaluate the influence of the pandemic on psychological health, we conducted a study on effects of mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR) and stress management education (SME). To analyze the effects of the pandemic on mental health of our participants, we compared a group which was not affected by the pandemic (NPG) to a group that was affected by the pandemic (PG). The primary aim of this study was to compare the effects of 8‐weeks active intervention of MBSR and SME in NPG and PG on state‐trait anxiety and decentering. 36 adults participated in the study. All the participants were randomly enrolled in either 8‐weeks of MBSR or SME training. The NPG had 19 participants with 10 in MBSR and 9 in the SME group. The PG had 17 participants with 8 in MBSR and 9 in SME group. The MBSR group had weekly group sessions of ~2.5h on body scanning, meditation and light yoga while the SME group had concurrent sessions on nutrition, sleep, and stress management. Both the groups also did home practice daily for ~45 minutes. The NPG met in person for each of the 8 weeks, but the PG completed the last 4‐weeks of the course online due to a stay‐at‐home mandate at the time in Michigan. All the participants filled out a questionnaire on state anxiety, trait anxiety and decentering before and after the 8‐weeks. A ReANOVA was used to compare the differences across the 8 weeks, with condition (PG vs. NPG) as a between‐subjects factor. The results showed that there was a significant increase in decentering in PG after the 8‐weeks (treatment x condition and time x condition both p<0.03). The SME participants (Δ5.6±1.5 a.u., p=0.007) and MBSR participants (Δ3.5±0.7 a.u., p=0.002) significantly improved their ability to decenter during the pandemic. State anxiety did not change across the 8‐weeks of SME or MBSR in either the NPG or PG. Trait anxiety was reduced across the 8‐week intervention groups (time p=0.043) with MBSR participants decreasing by (Δ3.4±2.8 a.u.) and SME participants decreasing by (Δ0.9±1.7 a.u.). In this small cohort of adults, the 8‐week MBSR and SME interventions helped to reduce trait anxiety, and significantly improved the ability to decenter (disconnect from emotions) during the global pandemic. In addition, there was not an increase in state‐anxiety during the pandemic, which may be at least partially due to active participation in MBSR and SME. These are encouraging results that indicate MBSR and SME can positively influence psychological health, and to help disconnect from emotions during an unprecedented global health crisis.","Vyas, Aditi; Petushek, Erich; Morin, Brigitte; Durocher, John",FASEB J,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8239593/,424

Under such international situations, Japan and India should cooperate to initiate consideration of the regional order now. To establish such an order for the future, ends and means carry an importance. The ends should be the creation of a free, open, inclusive and democratic Indo-Pacific. The means should be some mechanisms based on principles of multilateralism, for example, Quad-Plus, not only involving the four countries: like-minded countries should also be included. In this way, we can find a silver lining beyond COVID-19. JEL Codes: F5, I19","Horimoto, Takenori",,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8263385/,424

Accessibility, however, is limited for some groups such as the elderly or patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). We explore the potential of fully immersive video games as a rehabilitation tool in PD patients. Four patients with mild-moderate PD (3 males:1 female, 53–71 years) participated in the study. Training consisted in two immersive virtual reality video gaming sessions. Outcomes were evaluated using System Usability Scale (SUS), Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ), Game Experience Questionnaire-post game (GEQ), an ad hoc satisfaction questionnaire and perceived effort. All participants completed the sessions without adverse effects (100%), without SSQ symptoms reported. Post-gaming SUS was >75% in both sessions (range 75–80%). Post-gaming GEQ scores were 3.3–4.0/4 in both sessions. Immersive virtual reality video gaming is feasible in patients with mild-moderate PD, with positive usability and patient satisfaction, and no adverse effects.","Campo-Prieto, Pablo; Rodríguez-Fuentes, Gustavo; Cancela-Carral, José Mª",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8309850/,424

Based on artificial intelligence technology, this paper studies 52 years of coastal rainfall and analyzes the characteristics of rainfall pattern by observing the latest meteorological observation data in southern China from 1969 to 2020. Based on the analysis of rain patterns in South China, it is found that only 8% of the annual precipitation in a southern region of China has a significant increasing trend. The monthly trend showed the most obvious downward and upward trend in April and November. Finally, by analyzing the results of artificial intelligence research, we can create a model of global cultural communication system based on artificial intelligence application. The logic model combines the elements of power, system, service and research framework knowledge, and puts forward the idea of system optimization based on artificial intelligence application to solve subsystem problems; For the service subsystem, artificial intelligence should be used to strengthen the supply and demand of services; For knowledge subsystem, artificial intelligence is needed to improve education and training skills, including knowledge service skills and knowledge management skills. The global cultural communication system must use artificial intelligence to improve the synergy of subsystems. Through the analysis of coastal rainfall pattern and the study of global cultural communication based on artificial intelligence, this paper applies it to cultural communication and promotes the development of global cultural communication.","Huaping, Liang",Arab J Geosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8363239/,424
57040,Advocating for the Use of Restorative Justice Practices: Examining the Overlap between Restorative Justice and Behavior Analysis,2021-08-25,"Tampered multimedia content is being increasingly used in a broad range of cybercrime activities. The spread of fake news, misinformation, digital kidnapping, and ransomware-related crimes are amongst the most recurrent crimes in which manipulated digital photos and videos are the perpetrating and disseminating medium. Criminal investigation has been challenged in applying machine learning techniques to automatically distinguish between fake and genuine seized photos and videos. Despite the pertinent need for manual validation, easy-to-use platforms for digital forensics are essential to automate and facilitate the detection of tampered content and to help criminal investigators with their work. This paper presents a machine learning Support Vector Machines (SVM) based method to distinguish between genuine and fake multimedia files, namely digital photos and videos, which may indicate the presence of deepfake content. The method was implemented in Python and integrated as new modules in the widely used digital forensics application Autopsy. The implemented approach extracts a set of simple features resulting from the application of a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to digital photos and video frames. The model was evaluated with a large dataset of classified multimedia files containing both legitimate and fake photos and frames extracted from videos. Regarding deepfake detection in videos, the Celeb-DFv1 dataset was used, featuring 590 original videos collected from YouTube, and covering different subjects. The results obtained with the 5-fold cross-validation outperformed those SVM-based methods documented in the literature, by achieving an average F1-score of [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] , and [Formula: see text] , respectively for photos, videos, and a mixture of both types of content. A benchmark with state-of-the-art methods was also done, by comparing the proposed SVM method with deep learning approaches, namely Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Despite CNN having outperformed the proposed DFT-SVM compound method, the competitiveness of the results attained by DFT-SVM and the substantially reduced processing time make it appropriate to be implemented and embedded into Autopsy modules, by predicting the level of fakeness calculated for each analyzed multimedia file.","Ferreira, Sara; Antunes, Mário; Correia, Manuel E.",J Imaging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8321380/,424

58059,COVID-19 crisis: Applying the principles of lean manufacture within a Hemodialysis Unit(),2021-09-24,"In tourism-dependent cities, investigating the spatiotemporal distribution and dynamics of tourist flows is crucial for better urban planning in both steady and perturbed states. In recent years, researchers have started relying more on photo-based, geotagged social data, which offer insights about tourists, popular hotspots, and mobility patterns. However, distinguishing between tourists and locals from this data is problematic since residence information is often not provided. While previous studies rely on heuristic (e.g., period of stay) and probabilistic (Shannon entropy) approaches, this paper proposes a method for classifying tourists and residents based on machine learning (ML) algorithms and considering parameters that could explain the variability between the two (e.g., weather, mobility, and photo content). This approach was applied to Flickr users’ geotagged photos taken in Tokyo’s 23 special wards from July 2008 to December 2019. The results show that stacked ensemble (SE) models are superior to models based on five supervised-learning algorithms, including gradient boosting machine (GBM), generalized linear model (GLM), distributed random forest (DRF), deep learning (DL), and extremely randomized trees (XRT). Temporal entropy (TEN), mobility on workdays, and frequent visits to amusement venues and crowded places influenced how users were classified. While temporal distribution showed similar monthly/hourly patterns, spatial distribution varied. The proposed approach might pave the way for scholars to carry out future tourism research on different topics and subsequently support policymakers in the decision-making process, specifically in urban settings.","Derdouri, Ahmed; Osaragi, Toshihiro",Inf Technol Tourism,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8449224/,424
58060,The Role of Social Media in an Inspirational Approach to Product Design and Designer Performance,2021-09-09,"BACKGROUND: The World Health Organization (WHO) aims to achieve global hepatitis C elimination by 2030, defined as diagnosis of 90% of infected individuals and treating 80% of them. Current guidelines for the screening and diagnosis of hepatitis C infection denote using a relatively cheap screen with anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody immunoassay, followed by the much costlier molecular test for HCV RNA levels using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to confirm active HCV infection. Simplification of the HCV evaluation algorithm to reduce the number of required tests could considerably expand the provision of HCV treatment especially in a developing country. This study investigates the performance of hepatitis C Core Antigen (HCV Ag) test by comparing HCV Ag results versus the results obtained with HCV ribonucleic acid (RNA) PCR which is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of HCV infection. RESULTS: Among the 109 anti-HCV positive sera, 96 were positive for both HCV Ag (> 3 fmol/L) and HCV RNA (> 15 IU/mL); 8 were negative for both tests, while the remaining 5 were positive for HCV RNA only. Considering the HCV RNA as gold standard; the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of HCV Ag test were found to be 95.05%, 100%, 100%, and 61.54%, respectively. HCV genotype was performed for 59 patients. The most common HCV genotype was genotype 1 (72.9%). Genotype 2 (15.3%) and genotype 3 (11.9%) were detected in the others samples. A high level of correlation was seen between HCV RNA and HCV Ag (r = 0.958, p < 0.001). The correlation for the samples that were genotyped 1 was significant (r = 0.966, p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: In our study, it was found that there was strong correlation between HCV RNA levels and HCV Ag levels. So, it can be used for a one-step HCV antigen test to diagnose active HCV infection.","Kallala, Ouafa; Kacem, Saoussen; Fodha, Imene; Pozzetto, Bruno; Abdelhalim, Trabelsi",Egypt Liver Journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8449518/,424

Therefore, our research aimed to screen the genotypic frequencies of the very important pharmacogenomics (VIP) mutations and determined the differences between Lahu and the other 11 populations. METHODS: Agena MassARRAY (AgenaMassARRAY) single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping technique was used to detect 81 VIP mutations of pharmacogenomics genes in Lahu, and their genotypic frequencies were compared with the other major 11 populations. Chi-square tests were used to identify different loci among these populations. Finally, the genetic structure and pairwise Fst values of Lahu and the other 11 populations were analyzed. RESULTS: We found that the distribution of allele frequencies within different pharmacogenes in Lahu showed significantly different with other populations. Additionally, the pairwise F-statistics (Fst) values and genetic structure revealed the variants in the Lahu population as well were mostly related to the Han Chinese in Beijing, China (CHB) and the Japanese population in Tokyo, Japan (JPT) genetically.

SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic that has led to millions of deaths, belongs to the genus beta-coronavirus. Alpha- and beta-coronaviruses encode a unique protein, nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1) that both suppresses host immune responses and reduces global gene expression levels in the host cells. As a key pathogenicity factor of coronaviruses, Nsp1 redirects the host translation machinery to increase synthesis of viral proteins. Through multiple mechanisms, coronaviruses impede host protein expression through Nsp1, while escaping inhibition to allow the translation of viral RNA. In this review, we discuss current data about suppression of the immune responses and inhibition of protein synthesis induced by coronavirus Nsp1, as well as the prospect of live-attenuated vaccine development with virulence-attenuated viruses with mutations in Nsp1.","Yuan, Shuai; Balaji, Shravani; Lomakin, Ivan B.; Xiong, Yong",Front Microbiol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8512706/,424

The results are based on the MI analysis of pair contact correlations measured in steered molecular dynamics (SMD) trajectories and their statistical dependence on global unfolding. This study is the first application of the MI analysis to SMD forced unfolding, and we furnish specific SMD recommendations for the utility of parameters and options in the TimeScapes package. The MI analysis provided a global overview of the effect of perturbation on the stability of the protein. We also employed a more conventional trajectory analysis for a detailed description of the mechanical resistance of Top7. Specifically, we investigated 1) the hydropathy of the interactions of structural segments, 2) the H(2)O concentration near residues relevant for unfolding, and 3) the changing hydrogen bonding patterns and main chain dihedral angles. The results show that the application of MI in the study of protein mechanical resistance can be useful for the engineering of more resistant mutants when combined with conventional analysis. We propose a novel mutation design based on the hydropathy of residues that would stabilize the unfolding region by mimicking its more stable symmetry mate. The proposed design process does not involve the introduction of covalent crosslinks, so it has the potential to preserve the conformational space and unfolding pathway of the protein.","Perišić, Ognjen; Wriggers, Willy",Front Mol Biosci,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8516001/,424

The SARS-CoV-2 virus has overtaken globe to economic and social lockdown. Many patients with COVID-19 have compromised immunity, especially in an aged population suffering from Parkinson disease (PD). Alteration in dopaminergic neurons or deficiency of dopamine in PD patients is the most common symptoms affecting 1% population above the age of 60 years. The compromised immune system and inflammatory manifestation in PD patients make them an easy target. The most common under trial drugs for COVID-19 are Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Azithromycin along with adjunct drugs like Amantadine with some monoclonal antibodies. Presently, clinically US FDA approved drugs in PD includes Levodopa, catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors, (Entacapone and Tolcapone), Dopamine agonists (Bromocriptine, Ropinirole, Pramipexole, and Rotigotine), Monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) inhibitors (Selegiline and Rasagiline), Amantadine and Antimuscarinic drugs. The drugs have established mechanism of action on PD patients with known pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetic properties along with dose and adverse effects. Conclusion and relevance of this review focus on the drugs that can be tried for the PD patients with SAR CoV-2 infection, in particular, Amantadine approved by all developed countries a common drug possessing both antiviral properties by downregulation of CTSL, lysosomal pathway disturbance and change in pH necessary to uncoat the viral proteins and antiParkinson properties.

We discuss the most recent evidence supporting this approach, and whether any of the associated risks should stop us adopting it as a default strategy. RECENT FINDINGS With the addition of injectable ofatumumab, and the two oral sphingosines one phosphate modulators siponimod and ozanimod, ten HE DMTs are now available for pwMS, though variation in licensing status and cost may limit their use in some healthcare environments. Real World evidence based on large MS registry data suggests the superiority of early HE DMT over a slow treatment escalation approach; delaying HE DMT leads to more rapid and often irreversible disability accrual. Mechanistically, B-cell depletion, particularly memory B-cell suppression, is a common denominator closely associated with DMT efficacy. SUMMARY The concept that HE DMTs are necessarily associated with a high risk of adverse effects, is no longer supported by the evidence. The rather predictable and manageable risk profile of most HE DMTs should lower the threshold for clinicians to discuss such treatment with pwMS as a first line approach.","Schmierer, Klaus; Sorensen, Per Soelberg; Baker, David",Current opinion in neurology,https://doi.org/10.1097/wco.0000000000000937; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33840776/,424

The aims were to study the acceptability rate of and overall patient satisfaction with an automatic sequential leg compression system and the short-term effectiveness of a combined VTE prevention modality. METHODS One-hundred and eighty-four consecutive patients undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy were postoperatively treated with enoxaparine and intermittent pneumatic compression of the thigh. By completing a questionnaire, the patients were prospectively studied to evaluate the comfort and tolerability of a compression device (SCD Response Compression System; Covidien, Gosport, UK). The patients were monitored for complications and development of VTE for up to 4 weeks postoperatively. The device used ensures customized and effective compression therapy matching the patient's individual vascular refill by sequential, gradient, circumferential microprocessor-controlled compression cycles. RESULTS No clinically evident VTE, critical bleeding or postoperative death occurred during the study period. Drain output was associated with transfusion requirement (p < 0.001), obesity (p < 0.02) and longer operation duration (p < 0.001). The sequential compression devices were well tolerated by 63% of the patients, in that the sleeves were judged as being pleasant (72%) and nonoppressive (79%). Patients reported bothersome insomnia (23%) and noise (44%), and early removal was required in 3%. CONCLUSIONS Combined mechanical and pharmacological thromboprophylaxis was highly effective, well tolerated, and safe. The device tested showed a high comfort and tolerability profile. The use of combined modalities for VTE prophylaxis is justified in patients at very high risk of VTE, such as those undergoing radical retropubic prostatectomy.","Cindolo, Luca; Salzano, Luigi; Mirone, Vincenzo; Imbimbo, Ciro; Longo, Nicola; Kakkos, Stavros K; Reddy, Daniel J",Urologia internationalis,https://doi.org/10.1159/000224861; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19641352/,424

These methods are recommended and frequently used for athlete monitoring, yet their uniformity has not been well assessed, and we have a limited understanding of their relationship with measures of training load. OBJECTIVE To investigate the applications and designs of single-item self-report measures used in monitoring team-sport athletes and present the relationship between these measures and measures of training load. DATA SOURCES PubMed, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus were searched between inception and March 2019. STUDY SELECTION Articles were included if they concerned adult athletes from field- or court-sport domains, if athlete well-being was measured using a single-item self-report, and if the relationship with a measure of modifiable training load was investigated over at least 7 days. DATA EXTRACTION Data related to participant characteristics, self-report measures, training load measures, and statistical analysis and outcomes were extracted by 2 authors (C.D. and C.D.). DATA SYNTHESIS A total of 21 studies were included in the analysis. A narrative synthesis was conducted. The measures used most frequently were muscle soreness, fatigue, sleep quality, stress, and mood. All measures presented various relationships with metrics of training load from no association to a very large association, and the associations were predominantly trivial to moderate in the studies with the largest numbers of observations. Relationships were largely negative associations. CONCLUSIONS The implications of this review should be considered by users in the application and clinical utility of single-item self-report measures in athlete monitoring. Great emphasis has been placed on examining the relationship between subjective and objective measures of training load. Although the relationship is still unclear, such an association may not be expected or useful. Researchers should consider the measurement properties of single-item self-report measures and seek to establish their relationship with clinically meaningful outcomes. As such, further study is required to inform practitioners on the appropriate objective application of data from single-item self-report measures.","Duignan, Ciara; Doherty, Cailbhe; Caulfield, Brian; Blake, Catherine",Journal of athletic training,https://doi.org/10.4085/1062-6050-0528.19; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32991706/,424

Type I interferons (IFN) α/β have been used clinically as antiviral therapy as the first line of defense against virus infections successfully for decades. However, treatment with type I interferons has not been effective in patients with EV71 infection. In this study, we found that in cells pretreated with IFN-β, EV71 infection could still lead to a cytopathic effect, and the viral replication was not affected. The mechanism by which EV71 antagonizes interferon signaling, however, has been controversial. Our study indicated that EV71 infection did not inhibit phosphorylation of STAT1/2 induced by IFN-β stimulation, but p-STAT1/2 transport into the nucleus was significantly blocked. We showed that EV71 infection reduced the formation of STAT/karyopherin-α1 (KPNA1) complex upon interferon stimulation and that the virus down-regulated the expression of KPNA1, a nuclear localization signal receptor for p-STAT1. Using specific caspase inhibitors and siRNA for caspase-3, we demonstrated that EV71 infection induced degradation of cellular KPNA1 in a caspase-3-dependent manner, which led to decreased induction of interferon-inducible genes and IFN response. Viral 2A and 3C proteases did not degrade KPNA1, inhibit the activity of ISRE or suppress the transcription of interferon-inducible genes induced by IFN-β. Our study demonstrates a novel mechanism by which antiviral signaling is suppressed through degradation of KPNA1 by activated caspase-3 induced in an enteroviral infection.","Wang, Chunyang; Sun, Menghuai; Yuan, Xinhui; Ji, Lianfu; Jin, Yu; Cardona, Carol J; Xing, Zheng",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m116.745729; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28455446/,424

However, little is known about the mechanism of Zscan4 underlying these processes of cell fate control. Here, we show that Zscan4f, a representative of ZSCAN proteins, is able to recruit Tet2 through its SCAN domain. The Zscan4f-Tet2 interaction promotes DNA demethylation and regulates the expression of target genes, particularly those encoding glycolytic enzymes and proteasome subunits. Zscan4f regulates metabolic rewiring, enhances proteasome function, and ultimately promotes iPSC generation. These results identify Zscan4f as an important partner of Tet2 in regulating target genes and promoting iPSC generation and suggest a possible and common mechanism shared by SCAN family transcription factors to recruit ten-eleven translocation (TET) DNA dioxygenases to regulate diverse cellular processes, including reprogramming.","Cheng, Zhou-Li; Zhang, Meng-Li; Lin, Huai-Peng; Gao, Chao; Song, Jun-Bin; Zheng, Zhihong; Li, Linpeng; Zhang, Yanan; Shen, Xiaoqi; Zhang, Hao; Huang, Zhenghui; Zhan, Wuqiang; Zhang, Cheng; Hu, Xu; Sun, Yi-Ping; Jiang, Lubing; Sun, Lei; Xu, Yanhui; Yang, Chen; Ge, Yuanlong; Zhao, Yong; Liu, Xingguo; Yang, Hui; Liu, Pengyuan; Guo, Xing; Guan, Kun-Liang; Xiong, Yue; Zhang, Mingliang; Ye, Dan",Cell reports,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2020.107877; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32668244/,424

In the present study, we systematically collected datasets on Norovirus outbreaks in Japan from 2005 to 2019 and analyzed time-dependent changes in the asymptomatic ratio, the probability of virus detection, and the probability of infection given exposure. Reports of 1,728 outbreaks were published, and feces from all involved individuals, including those with asymptomatic infection, were tested for virus in 434 outbreaks. We found that the outbreak size did not markedly change over this period, but the variance in outbreak size increased during the winter (November-April). Assuming that natural history parameters did not vary over time, the asymptomatic ratio, the probability of virus detection, and the probability of infection given exposure were estimated to be 18.6%, 63.3% and 84.5%, respectively. However, a model with time-varying natural history parameters yielded better goodness-of-fit and suggested that the asymptomatic ratio varied by year. The asymptomatic ratio was as high as 25.8% for outbreaks caused by genotype GII.4 noroviruses. We conclude that Norovirus transmissibility has not changed markedly since 2005, and that yearly variation in the asymptomatic ratio could potentially be explained by the circulating dominant genotype.","Misumi, Megumi; Nishiura, Hiroshi",PeerJ,https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.11769; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34306831/,424

Virtual Consumerism in 2021.,2021-02-01,"Modern burn care techniques have reduced the risk of infection of the acute burn wound, resulting in more rapid healing and a lower incidence of graft loss. Secondary breakdown may still occur. The loss of epithelium in association with multifocal superficial abscesses and ulceration has been termed burns impetigo. This may result in considerable morbidity and require prolonged treatment. The events preceding development, the impact on the patient, and the ideal treatment appear unclear and poorly reported. In 5 years, between 2006 and 2011, 406 pediatric burns were treated with skin grafts, with 7% developing burns impetigo. Time to resolution ranged from 5 to 241 days: the mean time to complete healing was greatest with conservative management (96 days), followed by antibacterial dressings (37 days), oral antibiotics (36 days), topical steroids (16 days), and oral antibiotics in combination with topical steroids (13.5 days). Burns impetigo resulted in significant morbidity, requiring multiple visits to the treatment center and prolonged symptoms. Delay in diagnosis and treatment resulted in worse outcomes. Prompt consideration of burns impetigo should occur when postgraft patients present with suggestive clinical signs and treatment with oral antibiotics plus topical steroids should be considered.","Aikins, Kimberly; Prasad, Narayan; Menon, Seema; Harvey, John G; Holland, Andrew J A",Journal of burn care & research : official publication of the American Burn Association,https://doi.org/10.1097/bcr.0000000000000070; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24823337/,424

METHODS A total of 40 adults [mean ± sd body mass index 36 ± 3 kg/m(2) , age 48 ± 9 years, glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) 9.7 ± 2%) undergoing bariatric surgery [Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG)] were enrolled in the present study, the Surgical Treatment and Medication Potentially Eradicate Diabetes Efficiently (STAMPEDE) trial. Type 2 diabetes remission was defined as HbA1c <6.5% and fasting glucose <126 mg/dl (i.e. <7 mmol/l) without antidiabetic medication. Indices of insulin secretion and sensitivity were calculated from plasma glucose, insulin and C-peptide values during a 120-min mixed-meal tolerance test. Body fat, incretins (glucagon-like polypeptide-1, gastric inhibitory peptide, ghrelin) and adipokines [adiponectin, leptin, tumour necrosis factor-α, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)] were also assessed. RESULTS At 24 months, 37 patients had available follow-up data (RYGB, n = 18; SG, n = 19). Bariatric surgery induced type 2 diabetes remission rates of 40 and 27% at 12 and 24 months, respectively. Total fat/abdominal fat loss, insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity and β-cell function (C-peptide0-120 /glucose0-120 × Matsuda index) improved more in those with remission at 12 and 24 months than in those without remission. Incretin levels were unrelated to type 2 diabetes remission, but, compared with those without remission, hs-CRP decreased and adiponectin increased more in those with remission. Only baseline adiponectin level predicted lower HbA1c levels at 12 and 24 months, and elevated adiponectin correlated with enhanced β-cell function, lower triglyceride levels and fat loss. CONCLUSIONS Smaller rises in adiponectin level, a mediator of insulin action and adipose mass, characterize type 2 diabetes non-remission up to 2 years after bariatric surgery. Adjunctive strategies promoting greater fat loss and/or raising adiponectin may be key to achieving higher type 2 diabetes remission rates after bariatric surgery.","Malin, S K; Bena, J; Abood, B; Pothier, C E; Bhatt, D L; Nissen, S; Brethauer, S A; Schauer, P R; Kirwan, J P; Kashyap, S R","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",https://doi.org/10.1111/dom.12376; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25132119/,424

AGEs (e.g. pentosidine or N-ε-carboxy-methyl-lysine [CML]) have been particularly investigated in patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease and have been associated not only with arteriosclerosis, but also with novel vascular events. On the contrary, the correlation of vascular events with AGEs has not been sufficiently investigated in groups excluding those with diabetes or chronic kidney disease. The present study aimed to evaluate the impact of AGEs on the history of vascular events in postmenopausal women excluding those with diabetes or renal insufficiency. METHODS Japanese postmenopausal women were registered to the study after obtaining informed consent. Patients with critical illness, including diabetes mellitus and renal insufficiency, were excluded from the study. Participants were asked about their medical histories during the registration for the Nagano Cohort Study. Non-fasting serum and urine samples were collected to measure biochemical markers, including urinary pentosidine and serum CML levels. RESULTS Among 357 postmenopausal women, 32 had a history of vascular events. After adjusting age and other variables known to be associated with the presence of vascular event history, positive correlations between AGEs and vascular event history were observed (standardized odds ratio of log[pentosidine] 1.38, 95% CI 0.96-2.00, P = 0.086; standardized odds ratio of log[CML] 1.73, 95% CI 1.10-2.74, P = 0.019).

We aimed to assess the incidence of GI bleeding and effects of SUP in these patients. METHODS We assessed GI bleeding in ICU patients receiving RRT at baseline (and at any time in the ICU) and effects of prophylactic pantoprazole versus placebo in the international SUP in the ICU (SUP-ICU) trial. All analyses were conducted according to a published protocol and statistical analysis plan. RESULTS Data of 3,291 acutely admitted adult ICU patients with one or more risk factors for GI bleeding randomized to pantoprazole or placebo intravenously once daily during ICU stay (until ICU discharge, death, or a maximum of 90 days) were analyzed. Some 20 out of 258 (7.8%, 95% CI 4.5-11.1%) and 52 out of 568 (9.2%, 95% CI 6.8-11.6%) of the patients receiving RRT at baseline and at any time in ICU, respectively, developed clinically important GI bleeding in the ICU. We did not observe statistically significant differences in the intervention effect (pantoprazole vs. placebo) in the proportion of patients with clinically important GI bleeding, clinically important events, infectious adverse events, use of interventions to stop GI bleeding, or 90-day mortality in patients with versus without RRT at baseline. CONCLUSIONS In adult ICU patients receiving RRT at baseline, we observed high incidences of clinically important GI bleeding, but did not observe effects of pantoprazole versus placebo in this subgroup.","Schefold, Joerg C; Krag, Mette; Marker, Søren; Perner, Anders; Wetterslev, Jørn; Wise, Matt P; Borthwick, Mark; Bendel, Stepani; Keus, Frederik; Guttormsen, Anne Berit; Lange, Theis; Møller, Morten Hylander",American journal of nephrology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000502732; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480045/,424

STUDY DESIGN Institutional ACS-NSQIP data were used to identify patients who underwent elective CRS from September 2006 to March 2013. The cohort was stratified into 3 groups relative to implementation of the ERP (February 1, 2010) and SSIB (July 1, 2011). Unadjusted characteristics and 30-day outcomes were assessed, and inverse proportional weighting was then used to determine the adjusted effect of these programs. RESULTS There were 787 patients included: 337, 165, and 285 in the pre-ERP/SSIB, post-ERP/pre-SSIB, and post-ERP/SSIB periods, respectively. After inverse probability weighting (IPW) adjustment, groups were balanced with respect to patient and procedural characteristics considered. Compared with the pre-ERP/SSIB group, the post-ERP/pre-SSIB group had significantly reduced length of hospitalization (8.3 vs 6.6 days, p = 0.01) but did not differ with respect to postoperative wound complications and sepsis. Subsequent introduction of the SSIB then resulted in a significant decrease in superficial SSI (16.1% vs 6.3%, p < 0.01) and postoperative sepsis (11.2% vs 1.8%, p < 0.01). Finally, inflation-adjusted mean hospital cost for a CRS admission fell from $31,926 in 2008 to $22,044 in 2013 (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS Sequential implementation of the ERP and SSIB provided incremental improvements in CRS outcomes while controlling hospital costs, supporting their combined use as an effective strategy toward improving the quality of patient care.","Keenan, Jeffrey E; Speicher, Paul J; Nussbaum, Daniel P; Adam, Mohamed Abdelgadir; Miller, Timothy E; Mantyh, Christopher R; Thacker, Julie K M",Journal of the American College of Surgeons,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamcollsurg.2015.04.008; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26206639/,424

More recently, concerns have been raised regarding the safety of mesh procedures. Mesh can be inserted vaginally, laparoscopically or via an open abdominal route, but there are few data comparing the outcomes. Most previous published data relate to small numbers of procedures. METHODS This was a review of data submitted to the British Society of Urogynaecology (BSUG) database of all cases reporting the use of mesh placed vaginally or abdominally (open or laparoscopic) between January 2006 and December 2016. The primary outcome was based on the reported patient global impression of improvement (PGI-I). RESULTS A total of 6,709 cases of mesh prolapse repair were entered during the study period. Women in the laparoscopic group had a lower BMI and were younger. Significantly more patients in the open group (96.4%) described themselves as very much better or much better compared with the laparoscopic group (91%) and the vaginal mesh group (90.7%; p < 0.001). Only 0.5% of patients reported that they were worse or very much worse. CONCLUSIONS This dataset suggests that the effectiveness of mesh repair might be good regardless of the route of insertion.

81021,Exploring healthcare graduates' conceptualisations of preparedness for practice: a longitudinal qualitative research study.,2021-02-22,"INTRODUCTION Clinician burnout is widespread throughout medicine, affecting professionalism, communication, and increases the risk of medical errors, thus impacting safe quality patient care. Previous studies have shown Peer Support Programs (PSPs) promote workforce wellness by supporting clinicians during times of heightened stress and vulnerability. Although these programs have been implemented in large institutions, they have not been used in military hospitals, which have high staff turnover and added stressors of deployments. MATERIALS AND METHODS In December 2018, 50 physicians received 5 hours of PSP training at a military hospital from a nationally recognized PSP expert, following the programmatic structure described by Shapiro and Galowitz (2016). Utilization of the program was tracked from December 2018 to December 2019, recording only classification of provider type, triggering event, and provider specialty to maintain confidentiality. Qualitative comments from recipients and supporters were saved anonymously for quality improvement purposes. RESULTS In the first year of our PSP, 254 clinicians (102 [40.2%] residents/fellows, 91 [35.8%] staff physicians, 4 [1.6%] medical students, 35 [13.8%] nurses, 22 [8.7%] allied health) received 1:1 peer support. Primary specialties utilizing peer support included 135 (52.9%) medical, 59 (23.2%) surgical, 43 (16.9%) obstetric, and 18 (7.1%) pediatric. Patient death (25%), risk management notification (22%), medical error/complication (15%), and poor patient outcome (13%) were the most common events triggering peer support. Peer support was provided at 8 locations across the continental United States with universally positive comments from recipients. CONCLUSIONS Implementation of a PSP at our institution led to rapid utilization across multiple hospitals in the military health system, a model that could easily expand to deployed settings and remote locations. Access to peer support across the military health system could both mitigate the increased risks of military clinician burnout, and improve patient safety, healthcare worker resilience, and service member readiness.","Keyser, Erin A; Weir, Larissa F; Valdez, Michelle M; Aden, James K; Matos, Renée I",Military medicine,https://doi.org/10.1093/milmed/usaa225; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32830273/,424
82274,Meritocratic and Fair? The discourse of UK and Australia's widening participation policies.,2020-12-21,"Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is increasingly being applied in clinical laboratories for unbiased culture-independent diagnosis. Whether it can be a next routine pathogen identification tool has become a topic of concern. We review the current implementation of this new technology for infectious disease diagnostics and discuss the feasibility of transforming mNGS into a routine diagnostic test. Since 2008, numerous studies from over 20 countries have revealed the practicality of mNGS in the work-up of undiagnosed infectious diseases. mNGS performs well in identifying rare, novel, difficult-to-detect and coinfected pathogens directly from clinical samples and presents great potential in resistance prediction by sequencing the antibiotic resistance genes, providing new diagnostic evidence that can be used to guide treatment options and improve antibiotic stewardship. Many physicians recognized mNGS as a last resort method to address clinical infection problems. Although several hurdles, such as workflow validation, quality control, method standardisation, and data interpretation, remain before mNGS can be implemented routinely in clinical laboratories, they are temporary and can be overcome by rapidly evolving technologies. With more validated workflows, lower cost and turnaround time, and simplified interpretation criteria, mNGS will be widely accepted in clinical practice. Overall, mNGS is transforming the landscape of clinical microbiology laboratories, and to ensure that it is properly utilised in clinical diagnosis, both physicians and microbiologists should have a thorough understanding of the power and limitations of this method.","Han, Dongsheng; Li, Ziyang; Li, Rui; Tan, Ping; Zhang, Rui; Li, Jinming",Critical reviews in microbiology,https://doi.org/10.1080/1040841x.2019.1681933; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691607/,424
82322,The UCL 'Preparation for Practice' teaching programme.,2020-09-03,"UNLABELLED Myd88 signaling is critical to the control of numerous central nervous system (CNS) infections by promoting both innate and adaptive immune responses. Nevertheless, the extent to which Myd88 regulates type I interferon (IFN) versus proinflammatory factors and T cell function, as well as the anatomical site of action, varies extensively with the pathogen. CNS infection by neurotropic coronavirus with replication confined to the brain and spinal cord induces protective IFN-α/β via Myd88-independent activation of melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5). However, a contribution of Myd88-dependent signals to CNS pathogenesis has not been assessed. Infected Myd88(-/-) mice failed to control virus, exhibited enhanced clinical disease coincident with increased demyelination, and succumbed to infection within 3 weeks. The induction of IFN-α/β, as well as of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, was impaired early during infection. However, defects in both IFN-α/β and select proinflammatory factors were rapidly overcome prior to T cell recruitment. Myd88 deficiency also specifically blunted myeloid and CD4 T cell recruitment into the CNS without affecting CD8 T cells. Moreover, CD4 T cells but not CD8 T cells were impaired in IFN-γ production. Ineffective virus control indeed correlated most prominently with reduced antiviral IFN-γ in the CNS of Myd88(-/-) mice. The results demonstrate a crucial role for Myd88 both in early induction of innate immune responses during coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis and in specifically promoting protective CD4 T cell activation. In the absence of these responses, functional CD8 T cells are insufficient to control viral spread within the CNS, resulting in severe demyelination. IMPORTANCE During central nervous system (CNS) infections, signaling through the adaptor protein Myd88 promotes both innate and adaptive immune responses. The extent to which Myd88 regulates antiviral type I IFN, proinflammatory factors, adaptive immunity, and pathology is pathogen dependent. These results reveal that Myd88 protects from lethal neurotropic coronavirus-induced encephalomyelitis by accelerating but not enhancing the induction of IFN-α/β, as well as by promoting peripheral activation and CNS accumulation of virus-specific CD4 T cells secreting IFN-γ. By controlling both early innate immune responses and CD4 T cell-mediated antiviral IFN-γ, Myd88 signaling limits the initial viral dissemination and is vital for T cell-mediated control of viral loads. Uncontrolled viral replication in the absence of Myd88 leads to severe demyelination and pathology despite overall reduced inflammatory responses. These data support a vital role of Myd88 signaling in protective antimicrobial functions in the CNS by promoting proinflammatory mediators and T cell-mediated IFN-γ production.","Butchi, Niranjan; Kapil, Parul; Puntambekar, Shweta; Stohlman, Stephen A; Hinton, David R; Bergmann, Cornelia C",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01199-15; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26136579/,424
82638,Physiotherapy students can be educated to portray realistic patient roles in simulation: a pragmatic observational study.,2020-11-26,"Persistent inward currents are important to motoneuron excitability and firing behaviors, and also have been implicated in excitotoxicity. In particular, L-type Ca2+ channels, usually located on motoneuron dendrites, play a primary role in amplification of synaptic inputs. However, recent experimental findings on L-type Ca2+ channel behaviors challenge some fundamental assumptions that have been used in interpreting experimental and computational modeling data. Thus, the objectives of this study were to incorporate recent experimental data into an updated, high-fidelity computational model in order to explain apparent inconsistencies, and to better elucidate the spatial distributions, expression patterns, and functional roles of L-type Ca2+ and SKL channels. Specifically, the updated model incorporated asymmetric channel activation/deactivation kinetics, depolarization-dependent facilitation, randomness in channel gating, and coactivation of SKL channels. Our simulation results suggest that L-type Ca2+ and SKL channels co-localize primarily on distal dendrites of motoneurons, in a punctate expression. Also, punctate expression, as opposed to a homogenous expression, provides high synaptic current amplification, limits bistability and firing rates, and robustly regulates the Ca2+ persistent inward current, thereby reducing risk of excitotoxicity. The hysteresis and bistability observed experimentally in current/voltage and frequency/current relationships result from the L-type Ca2+ channels' distal location and intrinsic warm-up. Accordingly, our results indicate that punctate expression of L-type Ca2+ and SKL channels is a potent mechanism for regulating excitability, which would provide a strong neuroprotective effect. Our results could provide broader insights into the functional significance of warm-up and punctate expression of ion channels to regulation of cell excitability.","Mousa, Mohamed H; Elbasiouny, Sherif M",Journal of neurophysiology,https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00169.2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32937080/,424

This study examines its prevalence and correlates among HCWs in Karnataka State, India. HCWs who attended a workshop to improve mental health well-being during COVID-19 completed an anonymous online questionnaire. In addition to socio-demographics, domains assessed include occupational characteristics, COVID-19 related concerns, anxiety/depression, substance use, suicidality, lifestyle and family functioning. Of the 3083 HCWs who completed the survey (response rate-51.4 %), anxiety disorder and depression was highest among those with frontline COVID-19 responsibilities (anxiety disorder-26.6 %, depression-23.8 %). Prevalence was significantly higher among those with clinical responsibilities compared to those with supportive responsibilities (anxiety disorder: 23.9 % vs 15.5 %), (depression: 20.0 % vs 14.2 %). In the backward step-wise logistic regression analysis, HCWs with anxiety disorder were more likely to be doctors/nurses/hospital assistants, older, female, unmarried, without a leisure activity, report increased alcohol use and suicidal thoughts after pandemic onset, and having a history of receiving mental health interventions. Participants with depression additionally had family distress and hardly ever exercised. To conclude, mental health issues are common among HCWs in India. Interventions need to ensure that HCWs are protected from mental health consequences of working in COVID-19 treatment settings.","Parthasarathy, Rajani; Ts, Jaisoorya; K, Thennarasu; Murthy, Pratima",Asian journal of psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2021.102626; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33721830/,424

Academics and practitioners alike have asked why people share such misinformation, and sought solutions to reduce the sharing of misinformation5-7. Here, we attempt to address both of these questions. First, we find that the veracity of headlines has little effect on sharing intentions, despite having a large effect on judgments of accuracy. This dissociation suggests that sharing does not necessarily indicate belief. Nonetheless, most participants say it is important to share only accurate news. To shed light on this apparent contradiction, we carried out four survey experiments and a field experiment on Twitter; the results show that subtly shifting attention to accuracy increases the quality of news that people subsequently share. Together with additional computational analyses, these findings indicate that people often share misinformation because their attention is focused on factors other than accuracy-and therefore they fail to implement a strongly held preference for accurate sharing. Our results challenge the popular claim that people value partisanship over accuracy8,9, and provide evidence for scalable attention-based interventions that social media platforms could easily implement to counter misinformation online.","Pennycook, Gordon; Epstein, Ziv; Mosleh, Mohsen; Arechar, Antonio A; Eckles, Dean; Rand, David G",Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03344-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33731933/,424

85040,Association between antibiotics and gut microbiome dysbiosis in children: systematic review and meta-analysis.,2021,"BACKGROUND Measuring and monitoring progress towards Millennium Development Goals (MDG) 4 and 5 required valid and reliable estimates of maternal and child mortality. In South Africa, there are conflicting reports on the estimates of maternal and neonatal mortality, derived from both direct and indirect estimation techniques. This study aimed to systematically review the estimates made of maternal and neonatal mortality in the period from 1990 to 2015 in South Africa and determine trends over this period. METHODS Nationally-representative studies reporting on maternal and neonatal mortality in South Africa were included for synthesis. Literature search for eligible studies was conducted in five electronic databases: Medline, Africa-Wide Information, Scopus, Web of Science and CINAHL. Searches were restricted to articles written in English and presenting data covering the period between 1990 and 2015. Reference lists of retrieved articles were screened for additional publications, and grey literature was searched for relevant documents for the review. Three independent reviewers were involved in study selection, data extractions and achieving consensus. RESULTS In total, 969 studies were retrieved and 670 screened for eligibility yielding 25 studies reporting data on maternal mortality and 14 studies on neonatal mortality. Most of the studies had a low risk of bias. Estimates from the institutional reporting differed from the international metrics with wide uncertainty/confidence intervals. Moreover, modelled estimates were widely divergent from estimates obtained through empirical methods. In the last two decades, both maternal and neonatal mortality appear to have increased up to 2009, followed by a decrease, more pronounced in the care of maternal mortality. CONCLUSION Estimates from both global metrics and institutional reporting, although widely divergent, indicate South Africa has not achieved MDG 4a and 5a goals but made a significant progress in reducing maternal and neonatal mortality.

However, the factors and mechanisms that control neural APA isoforms are not well understood. Here, we show that three ELAV/Hu RNA binding proteins (Elav, Rbp9, and Fne) have similar capacities to induce a lengthened 3' UTR landscape in an ectopic setting. These factors promote accumulation of chromatin-associated, 3' UTR-extended, nascent transcripts, through inhibition of proximal polyadenylation site (PAS) usage. Notably, Elav represses an unannotated splice isoform of fne, switching the normally cytoplasmic Fne toward the nucleus in elav mutants. We use genomic profiling to reveal strong and broad loss of neural APA in elav/fne double mutant CNS, the first genetic background to largely abrogate this distinct APA signature. Overall, we demonstrate how regulatory interplay and functionally overlapping activities of neural ELAV/Hu RBPs drives the neural APA landscape.","Wei, Lu; Lee, Seungjae; Majumdar, Sonali; Zhang, Binglong; Sanfilippo, Piero; Joseph, Brian; Miura, Pedro; Soller, Matthias; Lai, Eric C",Molecular cell,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2020.09.007; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33007254/,424

We aimed to perform a comparative analysis of psychological symptoms in community-dwelling older adults with and without a history of a Covid-19 infection.Methods: In this study, we utilized a geriatric care unit's outpatient registry to prospectively enroll older adults with and without a history of Covid-19. An interviewer administered generalized anxiety disorder-2 (GAD-2), patient health questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), six-item cognitive impairment (6-CIT), and post-traumatic stress disorder-5 (PTSD-5) tests over the phone. Correlation and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to examine associations.Results: The study included 120 older subjects, 46 (38.3%) reported past Covid-19 infection. Anxiety and depression were both significantly more prevalent among subjects without a history of Covid-19. Having no history of Covid-19, female gender, and psychoactive medication use showed independent associations with the risk of depression symptoms among all subjects, and female gender was additionally associated with anxiety symptoms.Conclusion: This study showed that the risk of depression symptoms was higher in a sample of older adults who were not infected with Covid-19 compared to those recovering from the disease.Clinical implications: The impact of ""fear of transmission"" on the mental health of the elderly may be a significant issue to deal with.

OBJECTIVE This study aimed to evaluate the impact of provider- and patient-targeted educational interventions on postoperative opioid prescription and use following anorectal procedures. DESIGN Patients were enrolled on July 2019 through March 2020 after implementing educational interventions (study) and were compared with the pilot study group (control) enrolled on August 2018 through May 2019. A telephone survey was conducted 1 week postoperatively. SETTINGS This study was conducted at a 600-bed, safety-net hospital in southern California. PATIENTS Adult patients undergoing ambulatory anorectal procedures were included. Patients who had undergone an examination under anesthesia, had been incarcerated, and had used opioids preoperatively were excluded. INTERVENTIONS Educational interventions were developed based on the pilot study results. Providers received education on recommended opioid prescription quantities and a multimodal pain regimen. Standardized patient education infographics were distributed to patients pre- and postoperatively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcomes measured were total opioid prescribed, total opioid consumed, pain control satisfaction levels, and the need for additional opioid prescription. RESULTS A total of 104 of 122 (85%) patients enrolled responded to the survey and were compared with the 112 patients included in the control group. Despite similar demographics, the study cohort was prescribed fewer milligram morphine equivalents (78.8 ± 11.3 vs 294.0 ± 33.1, p < 0.001), consumed fewer milligram morphine equivalents (23.0 ± 28.0 vs 57.1 ± 45.8, p < 0.001), and had a higher rate of nonopioid medication use (72% vs 10%, p < 0.001). The 2 groups had similar pain control satisfaction levels (4.1 ± 1.3 vs 3.9 ± 1.1 out of 5, p = 0.12) and an additional opioid prescription requirement (5% vs 4%, p = 1.0). LIMITATIONS This study was limited by its single-center experience with specific patient population characteristics. CONCLUSION Educational interventions emphasizing evidence-based recommended opioid prescription quantities and regimented multimodal pain regimens are effective in decreasing excessive opioid prescribing and use without compromising satisfactory pain control in patients undergoing ambulatory anorectal procedures.

Se realizó una encuesta telefónica una semana después de la cirugía.ENTORNO CLÍNICO:Hospital de 600 camas en el sur de California.PACIENTES:Pacientes adultos sometidos a procedimientos anorrectales ambulatorios. Los criterios de exclusión fueron pacientes que recibieron un examen bajo anestesia, pacientes encarcelados y uso preoperatorio de opioides.INTERVENCIONES:Se desarrollaron intervenciones educativas basadas en los resultados del estudio piloto. Los proveedores recibieron educación sobre las cantidades recomendadas de opioides recetados y un régimen multimodal para el dolor. Se distribuyeron infografías estandarizadas de educación para el paciente antes y después de la operación.PRINCIPALES MEDIDAS DE RESULTADO:Opioide total prescrito, opioide total consumido, niveles de satisfacción del control del dolor y necesidad de prescripción adicional de opioides.RESULTADOS:Un total de 104 de 122 (85%) pacientes inscritos respondieron a la encuesta y se compararon con los 112 pacientes incluidos en el grupo de control. A pesar de una demografía similar, a la cohorte del estudio se le prescribió menos miligramos de equivalente de morfina (MME) (78,8 ± 11,3 frente a 294,0 ± 33,1, p <0,001), consumió menos MME (23,0 ± 28,0 frente a 57,1 ± 45,8, p <0,001) y presentaron una mayor tasa de uso de medicamentos no opioides (72% vs 10%, p <0,001). Los dos grupos tenían niveles similares de satisfacción del control del dolor (4,1 ± 1,3 frente a 3,9 ± 1,1 de 5, p = 0,12) y la necesidad de prescripción de opioides adicionales (5% frente a 4%, p = 1,0).LIMITACIONES:Experiencia en un solo centro con características específicas de la población de pacientes.CONCLUSIÓN:Las intervenciones educativas que enfatizan las cantidades recomendadas de prescripción de opioides basadas en la evidencia y los regímenes de dolor multimodales reglamentados son efectivas para disminuir la prescripción y el uso excesivos de opioides sin comprometer el control satisfactorio del dolor en pacientes sometidos a procedimientos anorrectales ambulatorios.

Treatment options are limited, particularly for anxiety. The aim of this study was to update our previous systematic review (2014) and evaluate via meta-analysis the efficacy of mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) for improving mental well-being in PwMS. METHODS Systematic searches for eligible randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were carried out in seven major databases (November 2017, July 2018), using medical subject headings and key words. Studies were screened, data extracted, quality appraised and analysed by two independent reviewers, using predefined criteria. Study quality was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. Mental well-being was the primary outcome. Random effects model meta-analysis was performed, with effect size reported as standardised mean difference (SMD). RESULTS Twelve RCTs including 744 PwMS were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review, eight had data extractable for meta-analysis; n=635. Ethnicity, socioeconomic status, comorbidity and disability were inconsistently reported. MBIs varied from manualised to tailored versions, lasting 6-9 weeks, delivered individually and via groups, both in person and online. Overall SMD for mental well-being (eight studies) was 0.40 (0.28-0.53), p<0.01, I2=28%; against active comparators only (three studies) SMD was 0.17 (0.01-0.32), p<0.05, I2 =0%. Only three adverse events were reported. CONCLUSIONS MBIs are effective at improving mental well-being in PwMS. More research is needed regarding optimal delivery method, cost-effectiveness and comparative-effectiveness.

The current COVID-19 pandemic, resulting from SARS-CoV-2, induces acute pneumonia, a phenotype that is alarmingly increased with aging. In this article, we review findings of how aging alters immunity to respiratory viral infections to identify age-impacted pathways common to several viral pathogens, permitting us to speculate about potential mechanisms of age-enhanced mortality to COVID-19. Aging generally leads to exaggerated innate immunity, particularly in the form of elevated neutrophil accumulation across murine and large animal studies of influenza infection. COVID-19 patients who succumb exhibit a 2-fold increase in neutrophilia, suggesting that exaggerated innate immunity contributes to age-enhanced mortality to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Further investigation in relevant experimental models will elucidate the mechanisms by which aging impacts respiratory viral infections, including SARS-CoV-2. Such investigation could identify therapies to reduce the suffering of the population at large, but especially among older people, infected with respiratory viruses.","Chen, Judy; Kelley, William J; Goldstein, Daniel R",Journal of immunology,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.2000380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32493812/,424

""Line"" was an extension line made along the starting point of the supraclavicular vessel for anterograde anatomy of 1-2 cm and the direction of the blood vessel. The extension line was used as the central axis of the designed island flap. Characteristics of flap blood supply, the time of flap preparation, flap survival, donor area recovery and clinical follow-up were recorded. Results: The arterial blood supply of the flap was constant, and the venous reflux was variable. The area of the prepared flap was (4-8) cm×(10-18) cm, and the preparation time was 30-60 min, with a median of 42 min. Skin flap survival rate was 100%. Partial necrosis of skin flap occurred in 1 patient and postoperative pharyngeal fistula occurred in 5 patients, all of whom were cured by dressing change. The donor site defects were closed and sutured directly. 3 patients had partial incision dehiscence and healed after dressing change.

METHODS A retrospective multi-institutional review was conducted by the Central Japan Lung Cancer Surgery Study Group. We analyzed both Echelon™ (EC) and EndoGIA™ (EGIA) staplers in this study. The stapling cartridges were classified into 3 colors according to the height of the ß loops: green (2.0 mm), gold (1.8 mm), and blue (1.5 mm). RESULTS Stapling of the pulmonary parenchyma was performed 9016 times. The total number of complications related to stapling was 61 (0.68 %). These complications were mainly caused by stapler-tissue thickness mismatch (n = 30, 49.2 %) and tissue fragility (n = 27, 44.3 %). The number and rate of complications of the different cartridges were 19 and 0.63 % for EGIA blue, 25 and 0.94 % for EGIA green, 1 and 0.067 % for EC gold, 12 and 0.98 % for EC blue, and 4 and 0.64 % for EC green, respectively. Complications associated with stapling using EC gold cartridges occurred less frequently than with the other cartridges (p = 0.0022). CONCLUSION The gold cartridge appears to cause the least complications and may therefore be the most appropriate cartridge for stapling the pulmonary parenchyma among the tested staplers.","Yano, Motoki; Yamada, Takeshi; Uchida, Tatsuo; Moriyama, Satoru; Haneda, Hiroshi; Okuda, Katsuhiro; Nakanishi, Ryoichi",Surgery today,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00595-015-1291-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26679710/,424
97877,Journal Club Using Virtual Breakout Rooms: Interactive Continuing Education with No Learner Preparation During COVID-19.,2020,"Trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansion and deletion are responsible for over 40 neurodegenerative diseases and associated with cancer. TNR can undergo somatic instability that is mediated by DNA damage and repair, and gene transcription. Recent studies have pointed towards a role for R-loops in causing TNR expansion and deletion, and it's been shown that base excision repair (BER) can result in CAG repeat deletions from R-loops in yeast. However, it remains unknown how BER in R-loops can mediate TNR instability. In this study, using biochemical approaches, we examined BER enzymatic activities and their influence on TNR-R-loops. We found that AP endonuclease 1 incised an abasic site on the non-template strand of a TNR R-loop, creating a double-flap intermediate containing an RNA-DNA hybrid that subsequently inhibited pol β DNA synthesis of TNRs. This stimulated flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) cleavage of TNRs engaged in an R-loop. Moreover, we showed that FEN1 also efficiently cleaved the RNA strand, facilitating pol β loop/hairpin bypass synthesis and the resolution of TNR R-loops through BER. Consequently, this resulted in fewer TNRs synthesized by pol β than those removed by FEN1, thereby leading to repeat deletion. Our results indicate that TNR R-loops preferentially lead to repeat deletion during BER by disrupting the balance between the addition and removal of TNRs. Our discoveries open a new avenue for the treatments and prevention of repeat expansion diseases and cancer.","Laverde, Eduardo E; Lai, Yanhao; Leng, Fenfei; Balakrishnan, Lata; Freudenreich, Catherine H; Liu, Yuan",The Journal of biological chemistry,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.ra120.014161; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32763971/,424

A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was performed on matched recipients of HD vs SD, based on vaccination time, location, age, sex, ethnicity and VHA priority level. ResultsAmong 569,552 person-seasons of observation, 207,574 (36%) were HD recipients and 361,978 (64%) were SD recipients, predominantly male (99%) and white (82%). Pooling findings from all three seasons, the adjusted rVE estimate of HD vs SD during the high influenza periods was 42% (95% confidence interval (CI): 24-59) against influenza/pneumonia-associated mortality and 27% (95% CI: 23-32) against cardiorespiratory mortality. Residual confounding was evident in both early and late influenza periods despite matching and multivariable adjustment. Excluding individuals with high 1-year predicted mortality at baseline reduced the residual confounding and yielded rVE of 36% (95% CI: 10-62) and 25% (95% CI: 12-38) against influenza/pneumonia-associated and cardiorespiratory mortality, respectively.

We aim to describe a series of patients that experienced immediate reperfusion injury with active intraprocedural extravasation within the territory of the deep penetrating arteries and provide real-time correlation with CT ""spot sign."" Methods This was a retrospective analysis of patients that suffered reperfusion injury with active arterial extravasation during endovascular stroke treatment in two tertiary care centers. Results Five patients were identified. Median age was 63 (58-71) years, 66% were male. Median NIHSS was 13.5 (9.5-23.0), platelet level 212,000 (142,000-235,000), baseline systolic blood pressure 152 (133-201) mm Hg, and non-contrast CT ASPECTS 7.0 (6.5-9.0). Two patients were taking aspirin and one had received intravenous thrombolysis. There were three middle cerebral artery M1, one internal carotid artery terminus, and one vertebrobasilar junction occlusion. Three patients had anterior circulation tandem occlusions. Stroke etiology was extracranial atherosclerosis (n = 2), intracranial atherosclerosis (n = 2), and cervical dissection (n = 1). The median time from onset to puncture was 5.5 (3.9-8.6) h. Intravenous heparin was administered in all patients (median dose of 4,750 [3,250-6,000] units) and intravenous abciximab in four. All tandem cases had the cervical lesion addressed first. Four lenticulostriates and one paramedian pontine artery were involved. Intraprocedural flat-panel CT was performed in four (80%) cases and provided real-time correlation between the active contrast extravasation and the ""spot sign."" The bailout included use of protamine, blood pressure control, and balloon guide catheter or intracranial compliant balloon inflation plus coiling of targeted vessel. All patients had angiographic cessation of bleeding at the end of the procedure with parenchymal hemorrhage type 1 in one case and type 2 in four. Three patients had modified Rankin score of 4 and two were dead at 90 days. Conclusions Active reperfusion hemorrhage involving perforator arteries was observed to correlate with the CT ""spot sign"" and to be associated with poor outcomes.","Haussen, Diogo C; Ferreira, Ivan M; Barreira, Clara; Grossberg, Jonathan A; Diana, Francesco; Peschillo, Simone; Nogueira, Raul G",Interventional neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000488084; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30410514/,424

METHODS A retrospective analysis of 150 consecutive patients from November 1991 to June 2011 was conducted. Symptomatic pseudomeningocele was defined clinically; to meet definition it must have required operative intervention. Variables evaluated included sex, age, use of graft, and use of operative sealant. The Chi-square, Fisher test, and the two-sample t-test were used as appropriate to determine significance. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine independent risk factors for complication. RESULTS A total of 67.3% of patients were female, with average age being 39.7 years. A total of 67.3% of patients had a graft placed with the most common being fascia lata. Only nine patients (6%) presented with pseudomeningocele. Factors observed to be significantly associated with pseudomeningocele development were age and use of sealant. Age and sealant use were also independent risk factors for complication. Adjusted for the significant effect of age, odds for complication among patients with sealant usage were 6.67 times those for patients without sealant. Adjusted for the significance of sealant usage, there is a 6% increase in odds for complication for every year increase in patient's age. CONCLUSIONS A statistically significant relationship exists between age and sealant use and the risk of developing a postoperative pseudomeningocele. Emphasis and attention must be placed on meticulous closure technique. This information can aide in preoperative planning and patient selection.","Menger, R; Connor, D E; Hefner, M; Caldito, G; Nanda, A",Surgical neurology international,https://doi.org/10.4103/2152-7806.156632; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25984384/,424

RECENT FINDINGS Healthcare standards are an essential component of data exchange and critical for clinical practice, research, and public health surveillance activities. Standards enable interoperability between clinical information systems, healthcare information exchange between institutions, and clinical decision support in a complex health information technology ecosystem. There are several gaps in standards in ophthalmology, including relatively low adoption of imaging standards, lack of use cases for integrating apps providing artificial intelligence -based decision support, lack of common data models to harmonize big data repositories, and no standards regarding interfaces and algorithmic outputs. SUMMARY These gaps in standards represent opportunities for future work to develop improved data flow between various elements of the digital health ecosystem. This will enable more widespread adoption and integration of artificial intelligence-based tools into clinical practice. Engagement and support from the ophthalmology community for standards development will be important for advancing this work.","Baxter, Sally L; Lee, Aaron Y",Current opinion in ophthalmology,https://doi.org/10.1097/icu.0000000000000781; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34231531/,424

To limit exposure and maintain a reserve of caregivers, residency education ceased most clinical activities and shifted to remote lecture consortiums hosted online across the country in lieu of ambulatory and operative experiences. Many practicing university otolaryngologists have transitioned their clinics to telehealth medicine to maintain access to clinical care during the pandemic. The participation of residents in telemedicine visits has not been described. Here we present guidelines and experience-based suggestions for successful resident involvement in telemedicine. While it is unclear what role telehealth medicine may play within the field of otolaryngology beyond the pandemic, our experiences suggest better patient outreach and access.

109136,New South Wales.,2017,"Hyperuricemia is a known cardiovascular risk factor. The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) losartan is known to decrease serum uric acid (UA) level. A recent in vitro study demonstrated a strong interaction between irbesartan and UA transporters that exceeded that of losartan. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the hypouricemic effect of irbesartan in a clinical setting. A total of 40 high-risk hypertensive outpatients with coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease and/or diabetes complications who were taking ARBs other than irbesartan and losartan were enrolled in this study. After a 4-week control period, the patients' prescribed ARBs were exchanged for an equivalent dose of irbesartan. We assessed blood pressure, heart rate, serum UA level, parameters of lipid and glucose metabolism, cardiac and renal function and inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in blood samples taken immediately before the initiation of irbesartan treatment and again after 12 weeks of treatment. All 40 recruited patients were followed (31 men and 9 women, mean age: 68 years) without any dropouts. During the 12 weeks of irbesartan treatment, no significant changes in blood pressure, heart rate, parameters of lipid or glucose metabolism or other biomarkers of cardiac function, renal function, or inflammation were observed. However, UA level (5.9±1.6 to 5.5±1.6 mg ml(-1), P=0.028) and the oxidative stress marker derivative reactive oxygen metabolites (dROMs) (354±83 to 310±65 U.CARR, P<0.001) were significantly lower at 12 weeks of treatment compared with before treatment. These results suggest that irbesartan has beneficial effects on hyperuricemia and oxidative stress.","Chida, Ryuji; Hisauchi, Itaru; Toyoda, Shigeru; Kikuchi, Migaku; Komatsu, Takaaki; Hori, Yuichi; Nakahara, Shiro; Sakai, Yoshihiko; Inoue, Teruo; Taguchi, Isao",Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1038/hr.2015.82; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26178150/,424

The objective was to examine type III, IV, and VI collagens turnovers in SSc and investigate longitudinal alterations in relation to modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS). We included patients fulfilling the 2013 ACR/EULAR criteria for SSc (limited cutaneous [lcSSc, n = 20], diffuse cutaneous SSc [dcSSc, n = 23]) and healthy controls (HC, n = 10). Biomarkers of type III, IV, and VI collagens formation (PRO-C3, PRO-C4, PRO-C6) and degradation (C3M, C4M, C6M) were measured in serum. The fibrotic index of the individual collagens (FICol) were calculated. The fibrotic index of type III and VI collagens (FICol3 and FICol6) were increased in dcSSc compared to lcSSc (FICol3: 1.4 vs. 0.8, P = 0.0001; FICol6: 1.2 vs. 0.9, P = 0.03). The fibrotic index of type IV collagen (FICol4) was not different between the groups but was 1.5 times higher than HC (HC: 6.9, lcSSc 10.4, dcSSc: 10.5). Both FICol3 and FICol6 correlated with mRSS with rho's of 0.59 (P < 0.0001) and 0.35 (P = 0.04). Furthermore, FICol3 steadily decrease over the disease course.

We investigated the performance characteristics of a high-throughput RT-PCR-coupled ESI-MS assay for distinguishing biothreat (BT) agents from common bacterial, fungal, and viral respiratory pathogens in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid specimens from subjects with suspected respiratory infections. In a retrospective case series, 202 BAL fluid specimens were collected at the Johns Hopkins Hospital between August 2010 and February 2011 from patients with suspected acute respiratory infections. Samples were processed using standard bacterial, viral, and fungal testing in the clinical microbiology laboratory as part of routine care and then were blindly spiked with either water or nucleic acids from BT organisms (Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, Brucella spp., Burkholderia spp., and Rickettsia prowazekii) and tested by RT-PCR-ESI-MS. The sensitivities and specificities of RT-PCR-ESI-MS versus standard clinical methods were as follows: for mock BT DNA, 98.5% sensitivity (95% confidence interval [CI], 94.2 to 99.7%) and 100% specificity (95% CI, 93.1 to 100.0%); for bacterial pathogens, 81.8% sensitivity (95% CI, 74.3 to 87.6%) and 73.6% specificity (95% CI, 64.2 to 81.4%); for viral pathogens, 93.3% sensitivity (95% CI, 66.0 to 99.7%) and 97.3% specificity (95% CI, 89.7 to 99.5%); for fungal pathogens, 42.6% sensitivity (95% CI, 29.5 to 56.7%) and 97.8% specificity (95% CI, 91.8 to 99.6%).

Since activity limitations and impaired health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in ILD are similar to those in other chronic respiratory diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary rehabilitation is also indicated for patients with ILD. This rehabilitation program mainly comprises exercise training and self-management education. Exercise training is the most important component of pulmonary rehabilitation. It significantly improves dyspnea and enhances exercise capacity and HRQoL in patients with ILD. The standard exercise prescription used for COPD is also effective for ILD. However, considering that disease progression and exercise-limiting factors are different in patients with COPD is necessary. Severe EIH, the adverse effects of corticosteroid administration, and comorbidities often lead to difficulty in employing a sufficient exercise intensity. Some modifications in the exercise prescription for individual patients or strategies to minimize EIH and dyspnea are required to optimize training intensity. Since EIH is common and severe in patients with ILD, supplemental oxygen should be provided. In advanced and more severe patients, who have difficulty in performing exercises, energy conservation techniques and the use of energy-saving devices to improve and maintain the patients' activities of daily living may be effective．.","Kozu, Ryo; Shingai, Kazuya; Hanada, Masatoshi; Oikawa, Masato; Nagura, Hiroki; Ito, Hiroshi; Kitagawa, Chika; Tanaka, Takako",Physical therapy research,https://doi.org/10.1298/ptr.r0012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33981523/,424

In this study we derived a PK-PD model for propofol in adolescents undergoing idiopathic scoliosis surgery with an intraoperative wake-up test with reinduction of anesthesia using both Bispectral Index (BIS) and composite A-line ARX index (cAAI) as endpoints. METHODS Fourteen adolescents (9.8-20.1 years) were evaluated during standardized propofol-remifentanil anesthesia for idiopathic scoliosis surgery with an intraoperative wake-up test with reinduction of anesthesia. BIS and cAAI were continuously measured and blood samples collected. A propofol PKPD model was developed using NONMEM. RESULTS The time courses of propofol concentrations, BIS and cAAI values during anesthesia, intra-operative wakeup and reduction of anesthesia were best described by a two-compartment PK model linked to an inhibitory sigmoidal Emax PD model. For the sigmoidal Emax model, the propofol concentration at half maximum effect (EC50) was 3.51 and 2.14 mg/L and Hill coefficient 1.43 and 6.85 for BIS and cAAI, respectively. The delay in PD effect in relation to plasma concentration was best described by a two compartment effect-site model with a keo of 0.102 min- 1, ke12 of 0.121 min- 1 and ke21 of 0.172 min- 1. CONCLUSIONS A population PKPD model for propofol in adolescents was developed that successfully described the time course of propofol concentration, BIS and cAAI in individuals upon undergoing scoliosis surgery with intraoperative wake-up test and reinduction of anesthesia. Large differences were demonstrated between both monitors. This may imply that BIS and cAAI measure fundamentally different endpoints in the brain.","Blussé van Oud-Alblas, Heleen J; Brill, Margreke J E; Peeters, Mariska Y M; Tibboel, Dick; Danhof, Meindert; Knibbe, Catherijne A J",BMC anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12871-019-0684-z; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30669968/,424

In addition, identifying correlates of protection is of utmost importance, and comparisons of available testing systems with functional assays, such as direct viral neutralisation, are needed.We analysed 6658 samples consisting of true-positives (n=193), true-negatives (n=1091), and specimens of unknown status (n=5374). For primary testing, we used Euroimmun-Anti-SARS-CoV-2-ELISA-IgA/IgG and Roche-Elecsys-Anti-SARS-CoV-2. Subsequently virus-neutralisation, GeneScriptcPass, VIRAMED-SARS-CoV-2-ViraChip, and Mikrogen-recomLine-SARS-CoV-2-IgG were applied for confirmatory testing. Statistical modelling generated optimised assay cut-off thresholds. Sensitivity of Euroimmun-anti-S1-IgA was 64.8%, specificity 93.3% (manufacturer's cut-off); for Euroimmun-anti-S1-IgG, sensitivity was 77.2/79.8% (manufacturer's/optimised cut-offs), specificity 98.0/97.8%; Roche-anti-N sensitivity was 85.5/88.6%, specificity 99.8/99.7%. In true-positives, mean and median Euroimmun-anti-S1-IgA and -IgG titres decreased 30/90 days after RT-PCR-positivity, Roche-anti-N titres decreased significantly later. Virus-neutralisation was 80.6% sensitive, 100.0% specific (≥1:5 dilution). Neutralisation surrogate tests (GeneScriptcPass, Mikrogen-recomLine-RBD) were >94.9% sensitive and >98.1% specific. Optimised cut-offs improved test performances of several tests. Confirmatory testing with virus-neutralisation might be complemented with GeneScriptcPassTM or recomLine-RBD for certain applications.

Methods A total of 31 patients (18 males, 13 females; mean age 51.5 years; range, 39 to 61 years) who were treated with long-term mechanical ventilation due to low cardiac output syndrome after cardiopulmonary bypass and cardiac surgery were retrospectively analyzed between December 2014 and December 2018. In addition, an in vitro lung model and different doses of hydroxyethyl starch in the heat and moisture exchangers to mimic the airway secretions were used and the proper interval to change heat and moisture exchangers was evaluated. Results In the in vitro l ung m odel, t he m ean a irway r esistance was 19.4±0.2 cmH2O/L/sec in the 5 mL group (p=0.060), 20.3±1.0 cmH2O/L/sec in the 10 mL group (p=0.065), and 30.2±1.7 cmH2O/L/sec in the 15 mL group (p<0.001). The airway resistance of heat and moisture exchangers, and total hospital stay and ventilation duration significantly increased in the seven-day group compared to the one-day and three-day groups. The positive culture of bacteria was also significantly higher in the seven-day group. Conclusion Our study results suggest that heat and moisture exchangers can be safely used for an efficient and timely removal of airway secretions. Volume of approximately 15 mL of liquid in the airflow can dramatically increase the airway resistance. The three-day interval of changing heat and moisture exchangers is ideal in a cardiothoracic surgery intensive care unit where patients have more airway secretions than patients in the general intensive care unit.","Liu, Huan; Wang, Hongpeng; Mu, Zeshu; Ye, Lin; Jiang, Yingjiu",Turk gogus kalp damar cerrahisi dergisi,https://doi.org/10.5606/tgkdc.dergisi.2020.20088; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33403131/,424

The aim of this study was to describe the clinical, pathological, and laboratory findings of a series of patients who developed chilblains during the COVID-19 outbreak and to investigate the possible factors that could be involved in the pathogenesis of these lesions. METHODS We conducted a prospective cohort study that included 54 patients who presented with chilblains during the highest peak in the incidence of COVID-19 in Cantabria (northern Spain). Skin biopsies were performed on 10 of these patients who presented with recent lesions. Laboratory investigations, including immunological analysis, serological studies, and the assessment of cryoproteins, were also performed. RESULTS Most patients presented erythematous plaques located on the toes and/or purpuric macules located on the feet. Histopathological findings were compatible with those of idiopathic chilblains. Immunohistochemical evaluation showed C3d and C4d deposits in the vessel walls in seven cases. The autoimmunity panel was negative in most of our series. Cryoprotein testing showed positive cryofibrinogen in two-thirds (66.7%) of the patients assessed. On follow-up, most patients presented almost complete resolution, although six patients required prednisone and antiaggregant drug treatment.

This pandemic caused a widening economic crisis, growing financial loss, and numerous uncertainties. This pandemic brought alarming implications and overall increased risk for psychiatric illness. This study explores the psychological impact experienced by patients who tested positive from coronavirus disease in the Najran region, Saudi Arabia. DESIGN AND METHODS This exploratory analysis included 210 COVID-19 positive patients. The study was conducted during a six month period starting from March to September 2020, in two tertiary government hospitals in Najran, Saudi Arabia. Samples were selected using purposive sampling. The researches utilized survey questionnaire and face-to-face interview to collect the data. The statistical data were calculated using IBM Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 2.0 to compute the following statistical formulas: percentage distribution, mean, standard deviation, and Chi-square test of independence. RESULTS The findings of this study revealed that the majority of COVID-19 positive patients were middle-aged adults (n=98 or 46.7%), male (n=178 or 84.8%), and were non-Saudi nationals (n=132 or 62.9%). It was found out that COVID-19 patients experienced bothersome behaviour at a very high level (x̅=2.63 ± 0.6734). Meanwhile, depression (x̅=2.51 ± 0.7070), worry (x̅=2.23 ± 0.8811), and anxiety (x̅=2.21 ± 0.8719) was only at a high level. CONCLUSIONS The study findings revealed that the majority of participants had high levels of depression, anxiety and bothersome behaviours. However, demographic characteristics like age, sex, and nationality were not significantly related to coronavirus patients' psychological health problems during the pandemic.

125809,Experiences of nursing students under the unprecedented abrupt online learning format forced by the national curfew due to COVID-19: A qualitative research study.,2021-02-27,"Food waste (FW) is a worldwide environmental issue due to its huge production amount. FW separation from municipal solid waste followed by different treatment strategies has been widely accepted. Food waste disposer (FWD) is a promising approach to separate and collect household food waste (HFW), which has been widely applied in many countries. However, the feasibility of FWD application in many countries is still being debated due to the major concerns over the impact of FWD on the wastewater treatment plants. In order to investigate the feasibility of FWD application, FW characterization is a key work to be conducted in advance. Since the FW characteristics largely vary by region, reliable and representative FW characteristics in different countries should be investigated. To provide such information for further studies on FW management for Hong Kong, HFW was collected from Hong Kong typical households over one year and analyzed systemically in this study. The FW composition varied little from place to place or season to season, and the values observed were comparable with results reported from other countries and regions. Based on the reliable HFW characteristics obtained from one-year survey coupled with statistical analysis, simulated HFW for Hong Kong consisting of 50% fruits, 20% vegetables, 20% starchy food and 10% meat was proposed for future studies. On the other hand, the FWD treatment caused more than 50% of the biodegradable organic content in HFW to dissolve. With a ratio of 1 g food waste to 1 L sewage, total solids in the wastewater stream were predicted to increase by 73%, total chemical oxygen demand by 61%, soluble chemical oxygen demand by 110%, nitrogen by 6% and phosphorus by 16%. Theoretically, 22 million m3/year of additional methane could be generated if 50% of Hong Kong residential buildings equipped with FWD. That would certainly increase pollutant loading on the wastewater treatment plants, but also energy recovery potential.","Zan, Feixiang; Dai, Ji; Hong, Yuze; Wong, Meiyin; Jiang, Feng; Chen, Guanghao",Waste management,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2017.11.051; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29208531/,424
125863,State report SA.,2020-08-01,"BACKGROUND Recently, severe manifestations associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) have been recognized. Analysis of studies for this novel syndrome is needed for a better understanding of effective management among affected children. METHODS An extensive search strategy was conducted by combining the terms multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children and coronavirus infection or using the term multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children in bibliographic electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL) and in preprint servers (BioRxiv.org and MedRxiv.org) following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Metaanalyses guidelines to retrieve all articles published from January 1, 2020, to July 31, 2020. Observational cross-sectional, cohort, case series, and case reports were included. RESULTS A total of 328 articles were identified. Sixteen studies with 655 participants (aged 3 months-20 years) were included in the final analysis. Most of the children in reported studies presented with fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, and Kawasaki Disease-like symptoms. Sixty-eight percent of the patients required critical care; 40% needed inotropes; 34% received anticoagulation; and 15% required mechanical ventilation. More than two-thirds of the patients received intravenous immunoglobulin and 49% received corticosteroids. Remdesivir and convalescent plasma were the least commonly utilized therapies. Left ventricular dysfunction was reported in 32% of patients. Among patients presenting with KD-like symptoms, 23% developed coronary abnormalities and 26% had circulatory shock. The majority recovered; 11 (1.7%) children died. CONCLUSIONS This systematic review delineates and summarizes clinical features, management, and outcomes of MIS-C associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Although most children required intensive care and immunomodulatory therapies, favorable outcomes were reported in the majority with low-mortality rates.","Kaushik, Ashlesha; Gupta, Sandeep; Sood, Mangla; Sharma, Seema; Verma, Shikha",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,https://doi.org/10.1097/inf.0000000000002888; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32925547/,424

We compared the measurements with the air quality standards and guidelines for aircraft cabins and in some cases buildings. Average levels of VOCs for which limits exist were lower than the permissible levels except for benzene with average concentration at 5.9 ± 5.5 μg/m3 . Toluene, benzene, ethylbenzene, formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, limonene, nonanal, hexanal, decanal, octanal, acetic acid, acetone, ethanol, butanal, acrolein, isoprene and menthol were the most frequently measured compounds. The concentrations of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) and other contaminants did not exceed standards and guidelines in buildings except for the average NO2 concentration at 12 ppb. Although the focus was on VOCs, we also retrieved the data on other parameters characterizing cabin environment. Ozone concentration averaged 38 ppb below the upper limit recommended for aircraft. The outdoor air supply rate ranged from 1.7 to 39.5 L/s per person and averaged 6.0 ± 0.8 L/s/p (median 5.8 L/s/p), higher than the minimum level recommended for commercial aircraft. Carbon dioxide concentration averaged 1315 ± 232 ppm, lower than what is permitted in aircraft and close to what is permitted in buildings. Measured temperatures averaged 23.5 ± 0.8°C and were generally within the ranges recommended for avoiding thermal discomfort.

In addition, H5N1 avian influenza viruses represent a significant threat to public health. Therefore, the rapid detection of H5 viruses is very important in order to control the disease. In this study, a qualitative reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification (RT-RPA) assay for the detection of hemagglutinin gene of H5 subtype influenza viruses was developed. The results were compared to the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). An in vitro transcribed RNA standard of 970 nucleotides of the hemagglutinin gene was developed and used to determine the assay sensitivity. The developed H5 RT-RPA assay was able to detect one RNA molecule within 7 min, while in real-time RT-PCR, at least 90 min was required. H5 RT-RPA assay did not detect nucleic acid extracted from H5 negative samples or from other pathogens producing respiratory manifestation in poultry. The clinical performance of the H5 RT-RPA assay was tested in 30 samples collected between 2014 and 2015; the sensitivity of H5 RT-RPA and real-time RT-PCR was 100%. In conclusion, H5 RT-RPA was faster than real-time RT-PCR and easily operable in a portable device.

Coagulation dysfunction, hypotension, disturbed microcirculation and multiorgan failure occur frequently. These severe conditions result from an overwhelming inflammatory response, induced by pathogen and damage associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs) released into the bloodstream. In the present study, we demonstrated that the synthetic Lipopolysaccharid (LPS)-binding peptide 19-2.5 interferes with the activation of the coagulation and contact system. Moreover, binding of LPS to high molecular weight kininogen (HK), one of the major LPS carrier in blood, could be prevented by the peptide. Thus, peptide 19-2.5 might represent a promising target in the treatment of endotoxemia and sepsis, not only by its anti-inflammatory potential, but also by the anticoagulant effect, together with its ability to prevent degradation of HK.","Köhler, Juliane; Ehler, Johannes; Kreikemeyer, Bernd; Bajorath, Rika; Schürholz, Tobias; Oehmcke-Hecht, Sonja",Scientific reports,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-64155-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32346013/,424

Energy-based, electrosurgical, and ultrasonic devices have recently replaced the use of sutures and mechanical clips (which leave foreign objects in the body) for many surgical procedures, providing rapid hemostasis during surgery. However, these devices have the potential to create an undesirably large collateral zone of thermal damage and tissue necrosis. We explore an alternative energy-based technology, infrared lasers, for rapid and precise thermal coagulation and fusion of the blood vessel walls. Seven near-infrared lasers (808, 980, 1075, 1470, 1550, 1850 to 1880, and 1908 nm) were tested during preliminary tissue studies. Studies were performed using fresh porcine renal vessels, ex vivo, with native diameters of 1 to 6 mm, and vessel walls flattened to a total thickness of 0.4 mm. A linear beam profile was applied normal to the vessel for narrow, full-width thermal coagulation. The laser irradiation time was 5 s. Vessel burst pressure measurements were used to determine seal strength. The 1470 nm laser wavelength demonstrated the capability of sealing a wide range of blood vessels from 1 to 6 mm diameter with burst strengths of 578 ± 154, 530 ± 171, and 426 ± 174 mmHg for small, medium, and large vessel diameters, respectively. Lateral thermal coagulation zones (including the seal) measured 1.0 ± 0.4 mm on vessels sealed at this wavelength. Other laser wavelengths (1550, 1850 to 1880, and 1908 nm) were also capable of sealing vessels, but were limited by lower vessel seal pressures, excessive charring, and/or limited power output preventing treatment of large vessels (>4 mm outer diameter).","Cilip, Christopher M; Rosenbury, Sarah B; Giglio, Nicholas; Hutchens, Thomas C; Schweinsberger, Gino R; Kerr, Duane; Latimer, Cassandra; Nau, William H; Fried, Nathaniel M",Journal of biomedical optics,https://doi.org/10.1117/1.jbo.18.5.058001; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23640080/,424

It is a pandemic and public health challenge ravaging the world today. Unfortunately, with the daily increase of infected individuals, there is no known drug approved for the treatment of COVID-19. However, there are therapeutic drugs with the potentials to inhibit endocytic pathways, suppress ribonucleic acid (RNA) polymerase activities, and reduce the replication of SARS-CoV-2. These drugs modifications are aimed at reducing inflammation, time of recovery, and number of deaths. This review is aimed at providing updated information on the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, preventive measures and therapeutic drugs used against SARS-CoV-2. The finding of this review revealed that some of these drugs are transmembrane protease, serine 2, and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 inhibitors with the capacity to block the entrance/replication of SARS-CoV-2 in a host cell and therefore, may be promising in preventing the spread and mortality of SARS-CoV-2. However, these drugs may cause detrimental health effects such as toxic and non-efficacy issues.

Material and methods From 2015 to 2016 four patients (3 male, mean 43.9 years, range 33-52 years) with acute (3 cases) and acute-on-chronic (1 case) PVMVT underwent transvenous thrombolysis. All patients received initial AngioJet (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) thrombectomy followed by continuous catheter directed thrombolysis with Urokinase (Medac, Wedel, Germany) for 22-52 hours. Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts (TIPS), using Viatorr stent grafts (W.L. Gore and Associates, AZ, USA; mean diameter: 10 mm, length: 60-80 mm), were implanted in all patients. Patients were followed clinically and with imaging (mean 646 days, range 392 to 936 days). Results Technical success was 100%. Therapeutic success was achieved in 75% of cases. AngioJet-assisted thrombectomy substantially reduced thrombus load in the acute cases, while only slight improvement was achieved in the acute-on-chronic case. Continuous thrombolysis subtotally re-established PV flow in the acute cases, while only minimal improvement was seen in the acute-on-chronic case. Following TIPS implantation complete PV recanalisation could be achieved in all acute cases. In the acute-on-chronic case initial stagnant PV flow was seen; however, PV and TIPS re-occluded 10 days after implantation. During follow-up PV remained patent in acute cases. Conclusions AngioJet-assisted thrombectomy was technically feasible and uncomplicated in all of our patients. The initial results suggest that AngioJet-assisted thrombectomy facilitates recanalisation in acute and severe cases of PVMVT.","Kuetting, Daniel; Wolter, Karsten; Luetkens, Julian; Trebicka, Jonel; Praktiknjo, Michael; Thomas, Daniel; Meyer, Carsten",Polish journal of radiology,https://doi.org/10.5114/pjr.2018.81380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30805065/,424

Bioreduction of acetophenone, 4-fluoro acetophenone, 4-methyl acetophenone, and 3-hydroxy acetophenone was carried out using different fungal cultures isolated from soil. Among the fungal isolates, Penicillium sp. and Aspergillus sp. showed significant bioconversion with varying enantio-selectivity. However, the Penicillium sp. has shown the maximum ability of bioreduction. The potential isolate was characterized using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and found to be Penicillium rubens VIT SS1 (Genbank accession number: MK063869.1), which showed higher conversion and selectivity > 90%. The biocatalyst production and the reaction conditions were optimized using Taguchi analysis. The process conditions such as pH, temperature, media components, cosolvent, and substrate dosing were evaluated for the bioreduction of 3-hydroxy acetophenone, which is a key chiral intermediate of Phenylephrine and Rivastigmine using P. rubens VIT SS1.

143799,Ocular Pathology: Role of Emerging Viruses in the Asia-Pacific Region-A Review.,2014,"BACKGROUND The presence of leukocyte esterase in the synovial fluid has recently been proposed as a marker for periprosthetic joint infection. However, the sensitivity and specificity of leukocyte esterase has not been determined when matched for the current, most inclusive Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria for periprosthetic joint infection. METHODS The presence of leukocyte esterase was prospectively evaluated in synovial joint aspirates from hips and knees from May 2009 to May 2013. The cohort consisted of 189 hip and knee aspirations (fifty-two positive and 137 negative for infection). If the aspirate was bloody, a centrifuge was used to precipitate red blood cells and obtain clear synovial fluid. A standard chemical test strip (graded as negative, trace, +, or ++) was used to detect the presence of leukocyte esterase. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the leukocyte esterase strip test were calculated using ++ and ++/+ as two positive strip result scenarios. RESULTS Synovial fluid was obtained from 221 joints that underwent revision total hip or total knee arthroplasty for either mechanical failure or periprosthetic infection. Due to the lack of adequate criteria for MSIS criteria classification, thirty-two joints were excluded. The leukocyte esterase test with a threshold of +/++ had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 79.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65.9% to 89.2%), 80.8% (95% CI, 73.3% to 87.1%), 61.8% (95% CI, 49.2% to 73.3%), and 90.1% (95% CI, 84.3% to 95.4%), respectively. Using the ++ as a positive leukocyte esterase result, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 66.0% (95% CI, 51.7% to 78.5%), 97.1% (95% CI, 92.6% to 99.2%), 89.7% (95% CI, 75.8% to 97.1%), and 88.0% (95% CI, 81.7% to 92.7%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS When matched to the current MSIS criteria, the leukocyte esterase strip test yielded a high specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and moderate sensitivity. These results demonstrate that leukocyte esterase is an accurate, effective marker of periprosthetic joint infection as defined by the MSIS criteria. The leukocyte esterase strip test is a valuable tool that can be used in conjunction with the current battery of diagnostic tests available.","Tischler, Eric H; Cavanaugh, Priscilla K; Parvizi, Javad",The Journal of bone and joint surgery.

METHODS We reviewed our Institutional Review Board approved database from November 2001 to January 2011, containing 335 tumors treated with either laparoscopic (LRFA) or percutaneous RFA (CTRFA). Preoperative patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and intraoperative surgical data were collected along with biopsy results and clinicopathologic outcomes. RESULTS RFA was performed on 335 renal tumors (124 LRFA, 211 CTRFA). Non-diagnostic biopsy occurred in 18 (5.5%) tumors. Of the 317 procedures performed, 121 complications occurred in 103 (30.7%) procedures. Multivariate analysis only showed CTRFA (vs LRFA) to increase the likelihood of non-diagnostic biopsy (OR 5.1, 95% CI 1.2-22, p = 0.032). Increased tumor size (p = 0.007) and synchronous ablations (p = 0.019) increased the risk for major complications, while decreased surgeon experience (p = 0.003) and tumors close to the collecting system (p = 0.005) increased the risk of any complication. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative recommendations can be made to patients in the future. We suggest counseling patients that when undergoing RFA, percutaneous approach increases the risk of non-diagnostic biopsy, increased tumor size increases the risk of major complications, having more than 1 tumor ablated increases the risk of a major complication, and tumors close to the collecting system may increase the risk of complications.","Castle, Scott M; Gorin, Michael A; Gorbatiy, Vladislav; Leveillee, Raymond J",World journal of urology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00345-012-0823-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22249341/,424

The nature of OEM data, as acquired in clinical use, gives rise to the presence of uninformative frames (i.e., pure-noise and motion-artefacts). Uninformative frames can comprise a considerable proportion (up to > 25%) of a dataset, increasing the resources required for analyzing the data (both manually and automatically), as well as diluting the results of any automated quantification analysis. OBJECTIVE There is, therefore, a need to automatically detect and remove as many of these uninformative frames as possible while keeping frames with structural information intact. METHODS This paper employs Gray Level Cooccurrence Matrix texture measures and detection theory to identify and remove such frames. The detection of pure-noise and motion-artefacts frames is treated as two independent problems. RESULTS Pulmonary OEM frame sequences of the distal lung are employed for the development and assessment of the approach. The proposed approach identifies and removes uninformative frames with a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 92.6%. CONCLUSION The detection algorithm is accurate and robust in pulmonary OEM frame sequences.

The involvement of GAS5 in osteoporosis was investigated in this study. Methods Expression levels of GAS5 and miR-21 in plasma of both osteoporosis patients and healthy controls were determined by RT-qPCR. Diagnostic values of GAS5 and miR-21 for osteoporosis were analyzed by ROC curve analysis. Overexpression experiments were used to assess the interactions between GAS5 and miR-21. The roles of GAS5 and miR-21 in the apoptosis of osteoclasts were investigated by cell apoptosis assay. Results The present study aimed to investigate the roles of GAS5 in osteoporosis. The results showed that GAS5 was upregulated, while miR-21 was downregulated in plasma of osteoporosis patients. Expression levels of GAS5 and miR-21 were inversely correlated across plasma samples from osteoporosis patients but not the plasma samples from the controls. Altered expression of GAS5 and miR-21 distinguished osteoporosis patients from the controls. In osteoclasts, overexpression of GAS5 led to downregulation of miR-21, while overexpression of miR-21 did not affect the expression of GAS5. Overexpression of GAS5 led to promoted apoptosis of osteoclasts, while overexpression of miR-21 led to suppressed apoptosis of osteoclasts. In addition, overexpression of miR-21 attenuated the enhancing effects of overexpressing GAS5 on cell apoptosis. Conclusion GAS5 is upregulated in osteoporosis and may downregulate miR-21 to promote the apoptosis of osteoclasts.","Cong, Chunlei; Tian, Jun; Gao, Tianqi; Zhou, Changlin; Wang, Yuxiang; Cui, Xintao; Zhu, Liyu",Clinical interventions in aging,https://doi.org/10.2147/cia.s235197; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32764903/,424

148366,Neonatal antibodies to infectious agents and risk of bipolar disorder: a population-based case-control study.,2011,"SARS-CoV-2 virus is an infectious agent commonly found in certain mammalian animal species and today also in humans. SARS-CoV-2, can cause a pandemic infection with severe acute lung injury respiratory distress syndrome in patients with COVID-19, that can lead to patient death across all ages. The pathology associated with pandemic infection is linked to an over-response of immune cells, including virus-activated macrophages and mast cells (MCs). The local inflammatory response in the lung that occurs after exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is due to a complex network of activated inflammatory innate immune cells and structural lung cells such as bronchial epithelial cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts. Bronchial epithelial cells and fibroblasts activated by SARS-CoV-2 can result in the up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and induction of MC differentiation. In addition, endothelial cells which control leukocyte traffic through the expression of adhesion molecules are also able to amplify leukocyte activation by generating interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and CXC chemokines. In this pathologic environment, the activation of mast cells (MCs) causes the release of histamine, proteases, cytokines, chemokines and arachidonic acid compounds, such as prostaglandin D2 and leukotrienes, all of which are involved in the inflammatory network. Histamine is stored endogenously within the secretory granules of MCs and is released into the vessels after cell stimulation. Histamine is involved in the expression of chemokine IL-8 and cytokine IL-6, an effect that can be inhibited by histamine receptor antagonists. IL-1 is a pleiotropic cytokine that is mainly active in inflammation and immunity. Alveolar macrophages activated by SARS-CoV-2 through the TLR produce IL-1 which stimulates MCs to produce IL-6. IL-1 in combination with IL-6 leads to excessive inflammation which can be lethal. In an interesting study published several years ago (by E. Vannier et al., 1993), it was found that histamine as well as IL-1 are implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary inflammatory reaction, after micorganism immune cell activation. IL-1 in combination with histamine can cause a strong increase of IL-1 levels and, consequently, a higher degree of inflammation. However, it has been reported that histamine alone has no effect on IL-1 production. Furthermore, histamine enhances IL-1-induced IL-6 gene expression and protein synthesis via H2 receptors in peripheral monocytes. Therefore, since MCs are large producers of histamine in inflammatory reactions, this vasoactive amine, by increasing the production of IL-1, can amplify the inflammatory process in the lung infected with SARS-CoV-2. Here, we have proposed for the first time an emerging role for histamine released by MCs which in combination with IL-1 can cause an increase in lung inflammation induced by the viral infection SARS-CoV-2.","Conti, P; Caraffa, Al; Tetè, G; Gallenga, C E; Ross, R; Kritas, S K; Frydas, I; Younes, A; Di Emidio, P; Ronconi, G",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,https://doi.org/10.23812/20-2edit; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32945158/,424

While the right to express contrarian views feeds a robust marketplace of ideas that is essential for scientific progress, physicians advocating ineffective or dangerous cures, or actively opposing public health measures, pose a grave threat to societal welfare. Increasingly, a distinction has been made between professional speech that occurs during the physician-patient encounter and public speech that transpires beyond the clinical setting, with physicians being afforded wide latitude to voice empirically false claims outside the context of patient care. This paper argues that such a bifurcated model does not sufficiently address the challenges of an age when mass communications and social media allow dissenting physicians to offer misleading medical advice to the general public on a mass scale. Instead, a three-tiered model that distinguishes between citizen speech, physician speech and clinical speech would best serve authorities when regulating physician expression.","Appel, Jacob M",Journal of medical ethics,https://doi.org/10.1136/medethics-2021-107256; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33910972/,424
150747,A Little Hurts a Lot: Exploring the Impact of Microaggressions in Pediatric Medical Education.,2020-06-03,"BACKGROUND Laparoscopic Surgery has become a worldwide standard procedure for a variety of indications. This has been attributed to a milder postoperative inflammatory response by the innate immune system potentially mediated through immune mediators released by the visceral adipose tissue (VAT). However, an in vivo experimental evidence is lacking and is the issue of our present study. METHODS Male Wistar rats (N = 24) underwent standardized surgical procedures of conventional cecum resection (CCR), conventional sham operation, laparoscopic cecum resection (LCR), or laparoscopic sham operation. Cytokine expression of leptin, resistin, and IL-6 was analyzed in VAT before and after resection by quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS Postoperative leptin gene expression was reduced in the CCR and LCR groups, while expression was not significantly affected in both sham groups compared to the preoperative levels. In contrast, IL-6 expression was not affected in the LCR group, but was significantly elevated in the CCR cohort. The IL-6 expression was significantly higher in CCR compared to LCR. Resistin expression levels did not differ between all groups. CONCLUSIONS Our study underlines the role of immunological involvement of VAT in the postoperative phase. Low leptin levels seem to act as a stimulator for energy uptake in order to cope with postoperative stress. A lower IL-6 expression in the LCR compared to the CCR group may indicate a weaker inflammatory activity potentially adding to the clinical benefits observed in patients undergoing LS.","Lingohr, Philipp; Dohmen, Jonas; Matthaei, Hanno; Konieczny, Nils; Hoffmann, Juliane; Bölke, Edwin; Wehner, Sven; Kalff, Jörg C",European journal of medical research,https://doi.org/10.1186/s40001-016-0199-8; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26846568/,424

It was identified based on its cancer-selective antiproliferative activity and subsequently determined to be an aptamer to nucleolin, a multifunctional protein that preferentially binds quadruplex nucleic acids and which is present at high levels on the surface of cancer cells. AS1411 has exceptionally efficient cellular internalization compared to non-quadruplex DNA sequences. SCOPE OF REVIEW Recent developments related to AS1411 will be examined, with a focus on its use for targeted delivery of therapeutic and imaging agents. MAJOR CONCLUSIONS Numerous research groups have used AS1411 as a targeting agent to deliver nanoparticles, oligonucleotides, and small molecules into cancer cells. Studies in animal models have demonstrated that AS1411-linked materials can accumulate selectively in tumors following systemic administration. The mechanism underlying the cancer-targeting ability of AS1411 is not completely understood, but recent studies suggest a model that involves: (1) initial uptake by macropinocytosis, a form of endocytosis prevalent in cancer cells; (2) stimulation of macropinocytosis by a nucleolin-dependent mechanism resulting in further uptake; and (3) disruption of nucleolin-mediated trafficking and efflux leading to cargoes becoming trapped inside cancer cells. SIGNIFICANCE Human trials have indicated that AS1411 is safe and can induce durable remissions in a few patients, but new strategies are needed to maximize its clinical impact. A better understanding of the mechanisms by which AS1411 targets and kills cancer cells may hasten the development of promising technologies using AS1411-linked nanoparticles or conjugates for cancer-targeted therapy and imaging.

Diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines are urgently needed. We model the trimeric Spike protein, including flexible loops and all N-glycosylation sites, in order to elucidate accessible epitopes for antibody-based diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccine development. Based on published experimental data, six homogeneous glycosylation patterns and two heterogeneous ones were used for the analysis. The glycan chains alter the accessible surface areas on the S-protein, impeding antibody-antigen recognition. In presence of glycan, epitopes on the S1 subunit, that notably contains the receptor binding domain, remain mostly accessible to antibodies while those present on the S2 subunit are predominantly inaccessible. We identify 28 B-cell epitopes in the Spike structure and group them as non-affected by the glycan cloud versus those which are strongly masked by the glycan cloud, resulting in a list of favourable epitopes as targets for vaccine development, antibody-based therapy and diagnostics.","Wintjens, René; Bifani, Amanda Makha; Bifani, Pablo",NPJ vaccines,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41541-020-00237-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32944295/,424

This study expected to demonstrate the complexity of correlates associated with children's and adolescents' non-organized PA participation. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA), a systematic review and meta-analysis were applied. Seven electronic databases were systematically searched to identify eligible articles based on a series of inclusion and exclusion criteria. The internal validity of the systematic reviews thus identified was evaluated using a validated quality instrument. Calculations were produced in SPSS 27.0 and Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 3.3. Thirty-nine eligible studies (N = 324,953) with moderate to high quality were included. No potential publication bias was detected using statistical analyses. The meta-analysis revealed that the overall ecological factors correlated positively with children and adolescents' PA; the meta-analytic average of the correlations was ('r = 0.32, p < 0.001). Results from subgroup analysis indicated that theory-based influence factors achieved moderate effect with boys ('r = 0.37, p < 0.001) and girls ('r = 0.32, p < 0.001) in PA participation. Interestingly, higher correlations were found between ecological factors and twins' PA participation ('r = 0.61, p = 0.001). Further, individual ('r = 0.32, p < 0.001), macro-, and chronosystems factors ('r = 0.50, p < 0.001) appeared slightly more influential than microsystems factors ('r = 0.28, p < 0.001) on children and adolescents' PA participation. Although findings from the included studies covered were to some extent heterogeneous, it is possible to identify consistent correlates of PA in children and adolescents. The results supported that PA is a complex and multi-dimensional behavior, which is determined by numerous biological, psychological, sociocultural, and environmental factors. Future studies that focus on the integration effect of macrosystem and chronosystem environmental factors, and apply longitudinal designs and objective measurements are encouraged to further unfold the complexity of the ecological system and its implications in promoting children and adolescents' PA participation.","Li, Longxi; Moosbrugger, Michelle E",International journal of environmental research and public health,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph18179080; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34501670/,424

These findings are identical to those that occur in children with histiocytoid cardiomyopathy, a fatal genetic mitochondrial disorder of Purkinje fibers.

Depends on the place: Corruption and social distancing in American states.,2020-12-03,"Despite hypoxic respiratory failure representing a large portion of total hospitalizations and healthcare spending worldwide, therapeutic options beyond mechanical ventilation are limited. We demonstrate the technical feasibility of providing oxygen to a bulk medium, such as blood, via diffusion across non-porous hollow fiber membranes (HFM) using hyperbaric oxygen. The oxygen transfer across Teflon® membranes was characterized at oxygen pressures up to 2 bars in both a stirred tank vessel (CSTR) and a tubular device mimicking intravenous application. Fluxes over 550 mL min-1 m-2 were observed in well mixed systems, and just over 350 mL min-1 m-2 in flow through tubular systems. Oxygen flux was proportional to the oxygen partial pressure inside the HFM over the tested range and increased with mixing of the bulk liquid. Some bubbles were observed at the higher pressures (1.9 bar) and when bulk liquid dissolved oxygen concentrations were high. High frequency ultrasound was applied to detect and count individual bubbles, but no increase from background levels was detected during lower pressure operation. A conceptual model of the oxygen transport was developed and validated. Model parametric sensitivity studies demonstrated that diffusion through the thin fiber walls was a significant resistance to mass transfer. Promoting convection around the fibers should enable physiologically relevant oxygen supply. This work indicates that a device is within reach that is capable of delivering greater than 10% of a patient's basal oxygen needs in a configuration that readily fits intravascularly.

Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was sent to all national representatives and members of the EUROMENE Core Group and Management Committee. Survey responses were collated and then summarized based on the numbers and percentages of respondents selecting each response option, while weighted average responses were calculated for questions with numerical value response options. Free text responses were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Overall there were 23 responses to the survey from participants across 19 different European countries, with a 95% country-level response rate. Serious concerns were expressed about GPs' knowledge and understanding of ME/CFS, and, it was felt, about 60% of patients with ME/CFS went undiagnosed as a result. The vast majority of GPs were perceived to lack confidence in either diagnosing or managing the condition. Disbelief, and misleading illness attributions, were perceived to be widespread, and the unavailability of specialist centres to which GPs could refer patients and seek advice and support was frequently commented upon. There was widespread support for more training on ME/CFS at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. Conclusion: The results of this survey are consistent with the existing scientific literature. ME/CFS experts report that lack of knowledge and understanding of ME/CFS among GPs is a major cause of missed and delayed diagnoses, which renders problematic attempts to determine the incidence and prevalence of the disease, and to measure its economic impact.

162628,Postal ballot in unconsolidated democracy: Poland's case,2021,"Prostaglandin D2 (PGD2), an eicosanoid with both pro- and anti-inflammatory properties, is the most abundantly expressed prostaglandin in the brain. Here we show that PGD2 signaling through the D-prostanoid receptor 1 (DP1) receptor is necessary for optimal microglia/macrophage activation and IFN expression after infection with a neurotropic coronavirus. Genome-wide expression analyses indicated that PGD2/DP1 signaling is required for up-regulation of a putative inflammasome inhibitor, PYDC3, in CD11b+ cells in the CNS of infected mice. Our results also demonstrated that, in addition to PGD2/DP1 signaling, type 1 IFN (IFN-I) signaling is required for PYDC3 expression. In the absence of Pydc3 up-regulation, IL-1β expression and, subsequently, mortality were increased in infected DP1-/- mice. Notably, survival was enhanced by IL1 receptor blockade, indicating that the effects of the absence of DP1 signaling on clinical outcomes were mediated, at least in part, by inflammasomes. Using bone marrow-derived macrophages in vitro, we confirmed that PYDC3 expression is dependent upon DP1 signaling and that IFN priming is critical for PYDC3 up-regulation. In addition, Pydc3 silencing or overexpression augmented or diminished IL-1β secretion, respectively. Furthermore, DP1 signaling in human macrophages also resulted in the up-regulation of a putative functional analog, POP3, suggesting that PGD2 similarly modulates inflammasomes in human cells. These findings demonstrate a previously undescribed role for prostaglandin signaling in preventing excessive inflammasome activation and, together with previously published results, suggest that eicosanoids and inflammasomes are reciprocally regulated.","Vijay, Rahul; Fehr, Anthony R; Janowski, Ann M; Athmer, Jeremiah; Wheeler, Dorthea L; Grunewald, Matthew; Sompallae, Ramakrishna; Kurup, Samarchith P; Meyerholz, David K; Sutterwala, Fayyaz S; Narumiya, Shuh; Perlman, Stanley",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1704099114; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28630327/,424

163979,Disability and work in a health and economic crisis: Mitigating the risk of long-term labour market exclusion for Australians with disability through policy coordination,2021,"In the last decade, with the new situation forced by the Covide-19 pandemic, the information systems are often forced to work remotely, they must communicate and share confidential data with several interlocutors. In such a context, ensuring the confidentiality of communications becomes a complex and difficult task. Hence, the need to have a flexible system that can adapt with different parameters involved in every exchange of information. We recently presented in [1] a new smart approach to data encryption that serves the same purpose. This approach uses the concept of artificial intelligence and apply BNL skyline algorithm to decide about the most suitable algorithm to ensure the best data privacy. However, with the evolution of dimensions and criteria to be considered for this smart encryption, we find that the complexity of the BNL algorithm increase, then, the response time of the application increase and the skyline encryption quality decreases. In this work, we propose a new idea to resolve this problematic. Indeed, this contribution consists in adding another Intelligence brick to dynamically define the Skyline algorithm depending on the type and number of dimensions. Through this paper, we provide an analysis and a comparison of some skyline algorithms for the multidimensional search. The results obtained by this study show the performance of this new approach whether in terms of execution time or in the quality of the dominant encryption solution. © 2021.

164075,COVID-19: from a global health crisis to a global food crisis?,2020,"Background: In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, schools were forced to close indefinitely with no clue as to when they would reopen. Upon school closures, remote teaching was adopted, with online teaching becoming the most preferred mode of instruction, yet the Information Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure was not adequate enough across the country. Aim: This article scrutinises the remote teaching approaches that were put in place in Zimbabwe in response to the closure of schools during the COVID-19 lockdown. The article investigates how the adopted approaches were suitable for conditions in rural settings. Setting: The study looks at the challenges faced in the implementation of remote teaching during COVID-19 school closures in rural areas of Matabeleland provinces in Zimbabwe. Methods: The study adopted a qualitative phenomenological approach to analyse the teaching approaches that were put in place by the government and other stakeholders. Twenty teachers from 20 rural schools drawn equitably from two provinces, Matabeleland South and Matabeleland North, were interviewed on the shortcomings of these remote teaching approaches. Results: The results revealed that the remote teaching approaches that were put in place excluded learners in rural settings. This is because of the challenges in infrastructure, economic condition and restrictions on remote teaching approaches imposed by the government. Conclusion: As Zimbabwe is facing economic hardships and infrastructure development challenges, it was supposed to adopt emergency remote teaching instead of long-term approaches. A variety of approaches that suit specific physical environments should have been adopted instead of sticking to only one throughout the country.","Nhongo, Raphael Tshotsho Baba P.",Africa's Public Service Delivery and Performance Review,https://doi.org/10.4102/apsdpr.v9i1.482,424

Design/methodology/approach The authors analyse the data of 395 listed manufacturing firms from Pakistan with 2,370 firm-year observations. The sample is divided into subsamples, namely bank-affiliated, non-bank-affiliated and stand-alone firms. Fixed and panel effect regression models are applied to determine the during, pre-crisis and post-crisis effects on corporate capital structure. Findings The robust results of the study reveal that non-bank-affiliated firms have different leverage determinant behaviours with a greater reliance on size, tangibility and profitability. However, bank-affiliated firms seemed to show greater immunity from a crisis compared to other firms. Simultaneously, the stand-alone firms remained at a disadvantage subject to internal financial ties of group-affiliated firms and form a base of market imperfection. Practical implications This study's findings imply that financial managers should contain better ties with financial institutions to enhance financial immunity in worse time of financial crisis or COVID-19 global calamity. On the regulation front, these findings call for critical policy regulations to govern the internal ties with financial institutions to create a level playing field for the corporate sector. Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first to investigate determinants of corporate debt with a particular focus on bank-affiliated and non-bank-affiliated firms. This work is also novel to explore corporate debt of bank-affiliated and non-bank-affiliated firms during the financial crisis.","Zaman, Q. U.; Akhter, W.; Abdul-Majid, M.; Ul Hassan, S.

How to manage the risk of occupational claims in the business environment is the subject of urgent research, especially COVID-19 is ravaging the world and the risk of economic crisis is increasing dramatically. In this study, we collected 1784 cases of food occupational claims from the Chinese legal documents website. Using Excel, Review Manager 5.0 and SPSS 19.0, the number of cases prosecuted as “consumers” were obtained by means of textual analysis, and the development process was directly influenced by occupational claims, with 2017 as a great value point (watershed);the rate of losing occupational claim cases has been climbing since 2018;and the risk of losing occupational claims is higher than that of true meaningful consumer advocacy cases (Z = 6.99, p < 0.001), and in 2019, the risk of losing a case was 33.34 times higher than that of an ordinary consumer. The proportion of occupational claims in the total number of food safety disputes is positively correlated with official protective behavior;the failure rate of occupational claims is positively correlated with official regulatory behavior. The results show that occupational claims are being reexamined by society;the continued rise in the number of unsuccessful occupational claims cases indicates a lack of regulatory guidance for their profit-making behavior, the existence of malicious reporting complaints against business behavior, damage to the business environment, and a certain lack of legality. Therefore, it is proposed that laws and regulations should be in line with international standards, highlight the legal thinking and the concept of the rule of law, return to the original legislative intent, and build a five-in-one mechanism of “consumers, operators, media, government, and justice” to coordinate the management of occupational claims, crack down on occupational claims, and contribute to the creation of a good business environment.","Sun, Jiangjie Gao Yufei Jiang Xueli Li Yan Yang Mengyao Zhao Ziyan Yang Hangzhou You Jinliang",Complexity,https://doi.org/10.1155/2021/6320387,424

With NH residents poor initial vaccine response, the rise of NH breakthrough infections and outbreaks, characterization of the durability of immunity to inform public health policy on the need for boosting is needed. We report on humoral immunity from 2 weeks to 6-months post-vaccination in 120 NH residents and 92 ambulatory healthcare worker controls with and without pre-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 infection. Anti-spike and anti-receptor binding domain (RBD) IgG, and serum neutralization titers, were assessed using a bead-based ELISA method and pseudovirus neutralization assay. Anti-spike, anti-RBD and neutralization levels dropped more than 80% over 6 months time in all groups irrespective of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection. At 6 months post-vaccine, 72% of the infection-naive NH residents had neutralization titers at or below the lower limit of detection compared to 16% at 2 weeks after full vaccination. These data demonstrate a significant reduction in levels of antibody in all groups. In particular, those infection-naive NH residents had lower initial post-vaccination humoral immunity immediately and exhibited the greatest declines 6 months later. Healthcare workers, given their younger age and relative good-health, achieved higher initial antibody levels and better maintained them, yet also experienced significant declines in humoral immunity. Based on the rapid spread of the delta variant and reports of vaccine breakthrough in NH and among younger community populations, boosting NH residents may be warranted.","Canaday, D.

To reach this goal, the manufacturing and logistic processes should be affordable to all countries, irrespectively of economical and climatic conditions. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are bacterial-derived vesicles that can be engineered to incorporate heterologous antigens. Given the inherent adjuvanticity, such modified OMVs can be used as vaccine to induce potent immune responses against the associated protein. Here we show that OMVs engineered to incorporate peptides derived from the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 elicit an effective immune response in immunized mice, resulting in the production of neutralizing antibodies. The immunity induced by the vaccine is sufficient to protect K18-hACE2 transgenic mice from intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2, preventing both virus replication in the lungs and the pathology associated with virus infection. Furthermore, we show that OMVs can be effectively decorated with RBM peptides derived from a different genetic variant of SARS-CoV-2, inducing a similarly potent neutralization activity in vaccinated mice. Altogether, given the convenience associated with ease of engineering, production and distribution, our results demonstrate that OMV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines can be a crucial addition to the vaccines currently available.","Grandi, Alberto; Tomasi, Michele; Bertelli, Cinzia; Vanzo, Teresa; Gagliardi, Assunta; Caproni, Elena; Tamburini, Silvia; Fantappiè, Laura; Di Lascio, Gabriele; Bisoffi, Zeno; Piubelli, Chiara; Valenti, Maria Teresa; Carbonare, Luca Dalle; Zipeto, Donato; Ravà, Micol; Fumagalli, Valeria; Di Lucia, Pietro; Marotta, Davide; Sala, Eleonora; Iannacone, Matteo; Cherepanov, Peter; Bolognesi, Martino; Pizzato, Massimo; Grandi, Guido",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.12.452027,424

One of its key enzymes, similar to other coronaviruses, is the 2′-O-RNA methyltransferase (MTase) that is essential for viral RNA stability and expression. Here, we report the crystal structure of the 2′-O-RNA MTase in a complex with the pan-methyltransferase inhibitor sinefungin solved at 2.2 Å resolution. The structure revealed an overall fold consistent with the fold observed in other coronaviral MTases. The major differences are in the conformation of the C-terminus of the nsp16 subunit and an additional helix in the N-terminus of the nsp10 subunits. The structural analysis also revealed very high conservation of the SAM binding pocket suggesting that the SAM pocket is a suitable spot for the design of antivirals effective against all human coronaviruses. Importance Some coronaviruses are dangerous pathogens while some cause only common colds. The reasons are not understood although the spike proteins probably play an important role. However, to understand the coronaviral biology in sufficient detail we need to compare the key enzymes from different coronaviruses. We solved the crystal structure of 2′-O-RNA methyltransferase of the OC43 coronavirus, a virus that usually causes mild colds. The structure revealed some differences in the overall fold but also revealed that the SAM binding site is conserved suggesting that development of antivirals against multiple coronaviruses is feasible.","Dostalik, Pavel; Krafcikova, Petra; Silhan, Jan; Boura, Evzen",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.16.435745,424

In immunocompromised individuals, conidia can grow out as hyphae that damage lung epithelium. The resulting invasive aspergillosis is associated with devastating mortality rates. Since infection is a race between the innate immune system and the outgrowth of A. fumigatus conidia, we use dynamic optimization to obtain insight into the recruitment and depletion of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils. Using this model, we obtain key insights into major determinants of infection outcome on host and pathogen side. On the pathogen side, we predict in silico and confirm in vitro that germination speed is a key virulence trait of fungal pathogens due to the vulnerability of conidia against host defense. On the host side, we find that epithelial cells play a so far underappreciated role in fungal clearance and are potent mediators of cytokine release which we confirm ex vivo. Further, our model affirms the importance of neutrophils in invasive aspergillosis and underlines that the role of macrophages remains elusive. We expect that our model will contribute to improvement of treatment protocols by focusing on the critical components of immune response to fungi but also fungal virulence.","Ewald, Jan; Rivieccio, Flora; Radosa, Lukáš; Schuster, Stefan; Brakhage, Axel A.; Kaleta, Christoph",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.12.443764,424

Parthanatos is a previously unexplored immunogenic programmed necrosis mechanism that is triggered by the hyperactivation of PARP DNA repair and executed by an efficient DNA-fragmentation mechanism. We developed a proprietary macromolecular zinc complex agent C010DS-Zn that efficiently induced parthanatos against 4T1 murine cancer cells in vitro, which was characterized as PARP-mediated necrotic death with massive DNA damages. Ex vivo screening of its cytotoxicity against a panel of 53 low-passage human solid cancer PDX tumor fragments demonstrated its consistent delivery of characteristically DNA-damaging cell death that was unseen in the corresponding apoptosis positive controls. Further characterization of its in vivo treatment effects versus the immunosuppressive 4T1-Balb/c and immunogenic CT26-Balb/c syngeneic cancer models showed that sufficiently high intravenous C010DS-Zn treatments led to robust initiation of the tumor-suppressed antitumor immune compartments such as T cells and macrophages. At lower non-anticancer doses, C010DS-Zn treatment still led to significantly reduced macrophage content and inflammation in the 4T1 tumor, suggesting its potential utility against macrophage-mediated inflammations such as those seen in MIS-C or COVID19. Given the observation of its low serum bioavailability in a rat pharmacokinetic study, these results suggest potential development opportunities for C010DS-Zn to become a widely applicable immune initiation agent with chemo-like broad applicability upon its pharmacokinetic improvements.","Chung, Jinhyuk Fred; Her, Zhisheng; Kong, Wai Mun; Chen, Qingfeng",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.03.18.433812,424
166884,University Students' Perceptions of their Distance Education Experience during the Covid-19 Pandemic,2021,"The development of effective and flexible vaccine platforms is a major public health challenge as recently highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Adenoviruses (AdVs) are easy to produce and have a good safety and efficacy profile when administered orally as demonstrated by the long-term use of oral AdV 4 and 7 vaccines in the US military. These viruses therefore appear to be the ideal backbone for the development of oral replicative vector vaccines. However, research on these vaccines is limited by the ineffective replication of human AdVs in laboratory animals. The use of mouse AdV type 1 (MAV-1) in its natural host allows infection to be studied under replicative conditions. Here, we orally vaccinated mice with MAV-1 vectors expressing the full length or the “headless” hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza to assess the protection conferred against an intranasal challenge of influenza. We showed that while the headless HA vector did not generate a significant humoral or cellular immune response to influenza, a single oral immunisation with the full-length HA vaccine generated influenza-specific and neutralizing antibodies and completely protected the mice against clinical signs and viral replication. Importance Given the constant threat of pandemics and the need for annual vaccination against influenza and possibly emerging agents such as SARS-CoV-2, new types of vaccines that are easier to produce and administer and therefore more widely accepted are a critical public health need. Here, using a relevant animal model, we have shown that replicative oral AdV vaccine vectors can help make vaccination against major respiratory diseases more available, better accepted and therefore more effective.

Objectives: This study aimed to develop an understanding of what comprises nurse-led care in early RA from the perspective of rheumatology nurse specialists. Methods: This was a qualitative study using semi-structured telephone interviews with rheumatology nurse specialists in England (Summer 2020). Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using inductive thematic analysis.[1] Results: Sixteen nurses were recruited and interviews lasted between 30 to 60 minutes. Seven themes were identified. Early disease management Care was characterised by evidence-based RA management provided by experienced nurse specialists with a high degree of autonomy, in the context of a rheumatology multidisciplinary team. The aims of care were to: start treatment, keep in treatment, educate and support. 'So treat to target.escalating treatment as necessary, and addressing any concerns that the patients might have' (CNS14) Addressing psychosocial needs Patients with early RA experience shock, fear, anger, grief and denial while feeling unwell with pain and fatigue. Nurses use a holistic, person-centred and empathetic approach to address psychosocial needs, building a working relationship, listening and creating trust. 'Because it all relates, and if they're stressed because they're not coping at work, then their arthritis isn't going to be so good. So everything relates to one another really' (CNS06) Monitoring treatment, disease impact and patient outcomes Nurses monitor disease activity and disease impact using validated outcome measures and by asking questions during the consultation. Good outcomes are disease control, managing disease impact, medication and side effects, wellbeing and keeping in work. 'When you get them stable, when you get them into remission, when they're happy, when they're feeling well, I think there's lots of ways you can measure that'. (CNS13) Coordinating care, referring and signposting Nurses coordinate care, refer to other health professionals and signpost patients to relevant services and charities. Lack of access to psychology expertise was highlighted. 'And whilst most of us have got some degree of understanding of.self management, or psychology.we're not psychologists' (CNS02) Providing a 'lifeline' Nurse-led telephone advice services provide a 'lifeline' for patients. If patients struggle, they can call and speak with a specialist who knows them and their RA well. 'The advice line has been a lifeline to them, to be able to speak to someone, to be able to get a response quickly to their questions, they feel very well supported, they know that they can always call us' (CNS16) Service evaluation and auditing The individual clinics are reviewed regularly. Patients are asked for feedback on their experience of appointments, if their needs were met and about changes to the service. .'It's really important to ask them initially what they expect to have from the consultation.We've always had really good feedback in general'. (CNS02) COVID-19 challenges and opportunities The pandemic caused major disruptions to the services, prohibiting most faceto-face consultations which was an essential aspect of clinical assessments. Despite the challenges imposed by the pandemic, the services adapted fast, using telephone, video clinics and digital solutions, which streamlined procedures and improved documentation and communication. 'I do have to rely on them telling me what's going on, because I can't see it at the moment' (CNS14) 'With Covid we're doing it over the telephone, and we're getting them to watch the video [injection tutorial] before we have the appointment with them' (CNS04) Conclusion: Nurse-led care in early arthritis is a specialist service, addressing complex needs of patients, using evidence based and person-centred approaches.

Here, the p26 movement protein from Pea enation mosaic virus 2 (PEMV2) was found to phase separate and partition in nucleoli and G3BP stress granules (SGs) in vivo. Electrostatic interactions drive p26 phase separation as mutation of basic (R/K-G) or acidic (D/E-G) residues either blocked or reduced phase separation, respectively. During infection, p26 must partition inside the nucleolus and interact with fibrillarin (Fib2) as a pre-requisite for systemic trafficking of viral RNAs. Partitioning of p26 in pre-formed Fib2 droplets was dependent on p26 phase separation suggesting that phase separation of viral movement proteins supports nucleolar partitioning and virus movement. Furthermore, viral ribonucleoprotein complexes containing p26, Fib2, and PEMV2 RNA were formed via phase separation in vitro and could provide the basis for self-assembly in planta. Interestingly, both R/K-G and D/E-G p26 mutants failed to support systemic trafficking of a Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) vector in Nicotiana benthamiana suggesting that p26 phase separation, proper nucleolar partitioning, and systemic movement are intertwined. p26 also partitioned in SGs and G3BP over-expression restricted PEMV2 accumulation >20-fold. Expression of phase separation-deficient G3BP only restricted PEMV2 5-fold, demonstrating that G3BP phase separation is critical for maximum antiviral activity. AUTHOR SUMMARY Phase separation of several cellular proteins is associated with forming pathological aggregates and exacerbating neurodegenerative disease progression. In contrast, roles for viral protein phase separation in RNA virus lifecycles are less understood. Here, we demonstrate that the p26 movement protein from Pea enation mosaic virus 2 phase separates and partitions with phase-separated cellular proteins fibrillarin and G3BP. The related orthologue from Groundnut rosette virus has been extensively studied and is known to interact with fibrillarin in the nucleolus as a pre-requisite for virus movement. We determined that basic residues and electrostatic interactions were critical for p26 phase separation. Furthermore, mutation of charged residues prevented the rescue of a movement-deficient Tobacco mosaic virus vector in Nicotiana benthamiana. Stress granules form through phase separation and we found that p26 could partition inside stress granules following heat shock. Phase separation of the stress granule nucleator G3BP was required for maximum antiviral activity and constitutes a host response that is dependent on cellular protein phase separation. Collectively, we demonstrate that phase separation of a plant virus protein facilitates virus-host interactions that are required for virus movement and phase separation of cellular proteins can simultaneously restrict virus replication.","Brown, Shelby L.; May, Jared P.",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.11.443547,424

Mortality and morbidity rates are increasing-up to now. Although convalescent plasma therapy can be thought to be useful in the treatment of COVID-19, it carries potential risks, such as transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI). In COVID-19 infection, tachypnea, tachycardia, increased need for oxygenation, and the presence of bilateral widespread infiltrates on radiological imagings are evaluated as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This clinical situation may develop independently from disease progression in patients receiving convalescent plasma therapy and it is called TRALI.

169410,A media visibility analysis of public leadership in Scandinavian responses to pandemics,2021,"Background International asthma guidelines recommend against adrenaline administration in acute asthma unless associated with anaphylaxis or angioedema. However, administration of intra-muscular adrenaline in addition to nebulised selective {beta}2-agonist is recommended for acute severe or life-threatening asthma in many pre-hospital guidelines. We conducted a systematic review to determine the efficacy of adrenaline in comparison to selective {beta}2-agonist in acute asthma. Methods We included peer-reviewed publications of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that enrolled children or adults in any healthcare setting and compared adrenaline by any route to selective {beta}2-agonist by any route for an acute asthma exacerbation. The primary outcome was treatment failure, as indicated by hospitalisation, stay >24hrs in emergency department, need for intubation, or death. Results Thirty-eight of 1,140 studies were included, involving 2,275 participants. Overall quality of evidence was low. There was significant statistical heterogeneity, I2=56%. The pooled odds ratio for treatment failure with adrenaline versus selective {beta}2-agonist was 0.99 (0.74 to 1.34), p=0.96. There was strong evidence that recruitment age-group was associated with different estimates of the risk of treatment failure; with studies recruiting adults-only having a lower risk of treatment failure with adrenaline. It was not possible to determine whether adrenaline in addition to selective {beta}2-agonist improved outcomes. Conclusion The limited evidence available suggests that adrenaline and selective {beta}2-agonists have similar efficacy in acute asthma and does not support the use of adrenaline in addition to selective {beta}2-agonists in acute asthma. There is a need for high-quality double-blind RCTs to address this issue.

169823,Training nurses to perform water swallow test with use of standardised patients,2021,"Aim and objective: To review the success of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) in the management of caries in children. Background: The current concept of caries management is based on a biological approach. When it comes to children with early childhood caries, managing their behavior along with effective and comprehensive caries management is necessary for which an algorithm-based approach is discussed. Silver diamine fluoride acts as a tertiary preventive procedure that reduces the negative consequences of established disease (cavity) and restores, thus improving the child’s quality of life. It is a magic bullet that comprises antibacterial actions of silver and remineralizing effects of highly concentrated fluoride. Review results: Previous systematic reviews have reported the success of SDF in arresting caries in primary teeth and root caries in adults. Caries removal is not a prerequisite;therefore, SDF application is suitable when other modalities of caries management are unavailable or impractical. Apart from staining the arrested lesion black, no significant complication of SDF use among children was reported. Conclusion: Even though the black staining was unappealing, a significant number of parents chose SDF over advanced pharmacological behavior management techniques and it is really the magic alternative in children as it supports the contemporary “biological approach” for caries management. Clinical significance: In such times of the COVID-19 pandemic, SDF allows the interruption of aerosol-generating procedures and serves as interim treatment procedure to arrest dentin caries to prevent development of pulpitis which further requires intervention using aerotor. Most of all, SDF application is child-friendly and provides exceptional success rates when used where indicated. © Jaypee Brothers Medical Publishers. 2021.","Singhania, S.; Bhojraj, N.; Shanbhog, R.",World Journal of Dentistry,https://doi.org/10.5005/jp-journals-10015-1845,424

VDJ recombination follows probabilistic rules that can be modeled statistically. So far, it remains unknown whether VDJ recombination rules differ between individuals. If these rules differed, identical (auto)antigen-specific Ig sequences would be generated with individual-specific probabilities, signifying that the available Ig sequence space is individual-specific. We devised a sensitivity-tested distance measure that enables inter-individual comparison of VDJ recombination models. We discovered, accounting for several sources of noise as well as allelic variation in Ig sequencing data, that not only unrelated individuals but also human monozygotic twins and even inbred mice possess statistically distinguishable immunoglobulin recombination models. This suggests that, in addition to genetic, there is also non-genetic modulation of VDJ recombination. We demonstrate that population-wide individualized VDJ recombination can result in orders of magnitude of difference in the probability to generate (auto)antigen-specific Ig sequences. Our findings have implications for immune receptor-based individualized medicine approaches relevant to vaccination, infection, and autoimmunity.","Slabodkin, Andrei; Chernigovskaya, Maria; Mikocziova, Ivana; Akbar, Rahmad; Scheffer, Lonneke; Pavlović, Milena; Bashour, Habib; Snapkov, Igor; Mehta, Brij Bhushan; Weber, Cédric R.; Gutierrez-Marcos, Jose; Sollid, Ludvig M.; Haff, Ingrid Hobæk; Sandve, Geir Kjetil; Robert, Philippe A.; Greiff, Victor",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.19.440409,424

For air transport, in particular, airlines stopped flying altogether and were forced to ground hundreds of planes worldwide involuntarily. Airports had to close their terminals for a long time, wholly suspend operations, and its resumption required significant organizational changes. This article summarizes the measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic adopted by airports to minimize the risk of spreading the disease. The article focuses on countermeasures and their implementation at selected airports in a specific time frame and airports’ behavior during a pandemic which varies depending on country and time of the year. The results demonstrated that steps being taken at airports include the use of face coverings or masks, social distance, enhanced cleaning and disinfection, or temperature checks and/or symptoms (fever, loss of smell, chills, cough, shortness of breath), RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) screening and data collection with health declaration. These measures have now become an essential standard for the operation of airports and can, therefore, be used to assess the level of airport safety achieved. In the final phase, the article evaluates the level of achieved airport safety based on the proposed scoring method.","Blišťanová, Monika Tirpáková Michaela Brůnová Ľubomíra",Sustainability,https://doi.org/10.3390/su13158499,424

However, the presence of organics may severely depress the functional effects of melatonin. By rendering deionized water (DIW) flow through gold nano-particles under localized surface plasmon resonant illumination, we developed plasmon-activated water (PAW) which successfully increases the solubility of melatonin to 150.325%. Melatonin dissolved in PAW also exhibits stronger anti-viral and anti-oxidative activities than that dissolved in DIW in which the percentage of dengue virus infected human hepatocellular carcinoma cells is remarkably decreased (14.7% vs. 20.6%) whilst the clearance rate of hydroxyl radical is significantly enhanced (11.9% vs. 6.69%), respectively. Moreover, in vivo approaches further show that following chronic sleep deprivation, the level of oxidative stress, hepatic bioenergetics, anti-oxidative enzyme activity, and metabolic function are all significantly improved in rats received melatonin prepared in PAW than that in DIW. As the bio-activity of melatonin depends largely on its solubility, utilizing PAW as a non-organic solvent will not only enhance the anti-viral and anti-oxidative function of melatonin, but also offer great potential for clinical use of melatonin as a therapeutic strategy to depress virus infection and counteract oxidative damage in a more natural, more economic and more efficient way.","Renn, Ting-Yi Yang Chin-Ping Wu Un-In Chen Li-You Mai Fu-Der Tikhonova Maria A.; Amstislavskaya, Tamara G.; Liao, Wen-Chieh Lin Che-Tong Liu Yu-Chuan Chang Hung-Ming",Chemical Engineering Journal,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2021.131626,424
172573,Teaching and Learning during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Topic Modeling Study,2021,"With the outbreak and wide spread of novel coronavirus (COVID-19), contactless fingerprint recognition has attracted more attention for personal recognition because it can provide significantly higher user convenience and hygiene than the traditional contact-based fingerprint recognition. However, it is still challenging to achieve a highly accurate recognition due to the low ridge-valley contrast and pose variances of contactless fingerprints. Minutiae points are a kind of ridge flow discontinuities, and robust and accurate extraction is an important step for most automatic fingerprint recognition algorithms. Most of existing methods are based on two stages which locate the minutiae points first and then compute their directions. The two-stage method cannot make full use of location and direction information. In this paper, we propose a multi-task fully deep convolutional neural network for jointly learning the minutiae location detection and its corresponding direction computation which operates directly on the whole gray scale contactless fingerprints. The proposed method consists of offline training and online testing stages. In the training stage, a fully deep convolutional neural network is built for the tasks of minutiae detection and its direction regression, with an attention mechanism to make the direction regression branch concentrate on the minutiae points. A new loss function is proposed to jointly learn the tasks of minutiae detection and its direction regression from the whole fingerprints. In the testing stage, the trained network is applied on the whole contactless fingerprint to generate the minutiae location and direction maps. The proposed multi-task leaning method performs better than the individual single task and it operates directly on the raw gray-scale contactless fingerprints without preprocessing. The results on three contactless fingerprint datasets show the proposed algorithm performs better than other minutiae extraction algorithms and the commercial software. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Zhang, Z.; Liu, S.; Liu, M.",Pattern Recognition,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2021.108189,424
172666,The Effect of Pandemic News on Stock Market Returns During the Covid-19 Crash: Evidence from International Markets,2021,"While molecular targeted therapies have improved prognoses of advanced stage lung adenocarcinoma expressing oncogenic driver mutations, acquired therapeutic resistance continues to be a major problem. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) activating mutations are among the most common targetable genetic alterations in lung adenocarcinoma, and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are recommended first-line therapy for EGFR mutation positive cancer patients. Unfortunately, most patients develop resistance to EGFR TKIs and rapid disease progression occurs. A better mechanistic understanding of therapy refractory cancer progression is necessary to develop new therapeutic approaches to predict and prevent acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. Here, we identify a new mechanism of ERBB3-mediated resistance to EGFR TKIs in human lung adenocarcinoma. Specifically, we show that dopamine and cyclic AMP-regulated phosphoprotein, Mr 32000 (DARPP-32) physically recruits ERBB3 to EGFR to mediate a switch from EGFR homodimers to EGFR:ERBB3 heterodimers to bypass EGFR TKI-mediated inhibition to potentiate ERBB3-dependent activation of oncogenic AKT and ERK signaling that drives therapy refractory tumor cell survival. In a cohort of paired tumor specimens derived from 30 lung adenocarcinoma patients before and after the development of EGFR TKI refractory disease progression, we reveal that DARPP-32 as well as kinase-activated EGFR and ERBB3 proteins are overexpressed upon acquired EGFR TKI resistance. In vivo studies suggest that ablation of DARPP-32 protein activity sensitizes gefitinib-resistant lung tumor xenografts to EGFR TKI treatment, while DARPP-32 overexpression increases gefitinib-refractory lung cancer progression in gefitinib-sensitive lung tumors orthotopically xenografted into mice. Taken together, our findings introduce a DARPP-32-mediated, ERBB3-dependent mechanism used by lung tumor cells to evade EGFR TKI-induced cell death, potentially paving the way for the development of new therapies to prevent or overcome therapy-refractory lung adenocarcinoma progression.","Alam, Sk.

173646,The Value of Ethnographic Research on Music: An Introduction,2021,"Coevolution-based contact prediction, either directly by coevolutionary couplings resulting from global statistical sequence models or using structural supervision and deep learning, has found widespread application in protein-structure prediction from sequence. However, one of the basic assumptions in global statistical modeling is that sequences form an at least approximately independent sample of an unknown probability distribution, which is to be learned from data. In the case of protein families, this assumption is obviously violated by phylogenetic relations between protein sequences. It has turned out to be notoriously difficult to take phylogenetic correlations into account in coevolutionary model learning. Here, we propose a complementary approach: we develop strategies to randomize or resample sequence data, such that conservation patterns and phylogenetic relations are preserved, while intrinsic (i.e. structure- or function-based) coevolutionary couplings are removed. A comparison between the results of Direct Coupling Analysis applied to real and to resampled data shows that the largest coevolutionary couplings, i.e. those used for contact prediction, are only weakly influenced by phylogeny. However, the phylogeny-induced spurious couplings in the resampled data are compatible in size with the first false-positive contact predictions from real data. Dissecting functional from phylogeny-induced couplings might therefore extend accurate contact predictions to the range of intermediate-size couplings. The code is available at https://github.com/ed-rodh/Null_models_I_and_II. Author summary Many homologous protein families contain thousands of highly diverged amino-acid sequences, which fold into close-to-identical three-dimensional structures and fulfill almost identical biological tasks. Global coevolutionary models, like those inferred by the Direct Coupling Analysis (DCA), assume that families can be considered as samples of some unknown statistical model, and that the parameters of these models represent evolutionary constraints acting on protein sequences. To learn these models from data, DCA and related approaches have to also assume that the distinct sequences in a protein family are close to independent, while in reality they are characterized by involved hierarchical phylogenetic relationships. Here we propose Null models for sequence alignments, which maintain patterns of amino-acid conservation and phylogeny contained in the data, but destroy any coevolutionary couplings, frequently used in protein structure prediction. We find that phylogeny actually induces spurious non-zero couplings. These are, however, significantly smaller that the largest couplings derived from natural sequences, and therefore have only little influence on the first predicted contacts. However, in the range of intermediate couplings, they may lead to statistically significant effects. Dissecting phylogenetic from functional couplings might therefore extend the range of accurately predicted structural contacts down to smaller coupling strengths than those currently used.","Horta, Edwin Rodriguez; Weigt, Martin",bioRxiv,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.08.12.247577,424

Position paper of the Spanish society for bone research and mineral metabolism (SEIOMM),2021,"Purpose: Phantoms are a basic tool for assessing and verifying performance in CT research and clinical practice. Patient-based realistic lung phantoms accurately representing textures and densities are essential in developing and evaluating novel CT hardware and software. This study introduces PixelPrint, a 3D printing solution to create patient-based lung phantoms with accurate attenuation profiles and textures. Methods: PixelPrint, a software tool, was developed to convert Patient DICOM images directly into printer instructions (G-code). The density was modeled as the ratio of filament to voxel volume to emulate attenuation profiles for each voxel. A calibration phantom was designed to determine the mapping between filament line width and Hounsfield Units (HU) within the range of human lungs. For evaluation of PixelPrint, a phantom based on a human lung slice was manufactured and scanned with the same CT scanner and protocol used for the patient scan. Density and geometrical accuracy between phantom and patient CT data was evaluated for various anatomical features in the lung. Results: For the calibration phantom, measured mean Hounsfield units show a very high level of linear correlation with respect to the utilized filament line widths, (r > 0.999). Qualitatively, the CT image of the patient-based phantom closely resembles the original CT image both in texture and contrast levels, with clearly visible vascular and parenchymal structures. Regions-of-interest (ROIs) comparing attenuation illustrated differences below 15 HU. Manual size measurements performed by an experienced thoracic radiologist reveal a high degree of geometrical correlation of details between identical patient and phantom features, with differences smaller than the intrinsic spatial resolution of the scans. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates the feasibility of 3D printed patient-based lung phantoms with accurate organ geometry, image texture, and attenuation profiles. PixelPrint will enable applications in the research and development of CT technology, including further development in radiomics.","Mei, K.; Geagen, M.; Roshkovan, L.; Litt, H. I.; Gang, G.

However, the current COVID-19 pandemic and dynamic changes in the curriculum have created a significant shift of emphasis to educators. Hence, the teaching and learning process problems nowadays, including selecting appropriate effectiveness learning, have become a tough decision for educators. It can be solved using multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. The MCDM technique is widely applied and accepted in various fields but less in the teaching and learning context. This paper reviews and analyses the type of decision problems that were paid most attention to MCDM approaches, the adopted fuzzy set theory as well as inadequacies of those approaches. The purpose is to analyse and identify the literature review related to the applications of MCDM in education so new attributes and appropriate MCDM models for decision making can be suggested. The process involved comparing and analysing the MCDM application and fuzzy set theory in education by reviewing related articles in international scientific journals and well-known international conferences. Some improvements and more future works are recommended based on the inadequacies. The reviewed result may create an interest to the Ministry of Education (MoE) as it proposes teaching and learning process improvement, which will help to achieve greater satisfaction among educators and students.","Durrani Aimi Abdul, Malik Yusof Yuhani Ku Muhammad Na’im Ku Khalif",Journal of Physics: Conference Series,https://doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1988/1/012063,424

I argue that our present poses a challenge similar to that posed by WWI;a collapse of the frameworks around which subjectivities and societies are organized, and a potential for the development of both better and worse outlooks. I argue that as was the case then, psychoanalysis has crucial theoretical and ethical choices to make. I suggest that rather than follow Freud's death driven fatalism, we should seek inspiration in Bloch's view of hope as a driving force of human experience and destiny.

It is critical to detect and isolate the positive cases as early as possible for timely treatment to prevent the further spread of the virus. It was found in few early studies that patients present abnormalities in chest radiography images that are characteristic of those infected with COVID-19. In the current con, a rapid, accessible and automated screening tool based on image processing of chest X-rays (CXRs) would be much needed as a quick alternative to PCR testing, especially with commonly available X-ray machines and without the dedicated test kits in labs and hospitals. Several classifications based approaches have been proposed recently with encouraging results to detect pneumonia based on CXRs using supervised deep transfer learning techniques based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These black box approaches are mainly non-interactive in nature and their prediction represents just a cue to the radiologist. This work focuses on issues related to the development of such an automated system for CXRs by performing discriminative feature learning using deep neural networks with a purely data driven approach and retrieving images based on an unknown query image and performing retrieval evaluation on currently available benchmark datasets towards the goal of realistic comparison and real clinical integration. The system is trained and tested on an image collection of 1700 CXRs obtained from two different resources with encouraging results based on precision and recall measures in individual deep feature spaces.

Coronavirus disease, caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, is causing serious problems related to public health and socioeconomic status across the globe. Having started in Asia, the disease has already reached Europe, Africa, and more recently the Americas;hence, it is necessary to understand the context in which it spreads in regions that carry high risks associated with social vulnerability, as in the case of Latin America. Brazil is the South American country most affected by the pandemic-its first case was confirmed at the end of February 2020, and in less than two months, its total number of cases has already crossed 25,000. Among its worst-hit states, Ceara in Northeast Brazil worries health agencies as there have already been more than 2,000 cases in the 30 days of the outbreak in the state.

However, the effects of lockdown on firearm violence have yet to be studied. Within this context, this study analyzes reports of gunshots in Mexico City registered on Twitter from October 2018 to 2019 (pre-COVID-19) and from October 2019 to 2020 (during COVID-19), using a combination of spatial (nearest neighbor ratio, Ripley’s K function and kernel estimation) and non-spatial (Fisher’s exact test) methods. The results indicate a spatial concentration of gunshot reports in Mexico City and a reduction in frequency of reports during the pandemic. While they show no change in the overall concentration of gunshots during lockdown, they do indicate an expansion in the patterns of spatial intensity (moving from the west to the center of the city). One possible explanation is the capacity of possible victims of firearm crimes in certain municipalities to comply with lockdown measures and thus avoid exposure to such crimes.","García-Tejeda, Enrique Fondevila Gustavo Siordia Oscar S.",ISPRS International Journal of Geo-Information,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi10080540,424

The activity of SOD and ascorbic acid levels were significantly higher in tissues of RJX-P or RJX-B treated rats than vehicle-treated control rats (p <0.0001). There was no statistically significant difference between tissues SOD activity or ascorbic acid levels of rats treated with RJX-P vs. rats treated with RJX-B (p >0.05). The observed elevations of the SOD and ascorbic acid levels were transient and were no longer detectable on day 28 following a 14-day recovery period.

Different from the $H_1N_1$ pandemic, which had a deadly wave and cessed, the new disease is maintained by successive waves, mainly produced by new virus variants, and the small number of vaccinated people. In the present work, we create a version of the SIR model with spatial localization of persons, their movements, and taking into account social isolation probabilities. We discuss the effects of virus variants, and the role of vaccination rate in the pandemic dynamics.

These positive trends are supported by factors such as worsening epidemiological situation in the world due to COVID-19 and transition to self-isolation of the majority of population, which requires providing healthy green products for a functional purpose. It is the need to strengthen the immune system that makes people consume vegetable products in accordance with the recommendations for rational consumption of vegetables that meet modern requirements for a healthy diet. To effectively solve the problem and in connection with the limitation of the imported products supply, the most rational solution is to modernize our domestic production of functional vegetable crops. The design of modern small-scale cultivation facilities makes it possible to ensure food security of various segments of the population living in any part of the Russian Federation. The structure autonomy and energy-saving technologies enable to operate the bio-vegetation complex all year round without being connected to an external power system. This is achieved due to the rational distribution of energy flows in the complex itself, and enables to efficiently operate it all the year round without serious additional financial costs for energy supply in the cold season. The paper presents energy-saving solutions and describes a thermophysical model of energy flows movement being an indispensable element in the design of such structures.","Yudaev, I. V.; Popov, M.

However, these new programs run the risk of paying insufficient attention to the multiple sustainability crises we face. Climate change, in particular, threatens the very basis for continued human prosperity and requires an equal, if not greater, societal mobilization. In this policy brief, we argue that the response to the coronavirus outbreak also offers an opportunity to advance the climate agenda. Indeed, given that we have scarce resources at our disposal, it is essential that we synergize such efforts. We propose that this can be accomplished in two primary ways: (1) harnessing the disruptive forces of the COVID-19 pandemic to accelerate the decline of carbon-intensive industries, technologies, and practices, and (2) leveraging responses to drive low-carbon innovation. From these two strategies, we outline five principles of “sustainability transition policy” to serve as a guide during these challenging times.","Markard, Jochen; Rosenbloom, Daniel",Sustainability Sci.

For infants living in settings with high child-mortality, and also for rural and remote Australian Aboriginal infants, clinical protection conferred by two doses of Rotarix appear to be reduced. We assessed the effect of an additional dose of Rotarix on vaccine immune responses among Aboriginal children who are 6 to < 12 months old. Methods: ORVAC is a two-stage, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial conducted across regional urban and remote locations of Australia's Northern Territory. Aboriginal children aged 6 to < 12 months old who had received one or two prior doses of Rotarix were randomised 1:1 to receive an additional dose of Rotarix or matched placebo. The primary immunological endpoint was seroresponse defined as an anti-rotavirus IgA level < 20 AU/ml, approximately one month following Rotarix or placebo. Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02941107). Findings: Between March 2018 and August 2020, 253 infants were enrolled. Of these, 178 infants (70%) had analysable serological results after follow-up; 89 randomised to Rotarix and 89 randomised to placebo. The proportion with a seroresponse was 85% after Rotarix compared to 71% after placebo; the probability of a higher seroresponse in the Rotarix than the placebo arm was 99%. There was no occurrences of intussusception or any serious adverse events attributed to Rotarix or placebo in the 28 days following the additional dose of Rotarix or placebo. Interpretation: An additional dose of Rotarix among Australian Aboriginal infants 6 to < 12 months old increased the proportion with a vaccine seroresponse. If it can be proven that this translates into better protection against disease, scheduling an additional dose may be a viable strategy for further reducing the global burden of rotavirus disease.","Middleton, B.

The restrictions reduced the flow of traffic in the city but did not have a major impact on the large industries and power plants. In the areas with a complex profile of emission sources, traffic restriction measures alone may hardly tackle serious air pollution. This natural experiment allowed us to test how the reduction in transport movement affects air quality in Ust-Kamenogorsk, as there is a tendency to hold transport as being a major cause of air pollution in Ust-Kamenogorsk. This study analyzes concentrations of four major air pollutants and meteorological parameters in Ust-Kamenogorsk from March 1 to May 15 in 2016–2020. Using the fixed effects model, we find that restrictions have decreased the levels of CO by 21–23 percent, increased the levels of TSP by 13–21 percent, and had no significant effect on SO2 and NO2 concentrations in the city. It implies that heavy pollution in the city with SO2, NO2, TSP are mainly caused by non-transportrelated sources. © The Author(s).","Assanov, D.; Kerimray, A.; Batkeyev, B.; Kapsalyamova, Z.",Aerosol and Air Quality Research,https://doi.org/10.4209/aaqr.200663,424

Thus, it is time to explore and design an intelligent model to monitor patient health symptoms remotely and predict and detect the abnormality of the patient&#x2019;s health status in quick succession. Thus, the health status of a coronavirus-affected patient can be identified via a well-adjusted predictive model by analyzing the observed parameters of the health. In the proposed model, an Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average is incorporated to design a predictive model to find the kth forecast of the observed health symptoms of a patient, and Akaike Information Criteria based selection is introduced to find the current best-fit prediction model. Further, the features are extracted from the forecast over each symptom to find a pattern of each patient, and the patterns are learned by the K-Means algorithm to detect the symptomatic and asymptomatic patient intelligently. To demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed model, we evaluate the model using a synthetic dataset, generated from the health symptoms of 400 patients and compare the performance of the model with the standard methods.

We aimed to investigate patient and staff acceptability of video triage, and the safety of the decision-making process.MethodsThis service evaluation utilised a mixture of routine 999 call and bespoke data collection from participating clinicians who logged calls they both attempted and undertook. We sent postal surveys to a group of patients who were recipients of a video triage.ResultsBetween 27th March 2020 and 25th August 2020 clinicians documented 1073 video triage calls. A successful video triage call was achieved in 641 (59.7%) of cases. Clinical staff reported that video triage improved clinical assessment and decision making compared to telephone alone, and found the technology accessible for patients. Patients who received a video triage call and responded to the survey (40/201, 19.9%) viewed the technology, the ambulance staff and the care planning favourably.Callers receiving video triage that ended with a disposition of ‘hear and treat’, had a lower rate of re-contacting the service within 24 hours compared to callers that received clinical support desk telephone triage alone (16/212, 7.5% vs 2508/14349, 17.5% respectively.)ConclusionIn this single NHS Ambulance Trust evaluation, the use of video triage for low acuity calls appeared to be safe, with low rates of recontact and high levels of patient and clinician satisfaction compared to standard telephone triage. However, video triage is not always appropriate or acceptable to patients and technical issues were not uncommon.","Bell, Fiona Pilbery Richard Connell Rob Fletcher Dean Leatherland Tracy Cottrell Linda Webster Peter",Emergency Medicine Journal : EMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/emermed-2021-999.35,424

180871,Xenophobia during the pandemic: A Lacanian perspective,2021,"Background: To reach global immunization goals, national programs need to balance routine immunization at health facilities with vaccination campaigns and other outreach activities (e.g. vaccination weeks), which boost coverage at particular times and help reduce geographic inequalities. However, where routine immunization is weak, an overreliance on vaccination campaigns may lead to heterogeneous coverage. Here, we assessed the impact of a health system strengthening (HSS) intervention on the relative contribution of routine immunization and outreach activities to reach immunization goals in rural Madagascar. Methods: We obtained data from health centers in Ifanadiana district on the monthly number of recommended vaccines (BCG, measles, DTP and Polio) delivered to children, during 2014-2018. We also analyzed data from a district-representative cohort carried out every two years in over 1500 households in 2014-2018. We compared changes inside and outside the HSS catchment in the delivery of recommended vaccines, population-level vaccination coverage, geographic and economic inequalities in coverage, and timeliness of vaccination. The impact of HSS was quantified via mixed-effects logistic regressions. Results: The HSS intervention was associated with a significant increase in immunization rates (Odds Ratio between 1.22 for measles and 1.49 for DTP), which diminished over time. Outreach activities were associated with a doubling in immunization rates, but their effect was smaller in the HSS catchment. Analysis of cohort data revealed that HSS was associated with higher vaccination coverage (Odds Ratio between 1.18 per year of HSS for measles and 1.43 for BCG), a reduction in economic inequality, and a higher proportion of timely vaccinations. Yet, the lower contribution of outreach activities in the HSS catchment was associated with persistent inequalities in geographic coverage, which prevented achieving international coverage targets. Conclusion: Investment in stronger primary care systems can improve vaccination coverage, reduce inequalities and improve the timeliness of vaccination via increases in routine immunizations.","Rajaonarifara, E.; Bond, M.

It has affected all walks of life;with its immense contagiosity, diverse and intriguing pathogenesis and manifestations differing from other viruses. It has indeed left humanity in dark, unchartered waters;particularly in the early months of the pandemic. Objectives: This article shares the experience, in a Rheumatology department in a District General Hospital (DGH) in the United Kingdom, of managing patients on Biologic (b) and Targeted Synthetic (ts) DMARDs, in the midst of the COVID-19 Pandemic. Methods: All Rheumatology patients at the Princess Alexandra Hospital (PAH) in Harlow newly started on a biologic or targeted synthetic DMARD between 3rd July and 3rd Oct 2020 were identified. These patients had active inflammatory arthritis. Each patient was discussed in a dedicated Multi-Disciplinary Team (MDT) meeting and a consensus on treatment reached in-line with local and National guidelines. Results: Of the 50 patients identified;39 had Rheumatoid Arthritis, 6 had Ankylosing Spondylitis and 5 had Psoriatic Arthritis. Of these 50 patients, 5 patients decided against treatment during the stage of 'Enhanced Verbal Consent'. These patients were flaring recurrently and were in regular contact with the department. However, they were afraid to start new Biologic treatment because of the risks of Covid-19. The breakdown of the biologic agents used in the remaining 45 patients were as follows: Adalimumab:11, Rituximab: 10, Etanercept: 9, Tofacitinib: 11, Tocilizumab SC: 3, Tocilizumab IV: 1, Sarilumab: 2, Secukinumab: 1, Infliximab: 1, Baricitinib: 1, Apremilast: 1Conclusion: The over-riding principle that guided the Department during the COVID crisis was: primum non nocere (first, do no harm). The adherence to the Case Based Discussions (CBDs) positively impacted on decision making, ensuring safe initiation of Biologic DMARDs even during the height of the pandemic. This is vital to achieve early disease remission. The MDT meetings comprising Doctors, Specialist Pharmacist and Nurse Specialists ensured prompt risk stratification of individual patients. It gave patients the opportunity to be part of the decision-making -evident in the five of the fifty patients, who opted to defer the start date of their treatments. The choice of the new Biologic agent was based on the latest National COVID-19 guidelines. The agents with the shortest half-life were selected. Moreover, patients for Rituximab were given one pulsed infusion, as opposed to two infusions.

A 62% decrease in admissions was noted for angina pectoris and acute coronary syndromes and a 46% decrease in admissions for stroke and transient ischemic attack. A meaningful decrease was found in coronary angioplasties (59%) and total percutaneous interventions (65%), and also a decrease in general surgeries (73%), and cardiac surgeries (58%). Although social distancing measures are a key public health strategy to flatten the infection curve, the observed decrease in medical visits and interventions may impact negatively on cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and cancer related morbidity and mortality. A collective effort is required to avoid the unintended consequences and collateral damage of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Bozovich, Gerardo E; Alves De Lima, Alberto; Fosco, Matías; Burgos, Lucrecia M; Martínez, Roberto; Dupuy De Lôme, Roberto; Torn, Andrés; Sala Mercado, Javier",Medicina,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32658846/,424

METHOD 1291 hospital records of clinically diagnosed SARS patients with complete data gathered from ""2003 Beijing SARS Clinical Database"" were analyzed. RESULTS SARS cases were categorized into four groups, according to the time of hospitalization after onset of the disease: within 3 days, during day 4 to day 7, during day 8 to day 14 and after day 14. The numbers of cases for each group were 568, 496, 177 and 50 respectively. Data showed that from group 1 to 4, the prevalence rates of major symptoms on the first day of hospitalization were: (1) 9.7%, 16.5%, 23.1% and 24.0% for ""feeling chest pain"" (P < 0.001), (2) 7.4%, 13.7%, 19.2% and 22.0% for ""suffering from breathing obstruction"" (P < 0.001), (3) 32.8%, 44.8%, 59.9% and 48.0%, for ""coughing"" (P < 0.001) and (4) 14.1%, 22.4%, 27.1% and 18.0% for ""coughing up phlegm"" (P = 0.0002), respectively. The rates of high respiratory frequency (>or= 24 bits/min.) were 11.1%, 15.5%, 22.8% and 25.5% (P < 0.001). The rates of abnormal chest X-ray were 80.3%, 89.0%, 92.3% and 88.9%, respectively (P = 0.002). The average numbers of abnormal lung field (the lung were divided into 6 fields) were 1.7, 1.9, 2.5 and 2.6 (P < 0.001); The numbers of cases receiving continuous oxygen supply treatment were 33.6%, 50.0%, 53.7% and 74.0% (P < 0.001), and the numbers of cases receiving glucocorticosteroids treatment were 28.2%, 35.9%, 53.7% and 62.0% (P < 0.001), respectively. With cases having had chronic baseline diseases prior to SARS infection, the age-standardized fatality rates were 14.9%, 11.7%, 50.0% and 33.9% (P < 0.001), and the average courses of the disease were 30.3, 34.2, 42.9 and 47.5 days (P < 0.001), respectively. In cases without chronic baseline diseases, the age-standardized fatality rates were 5.3%, 9.8%, 9.2% and 8.3% (P = 0.101), and the average courses for each group were 32.4, 35.3, 40.9 and 47.6 days (P < 0.001), respectively. CONCLUSION Delayed hospitalization would cause the situation of SARS patient to deteriorate, losing the best chance for treatment and increase case fatality. In terms of control program on SARS, emphasize should be paid on decreasing the panic of patients to the disease so as to get early hospitalization.","Wu, Yang-feng; Zhang, Lin-feng; Xie, Gao-qiang; Chen, Bo-wen; Xiao, Feng; Wang, Yue-xiang; Han, De-min",Zhonghua liu xing bing xue za zhi = Zhonghua liuxingbingxue zazhi,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15231197/,424

With regard to the causes of community acquired pneumonias it is possible to distinguish those typical ones (caused by pneumococcus, legionella and other bacteria) and atypical ones (caused by mycoplasma, chlamydiae and others). Contrary to the atypical ones, typical pneumonias are characterized by sudden onset, high fever, chills, sometimes bloody expectoration and pains, as well as segmental or lobar changes and high leukocyte counts. Patients with tachycardia, diastolic blood pressure below 60 mm Hg and a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of more than 7 mmol/l, as well as those with chronic basic diseases and a severe course should be hospitalized, further also those, who do not improve after 2 or 3 days therapy, in all cases of suspected pneumonia, with smokers and with patients aged over 40 years, a thorax X-ray should be executed. Typical pneumonias should be treated with penicillin or macrolide antibiotics, atypical ones with macrolide antibiotics, pneumonias with severe course additionally with a second generation cephalosporin.

This report expands upon prior data and summarizes the annual prevalence (overall and by demographics) of LARC use from 2016 through 2020 among active component U.S. service women, compares LARC prevalence to the prevalence of short-acting reversible contraceptives (SARCs), and evaluates the probability of continued use of LARCs by type. LARC use increased from 21.9% to 23.9% from 2016 through 2019 while SARC use decreased from 28.3% to 24.9%. Both SARC and LARC use decreased in 2020 which may have been related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The prevalence of intrauterine devices (IUDs) was greater than implants, and IUDs also had a higher probability of continuation than implants. At 12 months, the continuation for IUDs was 81% compared to 73% for implants. At 24 months, the probabilities of continuation were 70% for IUDs and 54% for implants. Probabilities of continuation were similar across outsourced care and direct care settings. The increased use of LARCs along with their high frequency of continuation in U.S. service women may have a positive impact on overall health and readiness.","Lotridge, Jessica A; Stahlman, Shauna L; Patel, Deven M; Chauhan, Aparna V; Mcquistan, Alexis A; Wells, Natalie",MSMR,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34542257/,424

Similar evidence was found in two children who died from known causes and did not have a severe respiratory illness terminally. Although in some cases of cot death respiratory viruses may be responsible for a severe and rapidly overwhelming illness, the present results are compatible with an alternative hypothesis-namely, that minor respiratory illness may trigger sudden apnoea.","Scott, D J; Gardner, P S; McQuillin, J; Stanton, A N; Downham, M A",British medical journal,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/678779/,424

The course utilized online asynchronous coursework to deliver content that was completed on a self-guided timeline by students. With most of the veterinary medical curriculum delivered in a traditional classroom format, it is important to assess learning in this unique course format. There is also limited information on educational experiences in online shelter medicine coursework. This retrospective study aimed to evaluate student learning in the asynchronous online portion of the SSOI elective course using paired pre- and post-test scores from a multiple-choice type assessment. The study investigated how students' pre-test and post-test scores compared and whether time to completion of material influenced student assessment performance. Paired assessments from 400 students were analyzed, and a statistically significant increase was found in post-test scores compared to pre-test following completion of the online coursework (p < .001). There was no significant difference in the mean change in score from pre-test to post-test for students who completed the online course material in 30 days or less compared to those who completed it in greater than 30 days. This study's findings support online asynchronous learning as an effective option to teach veterinary students and can be considered in the development of veterinary coursework, including for curricular adjustments to increase online learning during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","Reinhard, Chelsea L; Powell, Lauren; Watson, Brittany",J Vet Med Educ,,424

In order to prevent its spread, many governments have enacted stringent measures. Supply chains around the world are facing major disruptions and difficulties adjusting to the new demands and needs of a locked down world. In this paper, we will address the relationship between supply chain operations and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Given current global shortages in essential goods such as medication, we explore the connection between said shortage and supply chain issues, such as the lack of supply chain transparency and resilience, as well as unsustainable just-in-time manufacturing. To mitigate the effects of these issues and protect supply chain operations, we propose some recommendations, such as nationalizing the medical supply chains, adopting a plus one diversification approach, and increasing safety stock. These recommendations are given to not only mitigate current consequences in relation to the ongoing crisis, but also to suggest measures that will provide firms the resiliency needed to weather similar potential shortages in the future.","Zhu, Guiyang; Chou, Mabel C.; Tsai, Christina W.",Sustainability,,424

212472,COVID-19 in LMICs: The Need to Place Stigma Front and Centre to Its Response,2020,"RATIONALE: Recently, patients with COVID-19 who showed persistently positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results despite resolved clinical symptoms have attracted a lot of attention. We report the case of a patient with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), who achieved clinical recovery but showed persistently positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test results until Day 92 after disease onset. PATIENT CONCERNS: The patient is a 50-year-old man with mild symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). DIAGNOSES: COVID-19 pneumonia. INTERVENTIONS: The patient was quarantined for 105 days. Of these, inpatient quarantine lasted for 75 days. When the nucleic acid test results were negative for 3 consecutive days, the patient was discharged at Day 75 after disease onset. During this period, multiple samples were collected from the patient's body surface, the surrounding environment, and physical surfaces, but none of these tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. These samples included those from anal swabs, hands, inner surface of mask, cell phone, bed rails, floor around the bed, and toilet bowl surface. However, nucleic acid retest results on Day 80 and Day 92 after disease onset were positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids. OUTCOMES: The patient continued with quarantine and observation at home. After the test results on Days 101 and 105 after disease onset were negative, quarantine was terminated at last. LESSONS: Per our knowledge, this is the longest known time that a patient has tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acids. No symptoms were observed during follow-up. During hospitalization, the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positivity was not observed in samples from the body surface and surrounding environment, and no verified transmission event occurred during the quarantine at home. After undergoing clinical recovery a minority of patients with COVID-19 have shown long-term positive results for the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid.

Further studies are required to analyze potential infectivity in such patients and determine whether more effective antiviral drugs or regimens to enable these patients to completely clear viral infection should be researched.","Wang, Junxue; Hang, Xiaofeng; Wei, Bo; Li, Dingchen; Chen, Fangyan; Liu, Wei; Yang, Chaojie; Miao, Xiaohui; Han, Li",Medicine (Baltimore),,424
212521,Pharmacotherapy virtual attachment during COVID-19 pandemic: Use of online experiential assessment in a Malaysian pharmacy school,2020,"Bats are known reservoirs of Nipah virus (NiV) and some filoviruses and also appear likely to harbor the evolutionary progenitors of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) While bats are considered a reservoir of deadly viruses, little is known about people&rsquo;s knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of bat conservation and ecology The current study aimed to assess community people&rsquo;s knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of bat ecology, myths, and the role of bats in transmitting NiV in Bangladesh Since 2001, NiV has been a continuous threat to public health with a mortality rate of approximately 70% in Bangladesh Over the years, many public health interventions have been implemented to raise awareness about bats and the spreading of NiV among the community peoples of Nipah outbreak areas (NOAs) and Nipah non-outbreak areas (NNOAs) We hypothesized that people from both areas might have similar knowledge of bat ecology and myths about bats but different knowledge regarding their role in the spreading of NiV Using a four-point Likert scale-based questionnaire, our analysis showed that most people lack adequate knowledge regarding the role of bats in maintaining the ecological balance and instead trust their beliefs in different myths about bats Factor score analysis showed that respondents&rsquo;gender (p = 0 01), the outbreak status of the area (p = 0 03), and their occupation (p = 0 04) were significant factors influencing their knowledge of bat ecology and myths A regression analysis showed that farmers had 0 34 times the odds of having correct or positive knowledge of bat ecology and myths than businesspersons (odds ratio (OR) = 0 34, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) = 0 15&ndash;0 78, p = 0 01) Regarding the spreading of NiV via bats, people had a lower level of knowledge In NOAs, age (p = 0 00), occupation (p = 0 00), and level of education (p = 0 00) were found to be factors contributing to the amount of knowledge regarding the transmission of NiV, whereas in NNOAs, the contributing factors were occupation (p = 0 00) and level of education (p = 0 01) Regression analysis revealed that respondents who were engaged in services (OR = 3 02, 95% CI = 1 07&ndash;8 54, p = 0 04) and who had completed primary education (OR = 3 06, 95% CI = 1 02&ndash;9 17, p &lt;0 05) were likely to have correct knowledge regarding the spreading of NiV Based on the study results, we recommend educational interventions for targeted groups in the community, highlighting the ecosystem services and conservation of bats so as to improve people&rsquo;s current knowledge and subsequent behavior regarding the role of bats in ecology and the spreading of NiV in Bangladesh","Hassan, Mohammad Mahmudul; Kalam, Md.

AIMS: Given that inflammasome products, like caspase-1, play a role in the pathophysiology of a number of co-morbid conditions, we investigated caspases across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease. MATERIALS & METHODS: We assessed transcriptional states of multiple caspases and using flow cytometry, the expression of active caspase-1 in blood cells from COVID-19 patients in acute and convalescent stages of disease. Non-COVID-19 subject presenting with various comorbid conditions served as controls. RESULTS: Single-cell RNA-seq data of immune cells from COVID-19 patients showed a distinct caspase expression pattern in T cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and eosinophils compared with controls. Caspase-1 was upregulated in CD4+ T-cells from hospitalized COVID-19 patients compared with unexposed controls. Post-COVID-19 patients with lingering symptoms (long-haulers) also showed upregulated caspase-1activity in CD4+ T-cells that ex vivo was attenuated with a select pan-caspase inhibitor. We observed elevated caspase-3/7levels in red blood cells from COVID-19 patients compared with controls that was reduced following caspase inhibition. DISCUSSION: Our preliminary results suggest an exuberant caspase response in COVID-19 that may facilitate immune-related pathological processes leading to severe outcomes. Further clinical correlations of caspase expression in different stages of COVID-19 will be needed. CONCLUSION: Pan-caspase inhibition could emerge as a therapeutic strategy to ameliorate or prevent severe COVID-19.","Plassmeyer, Matthew; Alpan, Oral; Corley, Michael J; Premeaux, Thomas A; Lillard, Kimberleigh; Coatney, Paige; Vaziri, Tina; Michalsky, Suzan; Pang, Alina P S; Bukhari, Zaheer; Yeung, Stephen T; Evering, Teresa H; Naughton, Gail; Latterich, Martin; Mudd, Philip; Spada, Alfred; Rindone, Nicole; Loizou, Denise; Ulrik Sønder, Søren; Ndhlovu, Lishomwa C; Gupta, Raavi",Allergy,,424

The existing surveys have mainly focused on deepfake video detection only. No attempt has been made to review approaches for detection and generation of both audio and video deepfakes. This paper provides a comprehensive review and detailed analysis of existing tools and machine learning (ML) based approaches for deepfake generation and the methodologies used to detect such manipulations for the detection and generation of both audio and video deepfakes. For each category of deepfake, we discuss information related to manipulation approaches, current public datasets, and key standards for the performance evaluation of deepfake detection techniques along with their results. Additionally, we also discuss open challenges and enumerate future directions to guide future researchers on issues that need to be considered to improve the domains of both the deepfake generation and detection.

Despite mortality rates surpassing 40%, key insights into COVID-19-induced ARDS pathology have not been fully elucidated and multiple unmet needs remain. This review focuses on the unmet need for effective therapies that target unchecked innate immunity-driven inflammation which drives unchecked vascular permeability, multiorgan dysfunction and ARDS mortality. Additional unmet needs including the lack of insights into factors predicting pathogenic hyperinflammatory viral host responses, limited approaches to address the vast disease heterogeneity in ARDS, and the absence of clinically-useful ARDS biomarkers. We review unmet needs persisting in COVID-19-induced ARDS in the context of the potential role for damage-associated molecular pattern proteins in lung and systemic hyperinflammatory host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection that ultimately drive multiorgan dysfunction and ARDS mortality. Insights into promising stratification-enhancing, biomarker-based strategies in COVID-19 and non-COVID ARDS may enable the design of successful clinical trials of promising therapies.","Bime, Christian; Casanova, Nancy G; Nikolich-Zugich, Janko; Knox, Kenneth S; Camp, Sara M; Garcia, Joe G N",Transl. res,,424

In addition to their regular duties, they undertake some additional tasks to evaluate each individual's body temperature and welcome them with a hand sanitizer. In this scenario, their situational awareness is hugely desirable to perform these activities for the entire campus's safety. This situational awareness of guards means their ability to observe, inspect, and make the right decisions. However, due to their fatigue and other secondary activities, such as cell phone use, they cannot perform their duties correctly. In this context, this paper presents a method for sending random alarms in real-time to the on-duty guards, who are executing their work at the campus gates, remotely monitoring the alertness throughout the day from the head security office. For alertness detection, the system uses a simple client-server model. The system is designed using NodeMCU Wi-Fi modules. The algorithm of the Client, server, and repeater has been developed. The prototype has been tested by placing it on the working individuals' desk inside the departmental lab inside the campus. The system records the response time of the working individuals. These data are further used to calculate their percentage of alertness. In addition, an alertness-rating/scoring method has been developed to improve their work performance. This system can be an economical solution to enable the awareness of on-duty guards.","Bej, Debabrata; Chakraborty, Shubhranil; Mahammad, Sekh Arif; Mal, Ashis Kumar",J Reliab Intell Environ,,424

Resident oncologists and their practices are equally affected. Objectives: The study examines resident oncologists' challenges, experiences and approaches in the delivery of care for oncological patients receiving palliative treatment and their relatives during the pandemic. Findings will support future pandemic preparedness for cancer treatment in outpatients. Materials and methods: Content analyses of 13 guideline-based telephone interviews with resident oncologists. Results: Solid local networks, staff and structural rearrangements and infection control within offices helped oncologists maintaining quality of care. Required treatments have been continued. The interrupted information flow towards patients' relatives and catching up on previously postponed primary, control or follow-up consultations have been reported as a challenge. Other issues have been linked to suspected SARS-CoV­2 infection in patients and staff. The lack of information, temporal inaccessibility of health care authorities and physicians' associations, and additional costs for infection control material caused further problems. Conclusions: Due to the firmly implemented infection control and the re-organisation of facilities and staff, oncologists have been able to maintain treatment and care for cancer patients and their relatives. Hygiene procedures proved to work well and might be re-activated. An increased use of digital applications for treatment monitoring might be considered. Furthermore, solutions to meet additional financial and personnel demands caused by infection control must be identified. The design of suitable concepts for the prevention of health-related hazards due to visiting bans for relatives and therapeutic staff such as physio- and occupational therapists is inevitable.","Weber, Jan P; Tielker, Jannik M; Kamandi, Nilab; Simon, Steffen T; Bausewein, Claudia; Stiel, Stephanie; Schneider, Nils",Onkologe (Berl),,424

In this study, we investigate whether platelet count could differentiate between COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease. Additionally, we evaluate if thrombocytopenia is associated with severe COVID-19. METHODS: An electronic search in Medline, Scopus and Web of Science was performed to identify studies reporting data on platelet count in COVID-19 patients. A meta-analysis was performed, with calculation of weighted mean difference (WMD) of platelet number in COVID-19 patients with or without severe disease and odds ratio (OR) of thrombocytopenia for severe form of COVID-19. RESULTS: Nine studies with 1779 COVID-19 patients, 399 (22.4%) with severe disease, were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled analysis revealed that platelet count was significantly lower in patients with more severe COVID-19 (WMD -31 × 109/L; 95% CI, from -35 to -29 × 109/L). A subgroup analysis comparing patients by survival, found an even lower platelet count was observed with mortality (WMD, -48 × 109/L; 95% CI, -57 to -39 × 109/L. In the four studies (n = 1427) which reported data on rate of thrombocytopenia, a low platelet count was associated with over fivefold enhanced risk of severe COVID-19 (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.8-14.6). CONCLUSIONS: Low platelet count is associated with increased risk of severe disease and mortality in patients with COVID-19, and thus should serve as clinical indicator of worsening illness during hospitalization.","Lippi, Giuseppe; Plebani, Mario; Henry, Brandon Michael",Clin Chim Acta,,424

The German government implemented a shutdown in Mar 2020, affecting outpatient and hospital care. The aim of the present article was to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 shutdown on patient volumes and surgical procedures of a Level I trauma center in Germany. METHODS: All emergency patients were recorded retrospectively during the shutdown and compared to a calendar-matched control period (CTRL). Total emergency patient contacts including trauma mechanisms, injury patterns and operation numbers were recorded including absolute numbers, incidence proportions and risk ratios. RESULTS: During the shutdown period, we observed a decrease of emergency patient cases (417) compared to CTRL (575), a decrease of elective cases (42 vs. 13) and of the total number of operations (397 vs. 325). Incidence proportions of emergency operations increased from 8.2 to 12.2% (shutdown) and elective surgical cases decreased (11.1 vs. 4.3%). As we observed a decrease for most trauma mechanisms and injury patterns, we found an increasing incidence proportion for severe open fractures. Household-related injuries were reported with an increasing incidence proportion from 26.8 to 47.5% (shutdown). We found an increasing tendency of trauma and injuries related to psychological disorders. CONCLUSION: This analysis shows a decrease of total patient numbers in an emergency department of a Level I trauma center and a decrease of the total number of operations during the shutdown period. Concurrently, we observed an increase of severe open fractures and emergency operations. Furthermore, trauma mechanism changed with less traffic, work and sports-related accidents.","Kreis, Carolin A; Ortmann, Birte; Freistuehler, Moritz; Hartensuer, René; Van Aken, Hugo; Raschke, Michael J; Schliemann, Benedikt",Eur J Trauma Emerg Surg,,424

Understanding how individuals respond to these new rules, particularly whether they are likely to follow or break them, is extremely important. Relational frame theory offers unique insights into rule-governed behavior, allowing researchers to develop functional-analytic interpretations of why a listener may understand a rule, have the required response established in their behavioral repertoire, and still choose not to follow the rule. Drawing from research on rule-following in accordance with relational frame theory and cognitive neuroscience, social psychology, and health literature, this paper presents reasons why a rule may be understood but not followed, identifying important considerations for implementing public health measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. Specifically, rule-givers should attend to their credibility, authority and ability to mediate consequences, rule plausibility, establishing adequate motivative augmental control, whether the behavior specified in the rule opposes habits, and whether the message incites counterpliance.","Stapleton, Alison",J.

222647,Tracking the Characteristics of Economic Growth Vulnerability to COVID-19: A Preliminary Analysis,2020,"Lung-secreted IgG and IgM antibodies are valuable biomarkers for monitoring the local immune response against respiratory infections. These biomarkers are found in lower airway secretions that need to be liquefied prior to analysis. Traditional methods for sample liquefaction rely on reducing disulfide bonds, which may damage the structure of the biomarkers and hamper their immunodetection. Here, we propose an alternative enzymatic method that uses O2 bubbles generated by endogenous catalase enzymes in order to liquefy respiratory samples. The proposed method is more efficient for liquefying medium- and high-viscosity samples and does not fragment the antibodies. This prevents damage to antigen recognition domains and recognition sites for secondary antibodies that can decrease the signal of immunodetection techniques. The suitability of the enzymatic method for detecting antibodies in respiratory samples is demonstrated by detecting anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM to viral N-protein with gold standard ELISA in bronchial aspirate specimens from a multicenter cohort of 44 COVID-19 patients. The enzymatic detection sharply increases the sensitivity toward IgG and IgM detection compared to the traditional approach based on liquefying samples with dithiothreitol. This improved performance could reveal new mechanisms of the early local immune response against respiratory infections that may have gone unnoticed with current sample treatment methods.","Clemente, Antonio; Alba-Patiño, Alejandra; Santopolo, Giulia; Rojo-Molinero, Estrella; Oliver, Antonio; Borges, Marcio; Aranda, María; Del Castillo, Alberto; de la Rica, Roberto",Anal Chem,,424

These differences have important practical implications for comparing and correcting perception and performance, and important theoretical implications for understanding the design principles underlying color coding. Color percepts within and between individuals often vary less than the variations in spectral sensitivity might predict. This stability is achieved by a variety of processes that compensate perception for the sensitivity limits of the eye and brain. Yet judgments of color between individuals can also vary widely, and in ways that are not readily explained by differences in sensitivity or the environment. These differences are uncorrelated across different color categories, and could reflect how these categories are learned or represented.","Emery, Kara J; Webster, Michael A",Curr Opin Behav Sci,,424

Data regarding patterns of use and effectiveness of self-referred, open-access online interventions are lacking. We evaluated an online-based treatment designed to address stress, depression, and conflict management, the Dartmouth PATH Program, in a freely available and self-guided format during the COVID-19 pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The primary aim is to determine users' levels of stress and depression, and the nature of problems and triggers they reported during the COVID-19 pandemic. A secondary objective is to assess the acceptability and usability of the PATH content and determine whether such a program would be useful as a stand-alone open-access resource. The final objective is understanding the high dropout rates associated with online behavioral programs by contrasting the use pattern and program efficacy of individuals who completed session one and did not return to the program with those who came back to complete more sessions. METHODS: Cumulative anonymous data from 562 individuals were analyzed. Stress triggers, stress responses, and reported problems were analyzed using qualitative analysis techniques. Scores on usability and acceptability questionnaires were evaluated using the sign test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. Mixed-effects linear modeling was used to evaluate changes in stress and depression over time. RESULTS: A total of 2484 users registered from April through October 2020, most of whom created an account without initiating a module. A total of 562 individuals started the program and were considered in the data analysis. The most common stress triggers individuals reported involved either conflicts with family or spouses and work or workload. The most common problems addressed in the mood module were worry, anxiousness, or stress and difficulty concentrating or procrastination. The attrition rate was high with 13% (21/156) completing the conflict module, 17% (50/289) completing session one of the mood module, and 14% (16/117) completing session one of the stress module. Usability and acceptability scores for the mood and stress modules were significantly better than average. In those who returned to complete sessions, symptoms of stress showed a significant improvement over time (P=.03), and there was a significant decrease in depressive symptoms over all time points (P=.01). Depression severity decreased on average by 20% (SD 35.2%; P=.60) between sessions one and two. CONCLUSIONS: Conflicts with others, worry, and difficulty concentrating were some of the most common problems people used the programs to address. Individuals who completed the modules indicated improvements in self-reported stress and depression symptoms. Users also found the modules to be effective and rated the program highly for usability and acceptability. Nevertheless, the attrition rate was very high, as has been found with other freely available online-based interventions.

223514,The solidarity map experience in face of inequality in times of pandemic,2020,"Digital communications and e-commerce reshape corporate processes and add new risks to business activities. The recent outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID 19) pandemic, has led to an increase in the demand for instant messaging and videoconferencing. There has been the need to maximize the availability of messaging, and mostly videoconference platforms. These platforms provide end-to-end communications services. Organizations have asked staff to work from home which necessitates work from home as well as meeting up with regular work schedule meetings which are carried out via these platforms mentioned. Communication Networks provide channels for such tasks to be carried out. These networks are used for the transmission for a wide range of valuable and confidential information. As a result, they draw the interest of persons who want to intercept or manipulate data or interrupt or damage the storage or communication of the networks. In this study a review of security as it pertains end-to-end connection is presented, we looked at a brief background of the issues which includes a description of security engineering with attendant examples, made our findings and observations. The paper ends with a brief in the form of a case study of a few ICT firms that provide end-to-end services. Such services fall into the category of instant messaging (IM), videoconferencing and remote management, showing how much they value end-to-end encryption and the impact it could have on their businesses. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Bameyi, O.

A case study of early childhood education and care teachers’ experiences surrounding education during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Survivors of COVID-19 are a vulnerable population, with complex needs because of lingering symptoms and complications across multiple organ systems. Those who required hospitalization or intensive care are also at risk for post-hospital syndrome and post-ICU syndromes, with attendant cognitive, psychological, and physical impairments, and high levels of health-care utilization. Effective ambulatory care for COVID-19 survivors requires coordination across multiple subspecialties, which can be burdensome if not well coordinated. With growing recognition of these needs, post-COVID-19 clinics are being created across the country. We describe the design and implementation of multidisciplinary post-COVID-19 clinics at two academic health systems, Johns Hopkins and the University of California-San Francisco. We highlight components of the model which should be replicated across sites, while acknowledging opportunities to tailor offerings to the local institutional context. Our goal is to provide a replicable framework for others to create these much-needed care delivery models for survivors of COVID-19.","Santhosh, Lekshmi; Block, Brian; Kim, Soo Yeon; Raju, Sarath; Shah, Rupal J; Thakur, Neeta; Brigham, Emily Pfeil; Parker, Ann Marie",Chest,,424

The current meta-analysis aims to provide additional (and updated) evidence related to the psychological impact among healthcare workers. The search strategy was developed by a medical librarian and bibliographical databases, including Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and Scopus were searched for studies examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological health of healthcare workers. Articles were screened by three reviewers. Heterogeneity among studies was assessed by I2 statistic. The random-effects model was utilized to obtain the pooled prevalence. A subgroup analysis by region, gender, quality of study, assessment methods, healthcare profession, and exposure was performed. Publication bias was assessed by Funnel plot and Egger linear regression test. Sixty-five studies met the inclusion criteria and the total sample constituted 79,437 participants. The pooled prevalence of anxiety, depression, stress, post-traumatic stress syndrome, insomnia, psychological distress, and burnout was 34.4%, 31.8%, 40.3%, 11.4%, 27.8%, 46.1%, and 37.4% respectively. The subgroup analysis indicated higher anxiety and depression prevalence among females, nurses, and frontline responders than males, doctors, and second-line healthcare workers.

224103,Crisis remote education at the maria grzegorzewska university during social isolation in the opinions of students,2020,"Background COVID-19 has impacted the psychological wellbeing of healthcare workers and has forced pharmacists to adapt their services. Objective To measure burnout and describe the work and psychosocial factors affecting pharmacists during COVID-19, and to compare males and females. Setting An online survey was distributed to a convenience sample of pharmacists practicing in any setting in Australia during April and June 2020. Method The survey collected demographic data, burnout scores using the validated Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), psychosocial and work-related variables using questions adapted from previous surveys. It was tested for readability by a group of pharmacists and academic clinicians before distribution via social media and professional organisations. Main outcome measure Burnout was calculated using mean MBI scores, descriptive statistics were used to report work and psychosocial variables and Pearson's chi-square compared males and females. Results Overall, 647 responses were analysed. Most participants were female n = 487 (75.7%) with hospital n = 269 (42.2%) and community n = 253 (39.9%) pharmacists well represented. Mean (SD) for emotional exhaustion (possible range 0-54) and depersonalisation (possible range 0-30) were 28.5 (13.39) and 7.98 (5.64), which were higher (increased burnout) than reported pre-COVID-19. Personal accomplishment (range 0-48, lower scores associated with burnout) mean (SD) 36.58 (7.56), was similar to previously reported. Males reported higher depersonalisation indicating more withdrawal and cynicism. Working overtime, medication supply and patient incivility were reported to affect work. Conclusion Pharmacists are experiencing burnout, with work and psychosocial factors affecting them during COVID-19. Knowledge of this and that males experience more depersonalisation is valuable to inform advocacy and interventions to support pharmacists.","Johnston, Karlee; O039,; Reilly, Claire L; Scholz, Brett; Georgousopoulou, Ekavi N; Mitchell, Imogen",Int. j. clin. pharm,,424

Here we document the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic among households, adults and children in low-income countries. To do so, we rely on longitudinal household survey data from Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria and Uganda, originating from pre-COVID-19 face-to-face household surveys plus phone surveys implemented during the pandemic. We estimate that 256 million individuals-77% of the population-live in households that have lost income during the pandemic. Attempts to cope with this loss are exacerbated by food insecurity and an inability to access medicine and staple foods. Finally, we find that student-teacher contact has dropped from a pre-COVID-19 rate of 96% to just 17% among households with school-aged children. These findings can inform decisions by governments and international organizations on measures to mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Josephson, Anna; Kilic, Talip; Michler, Jeffrey D",Nat Hum Behav,,424

The aim of this study was to analyze the application value of ZIC5 in the prognosis evaluation of LC. Materials and Methods: The mRNA and protein levels of ZIC5 in LC tissues and adjacent normal controls were detected by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot analysis, respectively. Chi-square test was performed to estimate the association between ZIC5 expression and clinical features. Furthermore, overall survival (OS) curves were plotted using Kaplan-Meier method with log rank test. The prognosis analysis was analyzed using Cox proportional hazards model. Results: Compared with that of noncancerous tissues, the expression of ZIC5 in LC tissues was significantly increased at both protein and mRNA levels (p < 0.001). Moreover, ZIC5 expression showed a positive correlation with differentiation (p = 0.001) and tumor size (p = 0.016). Survival analysis suggested that high expression of ZIC5 predicted shorter OS (log rank test, p = 0.007). ZIC5 might be an independent prognostic biomarker for LC (hazard ratio = 2.892; 95% confidence interval, 1.297-6.449; p = 0.009). Conclusions: ZIC5 expression is upregulated in LC, and it may be employed as a prognostic biomarker for patients with LC.","Dong, Caijun; Li, Xiangguo; Li, Kang; Zheng, Chao; Ying, Jianjian",,,424

Five compounds inhibited the helicase activity with submicromolar potencies (IC50, 0.73-1.65 µM) and ten compounds inhibited the enzyme with micromolar potencies (IC50, 19.6-502 µM). The molecular operating environment (MOE) was used to dock the identified inhibitors on the MERS-CoV helicase nucleotide binding. Strong inhibitors docked well in the nucleotide-binding site and established interactions with some of the essential residues. There was a reasonable correlation between the observed IC50 values and the MOE docking scores of the strong inhibitors (r 2 = 0.74), indicating the ability of the in silico docking model to predict the binding of strong inhibitors. In silico docking could be a useful complementary tool used with the FRET-based assay to predict new MERS-CoV helicase inhibitors. The identified inhibitors could potentially be used in the clinical development of new antiviral treatment for MERS-CoV and other coronavirus related diseases, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).","Mehyar, N; Mashhour, A; Islam, I; Gul, S; Adedeji, A O; Askar, A S; Boudjelal, M",SAR QSAR Environ Res,,424
227449,The impact of COVID-19 on the degree of dependence and structure of risk-return relationship: A quantile regression approach,2020,"Rationale & Objectives: Previously we reported a cohort of COVID19-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) patients with striking biochemical evidence of tissue breakdown in the absence of apparent rhabdomyolysis. Herein we sought to quantify the extent of tissue catabolism in similar patients. Study design: During acute peritoneal dialysis (PD) in COVID-AKI patients we measured urea Kt/V adequacy and calculated daily urea nitrogen generation rate while quantifying their daily protein intake. Setting and population: We did calculations in 8 COVID-AKI patients undergoing acute PD at the Mount Sinai Hospital in NYC. As a comparator we obtained urea kinetic parameters from our database of ambulatory patients on maintenance PD. Exposure or predictors: 8 COVID-AKI patients undergoing acute PD. Outcomes: Urea nitrogen generation rate in relation to daily protein intake. Analytical Approach: Urea nitrogen generation rate from urea kinetics was related to measured daily dietary protein intake in these patients and compared it to this relationship in ambulatory maintenance PD patients where both parameters were calculated from urea kinetics. Results: Urea nitrogen generation rate in AKI patients was 10.2 + 5g/day, which is >2 fold higher than stable outpatients on maintenance PD (4.7 + 3g/day), despite similar dietary protein intake (74.8 + 11g/day vs 67.2 + 29g/day, respectively). This strongly suggests endogenous protein breakdown, probably from muscle. Urea nitrogen generation rate in these AKI patients corresponds to 315g/day of ongoing muscle breakdown and cumulative 2.5kg muscle breakdown during the early course of AKI. Limitations: Small number of participants as well as assumptions in comparing Urea nitrogen generation rate with protein intake. Conclusions: In highly catabolic patients, an endogenous source of urea generation, such as muscle protein breakdown, seems to be the most likely explainable cause for our findings. This is the first study that we are aware of to quantify the degree of endogenous protein breakdown induced by COVID cytokine storm.","Uribarri, Jaime; El Shamy, Osama; Sharma, Shuchita; Winston, Jonathan",,,424

The cooperation between parents and educators, including through digital tools, plays an important role in this respect. The paper examines a) how often and of what type early childhood educators implemented digitally supported parental cooperation during the closure of day-care centres, b) which attitudes educators had towards general as well as digitally supported parental cooperation, and c) what role their qualifications, their attitudes and their perceived support through the centre played for their digital and non-digital parental cooperation during the closure of day-care centres. The study is based on a nationwide online survey of 3513 early childhood educators in day-care centres during corona closing time. The results show that educators' perceived importance of parental cooperation had a positive influence on whether or not educators had stayed in contact with the parents. Whether this contact occurs via digital media, in turn, depended on educators' attitudes towards digital media, the expected reaction of parents to this form of parental cooperation and the availability of technical support for implementing digital media in parental cooperation. The results are discussed with regard to the structural conditions of institutions and the professional skills of early childhood educators for a broad implementation of digital media in early childhood education practice.","Cohen, Franziska; Oppermann, Elisa; Anders, Yvonne",Z Erziehwiss,,424

Fifty percent of patients infected required hospitalization for treatment of disease. CONCLUSIONS: With this report of 14 patients who developed COVID-19 infection after completion of vaccination, we believe there is sufficient evidence to issue warnings that immunoincompetent populations should continue to practice strict COVID-19 precautions postvaccination. Transplant centers should reinforce that guidance given to the general population may not be applicable to the transplant population. A centralized transplant registry of fully vaccinated solid organ transplant patients who develop COVID-19 infections is vital.

The effectiveness of the preventive measures is greatly influenced by the public's knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards the disease. In this study, KAP values and some characteristic features of people recovered from COVID-19 were determined by conducting a questionnaire survey. Materials and Methods:&nbsp;The questionnaire survey was conducted between 1 and 10 January 2021 on people who recovered from COVID-19 in a total of 150 different locations in Turkey. The questionnaire consisted of 46 questions: 14 for determining demographic and some characteristic features of the participants, and 32 for determining their knowledge, attitudes, and practices. The data obtained were evaluated using descriptive statistics, chi-squared tests, t-tests, and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: It was determined that 63% of the participants had at least one chronic illness, 3.9% suffered from the disease twice, and 45.2% changed their smoking habits. The average knowledge score of the participants about COVID-19 was calculated as 10.25 (SD = 2.37; range 0-15). The participants were found to have a high level of knowledge about the symptoms and prevention methods in general, and positive changes in post-illness attitudes and behaviors. However, there was a great instability regarding the drugs and vaccines used in the treatment of COVID-19. Conclusions: This was the first study carried out in Turkey to determine knowledge, attitudes, practices, and some characteristic features of people who recovered from COVID-19. It was suggested that health authorities in the country need to develop more effective strategies and policies to find out permanent solutions in order to control and prevent the COVID-19 pandemic by taking into account the concerns of the public, particularly with regards to the drugs used in the treatment and vaccination.","Yakut, Seda; Karagülle, Burcu; Atçali, Tugçe; Öztürk, Yasin; Açik, Mehmet Nuri; Çetinkaya, Burhan",Medicina (Kaunas),,424

In the total cohort, male sex (hazard ratio [HR], 9.264; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.021-42.457; p = 0.004), C-reactive protein (CRP) (HR, 1.080 per mg/dL; 95% CI, 1.010-1.156; p = 0.025), and COVID-affected lung proportion (CALP) (HR, 1.067 per percentage; 95% CI, 1.033-1.101; p < 0.001) were significantly associated with CEFS. CRP (HR, 1.164 per mg/dL; 95% CI, 1.006-1.347; p = 0.041) was independently associated with CEFS in the mild pneumonia group (n = 54). Normally aerated lung proportion (NALP) (HR, 0.872 per percentage; 95% CI, 0.794-0.957; p = 0.004) and NALP volume (NALPV) (HR, 1.002 per mL; 95% CI, 1.000-1.004; p = 0.019) were associated with a lower risk of critical events in the severe pneumonia group (n = 28). CONCLUSION: CRP in the mild pneumonia group; NALP and NALPV in the severe pneumonia group; and sex, CRP, and CALP in the total cohort were independently associated with CEFS in patients with COVID-19.","Park, Byunggeon; Park, Jongmin; Lim, Jae Kwang; Shin, Kyung Min; Lee, Jaehee; Seo, Hyewon; Lee, Yong Hoon; Heo, Jun; Lee, Won Kee; Kim, Jin Young; Kim, Ki Beom; Moon, Sungjun; Choi, Sooyoung",Korean J Radiol,,424

233833,The impact of COVID-19: graduate students’ emotional and psychological experiences,2021,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted various aspects of daily living and has influenced the life of every individual in a unique way. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is associated with high morbidity and mortality; thus, timely treatment is crucial to prevent poor prognosis. Therefore, an immediate emergency department (ED) visit is required; however, no domestic studies have reported the effect of COVID-19 on ED visits by patients with AMI. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the changes in the pattern of ED visits by patients with AMI by comparing visits during the COVID-19 outbreak period to those during two control periods. METHODS: This nationwide, retrospective study used registry data of the National Emergency Department Information System. The 'outbreak period' was defined as the period between February 21, 2020 and April 1, 2020, while the 'control period' was defined as the same time period in the preceding two years (2018 and 2019). The primary outcome of our study was the number of patients admitted to the ED owing to AMI during the outbreak and control periods. Secondary outcomes were time from symptom onset to ED visit, length of ED stay, and 30-day mortality following admission. RESULTS: During the outbreak period, 401,378 patients visited the ED; this number was lower than that during the control periods (2018: 577,548; 2019: 598,514). The number of patients with AMI visiting the ED was lower during the outbreak period (2,221) than during 2018 (2,437) and 2019 (2,591). CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a reduction in ED visits by patients with AMI. We assume that this could likely be caused by misinterpretation of AMI symptoms as symptoms of respiratory infection, fear of contracting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, and restrictions in accessing emergency medical care owing to overburdened healthcare facilities. This study sheds light on the fact that healthcare and emergency medical staff members must work towards eliminating hurdles due to this pandemic for patients to receive timely emergency care, which in turn will help curb the growing burden of mortality.","Sung, Ho Kyung; Paik, Jin Hui; Lee, Yu Jin; Kang, Soo",J Korean Med Sci,,424

Older adults and patients with comorbidities and immunosuppressive conditions may experience severe signs and symptoms that can lead to death. This case series assesses the clinical course, imaging features, and outcomes for 12 patients with COVID-19 and a history of kidney transplantation. Patients were evaluated for symptoms, laboratory data, imaging findings, and outcomes from February 2020 to April 2020. Fever, cough, and dyspnea were the most common clinical symptoms, noted in 75% (nine/12), 75% (nine/12), and 41.7% (five/12) of the patients, respectively. Most of the patients had a normal white blood cell count, while 33.3% (four/12) had leukopenia and 8.3% (one/12) had leukocytosis. A combination of consolidation and ground glass opacity was the most predominant (75%) pattern of lung involvement on computed tomography (CT). Eight patients died of severe COVID-19 pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome and four were discharged. All recovered cases had a unilateral peripheral pattern of involvement limited to only one zone on initial chest CT. It seems that CT imaging has an important role in predicting COVID-19 outcomes for solid organ transplant recipients. Future studies with long-term follow up and more cases are needed to elucidate COVID-19 diagnosis, outcome, and management strategies for these patients.","Abrishami, Alireza; Samavat, Shiva; Behnam, Behdad; Arab-Ahmadi, Mehran; Nafar, Mohsen; Sanei Taheri, Morteza",Eur Urol,,424

INFs are known to shift the metabolism of tryptophan (TRP) away from its role as a precursor of serotonin. For some patients, reduction in TRP levels may either expose an underlying vulnerability to depression or trigger a de novo episode of depression. This Commentary discusses the pathway involved and recommends in-hospital augmentation with foods or supplements that increase TRP levels for COVID-19 patients treated with INFs. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may also be tried if the depressive symptomatology is not short-lived.","Shader, Richard I",Psychiatry Res,,424

No targeted treatment for COVID-19 infection has been identified so far, thus supportive treatment, invasive and non-invasive oxygen support, and corticosteroids remain a common therapy. High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), a non-invasive oxygen support method, has become a prominent treatment option for respiratory failure during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. HFNC reduces the anatomic dead space and increases positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), allowing higher concentrations and higher flow of oxygen. Some studies suggest positive effects of HFNC on mortality and avoidance of intubation. Spontaneous pneumothorax has been observed in patients suffering from SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Although the viral infection itself contributes to its development, higher PEEP generated by both HFNC and mechanical ventilation is another risk factor for increased alveoli damage and air-leak. Herein, we present three cases of patients with no previous history of lung diseases who were diagnosed with COVID-19 viral pneumonia. All of them were supported with HFNC, and all of them presented spontaneous pneumothorax.","Nalewajska, Magdalena; Feret, Wiktoria; Wojczynski, Lukasz; Witkiewicz, Wojciech; Wisniewska, Magda; Kotfis, Katarzyna",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,424

The open science study was co-designed by an international consortium of researchers to investigate how psychological responses differ across countries and cultures, and how this has impacted behaviour, coping and trust in government efforts to slow the spread of the virus. Starting in March 2020, COVIDiSTRESS leveraged the convenience of unpaid online recruitment to generate public data. The objective of the present analysis is to understand relationships between psychological responses in the early months of global coronavirus restrictions and help understand how different government measures succeed or fail in changing public behaviour. There were variations between and within countries. Although Western Europeans registered as more concerned over COVID-19, more stressed, and having slightly more trust in the governments' efforts, there was no clear geographical pattern in compliance with behavioural measures. Detailed plots illustrating between-countries differences are provided. Using both traditional and Bayesian analyses, we found that individuals who worried about getting sick worked harder to protect themselves and others. However, concern about the coronavirus itself did not account for all of the variances in experienced stress during the early months of COVID-19 restrictions. More alarmingly, such stress was associated with less compliance. Further, those most concerned over the coronavirus trusted in government measures primarily where policies were strict. While concern over a disease is a source of mental distress, other factors including strictness of protective measures, social support and personal lockdown conditions must also be taken into consideration to fully appreciate the psychological impact of COVID-19 and to understand why some people fail to follow behavioural guidelines intended to protect themselves and others from infection.

This makes a serious threat to the world in terms of public health. The present study aimed to compare the COVID-19 epidemic parameters in Turkey with the top ten countries that reported the highest number of confirmed cases worldwide on April 25, 2020. Plus, it might provide better insight into the efficacy of national interventions on the course of the disease by measuring the case-fatality rate. METHODS: A detailed search of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering official websites, and announcements were conducted between January 22 and April 25, 2020. COVID-19 related datasets for the distribution of the infection on each reported day were obtained. RESULTS: Although the growth rate sharply increased by more than 1.2% in the late January 2020, the cumulative number of cases remained below 1,500 around the world. The epidemic growth curve in Turkey was very similar to the US and Italy during the period. The case-fatality rate in Turkey was 2.51%, which below the countries with the most cases, except Russia, and the recovery-death ratio appeared to be at a moderate level among these countries. CONCLUSIONS: Since there are no standard treatments for the disease, it is important to avoid infection or further spreading. Decision-makers should adopt a series of measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic, using national surveillance systems.","Durmus, Veli",Vacunas (Madrid),,424

MethodsObservational studies reporting at least 30 cases of COVID-19 describing disease severity or mortality were included. Meta-data of demographics, clinical symptoms, vital signs, comorbidities, and 14 clinical laboratory biomarkers on initial hospital presentation were extracted. Taking the outcome group as the analysis unit, meta-regression analysis with the generalized estimating equations (GEE) method for clustered data was performed sequentially. The unadjusted effect of each potential predictor of the three binary outcome variables (i.e., severe vs. non-severe, critically severe vs. non-critically severe, and dead vs. alive) was examined one by one by fitting three series of simple GEE logistic regression models due to missing data. The worst one was dropped one at a time. Then, a final multiple GEE logistic regression model for each of the three outcome variables was obtained. FindingsMeta-data was extracted from 76 articles, reporting a total of 26,627 cases of COVID-19. Patients were recruited across 16 countries. The number of studies (patients) included in the final models of the analysis for severity, critical severity, and mortality was 38 studies (9,764 patients), 21 studies (4,792 patients), and 24 studies (14,825 patients), respectively. After adjusting for the effect of age, lymphocyte count mean or median [≤] 1.03 (estimated hazard ratio [HR] = 46.2594, p < 0.0001), smaller lymphocyte count mean or median (HR < 0.0001, p = 0.0028), and lymphocyte count mean or median [≤] 0.8714 (HR = 17.3756, p = 0.0079) were the strongest predictor of severity, critical severity, and mortality, respectively.

243766,A Wake-Up Call in Our Upside-Down World: Three Starting-Points for Advancing Health Rights and Social Justice in a Post-Pandemic Future,2020,"A central problem in the COVID-19 pandemic is that there is not enough testing to prevent infectious spread of SARS-CoV-2, causing surges and lockdowns with human and economic toll. Molecular tests that detect viral RNAs or antigens will be unable to rise to this challenge unless testing capacity increases by at least an order of magnitude while decreasing turnaround times. Here, we evaluate an alternative strategy based on the monitoring of olfactory dysfunction, a symptom identified in 76-83% of SARS-CoV-2 infections-including those with no other symptoms-when a standardized olfaction test is used. We model how screening for olfactory dysfunction, with reflexive molecular tests, could be beneficial in reducing community spread of SARS-CoV-2 by varying testing frequency and the prevalence, duration, and onset time of olfactory dysfunction. We find that monitoring olfactory dysfunction could reduce spread via regular screening, and could reduce risk when used at point-of-entry for single-day events.

Here, we performed high-dimensional flow cytometry-analysis focusing on mononuclear phagocyte (MNP) lineages in SARS-CoV-2-infected patients with moderate and severe COVID-19. We provide a deep and comprehensive map of the MNP landscape in COVID-19. A redistribution of monocyte subsets toward intermediate monocytes and a general decrease in circulating DCs was observed in response to infection. Severe disease coincided with the appearance of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cell-like cells and a higher frequency of pre-DC2. Furthermore, phenotypic alterations in MNPs, and their late precursors, were cell-lineage-specific and associated either with the general response against SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 severity. This included an interferon-imprint in DC1s observed in all patients and a decreased expression of the coinhibitory molecule CD200R in pre-DCs, DC2s, and DC3 subsets of severely sick patients. Finally, unsupervised analysis revealed that the MNP profile, alone, pointed to a cluster of COVID-19 nonsurvivors. This study provides a reference for the MNP response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and unravels mononuclear phagocyte dysregulations associated with severe COVID-19.","Kvedaraite, Egle; Hertwig, Laura; Sinha, Indranil; Ponzetta, Andrea; Hed Myrberg, Ida; Lourda, Magda; Dzidic, Majda; Akber, Mira; Klingström, Jonas; Folkesson, Elin; Muvva, Jagadeeswara Rao; Chen, Puran; Gredmark-Russ, Sara; Brighenti, Susanna; Norrby-Teglund, Anna; Eriksson, Lars I; Rooyackers, Olav; Aleman, Soo; Strålin, Kristoffer; Ljunggren, Hans-Gustaf; Ginhoux, Florent; Björkström, Niklas K; Henter, Jan-Inge; Svensson, Mattias",Proc.

However, most of the classical models fail to account for certain features of this disease and others like it, such as the ability of exposed individuals to recover without becoming infectious, or the possibility that asymptomatic individuals can indeed transmit the disease but at a lesser rate than the symptomatic. Furthermore, the rise of new disease variants and the imperfection of vaccines suggest that concept of endemic equilibrium is perhaps more pertinent than that of herd immunity. Here we propose a new compartmental epidemiological model and study its equilibria, characterizing the stability of both the endemic and disease-free equilibria in terms of the basic reproductive number. Moreover, we introduce a second compartmental model, generalizing our first, which accounts for vaccinated individuals, and begin an analysis of its equilibria.","Balisacan, Jonas; Chyba, Monique; Shanbrom, Corey",,,424

A spray disinfection technology (chamber) was developed, and its efficacy in instant decontamination of previously contaminated surfaces was evaluated in two exposure times. Seven test microorganisms were prepared and inoculated on the surface of seven types of PPE (respirator mask, face shield, shoe, glove, cap, safety glasses and lab coat). The tests were performed on previously contaminated PPE using a manikin with a motion device for exposure to the chamber with biocidal agent (sodium hypochlorite) for 10 and 30s. In 96.93% of the experimental conditions analyzed, the percentage reduction was >99% (the number of viable cells found on the surface ranged from 4.3x106 to <10 CFU/mL). The samples of E. faecalis collected from the glove showed the lowest percentages reduction, with 86.000 and 86.500% for exposure times of 10 and 30 s, respectively. The log10 reduction values varied between 0.85 log10 (E. faecalis at 30 s in glove surface) and 9.69 log10 (E. coli at 10 and 30 s in lab coat surface). In general, E. coli, S. aureus, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, C. albicans and C. parapsilosis showed susceptibility to the biocidal agent under the tested conditions, with >99% reduction after 10 and 30s, while E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa showed a lower susceptibility. The 30s exposure time was more effective for the inactivation of the tested microorganisms. The results show that the spray disinfection technology has the potential for instant decontamination of PPE, which can contribute to an additional barrier for infection control of healthcare workers in the hospital environment.","Brêda Mascarenhas, Luís Alberto; Machado, Bruna Aparecida Souza; Rodrigues, Leticia de Alencar Pereira; Saraiva Hodel, Katharine Valéria; Bandeira Santos, Alex Álisson; Freitas Neves, Paulo Roberto; da Silva Andrade, Leone Peter Correia; Soares, Milena Botelho; de Andrade, Jailson Bittencourt; Badaró, Roberto",PLoS One,,424

We obtained the number of cases and deaths due to SARS-CoV-2, international tourism, population age, universal health coverage, regional factors, the SARS-CoV-2 testing rate, and population density of a country. A total of 154 countries were included in this study. There were high incidence rates and mortality risks in the countries that had an average ambient temperature between 0 and 10 degreeC. The adjusted incidence rate for temperatures between 0 and 10 degreeC was 2.91 (95% CI 2.87-2.95). We randomly divided the data into a training set (80% of data) for model derivation and a test set (20% of data) for validation. Using a random forest statistical model, the model had high accuracy for predicting the high epidemic status of a country (ROC = 95.5%, 95% CI 87.9-100.0%) in the test set. Population age, temperature, and international tourism were the most important factors affecting the risk of SARS-CoV-2 in a country.

However, the mechanism of tissue tropism of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. Here, recombinant receptor-binding subdomain 1 of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 (RBD-SD1) was used as a probe to investigate the potential tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in thirty-three types of normal human tissues. RBD-SD1 probe was observed to interact with cells in reported SARS-CoV-2 infected organs. Interestingly, the RBD-SD1 probe strongly interacted with bone marrow cells in an angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-independent manner. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 induced the ACE2 mRNA expression in human primary bone marrow cells, suggesting human bone marrow cells may be sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, human bone marrow cells could be strongly infected by SARS-CoV-2, which may play an important role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19.

Domestic tourism and exports of agricultural and anti-COVID-19 medical products take priority over the other sectors in this postpandemic economic recovery. Importantly, the country needs to stay vigilant on the fight against the disease to prevent a possibility of another outbreak.","Nguyen, Trang H D",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,,424

Here, we present a new tool to investigate this interaction in situ and without additional labeling of the proteins and/or nanoparticles. By combining nonresonant second-harmonic light scattering with a modified Langmuir model, we show that it is possible to gain insight into the adsorption behavior of blood proteins, namely fibrinogen, human serum albumin, and transferrin, onto negatively charged polystyrene nanoparticles. The modified Langmuir model gives us access to the maximum amount of adsorbed protein, the apparent binding constant, and Gibbs free energy. Furthermore, we employ the method to investigate the influence of the nanoparticle size on the adsorption of human serum albumin and find that the amount of adsorbed protein increases more than the surface area per nanoparticle for larger diameters.","Bernhard, Christoph; van Zadel, Marc-Jan; Bunn, Alexander; Bonn, Mischa; Gonella, Grazia",J. phys. chem.

261518,Does personality predict responses to the COVID-19 crisis? Evidence from a prospective large-scale study,2021,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has substantially challenged healthcare systems worldwide. By investigating population characteristics and prescribing profiles, it is possible to generate hypotheses about the associations between specific drug-utilisation profiles and susceptibility to COVID-19 infection. A retrospective drug-utilisation study was carried out using routinely collected information from a healthcare database in Campania (Southern Italy). We aimed to discover the prevalence of drug utilisation (monotherapy and polytherapy) in COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 patients in Campania (~ 6 million inhabitants). The study cohort comprised 1532 individuals who tested positive for COVID-19. Drugs were grouped according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification system. We noted higher prevalence rates of the use of drugs in the ATC categories C01, B01 and M04, which was probably linked to related comorbidities (i.e., cardiovascular and metabolic). Nevertheless, the prevalence of the use of drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin system, such as antihypertensive drugs, was not higher in COVID-19 patients than in non-COVID-19 patients after adjustments for age and sex. These results highlight the need for further case-control studies to define the effects of medications and comorbidities on susceptibility to and associated mortality from COVID-19.","Orlando, Valentina; Coscioni, Enrico; Guarino, Ilaria; Mucherino, Sara; Perrella, Alessandro; Trama, Ugo; Limongelli, Giuseppe; Menditto, Enrica",Sci Rep,,424
261860,Covid-19 Pandemic and Higher Education in Tourism in the State of Rio De Janeiro (Brazil): Preliminary Research Notes,2020,"This paper establishes the determinants of the export durability of agriculture products in Zambia with specific attention to maize, sugar, cotton, and tobacco between 1996 and 2019. We find that approximately 39% of Zambia’s agricultural products were exported beyond the first year of trading and less than 10% lasted up to 6 years of trading. The mean and median duration of exporting agricultural products in Zambia was 1.7 years and 1 year, respectively. Among the products, maize had the highest export duration after the first year of trading, followed by sugar, tobacco, and cotton. Results of the discrete-time logit and probit models with random effects revealed that the duration of total agricultural products was significantly impacted by common colony, contiguity, partner’s gross domestic product (GDP), Zambia’s GDP, initial exports, and total exports. Of these factors, colonial history and Zambia’s GDP reduced export duration, while contiguity, partner’s GDP, initial exports, and total exports increased the durability of exports in Zambia. The effect of Zambia’s GDP was uniform across all individual agricultural products. Total exports also significantly impacted all other agriculture products in a similar manner except for maize. Export durability for cotton was significantly impacted by the Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs), while the export durability of tobacco was significantly impacted by distance, contiguity, and partner’s GDP. To increase the duration of agriculture exports, we propose the exporting of finished agriculture products (and not just raw materials), which have a higher market value and duration probability. Farmers also need support with export subsidies, increased foreign market access (especially to economies with higher buying power), and negotiated favorable trade terms in the region and around the globe.","Phiri, Joseph Malec Karel Majune Socrates Kraido Seth Nana Kwame Appiah-Kubi Gebeltová Zdeňka Kotásková Sylvie Kobzev Maitah Mansoor Maitah Kamil Naluwooza Patricia",Agriculture,,424
262833,Post-COVID-19 challenges in the indian IT industry,2020,"BACKGROUND: The corona pandemic poses enormous financial challenges for hospitals. Using the example of a clinic for orthopaedics and trauma surgery, the performance development of the first 5 weeks in comparison to last year and an evaluation of the compensation measures laid down by law will be evaluated. METHODOLOGY: Based on the performance figures, a comparison is made between the period 16.03 to 17.04.2019 and the same period in 2020. Changes in the number of cases, case mix, case-mix index and day-mix index, as well as the occupancy days are recorded. The monetary measures from the COVID-19 Hospital Relief Act are applied to these changes, and the adequacy is evaluated. RESULTS: Compared to last year, there was a decrease in inpatient admissions of nâ¯= 307 patients in the observation period. As a result, there was a decrease of 595 points in case mix and 2320 days of occupancy. This results in a decrease in revenue of approximately EUR 1.9 million. The flat rate for empty beds represents the largest monetary compensation for the loss of revenue. It amounts to approximately EUR 1.3 million. Taking into account further support and an adjustment for variable costs, a deficit of EUR 382,069 remains for 5 weeks. DISCUSSION: The measures taken by the Government are an important pillar for the economic security of German hospitals. The lack of differentiation of measures by specialty leads to insufficient compensation for orthopaedics and trauma surgery.","von Dercks, Nikolaus; Körner, Christian; Heyde, Christoph-E; Theopold, Jan",Orthopade,,424

This pandemic has had a significant impact on patients with chronic diseases. Among patients with demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS) or Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD), concerns remain about the potential impact of COVID-19 on these patients given their treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies. In this study, we review the existing literature investigating the impact of disease-modifying therapies(DMT) on COVID-19 risks in this group of patients. METHOD: For this systematic review, we searched PubMed from January 1, 2020, to December 3, 2020. The following keywords were used: ""COVID-19"" AND ""Multiple Sclerosis"" OR ""Neuromyelitis Optica."" Articles evaluating COVID-19 in patients with demyelinating diseases of CNS were included. This study evaluates the different aspects of the DMTs in these patients during the COVID-19 era. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: A total of 262 articles were found. After eliminating duplicates and unrelated research papers, a total of 84 articles met the final inclusion criteria in our study. Overall, the experiences of 2493 MS patients and 37 NMOSD patients with COVID-19 were included in this review. Among them, 46(1.8%) MS patients died(the global death-to-case ratio of Covid-19 was reported about 2.1%). Among DMTs, Rituximab had the highest mortality rate (4%). Despite controversies, especially concerning anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapies, a relation between DMT-use and COVID-19 disease- course was not found in many studies. This observation reinforces the recommendation of not stopping current DMTs. Other variables such as age, higher expanded disability status scale (EDSS) scores, cardiac comorbidities, and obesity were independent risk factors for severe COVID-19. Despite the risks of infection, most patients were willing to continue their DMT during the pandemic because of more significant concern about the risk of relapse or worsening MS symptoms. After the infection, an immune response's attenuation was seen in the patients on Fingolimod and anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies. This may be a critical finding in future vaccinations.","Sharifian-Dorche, Maryam; Sahraian, Mohammad Ali; Fadda, Giulia; Osherov, Michael; Sharifian-Dorche, Amirhossein; Karaminia, Maryam; Saveriano, Alexander William; La Piana, Roberta; Antel, Jack P; Giacomini, Paul Steven",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,424

Among children aged &#8804;10 years, ED visits declined by 72% compared with prepandemic levels (1). To assess the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on EDs, CDC examined trends in visits since December 30, 2018, and compared the numbers and types of ED visits by patient demographic and geographic factors during a COVID-19 pandemic period (December 20, 2020-January 16, 2021) with a prepandemic period 1 year earlier (December 15, 2019-January 11, 2020). After an initial decline during March-April 2020 (1), ED visits increased through July 2020, but at levels below those during the previous year, until December 2020-January 2021 when visits again fell to 25% of prepandemic levels. During this time, among patients aged 0-4, 5-11, 12-17, and &#8805;18 years, ED visits were lower by 66%, 63%, 38%, and 17%, respectively, compared with ED visits for each age group during the same period before the pandemic. Differences were also observed by region and reasons for ED visits during December 2020-January 2021; more visits during this period were for infectious diseases or mental and behavioral health-related concerns and fewer visits were for gastrointestinal and upper-respiratory-related illnesses compared with ED visits during December 2019-January 2020. Although the numbers of ED visits associated with socioeconomic factors and mental or behavioral health conditions are low, the increased visits by both adults and children for these concerns suggest that health care providers should maintain heightened vigilance in screening for factors that might warrant further treatment, guidance, or intervention during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Adjemian, Jennifer; Hartnett, Kathleen P; Kite-Powell, Aaron; DeVies, Jourdan; Azondekon, Roseric; Radhakrishnan, Lakshmi; van Santen, Katharina L; Rodgers, Loren",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,,424

267139,Addressing the Needs of Migrant Workers in ICUs in Singapore,2020,"Nursing home workers have been exposed to great physical and mental burdens during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although this has generated high levels of exhaustion, it may also have contributed to feelings of professional satisfaction. The objective of this study was to explore the levels of satisfaction among nursing home workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the role of job demands, resources and emotional experiences in explaining their levels of satisfaction. This cross-sectional study was conducted in Spain between March and May 2020. Three hundred and thirty-five nursing home workers participated. A quantitative analysis was conducted, as was a content analysis of the responses to an open-ended question about the respondents' perceptions of job demands and resources during the crisis. The results showed that workers had very high levels of satisfaction. Social pressure from work, contact with death and suffering, and emotional exhaustion were negatively associated with satisfaction. Moreover, under conditions of extensive contact with suffering people and great fear of contagion, social support at work was shown to promote professional satisfaction. In conclusion, nursing home workers in Spain experienced high rates of satisfaction during the COVID-19 crisis despite the high job demands, lack of job resources, fear of contagion and exhaustion. The main practical implication of this study is the importance of ensuring optimal working conditions in the nursing home sector in order to guarantee professional satisfaction, prevent burnout, reduce turnover and promote post-crisis resilience.","Blanco-Donoso, Luis Manuel; Moreno-Jiménez, Jennifer; Gallego-Alberto, Laura; Amutio, Alberto; Moreno-Jiménez, Bernardo; Garrosa, Eva",Heal. soc. care community,,424

These manifest as infarcts and decidual vasculopathy as well as thrombi in the fetal circulation and avascular villi. In some cases, there is also an inflammatory reaction with villitis, intervillositis, and fetal vasculitis. In addition, it has been shown that SARS-CoV­2 can directly infect the placenta, so vertical transmission is possible.There is no COVID-19 specific pattern of placental alterations, although the detection of fetal thrombovasculitis, villitis, and intervillositis as well as fetal and maternal malperfusion could be best interpreted as the signature of SARS-CoV­2 infection - considering the known pathophysiology of COVID-19 regarding other organs (inflammatory reaction and [micro]angiopathy).

A longitudinal comparison is then performed by upscaling the traced contacts with the transmission computed from a mean-field compartmental model for the entire city. Our results show that the effective reproduction numbers inside the buses, $Re^{bus}$, and in the city, $Re^{city}$, followed a compatible behavior during the first wave of the local outbreak. Moreover, by distinguishing the close contacts of healthcare workers in the buses, we discovered that their transmission, $Re^{health}$, during the same period, was systematically higher than $Re^{bus}$.

270419,"Our education, our concerns: The impact on medical student education of COVID-19",2020,"Retiform purpura has been described as a relatively frequent cutaneous finding in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The etiology is hypothesized to be related to thrombotic vasculopathy based on lesional biopsy specimen findings, but the pathogenesis of the vasculopathy is not completely understood. Here, we present a case of a retiform purpuric patch on the sacrum/buttocks in a hospitalized patient prior to subsequent diagnosis of COVID-19 and an eventual fatal disease course. Two lesional biopsy specimens at different time points in the disease course revealed thrombotic vasculopathy, despite therapeutic anticoagulation. Detailed histopathologic evaluation using immunohistochemical markers suggest the etiology of the vasculopathy involves both persistent complement activation and platelet aggregation, which possibly promote ongoing thrombus formation. This case highlights that sacral/buttock retiform purpuric patches may be a presenting sign of infection with SARS-CoV-2 virus and may represent an ominous sign supporting a future severe disease course. In addition, biopsy specimen findings at separate time points demonstrate that cutaneous vasculopathy may persist despite adequate systemic anticoagulation, possibly due to the combination of persistent complement and platelet activation. Finally, occlusive thrombi in sacral/buttock retiform purpuric patches may contribute to future ulceration and significant cutaneous morbidity in patients who survive COVID-19.","McBride, Jeffrey D; Narang, Jatin; Simonds, Robert; Agrawal, Shruti; Rodriguez, E Rene; Tan, Carmela D; Baldwin, William M; Dvorina, Nina; Krywanczyk, Alison R; Fernandez, Anthony P",J. cutan. pathol,,424

Some commercial lux meters do not have data storage and cannot connect to the internet. Therefore, this project developed a prototype of a lux meter with additional features such as data logger and IoT. The prototype is using NodeMCU as its controller because it is cheap and easy to use. Besides, the sensor used for this prototype is BH1750 light sensor. It has a wide range sensor, and it could detect up to 65535lx value. Then, the data obtained also can be stored and saved in the Secure Digital (SD) card. These features will allow the user to secure the data and use it in the future. For IoT, there is a built-in WiFI module which is ESP8266 where it connects the prototype to the application in a smartphone which is the Blynk application. In the application, it will show the reading of the lux from the prototype, and there is a graph analysis of the lux measurement. Apart from measuring the lux, this prototype is also suitable for monitoring applications as the measurement can be monitored from a smartphone.

273714,The health case for urgent action on climate change,2020,"During high-speed running, lower limb vertical velocity at touchdown has been cited as a critical factor needed to generate large vertical forces. Additionally, greater leg angular velocity has also been correlated with increased running speeds. However, the association between these factors has not been comprehensively investigated across faster running speeds. Therefore, this investigation aimed to evaluate the relationship between running speed, thigh angular motion, and vertical force determinants. It was hypothesized that thigh angular velocity would demonstrate a positive linear relationship with both running speed and lower limb vertical velocity at touchdown. A total of 40 subjects (20 males, 20 females) from various athletic backgrounds volunteered and completed 40 m running trials across a range of sub-maximal and maximal running speeds during one test session. Linear and angular kinematic data were collected from 31-39 m. The results supported the hypotheses, as across all subjects and trials (range of speeds: 3.1-10.0 m s-1), measures of thigh angular velocity demonstrated a strong positive linear correlation to speed (all R 2 >0.70, p<0.0001) and lower limb vertical velocity at touchdown (all R 2 =0.75, p<0.0001). These findings suggest thigh angular velocity is strongly related to running speed and lower limb impact kinematics associated with vertical force application.","Clark, Kenneth P; Meng, Christopher R; Stearne, David J",,,424

It was found that a binary and tertiary mixture of urea, thiourea, and sodium hydroxide could potentially fulfill this purpose. Experiments were carried out under different treatment time, temperature, and concentration of each component in the mixture. Dye properties of treated dyed samples after chemical modification in the form of K/S values were calculated. The changes in the samples' characteristics were evaluated by ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, microscopic examination, mechanical and pilling properties. The results indicated that a proper concentration of all three chemicals could enhance the dyeing properties of the substrate by which the NaOH concentration decreased from 300 to 160â¯g/lit.

To address this question, we develop a model with three policy instruments: testing frequency, lockdown intensity, and a subsidy for home delivery of food First, we consider the case where the testing frequency is adjusted so as to keep the pandemic's reproduction rate fixed In this case, the value of the subsidy for home delivery is to allow for a reduction in the testing rate without affecting the reproduction number This substitution is plausible when the testing rate is chosen optimally Using illustrative calibrations for the US, we find in this case that the optimal ad valorem subsidy for home delivery of food is between 1 7% and 3 4% However, it might be more likely that the testing rate continues to be chosen at a suboptimal level In this case, reducing the reproduction rate of COVID-19 via subsidies for home delivery could cause a reduction in the expected lockdown intensity Even if only 10% of the reduction in the reproduction rate is offset via reduced lockdown intensity, an ad valorem subsidy of between 5 4% and 10 8% will be warranted on these grounds alone","Stern, Lennart Gray Richard",,,424

The horizontal and vertical components of eye positions acquired by goal-directed saccades are determined by the object's location. However, the eccentric eye positions also involve a torsional component, which according to Donder's law is fully determined by the two-dimensional (2D) eye position acquired. According to von Helmholtz, knowledge of the amount of torsion provided by Listing's law, an extension of Donder's law, alleviates the perceptual interpretation of the image tilt that changes with 2D eye position, a view supported by psychophysical experiments he pioneered. We address the question of where and how Listing's law is implemented in the visual system and we show that neurons in monkey area V1 use knowledge of eye torsion to compensate the image tilt associated with specific eye positions as set by Listing's law.","Khazali, Mohammad Farhan; Ramezanpour, Hamidreza; Thier, Peter",Proc.

278030,Public Health Law and Science in the Community Mitigation Strategy for Covid-19,2020,"OBJECTIVES: In the context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, patients may have been dissuaded from seeking consultation, thus exposing themselves to a risk of loss of chance. This guide aims to define how teleconsultation can assist in assessing vertiginous adults or children, and to gather the information needed to provide quick medical care. METHODS: These recommendations rely on the authors' experience as well as on literature. A survey on otoneurologic approach via telemedicine has been conducted based on a literature search until March 2020. RESULTS: The first clinical assessment of the vertiginous patient via teleconsultation can only be successful if the following conditions are met: initial contact to verify the feasibility of the assessment at a distance, the presence of a caregiver in order to assist the patient, the possibility of making video recordings. Medical history via telemedicine, as in a face-to-face assessment, allows to assess the characteristics, duration, frequency, and potential triggering factors of the vertigo, in both children and adults. During teleconsultation, the following tests can be carried out: oculomotricity evaluation, assessment of balance, simple neurological tests, checking for positional vertigo/nystagmus and, eventually to perform canalith-repositioning procedures. In children, the following should be searched for: history of hearing or visual impairment, a context of fever or trauma, otorrhea, signs of meningeal irritation. CONCLUSION: The neurotologic telemedicine relies on the accuracy of the clinical assessment, which is based on history taking and a few simple tests, encouraging the development of a decision-making algorithm adapted for teleconsultation. However, the latter has its limitations during an emergency examination of a new patient presenting vertigo, and, at least in some cases, cannot replace a face-to-face consultation. Teleconsultation is often adapted for follow-up consultations of previously selected vertiginous patients during face-to-face assessment.","Bertholon, P; Thai-Van, H; Bouccara, D; Esteve-Fraysse, M-J; Wiener-Vacher, S R; Ionescu, E",Eur. ann. otorhinolaryngol. head neck dis,,424

To reduce transmission, a 'lockdown' was introduced in Ireland between March-May 2020. The aim of this study is to capture the experiences of Consultant Psychiatrists during lockdown and their perception of it's impact on Mental Health Services. METHODS: A questionnaire designed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists was adapted and circulated to Consultant members of the College of Psychiatrists following the easing of restrictions. The questionnaire assessed the perceived impact on referral rates, mental health act provision, availability of Information Technology (IT), consultant well-being and availability of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). Thematic analysis was employed to analyse free-text sections. RESULTS: Response rate was 32% (N=197/623). Consultants reported an initial decrease/significant decrease in referrals in the first month of lockdown (68%, N=95/140) followed by an increase/significant increase in the second month for both new (83%, N=100/137) and previously attending patients (65%, N=88/136). Social isolation and reduced face-to-face mental health supports were among the main reasons identified. The needs of children and older adults were highlighted. Most consultants (76%, N=98/129) felt their working day was affected and their well-being reduced (52%, N=61/119). The majority felt IT equipment availability was inadequate (67%, N=88/132). Main themes identified from free-text sections were service management, relationship between patients and healthcare service and effects on consultants' lives. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID19 pandemic has placed increased pressure on service provision and consultant wellness. This further supports the longstanding need to increase mental health service investment in Ireland.","Kelleher, Eric; Geary, Eoin; Tawfik, Mary; Ní Mhuircheartaigh, Eimear; Gavin, Blánaid; Wall, Mary; Lyne, John; Doherty, Anne M; McNicholas, Fiona",Ir J Psychol Med,,424

283538,Why the ABCs Matter More than Ever in Medical Education,2020,"Introduction Pneumothorax is a rare complication among mechanically ventilated patients and is even higher in patients with high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). Herein we describe a case series of nine patients who were intubated due to acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS) secondary to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and developed pneumothorax in due course. Case Description Nine patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who were on ventilators and eventually developed pneumothorax were analyzed retrospectively and outcomes were studied. The characteristics of patients like age, gender, and body mass index (BMI) were compared. Past medical history including smoking history was taking into consideration as well. We compared the total number of days on the ventilator, the highest PEEP they received, and the ventilator day when pneumothorax developed. Treatment: Cases 1,2,3,5,8 and 9 were treated with high dose steroids, hydroxychloroquine, tocilizumab, and convalescent plasma. Case 9 was treated with remdesivir. Case 7 received a high dose of steroids and hydroxychloroquine. Cases 4 and 6 were treated only with hydroxychloroquine. All patients died at the end of their hospital stay. Discussion Patients with COVID19 are at a higher risk of pneumothorax due to severe inflammation. It can be seen in any stage of the disease and might not be associated with the severity of the illness. Bullae formation and pneumothorax can be seen in previously healthy lungs. In our case-series of patients with COVID-19 who developed a pneumothorax, the mortality was noted to be 100%. The majority of patients were non-smokers and had no history of lung disease. Only one patient was a former smoker and had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. High PEEP & low Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) strategy is commonly used in patients with ARDS who are on a ventilator. As per NIH NHLBI ARDS Clinical Network Mechanical Ventilation Protocol, patients with ARDS and mechanical ventilation can be managed with 2 strategies: high PEEP, low FiO2, or low PEEP, high FiO2. Literature suggests that there is no significant difference between the outcomes in the two strategies. COVID-19 is a new illness with no specific guidelines on the management of ventilators. Intensivists should be cautious while maintaining PEEP in such patients and all efforts should be made to prevent pneumothorax. High FiO2 and low PEEP strategy should be considered while managing patients with COVID19 who are on a ventilator. There is a need for large-scale studies to co-relate with these outcomes.","Chandna, S.; Shah, M.

The innovative 2-week curriculum incorporated diverse teaching modalities including live and recorded lectures;live and recorded video demonstrations;interactive small group discussions;interactive virtual sign-outs;and written and multimedia assignments, quizzes, and projects. The virtual elective ran from March to July 2020 with 52 total participating medical students. On post-rotation evaluations, students rated the pathology virtual elective 4.7/5.0 compared to other virtual rotations and 4.0/5.0 compared to all rotations (including in-person and virtual). Furthermore, continual improvements were made to the established framework based on rotation feedback such that curriculum content was more abundant and more favorably rated by the last cohort when compared to the first. Finally, although students identified interest in over 10 different medical specialties, all participants expressed increased interest in choosing pathology as a specialty and better understanding of pathology’s role in patient care.

Prior studies have established hematologic cancers as a risk factor associated with particularly poor outcomes from COVID-19. To our knowledge, no studies have established a beneficial role for anti-COVID-19 interventions in this at-risk population. Convalescent plasma therapy may benefit immunocompromised individuals with COVID-19, including those with hematologic cancers. Objective: To evaluate the association of convalescent plasma treatment with 30-day mortality in hospitalized adults with hematologic cancers and COVID-19 from a multi-institutional cohort. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study using data from the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium registry with propensity score matching evaluated patients with hematologic cancers who were hospitalized for COVID-19. Data were collected between March 17, 2020, and January 21, 2021. Exposures: Convalescent plasma treatment at any time during hospitalization. Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was 30-day all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis with adjustment for potential confounders was performed. Hazard ratios (HRs) are reported with 95% CIs. Secondary subgroup analyses were conducted on patients with severe COVID-19 who required mechanical ventilatory support and/or intensive care unit admission. Results: A total of 966 individuals (mean [SD] age, 65 [15] years; 539 [55.8%] male) were evaluated in this study; 143 convalescent plasma recipients were compared with 823 untreated control patients. After adjustment for potential confounding factors, convalescent plasma treatment was associated with improved 30-day mortality (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.37-0.97). This association remained significant after propensity score matching (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.29-0.92). Among the 338 patients admitted to the intensive care unit, mortality was significantly lower in convalescent plasma recipients compared with nonrecipients (HR for propensity score-matched comparison, 0.40; 95% CI, 0.20-0.80). Among the 227 patients who required mechanical ventilatory support, mortality was significantly lower in convalescent plasma recipients compared with nonrecipients (HR for propensity score-matched comparison, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.14-0.72).

286065,Industry volatility and economic uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from wavelet coherence analysis,2020,"OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to (1) determine to what degree prenatal care was able to be transitioned to telehealth at prenatal practices associated with two affiliated hospitals in New York City during the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and (2) describe providers' experience with this transition. STUDY DESIGN: Trends in whether prenatal care visits were conducted in-person or via telehealth were analyzed by week for a 5-week period from March 9 to April 12 at Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC)-affiliated prenatal practices in New York City during the COVID-19 pandemic. Visits were analyzed for maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) and general obstetrical faculty practices, as well as a clinic system serving patients with public insurance. The proportion of visits that were telehealth was analyzed by visit type by week. A survey and semistructured interviews of providers were conducted evaluating resources and obstacles in the uptake of telehealth. RESULTS: During the study period, there were 4,248 visits, of which approximately one-third were performed by telehealth (n = 1,352, 31.8%). By the fifth week, 56.1% of generalist visits, 61.5% of MFM visits, and 41.5% of clinic visits were performed via telehealth. A total of 36 providers completed the survey and 11 were interviewed. Accessing technology and performing visits, documentation, and follow-up using the telehealth electronic medical record were all viewed favorably by providers. In transitioning to telehealth, operational challenges were more significant for health clinics than for MFM and generalist faculty practices with patients receiving public insurance experiencing greater difficulties and barriers to care. Additional resources on the patient and operational level were required to optimize attendance at in-person and video visits for clinic patients. CONCLUSION: Telehealth was rapidly implemented in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic and was viewed favorably by providers. Limited barriers to care were observed for practices serving patients with commercial insurance. However, to optimize access for patients with Medicaid, additional patient-level and operational supports were required. KEY POINTS: · Telehealth uptake differed based on insurance.. · Medicaid patients may require increased assistance for telehealth.. · Quick adoption of telehealth is feasible..","Madden, Nigel; Emeruwa, Ukachi N; Friedman, Alexander M; Aubey, Janice J; Aziz, Aleha; Baptiste, Caitlin D; Coletta, Jaclyn M; D039,; Alton, Mary E; Fuchs, Karin M; Goffman, Dena; Gyamfi-Bannerman, Cynthia; Kondragunta, Sneha; Krenitsky, Nicole; Miller, Russell S; Nhan-Chang, Chia-Ling; Saint Jean, Ashanda M; Shukla, Hemangi P; Simpson, Lynn L; Spiegel, Erica S; Yates, Hope S; Zork, Noelia; Ona, Samsiya",Am J Perinatol,,424

This study also seeks to develop many identical mobile robots to be used in concerned places, such as hospitals or clinics, to reduce the risk of infection to medical personnel when entering the controlled area COVID-19-patients. This paper presents the design and implementation of real-time vision systems for the RTAF nursing robots when used in the controlled area of COVID-19-patients, with a capacity of delivering food and medical supplies automatically. The robots were able to follow lines on the floor using visual feedback. A contour tracing algorithm was implemented for line identification and position estimation. Linear segments with parabolic blends were used for the robot’s trajectory planning. The robot can track a line on the floor effectively by employing a PID controller. This experimental result showed that the developed vision-based state estimation and the designed PID controller. It was also found that it received a good satisfaction towards the accuracy of the position within 3.5 centimeters, i.e., The distance from the center of the robot to the center of the line.","Moudpoklang, Jeerasak Pedchote Chamnan",IOP Conference Series.

The aim of the current investigation was to identify the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and enriched pathways in COVID-19 infection and its associated complications by bioinformatics analysis, and to provide potential targets for diagnosis and treatment. Valid next-generation sequencing (NGS) data of 93 COVID 19 samples and 100 non COVID 19 samples (GSE156063) were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Gene ontology (GO) and REACTOME pathway enrichment analysis was conducted to identify the biological role of DEGs. In addition, a protein-protein interaction network, modules, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network, TF-hub gene regulatory network and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were used to identify the key genes. A total of 738 DEGs were identified, including 415 up regulated genes and 323 down regulated genes. Most of the DEGs were significantly enriched in immune system process, cell communication, immune system and signaling by NTRK1 (TRKA). Through PPI, modules, miRNA-hub gene regulatory network, TF-hub gene regulatory network analysis, ESR1, UBD, FYN, STAT1, ISG15, EGR1, ARRB2, UBE2D1, PRKDC and FOS were selected as hub genes, which were expressed in COVID-19 samples relative to those in non COVID-19 samples, respectively. Among them, ESR1, UBD, FYN, STAT1, ISG15, EGR1, ARRB2, UBE2D1, PRKDC and FOS were suggested to be diagonstic factors for COVID-19. The findings from this bioinformatics analysis study identified molecular mechanisms and the key hub genes that might contribute to COVID-19 infection and its associated complications.","Vastrad, Basavaraj Mallikarjunayya; Vastrad, Chanabasayya Mallikarjunayya",,,424

To control this imminent threat, Jordan has enforced public health infection prevention and control measures, called for social distancing, seized all forms of inbound and outbound movement/ international travel, and enacted the Defence Law that transferred the authority to Minister of Defence to work and formulate orders according to the situation. In an effort to support the government in anticipating the requirements of the health system in the upcoming period, an in-depth reflection and examination of different scenarios of the disease spread were developed. This viewpoint suggested different strategies and measures for case detection and contact tracing, clinical management of cases, public health system functioning, and civil society organizations contribution. It is necessary to accelerate containment of the disease to protect the economy and to maintain the continuity of some activities to mitigate the subsequent social, economic and financial impacts. This requires finding a coping mechanism for a period that may be prolonged until laboratories develop a vaccine. In specific, it is strongly recommended to promote community health awareness towards public health prevention and control measures, increase the efficiency and comprehensiveness of the epidemiological investigation/ active and passive surveillance, and employ technology and digital health solutions to track cases and contacts. It is also recommended to increase and expand resources of intensive care units including respirators, increase the capacity and the number of trained health staff in the area of public health and epidemiology, ensure continued provision of essential public health programs and mobilize the resources of non-governmental sector and donors to provide services for refugees and vulnerable populations.","Alqutob, Raeda; Al Nsour, Mohannad; Tarawneh, Mohammad Rasoul; Ajlouni, Musa; Khader, Yousef; Aqel, Ibrahim; Kharabsheh, Saad; Obeidat, Nathir",,,424
291679,Normative positions towards COVID-19 contact-tracing apps: findings from a large-scale qualitative study in nine European countries,2021,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first detected in Madrid, Spain, on 25 February 2020. It increased in frequency very fast and by the end of May more than 70,000 cases had been confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). To study the lineages and the diversity of the viral population during this first epidemic wave in Madrid we sequenced 224 SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes collected from three hospitals from February to May 2020. All the known major lineages were found in this set of samples, though B.1 and B.1.5 were the most frequent ones, accounting for more than 60% of the sequences. In parallel with the B lineages and sublineages, the D614G mutation in the Spike protein sequence was detected soon after the detection of the first coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) case in Madrid and in two weeks became dominant, being found in 80% of the samples and remaining at this level during all the study periods. The lineage composition of the viral population found in Madrid was more similar to the European population than to the publicly available Spanish data, underlining the role of Madrid as a national and international transport hub. In agreement with this, phylodynamic analysis suggested multiple independent entries before the national lockdown and air transportation restrictions.","Viedma, Esther; Dahdouh, Elias; González-Alba, José María; González-Bodi, Sara; Martínez-García, Laura; Lázaro-Perona, Fernando; Recio, Raúl; Rodríguez-Tejedor, María; Folgueira, María Dolores; Cantón, Rafael; Delgado, Rafael; García-Rodríguez, Julio; Galán, Juan Carlos; Mingorance, Jesús",,,424

Educational policy directions beyond the pandemic,2020,"In 2020, a highly infective new pathogen (Sars-CoV-2) spread from China to the whole globe, and became responsible of an acute respiratory syndrome, often asymptomatic but potentially lethal, named COVID-19. Airborne and direct contact contamination are the major infection pathways of Sars-CoV-2 and it has been shown that virus spread can also happen in absence of clinical symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 transmission during dental procedures can happen through inhalation of droplets from infected patients or direct contact with mucous membranes, oral fluids, and contaminated instruments. Both sinus lift and implant surgeries often involve bleeding and exposure to oral fluids, and a rubber dam could be used to reduce direct contact and the amount of potentially infected aerosol. The aim of this short case presentation is to illustrate how the use of a rubber dam could be extremely useful in preventing COVID-19 exposure during flapless trans-crestal sinus lift procedures.","Checchi, Vittorio; Generali, Luigi; Generali, Paolo",J. oral implantol,,424
293113,Successful Anesthetic Management in Cesarean Section for Pregnant Woman with COVID-19,2020,"Acetaminophen (APAP) is one of the few recommended analgesic and antipyretic drugs in some critical cases such as viral disease COVID-19. However, the unrestricted use of APAP develops liver disorders. Hepatotoxicity and liver injury can also be induced by ionizing radiation (IR) during radiotherapy. The data of the current study represents that treatment of rats with either APAP-overdose, or gamma-irradiation (R) induces hepatotoxicity, results in significant increases of the hepatic-enzymes activities (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT, LDH, and MDH), as well as enhancement of triglycerides, total cholesterol levels, combined with declines in albumin and total protein contents. An enhancement of the lipid peroxides (malondialdehyde; MDA), and nitric oxide levels along with a decline of reduced glutathione contents and suppression of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities are also observed within the liver tissues of intoxicated animals. TNF-&#945;, IL-1ß, IL-6, iNOS, Cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1), miR-802 gene expression, NF-&#954;B, and calcium levels are up-regulated, while Nuclear factor erythroid-related factor-2 (Nrf2), Hemoxygenase-1 (HO-1) protein and gene expressions, as well as, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC), NAD(P)H-Quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), and miR-122 gene expressions are down-regulated in the livers of intoxicated animals. All these parameters show significant improvement in R/APAP intoxicated animals. Curcumin pretreatment develops an amelioration of these effects in APAP-overdose, R-exposure, or R/APAP treatments. In conclusion, oral administration of curcumin shows hepatoprotective effects against APAP-overdose induced hepatic damage in normal and gamma-irradiated rats through prospective regulation of the therapeutic targets CYP2E1, Nrf2, and NF-&#954;B, via organizing the miR-122 and miR-802 gene expression.","Eassawy, Mamdouh M T; Salem, Asmaa A; Ismail, Amel F M",Environ. toxicol,,424

A secondary concern is to mitigate the severe economic consequences of the crisis. Different approaches have been adopted with varying outcomes and experiences. But regardless of the different approaches taken, one thing is common for all societies during this pandemic: fear and anxiety. This fear extends from concerns about the present situation, for the health and well-being of family members and loved ones from Covid-19 infection, to fears relating to how long the crisis will last, to the potential economic consequences of the pandemic (perhaps not seen in our lifetimes) and the ultimate fear of future uncertainty. Across the world, health systems are being faced with unprecedented challenges. At their core, these challenges are the same: how to beat Covid-19.

296577,"""It's Never Too Late"": High School Counselors' Support of Underrepresented Students' Interest in STEM",2021,"The special issue dedicated to events and sustainability is introduced here. We provide synopses of the papers, preceded by an introductory essay that examines how event studies has approached the relationship between events and sustainable development. Existing work too often assumes that sustainability means reducing negative environmental impacts with other aspects of the sustainability paradigm neglected. And whilst social issues have risen to prominence in events research generally, this work is usually considered outwith sustainability debates, and without considering environmental and economic interrelationships. We argue that event scholars should examine how events might contribute to sustainable development, rather than merely exploring how individual events could be made more sustainable. Accordingly, there needs to be further work addressing how events might change attitudes and behaviours by promoting sustainable lifestyles, communities and technologies. Following this discussion, we justify the focus on social sustainability in the special issue, clarify what this actually means, and question whether this is always the most appropriate way of framing research on the social impacts of events. Given the timing of the special issue, there is also a short review of how the coronavirus crisis affected the events sector, and what the implications might be for sustainability.

296720,Patients with RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 and Normal Chest CT,2020,"BACKGROUND: Nasopharyngeal specimens (NPS) are commonly used for SARS-CoV-2 testing but can be uncomfortable for patients. Self-collected saliva or anterior nasal specimens (ANS) for SARS-CoV-2 detection are less invasive but the sensitivity of these specimen types has not been thoroughly evaluated. METHODS: During September-November 2020, 730 adults undergoing SARS-CoV-2 testing at community testing events and homeless shelters in Denver provided self-collected saliva and ANS specimens before NPS collection and answered a short survey about symptoms and specimen preference. Specimens were tested for SARS-CoV-2 by rRT-PCR; viral culture was performed on a subset of specimens positive by rRT-PCR. Sensitivity of saliva and ANS for SARS-CoV-2 detection by rRT-PCR was measured against NPS. Subgroup analyses included test outcomes by symptom status and culture results. RESULTS: Sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2 detection by rRT-PCR appeared higher for saliva than for ANS (85% vs. 80%) and among symptomatic participants than among those without symptoms (94% vs. 29% for saliva; 87% vs. 50% for ANS). Among participants with culture-positive SARS-CoV-2 by any specimen type, sensitivity of saliva and ANS by rRT-PCR was 94% and 100%, respectively. Saliva and ANS were equally preferred by participants; most would undergo NPS again despite being least preferred. CONCLUSIONS: Saliva was slightly more sensitive than ANS for SARS-CoV-2 detection by rRT-PCR. Both saliva and ANS reliably detected SARS-CoV-2 among participants with symptoms. Self-collected saliva and ANS offer practical advantages, are preferred by patients, and might be most useful for testing people with COVID-19 symptoms.","Marx, Grace E; Biggerstaff, Brad J; Nawrocki, Courtney C; Totten, Sarah E; Travanty, Emily A; Burakoff, Alexis W; Scott, Tracy; De Hey, Jesse Chavez-Van; Carlson, Jesse J; Wendel, Karen A; Harcourt, Jennifer L; Tamin, Azaibi; Thomas, Jennifer D; Rowan, Sarah E",Clin. infect. dis,,424

To compare maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnant women with those of non-infected patients. STUDY DESIGN: Through an universal PCR testing for SARS-COV-2 at admission (not symptoms-based), this prospective cohort study enrolled all pregnant women admitted for delivery between 16th of June and the 16th of August 2020 in the West French Guiana Hospital Center. RESULTS: 507 pregnant women were included during the study period, of which 137 (27 %) were infected with SARS-COV-2. On admission, only 34/137 (24.8 %) of these patients presented with clinical symptoms. Among asymptomatic women, 16 /103 (15 %) became symptomatic after diagnosis. Throughout the delivery hospitalization and follow-up, 87/137 (63.5 %) remained always asymptomatic, 45/137 (32.8 %) developed a mild COVID-19 and 5/137 (3.6 %) developed a severe infection. SARS-CoV-2 infected patients were more likely to have post-partum hemorrhage >500 mL (14.2 % vs 7.2 %, RR 2.0 [95 %CI 1.1-3.4]), to be transfused (5.5 % vs 1.1 %, RR 4.9 [1.5-16.6]), and to be hospitalized in ICU (3.6 % vs 0.8 %, RR 4.5 [95 %CI 1.1-18.6] than uninfected ones. Intra-uterine fetal demises were more common in infected mothers compared to controls (5.1 % vs 1.1 %, RR 4.7 [95 % CI 1.4-45.9). Among 108 neonates from infected mothers tested at birth, none tested positive (0/108). When tested between 25 and 42 h after delivery, 4/29 (13.7 %) were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs and remained asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: Pregnant women admitted for delivery and diagnosed with a SARS-COV-2 infection through an universal screening were symptomatic in only a quarter of cases. Their risks of post-partum hemorrhage, transfusion and admission to ICU were higher than those of uninfected patients. They also presented a higher risk of intra-uterine fetal demise. There were no other differences in maternal, obstetrical or neonatal outcomes.","Hcini, Najeh; Maamri, Fatma; Picone, Olivier; Carod, Jean-Francois; Lambert, Véronique; Mathieu, Meredith; Carles, Gabriel; Pomar, Léo",Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol,,424

299692,Compensating for academic loss: Online learning and student performance during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"OBJECTIVES: Although diffuse alveolar damage, a subtype of acute lung injury (ALI), is the most common microscopic pattern in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), other pathologic patterns have been described. The aim of the study was to review autopsies from COVID-19 decedents to evaluate the spectrum of pathology and correlate the results with clinical, laboratory, and radiologic findings. METHODS: A comprehensive and quantitative review from 40 postmortem examinations was performed. The microscopic patterns were categorized as follows: ""major"" when present in more than 50% of cases and ""novel"" if rarely or not previously described and unexpected clinically. RESULTS: Three major pulmonary patterns were identified: ALI in 29 (73%) of 40, intravascular fibrin or platelet-rich aggregates (IFPAs) in 36 (90%) of 40, and vascular congestion and hemangiomatosis-like change (VCHL) in 20 (50%) of 40. The absence of ALI (non-ALI) was novel and seen in 11 (27%) of 40. Compared with ALI decedents, those with non-ALI had a shorter hospitalization course (P = .02), chest radiographs with no or minimal consolidation (P = .01), and no pathologically confirmed cause of death (9/11). All non-ALI had VCHL and IFPAs, and clinically most had cardiac arrest. CONCLUSIONS: Two distinct pulmonary phenotypic patterns-ALI and non-ALI-were noted. Non-ALI represents a rarely described phenotype. The cause of death in non-ALI is most likely COVID-19 related but requires additional corroboration.","De Michele, Simona; Sun, Yu; Yilmaz, Mine M; Katsyv, Igor; Salvatore, Mary; Dzierba, Amy L; Marboe, Charles C; Brodie, Daniel; Patel, Nina M; Garcia, Christine K; Saqi, Anjali",Am J Clin Pathol,,424
299735,"The revolution will not be peer reviewed: (creative) tensions between academia, social media and anti-racist activism",2020,"During the coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) pandemic, several studies were performed to determine the mortality and incidence rates of coronavirus infection among patients with hemoglobinopathies. However, there has been no systematic approach or meta-analysis to evaluate the results worldwide. This meta-analysis summarized the existing evidence of incidence and mortality rates of COVID-19 and related risk factors among patients with hemoglobinopathies with a focus on ß-thalassemia (ß-thal) and sickle cell disease. The review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. Two authors independently screened the articles, extracted eligible ones, and assessed the quality of studies using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) checklist. The collected data were analyzed by the Stata software. The amount of heterogeneity was demonstrated by the I2 test. The incidence of COVID-19 among patients with a hemoglobinopathy, ß-thal and sickle cell disease was 4.44, 1.34, and 17.22 per 100,000 person-day, respectively, to June 15 2020. The mortality rate of COVID-19 in patients with hemoglobin (Hb) disorders was calculated as 1.07 per 1000 person-day in the same period. Our findings showed a higher incidence rate of COVID-19 in sickle cell disease patients compared to the general population. A slightly higher mortality rate was also observed in patients with hemoglobinopathies compared to the general population, possibly due to the associated risk factors and comorbidities in this vulnerable group, which underscore special care, timely diagnosis and management along with current immunization, were crucial in decreasing the frequency, disease severity and mortality of these patients.","Haghpanah, Sezaneh; Hosseini-Bensenjan, Mahnaz; Sayadi, Mehrab; Karimi, Mehran",Hemoglobin,,424

The model assumes that the probability of events in the initial time period is in line with the Poisson distribution and that the location and priority of each hospital node is known when the material demand is initiated. The priority of hospital nodes is divided into four categories: critical, urgent, priority, and routine. There are several patients with different priorities in a hospital node: critical illness, severe illness, and mild illness. The priority of the hospital node is determined by the overall situation of the hospital patients. The MDP model established in this paper gives how to dispatch limited emergency medical supplies in the dispatching center to make the service rate of the whole system the best. The efficiency of the dispatching center in responding to the material needs of the hospital node depends on the constraints of the number and response time of different priority patients at the node. The maximum effect iterative dynamic model was simulated by simulation experiment and compared with the simulation effect under general conditions, so as to observe whether the model improved the system service rate.

These data are captured by 1 of 13 laboratory information management systems (LIMSs) developed specifically for veterinary diagnostic laboratories (VDLs). Beginning ~2000, the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) developed an electronic messaging system for LIMS to automatically send standardized data streams for 14 select agents to a national repository. This messaging enables the U.S. Department of Agriculture to track and respond to high-consequence animal disease outbreaks such as highly pathogenic avian influenza. Because of the lack of standardized data collection in the LIMSs used at VDLs, there is, to date, no means of summarizing VDL large data streams for multi-state and national animal health studies or for providing near-real-time tracking for hundreds of other important animal diseases in the United States that are detected routinely by VDLs. Further, VDLs are the only state and federal resources that can provide early detection and identification of endemic and emerging zoonotic diseases. Zoonotic diseases are estimated to be responsible for 2.5 billion cases of human illness and 2.7 million deaths worldwide every year. The economic and health impact of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is self-evident.

304512,Portable Health Clinic as a Telemedicine System with Appropriate Technologies for Unreached Communities,2021,"Rationale: Previous studies on the relationship between diabetes and arterial stiffness were mostly cross-sectional. A few longitudinal studies focused on one single direction. Whether the association between arterial stiffness and diabetes is bidirectional remains unclear to date. Objective: To explore the temporal relationship between arterial stiffness and fasting blood glucose (FBG) status. Methods and Results: Included were 14,159 participants of the Kailuan study with assessment of brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) from 2010 to 2015, and free of diabetes, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and chronic kidney disease at baseline. FBG and baPWV were repeatedly measured at baseline and follow-ups. Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of incident diabetes across baseline baPWV groups: <1,400 cm/s (ref), 1,400 {less than or equal to} baPWV < 1,800 cm/s, and {greater than or equal to}1,800cm/s. Path analysis was used to analyze the possible temporal causal relationship between baPWV and FBG, among 8,956 participants with repeated assessment of baPWV and FBG twice in 2010-2017. The mean baseline age of the observed population was 48.3{plus minus}12.0 years. During mean 3.72 years of follow-up, 979 incident diabetes cases were identified. After adjusting for potential confounders, the HR (95% CI) for risk of diabetes was 1.59 (1.34, 1.88) for the borderline arterial stiffness group and 2.11 (1.71, 2.61) for the elevated arterial stiffness group, compared with the normal ideal arterial stiffness group. In the path analysis, baseline baPWV was associated with follow-up FBG (the standard regression coefficient was 0.09; 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.10). In contrast, the standard regression coefficient of baseline FBG for follow-up baPWV (ß = 0.00, 95% CI: -0.02 to 0.02) was not significant.

Major declines in crime have been reported as a result. However, those declines depend on crime type and may differ by parts of a city and land uses. This paper examines burglary in Detroit, Michigan during the month of March, 2020, a period of considerable change in routine activities. We examine 879 block groups, separating those dominated by residential land use from those with more mixed land use. We divide the month into three periods: pre-containment, transition period, and post-containment. Burglaries increase in block groups with mixed land use, but not blocks dominated by residential land use. The impact of containment policies on burglary clarifies after taking land use into account.","Felson, Marcus; Jiang, Shanhe; Xu, Yanqing",Crime Sci.,,424

Methods and Results This study aimed to explore the association between underlying cardio-metabolic disease and mortality with COVID-19 among hospitalized patients. This multicenter, retrospective, and real-world study was conducted from January 22, 2020 to March 25, 2020 in China. Data between patients with and without 5 main cardio-metabolic diseases including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and hyperlipidemia were compared. A total of 1303 hospitalized patients were included in the final analysis. Of them, 520 patients (39.9%) had cardio-metabolic disease. Compared with patients without cardio-metabolic disease, more patients with cardio-metabolic disease had COVID-related complications including acute respiratory distress syndrome (9.81% versus 3.32%; P<0.001), acute kidney injury (4.23% versus 1.40%; P=0.001), secondary infection (13.9% versus 9.8%; P=0.026), hypoproteinemia (12.1% versus 5.75%; P<0.001), and coagulopathy (19.4% versus 10.3%; P<0.001), had higher incidences of the severe type of COVID-19 (32.9% versus 16.7%; P<0.001), more were admitted to the intensive care unit (11.7% versus 7.92%; P=0.021), and required mechanical ventilation (9.8% versus 4.3%; P<0.001). When the number of the patients' cardio-metabolic diseases was 0, 1, and >2, the mortality was 4.2%, 11.1%, and 19.8%, respectively. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of mortality among patients with cardio-metabolic disease was 1.80 (95% CI, 1.17-2.77).

306169,Challenges for medical education in Mexico in the time of COVID-19,2020,"BACKGROUND: The spread of the 2019 novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, across Asia and Europe sparked a significant increase in public interest and media coverage, including on social media platforms such as Twitter. In this context, the origin of information plays a central role in the dissemination of evidence-based information about the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19. On February 2, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) constituted a ""massive infodemic"" and argued that this situation ""makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it."" OBJECTIVE: This infoveillance study, conducted during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, focuses on the social media platform Twitter. It allows monitoring of the dynamic pandemic situation on a global scale for different aspects and topics, languages, as well as regions and even whole countries. Of particular interest are temporal and geographical variations of COVID-19-related tweets, the situation in Europe, and the categories and origin of shared external resources. METHODS: Twitter's Streaming application programming interface was used to filter tweets based on 16 prevalent hashtags related to the COVID-19 outbreak. Each tweet's text and corresponding metadata as well as the user's profile information were extracted and stored into a database. Metadata included links to external resources. A link categorization scheme-introduced in a study by Chew and Eysenbach in 2009-was applied onto the top 250 shared resources to analyze the relative proportion for each category. Moreover, temporal variations of global tweet volumes were analyzed and a specific analysis was conducted for the European region. RESULTS: Between February 9 and April 11, 2020, a total of 21,755,802 distinct tweets were collected, posted by 4,809,842 distinct Twitter accounts. The volume of #covid19-related tweets increased after the WHO announced the name of the new disease on February 11, 2020, and stabilized at the end of March at a high level. For the regional analysis, a higher tweet volume was observed in the vicinity of major European capitals or in densely populated areas. The most frequently shared resources originated from various social media platforms (ranks 1-7). The most prevalent category in the top 50 was ""Mainstream or Local News."" For the category ""Government or Public Health,"" only two information sources were found in the top 50: US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention at rank 25 and the WHO at rank 27. The first occurrence of a prevalent scientific source was Nature (rank 116). CONCLUSIONS: The naming of the disease by the WHO was a major signal to address the public audience with public health response via social media platforms such as Twitter. Future studies should focus on the origin and trustworthiness of shared resources, as monitoring the spread of fake news during a pandemic situation is of particular importance. In addition, it would be beneficial to analyze and uncover bot networks spreading COVID-19-related misinformation.","Pobiruchin, Monika; Zowalla, Richard; Wiesner, Martin",J Med Internet Res,,424

306913,La coopération sanitaire internationale à l’épreuve du COVID-19,2020,"The pandemic caused by Sars-CoV-2 (COVID-19) has been a great concern for public and mental health systems worldwide. The identification of risk groups is essential for the establishment of preventive and therapeutic strategies, as for substance users. During COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in the use of psychoactive substances during the lockdown, including cannabis. This commentary reviews relevant findings and discusses scientific evidence on the risks of worse clinical and psychiatric complications due to coronavirus disease COVID-19 in subjects who use cannabis. Although they are not included as a risk group in the health recommendations for that disease, they may have a more vulnerable respiratory system to viral diseases. There are certain similarities between the harmful cardiovascular and respiratory effects of cannabis use and those of smoking. Due to the different modes of smoking, cannabis chemicals are retained in the body for longe and may also contain other toxic substances such as tar, a substance found in tobacco and which has been associated with the development of lung cancer, bronchitis and pulmonary emphysema. Therefore, we discuss if individuals who use cannabis regularly might be more vulnerable to COVID-19 infection. This population deserves more clinical attention worldwide and this manuscript can help clinicians become more aware of cannabis risks during pandemics and develop specific intervention strategies.","Borgonhi, Ellen Mello; Volpatto, Vanessa Loss; Ornell, Felipe; Rabelo-da-Ponte, Francisco Diego; Kessler, Felix Henrique Paim",Addict Sci Clin Pract,,424
307160,Saint Roch and Social Distancing During Pandemics: Lessons to be Remembered,2021,"OBJECTIVE: People with chronic conditions are known to be vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to describe patients' lived experiences, challenges faced by people with chronic conditions, their coping strategies, and the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a qualitative study using a syndemic framework to understand the patients' experiences of chronic disease care, challenges faced during the lockdown, their coping strategies and mitigators during the COVID-19 pandemic in the context of socioecological and biological factors. A diverse sample of 41 participants with chronic conditions (hypertension, diabetes, stroke and cardiovascular diseases) from four sites (Delhi, Haryana, Vizag and Chennai) in India participated in semistructured interviews. All interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, translated, anonymised and coded using MAXQDA software. We used the framework method to qualitatively analyse the COVID-19 pandemic impacts on health, social and economic well-being. RESULTS: Participant experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic were categorised into four themes: challenges faced during the lockdown, experiences of the participants diagnosed with COVID-19, preventive measures taken and lessons learnt during the COVID-19 pandemic. A subgroup of participants faced difficulties in accessing healthcare while a few reported using teleconsultations. Most participants reported adverse economic impact of the pandemic which led to higher reporting of anxiety and stress. Participants who tested COVID-19 positive reported experiencing discrimination and stigma from neighbours. All participants reported taking essential preventive measures. CONCLUSION: People with chronic conditions experienced a confluence (reciprocal effect) of COVID-19 pandemic and chronic diseases in the context of difficulty in accessing healthcare, sedentary lifestyle and increased stress and anxiety. Patients' lived experiences during the pandemic provide important insights to inform effective transition to a mixed realm of online consultations and 'distanced' physical clinic visits.","Singh, Kavita; Kaushik, Aprajita; Johnson, Leslie; Jaganathan, Suganthi; Jarhyan, Prashant; Deepa, Mohan; Kong, Sandra; Venkateshmurthy, Nikhil Srinivasapura; Kondal, Dimple; Mohan, Sailesh; Anjana, Ranjit Mohan; Ali, Mohammed K; Tandon, Nikhil; Narayan, K M Venkat; Mohan, Viswanathan; Eggleston, Karen; Prabhakaran, Dorairaj",BMJ Open,,424

Many clinical trials are now being conducted to test possible therapies. To assist this, virtual screening via molecular docking was performed on several FDA-approved drugs, previously used in epidemics, and the top ten compounds were selected. These ten well-characterized drugs, previously used to treat malaria and Ebola infections, were screened based on their interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 ACE2 receptor and 3C-like protease. Compared to the other nine medicines, brincidofovir, an ether lipid ester analog of cidofovir with potent antiviral activity, showed the highest docking scores and binding interactions. Therefore, brincidofovir is worth further investigations and clinical trials as a possible therapeutic agent for the COVID-19 disease caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2.

309441,An Assessment of the Feasibility and Effectiveness of Distance Learning for Students With Severe Developmental Disabilities and High Behavioral Needs,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 entrance to the host cells is started by the interaction between receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike (S) protein on the virus with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor which is very important in the onset of viral infection. Interference with this interaction can be a promising way to prevent Covid-19 infection. In this study, a novel potential therapeutic peptide was designed in silico based on the key interacting amino acids of ACE2 against SARS-CoV-2 S protein. In our computational analysis, a peptide consisting of residues 19–48 of ACE2 was chosen as the wild-type peptide. Based on this peptide, six mutant peptides (Mu_P1-6) were designed and then assessed in term of interaction with S protein. The result of protein-peptide docking by HADDOCK web server and then immunological analysis by SVMTriP epitope prediction tool leads to choose Mu_P3 as the best mutant. Molecular dynamics simulations of wild-type peptide-S protein complex and Mu_P3-S protein complex, showed Mu_P3 has better interaction with S protein than wild type peptide (interaction energies − 8 9 7. 1 4 vs. − 7 8 4. 1 3 (kJ/mol)) which can be a potential therapeutic peptide for Covid-19 pandemic. The aim of this study was in silico design of a therapeutic peptide against SARS-CoV-2 S protein. Six mutant peptides (Mu_P1-6) were designed and then their interaction potential with S protein was assessed by molecular docking and molecular dynamics which Mu_P3 showed the properties of a potential therapeutic peptide.

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective clinical study. METHODS: Six eyes of three patients (6-day-old girl, 5-month-old girl, and 14-day-old boy) with IP were examined and treated under general anesthesia. Ophthalmologic examinations were performed including images from wide-angle fluorescein angiography (FA), swept-source optical coherence tomography (OCT), and OCT angiography (OCTA). RESULTS: Ophthalmoscopy showed prominent vascular tortuosity in five eyes, retinal hemorrhages in four eyes, and incomplete vascular development in two eyes. FA showed extensive avascularity including the posterior pole of the retina in all cases except one eye. Prompt and intensive laser photocoagulation stabilized the pre-proliferative severe retinopathy in five eyes; however, foveal structure and vessel anomalies were detected in three of six eyes by OCT and two of five eyes by OCTA. CONCLUSION: Severe retinopathy in the neonatal period and infancy was present not only in the periphery but also in the posterior pole including the fovea, which might be related to retinal vascular maldevelopment. It is, therefore, recommended that wide-angle fundus FA examination be performed in the early postnatal period to detect early signs of severe retinopathy in infants with IP.","Nakao, Shiro; Nishina, Sachiko; Tanaka, Shin; Yoshida, Tomoyo; Yokoi, Tadashi; Azuma, Noriyuki",Jpn. j. ophthalmol,,424

Information about the topic has been provided.Globally, as of mid-May 2020, there have been over 4.4 million confirmed cases of COVID-19. There are two main routes of transmission of COVID-19: respiratory droplets and contact transmission. PFTs are non-invasive tests that are commonly performed in routine assessment and follow-up of patients in the pulmonology units. However, PFTs may generate aerosols and require sharing common surfaces. With regard to the high prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the community, PFTs should not be performed routinely in confirmed or suspected patients with COVID-19 during the pandemic. Because of the risk of human-to-human transmission of COVID-19, PFTs should be restricted to a small patient population with selected indications. Triage for COVID-19 should be performed prior to testing. Only essential PFTs such as spirometry, diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), arterial blood gas analysis, or pulse oximetry should be performed in the selected cases. Tests should be scheduled to allow sufficient time for donning and doffing of the technical personnel with the full personal protective equipment (PPE) (gown, a filtering respirator mask, goggles or full-face shield, and disposable gloves), ventilation of the room, and application of post-test cleaning and disinfection procedures of the equipment and the testing room.","Gemicioglu, Bilun; Börekçi, Sermin; Dilektasli, Asli Görek; Ulubay, Gaye; Azap, Özlem; Saryal, Sevgi",Turk Thorac J,,424

Melatonin is effective in critical care patients by reducing vessel permeability, anxiety, sedation use, and improving sleeping quality, which might also be beneficial for better clinical outcomes for COVID-19 patients. Notably, melatonin has a high safety profile. There is significant data showing that melatonin limits virus-related diseases and would also likely be beneficial in COVID-19 patients. Additional experiments and clinical studies are required to confirm this speculation.","Zhang, Rui; Wang, Xuebin; Ni, Leng; Di, Xiao; Ma, Baitao; Niu, Shuai; Liu, Changwei; Reiter, Russel J",Life Sci,,424

In a previous study, the effects of thermal resistance of insulation pads, and latent heat and melting temperature of PCMs on the HPCS's thermal performance have been investigated. In addition to the aforementioned factors, environmental conditions, i.e., ambient temperature and relative humidity, also significantly affect the thermal performance of the HPCS.

314155,COVID-19: An update on the epidemiological status of south india,2020,"Rationale: Though the United States has the highest number of ICU beds per capita in the world, the regional distribution of these beds is variable. Rural areas have 1% of American ICU beds despite having 16% of the country's population. Telehealth is frequently promoted as a tool that can augment care for the critically ill in rural communities. Yet, ICU telehealth still requires clinicians at the bedside who are able to provide critical care. We sought to examine telemedicine within rural ICUs in the context of potential workforce shortages related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We identified all hospitals with ICUs in Michigan using the 2018 American Hospital Association annual survey database and internet searches. Within each hospital, an ICU physician or nurse leader was surveyed between April 6, 2020 and May 8, 2020. At that time, the state of Michigan had the fifth highest total of COVID-19 hospitalizations within the country. Participants were asked about current telehealth utilization in the ICU. Participants were also asked to rate their concern on a 4-point Likert scale regarding exceeding existing ICU capacity and ICU staffing capabilities due to the pandemic. Results: Of the 28 rural hospitals in Michigan, 14 were surveyed (response rate 50%). Among responding hospitals, 12 (86%) had fewer than 11 ICU beds and an average pre-COVID-19 census of fewer than 4 patients. At the time of the survey, ten hospitals (71%) reported using ICU telehealth support, of which two used telehealth providers exclusively overnight. Of the four hospitals without telehealth, two planned to add telehealth in response to the pandemic. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, 11 hospitals (79%) reported concern about exceeding their ICU capacity, and 12 hospitals (86%) planned to create more ICU beds. The majority of rural hospitals worried about impending ICU workforce shortages, with 78% of hospitals concerned about having enough nurses, 64% about having enough respiratory therapists, and 50% about having enough physicians as a result of the pandemic. Conclusions: At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, most rural hospitals in Michigan utilized ICU telehealth support in some capacity. Despite broad use of telemedicine, rural hospitals remained concerned about exceeding ICU capacity and a lack of ICU nurses, respiratory therapists, and physicians. Expansion of existing telehealth infrastructures within rural hospitals may improve access to critical care clinicians virtually but would not ease concerns related to capacity and workforce shortages, particularly among ICU-trained nurses.","Epler, K.

In contrast, interferons are a crucial component of host antiviral immunity and can be directly suppressed by glucocorticoids. To investigate whether therapeutic interferons can compensate glucocorticoids-induced loss of antiviral immunity, we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 387 PCR-confirmed COVID-19 patients with quasi-random exposure to interferons and conditional exposure to glucocorticoids. Among patients receiving glucocorticoids, early interferon therapy was associated with earlier hospital discharge (adjusted HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.19-2.37) and symptom relief (adjusted HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06-2.08), while these associations were insignificant among glucocorticoids nonusers. Early interferon therapy was also associated with lower prevalence of prolonged viral shedding (adjusted OR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10-0.57) only among glucocorticoids users. Additionally, these associations were glucocorticoid cumulative dose- and timing-dependent. These findings reveal potential therapeutic synergy between interferons and glucocorticoids in COVID-19 that warrants further investigation.","Lu, Yingying; Liu, Feng; Tong, Gangling; Qiu, Feng; Song, Pinhong; Wang, Xiaolin; Zou, Xiafei; Wan, Deyun; Cui, Miao; Xu, Yunsheng; Zheng, Zhihua; Hong, Peng",Signal Transduct Target Ther,,424

Transfusion of convalescent blood products (CBP), especially convalescent plasma (CP), is useful if the latter induces neutralizing antibodies against emerging infectious agents. CBPs are extracted from a convalescent source by collecting whole blood or plasma apheresis. Passive immunization therapy was successfully implemented back to the 1890s to treat infectious diseases. An individual who is ill with infectious diseases and is recovering has blood drawn and screened for antibodies neutralizing specific microorganisms. After identifying those with high titers of neutralizing antibody, convalescent plasma containing such neutralizing antibodies can be administered to minimize symptoms and mortality in individuals with a specified clinical disease.

317962,Causes and Impacts of Job Displacements and Public Policy Responses,2020,"A recent report identified significant reductions or disappearance of viral load in COVID-19 patients given a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. The present communication discusses some common pharmacokinetic properties of these two drugs that may be linked to a potential underlying mechanism of action for these antiviral effects. The physicochemical properties of both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are consistent with particularly high affinity for the intracellular lysosomal space, which has been implicated as a target site for antiviral activity. The properties of both drugs predict dramatic accumulation in lysosomes, with calculated lysosomal drug concentrations that exceed cytosolic and extracellular concentrations by more than 50 000-fold. These predictions are consistent with previously reported experimentally measured cellular and extracellular concentrations of azithromycin. This is also reflected in the very large volumes of distribution of these drugs, which are among the highest of all drugs currently in use. The combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin produces very high local concentrations in lysosomes. The clinical significance of this observation is unclear; however, the magnitude of this mechanism of drug accumulation via ion-trapping in lysosomes could be an important factor for the pharmacodynamic effects of this drug combination.","Derendorf, Hartmut",Int J Antimicrob Agents,,424

To date, no specific therapeutic drug or vaccine for treating COVID-19 and SARS has been FDA approved. Previous studies suggest that berberine, an isoquinoline alkaloid, has shown various biological activities that may help against COVID-19 and SARS, including antiviral, anti-allergy and inflammation, hepatoprotection against drug- and infection-induced liver injury, as well as reducing oxidative stress. In particular, berberine has a wide range of antiviral activities such as anti-influenza, anti-hepatitis C, anti-cytomegalovirus, and anti-alphavirus. As an ingredient recommended in guidelines issued by the China National Health Commission for COVID-19 to be combined with other therapy, berberine is a promising orally administered therapeutic candidate against SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The current study comprehensively evaluates the potential therapeutic mechanisms of berberine in preventing and treating COVID-19 and SARS using computational modeling, including target mining, gene ontology enrichment, pathway analyses, protein-protein interaction analysis, and in silico molecular docking. An orally available immunotherapeutic-berberine nanomedicine, named NIT-X, has been developed by our group and has shown significantly increased oral bioavailability of berberine, increased IFN-Î³ production by CD8+ T cells, and inhibition of mast cell histamine release in vivo, suggesting a protective immune response. We further validated the inhibition of replication of SARS-CoV-2 in lung epithelial cells line in vitro (Calu3 cells) by berberine. Moreover, the expression of targets including ACE2, TMPRSS2, IL-1&#945;, IL-8, IL-6, and CCL-2 in SARS-CoV-2 infected Calu3 cells were significantly suppressed by NIT-X. By supporting protective immunity while inhibiting pro-inflammatory cytokines; inhibiting viral infection and replication; inducing apoptosis; and protecting against tissue damage, berberine is a promising candidate in preventing and treating COVID-19 and SARS. Given the high oral bioavailability and safety of berberine nanomedicine, the current study may lead to the development of berberine as an orally, active therapeutic against COVID-19 and SARS.","Wang, Zhen-Zhen; Li, Kun; Maskey, Anish R; Huang, Weihua; Toutov, Anton A; Yang, Nan; Srivastava, Kamal; Geliebter, Jan; Tiwari, Raj; Miao, Mingsan; Li, Xiu-Min",FASEB J,,424

INTERVENTION: This project was undertaken in four phases. During phase 1, an informal discussion was held with the breastfeeding mothers, service providers, and community partner in identifying issues surrounding lactation counselling facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. During phase 2, recommendations from 23 organizations with regard to breastfeeding during COVID-19 were reviewed and analyzed. During phase 3, using evidence from reliable sources, a 5-minute animated e-resource on breastfeeding during COVID-19 was conceptualized and developed. During phase 4, the e-resource was disseminated to the breastfeeding mothers, general public, post-secondary institutions, and organizations providing services to breastfeeding mothers in Canada. OUTCOMES: This evidence-based e-resource facilitated addressing misconceptions around breastfeeding during COVID-19 and raising public awareness on safe infant feeding practices during this pandemic. Overall, the video was described as an informative, user-friendly, useful, and easily accessible resource by breastfeeding mothers who were in self-isolation with little access to healthcare services during the pandemic. IMPLICATIONS: This project highlighted the importance of patient engagement and collaboration with the community partner in protecting breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic. It further illustrated how informational e-resources can protect breastfeeding in situations where breastfeeding mothers' access to healthcare services is compromised.","Hirani, Shela Akbar Ali; Pearce, Megan; Lanoway, Amanda",Can J Public Health,,424

While previous research has mostly focused on the""number of mentions""of scientific research on social media, the current study applies""topic networks""to measure public attention to scientific research on Twitter. Topic networks are the networks of co-occurring author keywords in scholarly publications and networks of co-occurring hashtags in the tweets mentioning those scholarly publications. This study investigates which topics in opioid scholarly publications have received public attention on Twitter. Additionally, it investigates whether the topic networks generated from the publications tweeted by all accounts (bot and non-bot accounts) differ from those generated by non-bot accounts. Our analysis is based on a set of opioid scholarly publications from 2011 to 2019 and the tweets associated with them. We use co-occurrence network analysis to generate topic networks. Results indicated that Twitter users have mostly used generic terms to discuss opioid publications, such as""Opioid,""""Pain,""""Addiction,""""Treatment,""""Analgesics,""""Abuse,""""Overdose,""and""Disorders.""Results confirm that topic networks provide a legitimate method to visualize public discussions of health-related scholarly publications and how Twitter users discuss health-related scientific research differently from the scientific community. There was a substantial overlap between the topic networks based on the tweets by all accounts and non-bot accounts. This result indicates that it might not be necessary to exclude bot accounts for generating topic networks as they have a negligible impact on the results.","Haunschild, Robin; Bornmann, Lutz; Potnis, Devendra; Tahamtan, Iman",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11483v2.pdf,424

This study aimed to summarize the blood biochemistry characteristics of COVID-19 patients by performing a systemic review and meta-analysis of published studies. Methods Comprehensive studies were screened from PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library through March 11, 2020. The inclusion criteria included studies investigating the biochemical indexes of patients with COVID-19. The statistical software R3.6.3 was used for meta-analysis. Results Ten studies including 1745 COVID-19 patients met the inclusion criteria for our meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that 16% and 20% of patients with COVID-19 had alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels higher than the normal range, respectively. Thirty-four percent of patients showed albumin (ALB) levels lower than the normal range, and 6% of patients showed abnormal total bilirubin (TBil) levels. The levels of creatinine (CRE) were increased in 8% of patients. The creatine kinase (CK) level of 13% of patients exceeded the normal range, and 52% of patients had elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. In addition, six studies met the inclusion criteria for the systemic review evaluating the relevance between LDH levels and the severity of COVID-19, and all six studies showed a positive association between these two factors. Conclusions Some patients with COVID-19 had different degrees of blood biochemical abnormalities, which might indicate multiple organ dysfunction. Some biochemical indexes, such as abnormal ALB and LDH, could reflect the severity of the disease to a certain extent. These blood biochemical indicators should be considered in the clinical management of the disease.","Deng, Xiaoling; Liu, Beibei; Li, Jiahuan; Zhang, Junli; Zhao, Yajuan; Xu, Keshu",Clin. chem. lab. med,,424

METHODS: A U.S. nationwide sample of 430 adults (49.8% women; mean age = 40.72) completed a prospective online study, including an initial assessment (between March 27 and April 5, 2020), a 1 month follow-up (between April 27 and May 21, 2020), and a 3 month follow-up (between June 26 and July 15, 2020). We hypothesized that greater pseudoscientific and just world beliefs, lower governmental, institutional, and dispositional trust, and Republican Party affiliation would be associated with lower initial adherence to social distancing and greater reductions in social distancing over time and that COVID-19 risk perceptions would account for significant variance in these relations. RESULTS: Results revealed unique associations of lower governmental trust, greater COVID-19 pseudoscientific beliefs, and greater trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to lower initial adherence to social distancing. Whereas greater COVID-19 risk perceptions and CDC trust were associated with less steep declines in social distancing over time, both Republican (vs. Democratic) Party affiliation and greater COVID-19 pseudoscientific beliefs were associated with steeper declines in social distancing over time (relations accounted for by lower COVID-19 risk perceptions). CONCLUSIONS: Results highlight the utility of public health interventions aimed at improving scientific literacy and emphasizing bipartisan support for social distancing guidelines.","Gratz, Kim L; Richmond, Julia R; Woods, Sherry E; Dixon-Gordon, Katherine L; Scamaldo, Kayla M; Rose, Jason P; Tull, Matthew T",Ann Behav Med,,424
325609,Teachers' Views towards the Effects of COVID-19 Pandemic in the Education Process in Turkey,2021,"A variety of antiviral treatments for COVID-19 have been investigated, involving many repurposed drugs. Currently, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, encoded by nsp12-nsp7-nsp8) has been targeted by numerous inhibitors, e.g., remdesivir, the only provisionally approved treatment to-date, although the clinical impact of these interventions remains inconclusive. However, the potential emergence of antiviral resistance poses a threat to the efficacy of any successful therapies on a wide scale. Here, we propose a framework to monitor the emergence of antiviral resistance, and as a proof of concept, we address the interaction between RdRp and remdesivir. We show that SARS-CoV-2 RdRp is under purifying selection, that potential escape mutations are rare in circulating lineages, and that those mutations, where present, do not destabilise RdRp. In more than 56,000 viral genomes from 105 countries from the first pandemic wave, we found negative selective pressure affecting nsp12 (Tajima’s D = −2.62), with potential antiviral escape mutations in only 0.3% of sequenced genomes. Potential escape mutations included known key residues, such as Nsp12:Val473 and Nsp12:Arg555. Of the potential escape mutations involved globally, in silico structural models found that they were unlikely to be associated with loss of stability in RdRp. No potential escape mutation was found in a local cohort of remdesivir treated patients. Collectively, these findings indicate that RdRp is a suitable drug target, and that remdesivir does not seem to exert high selective pressure. We anticipate our framework to be the starting point of a larger effort for a global monitoring of drug resistance throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.","Mari, Alfredo Roloff Tim Stange Madlen Søgaard Kirstine K.; Asllanaj, Erblin Tauriello Gerardo Alexander Leila Tamara Schweitzer Michael Leuzinger Karoline Gensch Alexander Martinez Aurélien E.; Bielicki, Julia Pargger Hans Siegemund Martin Nickel Christian H.; Bingisser, Roland Osthoff Michael Bassetti Stefano Sendi Parham Battegay Manuel Marzolini Catia Seth-Smith Helena M.

326616,COVID-19 in a collectivist culture: social isolation and maintenance of social relations,2020,"SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses to the Spike (S) protein monomer, S protein native trimeric form or the nucleocapsid (N) proteins were evaluated in cohorts of individuals with acute infection (n=93) and in individuals enrolled in a post-infection seroprevalence population study (n=578) in Switzerland. Commercial assays specific for the S1 monomer, for the N protein and a newly developed Luminex assay using the S protein trimer were found to be equally sensitive in antibody detection in the acute infection phase samples. Interestingly, as compared to anti-S antibody responses, those against the N protein appear to wane in the post-infection cohort. Seroprevalence in a 'positive patient contacts' group (n=177) was underestimated by N protein assays by 10.9 to 32.2% and the 'random selected' general population group (n=311) was reduced up to 45% reduction relative to S protein assays. The overall reduction in seroprevalence targeting only anti-N antibodies for the total cohort ranged from 9.4 to 31%. Of note, the use of the S protein in its native trimer form was significantly more sensitive as compared to monomeric S proteins. These results indicate that the assessment of anti-S IgG antibody responses against the native trimeric S protein should be implemented to estimate SARS-CoV-2 infections in population-based seroprevalence studies.IMPORTANCE In the present study, we have determined SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses in sera of acute and post-infection phase subjects. Our results indicate that antibody responses against viral S and N proteins were equally sensitive in the acute phase of infection but that responses against N appear to wane in the post-infection phase while those against S protein persist over time. The most sensitive serological assay in both acute and post-infection phases used the native S protein trimer as binding antigen that has significantly greater conformational epitopes for antibody binding compared to the S1 monomer protein used in other assays. We believe that these results are extremely important in order to generate correct estimates of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the general population. Furthermore, the assessment of antibody responses against the trimeric S protein will be critical to evaluate the durability of the antibody response and for the characterization of a vaccine-induced antibody response.","Fenwick, Craig; Croxatto, Antony; Coste, Alix T; Pojer, Florence; André, Cyril; Pellaton, Céline; Farina, Alex; Campos, Jérémy; Hacker, David; Lau, Kelvin; Bosch, Berend-Jan; Gonseth Nussle, Semira; Bochud, Murielle; D039,; Acremont, Valerie; Trono, Didier; Greub, Gilbert; Pantaleo, Giuseppe",J. virol,,424

This pandemic continues to cause widespread personal suffering, along with severe pressure on medical and health care providers. The symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent prognosis are worsened in individuals who have preexisting comorbidities prior to infection by the virus. Individuals with obesity or overweight, insulin resistance, and diabetes typically have chronic low-grade inflammation characterized by increased levels of several proinflammatory cytokines and the inflammasome; this state predisposes to greater risk for infection along with more adverse outcomes. Here, we consider whether a high level of cardiorespiratory fitness induced by prior exercise training may confer some innate immune protection against COVID-19 by attenuating the ""cytokine storm syndrome"" often experienced by ""at risk"" individuals.","Zbinden-Foncea, Hermann; Francaux, Marc; Deldicque, Louise; Hawley, John A",Obesity (Silver Spring),,424

Travellers are likely to adapt their behaviour to avoid the risk of transmission and these changes may even be sustained after the pandemic. To evaluate travellers' behaviour in public transport networks during these times and assess how they will respond to future changes in the pandemic, we conduct a stated choice experiment with train travellers in the Netherlands. We specifically assess behaviour related to three criteria affecting the risk of COVID-19 transmission: (i) crowding, (ii) exposure duration, and (iii) prevalent infection rate. Observed choices are analysed using a latent class choice model which reveals two, nearly equally sized traveller segments: 'COVID Conscious' and 'Infection Indifferent'. The former has a significantly higher valuation of crowding, accepting, on average 8.75 minutes extra waiting time to reduce one person on-board. Moreover, they demonstrate a strong desire to sit without anybody in their neighbouring seat and are quite sensitive to changes in the prevalent infection rate. By contrast, Infection Indifferent travellers' value of crowding (1.04 waiting time minutes/person) is only slightly higher than pre-pandemic estimates and they are relatively unaffected by infection rates. We find that older and female travellers are more likely to be COVD Conscious while those reporting to use the trains more frequently during the pandemic tend to be Infection Indifferent. Further analysis also reveals differences between the two segments in attitudes towards the pandemic and self-reported rule-following behaviour. The behavioural insights from this study will not only contribute to better demand forecasting for service planning but will also inform public transport policy decisions aimed at curbing the shift to private modes.","Shelat, Sanmay; Cats, Oded; Cranenburgh, Sander van",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.10973v1.pdf,424

This had an immediate major effect on the job market, with millions of Americans forced to find alternative ways to make a living from home. As online labor markets like Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) play a major role in social science research, concerns have been raised that the pandemic may be reducing the diversity of subjects participating in experiments. Here, we investigate this possibility empirically. Specifically, we look at 15,539 responses gathered in 23 studies run on MTurk between February and July 2020, examining the distribution of gender, age, ethnicity, political preference, and analytic cognitive style. We find notable changes on some of the measures following the imposition of nationwide social distancing: participants are more likely to be less reflective (as measured by the Cognitive Reflection Test), and somewhat less likely to be white, Democrats (traditionally over-represented on MTurk), and experienced with MTurk. Most of these differences are explained by an influx of new participants into the MTurk subject pool who are more diverse and representative - but also less attentive - than previous MTurkers.","Arechar, Antonio A; Rand, David G",Behav. res. meth,,424

SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgM antibodies were detected in her cerebrospinal fluid with features of encephalitis evident in both magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and electroencephalogram. She made a complete recovery following treatment with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulins. Diagnosis of COVID-19 postinfectious encephalitis may prove challenging in patients presenting many weeks following the initial infection. A high index of clinical suspicion and testing intrathecal SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies are key to its diagnosis. Early immunotherapy is likely to result in a good outcome.","Gunawardhana, Champika; Nanayakkara, Geetha; Gamage, Dhanusha; Withanage, Indika; Bandara, Manjeewa; Siriwimala, Chandima; Senaratne, Nipun; Chang, Thashi",Neurol. sci,,424

We aimed to assess the prevalence, spectrum, severity, and significance of digestive manifestations in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. METHODS: Consecutive patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were identified across a geographically diverse alliance of medical centers in North America. Data pertaining to baseline characteristics, symptomatology, laboratory assessment, imaging, and endoscopic findings from the time of symptom onset until discharge or death were manually abstracted from electronic health records to characterize the prevalence, spectrum, and severity of digestive manifestations. Regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between digestive manifestations and severe outcomes related to COVID-19. FINDINGS: A total of 1992 patients across 36 centers met eligibility criteria and were included. Overall, 53% of patients experienced at least one gastrointestinal symptom at any time during their illness, most commonly diarrhea (34%), nausea (27%), vomiting (16%), and abdominal pain (11%). In 74% of cases, gastrointestinal symptoms were judged to be mild. In total, 35% of patients developed an abnormal alanine aminotransferase or total bilirubin level; these were elevated to less than 5 times the upper limit of normal in 77% of cases. After adjusting for potential confounders, the presence of gastrointestinal symptoms at any time (odds ratio 0.93, 95% confidence interval 0.76-1.15) or liver test abnormalities on admission (odds ratio 1.31, 95% confidence interval 0.80-2.12) were not independently associated with mechanical ventilation or death. CONCLUSION: Among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, gastrointestinal symptoms and liver test abnormalities were common but the majority were mild and their presence was not associated with a more severe clinical course.","Elmunzer, B Joseph; Spitzer, Rebecca L; Foster, Lydia D; Merchant, Ambreen A; Howard, Eric F; Patel, Vaishali A; West, Mary K; Qayed, Emad; Nustas, Rosemary; Zakaria, Ali; Piper, Marc S; Taylor, Jason R; Jaza, Lujain; Forbes, Nauzer; Chau, Millie; Lara, Luis F; Papachristou, Georgios I; Volk, Michael L; Hilson, Liam G; Zhou, Selena; Kushnir, Vladimir M; Lenyo, Alexandria M; McLeod, Caroline G; Amin, Sunil; Kuftinec, Gabriela N; Yadav, Dhiraj; Fox, Charlie; Kolb, Jennifer M; Pawa, Swati; Pawa, Rishi; Canakis, Andrew; Huang, Christopher; Jamil, Laith H; Aneese, Andrew M; Glamour, Benita K; Smith, Zachary L; Hanley, Katherine A; Wood, Jordan; Patel, Harsh K; Shah, Janak N; Agarunov, Emil; Sethi, Amrita; Fogel, Evan L; McNulty, Gail; Haseeb, Abdul; Trieu, Judy A; Dixon, Rebekah E; Yang, Jeong Yun; Mendelsohn, Robin B; Calo, Delia",Clin. gastroenterol. hepatol,,424

We review different biomarkers to evaluate if they are able to predict clinical outcomes and correlate with the severity of COVID-19 disease. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was carried out to identify relevant articles using six different databases. Keywords to refine the search included 'COVID-19', 'SARS-CoV2', 'Biomarkers', among others. Only studies which reported data on pre-defined outcomes were included. KEY FINDINGS: Thirty-four relevant articles were identified which reviewed the following biomarkers: C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, interleukin-6, lactate dehydrogenase, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, D-dimer, cardiac troponin, renal biomarkers, lymphocytes and platelet count. Of these, all but two, showed significantly higher levels in patients with severe complications of COVID-19 infection compared to their non-severe counterparts. Lymphocytes and platelet count showed significantly lower levels in severe patients compared to non-severe patients. SIGNIFICANCE: Although research is still in its early stages, the discovery of how different biomarkers behave during the course of the disease could help clinicians in identifying severe disease earlier and subsequently improve prognosis. Nevertheless, we urge for more research across the globe to corroborate these findings.","Kermali, Muhammed; Khalsa, Raveena Kaur; Pillai, Kiran; Ismail, Zahra; Harky, Amer",Life Sci,,424

At the beginning of March, 2020 in Northern Italy a complete lockdown of activities was imposed. Access to all healthcare providers, was halted for patients with elective problems. We present the management experience of the Humanitas Clinical and Research Center Ophthalmology Department in Rozzano, Milan, Italy, during the lockdown. METHODS: Containment measures were taken to reduce viral transmission and identify infected patients. All planned visits were canceled but for those not deferrable. Social distancing was introduced reducing number of visits per hour. Minor surgery for progressive pathologies was continued. As the lockdown prolonged, we reorganized patient care. All canceled cases were evaluated by electronic medical records analysis and telephonic triage, to identify, recall, and visit patients at risk of vision loss. RESULTS: From March 9, to April 30, 2020 we performed a total of 930 visits and 612 exams. Some visits (n = 698) and exams (n = 160) were deemed as necessary for continuity of care and performed as planned. Among the remaining 1283 canceled appointments, after evaluation 144 visits and 32 instrumental exams were classified as urgent and rapidly rescheduled. Performed surgical activities were limited to corneal collagen cross linking (n = 39) and intravitreal injections (n = 91), compared to 34 and 94, respectively, in the same period of 2019. CONCLUSION: In-office activities deemed not deferrable were performed safely. The recall service was highly appreciated by all patients. No patient or staff member reported symptoms of COVID-19.","Legrottaglie, Emanuela Filomena; Balia, Laura; Camesasca, Fabrizio Ivo; Vallejo-Garcia, Jose Luis; Fossati, Giovanni; Vinciguerra, Riccardo; Rosetta, Pietro; Vinciguerra, Paolo",Eur J Ophthalmol,,424

For the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein evaluations, the state reporting office supports the public health departments by providing daily and weekly evaluations and supports the transmission of notification data to the Robert Koch Institute according to the Infection Protection Act.In the present report of the state notification office of Schleswig-Holstein, the SARS-CoV­2 reporting data for the period from March to September 2020 are evaluated. Based on the development of the infection numbers, this period was divided into two phases of similar size: March to May and June to September. A total of 4898 infection cases were reported. Upon comparison of the phases, there were particularly marked differences in hospitalization and mortality, age, and countries of infection site. In the first phase, elderly persons were particularly affected by high rates of hospitalization and mortality. In the second phase, the average age and hospitalization and mortality rates were significantly lower, and a particularly large proportion were associated with international travel activity. The evaluation of the outbreak documentation revealed a particular focus in private household settings. This article describes the epidemic situation in a low-incidence state within the Federal Republic of Germany.","Rose, Ruben; Scherer, Damian; Maschkowitz, Gregor; Läubrich, Christoph; Fickenscher, Helmut",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,,424

339766,"COVID-19, Democracies, and (De)Colonialities",2020,"The spread of the COVID-19 virus has resulted in unprecedented measures restricting travel and activity participation in many countries. Social distancing, i.e., reducing interactions between individuals in order to slow down the spread of the virus, has become the new norm. In this viewpoint I will discuss the potential implications of social distancing on daily travel patterns. Avoiding social contact might completely change the number and types of out-of-home activities people perform, and how people reach these activities. It can be expected that the demand for travel will reduce and that people will travel less by public transport. Social distancing might negatively affect subjective well-being and health status, as it might result in social isolation and limited physical activity. As a result, walking and cycling, recreationally or utilitarian, can be important ways to maintain satisfactory levels of health and well-being. Policymakers and planners should consequently try to encourage active travel, while public transport operators should focus on creating ways to safely use public transport.","De Vos, Jonas",Transp.

Data were collected by an observer, through field notes, and were analyzed with content analysis. A face scale was used to assess PwD's mood. Thirteen PwD were observed for 90 hours. Four thematic areas were identified: (a) Unmet Fundamental Patient Needs, (b) Human Right to Dignity and Respect, (c) Communication Deficiencies, and (d) Implementation of Nursing Interventions. Nurse-patient contact lasted from 5 to 7 minutes and numerous care omissions were noted. The face scale assessment revealed that most PwD looked very sad after nursing care.

339952,Smartphone-assisted experimentation as a didactic strategy to maintain practical lessons in remote education: alternatives for physiology education during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: Peanut is an important legume crop growing worldwide. With the published allotetraploid genomes, further functional studies of the genes in peanut are very critical for crop improvement. CRISPR/Cas9 system is emerging as a robust tool for gene functional study and crop improvement, which haven't been extensively utilized in peanut yet. Peanut plant forms root nodules to fix nitrogen through a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia. In model legumes, the response of plants to rhizobia is initiated by Nod factor receptors (NFRs). However, information about the function of NFRs in peanut is still limited. In this study, we applied the CRISPR/Cas9 tool in peanut hairy root transformation system to explore the function of NFR genes. RESULTS: We firstly identified four AhNFR1 genes and two AhNFR5 genes in cultivated peanut (Tifrunner). The gene expression analysis showed that the two AhNFR1 and two AhNFR5 genes had high expression levels in nodulating (Nod+) line E5 compared with non-nodulating (Nod-) line E4 during the process of nodule formation, suggesting their roles in peanut nodulation. To further explore their functions in peanut nodulation, we applied CRISPR technology to create knock-out mutants of AhNFR1 and AhNFR5 genes using hairy root transformation system. The sequencing of these genes in transgenic hairy roots showed that the selected AhNFR1 and AhNFR5 genes were successfully edited by the CRISPR system, demonstrating its efficacy for targeted mutation in allotetraploid peanut. The mutants with editing in the two AhNFR5 genes showed Nod- phenotype, whereas mutants with editing in the two selected AhNFR1 genes could still form nodules after rhizobia inoculation. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that CRISPR-Cas9 could be used in peanut hairy root transformation system for peanut functional genomic studies, specifically on the gene function in roots. By using CRISPR-Cas9 targeting peanut AhNFR genes in hairy root transformation system, we validated the function of AhNFR5 genes in nodule formation in peanut.","Shu, Hongmei; Luo, Ziliang; Peng, Ze; Wang, Jianping",BMC Plant Biol,,424

METHODS: Fifty-two cases of COVID-19 were admitted in the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine. The consecutive chest CT scans were followed up for all patients with an average of 4 scans performed per patient during the hospitalization. The shortest interval between each scan was 2 days and the longest was 7 days. The shape, number and distribution of lung shadows, as well as the characteristics of the lesions on the CT images were reviewed. RESULTS: The obvious shadows infiltrating the lungs were shown on CT images in 50 cases, for other 2 cases there was no abnormal changes in the lungs during the first CT examination. Ground-glass opacities (GGO) were found in 48 cases (92.3%), and 19 cases (36.5%) had patchy consolidation and sub-consolidation, which were accompanied with air bronchi sign in 17 cases (32.7%). Forty one cases (78.8%) showed a thickened leaflet interval, 4 cases (7.6%) had a small number of fibrous stripes. During hospitalization, GGO lesions in COVID-19 patients gradually became rare,the fibrous strip shadows increased and it became the most common imaging manifestation. The lesions rapidly progressed in 39 cases (75.0%) within 6-9 days after admission. On days 10-14 of admission, the lesions distinctly resolved in 40 cases (76.9%). CONCLUSIONS: The chest CT images of patients with COVID-19 have certain characteristics with dynamic changes, which are of value for monitoring disease progress and clinical treatment.","Wang, Jincheng; Liu, Jinpeng; Wang, Yuanyuan; Liu, Wei; Chen, Xiaoqun; Sun, Chao; Shen, Xiaoyong; Wang, Qidong; Wu, Yaping; Liang, Wenjie; Ruan, Lingxiang",Zhejiang Da Xue Xue Bao Yi Xue Ban,,424

It is found that social awareness can effectively contain the spread by lowering the basic reproduction rate R 0 . Interestingly, the awareness is found to be more effective in a society which can adopt the awareness faster compared to the one having a slower response. The paper also separates the mortality fraction from the clinically recovered fraction and attempts to model the outcome of lockdowns, in absence and presence of social awareness. It is seen that staggered exits from lockdowns are not only economically beneficial but also helps to curb the infection spread. Moreover, a staggered exit strategy with progressive social awareness is found to be the most efficient intervention. The paper also explores the effects of anthropogenic migration on the dynamics of the epidemic in a two-zone scenario. The calculations yield dissimilar evolution of different fractions in different zones. Such models can be convenient to strategize the division of a large zone into smaller sub-zones for a disproportionate imposition of lockdown, or, an exit from one. Calculations are done with parameters consistent with the SARS-COV-2 pathogen in the Indian context.","Bhattacharyya, R; Konar, Partha",Int J Dyn Control,,424

During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown period in Germany, less patients presented at emergency departments and private practices. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the DKA risk in children and adolescents with DM1 manifestation during the COVID-19 lockdown and associated risk factors. Material and methods: The frequency of DKA at DM1 onset in patients <18 years between 13 March and 13 May 2020 in pediatric diabetes centers was analyzed. The centers also documented their assessment, if the presentation was delayed or the diagnosis was not made on the first medical consultation. In order to analyze the influence of the risk factors on the frequency of DKA, the data from 2020 were compared with the same periods in 2018 and 2019 using multivariable linear and logistic regression. Results: The data of 532 patients from 216 diabetes centers showed that the risk for DKA increased by 84.7% and the risk for severe DKA increased by 45.3% compared to the years 2018/2019. Children <6 years had the highest risk with an 141.6% increase for DKA and 97.0% for severe DKA compared to the previous years. Migration background was a risk factor independent of COVID-19. Of the patients 31% had either a delayed presentation or a missed diagnosis. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 lockdown the frequency of DKA and severe DKA at DM1 onset was significantly increased for children and adolescents in Germany. Age <6 years, migration background and delayed diagnosis were the main risk factors.","Mönkemöller, Kirsten; Kamrath, Clemens; Hammersen, Johanna; Biester, Torben; Warncke, Katharina; Pappa, Angeliki; Fink, Katharina; Raile, Klemens; Rohrer, Tilman R; Holl, Reinhard W",Monatsschr Kinderheilkd,,424

Worldwide many countries implemented quarantine policies to minimize the spread of this highly contagious disease. The present study aim was to investigate the impact of quarantine on the medical students’ mental wellbeing and learning behaviors. Methods: In this descriptive study, we used a questionnaire with a Five-Point Likert Scale to collect the information. The questionnaire was distributed among 625 medical students through their emails with a response rate of 530 (84.8%), majority 294 (55.47%) being female. The survey questionnaire consisted of total 20 items; 12 items were related to psychological wellbeing and stress-allied queries and 08 items were about learning behaviors. Results: The findings encompass two important characteristics related to quarantine, psychological wellbeing, and learning behaviors. A combined cohort of 234 medical students, either female or male, (which was 44.1% of the total responders) showed a sense of being emotionally detached from family, friends and fellow students, 125/ 530 (23.5%) medical students felt disheartened. Both female and male medical students showed a marked decrease in their overall work performance. Moreover, 56.2% of the total students (61.5% of the females and 49.5% of the males) felt a decrease in the time they spent studying. Conclusions: Both female and male medical students have identified that quarantine has caused them to feel emotionally detached from family, fellows, and friends and decrease their overall work performance and study period. The findings also show that one-fourth of the medical students who participated in this study felt disheartened during the quarantine period. The long-term quarantine due to COVID-19 pandemic may causes further worsening in the psychological and learning behaviors of these medical students.","Meo, Sultan Ayoub; Abukhalaf, Abdulelah Adnan; Alomar, Ali Abdullah; Sattar, Kamran; Klonoff, David C.",Pak.

METHODS: The research is planned in a descriptive type. Nurses and midwives working in any health institution in Turkey constituted the population of the research. The questionnaire form of the study was shared on social media tools between 01 and 14 April 2020 and a total of 758 nurses and midwives were included in the study sample. Personal Information Form, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale were used as data collection tools. RESULTS: Participants who attended the study were 56.9% of nurses and 43.1% of midwives. Approximately half of the nurses and midwives (48.8%) participating in our study contacted the patient with suspected COVID-19, and 29.8% provided care to the patient diagnosed with COVID-19. Nurses and midwives were scored 52.75 ± 9.80 for State Anxiety, 44.87 ± 7.92 for Trait Anxiety Inventory and 35.16 ± 9.42 for Intolerance of Uncertainty Scale. It has been determined that 54.5% of nurses and midwives have been making their lives worse since the outbreak started, 62.4% had difficulties in dealing with the uncertain situation in the outbreak, 42.6% wanted psychological support and 11.8% had alienated from their profession. It was determined that there was a difference between scale scores and difficulties in work, family and private life due to COVID-19. CONCLUSION: As a result, it is seen that the midwives and nurses in our country have high psychological effects due to the COVID-19 outbreak.","Aksoy, Yasemin Erkal; Koçak, Vesile",Arch Psychiatr Nurs,,424
344311,The COVID-19 pandemic and agricultural education: An exploration of challenges faced by teachers,2021,"Collaboration in emergency logistics can be beneficial for governmental actors when supply chains need to be set up immediately. In comparison to research on humanitarian-business partnerships, the body of literature on so-called Public–Private Emergency Collaborations (PPEC) remains scarce. Private companies are only rarely considered within research on emergency collaborations, although they serve as an important chain in the efficient supply of goods given their resources and existing communication networks. Based on this research gap, we contribute to the research field by quantitatively evaluating public–private collaboration in emergency logistics. A framework for public–private emergency collaborations is developed based on logistical and game-theoretical concepts. In addition, we characterize both public and private actors’ possible roles in emergency logistics based on literature research and real cases. Furthermore, we provide a structured overview on existing PPECs and the challenges they are confronted with. The game-theoretic PPEC model created in this paper provides more detailed information into the motivation and incentives of the partners involved in emergency collaborations. Inspired by game-theoretic accounts of conventional public–private partnerships, this model sheds light on the partners’ participation constraints (which define the scope of collaboration), the effects on the outcome if the partners’ contributions are strategic substitutes, and on reputational effects. Finally, we illustrate how a mechanism design approach can be used by the state to transform the firm’s incentives into lower levels of undersupply or deprivation.","Diehlmann, Florian Lüttenberg Markus Verdonck Lotte Wiens Marcus Zienau Alexander Schultmann Frank",Safety Science,,424
344436,Book Review: Reimagining Global Abortion Politics: A Social Justice Perspective,2020,"BACKGROUND: We previously summarized outcomes for 46 cladribine tablets (CladT)-treated patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and confirmed or suspected COVID-19, as reported to the Merck KGaA Global Patient Safety Database. This report updates on these findings, to 15 January 2021, for a total of 272 reported cases of COVID-19 among CladT recipients. METHODS: Case definitions: confirmed (COVID-19 diagnostic test was positive); suspected (no confirmatory test performed/reported). Cases fulfilling the criteria of hospitalized, medically significant, or fatal were designated as serious and outcomes were classified per usual pharmacovigilance practice. RESULTS: The evaluable cohort comprised 261 patients (confirmed COVID-19, n=160; suspected, n=101); an additional 11 patients had symptoms compatible with COVID-19 but were not evaluated further given their negative diagnostic tests. Median time to onset of COVID-19 from the most recent preceding CladT treatment course was 162 days (n=139). Outcomes were: recovered/recovering, n=133 (51%); not recovered/not resolved, n=19 (7%); died, n=1 (0.4%); and not reported/missing/pending, n=108 (41%). Of the total cohort, 40 (15%) experienced serious COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that CladT-treated patients with MS are generally not at greater risk of serious disease and/or a severe outcome with COVID-19 compared with the general population and other patients with MS who acquired COVID-19.","Jack, Dominic; Damian, Doris; Nolting, Axel; Galazka, Andrew",Mult Scler Relat Disord,,424

Since the start of the outbreak, the importance of hand-hygiene and respiratory protection to prevent the spread of the virus has been the prime focus for infection control. Health regulatory organisations have produced guidelines for the formulation of hand sanitisers to the manufacturing industries. This review summarises the studies on alcohol-based hand sanitisers and their disinfectant activity against SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses. The literature shows that the type and concentration of alcohol, formulation and nature of product, presence of excipients, applied volume, contact time and viral contamination load are critical factors that determine the effectiveness of hand sanitisers.","Singh, D; Joshi, K; Samuel, A; Patra, J; Mahindroo, N",Epidemiol Infect,,424

The objectives of the study were: (i) to compare training and recovery conditions before and during the isolation period in handball players according to gender and competitive level, and (ii) to analyse the impact of psychological factors during the isolation period. A total of 187 participants (66 women and 121 men) answered a Google Forms questionnaire about demographics, training, moods, emotional intelligence, and resilience sent using the snowball sampling technique. T-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to compare sport level and gender differences. Linear regressions were used to analyse the psychological influence on training. Handball players reduced training intensity (in the whole sample; p = 0.44), training volume (especially in professional female handball players; p < 0.001), and sleep quality (especially in professional male handball players; p = 0.21) and increased sleep hours (especially in non-professional female players; p = 0.006) during the isolation period. Furthermore, psychological factors affected all evaluated training and recovery conditions during the quarantine, except for sleep quantity. Mood, emotional intelligence, and resilience have an influence on physical activity levels and recovery conditions. In addition, training components were modified under isolation conditions at p < 0.001. We conclude that the COVID-19 isolation period caused reductions in training volume and intensity and decreased sleep quality. Furthermore, psychological components have a significant impact on training and recovery conditions.","Mon-López, Daniel; de la Rubia Riaza, Alfonso; Hontoria Galán, Mónica; Refoyo Roman, Ignacio",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,424
347309,"Non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies for outbreak of COVID-19 in Hangzhou, China",2020,"Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to almost every region and country in the world, leading to widespread travel restrictions and national lockdowns. Currently, there are limited epidemiological and clinical data on COVID-19 patients from low and middle-income countries. We conducted a retrospective single-center study of the first 100 individuals with suspected COVID-19 (between Jan. 25 and Mar. 29, 2020) admitted to San Lazaro Hospital (SLH), the national infectious diseases referral hospital in Manila, Philippines. Results: Demographic data, travel history, clinical features, and outcomes were summarized and compared between COVID-19 confirmed and non-confirmed cases. The first two confirmed cases were Chinese nationals, admitted on Jan. 25. The third confirmed case was a Filipino, admitted on Mar. 8. Trends toward confirmed COVID-19 cases not reporting international travel and being admitted to SLH from the densely populated area of Manila city were observed during Mar. 8-29. All 42 of the 100 confirmed COVID-19 cases were adults, 40% were aged 60 years and above and 55% were male. Three were health workers. Among individuals with suspected COVID-19, confirmed cases were more likely to be older, Filipino, not report international travel history and have at least one underlying disease, particularly diabetes, report difficulty in breathing, and a longer duration of symptoms. In over 90% of non-COVID-19 cases, the alternative diagnosis was respiratory. Nine (21%) confirmed cases died. The median duration from symptoms onset to death was 11.5 (range: 8-18) days. Conclusions: Imported COVID-19 cases have reduced but local transmission persists and there is a trend toward cases being admitted to SLH from densely populated areas. This study highlights the difficulty in diagnosing COVID-19 on clinical grounds and the importance of diagnostic capacity in all settings. Difficulty of breathing was the only symptom associated with COVID-19 infection and should alert clinicians to the possibility of COVID-19. Clinical characteristics of confirmed COVID-19 cases and a hospital case fatality rate of 21% are comparable with other settings.","Salva, Eumelia P.; Villarama, Jose Benito; Lopez, Edmundo B.; Sayo, Ana Ria; Villanueva, Annavi Marie G.; Edwards, Tansy; Han, Su Myat; Suzuki, Shuichi; Seposo, Xerxes; Ariyoshi, Koya; Smith, Chris",Trop.

METHODS: Daily number of deaths in all residential and nursing homes in England notified to the Care Quality Commission (CQC) from 1 January 2017 to 7 August 2020. Care home-level data linked with CQC care home register to identify home characteristics: client type (over 65s/children and adults), ownership status (for-profit/not-for-profit; branded/independent) and size (small/medium/large). Excess deaths computed as the difference between observed and predicted deaths using local authority fixed-effect Poisson regressions on pre-pandemic data. Fixed-effect logistic regressions were used to model odds of experiencing COVID-19 suspected/confirmed deaths. RESULTS: Up to 7 August 2020, there were 29,542 (95% CI 25,176 to 33,908) excess deaths in all care homes. Excess deaths represented 6.5% (95% CI 5.5 to 7.4%) of all care home beds, higher in nursing (8.4%) than residential (4.6%) homes. 64.7% (95% CI 56.4 to 76.0%) of the excess deaths were confirmed/suspected COVID-19. Almost all excess deaths were recorded in the quarter (27.4%) of homes with any COVID-19 fatalities. The odds of experiencing COVID-19 attributable deaths were higher in homes providing nursing services (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.6 to 2.0), to older people and/or with dementia (OR 5.5, 95% CI 4.4 to 6.8), amongst larger (vs. small) homes (OR 13.3, 95% CI 11.5 to 15.4) and belonging to a large provider/brand (OR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.3). There was no significant association with for-profit status of providers. CONCLUSIONS: To limit excess mortality, policy should be targeted at care homes to minimise the risk of ingress of disease and limit subsequent transmission. Our findings provide specific characteristic targets for further research on mechanisms and policy priority.","Morciano, Marcello; Stokes, Jonathan; Kontopantelis, Evangelos; Hall, Ian; Turner, Alex J",BMC Med,,424

However, existing contact tracing methods alone cannot provide sufficient coverage and do not successfully address privacy concerns of the participating entities. Current solutions do not utilize the huge volume of data stored in business databases and individual digital devices. This information is typically stored in data silos and cannot be used due to regulations in place. To successfully unlock the potential of contact tracing, we need to consider both data utilization from multiple sources and the privacy of the participating parties. To this end, we propose BeeTrace, a unified platform that breaks data silos and deploys state-of-the-art cryptographic protocols to guarantee privacy goals.","Liu, Xiaoyuan; Trieu, Ni; Kornaropoulos, Evgenios M.; Song, Dawn",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.02285v1.pdf,424

OBJETIVO: Descrever como os gestores de ILPIs de países hispano-americanos planejaram e adequaram suas rotinas de enfrentamento da COVID-19 e se foram capazes de cumprir as recomendações da Organização Mundial da Saúde (OMS). METODOLOGIA: Estudo transversal baseado na aplicação de uma pesquisa on-line dirigida aos gestores de ILPIs situadas em países hispano-americanos. Um questionário de 46 questões (adotando os princípios da OMS) foi enviado aos participantes. Estatística descritiva foi usada para resumir os dados. RESULTADOS: Vinte e três gestores responderam à pesquisa, totalizando 874 idosos (5 min - 270 máx); um questionário foi excluído por falta de respostas. Quatorze ILPIs (63,60%) eram privadas com fins lucrativos. A taxa de adesão às recomendações da OMS foi superior a 70% para a maioria das questões. Pouco mais da metade das instituições elaborou um plano estratégico de enfrentamento, ou identificou estratégias para lidar com óbitos de casos suspeitos. Dificuldade para a aquisição de equipamentos de proteção individual (EPIs) foi relatada por 59,10% das ILPIs investigadas. A capacidade de testagem para o SARS-Cov-2 foi reduzida (36,36% das instituições não dispunham de nenhum teste). CONCLUSÕES: A taxa de adesão às recomendações propostas pela OMS para o enfrentamento da COVID-19 foi superior a 70% para a maioria das ILPIs investigadas. Planos estratégicos de enfrentamento foram elaborados em pouco mais da metade das instituições.

354830,Invisible No More: The Impact of COVID-19 on Essential Food Production Workers,2020,"The COVID-19 lockdown has negatively affected individuals’ welfare. However, there has been no research published heretofore about the levels of self-concept (SC) in adolescents, nor how having practised martial arts (MA) or any physical activity (PA) before the lockdown may have influenced the SC in that time. Hence, this study aimed to analyze some demographic, physical, and psychosocial parameters in Spanish adolescents throughout the COVID-19 quarantine through a cross-sectional investigation, establishing correlations among these factors. Methods: The present study had a descriptive, comparative, and cross-sectional design. The sample comprised of 54 (39.7%) male and 82 (60.3%) female Spanish adolescents aged 12–18 (M = 14.49; SD = 1.80). An ad-hoc questionnaire collected sociodemographic data; the self-concept Form 5 (AF5) questionnaire obtained data on SC dimensions. Results: There were some differences among the SC dimensions, with family and academic dimensions having higher values than the physical and emotional ones. Females’ academic SC was higher than that of males (p = 0.019). The practice of PA before the lockdown was positively associated with physical (p &lt; 0.001) and social (p = 0.012) SC, yet there was no significant association between the previous practice of MA and SC (p &gt; 0.050). Conclusions: the findings suggest that the COVID-19 lockdown negatively affected Spanish adolescents by decreasing their total SC and some dimensions of it, although PA may buffer psychological harmfulness in adolescents.","Lindell-Postigo, David; Zurita-Ortega, Félix; Ortiz-Franco, Manuel; González-Valero, Gabriel",Educ.

We used analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical testing to determine whether there is any correlation between COVID-19 infection and mortality rates and lifestyles. We used ESRI Tapestry LifeModes data that are collected at the U.S. household level through geodemographic segmentation typically used for marketing purposes to identify consumers' lifestyles and preferences. According to the ANOVA analysis, a significant association between COVID-19 deaths and LifeModes emerged on 1 April 2020 and was sustained until 30 June 2020. Analysis of means (ANOM) was also performed to determine which LifeModes have incidence rates that are significantly above/below the overall mean incidence rate. We sequentially mapped and graphically illustrated when and where each LifeMode had above/below average risk for COVID-19 infection/death on specific dates. A strong northwest-to-south and northeast-to-south gradient of COVID-19 incidence was identified, facilitating an empirical classification of the United States into several epidemic subregions based on household lifestyle characteristics. Our approach correlating lifestyle characteristics to COVID-19 infection and mortality rate at the U.S. county level provided unique insights into where and when COVID-19 impacted different households. The results suggest that prevention and control policies can be implemented to those specific households exhibiting spatial and temporal pattern of high risk.","Ozdenerol, Esra; Seboly, Jacob",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,424
355951,Reply to Barthell et al,2020,"Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is closely associated with the development of gastric inflammatory diseases and cancer. However, the continued abuse and misuse of antibiotics has accelerated the spread of antibiotic-resistant strains, which poses a tremendous challenge for antibiotic-based H. pylori treatment. In this study, a H. pylori-targeting photodynamic therapy (PDT) system is proposed that multiple 3'-sialyllactose (3SL)-conjugated, poly-l-lysine-based photosensitizer (p3SLP). p3SLP facilitates H. pylori-targeting PDT via the specific interaction between 3SL and sialic acid-binding adhesin (SabA) in the H. pylori membrane. p3SLP can be orally administered to H. pylori infected mice and irradiated using an endoscopic laser system. The gastrointestinal pathological analysis of the H. pylori-infected mice demonstrated significant H. pylori specific antibacterial effects of PDT without side effects to normal tissue. In addition, an anti-inflammatory response was observed at the site of infection after p3SLP treatment. Consequently, this study demonstrates the superior efficacy of anti-H. pylori PDT with p3SLP in H. pylori-infected mice, and this approach shows great potential for replacing antibiotic-based therapy.","Im, Byeong Nam; Shin, Heejun; Lim, Byoungjun; Lee, Jonghwan; Kim, Kyoung Sub; Park, Jae Myeong; Na, Kun",Biomaterials,,424
356120,The impact of COVID-19 on pharmacy education: Perspectives of Nigerian undergraduate pharmacy students,2020,"BACKGROUND: By 2025, 5 million Canadians will be diagnosed with diabetes, and women from lower socioeconomic groups will likely account for most new diagnoses. Diabetic retinopathy is a primary vision complication of diabetes and a leading cause of blindness among adults, with 26% prevalence among women. Tele-retina is a branch of telemedicine that delivers eye care remotely. Screening for diabetic retinopathy has great potential to reduce the incidence of blindness, yet there is an adverse association among screening, income, and gender. OBJECTIVE: We aim to explore gender disparity in the provision of tele-retina program services for diabetic retinopathy screening in a cohort of women of low socioeconomic status (SES) receiving services in South Riverdale Community Health Centre (SRCHC) between 2014 and 2019. METHODS: Using a convergent mixed methods design, we want to understand patients', providers', administrators', and decision makers' perceptions of the facilitators and barriers associated with the implementation and adoption of tele-retina. Multivariate logistic regression will be utilized to assess the association among client characteristics, referral source, and diabetic retinopathy screening. Guided by a grounded theory approach, systematic coding of data and thematic analysis will be utilized to identify key facilitators and barriers to the implementation and adoption of tele-retina. RESULTS: For the quantitative component, we anticipate a cohort of 2500 patients, and we expect to collect data on the overall patterns of tele-retina program use, including descriptions of program utilization rates (such as data on received and completed diabetic retinopathy screening referrals) along the landscape of patient populations receiving these services. For the qualitative component, we plan to interview up to 21 patients and 14 providers, administrators, and decision makers, and to conduct up to 14 hours of observations alongside review of relevant documents. The interview guide is being developed in collaboration with our patient partners. Through the use of mixed methods research, the inquiry will be approached from different perspectives. Mixed methods will guide us in combining the rich subjective insights on complex realities from qualitative inquiry with the standard generalizable data that will be generated through quantitative research. The study is under review by the University Health Network Research Ethics Board (19-5628). We expect to begin recruitment in winter 2021. CONCLUSIONS: In Ontario, the screening rate for diabetic retinopathy among low income groups remains below 65%. Understanding the facilitators and barriers to diabetic retinopathy screening may be a prerequisite in the development of a successful screening program. This study is the first Ontario study to focus on diabetic retinopathy screening practices in women of low SES, with the aim to improve their health outcomes and revolutionize access to quality care.

Existing hematology analyzers require labor-intensive work and a panel of expensive reagents. Here we report an artificial-intelligence enabled reagent-free imaging hematology analyzer (AIRFIHA) modality that can accurately classify subpopulations of leukocytes with minimal sample preparation. AIRFIHA is realized through training a two-step residual neural network using label-free images of separated leukocytes acquired from a custom-built quantitative phase microscope. We validated the performance of AIRFIHA in randomly selected test set and cross-validated it across all blood donors. AIRFIHA outperforms current methods in classification accuracy, especially in B and T lymphocytes, while preserving the natural state of cells. It also shows a promising potential in differentiating CD4 and CD8 cells. Owing to its easy operation, low cost, and strong discerning capability of complex leukocyte subpopulations, we envision AIRFIHA is clinically translatable and can also be deployed in resource-limited settings, e.g., during pandemic situations for the rapid screening of infectious diseases.","Shu, Xin; Sansre, Sameera; Jin, Di; Zeng, Xiangxiang; Tong, Kai-Yu; Pandey, Rishikesh; Zhou, Renjie",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08518v1.pdf,424

Brazil demonstrates one of the highest numbers of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases, and São Paulo State is the epicenter of the pandemics in the country. Nevertheless, little is known about the SARS-CoV-2 circulation in other cities in the State than São Paulo city. The objective of this study was to analyze phylogenetically SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in city of Ribeirão Preto at the beginning of the pandemic and during the actual second wave. Twenty-nine nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive samples were sequenced by nanopore technology (18 obtained at the initial period of the pandemic and 11 during the second wave) and analyzed them phylogenetically. The performed analysis demonstrated that the majority of the strains obtained in the initial period of the pandemic in Ribeirão Preto belonged mainly to the B1.1.33 lineage (61.1%), but B.1.1 (27.8%) and B.1.1.28 (11.1%) lineages were also identified. In contrast, the second wave strains were composed exclusively by the Brazilian variant of concern (VOC) P.1 (91%) and P.2 (9%) lineages. The obtained phylogenetic results were suggestive of successive SARS-CoV-2 lineage substitution in this Brazilian region by the P.1 VOC. The performed study examines the SARS-CoV-2 genotypes in Ribeirão Preto city via genomic surveillance data.

The range of human cells and tissues targeted by SARS-CoV-2, its potential receptors and associated regulating factors are still largely unknown. The aim of our study was to analyze the expression of known and potential SARS-CoV-2 receptors and related molecules in the extensive collection of primary human cells and tissues from healthy subjects of different age and from patients with risk factors and known comorbidities of COVID-19. METHODS: We performed RNA sequencing and explored available RNA-Seq databases to study gene expression and co-expression of ACE2, CD147 (BSG), and CD26 (DPP4) and their direct and indirect molecular partners in primary human bronchial epithelial cells, bronchial and skin biopsies, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, whole blood, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), monocytes, neutrophils, DCs, NK cells, ILC1, ILC2, ILC3, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, B cells, and plasmablasts. We analyzed the material from healthy children and adults, and from adults in relation to their disease or COVID-19 risk factor status. RESULTS: ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were coexpressed at the epithelial sites of the lung and skin, whereas CD147 (BSG), cyclophilins (PPIA andPPIB), CD26 (DPP4), and related molecules were expressed in both epithelium and in immune cells. We also observed a distinct age-related expression profile of these genes in the PBMCs and T cells from healthy children and adults. Asthma, COPD, hypertension, smoking, obesity, and male gender status generally led to the higher expression of ACE2- and CD147-related genes in the bronchial biopsy, BAL, or blood. Additionally, CD147-related genes correlated positively with age and BMI. Interestingly, we also observed higher expression of CD147-related genes in the lesional skin of patients with atopic dermatitis. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest different receptor repertoire potentially involved in the SARS-CoV-2 infection at the epithelial barriers and in the immune cells. Altered expression of these receptors related to age, gender, obesity and smoking, as well as with the disease status, might contribute to COVID-19 morbidity and severity patterns.","Radzikowska, Urszula; Ding, Mei; Tan, Ge; Zhakparov, Damir; Peng, Yaqi; Wawrzyniak, Paulina; Wang, Ming; Li, Shuo; Morita, Hideaki; Altunbulakli, Can; Reiger, Matthias; Neumann, Avidan U; Lunjani, Nonhlanhla; Traidl-Hoffmann, Claudia; Nadeau, Kari C; O039,; Mahony, Liam; Akdis, Cezmi; Sokolowska, Milena",Allergy,,424

The present study aimed to analyze the characteristics of severe COVID-19 and identify biomarkers for differential diagnosis and prognosis prediction. In total, 27 consecutive patients with COVID-19 and 75 patients with flu were retrospectively enrolled. Clinical parameters were collected from electronic medical records. The disease course was divided into four stages: initial, progression, peak, and recovery stages, according to computed tomography (CT) progress. to mild COVID-19, the lymphocytes in the severe COVID-19 progressively decreased at the progression and the peak stages, but rebound in the recovery stage. The levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the severe group at the initial and progression stages were higher than those in the mild group. Correlation analysis showed that CRP (R = .62; P < .01), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (R = .55; P < .01) and granulocyte/lymphocyte ratio (R = .49; P < .01) were positively associated with the CT severity scores. In contrast, the number of lymphocytes (R = -.37; P < .01) was negatively correlated with the CT severity scores. The receiver-operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that area under the curve of CRP on the first visit for predicting severe COVID-19 was 0.87 (95% CI 0.10-1.00) at 20.42 mg/L cut-off, with sensitivity and specificity 83% and 91%, respectively. CRP in severe COVID-19 patients increased significantly at the initial stage, before CT findings. Importantly, CRP, which was associated with disease development, predicted early severe COVID-19.","Tan, Chaochao; Huang, Ying; Shi, Fengxia; Tan, Kui; Ma, Qionghui; Chen, Yong; Jiang, Xixin; Li, Xiaosong",J Med Virol,,424

To date, only remdesivir and dexamethasone have demonstrated a positive response in a prospective, randomized trial for the treatment of patients with COVID-19. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) is an agent available in an oral formulation with in vitro activity against SARS-CoV-2 that has been suggested as a potential agent. Unfortunately, results of randomized trials evaluating HCQ as treatment against a control group are lacking, and little is known about its pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profile against SARS-CoV-2. The objective of this review was to describe the current understanding of the PK/PD and dose selection of HCQ against SARS-CoV-2, discuss knowledge gaps, and identify future studies that are needed to optimize the efficacy and safety of treatments against COVID-19.","Morrisette, Taylor; Lodise, Thomas P; Scheetz, Marc H; Goswami, Srijib; Pogue, Jason M; Rybak, Michael J",Infect Dis Ther,,424

Three latitude-and-longitude-based indicators were employed to quantify the geographic distance of collaborations in AI over time at domestic and international levels. The results show team collaborations in AI has been more popular in the field over time with around 42,000 (38.4%) multiple-affiliation AI publications in 2019. The changes in geographic distances of team collaborations indicate the increase of breadth and density for both domestic and international collaborations in AI over time. In addition, the United States produced the largest number of single-country and internationally collaborated AI publications, and China has played an important role in international collaborations in AI after 2010.","Tang, Xuli; Li, Xin; Ding, Ying; Ma, Feicheng",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.13560v1.pdf,424
366253,An “Essential Services” Workforce for Crisis Response,2020,"Background: Social distancing measures may reduce the spread of emerging respiratory infections however, there is little empirical data on how exposure to crowded places affects risk of acute respiratory infection. Methods: We used a case-crossover design nested in a community cohort to compare self-reported measures of activities during the week before infection onset and baseline periods. The design eliminates the effect of non-time-varying confounders. Time-varying confounders were addressed by exclusion of illnesses around the Christmas period and seasonal adjustment. Results: 626 participants had paired data from the week before 1005 illnesses and the week before baseline. Each additional day of undertaking the following activities in the prior week was associated with illness onset: Spending more than five minutes in a room with someone (other than a household member) who has a cold (Seasonally adjusted OR 1.15, p=0.003); use of underground trains (1.31, p=0.036); use of supermarkets (1.32, p&lt;0.001); attending a theatre, cinema or concert (1.26, p=0.032); eating out at a café, restaurant or canteen (1.25, p=0.003); and attending parties (1.47, p&lt;0.001). Undertaking the following activities at least once in the previous week was associated with illness onset: using a bus, (aOR 1.48, p=0.049), shopping at small shops (1.9, p&lt;0.002) attending a place of worship (1.81, p=0.005). Conclusions: Exposure to potentially crowded places, public transport and to individuals with a cold increases risk of acquiring circulating acute respiratory infections. This suggests social distancing measures can have an important impact on slowing transmission of emerging respiratory infections.","Hayward, Andrew C.; Beale, Sarah; Johnson, Anne M.; Fragaszy, Ellen B.",Wellcome Open Res.,,424
367484,Limitations in virtual clinical skills education for medical students during COVID-19,2020,"Lack of public funding and environmental deterioration are promoting the search for innovative mechanisms enabling to boost farmers’ provision of agri-environmental climate public goods. This work aims to contribute to the current debate by highlighting the role of innovative contractual solutions through a systematic review of more than 60 articles. The review analyses the potential of result-based and collective contracts as innovative solutions compared to action-based instruments, which are those currently most used. The design of innovative contracts and other mechanisms, e.g., auction and screening contracts, can reduce the policy failures due to asymmetric information. The paper emphasises the trade-off between an accurate design of agri-environmental schemes and the related administrative burden, highlighting the need for a better understanding of the role of mechanisms design into the policy cycle. Some new instruments were not analysed in the review, due to the scarcity of literature, and there is the need of more case studies providing information on the effectiveness of instruments when implemented in different contexts. We fill the gap in empirical evidence through a SWOT analysis that evaluates the effectiveness and acceptability of innovative instruments for policy purposes.","Olivieri, Matteo Andreoli Maria Vergamini Daniele Bartolini Fabio",Sustainability,,424

367724,The structural roots of food insecurity: How racism is a fundamental cause of food insecurity,2021,"INTRODUCTION: We present the reliability of ultra-high field T2* MRI at 7T, as part of the UK7T Network's ""Travelling Heads"" study. T2*-weighted MRI images can be processed to produce quantitative susceptibility maps (QSM) and R2* maps. These reflect iron and myelin concentrations, which are altered in many pathophysiological processes. The relaxation parameters of human brain tissue are such that R2* mapping and QSM show particularly strong gains in contrast-to-noise ratio at ultra-high field (7T) vs clinical field strengths (1.5 - 3T). We aimed to determine the inter-subject and inter-site reproducibility of QSM and R2* mapping at 7T, in readiness for future multi-site clinical studies. METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers were scanned with harmonised single- and multi-echo T2*-weighted gradient echo pulse sequences. Participants were scanned five times at each ""home"" site and once at each of four other sites. The five sites had 1x Philips, 2x Siemens Magnetom, and 2x Siemens Terra scanners. QSM and R2* maps were computed with the Multi-Scale Dipole Inversion (MSDI) algorithm (https://github.com/fil-physics/Publication-Code). Results were assessed in relevant subcortical and cortical regions of interest (ROIs) defined manually or by the MNI152 standard space. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Mean susceptibility (&#967;) and R2* values agreed broadly with literature values in all ROIs. The inter-site within-subject standard deviation was 0.001 - 0.005 ppm (&#967;) and 0.0005 - 0.001 ms-1 (R2*). For &#967; this is 2.1-4.8 fold better than 3T reports, and 1.1-3.4 fold better for R2*. The median ICC from within- and cross-site R2* data was 0.98 and 0.91, respectively. Multi-echo QSM had greater variability vs single-echo QSM especially in areas with large B0 inhomogeneity such as the inferior frontal cortex. Across sites, R2* values were more consistent than QSM in subcortical structures due to differences in B0-shimming. On a between-subject level, our measured &#967; and R2* cross-site variance is comparable to within-site variance in the literature, suggesting that it is reasonable to pool data across sites using our harmonised protocol. CONCLUSION: The harmonized UK7T protocol and pipeline delivers on average a 3-fold improvement in the coefficient of reproducibility for QSM and R2* at 7T compared to previous reports of multi-site reproducibility at 3T. These protocols are ready for use in multi-site clinical studies at 7T.","Rua, Catarina; Clarke, William T; Driver, Ian D; Mougin, Olivier; Morgan, Andrew T; Clare, Stuart; Francis, Susan; Muir, Keith; Wise, Richard; Carpenter, Adrian; Williams, Guy; Rowe, James B; Bowtell, Richard; Rodgers, Christopher T",Neuroimage,,424

We asked patients to score their satisfaction with these visits and if they would have preferred in-person care instead. Of 679 patients seen in May 2020, 512 (75.4%) were virtual (267 [52.1%] by telephone and 245 [47.9%] by video), and 359 (70%) responded to the survey. The majority of patients (74%) were satisfied with their virtual visit, but they were more likely to be satisfied if their visit was over video rather than phone. They preferred an in-person visit if they were meeting a doctor for the first time, and patients who required a language interpreter were significantly less satisfied with virtual care. There was no correlation of age, sex, diagnosis, or testing ordered with satisfaction. The main concern against virtual care was the inability to have a physical exam, while the main reasons in favor of it were avoidance of potential infection and convenience.","Mortezavi, M.; Lokineni, S.; Garg, M.; Chen, Y.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: We followed 102 patients discharged home with a diagnosis of pneumonia compatible with COVID19 between March 12 and 21, 2020, in our hospital in the southern part of the autonomous community of Madrid. Descriptive statistics (medians and interquartile ranges or frequencies, as appropriate) were compiled for the main variables. Treatments and prognoses were compared with ?2, Kruskal-Wallis, or Mann-Whitney tests. The data then underwent logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Most patients (accounting for 74.5% of the discharges) were treated with hydroxychloroquine alone. The readmission rate was 15.7%;the ED revisiting rate was 25.7%. Admission was associated with an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level (P=.011), elevated creatine kinase (CK) (P=.004), and lymphopenia (P=.034). Hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were also related to admission. Ischemic heart disease was associated with longer duration of symptoms. CONCLUSION: Lymphopenia, and elevated LDH and CK levels predicted the need for hospital admission better than other traditional biological markers in patients with mild to moderate symptoms. Telephone follow-up proved useful for dealing with the overloading of health care services.","Gutierrez Gabriel, S.; Dominguez Garcia, M.

Our results showed that sequential immunization with adenovirus vectored vaccine followed by inactivated/recombinant subunit/mRNA vaccine administration specifically increased levels of neutralizing antibodies and promoted the modulation of antibody responses to predominantly neutralizing antibodies. Moreover, a heterologous prime-boost regimen with an adenovirus vector vaccine also improved Th1-biased T cell responses. Our results provide new ideas for the development and application of COVID-19 vaccines to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.","He, Qian; Mao, Qunying; An, Chaoqiang; Zhang, Jialu; Gao, Fan; Bian, Lianlian; Li, Changgui; Liang, Zhenglun; Xu, Miao; Wang, Junzhi",Emerg Microbes Infect,,424

The SARS-CoV-2 is causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A set of 58 molecules belongs to the naphthyridine and quinoline derivatives have been recently synthesized and considered for structure-based virtual screening against Nsp16-Nsp10. Molecular docking was virtually performed to screen for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity against Nsp16-Nsp10. Fourteen out of fifty-eight compounds were exhibited binding affinity higher than co-crystal bound ligand s-adenosylmethionine (SAM) toward Nsp16-Nsp10. Further, the in silico pharmacokinetics assessment was carried out and it was found that two molecules possess the acceptable pharmacokinetic profile, hence considered promising Nsp16-Nsp10 inhibitors. The binding interaction analysis was revealed some crucial binding interactions between the final selected two molecules and ligand-binding amino acid residues of Nsp16-Nsp10 protein. In order to explore the characteristics of the protein-ligand complex and how selected small molecules retained inside the receptor cavity in dynamic states, all-atoms conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed. Several factors were obtained from the MD simulation trajectory evidently suggested the potentiality of the molecules and stability of the protein-ligand complex. Finally, the binding affinity of both molecules and SAM was explored through the MM-GBSA approach which explained that both molecules possess strong affection towards the Nsp16-Nsp10. Hence, from the pharmacoinformatics assessment, it can be concluded that both heterocyclic compounds might be crucial for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition, subjected to experimental validation.

RESULTS: The GRP78 level was found to be significantly higher in the Covid-19 infection group than both Covid-19 (-) pneumonia and control group (p = 0.031 and p = 0.0001, respectively).No significant difference was evident between Covid-19 (-) pneumonia, Covid-19 (+) pneumonia and CT negative Covid 19 infection groups with respect to GRP78 levels (p = 0.09). In addition, the GRP78 levels were significantly higher in the Covid-19 (-) pneumonia group than the control group (p = 0.0001). CONCLUSION: This prospective case-control study reveals that the serum GRP78 levels significantly increased during Covid-19 infection in comparison to both the Covid-19 (-) pneumonia and the control group. As the association between SARS-CoV-2 virus and GRP78 protein is revealed more clearly, this association may come to the fore as a therapeutic target.","Sabirli, Ramazan; Koseler, Aylin; Goren, Tarik; Turkcuer, Ibrahim; Kurt, Ozgur",Life Sci,,424

377254,A study on the effectiveness of online teaching in pharmacy education from teacher and student perspectives during the covid-19 pandemic,2020,"By examining the global public good nature of pandemic preparedness we can identify key social justice issues that need to be confronted to increase citizens' voluntary compliance with prevention and mitigation measures. As people tend to cooperate on a voluntary basis only with systems they consider fair, it becomes difficult to ensure compliance with public health measures in a context of extreme inequality. Among the major inequalities that need to be addressed we can find major differences in the extensiveness and intensiveness of quarantine experiences, lack of opportunities to participate in common efforts, hardship in complying with disease control recommendations, and an unfair distribution of the cooperative surplus.","Timmermann, Cristian",,,424
377925,Malawi at the Crossroads: Does the Fear of Contracting COVID-19 Affect the Propensity to Vote?,2021,"PURPOSE: The coronavirus pandemic has redefined the practice of head and neck surgeons in the management of oncology patients. Several countries have issued practice recommendations in that context. This review is a collaboration of the YO-IFOS (Young Otolaryngologists of the International Federation of Otolaryngological Societies) group in order to summarize, in a systematic way, all available guidelines and provide clear guidelines for the management of head and neck cancer patients in the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: This systematic review was performed according to the PRISMA statements. Inclusion criteria for the systematic review were based on the population, intervention, comparison, and outcomes according to (PICO) framework. The AGREE II (Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II) instrument was used to assess quality of all practice guidelines included in this review. RESULTS: Recommendations include adjustments regarding new patients' referral such as performing a pre-appointment triage and working in telemedicine when possible. Surgical prioritization must be adjusted in order to respect pandemic requirements. High-grade malignancies should, howeve,r not be delayed, due to potential serious consequences. Many head and neck interventions being aerosol-generating procedures, COVID-19 testing prior to a surgery and adequate PPE precautions are essential in operating rooms. CONCLUSION: These recommendations for head and neck oncology patients serve as a guide for physicians in the pandemic. Adjustments and updates are necessary as the pandemic evolves.","Gascon, Laurence; Fournier, Isabelle; Chiesa-Estomba, Carlos; Russo, Gennaro; Fakhry, Nicolas; Lechien, Jérôme R; Burnell, Lisa; Vergez, Sebastien; Metwaly, Osama; Capasso, Pasquale; Ayad, Tareck",Eur. arch. oto-rhino-laryngol,,424

378925,First deceased by covid-19 in Peru/ Primer fallecido por COVID-19 en el Perú,2020,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: To examine change in subjective age with the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Two competing hypotheses were tested: (a) people felt increasingly older due to the stress generated by the pandemic; (b) people felt increasingly younger due to psychological distancing from older age, a vulnerability to COVID-19. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: An age and sex stratified sample of adults from across the United States (baseline N = 3,738) was assessed on three occasions: before the COVID-19 outbreak in late-January/early-February and during the outbreak in late-March and again in late-April. Multilevel modeling analysis examined change in subjective age and tested potential moderators of individual differences in the trajectory of subjective age. RESULTS: The average trajectory of subjective age followed a concave curve, with a nadir (feeling younger) during the second assessment in late-March. Older age, negative expectations about aging, absence of pre-existing conditions, and less stress during COVID-19 were associated with feeling younger but did not predict the rate of change. The only significant predictor of change in subjective age was the belief that the ""coronavirus is only a threat to older adults"": The more individuals agreed with this statement, the more likely it was that they felt increasingly younger at follow-up. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS: Subjective age changed during a global health crisis, with people feeling younger with the emergence COVID-19. The findings support the hypothesis that subjective age partly reflects a coping process of psychological distancing from older age, the age group most vulnerable to COVID-19.","Terracciano, Antonio; Stephan, Yannick; Aschwanden, Damaris; Lee, Ji Hyun; Sesker, Amanda A; Strickhouser, Jason E; Luchetti, Martina; Sutin, Angelina R",GerontologistGerontologist,,424

Opportunities range from the quality of attention or the structure of the time during the visit, to supporting relationship development in how care is organized at the local or system level and in the use of digital encounters. These ways of investing in relationships can exhibit different manifestations and emphases during different kinds of visits, but most are available during all kinds of encounters.Recognizing and supporting the many ways of investing in relationships has great potential to create a positive sea change in a health care system that currently feels fragmented and depersonalized to both patients and health care clinicians.The current COVID-19 pandemic is full of opportunity to use remote communication to develop healing human relationships.

In addition to pulmonary symptoms; COVID-19 as a syndrome has multisystemic involvement including frequent gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea. Due to microbiome alterations with COVID-19 and frequent antibiotic exposure, COVID-19 can be complicated by Clostridioides difficile infection. Co-infection with these two can be associated with a high risk of complications. Infection control measures in hospitals is enhanced due to the COVID-19 pandemic which in turn appears to reduce the incidence of hospital-acquired infections such as C. difficile infection.

Monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) is one of the promising targets for the imaging of astrogliosis in the human brain. A novel selective and reversible MAO-B tracer, (S)-(2-methylpyrid-5-yl)-6-[(3-[18F]fluoro-2-hydroxy)propoxy]quinoline, (18F-SMBT-1), was successfully developed via lead optimization from first-generation tau positron-emission tomography (PET) tracer 18F-THK-5351. Methods: SMBT-1 was radiolabeled with fluorine-18 using the corresponding precursor. The binding affinity of radiolabeled compounds to MAO-B was assessed using saturation and competitive binding assays. The binding selectivity of 18F-SMBT-1 to MAO-B was evaluated by autoradiography of frozen human brain tissues. The pharmacokinetics (PK) and metabolism were assessed in normal mice after intravenous administration of 18F-SMBT-1. A 14-day toxicity study following the intravenous administration of SMBT-1 was performed using rats and mice. Results: In vitro binding assays demonstrated a high binding affinity of SMBT-1 to MAO-B (KD = 3.7 nM). In contrast, it showed low binding affinity to MAO-A and protein aggregates such as amyloid-ß and tau fibrils. Autoradiographic analysis showed higher amounts of 18F-SMBT-1 binding in the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain sections than in the control brain sections. 18F-SMBT-1 binding was completely displaced with reversible MAO-B inhibitor lazabemide, demonstrating the high selectivity of 18F-SMBT-1 for MAO-B. Furthermore, 18F-SMBT-1 showed a high uptake by brain, rapid washout, and no radiolabeled metabolites in the brain of normal mice. SMBT-1 showed no significant binding to various receptors, ion channels, and transporters, and no toxic effects related to its administration were observed in mice and rats. Conclusion: 18F-SMBT-1 is a promising and selective MAO-B PET tracer candidate, which would be useful for quantitative monitoring of astrogliosis in the human brain.","Harada, Ryuichi; Hayakawa, Yoshimi; Ezura, Michinori; Lerdsirisuk, Pradith; Du, Yiqing; Ishikawa, Yoichi; Iwata, Ren; Shidahara, Miho; Ishiki, Aiko; Kikuchi, Akio; Arai, Hiroyuki; Kudo, Yukitsuka; Yanai, Kazuhiko; Furumoto, Shozo; Okamura, Nobuyuki",J. nucl. med,,424

The Lombardy region faced firstly this outbreak in Italy and recorded rapidly a saturation of intensive care and internal medicine beds. Consequently, this lack of technical and human resources, together with people mobility restriction to contain virus spreading, determined the interruption of elective surgical and interventional cardiovascular procedures. In addition, the emergency track of acute patients has been rewritten due to limited resources and viral co-infection (pre- or in-hospital). Herein, we describe two cases of acute coronary syndrome with severe coronary artery disease and an indication for coronary artery bypass grafting. The first patient, COVID-19 positive, was treated with transcatheter technique due to symptom instability and underwent temporary circulatory support without intubation. The second patient received an intra-aortic balloon pump and was then transferred, in accordance with government emergency provisions, to a hub hospital to undergo off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting and short intensive care unit stay. These two apparently similar cases were treated differently according to the moving epidemiological and organizational conditions.","Villa, Emmanuel; Saccocci, Matteo; Messina, Antonio; Maffeo, Diego; Pitì, Antonino; Bianchetti, Federico; Cuccia, Claudio; Troise, Giovanni",G Ital Cardiol (Rome),,424

From January 31 to February 2, 2020, a high prevalence of moderate to severe anxiety was detected due to COVID-19 outbreak. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and correlates of somatization among Chinese participants with anxiety receiving online crisis interventions from Feb 14 to Mar 29 during the COVID-19 epidemic. METHODS: A total of 1134 participants who participated in online crisis interventions completed the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale and the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) and demographic questions online. Somatization was defined as the average score of each item &#8805; 2 in SCL-90 somatization subscale. Moderate to severe anxiety was defined as a score &#8805; 10 in the GAD-7 scale. RESULTS: Among all participants, 8.0% reported moderate to severe anxiety and 7.4% reported somatization. After March 1, the prevalence of anxiety with or without somatization did not significantly change (both p > 0.05), while the prevalence of somatization increased significantly (p < 0.01). Logistic regression analysis indicated that somatization was associated with chronic disease history (with an odds ratio of 4.80) and female gender (with an odds ratio of 0.33). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the history of chronic diseases is associated with somatization in individuals with anxiety, indicating some stress-related mechanisms. Chinese men in crisis intervention need more attention because they are more likely to report anxiety comorbid somatization.","Shangguan, Fangfang; Quan, Xiao; Qian, Wei; Zhou, Chenhao; Zhang, Chen; Zhang, Xiang Yang; Liu, Zhengkui",J Affect Disord,,424

Among the general population, university students appear to be particularly susceptible to experiencing mental health problems. Objectives: To measure the prevalence of self-reported mental health symptoms, to identify associated factors, and to assess care seeking among university students who experienced the COVID-19 quarantine in France. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study collected data from April 17 to May 4, 2020, from 69â¯054 students living in France during the COVID-19 quarantine. All French universities were asked to send an email to their students asking them to complete an online questionnaire. The targeted population was approximately 1â¯600â¯000 students. Exposure: Living in France during the COVID-19 quarantine. Main Outcomes and Measures: The rates of self-reported suicidal thoughts, severe distress, stress, anxiety, and depression were assessed using the 22-item Impact of Events Scale-Revised, the 10-item Perceived Stress Scale, the 20-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (State subscale), and the 13-item Beck Depression Inventory, respectively. Covariates were sociodemographic characteristics, precariousness indicators (ie, loss of income or poor quality housing), health-related data, information on the social environment, and media consumption. Data pertaining to care seeking were also collected. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify risk factors. Results: A total of 69â¯054 students completed the survey (response rate, 4.3%). The median (interquartile range) age was 20 (18-22) years. The sample was mainly composed of women (50â¯251 [72.8%]) and first-year students (32â¯424 [47.0%]). The prevalence of suicidal thoughts, severe distress, high level of perceived stress, severe depression, and high level of anxiety were 11.4% (7891 students), 22.4% (15â¯463 students), 24.7% (17â¯093 students), 16.1% (11â¯133 students), and 27.5% (18â¯970 students), respectively, with 29â¯564 students (42.8%) reporting at least 1 outcome, among whom 3675 (12.4%) reported seeing a health professional.

COVID-19 is caused by a novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which enters human target cells via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). We used a number of bioinformatics tools to computationally characterize ACE2 by determining its cell-specific expression in trachea, lung, and small intestine, derive its putative functions, and predict transcriptional regulation. The small intestine expressed higher levels of ACE2 mRNA than any other organ. By immunohistochemistry, duodenum, kidney and testis showed strong signals, whereas the signal was weak in the respiratory tract. Single cell RNA-Seq data from trachea indicated positive signals along the respiratory tract in key protective cell types including club, goblet, proliferating, and ciliary epithelial cells; while in lung the ratio of ACE2-expressing cells was low in all cell types (<2.6%), but was highest in vascular endothelial and goblet cells. Gene ontology analysis suggested that, besides its classical role in the renin-angiotensin system, ACE2 may be functionally associated with angiogenesis/blood vessel morphogenesis. Using a novel tool for the prediction of transcription factor binding sites we identified several putative binding sites within two tissue-specific promoters of the ACE2 gene as well as a new putative short form of ACE2. These include several interferon-stimulated response elements sites for STAT1, IRF8, and IRF9. Our results also confirmed that age and gender play no significant role in the regulation of ACE2 mRNA expression in the lung.","Barker, Harlan; Parkkila, Seppo",PLoS One,,424

METHODS: Using electronic medical records, weekly trends in SARS-CoV-2 tests performed and the 14-day moving average of test positivity were examined, overall and by age group, during May 24-December 5, 2020. RESULTS: Among 4,995 patients who received at least 1 SARS-CoV-2 test, 6,813 total tests were completed. Overall test positivity was 5.4% and was higher among older pediatric patients (<5 years: 3.3%; 5-11 years: 4.1%; 12-17 years: 8.6%). The number of tests and test positivity increased after holidays and school breaks. CONCLUSIONS: Families might benefit from communication focused on reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission during holidays. In addition, given higher test positivity in children aged 12-17 years, tailoring public health messaging to older adolescents could help limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk in this population.","Miller, Maureen J; Dasgupta, Sharoda; Ruffin, Jasmine; Colton, Kevin; King, David; Tate, Jacqueline E; Kirking, Hannah L; Bryant, Bobbi; Hennesy, Nora; Plata, Zuwena; Nakayama, Jasmine Y; Tanner, Mary R; Koyuncu, Aybüke; Rabold, Elizabeth",J Adolesc Health,,424

While standard RF algorithms use bootstrap out-of-bag samples to compute out-of-bag scores, WW uses these samples to produce improved predictions given by an aggregation of the predictions of all possible subtrees of each fully grown tree in the forest. This is achieved by aggregation with exponential weights computed over out-of-bag samples, that are computed exactly and very efficiently thanks to an algorithm called context tree weighting. This improvement, combined with a histogram strategy to accelerate split finding, makes WW fast and competitive compared with other well-established ensemble methods, such as standard RF and extreme gradient boosting algorithms.","Gaiffas, St'ephane; Merad, Ibrahim; Yu, Yiyang",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.08010v1.pdf,424

384448,COVID-19 and autism research: Perspectives from around the globe: COVID-19 pandemic offers unique challenges and opportunities that transcend borders,2020,"BACKGROUND: Because of the increased risk for severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) initially prioritized COVID-19 vaccination for persons in long-term care facilities (LTCF), persons aged &#8805;65 years, and persons aged 16-64 years with high-risk medical conditions when there is limited vaccine supply. We compared characteristics and severe outcomes of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 in the United States between early and later in the pandemic categorized by groups at higher risk of severe COVID-19. METHODS: Observational study of sampled patients aged &#8805;18 years who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and admitted to one of 14 academic hospitals in the United States during March-June and October-December 2020. Demographic and clinical information were gathered from electronic health record data. RESULTS: Among 647 patients, 91% met &#8805;1 of the following risk factors for severe COVID-19 [91% March-June (n=434); 90% October-December (n=213)]; 19% were LTCF residents, 45% were aged &#8805;65-years, and 84% had &#8805;1 high-risk condition. The proportion of patients who resided in a LTCF declined significantly (25% vs. 6%) from early to later pandemic periods. Compared with patients at lower risk for severe COVID-19, in-hospital mortality was higher among patients at high risk for severe COVID-19 (20% vs. 7%); these differences were consistently observed between March-June and October-December. CONCLUSIONS: Most adults hospitalized with COVID-19 were those recommended to be prioritized for vaccination based on risk for developing severe COVID-19. These findings highlight the urgency to vaccinate patients at high risk for severe COVID-19 and monitor vaccination impact on hospitalizations and outcomes.","Sami, Samira; Tenforde, Mark W; Talbot, H Keipp; Lindsell, Christopher J; Steingrub, Jay S; Shapiro, Nathan I; Ginde, Adit A; Douin, David J; Prekker, Matthew E; Erickson, Heidi L; Brown, Samuel M; Peltan, Ithan D; Gong, Michelle N; Khan, Akram; Exline, Matthew C; Files, D Clark; Gibbs, Kevin W; Rice, Todd W; Casey, Jonathan D; Grijalva, Carlos G; Stubblefield, William B; Womack, Kelsey N; Hager, David N; Qadir, Nida; Chang, Steven Y; Henning, Daniel J; Wilson, Jennifer G; Self, Wesley H; Patel, Manish M",Clin. infect. dis,,424

METHODS: We conducted an interrupted time-series (lockdown on 23 March 2020 as point of interruption) analysis in asthma cohort identified using a validated algorithm from a national-level primary care database, the Optimum Patient Care Database. We derived asthma exacerbation rates for every week and compared exacerbation rates in the period: January to August 2020 with a pre-COVID-19 period and January to August 2016-2019. Exacerbations were defined as asthma-related hospital attendance/admission (including accident and emergency visit), or an acute course of oral corticosteroids with evidence of respiratory review, as recorded in primary care. We used a generalised least squares modelling approach and stratified the analyses by age, sex, English region and healthcare setting. RESULTS: From a database of 9 949 387 patients, there were 100 165 patients with asthma who experienced at least one exacerbation during 2016-2020. Of 278 996 exacerbation episodes, 49 938 (17.9%) required hospital visit. Comparing pre-lockdown to post-lockdown period, we observed a statistically significant reduction in the level (-0.196 episodes per person-year; p<0.001; almost 20 episodes for every 100 patients with asthma per year) of exacerbation rates across all patients. The reductions in level in stratified analyses were: 0.005-0.244 (healthcare setting, only those without hospital attendance/admission were significant), 0.210-0.277 (sex), 0.159-0.367 (age), 0.068-0.590 (region). CONCLUSIONS: There has been a significant reduction in attendance to primary care for asthma exacerbations during the pandemic. This reduction was observed in all age groups, both sexes and across most regions in England.","Shah, Syed A; Quint, Jennifer K; Nwaru, Bright I; Sheikh, Aziz",Thorax,,424

Because past research on antecedents of unethical behavior has not provided a clear answer, we turned to machine learning to generate novel hypotheses. We trained a deep-learning model to predict whether or not World Values Survey respondents perceived unethical behaviors as justifiable, on the basis of their responses to 708 other items. The model identified optimism about the future of humanity as one of the top predictors of unethicality. A preregistered correlational study (N = 218 U.S. residents) conceptually replicated this finding. A preregistered experiment (N = 294 U.S. residents) provided causal support: Participants who read a scenario conveying optimism about the COVID-19 pandemic were less willing to justify hoarding and violating social-distancing guidelines than participants who read a scenario conveying pessimism. The findings suggest that optimism can help reduce unethicality, and they document the utility of machine-learning methods for generating novel hypotheses.","Sheetal, Abhishek; Feng, Zhiyu; Savani, Krishna",Psychol Sci,,424
385115,Global Social Policy Digest 21.1: An equitable and sustainable recovery from COVID-19?,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic led government regulators to relax prescribing rules for buprenorphine and methadone, the agonist medications that effectively treat opioid use disorder, allowing for take home supplies of up to 28 days. These changes prioritized the availability of these medications over concerns about their misuse and diversion, and they provided a means for overdose prophylaxis during the highly uncertain conditions of the pandemic. In considering how to capitalize on this shift, research should determine the extent to which increased diversion has occurred as a result, and what the consequences may have been. The shifts also set the stage to consider if methadone can be safely prescribed in primary care settings, and if the monthly injectable formulation of buprenorphine is a suitable alternative to increased supplies of sublingual strips if concerns about diversion persist. The disruptions of the pandemic have caused a surge in overdose deaths, so carefully considering the prophylactic potential of agonist medications, in addition to their role as a treatment, may help us address this mortality crisis.","Del Pozo, Brandon; Rich, Josiah D",J Subst Abuse Treat,,424
385249,Sustainability of Borders in a Post-COVID-19 World,2021,"SARS-CoV-2 attaches to its host receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), via the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. The RBD glycoprotein is a critical target for the development of neutralizing antibodies and vaccines against SARS-CoV-2. However, the high heterogeneity of RBD glycoforms may lead to an incomplete neutralization effect and impact the immunogenic integrity of RBD-based vaccines. Investigating the role of different carbohydrate domains is of paramount importance. Unfortunately, there is no viable method for preparing RBD glycoproteins with structurally defined glycans. Herein we describe a highly efficient and scalable strategy for the preparation of six glycosylated RBDs bearing defined structure glycoforms at T323, N331 and N343. A combination of modern oligosaccharide, peptide synthesis and recombinant protein engineering provides a robust route to deciphering carbohydrate structure-function relationships.","Wang, Ping; Ye, Farong; Zhao, Jie; Xu, Peng; Liu, Xinliang; Yu, Jing; Shangguan, Wei; Liu, Jiazhi; Luo, Xiaosheng; Li, Cheng; Ying, Tianlei; Wang, Jing; Yu, Biao",Angew. chem; int. ed. engl,,424

MethodsThe study was a cross-sectional assessment of 776 consenting Nigerian adults that were distributed across the 6 geo-political zones and the Federal Capital Territory. Online pre-tested, semi-structured questionnaire were used to obtain the socio-demographic data and assessed the knowledge and risk perception of the participants to COVID-19. The knowledge of COVID-19 was assessed based on the number of accurate responses given in comparison to average scores. Chi-square analysis was computed to analysis the association between socio-demographic characteristics and knowledge of COVID-19 and risk perception. Data analysis was done using SPSS version 21, the level of significance was set at value p<0.05 at 95% confidence interval. ResultsMajority of the participants were male 451 (58.1%), there was a good knowledge of COVID-19 among 90.3% of respondents with 57% having positive risk perception. There was a statistically significant relationship between good knowledge and positive risk perception of COVID-19 (p < 0.001). Annual income (p =0.012) and the perception that ""vaccines are good"" significantly predict positive risk perception of COVID-19 among the respondents. ConclusionA good knowledge of COVID-19 and vaccination against the virus were the two most important factors that determined risk perception among the population.

This study focused on describing air quality during the initial phase of the Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic (since there were fewer anthropogenic activities) in 10 Chinese mega-cities. Using the independent t-test, the means of air quality index (AQI) scores and individual air pollutants concentration during the outbreak were compared with the means before the outbreak. Cohen's d was estimated to quantify how much difference was observed. Based on the AQI score, the air quality in these 10 cities ranged from excellent (Shenzhen) to light pollution (Xi'an) with 44.8 µg m-3 and 119.7 µg m-3, respectively. In comparison to the 2019 air quality, Guangzhou and Wuhan noted major differences in air quality during the outbreak. Indicators of traffic pollution, particularly NO2, were significantly lower during the outbreak in all cities. Particulate matter pollution varied, with some cities observing lower concentrations and other higher concentrations during the outbreak. There was a significant decrease in air pollution levels during the outbreak. More researchers should observe changes in air quality during peculiar or major events. Implementation of stringent regulation on vehicle use should be considered in mega-cities. Relevant findings should be employed in emphasizing the detrimental effects of anthropogenic activities and support the need for stringent emission control regulations.","Ethan, Crystal Jane; Mokoena, Kingsley Katleho; Yu, Yan",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,424

Simple cross-sectional regressions are able to predict quite accurately both the total number of cases and deaths, which cast doubt on measures aimed at controlling the disease via lockdowns. Population density appears to play a significant role in transmission. This throws in sharp relief the relative effectiveness of the attempts to risk manage the spread of the virus by 'flattening the curve' (aka planking the curve) of the speed of transmission, and the efficacy of lockdowns in terms of the spread of the disease and death rates.

387082,World AIDS Day 2020: Reflections on global and South African progress and continuing challenges,2021,"OBJECTIVES: The suspension of elective surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and has resulted in record volumes of patients waiting for operations. Novel approaches that maximise capacity and efficiency of surgical care are urgently required. This study applies Markov multiscale community detection (MMCD), an unsupervised graph-based clustering framework, to identify new surgical care models based on pooled waiting-lists delivered across an expanded network of surgical providers. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study using Hospital Episode Statistics. SETTING: Public and private hospitals providing surgical care to National Health Service (NHS) patients in England. PARTICIPANTS: All adult patients resident in England undergoing NHS-funded planned surgical procedures between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The identification of the most common planned surgical procedures in England (high-volume procedures (HVP)) and proportion of low, medium and high-risk patients undergoing each HVP. The mapping of hospitals providing surgical care onto optimised groupings based on patient usage data. RESULTS: A total of 7 811 891 planned operations were identified in 4 284 925 adults during the 1-year period of our study. The 28 most common surgical procedures accounted for a combined 3 907 474 operations (50.0% of the total). 2 412 613 (61.7%) of these most common procedures involved 'low risk' patients. Patients travelled an average of 11.3 km for these procedures. Based on the data, MMCD partitioned England into 45, 16 and 7 mutually exclusive and collectively exhaustive natural surgical communities of increasing coarseness. The coarser partitions into 16 and seven surgical communities were shown to be associated with balanced supply and demand for surgical care within communities.

388841,A Feminist Perspective on COVID-19 and the Value of Care Work Globally,2020,"Managing the pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 requires new capabilities in testing, including the possibility of identifying, in minutes, infected individuals as they enter spaces where they must congregate in a functioning society, including workspaces, schools, points of entry, and commercial business establishments. Here, the only useful tests (a) require no sample transport, (b) require minimal sample manipulation, (c) can be performed by unlicensed individuals, (d) return results on the spot in much less than one hour, and (e) cost no more than a few dollars. The sensitivity need not be as high as normally required by the FDA for screening asymptomatic carriers (as few as 10 virions per sample), as these viral loads are almost certainly not high enough for an individual to present a risk for forward infection. This allows tests specifically useful for this pandemic to trade-off unneeded sensitivity for necessary speed, simplicity, and frugality. In some studies, it was shown that viral load that creates forward-infection risk may exceed 105 virions per milliliter, easily within the sensitivity of an RNA amplification architecture, but unattainable by antibody-based architectures that simply target viral antigens. Here, we describe such a test based on a displaceable probe loop amplification architecture.","Yaren, Ozlem; McCarter, Jacquelyn; Phadke, Nikhil; Bradley, Kevin M; Overton, Benjamin; Yang, Zunyi; Ranade, Shatakshi; Patil, Kunal; Bangale, Rishikesh; Benner, Steven A",PLoS One,,424
389610,The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on customer experience design: The hotel managers’ perspective,2021,"Purpose: Emerging reports have shown an increased incidence of pulmonary embolism (PE) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients which subsequently worsens respiratory distress and can lead to further clinical deterioration. We sought to determine whether PE in Corona virus patients were more likely thrombotic or embolic in etiology, and the role of IVC filters in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Materials and Methods: A single-center retrospective analysis evaluating all CT pulmonary angiograms (684) that were completed at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic between March 15, 2020, and May 31, 2020, at a tertiary care center in an urban setting. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) was defined as iliocaval or femoropopliteal thrombus on lower extremity Doppler or CT with lower extremity runoff, or brachial, axillary, subclavian, or internal jugular vein thrombus on upper extremity Doppler. PE was considered thrombotic in patients in the absence of DVT and embolic in the presence of DVT during their inpatient stay. COVID-19 status was based on the most recent results prior to the patient’s CT pulmonary angiogram, if testing was not conducted, the patient was considered negative for COVID-19. Chi-square analysis was carried out to determine the difference in rates between thrombotic versus embolic PE in Corona virus positive and negative patients. Results: Imaging confirmed acute PE in 112 patients during this period, of which 43 (38%) tested positive for COVID-19, and 69 (62%) tested negative. Of patients testing positive for Corona virus with PE, imaging confirmed concurrent lower or upper extremity DVT in 4 of 43 patients (9%) and ruled out DVT in 24 of 43 patients (56%). Whereas, in COVID-19 negative patients with PE, imaging confirmation of DVT was seen in 19 of 69 patients (28%) and DVT was ruled out in 21 of 69 patients (30%). This correlated with a chi-square value of 8.12 (P = 0.004). Conclusions: Pulmonary emboli in COVID-19 patients are more likely to be thrombotic rather than embolic in etiology, limiting the utility of IVC filters in Corona virus patients.","Anavim, A.; Ahuja, R.; Desai, A.; Yun, J.; Natarajan, B.",Journal of Vascular and Interventional Radiology,,424
390217,Enacting Bioethics,2020,"Countries across the world responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with what might well be the set of biggest state-led mobility and activity restrictions in the history of humankind. But how effective were these measures across countries? Compared to multiple recent studies that document an association between such restrictions and the control of the contagion, we use an instrumental variable approach to estimate the causal effect of these restrictions on mobility, and the growth rate of confirmed cases and deaths during the first wave of the pandemic. Using the level of stringency in the rest of the world to predict the level of stringency of the restriction measures in a country, we show while stricter contemporaneous measures affected mobility, stringency in seven to fourteen days mattered most for containing the contagion. Heterogeneity analysis, by various institutional inequalities, reveals that even though the restrictions reduced mobility more in relatively less-developed countries, the causal effect of a reduction in mobility was higher in more developed countries. We propose several explanations. Our results highlight the need to complement mobility and activity restrictions with other health and information measures, especially in less-developed countries, to combat the COVID-19 pandemic effectively.","Fakir, Adnan M S; Bharati, Tushar",PLoS One,,424
390218,Enacting Bioethics,2020,"OBJECTIVE: To determine the training surgical residents and faculty receive on opioid prescribing, and to identify opportunities for curricula development to fill training gaps. DESIGN: We conducted qualitative semi-structured interviews and surveys. After applying an overarching organizational framework, we used an iterative, team-based process to develop relevant inductive codes. We then performed thematic analyses to identify and catalogue critical domains related to surgeons' education about opioid prescribing. SETTING: Tertiary care academic medical center. PARTICIPANTS: Maximum variation purposive sampling was used to recruit general surgery residents and surgical faculty members. RESULTS: We interviewed 21 attending surgeons and 20 surgical residents. Surgeons reported minimal formal training on pain management and prescribing opioids. A minority of individuals described receiving opioid training in the form of continuing medical education, intern boot camp sessions, and medical school classes. Participants compensated for the lack of formal training during residency by informally learning from senior residents, consulting pain specialists, and seeking external learning resources. Increased surgical experience was correlated with increased comfort with pain management. A majority of surgeons desired formal training. The most commonly requested educational resources were opioid prescribing guidelines for common operations and recommendations for treating chronic pain patients. Residents requested that training occur early in residency to maximize the benefits received. Based on these findings, we developed a conceptual framework to explain how surgeons learn to prescribe opioids and to highlight opportunities for improvement. CONCLUSIONS: Although surgeons routinely prescribe opioids and desire education on opioids, a majority of them do not receive any training. Instituting formal educational programs is critical for improving opioid prescribing practices among surgeons.These programs should include standard prescribing guidelines and address management of acute postoperative pain in patients with chronic pain.","Ayakta, Nagehan; Sceats, Lindsay A; Merrell, Sylvia Bereknyei; Kin, Cindy",J. surg. educ,,424

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic review (SR) and meta-analysis (MA) of previously published works were performed. The search strategy included all known descriptors for Covid-19 and tobacco and was conducted in different databases. Appropriate statistical models were used to address the effect size in meta-analysis, namely random effects and fixed effects model. RESULTS: Thirty-four articles were identified in the SR of which 19 were included in the MA. Being a smoker or former smoker was shown to be a risk factor for worse progression of Covid-19 infection (OR 1.96, 95% CI, 1.36 - 2.83) and a greater probability of presenting a more critical condition (OR 1.79 95% CI, 1.19 - 2.70). As limitations of the MA, we found that most of the studies analyzed were observational with limited publication bias. Two studies that disagreed with the rest were included, although after withdrawing them from the MA, smoking was maintained as a risk factor for worse progress. CONCLUSION: Current and past smoking produces a more serious clinical form of Covid-19 and more frequently leads to intensive care admission, intubation, and death.","Jiménez-Ruiz, Carlos A; López-Padilla, Daniel; Alonso-Arroyo, Adolfo; Aleixandre-Benavent, Rafael; Solano-Reina, Segismundo; de Granda-Orive, José Ignacio",Arch. bronconeumol.

Methods and Results In a single-center parallel group, open label, randomized controlled trial, 110 participants were randomized to receive either TIC (n=55) or TIC+ASP (n=55) for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was the platelet aggregation response with 10 µmol/L thrombin receptor activation peptide-6 (TRAP-6). The secondary outcomes were platelet aggregation responses and binding of surface activation markers with a panel of other activators. The mean percentage aggregation for 10 µmol/L TRAP-6 was similar for the TIC and TIC+ASP groups (mean difference+4.29; 95% CI, -0.87 to +9.46). Aggregation was higher in the TIC group compared with the TIC+ASP group with 1 µg/mL (+6.47; +2.04 to +10.90) and 0.5 µg/mL (+14.00; +7.63 to +20.39) collagen related peptide. Aggregation responses with 5 µmol/L TRAP-6, 5 µmol/L or 2.5 µmol/L thromboxane A2 receptor agonist and surface activation marker binding with 5 µmol/L TRAP-6 or 0.5 µg/mL collagen related peptide were the same between the treatment groups. Conclusions Patients with PCI show similar levels of inhibition of most platelet activation pathways with TIC compared with dual therapy with TIC + ASP. However, the greater aggregation response with collagen related peptide during TIC indicates incomplete inhibition of glycoprotein VI (collagen) receptor-mediated platelet activation. This difference in pharmacodynamic response to anti-platelet medication may contribute to the lower bleeding rates observed with TIC compared with dual antiplatelet therapy in recent clinical trials.

397302,Assessment of dry eye symptoms and quality of sleep in engineering students during the COVID-19 pandemic,2020,"Different respiratory infections cause abnormal symptoms in lung parenchyma that show in chest computed tomography. Since December 2019, the SARS-COV-2 virus, which is the causative agent of COVID-19, has invaded the world causing high numbers of infections and deaths. The infection with SARS-COV-2 virus shows an abnormality in lung parenchyma that can be effectively detected using Computed Tomography (CT) imaging. In this paper, a novel computer aided framework (COV-CAF) is proposed for classifying the severity degree of the infection from 3D Chest Volumes. COV-CAF fuses traditional and deep learning approaches. The proposed COV-CAF consists of two phases: the preparatory phase and the feature analysis and classification phase. The preparatory phase handles 3D-CT volumes and presents an effective cut choice strategy for choosing informative CT slices. The feature analysis and classification phase incorporate fuzzy clustering for automatic Region of Interest (RoI) segmentation and feature fusion. In feature fusion, automatic features are extracted from a newly introduced Convolution Neural Network (Norm-VGG16) and are fused with spatial hand-crafted features extracted from segmented RoI. Experiments are conducted on MosMedData: Chest CT Scans with COVID-19 Related Findings with COVID-19 severity classes and SARS-COV-2 CT-Scan benchmark datasets. The proposed COV-CAF achieved remarkable results on both datasets. On MosMedData dataset, it achieved an overall accuracy of 97.76% and average sensitivity of 96.73%, while on SARS-COV-2 CT-Scan dataset it achieves an overall accuracy and sensitivity 97.59% and 98.41% respectively.","Ibrahim, Mohamed Ramzy; Youssef, Sherin M; Fathalla, Karma M",J Ambient Intell Humaniz Comput,,424
398880,Social Capital Mediates the Relationship between Social Distancing and COVID-19 Prevalence in Japan,2021,"The outbreak of pneumonia caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) occurred in December 2019, and spread rapidly throughout the world. There have been other severe coronavirus outbreaks worldwide, namely, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV). Because the genetic diversity of coronaviruses renders the design of vaccines complicated, broad spectrum-anti-coronavirus drugs have become a critical approach to control the coronavirus epidemic. Cyclophilin A is an important protein needed for coronavirus replication, and its inhibitor cyclosporine A has the ability to suppress coronavirus on a broad spectrum. CD147-S protein was found to be one route by which SARS-CoV-2 invades host cells, while CD147 was found to play a functional role in facilitating the infection of host cells by SARS-CoV. The CyPA/CD147 interaction may play a critical role in the ability of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to enter the host cells. However, cyclosporine A has immunosuppressive effects, so the conditions for its use as an antiviral drug are limited. As a result, cyclosporine A analogues without immunosuppressive side effects have attracted lots of interest. This review primarily discusses the drug development prospects of cyclophilin A as a therapeutic target for the treatment of coronavirus infection, especially coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), and non-immunosuppressive cyclosporine analogues.","Liu, Chenglong; von Brunn, Albrecht; Zhu, Di",Med.

398881,Social Capital Mediates the Relationship between Social Distancing and COVID-19 Prevalence in Japan,2021,"Smallpox, caused by Variola virus (VARV), was eradicated in 1980; however, VARV bioterrorist threats still exist, necessitating readily available therapeutics. Current preparedness activities recognize the importance of oral antivirals and recommend therapeutics with different mechanisms of action. Monkeypox virus (MPXV) is closely related to VARV, causing a highly similar clinical human disease, and can be used as a surrogate for smallpox antiviral testing. The prairie dog MPXV model has been characterized and used to study the efficacy of antipoxvirus therapeutics, including recently approved TPOXX (tecovirimat). Brincidofovir (BCV; CMX001) has shown antiviral activity against double-stranded DNA viruses, including poxviruses. To determine the exposure of BCV following oral administration to prairie dogs, a pharmacokinetics (PK) study was performed. Analysis of BCV plasma concentrations indicated variability, conceivably due to the outbred nature of the animals. To determine BCV efficacy in the MPXV prairie dog model, groups of animals were intranasally challenged with 9 × 105 plaque-forming units (PFU; 90% lethal dose [LD90]) of MPXV on inoculation day 0 (ID0). Animals were divided into groups based on the first day of BCV treatment relative to inoculation day (ID-1, ID0, or ID1). A trend in efficacy was noted dependent upon treatment initiation (57% on ID-1, 43% on ID0, and 29% on ID1) but was lower than demonstrated in other animal models. Analysis of the PK data indicated that BCV plasma exposure (maximum concentration [C max]) and the time of the last quantifiable concentration (AUClast) were lower than in other animal models administered the same doses, indicating that suboptimal BCV exposure may explain the lower protective effect on survival.IMPORTANCE Preparedness activities against highly transmissible viruses with high mortality rates have been highlighted during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Smallpox, caused by variola virus (VARV) infection, is highly transmissible, with an estimated 30% mortality. Through an intensive vaccination campaign, smallpox was declared eradicated in 1980, and routine smallpox vaccination of individuals ceased. Today's current population has little/no immunity against VARV. If smallpox were to reemerge, the worldwide results would be devastating. Recent FDA approval of one smallpox antiviral (tecovirimat) was a successful step in biothreat preparedness; however, orthopoxviruses can become resistant to treatment, suggesting the need for multiple therapeutics. Our paper details the efficacy of the investigational smallpox drug brincidofovir in a monkeypox virus (MPXV) animal model. Since brincidofovir has not been tested in vivo against smallpox, studies with the related virus MPXV are critical in understanding whether it would be protective in the event of a smallpox outbreak.","Hutson, Christina L; Kondas, Ashley V; Mauldin, Mathew R; Doty, Jeffrey B; Grossi, Irma M; Morgan, Clint N; Ostergaard, Sharon Dietz; Hughes, Christine M; Nakazawa, Yoshinori; Kling, Chantal; Martin, Brock E; Ellison, James A; Carroll, Darin S; Gallardo-Romero, Nadia F; Olson, Victoria A",MSphere,,424

This crisis affects people in their most important, committed, and intimate relationships. Although this crisis has damaged the health and wellbeing of individuals, crushed economies, and led to an extensive period of uncertainty about the future, there may also be positive outcomes in the motivation people have to protect their relationships. In this paper, we focus on strategies that therapists and relationship educators can use to help couples preserve and protect their relationships during such a time. We describe four foundations of safety that allow relationships to thrive: physical, emotional, commitment, and community. We then highlight three keys from our body of work that can help guide individuals and couples in protecting their relationships on a day-to-day, moment-to-moment basis: 1) Decide, don't slide. 2) Make it safe to connect. 3) Do your part.","Stanley, Scott M; Markman, Howard J",Fam. process,,424

METHODS: The induction training was conducted for 3 days on malaria diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and ethics. All trainings were assessed using a pre and post-training assessment questionnaire, with 70% marks as qualifying threshold. The questionnaire was divided into three thematic areas viz. general knowledge related to malaria (KAP), diagnosis and treatment (DXRX), and vector control (PVC). RESULTS: In 2017, the project trained 330 candidates, followed by 243 and 247 candidates in 2018 and 2019, respectively. 94.3% candidates passed after a single training session. Almost all (95%) candidates showed improvement in knowledge after the training with 4% showing no effect and 1% showing deterioration. Progressive improvement in scores of 2017 cohort was seen along with significant improvement in performance of candidates in 2019 after the introduction of systematic monitoring and 'shadowing' training exercises. CONCLUSION: The project has successfully demonstrated the value of recruitment of workers from the study area, outcome of training, and performance evaluation of field staff in malaria elimination programme. This careful strategy of recruitment and training resulted in a work-force that was capable of independently conducting surveillance, case management, vector control, and Information Education Communication/Behaviour Change Communication (IEC/BCC). The learnings of this study, including the training modules and monitoring processes, can be used to train the health delivery staff for achieving national goal for malaria elimination by 2030.

However, it suggested, 'local solutions' should be sought in order to protect the delivery of cancer services. We aimed to compare surgeons' practice for the provision of colorectal (CR) cancer surgery across the United Kingdom (UK), against updated Joint Royal Colleges & ACPGBI guidelines and highlight differences in practice, if any. METHOD: An online survey was conducted. It examined surgical practice across the UK against current protocols for CR cancer surgeries, during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: 29 individual responses were received from 23 NHS Trusts across the UK. 23/29 (79%) surgeons ceased or experienced delays in their CR cancer surgeries during the pandemic, with 3/29 (10%) yet to reintroduce these services. 19/26 (73%) surgeons instructed their patients to self-isolate prior to surgery, of which 5/19 (26%) correctly enforced a duration of 14 days. 10/19 (53%) participants adhered to guidelines of performing a CT chest within 24 h of surgery. 10/26 (38%) participants believe their patients are experiencing longer hospital admissions in the COVID-19 setting. CONCLUSION: This snap shot survey highlights the dramatic variations in CR cancer surgery practice within the UK and inconsistent adherence to protocols. Guidelines will no doubt change as our knowledge of COVID-19 increases both nationally and internationally. It is essential CR surgeons keep up to date with changes in guidance, so uniformity in practice can be maintained.","Byrne, Hannah; Chawla, Aastha; Gurung, Ganga; Hughes, Gemma; Rao, Milind",Surg.

During the crisis climax, many hospitals, like the Strasbourg University Hospital, had to rely on backup from available anaesthesiologists, working in spared regions, to relieve healthcare resources and reinforce local teams. This remarkable chain of solidarity compensated for limited healthcare resources and allowed for appropriate, high-level care of severe COVID-19 patients in Strasbourg. Adequate allocation of medical resources required anticipation, reactivity and a skill-oriented dispatch from both administrative and medical perspectives. To maximise its efficacy, this system should focus on facilitating rapid integration of medical resources from abroad in ancillary tasks and ease their rapid acquisition of local protocols.

407538,The new periodontal disease classification: Level of agreement on diagnoses and treatment planning at various dental education levels,2021,"Diverse SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have been identified from bats and other animal species. Like SARS-CoV, some bat SL-CoVs, such as WIV1, also use angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) from human and bat as entry receptor. However, whether these viruses can also use the ACE2 of other animal species as their receptor remains to be determined. We report herein that WIV1 has a broader tropism to ACE2 orthologs than SARS-CoV isolate Tor2. Among the 9 ACE2 orthologs examined, human ACE2 exhibited the highest efficiency to mediate the infection of WIV1 pseudotyped virus. Our findings thus imply that WIV1 has the potential to infect a wide range of wild animals and may directly jump to humans. We also showed that cell entry of WIV1 could be restricted by interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs). However, WIV1 could exploit the airway protease TMPRSS2 to partially evade the IFITM3 restriction. Interestingly, we also found that amphotericin B could enhance the infectious entry of SARS-CoVs and SL-CoVs by evading IFITM3-mediated restriction. Collectively, our findings further underscore the risk of exposure to animal SL-CoVs and highlight the vulnerability of patients who take amphotericin B to infection by SL-CoVs, including the most recently emerging (SARS-CoV-2).","Zheng, Mei; Zhao, Xuesen; Zheng, Shuangli; Chen, Danying; Du, Pengcheng; Li, Xinglin; Jiang, Dong; Guo, Ju-Tao; Zeng, Hui; Lin, Hanxin",Emerg Microbes Infect,,424

407966,Greece ∙ Seeking Balance in Times of Emergency,2020,"INTRODUCTION: hand injuries are a common emergency mainly caused by domestic accidents or sport injuries. During the COVID-19 pandemic confinement period, with a cut off in transportation as well as in occupational and physical activities, we observed a decrease in medical and elective surgical activities but emergency cases of upper limb and hand surgery increased. MATERIALS AND METHODS: we conducted a retrospective epidemiological study to analyze two periods between the same dates in 2019 and 2020, for all the duration of the confinement period. We compared the numbers of consultations in the emergency department, elective surgeries, hand and upper limb emergency cases in our center and urgent limb surgeries in the nearby hospital. Then we compared the mechanisms and severity of injuries and the type of surgery. RESULTS: between 2019 and 2020 there was a decrease of consultations in the emergency department in our institution of 52%, a decrease of total elective surgeries of 75%, a decrease in surgeries for urgent peripheral limb injuries of 50%, whereas the hand and upper limb emergency remained stable or even increased by 4% regard to occupational and domestic accidents. There was a significant difference in the mechanism of injury with an increase of domestic accident and a decrease of occupational, road traffic and sport accidents. Severity of the injuries increased, with augmentation of the number of tissues involved and longer expected time of recovery. CONCLUSION: during the confinement period of the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an important reduction of medical activities, the amount and severity of hand emergency cases increased. A specific plan regarding duty shift organization for hand trauma should be maintained regardless of the sanitary situation.","Fortané, Thibaut; Bouyer, Michael; Le Hanneur, Malo; Belvisi, Baptiste; Courtiol, Guillaume; Chevalier, Kevin; Dainotto, Caroline; Loret, Marie; Kling, Agathe; Bentejac, Antonin; Lafosse, Thibault",Injury,,424

The CSS, a newly emerging internationally standardized measure of stress related to being exposed to or contracting COVID-19, was translated and validated for a Palestinian context to ensure that it can be used to measure COVID-19 stress. The sample of the study consisted of 860 Palestinian adults living in the West Bank of Palestine. Participants' age ranged from 20 to 48 years old (M = 34.7, SD =13.46). They were all recruited from online advertisements, e-mail campaigns, blogs, social media, and SMS campaigns. The CSS was found to be valid in the Arabic language within a Palestinian context. The confirmatory factor analysis yielded six factors: (1) Fears about the dangerousness of COVID-19, (2) fears about the personal social, and economic consequences of COVID-19, fears of disruption in the supply chain, fears of looting or rioting, (3) COVID-19-xenophobia, fears that foreigners are sources of COVID-19, (4) fears about sources of COVID-19-related contamination,(5) traumatic stress symptoms related to COVID-19, and (6) COVID-19-related checking which is consisting with the ordinal structure the scale. The CSS demonstrated a high level of validity and reliability in a Palestinian context and therefore can be considered for future studies as the COVID-19 pandemic persists. Further investigations using the Arabic Language of CSS may have far-reaching implications for measuring and combating the stress of COVID-19 at a personal and societal level for uniquely at-risk populations such as in the occupied territories of Palestine.","Mahamid, Fayez Azez; Veronese, Guido; Bdier, Dana; Pancake, Rachel",Curr Psychol,,424

Based on a mixed-effect Cox model after propensity score-matching, we found that the risk for 28-day all-cause mortality was 5.2% and 9.4% in the matched statin and non-statin groups, respectively, with an adjusted hazard ratio of 0.58. The statin use-associated lower risk of mortality was also observed in the Cox time-varying model and marginal structural model analysis. These results give support for the completion of ongoing prospective studies and randomized controlled trials involving statin treatment for COVID-19, which are needed to further validate the utility of this class of drugs to combat the mortality of this pandemic.","Zhang, Xiao-Jing; Qin, Juan-Juan; Cheng, Xu; Shen, Lijun; Zhao, Yan-Ci; Yuan, Yufeng; Lei, Fang; Chen, Ming-Ming; Yang, Huilin; Bai, Liangjie; Song, Xiaohui; Lin, Lijin; Xia, Meng; Zhou, Feng; Zhou, Jianghua; She, Zhi-Gang; Zhu, Lihua; Ma, Xinliang; Xu, Qingbo; Ye, Ping; Chen, Guohua; Liu, Liming; Mao, Weiming; Yan, Youqin; Xiao, Bing; Lu, Zhigang; Peng, Gang; Liu, Mingyu; Yang, Jun; Yang, Luyu; Zhang, Changjiang; Lu, Haofeng; Xia, Xigang; Wang, Daihong; Liao, Xiaofeng; Wei, Xiang; Zhang, Bing-Hong; Zhang, Xin; Yang, Juan; Zhao, Guang-Nian; Zhang, Peng; Liu, Peter P; Loomba, Rohit; Ji, Yan-Xiao; Xia, Jiahong; Wang, Yibin; Cai, Jingjing; Guo, Jiao; Li, Hongliang",Cell Metab,,424

Based on the available scientific evidence, it is not clear to date what is the best therapeutic strategy for the treatment of COVID-19. Since SARS-CoV-2 infection stimulates a vigorous proinflammatory response and may cause the so-called ""cytokine storm"", immunomodulator drugs have been investigated as potential treatment for severe COVID-19 pneumonia. Among immunomodulators, tocilizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody directed against IL-6 receptor, seems to be promising. An increasing number of clinical trials are exploring the role of tocilizumab in COVID-19, focusing on outcomes like mortality, risk of intensive care unit admission and the need for mechanical ventilation. At the moment, there is no conclusive evidence that tocilizumab would be proper outright in all patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, but some studies suggest that its use may be beneficial in selected categories of patients.","Bacca, Erica; Digaetano, Margherita; Meschiari, Marianna; Franceschini, Erica; Menozzi, Marianna; Cuomo, Gianluca; Mussini, Cristina",Biochem. biophys. res. commun,,424
411256,Civil Society as Policy Entrepreneur in Agriculture and Forestry sectors amidst COVID-19 lockdown in India,2021,"BACKGROUND: The high prevalence of COVID-19 has resulted in 200,000 deaths as of early 2020. The corresponding mortality rate among different countries and times varies. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to investigate the relationship between the mortality rate and prevalence of COVID-19 within a country. METHODS: We collected data from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. These data included the daily cumulative death count, recovered count, and confirmed count for each country. This study focused on a total of 36 countries with over 10,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases. Mortality was the main outcome and dependent variable, and it was computed by dividing the number of COVID-19 deaths by the number of confirmed cases. RESULTS: The results of our global panel regression analysis showed that there was a highly significant correlation between prevalence and mortality (&#961;=0.8304; P<.001). We found that every increment of 1 confirmed COVID-19 case per 1000 individuals led to a 1.29268% increase in mortality, after controlling for country-specific baseline mortality and time-fixed effects. Over 70% of excess mortality could be attributed to prevalence, and the heterogeneity among countries' mortality-prevalence ratio was significant (P<.001). Further, our results showed that China had an abnormally high and significant mortality-prevalence ratio compared to other countries (P<.001). This unusual deviation in the mortality-prevalence ratio disappeared with the removal of the data that was collected from China after February 17, 2020. It is worth noting that the prevalence of a disease relies on accurate diagnoses and comprehensive surveillance, which can be difficult to achieve due to practical or political concerns. CONCLUSIONS: The association between COVID-19 mortality and prevalence was observed and quantified as the mortality-prevalence ratio. Our results highlight the importance of constraining disease transmission to decrease mortality rates. The comparison of mortality-prevalence ratios between countries can be a powerful method for detecting, or even quantifying, the proportion of individuals with undocumented SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Lin, Sheng-Hsuan; Fu, Shih-Chen; Kao, Chu-Lan Michael",JMIR Public Health Surveill,,424

Relative to healthy donors, results showed abnormalities of 27 cell populations and an elevation of 42 cytokines, neutrophil chemo-attractants, and inflammatory components in patients. Supervised and unsupervised analyses revealed a high abundance of CD177, a specific neutrophil activation marker, contributing to the clustering of severe patients. Gene abundance correlated with high serum levels of CD177 in severe patients. Higher levels were confirmed in a second cohort and in ICU than non-ICU patients (P< 0.001). Longitudinal measurements discriminated between patients with the worst prognosis, leading to death, and those who recovered (P = 0.01). These results highlight neutrophil activation as a hallmark of severe disease and CD177 assessment as a reliable prognostic marker for routine care.","Lévy, Yves; Wiedemann, Aurélie; Hejblum, Boris P; Durand, Mélany; Lefebvre, Cécile; Surénaud, Mathieu; Lacabaratz, Christine; Perreau, Matthieu; Foucat, Emile; Déchenaud, Marie; Tisserand, Pascaline; Blengio, Fabiola; Hivert, Benjamin; Gauthier, Marine; Cervantes-Gonzalez, Minerva; Bachelet, Delphine; Laouénan, Cédric; Bouadma, Lila; Timsit, Jean-François; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Pantaleo, Giuseppe; Hocini, Hakim; Thiébaut, Rodolphe",iScience,,424

414671,"Design, Implementation and Evaluation of a Distance Learning Framework to Expedite Medical Education during COVID-19 pandemic: A Proof-of-Concept Study",2021,"BACKGROUND: Prior to COVID-19, the use of telemedicine within pediatric surgery was uncommon. To curb the spread of the virus many institutions restricted non-emergent clinic appointments, resulting in an increase in telemedicine use. We examined the value of telemedicine for patients presenting to a pediatric surgery clinic before and after COVID-19 METHODS: Perspectives and the potential value of telemedicine were assessed by surveying patients or caregivers of patients being evaluated by a general pediatric surgeon in-person prior to COVID-19 and by patients or caregivers of patients who completed a telemedicine appointment with a pediatric surgical provider during the COVID-19 period. RESULTS: The pre-COVID survey was completed by 57 respondents and the post-COVID survey by 123. Most respondents were white and were caregivers 31-40 years of age. Prior to COVID-19, only 26% were familiar with telemedicine, 25% reported traveling more than 100 miles and >50% traveled more than 40 miles for their appointment. More than 25% estimated additional travel costs of at least $30 and in 43% of households, at least one adult had to miss time from work. Following a telemedicine appointment during the COVID-19 period, 76% reported the care received as excellent, 86% were very satisfied with their care, 87% reported the appointment was less stressful for their child than an in-person appointment, and 57% would choose a telemedicine appointment in the future. CONCLUSION: For families seeking an alternative to the in-person encounter, telemedicine can provide added value over the traditional in-person encounter by reducing the burden of travel without compromising the quality of care. Telemedicine should be viewed as a viable option for pediatric surgery patients and future research directed toward optimizing the experience for patients and providers.

414691,"Treating COVID-19 Acute Severe Hypoxemic Respiratory Failure: First Case Report Utilizing Dexamethasone, Remdesivir, and Convalescent Plasma in Operation Inherent Resolve",2021,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a type of pneumonia caused by a novel coronavirus that was discovered in 2019. As of May 6, 2020, 84,407 cases and 4643 deaths have been confirmed in China. The Chinese population has expressed great concern since the COVID-19 outbreak. Meanwhile, an average of 1 billion people per day are using the Baidu search engine to find COVID-19-related health information. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this paper is to analyze web search data volumes related to COVID-19 in China. METHODS: We conducted an infodemiological study to analyze web search data volumes related to COVID-19. Using Baidu Index data, we assessed the search frequencies of specific search terms in Baidu to describe the impact of COVID-19 on public health, psychology, behaviors, lifestyles, and social policies (from February 11, 2020, to March 17, 2020). RESULTS: The search frequency related to COVID-19 has increased significantly since February 11th. Our heat maps demonstrate that citizens in Wuhan, Hubei Province, express more concern about COVID-19 than citizens from other cities since the outbreak first occurred in Wuhan. Wuhan citizens frequently searched for content related to ""medical help,"" ""protective materials,"" and ""pandemic progress."" Web searches for ""return to work"" and ""go back to school"" have increased eight-fold compared to the previous month. Searches for content related to ""closed community and remote office"" have continued to rise, and searches for ""remote office demand"" have risen by 663% from the previous quarter. Employees who have returned to work have mainly engaged in the following web searches: ""return to work and prevention measures,"" ""return to work guarantee policy,"" and ""time to return to work."" Provinces with large, educated populations (eg, Henan, Hebei, and Shandong) have been focusing on ""online education"" whereas medium-sized cities have been paying more attention to ""online medical care.""

Phytoplankton are the entrance of PBDEs entering to biotic environments from abiotic environments, while the responding mechanisms of phytoplankton to PBDEs have not been full established. Therefore, we chose the model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana in this study, by integrating whole transcriptome analysis with physiological-biochemical data, to reveal the molecular responding mechanisms of T. pseudonana to the toxicity of BDE-47. Our results indicated the changes of genes expressions correlated to the physiological-biochemical changes, and there were multiple molecular mechanisms of T. pseudonana responding to the toxicity of BDE-47: Gene expressions evidence explained the suppression of light reaction and proved the occurrence of cellular oxidative stress; In the meanwhile, up-regulations of genes in pathways involving carbon metabolisms happened, including the Calvin cycle, glycolysis, TCA cycle, fatty acid synthesis, and triacylglycerol synthesis; Lastly, DNA damage was found and three outcome including DNA repair, cell cycle arrest and programmed cell death (PCD) happened, which could finally inhibit the cell division and population growth of T. pseudonana. This study presented the most complete molecular responding mechanisms of phytoplankton cells to PBDEs, and provided valuable information of various PBDEs-sensitive genes with multiple functions for further research involving organic pollutants and phytoplankton.","Zhao, Yirong; Tang, Xuexi; Lv, Mengchen; Liu, Qian; Li, Jun; Zhang, Bihan; Li, Luying; Zhang, Xinxin; Zhao, Yan",Aquat Toxicol,,424

DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective longitudinal survey study at 2 tertiary centers. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with AI. INTERVENTION: Patient-centered questionnaire. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression Anxiety Stress Scales-21, Short Form-36, and AI self-management. RESULTS: Of 342 patients, 157 (46%) had primary AI, 109 (32%) had secondary AI, and 76 (22%) had glucocorticoid-induced AI. When compared to prepandemic, daily glucocorticoid dose and number of adrenal crises did not change. However, patients reported a higher financial impact from AI (34% vs 23%, Pâ =â 0.006) and difficulty accessing medical care (31% vs 7%, Pâ <â 0.0001) during the pandemic. A third of patients reported difficulty managing AI during the pandemic. After adjusting for duration and subtypes of AI, younger patients [odds ratio (OR) 2.3, CI 95% 1.3-4.1], women (OR 3.7, CI 95% 1.9-7.1), poor healthcare access(OR 4.2, CI 95% 2.3-7.7), lack of good insurance support (OR 2.8, CI 95% 1.3-5.9), and those with a higher financial impact (OR 2.3, CI 95% 1.3-4.3) reported greater difficulties managing AI. Patients were more likely to report a higher anxiety score (&#8805;8) if they found managing AI challenging during the pandemic (OR 3.0, CI 95% 1.3-6.9), and had lower Physical Component Summary (OR 4.9, CI 95% 2.2-11.0) and Mental Component Summary (OR 4.1, CI 95% 1.8-9.5) scores prior to the pandemic.

Currently, no specific drugs for COVID-19 are available, but many antiviral agents have been authorised by several national agencies. Most of them are under investigation in both preclinical and clinical trials; however, pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies are needed to identify the most suitable dose to achieve the desired effect on SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the efforts of the scientific community have focused on the screening of therapies able to counteract the most severe effects of the infection, as well as on the search of sensitive and selective analytical methods for drug detection in biological matrices, both fluids and tissues. In the last decade, many analytical methods have been proposed for the detection and quantification of antiviral compounds currently being tested for COVID-19 treatment. In this review, a critical discussion on the overall analytical procedure is provided, i.e (a) sample pre-treatment and extraction methods such as protein precipitation (PP), solid-phase extraction (SPE), liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) and QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe), (b) detection and quantification methods such as potentiometry, spectrofluorimetry and mass spectrometry (MS) as well as (c) methods including a preliminary separation step, such as high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE) coupled to UV-Vis or MS detection. Further current trends, advantages and disadvantages and prospects of these methods have been discussed, to help the analytical advances in reducing the harm caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.","Acquavia, Maria A; Foti, Luca; Pascale, Raffaella; Nicolò, Antonia; Brancaleone, Vincenzo; Cataldi, Tommaso R I; Martelli, Giuseppe; Scrano, Laura; Bianco, Giuliana",Talanta,,424

Within the nation's marginalized category, it is women who have suffered most forms of oppression. Having held a subordinate position to their male counterparts within the gender hierarchy, Indian women since the colonial times have had to bear systemic oppression at the hands of the state, caste, class, gender, and religious hegemons. During the pandemic, for women such forms of subordination were followed by socioeconomic uncertainties resulting from the economic shutdown, loss of jobs, and labor oppressions. Gender disparities resulting from class, caste and minority marginalization during the pandemic crisis have further widened the socio-cultural, economic, and political inequalities within the country.

419369,Coronavirus and Immigration Detention in Europe: The Short Summer of Abolitionism?,2021,"Monocyte homing to the liver and adhesion to the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are key elements in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) pathogenesis. We reported previously that VCAM-1 mediates monocyte adhesion to LSECs. However, the pathogenic role of VCAM-1 in NASH is unclear. Herein, we report that VCAM-1 was a top upregulated adhesion molecule in the NASH mouse liver transcriptome. Open chromatin landscape profiling combined with genome-wide transcriptome analysis showed robust transcriptional upregulation of LSEC VCAM-1 in murine NASH. Moreover, LSEC VCAM-1 expression was significantly increased in human NASH. LSEC VCAM-1 expression was upregulated by palmitate treatment in vitro and reduced with inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein 3 kinase (MAP3K) mixed lineage kinase 3 (MLK3). Likewise, LSEC VCAM-1 expression was reduced in the Mlk3-/- mice with diet-induced NASH. Furthermore, VCAM-1 neutralizing Ab or pharmacological inhibition attenuated diet-induced NASH in mice, mainly via reducing the proinflammatory monocyte hepatic population as examined by mass cytometry by time of flight (CyTOF).

420294,COVID-19 policy response and the rise of the sub-national governments,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has been predominantly a respiratory manifestation. Currently, with evolving literature, neurological signs are being increasingly recognized. Studies have reported that SARS-CoV-2 affects all aspects of the nervous system including the central nervous system (CNS), peripheral nervous system (PNS) and the muscular system as well. Not all patients have reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction positive for the virus in the cerebrospinal fluid, and diagnosing the association of the virus with the myriad of neurological manifestations can be a challenge. It is important that clinicians have a high-index of suspicion for COVID-19 in patients presenting with new-onset neurological symptoms. This will lead to early diagnosis and specific management. Further studies are desired to unravel the varied neurological manifestations, treatment, outcome and long-term sequel in COVID-19 patients.","Sachdev, Kirti; Agrawal, Sumita; Ish, Pranav; Gupta, Nitesh; Raheja, Kapil",Indian J Med Res,,424
420295,COVID-19 Policy Response and the Rise of the Sub-National Governments,2020,"BACKGROUND: Studies on medication-related problems (MRPs) among pregnant women are scarce, despite the potential consequences for both mother and child. This study aimed to describe the prevalence, clinical significance, and risk factors for MRPs among hospitalized pregnant or postpartum women at Jimma University Medical Centre (JUMC) in Ethiopia. METHODS: A prospective follow-up and clinical audit of 1117 hospitalized pregnant or postpartum women in the maternity and gynaecology wards at JUMC was carried out between February and June 2017. Patients were followed throughout their stay in the hospital to assess the presence and development of MRPs. Pre-tested data extraction form and an interview-guided structured questionnaire were used to collect data. Descriptive statistics were used to describe MRPs. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated with MRPs. RESULTS: One or more MRPs occurred among 323 (28.9%) study participants, mostly in relation to lack of iron supplementation. A total of 278 (70.6%) of all MRPs were considered to be of moderate to high clinical significance. When excluding MRPs due to iron from the analysis, chronic disease (adjusted OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.02, 3.58), medication use prior to admission (adjusted OR 2.38; 95% CI 1.24, 4.56), nulliparity (adjusted OR 1.99; 95% CI 1.22, 3.24) and multiparity (adjusted OR 1.91; 95% CI 1.17, 3.12) were significantly associated with experiencing an MRP. CONCLUSIONS: Nearly 3 out of 10 hospitalized pregnant women at JUMC had one or more MRPs. The need for additional iron therapy was by far the most common type of MRP. Improved adherence to guidelines on iron supplementation are required. Multidisciplinary approaches including physicians, nurses, anesthesia professionals and clinical pharmacists in the maternity and gynaecology wards could possibly prevent MRPs and promote patient safety for women and children.","Ahmed, Seid Mussa; Sundby, Johanne; Aragaw, Yesuf Ahmed; Nordeng, Hedvig",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,,424

The objective of this review is to examine the adaptations of psychiatric care in France during this pandemic. METHOD: This narrative review is based on the observation of changes made in French psychiatric hospitals and on an analysis of the literature. RESULTS: Regarding psychiatric hospitalization, the COVID-19 epidemic required rapid measures that profoundly modified the conditions of patients' reception, forcing the medical staffs to adapt their methods of care. The authors noted the creation of at least 89 wards specifically dedicated to patients with COVID-19 needing psychiatric hospitalization, allowing dual care of general medicine and psychiatry. Regarding ambulatory care, maintaining patients with long-term follow-up was a priority. Patients recalling and teleconsultation have been precious resources but cannot entirely replace face-to-face consultations. DISCUSSION: COVID-19 epidemic created unprecedented situation of large-scale upheavals in the healthcare system and in society. Despite the absence of previous recommendations on the subject, French psychiatry has shown great adaptability. Some changes could inspire post-COVID-19 care.","Bocher, R; Jansen, C; Gayet, P; Gorwood, P; Laprévote, V",Encephale,,424

We hypothesized interactions between epigenetic processes, inflammatory response and gut microbiota with family surroundings or environmental characteristics. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We searched in literature interactions between epigenetic processes and psychiatric disorders with a special interest for environmental factors such as traumatic or stress events, family relationships and also gut microbiota. We searched on Pubmed, PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES and Sciencedirect articles with the keywords psychiatric disorders, epigenome, microbiome and family relationships. RESULTS: Some gene polymorphisms interact with negative environment and lead to psychiatric disorders. Negative environment is correlated with different epigenetic modifications in genes implicated in mental health. Gut microbiota diversity affect host epigenetic. Animal studies showed evidences for a transgenerational transmission of epigenetic characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the hypothesis that epigenetic mediate gene-environment interactions and psychiatric disorders. Several environmental characteristics such as traumatic life events, family adversity, psychological stress or internal environment such as gut microbiota diversity and diet showed an impact on epigenetic. These epigenetic modifications are also correlated with neurophysiological, inflammatory or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulations.","Dubois, Thomas; Reynaert, Christine; Jacques, Denis; Lepiece, Brice; Zdanowicz, Nicolas",Psychiatr Danub,,424

428389,"Government capacity, societal trust or party preferences: what accounts for the variety of national policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe?",2021,"Introduction: the COVID-19 pandemic, which results from infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), presents important diagnostic challenges. Diagnostic strategies available to identify or rule out current infection, or to identify people in need of care escalation, or to test for past infection and immune response have become available, to reduce household and community transmission. We highlight a Cochrane review, published in September 2020, on the assessment of diagnostic accuracy of point-of-care antigen and molecular-based tests to determine current SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: the authors of the Cochrane review searched multiple electronic databases for studies, which assessed SARS-CoV-2 infection with a diagnostic test. Eligible participants for the review included people with suspected current SARS-CoV-2 infection, known to have, or not to have COVID-19 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection. Results: the authors included 18 studies of point-of-care tests conducted in various parts of the world, with none from Africa. The review shows that there is considerable variability in sensitivity and specificity of the antigen tests. The review also shows that molecular tests had less variability in sensitivity and specificity. Conclusion: the review suggests that the current evidence is not strong enough to determine the usefulness of point-of-care tests in all settings. However, the benefits are likely to be more noticeable in countries, like Africa where community transmission is high. An impact evaluation would be warranted when rapid point-of-care tests are implemented in African countries.","Ndwandwe, Duduzile; Mathebula, Lindi; Kamadjeu, Raoul; Wiysonge, Charles Shey",Pan Afr Med J,,424
429590,Factors Associated to Hospital Admission in a Care Protocol in COVID-19,2020,"ABSTRACT: To assess tocilizumab (TCZ) efficacy associated to standard of care (SOC) compared to SOC alone in severe coronavirus associated disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. In a matched case-control study from 3 French Hospital COVID-19 Departments, 27 patients with severe COVID-19 treated with TCZ and SOC were matched for baseline epidemiological and clinical features and compared to 27 severe COVID-19 patients treated with SOC alone. Baseline characteristics of the study population were comparable between groups. Eleven patients (20%) died. TCZ was not associated with clinical improvement as compared to SOC regarding oxygen-free status (44% vs 63%) and death (18.5% vs 22%), despite a higher decrease of the C-reactive protein at Day 7 (10.7 vs 52âmg/L; Pâ<â10-3). Compared to the 43 patients alive at the end-of follow-up, patients who died were older (78 vs 64âyears; Pâ<â10-3), with 82% of them older than 72âyears vs only 23% of live patients (Pâ<â10-3). Age (ORâ=â1.15; 95%CIâ=â1.04-1.3; Pâ=â.008) and age over 72âyears (OR)â=â14.85; 95%CIâ=â2.7-80; Pâ=â.002) were independently associated with mortality. TCZ in addition to SOC for severe COVID-19 patients did not reduce mortality, subsequent need for invasive mechanical ventilation nor did it shorten the time of oxygen support, despite better control of the inflammatory response. More powerful and randomized controlled trials are warranted to determine if TCZ is effective in the management of COVID-19.","Burlacu, Ruxandra; London, Jonathan; Fleury, Audrey; Sené, Thomas; Diallo, Abdourahmane; Meyssonnier, Vanina; Zeller, Valérie; Galland, Joris; Huscenot, Tessa; Rubenstein, Emma; Trouiller, Pierre; Amathieu, Roland; Kutter, Johannes; Blondeel, David; Lejour, Gabriel; Mouly, Stéphane; Lidove, Olivier; Wladimir, Mauhin; Sène, Damien",Medicine (Baltimore),,424

This study aimed to assess the exposure health risks of COVID-19 among frontline healthcare workers in the Amhara region, Ethiopia. METHOD: A web-based cross-sectional study was conducted on public health workers from May to August 2020. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire via email and telegram services. Both descriptive statistics and bivariate followed by multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify distribution patterns and factors associated with exposure risks to COVID-19. Odds ratio with 95% Confidence Interval (CI), and a P-value of <0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. RESULT: A total of 418 health care workers participated in the study with a response rate of 99.1%. The majority of the study participants 310(74.2%), were males, and 163(39%) were nurses/ midwives respectively. More than half of the respondents 237(56.7%), had reported that they didn`t have face-to-face contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient. Among the respondents, 173(41.4%), 147(35.2%), 63(15.1%), and 65(15.6%) of the health professionals had always used gloves, medical masks, face shield, or goggles/protective glasses, and disposable gown, respectively. In this study, age between 25-34 years (AOR = 0.20), age between 35-44 years (AOR = 0.13), family size of >6 (AOR = 3.77), work experience of 21-30 years (AOR = 0.01), and good handwashing habit (AOR = 0.44) were the protective factors against COVID-19. On the other hand, perception of non-exposure to COVD 19 (AOR = 9.56), and poor habit of decontamination of high touch areas (AOR = 2.52) were the risk factors associated with confirmed COVID 19 cases among health care workers. CONCLUSION: Poor adherence to personal protective equipment use and aseptic practices during and after health care interactions with patients were identified. Strategies should be implemented to institute effective and sustainable infection control measures that protect the health care workers from COVID-19 infection.","Atnafie, Seyfe Asrade; Anteneh, Demssie Ayalew; Yimenu, Dawit Kumilachew; Kifle, Zemene Demelash",PLoS One,,424
430056,Features,2020,"Pulmonary lobe segmentation in computed tomography scans is essential for regional assessment of pulmonary diseases. Recent works based on convolution neural networks have achieved good performance for this task. However, they are still limited in capturing structured relationships due to the nature of convolution. The shape of the pulmonary lobes affect each other and their borders relate to the appearance of other structures, such as vessels, airways, and the pleural wall. We argue that such structural relationships play a critical role in the accurate delineation of pulmonary lobes when the lungs are affected by diseases such as COVID-19 or COPD. In this paper, we propose a relational approach (RTSU-Net) that leverages structured relationships by introducing a novel non-local neural network module. The proposed module learns both visual and geometric relationships among all convolution features to produce self-attention weights. With a limited amount of training data available from COVID-19 subjects, we initially train and validate RTSU-Net on a cohort of 5000 subjects from the COPDGene study (4000 for training and 1000 for evaluation). Using models pre-trained on COPDGene, we apply transfer learning to retrain and evaluate RTSU-Net on 470 COVID-19 suspects (370 for retraining and 100 for evaluation). Experimental results show that RTSU-Net outperforms three baselines and performs robustly on cases with severe lung infection due to COVID-19.","Xie, Weiyi; Jacobs, Colin; Charbonnier, Jean-Paul; Ginneken, Bram van",,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07443v4.pdf,424

Patients were stratified according to hemoglobin level into two groups, that is, Hb <100 g/L and Hb >100 g/L. A total of 6931 patients were included. Of these, 6377 (92%) patients had hemoglobin levels >100 g/L. The mean age was 44 ± 17 years, and 66% of the patients were males. The median length of overall hospital stay was 13 days [2; 31]. The remaining 554 (8%) patients had a hemoglobin level <100 g/L. Overall mortality was 176 patients (2.54%) but was significantly higher in the group with hemoglobin levels <100 g/L (124, 22.4%) than in the group with hemoglobin levels >100 g/L (52, 0.82%). Risk factors associated with increased mortality were determined by multivariate analysis. The Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed hemoglobin as a predictor of mortality. Cox proportional hazards regression coefficients for hemoglobin for the HB &#8804; 100 category of hemoglobin were significant, B = 2.79, SE = 0.17, and HR = 16.34, p < 0.001.

The study population was comprised of 552 patients. All patients were consulted and advised by telephone as regards the prophylaxis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Hospital and outpatient follow-ups were limited to the minimum. Preventive modification of immunosuppression was not recommended in relation to the pandemic. Three patients with multiple comorbidities (a woman aged 60, a man aged 59, and another man aged 83; 2.25 years, 5.5 years, and 7.5 years after heart transplantation, respectively) and one patient with concomitant arterial hypertension (a woman aged 48, 5.5 years after heart transplantation) presented with a symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Three of the patients were on tacrolimus immunosuppression, and both female patients were additionally on therapy with mycophenolate mofetil, which was discontinued following the diagnosis of infection. One male patient received combined therapy of cyclosporine A and mycophenolate mofetil. The 60-year-old woman presented with gastrointestinal manifestations of the COVID-19 infection which were of moderate severity. The recovery was achieved. The 59-year-old man presented with myocardial infarction, exacerbated renal insufficiency that required hemodialysis and cardiorespiratory failure complicated by bacterial sepsis. As a result, the patient died. The 83-year-old male patient reporting fever, myalgia, fatigue, cough and dyspnea was admitted to hospital and deceased due to septic shock two days after admission. The 48-year old woman who presented with mild symptoms of the upper respiratory tract infection recovered after two weeks. Symptomatic treatment was used in all the patients. Another male patient (aged 45 years, 8 years after orthotopic heart transplant with no significant comorbidities) was an asymptomatic carrier of SARS-CoV-2 and remained under hospital care.

434817,"Assessing Communication Behaviours of Hospital Pharmacists: How Well Do the Perspectives of Pharmacists, Patients, and an Independent Observer Align?",2020,"BACKGROUND: Early reports associating SARS-CoV-2 infection with adverse pregnancy outcomes were biased by including only women with severe disease without controls. The Society for Obstetric Anesthesia and Perinatology (SOAP) COVID Registry was created to compare peripartum outcomes and anesthetic utilization in women with and without SARS-CoV-2 infection delivering at institutions with widespread testing. METHODS: Deliveries from 14 U.S. medical centers, March 19-May 31, 2020, were included. Peripartum infection was defined as a positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test within 14 days of delivery. Consecutive SARS-CoV-2 infected patients with randomly selected control patients were sampled (1:2 ratio) with controls delivering during the same day without a positive test. Outcomes were obstetric (e.g., delivery mode, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, delivery < 37 weeks), an adverse neonatal outcome composite measure (primary), and anesthetic utilization (e.g., neuraxial labor analgesia and anesthesia). Outcomes were analyzed using generalized estimating equations to account for clustering within centers. Sensitivity analyses compared symptomatic and asymptomatic patients to controls. RESULTS: 1454 peripartum women were included: 490 with SARS-CoV-2 infection [176 (35.9%) symptomatic]; 964 controls. SARS-CoV-2 patients were slightly younger, more likely non-nulliparous, non-white, and Hispanic than controls. They were more likely to have diabetes, obesity, or cardiac disease and less likely to have autoimmune disease. After adjustment for confounders, individuals experiencing SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited an increased risk for delivery < 37 weeks gestation compared to controls, 73 (14.8%) vs. 98 (10.2%) [adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.47 95% CI (1.03-2.09)]. Effect estimates for other obstetric outcomes and the neonatal composite outcome measure were not meaningfully different between SARS-CoV-2-patients versus controls. In sensitivity analyses, compared to controls, symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients exhibited: increases in cesarean delivery [aOR: 1.57 95% CI (1.09-2.27)]; postpartum length of stay [aOR 1.89 95% CI (1.18-2.60)]; delivery < 37 weeks gestation [aOR 2.08 95% CI (1.29-3.36)]. These adverse outcomes were not found in asymptomatic women versus controls. SARS-CoV-2 patients (asymptomatic and symptomatic) were less likely to receive neuraxial labor analgesia [aOR: 0.52 95% CI (0.35-0.75)] and more likely to receive general anesthesia for cesarean delivery [aOR: 3.69 95% CI (1.40-9.74)] due to maternal respiratory failure. CONCLUSIONS: In this large, multicenter U.S. cohort study of women with and without peripartum SARS-CoV-2 infection, differences in obstetric and neonatal outcomes seem to be mostly driven by symptomatic patients. Lower utilization of neuraxial analgesia in laboring patients with asymptomatic or symptomatic infection compared to patients without infection requires further investigation.","Katz, Daniel; Bateman, Brian T; Kjaer, Klaus; Turner, Dana P; Spence, Nicole Z; Habib, Ashraf S; George, Ronald B; Toledano, Roulhac D; Grant, Gilbert; Madden, Hannah E; Butwick, Alex J; Lynde, Grant; Minehart, Rebecca D; Beilin, Yaakov; Houle, Timothy T; Sharpe, Emily E; Kodali, Bhavani; Bharadwaj, Shobana; Farber, Michaela K; Palanisamy, Arvind; Prabhu, Malavika; Gonzales, Nikolai Y; Landau, Ruth; Leffert, Lisa",,,424

435199,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on pharmacy education in Kuwait,2020,"The purpose of this article is to report the experience of the Department of Hospital Pharmacy of a mid-size hospital during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. The human and material resources available in a mid-size hospital were more limited than in larger hospitals of the region. In this article, we describe how this Department of Hospital Pharmacy was reorganized to meet the increase in activity, the strategies developed and the lessons learned for future pandemics. The COVID-19 pandemic had a higher impact in Leganes, a city in the south of Madrid, with a population of 190,000. In the face of the dramatic increase in the proportion of patients attending our hospital between March and April 2020, the Severo Ochoa University Hospital increased the number of beds by 24.5% and fitted out new premises inside and outside the hospital (sports centers). The mean number of patients seen in our Emergency Department every day passed from 70-80 to a peak of 286 patients, with 652 hospitalized patients. The situation of emergency created by this infectious disease, with management protocols changing constantly, had a dramatic impact on the activity of hospital pharmacies. Thus, the pandemic has affected areas of economic management, magistral preparation, dispensing of medication to inpatients, ambulatory patients, patients monitored at home, institutionalized patients, and patients from private hospitals and field hospitals. Other areas affected include training, clinical trials, pharmacovigilance, and counseling boards. Two strategies were adopted to overcome these problems: a strategy centered on human resources (staff reinforcement, reallocation of responsibilities), and a strategy centered on processes (some processes were reinforced to meet the increase in activity, whereas other were temporarily suspended or reduced to the minimum).Conclusions: The Department of Hospital Pharmacy plays a key role in hospitals and has been significantly reinforced to meet the dramatic impact of the pandemic on this service. This Department has been able to reorganize its processes and take over new responsibilities such as telepharmacy and home dispensing. Hospital pharmacies play a crucial role in pharmacotherapeutic decisions in hospitals. As in other Departments, training is the area more significantly affected by the pandemic.","Corregidor-Luna, Laura; Hidalgo-Correas, Francisco J; García-Díaz, Benito",Farm Hosp,,424

Minimizando la dispersión./ Noninvasive mechanical ventilation and COVID-19. Minimizing dispersion,2020,"During the current COVID-19 pandemic, the global ratio between the dead and the survivors is approximately 1 to 10, which has put humanity on high alert and provided strong motivation for the intensive search for vaccines and drugs. It is already clear that if we follow the most likely scenario, which is similar to that used to create seasonal influenza vaccines, then we will need to develop improved vaccine formulas every year to control the spread of the new, highly mutable coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. In this article, using well-known RNA viruses (HIV, influenza viruses, HCV) as examples, we consider the main successes and failures in creating primarily highly effective vaccines. The experience accumulated dealing with the biology of zoonotic RNA viruses suggests that the fight against COVID-19 will be difficult and lengthy. The most effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 will be those able to form highly effective memory cells for both humoral (memory B cells) and cellular (cross-reactive antiviral memory T cells) immunity. Unfortunately, RNA viruses constantly sweep their tracks and perhaps one of the most promising solutions in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic is the creation of 'universal' vaccines based on conservative SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (antigen-presenting) and unmethylated CpG dinucleotides (adjuvant) in the composition of the phosphorothioate backbone of single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides (ODN), which can be effective for long periods of use. Here, we propose a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine based on a lasso-like phosphorothioate oligonucleotide construction containing CpG motifs and the antigen-presenting unique ACG-containing genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2. We found that CpG dinucleotides are the most rare dinucleotides in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 and other known human coronaviruses, and hypothesized that their higher frequency could be responsible for the unwanted increased lethality to the host, causing a 'cytokine storm' in people who overexpress cytokines through the activation of specific Toll-like receptors in a manner similar to TLR9-CpG ODN interactions. Interestingly, the virus strains sequenced in China (Wuhan) in February 2020 contained on average one CpG dinucleotide more in their genome than the later strains from the USA (New York) sequenced in May 2020. Obviously, during the first steps of the microevolution of SARS-CoV-2 in the human population, natural selection tends to select viral genomes containing fewer CpG motifs that do not trigger a strong innate immune response, so the infected person has moderate symptoms and spreads SARS-CoV-2 more readily. However, in our opinion, unmethylated CpG dinucleotides are also capable of preparing the host immune system for the coronavirus infection and should be present in SARS-CoV-2 vaccines as strong adjuvants.","Oberemok, V V; Laikova, K V; Yurchenko, K A; Marochkin, N A; Fomochkina, I I; Kubyshkin, A V",Inflamm Res,,424

DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model reflecting local practices for LTBI treatment. SETTING: A remote Canadian arctic community with a high incidence of TB. PARTICIPANTS: Hypothetical patients with LTBI. INTERVENTIONS: The cost effectiveness of 3HP was compared with the existing standard of care in the study region which consists of 9 months of twice weekly isoniazid (9H) given by directly observed therapy. OUTCOME MEASURES: Effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with model parameters were derived from historical programmatic data, a local implementation study of 3HP and published literature. Costs from the perspective of the Nunavut healthcare system were measured in 2019 US dollars and were obtained primarily from local, empirically collected data. Secondary health outcomes included estimated TB cases and TB deaths averted using 3HP versus 9H. One way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: The 3HP regimen was dominant over 9H: costs were lower (US$628 vs US$924/person) and health outcomes slightly improved (20.14 vs 20.13 QALYs/person). In comparison to 9H, 3HP treatment resulted in fewer TB cases (27.89 vs 30.16/1000 persons) and TB deaths (2.29 vs 2.48/1000 persons). 3HP completion, initiation and risk of fatal adverse events were the primary drivers of cost effectiveness. CONCLUSION: In a remote Canadian arctic setting, using 3HP instead of 9H for LTBI treatment may result in cost savings and similar or improved health outcomes.","Pease, Christopher; Alvarez, Gonzalo; Mallick, Ranjeeta; Patterson, Mike; Finn, Sandy; Habis, Yahya; Schwartzman, Kevin; Kilabuk, Elaine; Mulpuru, Sunita; Zwerling, Alice",BMJ Open,,424

METHODS: From 5/15-6/1/2020, Bhutanese and Burmese refugee community leaders were invited to complete an anonymous, online survey and shared the link with other community members who were English-proficient, &#8805;18 years old, and currently living in the USA. We identified characteristics associated with pandemic-related discrimination and stress applying ordinal logistic regression models. RESULTS: Among 218 refugees from 23 states, nearly one third of participants reported experiencing at least one type of discrimination, and more than two-thirds experienced at least one type of pandemic-related stress. Having had COVID-19, having a family member with COVID-19, and being an essential worker were associated with discrimination. Discrimination, financial crisis, and female gender were associated with stress. CONCLUSIONS: Reducing pandemic-related discrimination should remain a priority, as should the promotion of social support and coping strategies. Noting that this is a nonrepresentative sample, we recommend that larger national studies tracking experiences with pandemic-related discrimination and stress include Asian American subgroups with limited English proficiency.","Zhang, Mengxi; Gurung, Ashok; Anglewicz, Philip; Baniya, Kalpana; Yun, Katherine",J. racial ethnic health disparities (Internet),,424

442020,COVID-19 pandemic and unemployment dynamics in European economies,2021,"During a pandemic, primary care is the first line of defense. It is able to reinforce public health messages, help patients manage at home, and identify those in need of hospital care. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, primary care scrambled to rapidly transform itself and protect clinicians, staff, and patients while remaining connected to patients. Using the established public health framework for addressing a pandemic, we describe the actions primary care needs to take in a pandemic. Recommended actions are based on observed experiences of the authors' primary care practices and networks. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, tasks focused on promoting physical distancing and encouraging patients with suspected illness or exposure to self-quarantine. Testing was not available and contract tracing was not possible. As the pandemic spread, in-person care was converted to virtual care using telehealth. Practices remained connected to patients using registries to reach out to those at risk for infection, with uncontrolled chronic conditions, or were socially vulnerable. Practices managed most patients with suspected COVID-19 at home. As the pandemic decelerates, practices are now preparing to address the direct and indirect consequences-complications from COVID-19 infections, missed treatment for acute problems, inadequate prevention, uncontrolled chronic disease, mental illness, and greater social needs. Throughout, practices bore tremendous financial burden, laying off staff or even closing at a time when most needed. Primary care must learn from this experience and be ready for the next pandemic.

Revealing Students' Perspective,2020,"Background: COVID-19 may induce endovascular injury of pulmonary vessels and could be associated with increased risk of pulmonary embolism. The main objective was to compare the incidence of pulmonary embolism in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) related to COVID-19 versus patients with pulmonary ARDS unrelated to COVID-19. Methods: This is an observational controlled-cohort study performed at a single center of a university teaching hospital in France. The incidence of pulmonary embolism was prospectively assessed using computed tomography pulmonary angiography (CTPA) in patients with ARDS related to COVID-19 and compared to patients from a 3-year historical cohort of patients with pulmonary ARDS unrelated to COVID-19. In patients with ARDS related to COVID-19, CTPA was performed approximately 7 days after intubation or earlier in case of respiratory or hemodynamic worsening. Results: CTPA was performed in 29 out of the 42 patients (69%) with ARDS related to COVID-19 and in 51 out of the 156 patients (33%) from the historical cohort of patients with pulmonary ARDS unrelated to COVID-19. Incidence of pulmonary embolism was 40% (17/42) in patients with ARDS related to COVID-19 and 3% (5/156) in the historical cohort (P=0.001). The proportion of patients with pulmonary embolism among all patients who had CTPA was 59% (17/29) in patients with ARDS related to COVID-19 and 10% (5/51) in the historical cohort (P=0.0001). After adjustment on the interval between ICU admission and computed tomography, COVID-19 remained independently associated with pulmonary embolism. Conclusions: Pulmonary embolism was particularly frequent in patients with ARDS related to COVID-19, thereby suggesting that CTPA should be systematically performed in these patients.","De Roubin, V.; Reynaud, F.; Coudroy, R.; Rodriguez, M.; Monseau, G.; Joly, F.; Bardin, J.; Boissier, F.; Chatellier, D.; Veinstein, A.; Robert, R.; Frat, J.

We studied two single-point mutations at an equivalent site in the skeletal (RyR1 R164C) and cardiac (RyR2 R176Q) isoforms using ryanodine binding, Ca2+ imaging, and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of the full-length protein. Loss of the positive charge had greater effect on the skeletal isoform, mediated via distortion of a salt bridge network, a molecular latch inducing rotation of a cytoplasmic domain, and partial progression to open-state traits of the large cytoplasmic assembly accompanied by alteration of the Ca2+ binding site, which concur with the major ""hyperactive"" feature of the mutated channel. Our cryo-EM studies demonstrated the allosteric effect of a mutation situated ~85 Å away from the pore and identified an isoform-specific structural effect.","Iyer, Kavita A; Hu, Yifan; Nayak, Ashok R; Kurebayashi, Nagomi; Murayama, Takashi; Samsó, Montserrat",Sci.

446859,The impact of COVID-19 on RMO medical education and training at CDHB,2020,"While prompt diagnosis of vasculitis is important, recognition of vasculitis mimics is equally essential. As in the case of vasculitis, an approach to mimics based on the anatomic size of vessels can be useful. Infections can mimic vasculitis of any vessel size, including the formation of aneurysms and induction of ANCAs. Genetic disorders and vasculopathies are important considerations in large and medium vessel vasculitis. Cholesterol emboli, thrombotic conditions and calciphylaxis typically affect the medium and small vessels and, like vasculitis, can cause cutaneous, renal and CNS manifestations. Reversible cerebral vasoconstriction syndrome is important to distinguish from primary angiitis of the CNS. As an incorrect diagnosis of vasculitis can result in harmful consequences, it is imperative that the evaluation of suspected vasculitis includes consideration of mimics. We discuss the above mimics and outline a systematic and practical approach for differentiating vasculitis from its mimics.","Maningding, Ernest; Kermani, Tanaz A",Rheumatology (Oxford),,424

Unlike existing social network models, in this paper, a novel model of opinion dynamics is proposed, which describes the evolution of the individuals' opinions not only depends on its own and neighbors' current opinions, but also depends on past opinions. Memory and memoryless communication rules are simultaneously established for the proposed opinion dynamics model. Sufficient and/or necessary conditions for the equal polarization, consensus and neutralizability of the opinions are respectively presented in terms of the network topological structure and the spectral analysis. We apply our model to simulate Kahneman's seminal experiments on choices in risky and riskless contexts, which fits in with the experiment results.

COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, and common clinical symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, headache, and fatigue. Myocardial injury is relatively common in patients with COVID-19, accounting for 7%-23% of cases, and is associated with a higher rate of morbidity and mortality. There is a discrepancy in the literature about myocarditis as the etiology of myocardial injury in patients with COVID-19; although many anecdotal reports of myocarditis have been noted, there are only a handful of case reports in the literature about myocarditis related to COVID-19. In this review we summarize the most up to date literature around the association between COVID-19 and myocarditis and provide clinicians a practical framework about the clinical manifestations, diagnostic tools, and treatment options currently available. Importantly, this review will heighten suspicion for myocarditis as an etiology of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients, therefore improving clinical outcomes and encouraging shared clinical decision-making. This will also open the door for further research to build around this review. Emergent treatment options for COVID-19 are in clinical trials and might be of benefit to COVID-19 patients with myocarditis in addition to current guideline-based recommendations.","Pirzada, Ashar; Mokhtar, Ahmed T.; Moeller, Andrew D.",CJC Open,,424
448288,Exploring Undergraduate Students’ Attitudes towards Emergency Online Learning during COVID-19: A Case from the UAE,2020,"BACKGROUND Existing research evidence indicates that breast cancer patients have different degrees of cognitive dysfunction after chemotherapy, and polymorphisms in 3 genes (catechol-O-methyltransferase, COMT; apolipoprotein E, APOE; and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF) have been associated with cognitive impairment. However, the role of these 3 gene polymorphisms in modulating cognitive impairment in breast cancer survivors with varying hormonal receptor expression is not clear at present. To explore the effects of genetic polymorphisms in BDNF, APOE, and COMT on the regulation of prospective memory impairments induced by chemotherapy in breast cancer patients with various expression levels of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR). MATERIAL AND METHODS A total of 232 patients with breast cancer (113 with ER-/PR- and 119 with ER+/PR+) were evaluated before and after chemotherapy for cognitive function, including prospective memory. Following previously published sequencing procedures, we assessed 6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including BDNF (rs6265), APOE (rs429358, rs7412), and COMT (rs165599, rs4680, rs737865). RESULTS The patients showed poorer prospective memory scores after chemotherapy than before chemotherapy. Furthermore, the ER-/PR- group showed poorer event-based prospective memory (EBPM) scores than the ER+/PR+ group (z=-7.831, p<0.01) after chemotherapy. The patients with the COMT rs737865G/G genotype, compared with those with the A/A and A/G genotypes, showed a linear EBPM performance (ß=1.499, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.017~2.211) and were less likely to have memory impairment. In contrast, APOE and BDNF polymorphisms did not influence cognitive performance. CONCLUSIONS The patterns of hormonal receptor expression may be related to prospective memory impairments induced by chemotherapy in breast cancer patients. Furthermore, the COMT polymorphism (rs737865) was linearly related to the extent of deficits in EBPM and may represent a potential genetic marker of risk for cognitive deficits triggered by chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer.","Li, Wen; Zhao, Jingjing; Ding, Ke; Chao, Herta H; Li, Chiang-Shan R; Cheng, Huaidong; Shen, Li",Med Sci Monit,,424

Conclusion: Results indicated that the recommended herbal formulation not only modulated the pathways involved in boosting the immunity but also modulated the multiple pathways that are contributing to the progression of multiple disease pathogenesis which would add the beneficial effect in the co-morbid patients of hypertension and diabetes. The study provides the scientific documentation of the role of the Ayurvedic formulation to combat COVID-19.","Khanal, Pukar; Duyu, Taaza; Patil, B M; Dey, Yadu Nandan; Pasha, Ismail; Wanjari, Manish; Gurav, Shailendra S; Maity, Arindam",,,424
453650,Students' perception of online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic: A survey study of Polish medical students,2021,"In Brief Over the past decades, rapid advancements in computer technology, robotics, and telecommunications have enabled novel improvements in medical training and the expansion of the technological tools available to physicians The ever-growing telecommunications network makes medical information instantaneously accessible for both the doctor and the patient, allowing many aspects of medicine to overcome the restrictions of geography Telemedicine has proven useful in improving accessibility to specialist care, breaking geographic barriers of surgical training, and has additionally provided novel teaching methods in medical education For patients, it has improved access to specialty care for vulnerable populations, reduced resource burden of clinic visits, and improved efficiency of postoperative follow-up Telementoring facilitates the knowledge transfer from an experienced surgeon to a trainee and can take on different forms depending on the degree of involvement of the mentor The most basic level, verbal guidance, involves real-time feedback from a mentor observing a video stream of the trainee in the operating field At the next tier, a mentor may provide guidance using telestration, a method in which the mentor can annotate and comment on the real-time video of the operation through a visual overlay on a monitor that is displayed to the trainee in the operating room Telestration may take place in 2-dimensional (2D) or 3-dimensional (3D) forms In the 2D modality, the telementor may annotate within the plane of the video screen The use of 3D telementoring is one of the newer topics of ongoing research and developments to create new ways of more immersive learning A computer program has been developed that can transpose the 2D annotations from a mentor directly onto the trainee's 3D field of view using the da Vinci robot Other technologies involve using motion controllers and 3D mapping software to overlay virtual tools onto stereoscopic images from the trainee's video feed Through these varied approaches, telementoring can provide increasingly immersive and directed training experiences for the surgical trainee Telementoring is becoming commonly implemented and investigated in surgical training across a wide variety of subspecialties In the field of neurosurgery, long-distance telementoring was implemented to assist in craniotomies, carotid endarterectomies, and lumbar laminectomies A study has demonstrated the feasibility of a remote mentor controlling a surgical robot to aid in pedicle screw placement in patients undergoing spinal surgery Within the field of obstetrics and gynecology, studies involving remote reviewing of tele-colposcopies and telementoring of an operative fetoscopy have been published in recent literature Otolaryngology is another surgical subspecialty experiencing a rising interest in telementoring, with recent studies reporting successful telementoring of endoscopic endonasal procedures With the increasing availability and affordability of mobile devices and advancements of internet infrastructure, telementoring is becoming more accessible across the world For example, the virtual interactive presence and augmented reality system utilizes a commercialized tablet at the local station and remote mentoring station to form a single merged surgical field display, which can be streamed to the local surgeon's operating room via remote wireless networks in real time Development of network infrastructure such as the next generation 5G mobile network reduces latency time and improves the quality and speed of the telementoring process Taken together, these advancements in modern technologies have made telementoring much more affordable and available Traditional forms of telementoring relied on annotated video displays from the remote surgeon The next generation of immersive telementoring involves wearable augmented reality devices, which provide a real-time 3D view of the local surgical site while incorporating the annotation from the remote mentoring surgeon directly onto the surgical view of t e local surgeon The device can also be equipped with a fully functioning microphone and headset, allowing direct communication between the 2 parties Microsoft's HoloLens, a device that enables manipulation of holograms and 3D images, has been investigated as an option in augmented reality telementoring When worn by both the local and remote surgeon, the remote surgeon can demonstrate complicated surgical maneuvers in 3D, which is then transmitted to the local surgeon and displayed on their HoloLens device in real time Having been tested in vitro, further research is needed to translate the utility of these newer technologies into clinical practice Thanks to continuous improvements in robotic technology, a telementor may even extend their assistance physically into the operating room;the robot may participate in the procedure by adjusting camera angles or by providing lighting or retraction Beyond the realm of medical training, telesurgery may even encompass an entire surgical procedure start-to-finish by a surgeon in a remote location This has been tested mostly in animal and simulation models but also utilized in direct patient care through some minimally invasive procedures such as laparoscopic cholecystectomy and ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy Haptic feedback technology enables the surgeon to feel the tensile strength, depth, and texture of the surgical tissue without being in the local operating room and is an area of ongoing development Complete telesurgery is still an active topic of research, and the legal and ethical dilemmas of its application in clinical medicine may prove to be a barrier in its future development The ongoing research in telementoring and telesurgery is proving to be even more relevant in the era of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, during which in-person mentorship may not be possible due to travel restrictions and social distancing Telemedicine is also emerging as a versatile tool for improving access to care In one study, audiovisual technology connected patients in Georgia with clinics operated by pediatric neurosurgery specialists from the University of Florida through virtual encounters These specialists cared for patients through the telemedicine clinic and ordered appropriate tests while trained nurses at the location of the clinic distributed care and facilitated referrals Telemedicine can also be implemented for preoperative and postoperative visits, which in turn may alleviate travel-related expenses for the patient Patients can use their smartphone camera to take photos of their surgical incision and send it to the surgeon to monitor for infection A study utilized telehealth in follow-up visits for more than 100 patients who underwent hernia repair and cholecystectomies, showing that a set of directed questions pertaining to wound healing and postoperative activity can be used to appropriately triage patients into higher and lower risk groups The higher risk group were offered clinic visits with the surgeon This study suggested that patients can be safely followed up through telehealth with minimal complication rates, while reducing the need for patients to travel Regarding current clinical application of telemedicine, it is not surprising that its beneficiaries are often the patients with the most limited access to care, such as those who live in rural areas or areas of conflict Appropriate use of telehealth may also alleviate significant time and financial burdens that may occur from a doctor's visit For the health care provider, use of telemedicine opened appointments for the surgical specialist to see new patients, and by decreasing postoperative clinic visits, likely reduces the cost to the health care system overall Telemedicine has also shown great promise in screening programs, such as in the realm of ophthalmology Diabetes is one of the leading causes of blindness in the United States The increasing population of diabetic patients may pose a significant demand on the health care system, and early screening for diabetic eye disease is crucial in saving vision New imaging technology is already being used to automatically determine the presence or absence of diabetic retinopathy and place a referral for a full eye examination if indicated These imaging units may be handled by a trained nurse or technician, and some do not require eye dilation A problem that then arises is the image burden that could accumulate from universal image-based diabetic retinopathy screening;this could yield up to 1 billion images annually worldwide, which greatly outnumbers the number of trained personnel needed for expert reading and interpretation In response to this, developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning have shown promise in automated basic screening of images for disease, only referring patients with signs of disease to an eye care provider The combination of these telescreening technologies also introduces the potential for non-ophthalmologic providers to initiate diabetic eye screenings, which greatly improves access to care Other studies show the promise of telescreening for glaucoma, macular degeneration, and retinopathy of prematurity These screening programs show promise in leading to timely referrals, improved patient follow-up, and adherence to care Although the rapid development of new technology and the internet has introduced great potential in the domain of telemedicine, considerations towards patient safety and privacy, costs of implementation, and themes of legality and medical ethics should be kept in mind The involvement of the internet is a key component in delivery telemedicine to patients Maintaining patient safety should be a top priority in telehealth, as it does in all aspects of health care;however, cyberattacks and unstable internet connections maycomplicate telementoring during surgery or telesurgery, especially when there is limited available infrastructure to prevent against malicious attacks Maintaining patient privacy, especially when massive amounts of sensitive images and patient data are transferred through the internet, should also be a priority Additionally, telemedicine may cause confusion for patients regarding the identity of their health care provider For a patient undergoing surgery that is overseen by telementoring, should the telementor be considered the patient's surgeon? If the patient experiences a bad outcome from the surgery, should the mentor be held responsible even though they were not physically in the operating room? Additionally, yet to be clarified is the financial relationship between the patient and the telementoring physician Furthermore, no standard operating procedures exist for patient consent of telesurgical procedures In the best interest of the patient, these ethical and legal considerations should be investigated further before telesurgery and telementoring can be implemented on a wider scale Due to advancements in medical engineering and communication technology, it is becoming easier to share knowledge with medical trainees across the world through telementoring Telemedicine has also been proven to benefit patients through effective screening programs and providing simple postoperative care and triage services, especially to those with poor access to care Despite the benefits, telemedicine, telementoring, and telesurgery also carry unique challenges to patient safety and the doctor-patient relationship This is an area of active research and its possible applications may be a shaping force in the future of modern medicine","Jin, Man Li Brown Meghan M.; Dhir, Patwa Nirmalan Aravindh Edwards Paul A.",Current Problems in Surgery,,424

Here we propose an evolutionary model based on the thorough dissection of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 - the closest bat relative - spike dynamics, kinetics and binding to ACE2. Our results indicate that both spikes share nearly identical, high affinities for Rhinolophus affinis bat and human ACE2, pointing out to negligible species barriers directly related to receptor binding. Also, SARS-CoV-2 spike shows a higher degree of dynamics and kinetics optimization that favors ACE2 engagement. Therefore, we devise an affinity-independent evolutionary process that likely took place in R. affinis bats and limits the eventual involvement of other animal species in initiating the pandemic to the role of vector.","Castelli, Matteo; Scietti, Luigi; Clementi, Nicola; Cavallaro, Mattia; Faravelli, Silvia; Pinnola, Alberta; Criscuolo, Elena; Diotti, Roberta Antonia; Clementi, Massimo; Forneris, Federico; Mancini, Nicasio",,,424

Lockdown during COVID-19 pandemics substantially cleaned the air. The objective of this is to assess the effects of air cleaning due to lockdown on stress echocardiography (SE) results. We enrolled 19 patients with chronic coronary artery disease and/or heart failure referred to SE (semi-supine bicycle exercise, n = 8, or dipyridamole, n = 11). Before and soon after lockdown, we assessed regional wall motion abnormalities (abnormal value: worsening of &#8805; 2 segments), B-lines (a sign of pulmonary congestion, 4-site simplified scan, abnormal value &#8805; 2), and coronary flow velocity reserve in left anterior descending artery (CFVR, abnormal value < 2.0). Local air quality indicators (same day of SE) of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) were obtained from publicly available data sets of the regional authority of environmental protection. After lockdown, NO2 concentration decreased from 19 ± 10 to 10 ± 4 µg/m3 (p = 0.006). After lockdown, abnormal responses remained unchanged for ischemia (21% vs 16%, p = ns) and decreased for B-lines (42% vs 5%, p = 0.008) and CFVR (84 vs 42%, p = 0.007). Changes in coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) were correlated to same-day variations in NO2 (r = -0.578, p = 0.010) and preceding 30-day changes in PM2.5 (r = -0.518, p = 0.023). After lockdown, air cleaning was associated with a beneficial effect on coronary small vessel dysfunction and alveolar-capillary barrier distress mirrored by improvement of CFVR and B-lines during SE in vulnerable patients.

456412,Economic impact of covid-19 on community pharmacy,2020,"Oxidative stress occurs during the transition period and causes insulin resistance, which may be reduced by the use of antioxidants in this period. Twenty-four multiparous Holstein dairy cows, at 8 wk before parturition, were divided into 4 equal groups, namely control (Ctrl), vitamin E (VE), selenium (Se), and vitamin E plus selenium (VE + Se) groups. On a daily basis, VE and Se cows received dietary 1.5 IU vitamin E/kg BW and 0.3 mg/kg DM selenium, respectively, from 8 wk before to 3 wk after parturition. Vitamin E plus selenium group received doses similar to VE and Se groups. Insulin sensitivity was evaluated through intravenous glucose tolerance test (ivGTT) at weekly intervals from 3 wk before to 3 wk after parturition. Serum concentrations of total antioxidant status (TAS), malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA), and beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) were assayed weekly before the commencement of ivGTT. Based on the results of ivGTT, the lowest and the highest degrees of insulin sensitivity were detected in Ctrl and VE + Se groups, respectively. The highest and the lowest concentrations of NEFA and BHBA were observed in Ctrl and VE + Se groups, respectively. Total antioxidant status, SOD, and GPx values were significantly lower in Ctrl cows and significantly higher in VE + Se-received cows compared with other groups. However, MDA values in Ctrl and VE + Se cows were significantly higher and lower than the other groups, respectively. Collectively, our results show that dietary administration of vitamin E and selenium ameliorates oxidative stress and lipid mobilization and increases insulin sensitivity in transition cows.","Chalmeh, A; Pourjafar, M; Badiei, K; Mirzaei, A; Jalali, M; Mazrouei Sebdani, M",Domest Anim Endocrinol,,424

Characterization of the genetic variants of SARS-CoV-2 is crucial in following and evaluating it spread across countries. In this study, we collected and analyzed 3,067 SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from 55 countries during the first three months after the onset of this virus. Using comparative genomics analysis, we traced the profiles of the whole-genome mutations and compared the frequency of each mutation in the studied population. The accumulation of mutations during the epidemic period with their geographic locations was also monitored. The results showed 782 variants sites, of which 512 (65.47%) had a non-synonymous effect. Frequencies of mutated alleles revealed the presence of 68 recurrent mutations, including ten hotspot non-synonymous mutations with a prevalence higher than 0.10 in this population and distributed in six SARS-CoV-2 genes. The distribution of these recurrent mutations on the world map revealed that certain genotypes are specific to geographic locations. We also identified co-occurring mutations resulting in the presence of several haplotypes. Moreover, evolution over time has shown a mechanism of mutation co-accumulation which might affect the severity and spread of the SARS-CoV-2. The phylogentic analysis identified two major Clades C1 and C2 harboring mutations L3606F and G614D, respectively and both emerging for the first time in China. On the other hand, analysis of the selective pressure revealed the presence of negatively selected residues that could be taken into considerations as therapeutic targets.

459463,Teacher education and Covid-19: responses and opportunities for new pedagogical initiatives,2020,"OBJECTIVE: The psychological sequelae of the COVID-19 crisis will increase demands for psychiatric care in already strained emergency and mental health systems. To address the shortage of psychiatrists (and nurse practitioners and physician assistants) in emergency settings (ESs), the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry (AAEP) has established recommendations for utilizing nonprescribing mental health professionals in the evaluation and management of psychiatric patients in these contexts. METHODS: Faced with limited research on the roles and competencies of nonprescribing psychiatric emergency clinicians (PECs), a multidisciplinary committee of members of AAEP was tasked with developing recommendations for use of PECs. RESULTS: The committee developed eight recommendations regarding the role of PECs in evaluation and management of patients who present to ESs with behavioral emergencies. PECs should have the following competencies: conducting independent psychiatric and substance abuse evaluations; managing behavioral emergencies; aiding in the recognition of confounding medical illnesses, intoxication and withdrawal states, and adverse drug reactions; developing appropriate treatment plans; recognizing when consultation from a psychiatrist or emergency physician is indicated; possessing self-awareness and recognizing clinician-patient dynamics; understanding medicolegal issues, such as involuntary holds and decision-making capacity; and collaborating with clinical teams in ESs. PECs are not meant to replace psychiatrists but to extend the psychiatrist's reach. Use of PECs has already been implemented in some areas of the country. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the AAEP recommendations, ESs can address staffing shortages while ensuring safe management of patients with behavioral emergencies. With appropriate orientation and training, the PEC can serve effectively and competently in an ES.","Richmond, Janet S; Dragatsi, Dianna; Stiebel, Victor; Rozel, John Samuel; Rasimas, Joseph J",Psychiatr Serv,,424

Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were obtained using logistic regression analyses while controlling for grade level, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, suicidal ideation, alcohol and marijuana use, and gun access. Among the sample, 3.3% reported carrying a gun to school at least one time in the previous 12-months, 9.5% reported experiencing gender-based bullying victimization, and 7% reported experiencing sexual orientation-based bullying victimization. Regression analyses indicated that adolescent boys who experienced gender-based bullying victimization (OR 3.40, 95% CI 1.64, 5.62, p < .001) or sexual orientation-based bullying victimization (OR 3.57, 95% CI 1.91, 6.67, p < .001) had greater odds of reporting they carried a gun to school while controlling for grade level, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, suicidal ideation, alcohol and marijuana use, and gun access. These results expand upon previous gun carrying and bullying research by identifying the specific type of the bullying experienced and have important implications for social workers and school personnel. Importantly, these results emphasize the need to address two of the Grand Challenges for Social Work: building healthy relationships to end violence and ensuring the healthy development for all youth.","Ganson, Kyle T; Nagata, Jason M",Child Adolesc Social Work J,,424

Most have easy access to information due to internet connectivity and electronic media, which has helped share information about the pandemic. However, information overload during the current COVID-19 pandemic has posed a set of challenges not encountered before. There is an ""infodemic"" in which false news, conspiracy theories, magical cures and racist news are being shared at an alarming rate, with the potential to increase anxiety and stress and even lead to loss of life. This review highlights some of these challenges and suggests general measures to avoid information overload and infodemic in the connected world of 21st century.","Rathore, Farooq Azam; Farooq, Fareeha",J Pak Med Assoc,,424

462831,Rethinking policing in Aotearoa New Zealand: decolonising lessons from the Covid-19 pandemic,2020,"BACKGROUND: To describe the psychosocial response of the infertile population whose care was curtailed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: A web-based cross-sectional survey was administered to 117 infertile patients at our center who had their infertility treatment delayed due to suspension of care at our hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey consisted of 52-question multiple-choice questions including the Life Orientation Test-Revised (LOT-R) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) instruments. Characteristics of respondents who ""agreed"" (strongly agree and agree) that ""delaying treatment has permanently impacted my chances at future conception"" were compared with participants who ""disagreed"" (neutral, disagree, and strongly disagree) using Fischer's exact test. RESULTS: In total, 79.5% agreed that delaying treatment has permanently impacted their chances at future conception. There were no discernible demographic differences between patients who ""agreed"" versus ""disagreed"" with the above statement. The mean LOT-R score was 14.1 (5.1) with an optimism score of 6.8 (2.6) and a pessimism score of 7.3 (2.9). The mean HADS depression score was 5.4 (3.4) with 28.2% reporting scores in the borderline-abnormal to abnormal range. The mean HADS anxiety score was 9.0 (3.9) with 64.6% reporting scores in the borderline-abnormal to abnormal range. Nearly one third of respondents (36.8%) reported wanting to ""expedite/be more aggressive with treatment,"" whereas only 5.1% wanted to postpone treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Women undergoing ART during the COVID-19 pandemic express significant concern and signs of distress about how delays in care affect their future reproductive potential.","Bortoletto, Pietro; Applegarth, Linda; Josephs, Laura; Witzke, Justine; Romanski, Phillip A; Schattman, Glenn; Rosenwaks, Zev; Grill, Elizabeth",,,424

MethodsWe included 27,865 cases registered between January 2020 and February 2021 in the COVID-19 Registry of Japan to examine the relationship between the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) of COVID-19 patients on the day of admission and the prefecture where the patients live. A hierarchical Bayesian model was used to examine the random effect of each prefecture in addition to the patients backgrounds. In addition, we compared the results of two models; one model included the number of beds secured for COVID-19 patients in each prefecture as one of the fixed effects, and the other model did not. ResultsThe results indicated that the prefecture had a substantial impact on the severity of COVID-19 on admission. Even when considering the effect of the number of beds separately, the heterogeneity caused by the random effect of each prefecture affected the severity of the case on admission. ConclusionsOur analysis revealed a possible association between regional heterogeneity and increased/decreased risk of severe COVID-19 infection on admission. This heterogeneity was derived not only from the number of beds secured in each prefecture but also from other factors.","Tsuzuki, Shinya; Asai, Yusuke; Matsunaga, Nobuaki; Ishioka, Haruhiko; Akiyama, Takayuki; Ohmagari, Norio",,,424

466558,Restorative dental treatment in times of COVID-19/ Tratamento dentário restaurador em tempos de COVID-19,2020,"The outbreak of COVID-19 triggered the largest human-virus war in this century. Current evidence indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 strain of coronavirus is mainly transmitted by droplets either by direct or indirect contact. The duration of infectiousness of COVID-19 ranges from 1-2 days before and 7-10 days after the onset of symptoms. It is often difficult to detect the signs and symptoms of infection and to implement timely intervention during the very early stage of infection. Thus, finding and isolating symptomatic patients may not be sufficient to contain this epidemic. Therefore, it is very important to wear masks, take personal precautions, and practice recommended social distancing to achieve source control and stop transmission. Taiwan has learned from its previous experience with the SARS epidemic and prepared for the potential of new disease outbreaks for at least 17 years. This helped the government to implement a multifaceted strategy in the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. Taiwan's effective response has made the country a model for pandemic response policy that has been appreciated internationally. This paper examines COVID-19 epidemic prevention from the perspective of infection control strategies. In Taiwan, hospital infection control, which is practiced nationwide, emphasizes the importance to epidemic prevention of collecting and tracking travel history, occupation, contact history, cluster (TOCC) information; practicing hand hygiene; promoting the correct use of personal protective equipment; and maintaining safe distances from others. Personal control measures are recognized as critical to providing a safe environment for patients and staff.","Huang, Wan-Tsuei; Chen, Yin-Yin",Hu Li Za Zhi,,424

The effects of the pandemic will likely have long-standing effects on the well-being of youth, and access to mental health care is even more critical during this time. For the past 5 years, TRAILS (Transforming Research into Action to Improve the Lives of Students) has been working throughout the state to increase utilization of evidence-based mental health practices among K-12 school mental health professionals (SMHPs). By leveraging SMHPs who are widely accessible to students, TRAILS seeks to improve youth access to effective mental health care and reduce current mental health inequities. In March 2020, TRAILS responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by developing a group manual designed to be delivered virtually by SMHPs to help students develop effective coping skills to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. TRAILS focuses on promoting use of CBT and mindfulness, as these skills are ideally suited for school-based delivery, and thus the new manual, Coping with COVID-19 (CC-19), was grounded in these modalities. This article will describe the design, development, and deployment of the CC-19 program to address the mental health needs of students in the context of the pandemic.

This document proposes a data-driven approach to nowcast Rt based on previous observations' statistical behavior. As more information arrives, the method naturally becomes more precise about the final count of confirmed positives. Our method's strength is that it is based on the self-reported onset of symptoms, in contrast to other methods that use the daily report's count to infer this quantity.

Three hundred and sixty-three subjects were enrolled in the study, 259 (71.3%) expressed their willingness to receive COVID-19 vaccination. The main determinants associated with vaccination acceptance resulted “trust in safety and effectiveness of vaccinations” and the absence of any previous negative vaccination experience. Unfavourable information on COVID-19 vaccination obtained through internet/media/social media and lack of confidence in COVID-19 vaccines and in the Italian national healthcare system are the main determinants associated with vaccine refusal.

470420,Improvement in appropriateness and diagnostic yield of fast-track endoscopy during the COVID-19 pandemic in Northern Italy,2020,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has become a global crisis. There is no therapeutic treatment specific for COVID-19. It is highly desirable to identify potential antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 from existing drugs available for other diseases and thus repurpose them for treatment of COVID-19. In general, a drug repurposing effort for treatment of a new disease, such as COVID-19, usually starts from a virtual screening of existing drugs, followed by experimental validation, but the actual hit rate is generally rather low with traditional computational methods. Here we report a virtual screening approach with accelerated free energy perturbation-based absolute binding free energy (FEP-ABFE) predictions and its use in identifying drugs targeting SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro). The accurate FEP-ABFE predictions were based on the use of a restraint energy distribution (RED) function, making the practical FEP-ABFE-based virtual screening of the existing drug library possible. As a result, out of 25 drugs predicted, 15 were confirmed as potent inhibitors of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro The most potent one is dipyridamole (inhibitory constant Ki = 0.04 µM) which has shown promising therapeutic effects in subsequently conducted clinical studies for treatment of patients with COVID-19. Additionally, hydroxychloroquine (Ki = 0.36 µM) and chloroquine (Ki = 0.56 µM) were also found to potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 Mpro We anticipate that the FEP-ABFE prediction-based virtual screening approach will be useful in many other drug repurposing or discovery efforts.","Li, Zhe; Li, Xin; Huang, Yi-You; Wu, Yaoxing; Liu, Runduo; Zhou, Lingli; Lin, Yuxi; Wu, Deyan; Zhang, Lei; Liu, Hao; Xu, Ximing; Yu, Kunqian; Zhang, Yuxia; Cui, Jun; Zhan, Chang-Guo; Wang, Xin; Luo, Hai-Bin",Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,,424
471113,The impacts of COVID-19 lockdown on PM10 and SO2 concentrations and association with human mobility across Turkey,2021,"INTRODUCTION: Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) with lung involvement frequently causes morbidity and mortality. Advanced age appears to be the most important risk factor. The receptor for advanced glycation end-product (RAGE) pathway is considered to play important roles in the physiological aging and pathogenesis of lung diseases. This study aims to investigate the possible relationship between COVID-19 and RAGE pathway. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 23 asymptomatic patients and 35 patients with lung involvement who were diagnosed with COVID-19 as well as 22 healthy volunteers. Lung involvement was determined using computed-tomography. Serum soluble-RAGE (sRAGE) levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: The sRAGE levels were significantly higher in the asymptomatic group than in the control group. Age, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, and ferritin levels were higher and the sRAGE level was lower in the patients with lung involvement than in the asymptomatic patients. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, patients with high sRAGE levels were younger and had asymptomatic COVID-19. Patients with low sRAGE levels were elderly patients with lung involvement, which indicates that the RAGE pathway plays an important role in the aggravation of COVID-19.","Yalcin Kehribar, Demet; Cihangiroglu, Mustafa; Sehmen, Emine; Avci, Bahattin; Capraz, Aylin; Yildirim Bilgin, Ayse; Gunaydin, Caner; Ozgen, Metin",Biomarkers,,424

According to the cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the UK and China, the upper limit of the spread of COVID-19 in different evolutionary scenarios is set. Using SPSS to perform logistic curve fitting, the frequency fitting equations of cumulative confirmed cases under different evolution scenarios are obtained respectively. The analysis result shows that the emergency response strategy adopted by the government in the early days of the epidemic can effectively control the spread of the epidemic. Combined with the transmission frequency equation of COVID-19 epidemic, measures taken by the government are analyzed. The influence of each measure on the frequency variable is judged and then the influence on the spread of the epidemic is obtained. Finally, based on the above analysis, the government is advised to adhere to the principles of scientific, initiative and flexibility when facing major epidemics.","Wei, Jinyu; Wang, Li; Yang, Xin",PLoS One,,424

To tackle this issue, medical students have been strongly involved in early patient triage through medical phone call regulation. Here, we present an intelligent web-based decision support system for COVID-19 phone call regulation, developed by and for, medical students to help them during this difficult but crucial task. The system is divided into 5 tabs. The first tab displays administrative information, clinical data related to life-threatening emergency, and personalized recommendations for patient management. The second tab displays a PDF report summarizing the clinical situation; the third tab displays the guidelines used for establishing the recommendations, and the fourth tab displays the overall algorithm in the form of a decision tree. The fifth tab provided a short user guide. The system was assessed by 21 medical staff. More than 90% of them appreciated the navigation and the interface, and found the content relevant. 90,5% of them would like to use it during the medical regulation. In the future, we plan to use this system during simulation-based medical learning for the initial medical training of medical students.","Vrel, Jean-Patrick; Oulmane, Samy; Boukobza, Adrien; Burgun, Anita; Tsopra, Rosy",Stud Health Technol Inform,,424

This study seeks to define the impact of SIP on the epidemiology of pediatric trauma. Methods We examined pediatric trauma admissions at 5 Level 1 and 1 Level 2 US pediatric trauma centers between January 1st-June 30th, 2017–2020. Demographic and injury data were compared between pre- and post-SIP patient cohorts. Results 8772 pediatric trauma activations were reviewed. There was a 13% decrease in trauma volume in 2020, with a nadir at 16days following implementation of SIP. Injury severity scores were higher in the post-SIP cohort. The incidence of non-motorized vehicle accidents and gunshot wounds increased in the post-SIP cohort. Conclusions We found an overall decrease in pediatric trauma volume following SIP. However, injuries tended to be more severe. Our findings help inform targeted injury prevention campaigns during future pandemics.","Bessoff, Kovi E.; Han, Ryan W.; Cho, Min Stroud Melanie Urrechaga Eva M.; Thorson, Chad M.; Russell, Katie W.; Rohan, Autumn Acker Shannon N.; Swain, Shakeva Malvezzi Leopoldo Fuchs Julie R.; Chao, Stephanie D.",Surgery Open Science,,424

Why is understanding the incubation period of COVID-19 important? How long is the incubation time, and what are the associating factors? How should the incubation period be modeled given the current pandemic situation? Where should we go from here? As a critical epidemiological metric, the incubation period is of public health and clinical importance. While the incubation time of COVID-19 is generally similar to that of SARS and MERS, recent studies identifying factors that impact the incubation period of COVID-19, travel history, for example, only tell part of the story. Therefore, in addition to reviewing current findings, this chapter also explores the modeling technique and future research directions of the incubation period of COVID-19.","Leung, Char",Adv Exp Med Biol,,424

Despite these risks, there have been no consistent statements on surgical guidelines regarding the perioperative screening or management of COVID-19 patients, and we do not have objective global data that describe the current conditions surrounding this issue. This study aimed to clarify the current global surgical practice including COVID-19 screening, preventive measures and in-hospital infection under the COVID-19 pandemic, and to clarify the international gaps on infection control policies among countries worldwide. Methods: During April 2-8, 2020, a cross-sectional online survey on surgical practice was distributed to surgeons worldwide through international surgical societies, social media and personal contacts. Main outcome and measures included preventive measures and screening policies of COVID-19 in surgical practice and centers' experiences of in-hospital COVID-19 infection. Data were analyzed by country's cumulative deaths number by April 8, 2020 (high risk, >5000; intermediate risk, 100-5000; low risk, <100). Results: A total of 936 centers in 71 countries responded to the survey (high risk, 330 centers; intermediate risk, 242 centers; low risk, 364 centers). In the majority (71.9%) of the centers, local guidelines recommended preoperative testing based on symptoms or suspicious radiologic findings. Universal testing for every surgical patient was recommended in only 18.4% of the centers. In-hospital COVID-19 infection was reported from 31.5% of the centers, with higher rates in higher risk countries (high risk, 53.6%; intermediate risk, 26.4%; low risk, 14.8%; P < 0.001). Of the 295 centers that experienced in-hospital COVID-19 infection, 122 (41.4%) failed to trace it and 58 (19.7%) reported the infection originating from asymptomatic patients/staff members. Higher risk countries adopted more preventive measures including universal testing, routine testing of hospital staff and use of dedicated personal protective equipment in operation theatres, but there were remarkable discrepancies across the countries. Conclusions: This large international survey captured the global surgical practice under the COVID-19 pandemic and highlighted the insufficient preoperative screening of COVID-19 in the current surgical practice. More intensive screening programs will be necessary particularly in severely affected countries/institutions.

Comment on ""Effectiveness of Virtual Medical Teaching During the COVID-19 Crisis: Systematic Review""",2021,"Importance: A novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has recently been identified as the cause of a pandemic called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this context, some associated skin diseases have been described. Cutaneous lesions referred to as acute acro-ischemia have been reported as a possible sign of COVID-19 in adolescents and children. Objective: To evaluate the pathogenesis of these newly described acute acral lesions. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective case series was conducted at La Fe University Hospital, a tertiary referral hospital in Valencia, Spain, between April 9 and April 15, 2020. Among 32 referred patients, 20 children and adolescents with new-onset inflammatory lesions did not have a diagnosis. Exposures: Patients were not exposed to any drug or other intervention. Main Outcomes and Measures: We performed reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 and a range of blood tests for possible origins of the lesions. Skin biopsies were performed in 6 patients. Results: Of the 20 patients enrolled, 7 were female and 13 were male, with an age range of 1 to 18 years. Clinical findings fit into the following patterns: acral erythema (6 patients), dactylitis (4 patients), purpuric maculopapules (7 patients), and a mixed pattern (3 patients). None of the patients had remarkable hematologic or serologic abnormalities, including negative antibodies to SARS-CoV-2. Biopsies performed in 6 patients showed histologic findings characteristic of perniosis. Conclusions and Relevance: The clinical, histologic, and laboratory test results were compatible with a diagnosis of perniosis, and no evidence was found to support the implication of SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Roca-Ginés, Juncal; Torres-Navarro, Ignacio; Sánchez-Arráez, Javier; Abril-Pérez, Carlos; Sabalza-Baztán, Oihana; Pardo-Granell, Sergio; Martínez I Cózar, Vicent; Botella-Estrada, Rafael; Évole-Buselli, Montserrat",JAMA Dermatol,,424

The search for a suitable vaccine as well as effective therapeutics for the treatment of COVID-19 is underway. Drug repurposing screens provide a useful and effective solution for identifying potential therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. For example, the experimental drug remdesivir, originally developed for Ebola virus infections, has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as an emergency use treatment of COVID-19. However, the efficacy and toxicity of this drug need further improvements. In this review, we discuss recent findings on the pathology of coronaviruses and the drug targets for the treatment of COVID-19. Both SARS-CoV-2-specific inhibitors and broad-spectrum anticoronavirus drugs against SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, and SARS-CoV-2 will be valuable additions to the anti-SARS-CoV-2 armament. A multitarget treatment approach with synergistic drug combinations containing different mechanisms of action may be a practical therapeutic strategy for the treatment of severe COVID-19. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Understanding the biology and pathology of RNA viruses is critical to accomplish the challenging task of developing vaccines and therapeutics against SARS-CoV-2. This review highlights the anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug targets and therapeutic development strategies for COVID-19 treatment.","Shyr, Zeenat A; Gorshkov, Kirill; Chen, Catherine Z; Zheng, Wei",J Pharmacol Exp Ther,,424

An improved ability to predict a patient's clinical course would facilitate optimal care decisions, resource allocation, family counseling, and strategies for safely easing distancing restrictions. The Care Assessment Need (CAN) score is an existing risk assessment tool within the Veterans Health Administration (VA), and produces a score from 0 to 99, with a higher score correlating to a greater risk. The model was originally designed for the nonacute outpatient setting and is automatically calculated from structured data variables in the electronic health record. This multisite retrospective study of 6591 Veterans diagnosed with COVID-19 from March 2, 2020 to May 26, 2020 was designed to assess the utility of repurposing the CAN score as objective and automated risk assessment tool to promptly enhance clinical decision making for Veterans diagnosed with COVID-19. We performed bivariate analyses on the dichotomized CAN 1-year mortality score (high vs. low risk) and each patient outcome using Chi-square tests of independence. Logistic regression models using the continuous CAN score were fit to assess its predictive power for outcomes of interest. Results demonstrated that a CAN score greater than 50 was significantly associated with the following outcomes after positive COVID-19 test: hospital admission (OR 4.6), prolonged hospital stay (OR 4.5), ICU admission (3.1), prolonged ICU stay (OR 2.9), mechanical ventilation (OR 2.6), and mortality (OR 7.2). Repurposing the CAN score offers an efficient way to risk-stratify COVID-19 Veterans. As a result of the compelling statistical results, and automation, this tool is well positioned for broad use across the VA to enhance clinical decision-making.","Osborne, Thomas F; Veigulis, Zachary P; Arreola, David M; Röösli, Eliane; Curtin, Catherine M",PLoS One,,424

This shortage has been further worsened by screening of asymptomatic populations such as returning employees, students, and so on, as part of plans to reopen the economy. To optimize the utilization of testing reagents and human resources, pool testing of populations with low prevalence has emerged as a promising strategy. Although pooling is an effective solution to reduce the number of reagents used for testing, the process of pooling samples together and tracking them throughout the entire workflow is challenging. To be effective, samples must be tracked into each pool, pool-tested and reported individually. In this article, we address these challenges using robotics and informatics. © The Author(s) 2021.","Balasubramani, B.; Newsom, K. J.; Martinez, K.

DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey (August-October in 2020) of internal medicine physicians at two academic hospitals in Vancouver, Canada. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Physician burnout and its components, emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation and personal accomplishment were measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory. RESULTS: The response rate was 38% (n=302/803 respondents, 49% women,). The prevalence of burnout was 68% (emotional exhaustion 63%, depersonalisation 39%) and feeling low personal accomplishment 22%. In addition, 21% reported that they were considering quitting the profession or had quit a position. Women were more likely to report emotional exhaustion (OR 2.00, 95% CI: 1.07 to 3.73, p=0.03) and feeling low personal accomplishment (OR 2.26, 95% CI: 1.09 to 4.70, p=0.03) than men. Visible ethnic minority physicians were more likely to report feeling lower personal accomplishment than white physicians (OR 1.81, 95% CI: 1.28 to 2.55, p=0.001). There was no difference in emotional exhaustion or depersonalisation by ethnicity or sexual orientation. Physicians who reported that COVID-19 affected their burnout were more likely to report any burnout (OR: 3.74, 95% CI: 1.99 to 7.01, p<0.001) and consideration of quitting or quit (OR: 3.20, 95% CI: 1.34 to 7.66, p=0.009). CONCLUSION: Burnout affects 2 out of 3 internal medicine physicians during the pandemic. Women, ethnic minority physicians and those who feel that COVID-19 affects burnout were more likely to report components of burnout. Further understanding of factors driving feelings of low personal accomplishment in women and ethnic minority physicians is needed.","Khan, Nadia; Palepu, Anita; Dodek, Peter; Salmon, Amy; Leitch, Heather; Ruzycki, Shannon; Townson, Andrea; Lacaille, Diane",BMJ Open,,424

Accepted manuscripts have been peer-reviewed and copyedited, but are posted online before technical formatting and author proofing. These manuscripts are not the final version of record and will be replaced with the final article (formatted per AJHP style and proofed by the authors) at a later time. PURPOSE: The purpose of this manuscript is to describe our experience developing an antimicrobial stewardship (AS) module as a clinical decision support tool in the Epic electronic health record (EHR). SUMMARY: Clinical decision support systems within the EHR can be used to decrease use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, improve antibiotic selection and dosing, decrease adverse effects, reduce antibiotic costs, and reduce the development of antibiotic resistance. The Johns Hopkins Hospital constructed an AS module within Epic. Customized stewardship alerts and scoring systems were developed to triage patients requiring stewardship intervention. This required a multidisciplinary approach with a team comprising AS physicians and pharmacists and Epic information technology personnel, with assistance from clinical microbiology and infection control when necessary. In addition, an intervention database was enhanced with stewardship-specific interventions, and workbench reports were developed specific to AS needs. We herein review the process, advantages, and challenges associated with the development of the Epic AS module. CONCLUSION: Customizing an AS module in an EHR requires significant time and expertise in antimicrobials; however, AS modules have the potential to improve the efficiency of AS personnel in performing daily stewardship activities and reporting through a single system.","Dzintars, Kathryn; Fabre, Valeria M; Avdic, Edina; Smith, Janessa; Adams-Sommer, Victoria; Townsend, Jennifer; Jenh Hsu, Alice; Cosgrove, Sara E",Am. j. health system pharm,,424

489499,Dexamethasone use and mortality in hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease 2019: A multicentre retrospective observational study,2021,"Purpose: Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is associated with a poor overall prognosis. PIM family genes, including PIM1, PIM2, and PIM3, are proto-oncogenes that are aberrantly overexpressed in different types of human cancers. In this study, we aimed to explore and clarify the function of PIM3 in AML. Patients and Methods: The expression of the three PIM genes in AML was detected using the Gene Expression Omnibus. The expression of PIM3 and PIM3 in patient samples and AML cell lines was measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction or Western blot analyses. The cellular behaviors of PIM3-overexpressing AML cell lines were detected using a CCK-8 assay, flow cytometry, Western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, and a cell migration assay. The interactions between PIM3 and phosphorylated CXCR4 (pCXCR4) were explored via immunoprecipitation. Results: Higher PIM3 expression was detected in primary AML cells than in healthy donor cells. Second, PIM3 overexpression promoted AML cell proliferation and protected against spontaneous apoptosis by phosphorylating BAD (pBAD) at Ser112. Furthermore, PIM3 overexpression might promote the migration of AML cells via CXCR4. PIM3-overexpressing AML cell lines exhibited increased CXCR4 phosphorylation at Ser339, and pCXCR4 interacted with PIM3. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that PIM3 regulates the proliferation, survival, and chemotaxis of AML cell lines. Moreover, pCXCR4 might mediate the regulation of PIM3-induced chemotaxis. Therefore, the inhibition of PIM3 expression may be a promising therapeutic target in AML.","Luo, Hongmei; Sun, Ruixue; Zheng, Yuhuan; Huang, Jingcao; Wang, Fangfang; Long, Dan; Wu, Yu",Onco Targets Ther,,424

What comes next?",2021,"A turbidity telemetry system for COVID-19 pandemic situations using nRF24L01+transceiver and SEN0189 water turbidity sensor-based microcontroller has been successfuly� developed.. The method used to characterize the sensor is by comparing sensor output voltages with the value of water turbidity. Turbid water used was created by adding distilled water with a concentration of sediment obtained from the filtered sediment with less than 60 ?m in diameter. Data transmission performance for various transmit power was done by calculating the error percentages by comparing the number of messages sent by transmitter and received by receiver. The transmit power settings were 0, -6, -12, and 18 dBm and variations in the distance of data transmission from 10 to 80 m. The test results show that the water turbidity sensor has a good measurement range in measuring turbidity of water from 1.873 to 3500 NTU. Higher concentrations of sediment and turbidity of the water made the sensor output voltage decrease. There was a decrease in output voltage in the value, namely -0.0006 in turbidity sensor sensitivity. The results also show an increase in error percentages as the distance of data transmission increases, while the bigger the transmit power is used for data transmission, the smaller the percentage of errors occurs.","Hasanah, Lilik; Hakim, Wahyu Luqmanul; Aminudin, Ahmad; Sahari, Siti Kudnie; Mulyanti, Budi",Indonesian Journal Of Science And Technology,,424

President Trump's delegation of responsibility to the states during the COVID-19 pandemic placed governors on the frontlines of the battle; some have shined and garnered positive national attention, others have wilted under the pressure of the national spotlight. Methods: We use regression discontinuity design and exploit a discontinuity in the state's political events to assess the support of a governor's response to the pandemic. Results: Using survey data from Florida's registered voters, we find that Governor DeSantis's approval dropped by 7 percentage points following his ""Safer at Home"" order press conference on April 1. Conclusion: Our results suggest that under certain circumstances partisanship can blunt a ""rally around the flag"" effect. This finding provides context to understanding when and under which circumstances elected officials can expect increases (or decreases) in public support.","Shino, Enrijeta; Binder, Michael",Social science quarterly,,424

491099,Belief in conspiracy theories about COVID-19 amongst Venezuelan students: A pilot study,2021,"The COVID-19 crisis has led to spiking unemployment rates with disproportionate impacts on low-income families. School and child-care center closures have also meant lost free and reduced-price school meals. Food prices have increased sharply, leading to reduced purchasing power for families with limited income. The Families First Coronavirus Response Act and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act constituted a robust response, including expansions to unemployment insurance (expansions in eligibility and a $600 per week supplement), a onetime payment of $1,200 per adult and $500 per dependent, an increase in SNAP payments, and the launch of the Pandemic EBT program to replace lost school meals. Despite these efforts, real-time data show significant distress-notably, food insecurity rates have increased almost three times over the pre-COVID-19 rates and food pantry use has also spiked. In this paper, we explore why there is so much unmet need despite a robust policy response. We provide evidence for three explanations: (1) timing-relief came with a substantial delay, due to overwhelmed unemployment insurance (UI) systems and the need to implement new programs;(2) magnitude-payments outside UI are modest;and (3) coverage gaps-access is lower for some groups, and other groups are statutorily excluded.","Bitler, M.

Tracing governing knowledge and truth discourse in global COVID-19 policy responses,2021,"BACKGROUND: Mycoplasma hominis, an opportunistic pathogen in human genitourinary tract, can cause chronic infection in the prostate. Intracellular survival of M. hominis leads to a prolonged presence in the host cells that can affect the cell's biological cycle. In the present study, we aimed to evaluate the frequency of M. hominis DNA in prostate tissue of Iranian patients with prostate cancer (PCa) in comparison to a control group with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). METHODS: This research was a retrospective case-control study using 61 archived formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) blocks of prostate tissue from patients with PCa and 70 FFPE blocks of patients with BPH. Real-time PCR, targeting two different genes, 16S rRNA and yidC, in the M. hominis genome was performed for all specimens. RESULTS: Out of 61 blocks of prostate biopsy from patients with PCa, eight samples (13%) were positive for M. hominis, while the bacterium was not detected in any of the 70 blocks of patients with BPH (P value, 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: The high frequency of M. hominis in patients with PCa likely shows a hidden role of the organism in prostate cancer during its chronic, apparently silent and asymptomatic colonization in prostate.","Saadat, Saman; Karami, Pezhman; Jafari, Mohammad; Kholoujini, Mahdi; Rikhtegaran Tehrani, Zahra; Mohammadi, Younes; Alikhani, Mohammad Yousef",Pathog.

Las predicciones incluyen, población total contagiada, mortalidad y necesidad de recursos hospitalarios. Segundo objetivo: modelar la mortalidad y la necesidad de recursos hospitalarios, estratificando por edad el escenario de contagio del 70% de la población. Métodos Para el primer objetivo, nos basamos en el número de casos confirmados en el país hasta marzo 18, 2020 (n=93). Como suposiciones para el modelo, incluimos un índice de contagio R0=2,5 y el índice de casos reales por cada caso confirmado. Para la proporción de pacientes que necesitarían cuidados intensivos u otros cuidados intrahospitalarios, nos basamos en datos aportados por el Imperial College of London. Para el segundo objetivo usamos como tasa de mortalidad por edad, datos aportados por el Instituto Superiore di Sanità en Italia. Resultados Basándonos en los 93 casos reportados al 18 de marzo, si no se aplicase ninguna medida de mitigación, para el 18 de abril el país tendría un total de 613 037 casos. Medidas de mitigación que reduzcan el R0 en un 10%, generan una reducción del 50% del número de casos. Sin embargo, a pesar de reducirse los casos a la mitad, todavía habría un déficit en el número de camas requeridas y sólo uno de cada dos pacientes tendría acceso a dicho recurso. Conclusión En nuestro modelo encontramos que las medidas de mitigación que han sido implementadas hasta la fecha por el gobierno colombiano, se fundamentan en evidencia suficiente para pensar que es posible reducir significativamente el número de casos contagiados y con esto, el número de pacientes que requerirán manejo hospitalario.(AU)","González-Jaramillo, Valentina; González-Jaramillo, Nathalia; Gómez-Restrepo, Carlos; Palacio-Acosta, Carlos A; Gómez-López, Arley; Franco, Oscar H",Rev. salud pública,,424

To address this, and to facilitate researchers to broadly evaluate the effectiveness of their models, we introduce Benchmarking-IR (BEIR), a robust and heterogeneous evaluation benchmark for information retrieval. We leverage a careful selection of 18 publicly available datasets from diverse text retrieval tasks and domains and evaluate 10 state-of-the-art retrieval systems including lexical, sparse, dense, late-interaction and re-ranking architectures on the BEIR benchmark. Our results show BM25 is a robust baseline and re-ranking and late-interaction-based models on average achieve the best zero-shot performances, however, at high computational costs. In contrast, dense and sparse-retrieval models are computationally more efficient but often underperform other approaches, highlighting the considerable room for improvement in their generalization capabilities.

502721,SME policy in the Russian Federation: Renewal after the pandemic?,2020,"Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been declared a global pandemic and is a major public health concern worldwide. In this study, we aimed to determine the role of environmental factors, such as climate and air pollutants, in the transmission of COVID-19 in the Republic of Korea. We collected epidemiological and environmental data from two regions of the Republic of Korea, namely Seoul metropolitan region (SMR) and Daegu-Gyeongbuk region (DGR) from February 2020 to July 2020. The data was then analyzed to identify correlations between each environmental factor with confirmed daily COVID-19 cases. Among the various environmental parameters, the duration of sunshine and ozone level were found to positively correlate with COVID-19 cases in both regions. However, the association of temperature variables with COVID-19 transmission revealed contradictory results when comparing the data from SMR and DGR. Moreover, statistical bias may have arisen due to an extensive epidemiological investigation and altered socio-behaviors that occurred in response to a COVID-19 outbreak. Nevertheless, our results suggest that various environmental factors may play a role in COVID-19 transmission.","Lim, Yong Kwan; Kweon, Oh Joo; Kim, Hye Ryoun; Kim, Tae-Hyoung; Lee, Mi-Kyung",Sci Rep,,424
502921,"Are COVID fatalities in the US higher than in the EU, and if so, why?",2021,"Unsupervised adaptation to the spatiotemporal statistics of visual experience is a key computational principle that has long been assumed to govern postnatal development of visual cortical tuning, including orientation selectivity of simple cells and position tolerance of complex cells in primary visual cortex (V1). Yet, causal empirical evidence supporting this hypothesis is scant. Here, we show that degrading the temporal continuity of visual experience during early postnatal life leads to a sizable reduction of the number of complex cells and to an impairment of their functional properties while fully sparing the development of simple cells. This causally implicates adaptation to the temporal structure of the visual input in the development of transformation tolerance but not of shape tuning, thus tightly constraining computational models of unsupervised cortical learning.","Matteucci, Giulio; Zoccolan, Davide",Sci.

503206,COVID-19: Fear of pandemic and short-term IPO performance,2021,"BACKGROUND: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) with the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) for aerosol generating procedures (AGP) in patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 remains challenging. AIM: The aim of this study was to compare three chest compression methods applied by paramedics wearing PPE. METHODS: The single-blinded, multi-centre, randomized, cross-over simulation study involved 67 paramedics wearing PPE AGP. They performed 2-minute continuous chest compressions (CCs) in an adult patient with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 in three scenarios: (a) manual CCs; (b) CCs with a TrueCPR feedback device; (c) CCs with a LUCAS3 mechanical CC device. RESULTS: CC depth when using LUCAS3 compared with TrueCPR and manual CC was more frequently correct 51 [50-55] vs. 47 [43-52] vs. 43 [38-46]mm; P = 0.005) and more often performed correctly regarding CC rate 102 [100-102] vs. 105 [98-1114] vs. 116 [112-129] compressions per minute; P = 0.027) and chest recoil 100 [98-100] vs. 83 [60-92] vs. 39 [25-50]%; P = 0.001). A detailed analysis of 2-minute resuscitation with manual CCs showed a decrease in compression depth and full chest recoil after 1 minute of CCs. CONCLUSION: We show that during simulated resuscitation with the use of PPE AGP in patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19, CC with LUCAS3 compared with manual CCs as well as a TrueCPR feedback device essentially increased CC quality. In the case of manual CCs by paramedics dressed in PPE AGP, it is advisable to change the person performing CC every minute.","Malysz, Marek; Smereka, Jacek; Jaguszewski, Milosz; Dabrowski, Marek; Nadolny, Klaudiusz; Ruetzler, Kurt; Ladny, Jerzy R; Sterlinski, Maciej; Filipiak, Krzysztof J; Szarpak, Lukasz",Kardiol. pol,,424
503268,COVID-19: an FY1 on the frontline,2020,"BACKGROUND: Reports from around the world have indicated a fatality rate of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in the range of 20%-30% among patients with ESKD. Population-level effects of COVID-19 on patients with ESKD in the United States are uncertain. METHODS: We identified patients with ESKD from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services data during epidemiologic weeks 3-27 of 2017-2020 and corresponding weeks of 2017-2019, stratifying them by kidney replacement therapy. Outcomes comprised hospitalization for COVID-19, all-cause death, and hospitalization for reasons other than COVID-19. We estimated adjusted relative rates (ARRs) of death and non-COVID-19 hospitalization during epidemiologic weeks 13-27 of 2020 (March 22 to July 4) versus corresponding weeks in 2017-2019. RESULTS: Among patients on dialysis, the rate of COVID-19 hospitalization peaked between March 22 and April 25 2020. Non-Hispanic Black race and Hispanic ethnicity associated with higher rates of COVID-19 hospitalization, whereas peritoneal dialysis was associated with lower rates. During weeks 13-27, ARRs of death in 2020 versus 2017-2019 were 1.17 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.16 to 1.19) and 1.30 (95% CI, 1.24 to 1.36) among patients undergoing dialysis or with a functioning transplant, respectively. Excess mortality was higher among non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and Asian patients. Among patients on dialysis, the rate of non-COVID-19 hospitalization during weeks 13-27 in 2020 was 17% lower versus hospitalization rates for corresponding weeks in 2017-2019. CONCLUSIONS: During the first half of 2020, the clinical outcomes of patients with ESKD were greatly affected by COVID-19, and racial and ethnic disparities were apparent. These findings should be considered in prioritizing administration of COVID-19 vaccination.","Weinhandl, Eric D; Wetmore, James B; Peng, Yi; Liu, Jiannong; Gilbertson, David T; Johansen, Kirsten L",J Am Soc Nephrol,,424

Under each scenario we estimate the number of people who are likely to get infected and require medical attention, hospitalization, and ventilators. Given the per capita medical cost for each of these health states, we compute the total medical costs for each scenario and show the tradeoffs between deaths, costs, infections, compliance and the duration of stay-home order. We also consider the hospital bed capacity of each Hospital Referral Region (HRR) in the US to estimate the deficit in beds each HRR will likely encounter given the demand for hospital beds. We consider a case where HRRs share hospital beds among the neighboring HRRs during a surge in demand beyond the available beds and the impact it has in controlling additional deaths.","Chen, Jiangzhuo; Vullikanti, Anil; Hoops, Stefan; Mortveit, Henning; Lewis, Bryan; Venkatramanan, Srinivasan; You, Wen; Eubank, Stephen; Marathe, Madhav; Barrett, Chris; Marathe, Achla",Sci Rep,,424

505378,Novel Graduate Medical Education in the Era of a Novel Virus,2020,"BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 has triggered a pandemic that is now claiming many lives. Several studies have investigated cellular immune responses in COVID-19-infected patients during disease but little is known regarding a possible protracted impact of COVID-19 on the adaptive and innate immune system in COVID-19 convalescent patients. METHODS: We used multiparametric flow cytometry to analyze whole peripheral blood samples and determined SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels against the S-protein, its RBD-subunit, and viral nucleocapsid in a cohort of COVID-19 convalescent patients who had mild disease ~10 weeks after infection (n = 109) and healthy control subjects (n = 98). Furthermore, we correlated immunological changes with clinical and demographic parameters. RESULTS: Even ten weeks after disease COVID-19 convalescent patients had fewer neutrophils, while their cytotoxic CD8+ T cells were activated, reflected as higher HLA-DR and CD38 expression. Multiparametric regression analyses showed that in COVID-19-infected patients both CD3+ CD4+ and CD3+ CD8+ effector memory cells were higher, while CD25+ Foxp3+ T regulatory cells were lower. In addition, both transitional B cell and plasmablast levels were significantly elevated in COVID-19-infected patients. Fever (duration, level) correlated with numbers of central memory CD4+ T cells and anti-S and anti-RBD, but not anti-NC antibody levels. Moreover, a ""young immunological age"" as determined by numbers of CD3+ CD45RA+ CD62L+ CD31+ recent thymic emigrants was associated with a loss of sense of taste and/or smell. CONCLUSION: Acute SARS-CoV-2 infection leaves protracted beneficial (ie, activation of T cells) and potentially harmful (ie, reduction of neutrophils) imprints in the cellular immune system in addition to induction of specific antibody responses.","Kratzer, Bernhard; Trapin, Doris; Ettel, Paul; Körmöczi, Ulrike; Rottal, Arno; Tuppy, Friedrich; Feichter, Melanie; Gattinger, Pia; Borochova, Kristina; Dorofeeva, Yulia; Tulaeva, Inna; Weber, Milena; Grabmeier-Pfistershammer, Katharina; Tauber, Peter A; Gerdov, Marika; Mühl, Bernhard; Perkmann, Thomas; Fae, Ingrid; Wenda, Sabine; Führer, Harald; Henning, Rainer; Valenta, Rudolf; Pickl, Winfried F",Allergy,,424
505878,Education in times of crises: the dilemmas of digital teaching and learning in primary and secondary schools during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared a world pandemic due to COVID-19. In response, most affected countries have enacted measures involving compulsory confinement and restrictions on free movement, which likely influence citizens' lifestyles. This study investigates changes in health risk behaviors (HRBs) with duration of confinement. An online cross-sectional survey served to collect data about the Spanish adult population regarding health behaviors during the first 3 weeks of confinement. A large sample of participants (N = 2,741) (51.8% women; mean age 34.2 years [SD 13.0]) from all Spanish regions completed the survey. Binomial logistic regressions adjusted for socioeconomic characteristics (i.e., gender, age, civil status, education, and occupation), body mass index (BMI), previous HRBs, and confinement context (i.e., solitude and exposure to COVID-19) were conducted to investigate associations between the number of weeks confined and a set of six HRBs (physical activity, alcohol consumption, fresh fruit and vegetable consumption, smoking, screen exposure, and sleep hours). When adjusted, we observed significantly lower odds of experiencing a higher number of HRBs than before confinement overall in a time-dependent fashion: OR 0.63; 95% CI: 0.49–0.81 for the second and OR 0.47; 95% CI: 0.36–0.61 for the third week of confinement. These results were equally consistent in all age and gender subgroup analyses. The present study indicates that changes toward a higher number of HRBs than before confinement, as well as the prevalence of each HRB except screen exposure, decreased during the first 3 weeks of COVID-19 confinement, and thus the Spanish adult population may have adapted to the new situational context by gradually improving their health behaviors.","López-Bueno, Rubén; Calatayud, Joaquín; Casaña, José; Casajús, José A.; Smith, Lee; Tully, Mark A.; Andersen, Lars L.; López-Sánchez, Guillermo F.",Front.

505879,Education in times of crises: the dilemmas of digital teaching and learning in primary and secondary schools during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"INTRODUCTION: The severe disruptions caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus have necessitated a redistribution of resources to meet hospitals' current service needs during this pandemic. The aim is to share our experiences and outcomes during the first month of the Covid-19 pandemic, based on the strategies recommended and strategies we have implemented. METHODS: Our experience comes from our work at a referral hospital within the Spanish National Health System. Changes to clinical practice have largely been guided by the current evidence and four main principles: (1) patient and health-care worker protection, (2) uninterrupted necessary care, (3) conservation of health-care resources, (4) uninterrupted formation for residents. Based on these principles, changes in the service organization, elective clinical visits, emergency visits, surgical procedures, and inpatient and outpatient care were made. RESULTS: Using the guidance of experts, we were able to help the hospital address the demands of the Covid-19 outbreak. We reduced to a third of our orthopaedics and trauma hospital beds, provided coverage for general emergency services, and five ICUs, all continuing to provide care for our patients, in the form of 102 trauma surgeries, 6413 phone interviews and 520 emergency clinic visits. Also in the third week, we were able to restart morning meetings via telematics, and teaching sessions for our residents. On the other hand, eight of the healthcare personnel on our service (10.8%) became infected with Covid-19. CONCLUSIONS: As priorities and resources increasingly shift towards the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible to maintain the high standard and quality of care necessary for trauma and orthopaedics patients while the pandemic persists. We must be prepared to organize our healthcare workers in such a way that the needs of both inpatients and outpatients are met. It is still possible to operate on those patients who need it. Unfortunately, some healthcare workers will become infected. It is essential that we protect those most susceptible to severer consequences of Covid-19. Also crucial are optimized protective measures.","Nuñez, Jorge H; Porcel, Juan Antonio; Pijoan, Joan; Batalla, Lledó; Teixidor, Jordi; Guerra-Farfan, Ernesto; Minguell, Joan",Injury,,424

However, vigilance and awareness of the pandemic in some individuals, epidemic-prevention campaigns, and community-based preventive measures were insufficient. Some citizens subsequently suffered from headaches, anxiety, and mood instability. Furthermore, demographic variables (place of residence, sex, age, and occupation) and physical and mental health status produced various effects on citizens' awareness, attitude, and behavior regarding epidemic prevention as well as the perceived effect of COVID-19 on physical and mental health.","Hsu, Chin-Hsien; Lin, Hsiao-Hsien; Wang, Chun-Chih; Jhang, Shangwun",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),,424

On February 29, 2020, a patient infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) passed away in a hospital in Seattle-King County, the first reported COVID-19-related death in the United States. That same day, a skilled nursing and rehabilitation facility in the county reported that several of its residents tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and that many staff had symptoms compatible with COVID-19.The University of Washington Medicine health system (UW Medicine), which is based in Seattle-King County and provides quaternary care for the region, was one of several health care organizations called upon to address this growing crisis. What ensued was a series of swiftly enacted decisions and activities at UW Medicine, in partnership with local, state, and national public health agencies, to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Tapping into the multipronged mission areas of academic medicine, UW Medicine worked to support the community, innovate in science and clinical practice, lead policy and practice guideline development, and adopt changes as the crisis unfolded. In doing so, health system leaders had to balance their commitments to students, residents and fellows, researchers, faculty, staff, and hospital and health center entities, while ensuring that patients continued to receive cutting edge, high-quality, safe care. In this Invited Commentary, the authors highlight the work and challenges UW Medicine has faced in responding to the global COVID-19 pandemic.","Kim, Christopher S; Lynch, John B; Cohen, Seth; Neme, Santiago; Staiger, Thomas O; Evans, Laura; Pergam, Steven A; Liu, Catherine; Bryson-Cahn, Chloe; Dellit, Timothy H",Acad. med,,424

In addition, severe COVID-19 has been associated with an increased risk of arterial and venous thromboses. In this report, we describe the case of a hemodialysis patient who developed an otherwise-unexplained thrombosis of an arteriovenous fistula during a symptomatic COVID-19 infection. Despite prompt treatment with three technically successful thrombectomies along with systemic intravenous heparin and two rounds of catheter-directed thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator, the fistula rapidly re-thrombosed each time and he required tunneled dialysis catheter placement. He subsequently required admission for hypoxemia from COVID-19 pneumonia and ultimately developed a catheter-related blood stream infection that likely contributed to his death. As the fistula had been previously well functioning and no angiographic explanation for the thrombosis was found, we speculate in this case the recurrent thromboses were related to the hypercoagulable state characteristic of severe COVID-19. Interventionalists performing hemodialysis access procedures should be aware of the prothrombotic state associated with COVID-19 and should consider it when deliberating how to best plan and approach access interventions in patients with symptomatic COVID-19.","Teixeira, Joao Pedro; Combs, Sara A; Owen, Jonathan G",J Vasc Access,,424

515415,"COVID-19 and the Secular Theodicy: On Social Distancing, the Death of God and the Book of Job",2021,"The high prevalence of obesity and obesity-related comorbidities has reached pandemic proportions, particularly in Western countries. Obesity increases the risk to develop several chronic noncommunicable disease, ultimately contributing to reduced survival. Recently, obesity has been recognized as major risk factor for coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19)-related prognosis, contributing to worse outcomes in those with established COVID-19. Particularly, obesity has been associated with higher hospitalization rates in acute or intensive care and greater risk for invasive mechanical ventilation than lean people. Obesity is characterized by metabolic impairments and chronic low-grade systemic inflammation that causes a pro-inflammatory microenvironment, further aggravating the cytokine production and risk of cytokine storm response during Sars-Cov2 sepsis or other secondary infections. Moreover, the metabolic dysregulations are closely related to an impaired immune system and altered response to viral infection that can ultimately lead to a greater susceptibility to infections, longer viral shedding and greater duration of illness and severity of the disease. In individuals with obesity, maintaining a healthy diet, remaining physically active and reducing sedentary behaviors are particularly important during COVID-19-related quarantine to reduce metabolic and immune impairments. Moreover, such stategies are of utmost importance to reduce the risk for sarcopenia and sarcopenic obesity, and to prevent a reduction and potentially even increase cardiorespiratory fitness, a well-known independent risk factor for cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and recently found to be a risk factor also for hospitalizations secondary to COVID-19. Such lifestyle strategies may ultimately reduce morbility and mortality in patients with infectious disease, especially in those with concomitant obesity. The aim of this review is to discuss how obesity might increase the risk of COVID-19 and potentially affect its prognosis once COVID-19 is diagnosed. We therefore advocate for implementation of strategies aimed at preventing obesity in the first place, but also to minimize the metabolic anomalies that may lead to a compromized immune response and chronic low-grade systemic inflammation, especially in patients with COVID-19.","Cava, Edda; Neri, Barbara; Carbonelli, Maria Grazia; Riso, Sergio; Carbone, Salvatore",Clin Nutr,,424

The interactions have been investigated by using molecular docking, quantum chemical and molecular dynamics simulations methods. The molecular structures of all the ligands are studied quantum chemically in terms of their optimized structures, 3-D orbital distributions, global chemical descriptors, molecular electrostatic potential plots and HOMO-LUMO orbital energies. All the ligands show reasonably good binding affinities with nsp-13 protein. The ligand L2 shows to have better binding affinities to Chain A and Chain B of nsp13 protein, which are -6.7 and -6.4 kcal/mol. The study of intermolecular interactions indicates that L2 shows different hydrophobic and hydrogen bond interactions with both chains. Furthermore, molecular dynamic simulations of the nsp13-L2 complex are obtained over a time scale of 60 ns, which indicates its stability and flexibility behavior as assessed in terms of its RMSD and RMSF graphs. The ADMET analysis also shows no violation of Lipinski rule (RO5) by studied phenolic compounds. We believe that the current findings will be further confirmed by in vitro and in vivo studies of these recent phenolic compounds for their potential as inhibitors for SARS-Co-V-2 virus.","Zia, Maimoona; Muhammad, Shabbir; Bibi, Shamsa; Abbasi, Sumra Wajid; Al-Sehemi, Abdullah G; Chaudhary, Aijaz Rasool; Bai, Fu Quan",Bioorg Med Chem Lett,,424

A test-based approach is suggested for de-isolation of these patients. METHODS: The strategy was evaluated by comparing severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load (cycle threshold (Ct) values) and viral culture at the time of hospital discharge in a series of 13 COVID-19 patients: six immunocompetent and seven immunocompromised (five solid organ transplant patients, one lymphoma patient, and one hepatocellular carcinoma patient). RESULTS: Three of the 13 (23%) patients had positive viral cultures: one patient with lymphoma (on day 16) and two immunocompetent patients (on day 7 and day 11). Eighty percent of the patients had negative viral cultures and had a mean Ct value of 20.5. None of the solid organ transplant recipients had positive viral cultures. CONCLUSIONS: The mean Ct value for negative viral cultures was 20.5 in this case series of immunocompromised patients. Unlike those with hematological malignancies, none of the solid organ transplant patients had positive viral cultures. Adopting the test-based approach for all immunocompromised patients may lead to prolonged quarantine. Large-scale studies in disease-specific populations are needed to determine whether a test-based approach versus a symptom-based approach or a combination is applicable for the de-isolation of various immunocompromised patients.","Alshukairi, Abeer N; Tolah, Ahmed M; Dada, Ashraf; Al-Tawfiq, Jaffar A; Almagharbi, Reem S; Saeedi, Mohammed F; Al-Hamzi, Mohammed A; El-Kafrawy, Sherif A; Bahaudden, Husam A; El-Saed, Aiman; Al-Mozaini, Maha A; Khalid, Imran; Hefni, Lama K; Hassan, Ahmed M; Alandijany, Thamir A; Bajrai, Leena H; Bayumi, Daniyah T; Albishi, Ghadeer E; Althawadi, Sahar I; Zabani, Najla A; Perlman, Stanley; Azhar, Esam I",Int J Infect Dis,,424

521758,Digital knowledge sharing and creative performance: Work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic,2021,"In human populations, the relative levels of neutral diversity on the X and autosomes differ markedly from each other and from the naïve theoretical expectation of 3/4. Here we propose an explanation for these differences based on new theory about the effects of sex-specific life history and given pedigree-based estimates of the dependence of human mutation rates on sex and age. We demonstrate that life history effects, particularly longer generation times in males than in females, are expected to have had multiple effects on human X-to-autosome (X:A) diversity ratios, as a result of male-biased mutation rates, the equilibrium X:A ratio of effective population sizes, and the differential responses to changes in population size. We also show that the standard approach of using divergence between species to correct for male mutation bias results in biased estimates of X:A effective population size ratios. We obtain alternative estimates using pedigree-based estimates of the male mutation bias, which reveal that X:A ratios of effective population sizes are considerably greater than previously appreciated. Finally, we find that the joint effects of historical changes in life history and population size can explain the observed X:A diversity ratios in extant human populations. Our results suggest that ancestral human populations were highly polygynous, that non-African populations experienced a substantial reduction in polygyny and/or increase in the male-to-female ratio of generation times around the Out-of-Africa bottleneck, and that current diversity levels were affected by fairly recent changes in sex-specific life history.","Amster, Guy; Murphy, David A; Milligan, William R; Sella, Guy",Proc.

Containment measures were approved soon thereafter. The present study aims at providing a first look at the impact of the containment measures on the outbreak progression in the Veneto region, Italy. METHODS: A Bayesian changepoint analysis was used to identify the changing speed of the epidemic curve. Then, a piecewise polynomial model was considered to fit the data in the first period before the detected changepoint. In this time interval, that is, the weeks from 27 February to 12 March, a quadratic growth was identified by a generalised additive model (GAM). Finally, the model was used to generate the projection of the expected number of hospitalisations at 2 weeks based on the epidemic speed before the changepoint. Such estimates were then compared with the actual outbreak behaviour. RESULTS: The comparison between the observed and predicted hospitalisation curves highlights a slowdown on the total COVID-19 hospitalisations after the onset of containment measures. The estimated daily slowdown effect of the epidemic growth is estimated as 78 hospitalisations per day as of 27 March (95% CI 75 to 81). CONCLUSIONS: The containment strategies seem to have positively impacted the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic outbreak in Veneto.","Gregori, Dario; Azzolina, Danila; Lanera, Corrado; Prosepe, Ilaria; Destro, Nicolas; Lorenzoni, Giulia; Berchialla, Paola",J Epidemiol Community Health,,424

This research examines the gender inequality in agriculture by taking the case of an Eastern European country – Lithuania – as an example. The questionnaire survey was employed in order to check the existence of gender inequality. The study focuses on the young farmers as they are more likely to implement innovations and shape the future agricultural activities. The demand for advisory services and participation in the Common Agricultural Policy measures were used to compare the activities and perceptions of men and women young farmers. We found that there are no significant differences in participation of support measures and demand for advisory services across the genders. This suggests Lithuanian agricultural sector is equally beneficial for men and women young farmers. Given the differences in the educational background, a positive effect is anticipated if women were more empowered in Lithuanian agriculture.

Finally, after further revision, 30 articles were included in the systematic review and 28 used for meta-analysis. Results A total of 28 studies were identified involving 119,883 patients. The mean age of the patients was 38.37 years (95% CI, 36.72 – 40.03) and males comprised 21.4% (95% CI, 12.4 – 34.2) of the population of health workers. The prevalence of HCW who tested positive for COVID-19 is 51.7% (95% CI, 34.7-68.2). The total prevalence of co-morbidities in 7 studies was 18.4% (95% CI, 15.5 – 21.7). The most prevalent symptoms were fever 27.5% (95% CI, 17.6-40.3), cough 26.1% (95% CI, 18.1-36).The prevalence of hospitalization of HCW was 15.1% (95% CI, 5.6-35) in 13 studies and the prevalence of death was 1.5% (95% CI, 0.5-3.9) in 12 studies. Comparisons of HCW with and without infection showed an increased relative risk for COVID-19 related to PPE, workplace setting, profession, exposure, contacts, and testing. Conclusion A significant number of HCW have been reported to be infected with COVID-19 during the first 6 months of the pandemic, with a prevalence of hospitalization of 15.1% and mortality of 1.5%. Further data is needed to track the continued risks in HCW as the pandemic evolves and health systems adapt.","Gholami, Mandana; Fawad, Iman; Shadan, Sidra; Rowaiee, Rashed; Ghanem, HedaietAllah; Omer, Amar; Ho, Hassan Samuel B.",Int J Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33444754/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1201971221000230; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijid.2021.01.013; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971221000230?v=s5,424
590762,Teaching Telemedicine: The Next Frontier for Medical Educators,2021-04-29,"BACKGROUND: The value of frequent, rapid testing to reduce community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE: To define performance standards and predict the clinical, epidemiological, and economic outcomes of nationwide, home-based, antigen testing. DESIGN: A simple compartmental epidemic model estimated viral transmission, clinical history, and resource use, with and without testing. DATA SOURCES: Parameter values and ranges informed by Centers for Disease Control guidance and published literature. TARGET POPULATION: United States population. TIME HORIZON: 60 days. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. Costs include: testing, inpatient care, and lost workdays. INTERVENTION: Home-based SARS-CoV-2 antigen testing. OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative infections and deaths, numbers isolated and/or hospitalized, and total costs. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Without a testing intervention, the model anticipates 15 million infections, 125,000 deaths, and $10.4 billion in costs ($6.5 billion inpatient; $3.9 billion lost productivity) over a 60-day horizon. Weekly availability of testing may avert 4 million infections and 19,000 deaths, raising costs by $21.5 billion. Lower inpatient outlays ($5.9 billion) would partially offset additional testing expenditures ($12.0 billion) and workdays lost ($13.9 billion), yielding incremental costs per infection (death) averted of $5,400 ($1,100,000). RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Outcome estimates vary widely under different behavioral assumptions and testing frequencies. However, key findings persist across all scenarios: large reductions in infections, mortality, and hospitalizations; and costs per death averted roughly an order of magnitude lower than commonly accepted willingness-to-pay values per statistical life saved ($5-17 million). LIMITATIONS: Analysis restricted to at-home testing and limited by uncertainties about test performance. CONCLUSION: High-frequency home testing for SARS-CoV-2 using an inexpensive, imperfect test could contribute to pandemic control at justifiable cost and warrants consideration as part of a national containment strategy.","Paltiel, A.

592568,Virtual Learning Innovations for Continuing Clinical Education during COVID-19,2020-09-30,"The severity of the COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated the search for drugs against SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we explored via in silico approaches myxobacterial secondary metabolites against various receptor-binding regions of SARS-CoV-2 spike which are responsible in recognition and attachment to host cell receptors mechanisms, namely ACE2, GRP78, and NRP1. In general, cyclic depsipeptide chondramides conferred high affinities toward the spike RBD, showing strong binding to the known viral hot spots Arg403, Gln493 and Gln498 and better selectivity compared to most host cell receptors studied. Among them, chondramide C3 (1) exhibited a binding energy which remained relatively constant when docked against most of the spike variants. Chondramide C (2) on the other hand exhibited strong affinity against spike variants identified in the United Kingdom (N501Y), South Africa (N501Y, E484K, K417N) and Brazil (N501Y, E484K, K417T). Chondramide C6 (9) showed highest BE towards GRP78 RBD. Molecular dynamics simulations were also performed for chondramides 1 and 2 against SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD of the Wuhan wild-type and the South African variant, respectively, where resulting complexes demonstrated dynamic stability within a 120-ns simulation time. Protein-protein binding experiments using HADDOCK illustrated weaker binding affinity for complexed chondramide ligands in the RBD against the studied host cell receptors. The chondramide derivatives in general possessed favorable pharmacokinetic properties, highlighting their potential as prototypic anti-COVID-19 drugs limiting viral attachment and possibly minimizing viral infection.

The concentration of PM(2.5), related to air-quality changes, may be associated with perceptible effects on people's health. In this study, computer intelligence was used to assess the negative effects of PM(2.5). The input data, used for the evaluation, were grid definitions (shape-file), PM(2.5), air-quality data, incidence/prevalence rates, a population dataset, and the (Krewski) health-impact function. This paper presents a local (Pakistan) health-impact assessment of PM(2.5) in order to estimate the long-term effects on mortality. A rollback-to-a-standard scenario was based on the PM(2.5) concentration of 15 μg m(−3). Health benefits for a population of about 73 million people were calculated. The results showed that the estimated avoidable mortality, linked to ischemic heart disease and lung cancer, was 2,773 for every 100,000 people, which accounts for 2,024,290 preventable deaths of the total population. The total cost, related to the above mortality, was estimated to be US $ 1,000 million. Therefore, a policy for a PM(2.5)-standard up to 15 μg m(−3) is suggested.","Hassan, Ather; Ilyas, Syed Zafar; Agathopoulos, Simeon; Hussain, Syed Mujtaba; Jalil, Abdul; Ahmed, Sarfraz; Baqir, Yadullah",Heliyon,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e05968; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33665396/,424

They can be targeted by small molecule inhibitors, peptides and peptidomimetics, which represent an alternative to protein therapeutics that carry many disadvantages. In this chapter, I describe specific protein-protein interactions suggested by a novel model of immune signaling, the Signaling Chain HOmoO Ligomerization (SCHOOL) model, to be critical for cell activation mediated by multichain immune recognition receptors (MIRRs) expressed on different cells of the hematopoietic system. Unraveling a long-standing mystery of MIRR triggering and transmembrane signaling, the SCHOOL model reveals the intrareceptor transmembrane interactions and interreceptor cytoplasmic homointeractions as universal therapeutic targets for a diverse variety of disorders mediated by immune cells. Further, assuming that the general principles underlying MIRR-mediated transmembrane signaling mechanisms are similar, the SCHOOL model can be applied to any particular receptor of the MIRR family. Thus, an important application of the SCHOOL model is that global therapeutic strategies targeting key protein-protein interactions involved in MIRR triggering and transmembrane signal transduction may be used to treat a diverse set of immune-mediated diseases. This assumes that clinical knowledge and therapeutic strategies can be transferred between seemingly disparate disorders, such as T-cell-mediated skin diseases and platelet disorders, or combined to develop novel pharmacological approaches. Intriguingly, the SCHOOL model unravels the molecular mechanisms underlying ability of different human viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus to modulate and/or escape the host immune response. It also demonstrates how the lessons learned from viral pathogenesis can be used practically for rational drug design. Application of this model to platelet collagen receptor signaling has already led to the development of a novel concept of platelet inhibition and the invention of new platelet inhibitors, thus proving the suggested hypothesis and highlighting the importance and broad perspectives of the SCHOOL model in the development of new targeting strategies.","Sigalov, Alexander B.",Multichain Immune Recognition Receptor Signaling,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-09789-3_20; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19065798/,424
593160,Enhancing workplace learning at the transition into practice. Lessons from a pandemic,2020-05-16,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Diabetes is a chronic metabolic condition characterized by hyperglycemia and is associated with several complications. Prevalence of Diabetes in adult population in India ranges from 10.9 to 14.2% in urban area and 3.0–7.8% in rural area. Glycemic control is an important factor in preventing the complications associated with diabetes. HBA1c is the indicator of long-term glycemic control and slight variation in it significantly alters the risk of diabetic complications. Thus, the aim of this study was to study the change in HBA1c levels due to lock down in patients with diabetes. METHODS: 307 patients with diabetes who had attended our endocrine OPD in last 3 months before nationwide 68 days lockdown from 24 March 2020 to 31 May 2020, and had recent HBA1c report in past and willing to participate were included in the study after informed consent from 2nd June 2020 to 14th June 2020 when first phase of Unlock started, to identify the change in HBA1c levels during the lockdown period in our patients with diabetes. RESULTS: The patients were aged between 25–69 years and male to female ratio was 181:126 (1.44: 1). The mean age and mean duration of diabetes in our patients was 55.68 years and 7.95 years respectively. Increment of 0.51% was seen in mean HBA1c levels in our patient from 7.92% mean pre-lockdown HBA1c to mean of 8.43% after release of lock down. CONCLUSION: Glycemic control got deranged during lockdown period with significant increase of mean HBA1c by 0.51% in immediate post lock down period which may significantly increase the annual incidence of complications related to diabetes.","Khare, Jaideep; Jindal, Sushil",Prim Care Diabetes,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pcd.2020.12.003; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33419712/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1751991820303624; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1751991820303624,424

These interventions were successful in containing the outbreak and ultimately eliminating community transmission of COVID-19. The timing of interventions is crucial to their success. Delaying interventions for too long may both reduce their effectiveness and mean that they need to be maintained for a longer period of time. Here, we use a stochastic branching process model of COVID-19 transmission and control to simulate the epidemic trajectory in New Zealand and the effect of its interventions during its COVID-19 outbreak in March-April 2020. We use the model to calculate key outcomes, including the peak load on the contact tracing system, the total number of reported COVID-19 cases and deaths, and the probability of elimination within a specified time frame. We investigate the sensitivity of these outcomes to variations in the timing of the interventions. We find that a delay to the introduction of Alert Level 4 controls results in considerably worse outcomes. Changes in the timing of border measures have a smaller effect. We conclude that the rapid response in introducing stay-at-home orders was crucial in reducing the number of cases and deaths and increasing the probability of elimination.","Binny, R. N.; Baker, M.

First, we screened and excluded equine plasma that cross‐reacted with any model virus, a procedure not published before for antivenoms. In addition, we evaluated for the first time the virucidal capacity of phenol applied to SAI products. Among the steps analyzed in the process, phenol addition was the most effective one, followed by heat, caprylic acid, and pepsin. All viruses were fully inactivated only by phenol treatment; heat, the second most effective step, did not inactivate the rotavirus and the adenovirus used.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spreads via droplets and close contact from person to person, and there has been an increased concern regarding aerosol drug delivery due to the potential aerosolizing of viral particles. To date, little focus has been given to aerosol drug delivery to patients with COVID-19 treated at home to minimize their hospital utilization. Since most hospitals were stressed with multiple admissions and experienced restricted healthcare resources in the era of COVID-19 pandemic, treating patients with COPD at home became essential to minimize their hospital utilization. However, guidance on how to deliver aerosolized medications safely and effectively to this patient population treated at home is still lacking.

It remains a global public health issue that presents a major challenge to chronic disease prevention and health into adulthood. Schools have a rich opportunity to improve youth health and tackle obesity, yet they face barriers in fulfilling this function. This study investigated school stakeholders’ beliefs and perceptions of the barriers and enablers currently experienced by schools, as well as their recommendations towards preventing adolescent obesity. A sequential explanatory mixed-methods study design was utilised with surveys administered for the quantitative phase and individual interviews for the qualitative phase. Descriptive statistics and inductive thematic analyses were utilised for the survey and interview data, respectively. Triangulation of findings from the quantitative and qualitative phases aided in the better understanding and integration of the overall results. In total, 60 school stakeholders (52 subject teachers, 3 senior teachers and 5 heads of department) from both independent and public high schools in Queensland, Australia responded to the survey, while 14 respondents participated in the interviews. The main perceived causes of obesity were poor eating habits and sedentary lifestyle. Highlighted barriers were busy timetables, shortage of trained staff and funding, lack of robustness in the introduction and implementation of school interventions and insufficient motivation of learners to participate in obesity prevention programs. Enabling factors included parental support, easy access to fitness equipment during recess, supportive government policies, provision of healthier school tuck shop menu options and elimination of sugary drinks from vending machines. A model for the prevention of adolescent obesity was developed based on participants’ perceptions. Tripartite collaboration between the school, government and parents was perceived as fundamental to preventing adolescent obesity. Strategies targeting nutrition, physical activity and overall health, including parental education on health, formal health talks in schools by health professionals and better-targeted advertisement encouraging healthy lifestyle choices, were identified as essential for improved adolescent health outcomes.","Buru, Kakale; Emeto, Theophilus I.; Malau-Aduli, Aduli E.

OBJECTIVE: Develop a model that uses administrative and clinical data within 24 h of transfer to predict 30-day in-hospital mortality at an Academic Health Center (AHC). DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. We used 30 putative variables in a multiple logistic regression model in the full data set (n = 10,389) to identify 20 candidate variables obtained from the electronic medical record (EMR) within 24 h of admission that were associated with 30-day in-hospital mortality (p < 0.05). These 20 variables were tested using multiple logistic regression and area under the curve (AUC)–receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis to identify an optimal risk threshold score in a randomly split derivation sample (n = 5194) which was then examined in the validation sample (n = 5195). PARTICIPANTS: Ten thousand three hundred eighty-nine patients greater than 18 years transferred to the Indiana University (IU)–Adult Academic Health Center (AHC) between 1/1/2016 and 12/31/2017. MAIN MEASURES: Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, C-statistic, and risk threshold score of the model. KEY RESULTS: The final model was strongly discriminative (C-statistic = 0.90) and had a good fit (Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test [X(2) (8) =6.26, p = 0.62]). The positive predictive value for 30-day in-hospital death was 68%; AUC-ROC was 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.89–0.92, p < 0.0001). We identified a risk threshold score of −2.19 that had a maximum sensitivity (79.87%) and specificity (85.24%) in the derivation and validation sample (sensitivity: 75.00%, specificity: 85.71%). In the validation sample, 34.40% (354/1029) of the patients above this threshold died compared to only 2.83% (118/4166) deaths below this threshold.

606252,Child Welfare Services Response to COVID-19: Addressing Face-to-Face Contacts,2021-06-16,"Recent case studies have highlighted that certain immunocompromised individuals are at risk for prolonged SARS-CoV-2 replication, intra-host viral evolution of multiply-mutated variants, and poor clinical outcomes. The immunologic determinants of this risk, the duration of infectiousness, and optimal treatment and prevention strategies in immunocompromised hosts are ill-defined. Of additional concern is the widespread use of immunosuppressive medications (corticosteroids, IL-6 antagonists) to treat COVID-19, which may enhance and prolong viral replication in the context of immunodeficiency. We outline the rationale for four inter-related approaches to usher in an era of evidence-based medicine for optimal management of immunocompromised patients with COVID-19: 1) multicenter pathogenesis and outcomes studies to relate the risk of severe disease to the type and degree of immunodeficiency; 2) studies evaluating immunologic responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines; 3) studies evaluating the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies for primary prophylaxis; and 4) clinical trials of novel antiviral agents for the treatment of COVID-19.","Haidar, Ghady; Mellors, John W",Clin Infect Dis,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33949644/; https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciab397,424

Although disparities in access to telemedicine by age and socioeconomic status (SES) have been well-documented, evidence is limited as to how these disparities changed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the equity of patient access to telemedicine has been scarcely reported in Japan, despite the huge potential for telemedicine expansion. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate changes due to age and SES disparities in telemedicine use during the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan. METHODS: Using data from a large internet survey conducted between August 25 and September 30, 2020, in Japan, we examined the associations of participant age and SES (educational attainment, urbanicity of residence, and income level) with their telemedicine use in the following two time periods during the pandemic: April 2020 and August-September 2020. RESULTS: Of the 24,526 participants aged 18 to 79 years (50.8% [n=12,446] women), the proportion of individuals who reported using telemedicine increased from 2.0% (n=497) in April 2020 to 4.7% (n=1159) in August-September 2020. After adjusting for potential confounders, younger individuals were more likely to use telemedicine than older individuals in April 2020. Although this pattern persisted in August-September 2020, we also observed a substantial increase in telemedicine use among individuals aged 70 to 79 years (adjusted rates, 0.2% in April 2020 vs 3.8% in August-September 2020; P<.001 after multiple comparisons). We found disparities in telemedicine use by SES in August-September 2020 that did not exist in April 2020. In August-September 2020, individuals with a university degree were more likely to use telemedicine than those with a high school diploma or less (adjusted rates, 6.6% vs 3.5%; P<.001). Individuals living in urban areas exhibited higher rates of telemedicine use than those living in rural areas only in August-September 2020 (adjusted rates, 5.2% vs 3.8%; P<.001). Disparities in telemedicine use by income level were not observed in either time period. CONCLUSIONS: In general, younger individuals increased their use of telemedicine compared to older individuals during the pandemic, although individuals in their 70s also increased their use of telemedicine. Disparities in telemedicine use by educational attainment and urbanicity of residence widened during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Miyawaki, Atsushi; Tabuchi, Takahiro; Ong, Michael K; Tsugawa, Yusuke",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/27982; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34259641/,424
608369,Reflection on passive immunotherapy in those who need most: some novel strategic arguments for obtaining safer therapeutic plasma or autologous antibodies from recovered COVID ‐19 infected patients,2020-05-14,"We have analyzed the ability of three molecular clones of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) and an ex vivo variant to infect nine distinct specific-pathogen-free feline cell lines in tissue culture. The purpose of these studies was to elucidate mechanisms by which host cells regulate the level of virus infection and expression and to assess host cell cytokine responses to virus infection. Cells used for the analyzes included four IL-2-dependent continuous T-cell lines (104-C1, 104-C7, MCH5-4 and DB FeTs) which arose from long-term passage, followed by limiting dilution cloning of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs); two IL-2-independent T-cell lines (104-C1DL and MCH5-4DL) which originated from two of the IL-2-dependent lines, 104-C1 and MCH5-4; respectively; Crandell feline kidney cells (CrFK); G355-5 brain-derived glial cells; and the T-cell lymphoma line, 3201. Cells were infected with FIV-PPR, FIV-34TF10, FIV 34TF10orf2rep, and a variant arising from FIV-PPR during ex vivo passage on 104-C1DL cells, termed FIV-PPRglial. Infection of the IL-2-dependent T-cell line, 104-C1, by FIV-PPR resulted in the specific and distinct upregulation of cytokine expression. In particular, these cells doubled their expression of the pleiotropic cytokines, interleukin-4 and interleukin-12 after FIV infection. Interferon-γ production also increased after infection with FIV whereas, TNFα expression remained constant. Also, a marked upregulation of MHC class II expression was noted post infection of MCH5-4 and 104-C1 cells with FIV-PPR. Similar results were obtained after infection with FIV-34TF10orf2rep, indicating that the upregulation of cytokine expression is not an isolate-specific phenomenon. Changes in cytokine and class II expression are similar to various reports for the in vivo cytokine alterations in FIV, SIV and HIV infections. The ex vivo infection of these cell lines offers a manipulable system to examine the mechanism(s) by which lentiviruses alter cytokine expression.","Lerner, Danica L.; Grant, Chris K.; de Parseval, Aymeric; Elder, John H.",Vet Immunol Immunopathol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9839880/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0165242798001627; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165242798001627,424

This study establishes the antibacterial effect of the novel bioactive substance “S-PRG filler” on oral bacteria. We examined the state of oxidative stress caused by the six types of ions released in eluate from the S-PRG filler in oral bacterial cells. Moreover, we investigated the effects of these ions on the growth and pathogenicity of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. We found that the released ions affected SOD amount and hydrogen peroxide in bacterial cells insinuating oxidative stress occurrence. In bacterial culture, growth inhibition was observed depending on the ion concentration in the medium. Additionally, released ions suppressed Streptococcus mutans adhesion to hydroxyapatite, S. oralis neuraminidase activity, and Porphyromonas gingivalis hemagglutination and gingipain activity in a concentration-dependent manner. From these results, it was suggested that the ions released from the S-PRG filler may suppress the growth and pathogenicity of the oral bacterial flora. This bioactive material is potentially useful to prevent the onset of diseases inside and outside of the oral cavity, which in turn may have possible applications for oral care and QOL improvement.","Kono, Yu; Tamura, Muneaki; Cueno, Marni E.; Tonogi, Morio; Imai, Kenichi",Antibiotics (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics10070816; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34356737/,424
608847,Mining relationships between transmission clusters from contact tracing data: An application for investigating COVID-19 outbreak,2021-09-08,"HEV is the most causative agent of acute viral hepatitis globally. HEV causes acute, chronic, and extrahepatic manifestations. Chronic HEV infection develops in immunocompromised patients such as organ transplant patients, HIV-infected patients, and leukemic patients. The source of chronic HEV infection is not known. Also, the source of extrahepatic manifestations associated with HEV infection is still unclear. Hepatotropic viruses such as HCV and HBV replicate in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and these cells become a source of chronic reactivation of the infections in allograft organ transplant patients. Herein, we reported that PBMCs and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs), isolated from healthy donors (n = 3), are susceptible to HEV in vitro. Human monocytes (HMOs), human macrophages (HMACs), and human BMDMs were challenged with HEV-1 and HEV-3 viruses. HEV RNA was measured by qPCR, the marker of the intermediate replicative form (ds-RNA) was assessed by immunofluorescence, and HEV capsid protein was assessed by flow cytometry and ELISA. HEV infection was successfully established in primary HMOs, HMACs, and human BMDMs, but not in the corresponding cells of murine origin. Intermediate replicative form (ds RNA) was detected in HMOs and HMACs challenged with HEV. The HEV load was increased over time, and the HEV capsid protein was detected intracellularly in the HEV-infected cells and accumulated extracellularly over time, confirming that HEV completes the life cycle inside these cells. The HEV particles produced from the infected BMDMs were infectious to naive HMOs in vitro. The HEV viral load was comparable in HEV-1- and HEV-3-infected cells, but HEV-1 induced more inflammatory responses. In conclusion, HMOs, HMACs, and human BMDMs are permissive to HEV infection and these cells could be the source of chronic and recurrent infection, especially in immunocompromised patients. Replication of HEV in human BMDMs could be related to hematological disorders associated with extrahepatic manifestations.","Sayed, Ibrahim M.; Seddik, Mohamed Ismail; Gaber, Marwa A.; Saber, Saber H.; Mandour, Sahar A.; El-Mokhtar, Mohamed A.",Vaccines (Basel),https://doi.org/10.3390/vaccines8020239; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32455708/,424

Understanding populations at heightened risk of acquisition is essential to more effectively target outreach and prevention efforts. Objective To compare sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of pregnant women with and without SARS-CoV2 infection and, among those with SARS-CoV2, to compare characteristics of those who reported COVID-19 symptoms and those who were asymptomatic at diagnosis. Study Design This retrospective cohort study includes pregnant women who delivered or intended to deliver at Northwestern Memorial Hospital after initiation of a universal testing protocol on admission (April 8, 2020 - May 31, 2020). Women were dichotomized by whether they tested positive for SARS-CoV2. Among women who tested positive, women were further dichotomized by whether they endorsed symptoms of COVID-19. Bivariable analysis, and non-parametric tests of trend were used for analyses. Logistic regression was used to control for potential confounders as well as to examine effect modification between race and ethnicity and any other identified risk factors. Results During the study period, 1,418 women met inclusion criteria, of whom 101 (7.1%) tested positive for SARS-CoV2. Of the 101 women who tested positive, 77 (76.2%) were symptomatic at the time of diagnosis. Compared to women who tested negative for SARS-CoV2, women who tested positive were younger and were more likely to have public insurance, to identify as Black/African-American or Latina, to be unmarried, to be obese, have pre-existing pulmonary disease, and have living children. An increasing number of living children was associated with an increasing risk of SARS-CoV2 infection and this finding persisted after controlling for potential confounders. There was no effect modification between race or ethnicity and having living children with regard to the risk of infection. There were no significant differences identified between women who were symptomatic and asymptomatic. Conclusion Many risk factors for SARS-CoV2 infection in pregnancy are similar to the social and structural determinants of health that have been reported in the general population. The observed association between SARS-CoV2 infection and having children raises the possibility of children themselves as vectors of viral spread or behavior patterns of parents as mediators of acquisition.","SAKOWICZ, Allie; AYALA, Alexander E.; UKEJE, Chideraa C.; WITTING, Celeste S.; GROBMAN, William A.; MILLER, Emily S.",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2589933320301543; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589933320301543?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32838274/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajogmf.2020.100198,424

Methods : A cross-sectional design was used. Eighty-one Chinese patients with cancer were recruited in December 2020. The Brief Pain Inventory, the Pain Management Inventory, and the Pain Self-efficacy Questionnaire were used to evaluate patients’ pain and self-management status. Descriptive statistical analysis and multiple linear regression models were conducted for the research aims. Results : Two thirds of the participants experienced moderate to severe pain. Cancer pain had moderate to severe interference on 90.12% of patients’ lives. Self-management of pain in these participants was low. The most commonly used methods of pain management included adjusting activity intensity to avoid fatigue, using distraction techniques, and massaging the sore area. The most effective methods to manage pain included taking analgesics prescribed by doctor, taking over-the-counter analgesics, and massaging the sore area. Fifteen patients (18.5%) believed that the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on pain management and 26 patients (32.1%) needed support.

Life expectancy is a widely used indicator that provides a clear and cross-nationally comparable picture of the population-level impacts of the pandemic on mortality. METHODS: Life tables by sex were calculated for 29 countries, including most European countries, Chile and the USA, for 2015–2020. Life expectancy at birth and at age 60 years for 2020 were contextualized against recent trends between 2015 and 2019. Using decomposition techniques, we examined which specific age groups contributed to reductions in life expectancy in 2020 and to what extent reductions were attributable to official COVID-19 deaths. RESULTS: Life expectancy at birth declined from 2019 to 2020 in 27 out of 29 countries. Males in the USA and Lithuania experienced the largest losses in life expectancy at birth during 2020 (2.2 and 1.7 years, respectively), but reductions of more than an entire year were documented in 11 countries for males and 8 among females. Reductions were mostly attributable to increased mortality above age 60 years and to official COVID-19 deaths. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 pandemic triggered significant mortality increases in 2020 of a magnitude not witnessed since World War II in Western Europe or the breakup of the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe.

Methods: We performed a systematic review of studies that explored pre-existing CVD and its traditional risk factors as risk factors of severe COVID-19 (defined as death, acute respiratory distress syndrome, mechanical ventilation, or intensive care unit admission). We searched PubMed and Embase for papers in English with original data (≥10 cases of severe COVID-19). Using random-effects models, we pooled relative risk (RR) estimates and conducted meta-regression analyses. Results: Of the 661 publications identified in our search, 25 papers met our inclusion criteria, with 76,638 COVID-19 patients including 11,766 severe cases. Older age was consistently associated with severe COVID-19 in all eight eligible studies, with RR >~5 in >60-65 vs. <50 years. Three studies showed no change in the RR of age after adjusting for covariate(s). In univariate analyses, factors robustly associated with severe COVID-19 were male sex (10 studies; pooled RR=1.73, [95%CI 1.50-2.01]), hypertension (8 studies; 2.87 [2.09-3.93]), diabetes (9 studies; 3.20 [2.26-4.53]), and CVD (10 studies; 4.97 [3.76-6.58]). RR for male sex was likely to be independent of age. For the other three factors, meta-regression analyses suggested confounding by age. Only four studies reported multivariable analysis, but most of them showed adjusted RR ~2 for hypertension, diabetes, and CVD. No study explored renin-angiotensin system inhibitors as a risk factor for severe COVID-19. Conclusions: Despite the potential for confounding, these results suggest that hypertension, diabetes, and CVD are independently associated with severe COVID-19 and, together with age and male sex, can be used to inform objective decisions on COVID-19 testing, clinical management, and workforce planning.","Matsushita, Kunihiro; Ding, Ning; Kou, Minghao; Hu, Xiao; Chen, Mengkun; Gao, Yumin; Honda, Yasuyuki; Dowdy, David; Mok, Yejin; Ishigami, Junichi; Appel, Lawrence J",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.05.20054155,424

In the absence of effective vaccines, it is mandatory to find effective treatments with low adverse effects able to treat hospitalized patients with COVID-19 disease. In this work, we determined the existence of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells within the CD45RA− T memory cells from the blood of convalescent donors. Memory T cells can respond quickly to the infection and provide long-term immune protection to reduce the severity of the COVID-19 symptoms. Also, CD45RA− memory T cells confer protection from other pathogens the donors encountered in their life. This is vital to clear other secondary infections usually developed in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. SARS-CoV-2 specific memory T cells were found within all the CD45RA− subsets CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and in the central memory and effector memory subpopulations.

620384,Mitigation of COVID-19 using social distancing of the elderly in Brazil: The vertical quarantine effects in hospitalizations and deaths,2021-01-15,"Advances in video conferencing capabilities combined with dramatic socio-dynamic shifts brought about by COVID-19, have redefined the ways in which humans interact in modern society. From business meetings to medical exams, or from classroom instruction to yoga class, virtual interfacing has permeated nearly every aspect of our daily lives. A seemingly endless stream of technological advances combined with our newfound reliance on virtual interfacing makes it likely that humans will continue to use this modern form of social interaction into the future. However, emergent evidence suggests that virtual interfacing may not be equivalent to face-to-face interactions. Ultimately, too little is currently understood about the mechanisms that underlie human interactions over the virtual divide, including how these mechanisms differ from traditional face-to-face interaction. Here, we propose functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) hyperscanning—simultaneous measurement of two or more brains—as an optimal approach to quantify potential neurocognitive differences between virtual and in-person interactions. We argue that increased focus on this understudied domain will help elucidate the reasons why virtual conferencing doesn't always stack up to in-person meetings and will also serve to spur new technologies designed to improve the virtual interaction experience. On the basis of existing fNIRS hyperscanning literature, we highlight the current gaps in research regarding virtual interactions. Furthermore, we provide insight into current hurdles regarding fNIRS hyperscanning hardware and methodology that should be addressed in order to shed light on this newly critical element of everyday life.","Balters, Stephanie; Baker, Joseph M.; Hawthorne, Grace; Reiss, Allan L.",Front Hum Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2020.588494; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33240067/,424
621609,The orthopaedic experience of COVID-19: A literature review,2021-02-08,"We propose to use ambient sound as a privacy-aware source of information for COVID-19-related social distance monitoring and contact tracing. The aim is to complement currently dominant Bluetooth Low Energy Received Signal Strength Indicator (BLE RSSI) approaches. These often struggle with the complexity of Radio Frequency (RF) signal attenuation, which is strongly influenced by specific surrounding characteristics. This in turn renders the relationship between signal strength and the distance between transmitter and receiver highly non-deterministic. We analyze spatio-temporal variations in what we call “ambient sound fingerprints”. We leverage the fact that ambient sound received by a mobile device is a superposition of sounds from sources at many different locations in the environment. Such a superposition is determined by the relative position of those sources with respect to the receiver. We present a method for using the above general idea to classify proximity between pairs of users based on Kullback–Leibler distance between sound intensity histograms. The method is based on intensity analysis only, and does not require the collection of any privacy sensitive signals. Further, we show how this information can be fused with BLE RSSI features using adaptive weighted voting. We also take into account that sound is not available in all windows. Our approach is evaluated in elaborate experiments in real-world settings. The results show that both Bluetooth and sound can be used to differentiate users within and out of critical distance (1.5 m) with high accuracies of 77% and 80% respectively. Their fusion, however, improves this to 86%, making evident the merit of augmenting BLE RSSI with sound. We conclude by discussing strengths and limitations of our approach and highlighting directions for future work.","Bahle, Gernot; Fortes Rey, Vitor; Bian, Sizhen; Bello, Hymalai; Lukowicz, Paul",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34451046/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21165604,424

AIMS: The current study's aim was to determine the prevalence of psychological distress and post-traumatic stress symptoms in the Greek population during the first COVID-19 lockdown, and to detect potential correlates. METHOD: An anonymous online survey was conducted between 10 April and 4 May 2020, to collect information regarding people's psychological functioning and COVID-19-related perceptions. RESULTS: A total of 1443 individuals completed the survey; 293 (20%) reported clinically significant anxiety symptoms, 188 (12.9%) reported clinically significant depressive symptoms and 506 (36.4%) suffered from definite post-traumatic stress disorder. Anxiety symptoms were independently associated with female gender (β = 1.281, 95% CI 0.808–1.755, P < 0.001), educational level (β = −1.570, 95% CI −2.546 to −0.595, P = 0.002), perceived severity (β = −1.745, 95% CI −3.146 to −0.344, P = 0.015) and COVID-19-related worry (β = 7.633, 95% CI 6.206–9.060, P < 0.001). Depressive symptoms were strongly correlated with educational level (β = −1.298, 95% CI −2.220 to −0.377, P = 0.006), perceived severity (β = −1.331, 95% CI −2.579 to −0.082, P = 0.037) and COVID-19-related worry (β = 4.102, 95% CI 2.769–5.436, P < 0.001). Finally, post-traumatic stress symptoms were linked to female gender (β = 6.451, 95% CI 4.602–8.299, P < 0.001), educational level (β = −5.737, 95% CI −9.479 to −1.996, P = 0.003), psychiatric history (β = −4.028, 95% CI −6.274 to −1.782, P < 0.001) and COVID-19-related worry (β = 23.865, 95% CI 18.201–29.530, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A significant percentage of the population reported clinically important anxiety, depressive and post-traumatic stress symptoms. Women, less-educated individuals and people with a psychiatric history appeared more vulnerable to the pandemic's psychological impact.","Karaivazoglou, Katerina; Konstantopoulou, Georgia; Kalogeropoulou, Maria; Iliou, Theodoros; Vorvolakos, Theofanis; Assimakopoulos, Konstantinos; Gourzis, Philippos; Alexopoulos, Panagiotis",BJPsych Open,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33622422/; https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2021.17,424

METHODS: A retrospective study conducted at King Saud University Medical City, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia using electronic health records. The vaccination statuses of all children who were scheduled for vaccinations at birth and at 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months during March, April and May between 2017 and 2020 were included in the study with total sample of 15,870 children, and comparisons between the cohorts were performed. RESULTS: All vaccination visits during April and May 2020 were below the lower extremes except for the birth vaccinations. In March, April, and May 2020 there were respective drops in vaccination visits of 49.93%, 71.90% and 68.48% compared with the mean numbers of vaccination visits during the same months from 2017 to 2019. In comparisons of mean numbers of visits from March 2017 to May 2019 and March to May in 2020, the respective reductions in visits for birth and 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12-month vaccinations were 16.5%, 80.5%, 74.7%, 72.9%, 80.0% and 74.1%.

The RegenMed Development Organization (ReMDO), through its RegeneratOR Workforce Development Initiative, has taken on this challenge beginning with an assessment of regenerative medicine (RM) biomanufacturing knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) needed for successful employment. While STW often refers only to associate degree or other prebaccalaureate prepared technicians, the RM biomanufacturing survey included responses related to baccalaureate prepared technicians. Three levels of preparation were articulated in the research: basic employability skills, core bioscience skills, and RM biomanufacturing technical skills. The first two of these skill levels have been defined by previous research and are generally accepted as foundational—the Common Employability Skills developed by the National Network of Business and Industry Associations and the Core Skill Standards for Bioscience Technicians developed by the National Center for the Biotechnology Workforce. Fifteen skill sets addressing the specialized needs of RM and related biotechnology sectors were identified in the ReMDO survey, defining a third level of KSAs needed for entry‐level employment in RM biomanufacturing. The purpose of the article is to outline the KSAs necessary for RM biomanufacturing, quantify the skills gap that currently exists between skills required by employers and those acquired by employees and available in the labor market, and make recommendations for the application of these findings.","Green, Gary M.; Read, Russ H.; Lee, Sengyong; Tubon, Thomas; Hunsberger, Joshua G.; Atala, Anthony",Stem Cells Transl Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34164942/; https://doi.org/10.1002/sctm.21-0037,424

628169,"Why We Are Not Acting to Save Ourselves: ACT, Health, and Culture",2021-07-15,"Background: Psychological stressors like panic, fear, phobia, etc., are being substantially reported during the COVID-19 outbreak. In the prior outbreaks, fear of being infected was reported as the prominent suicide stressor. Therefore, fear of infection has become a concern in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic because it worsens emotion, cognition, and behavioral responses. Understanding the extent of fear of COVID-19 infection in various cohorts would aid in gauging the mental health services, which was a remedy in the present review. Methods: Adhering to Arksey and O'Malley's framework for conducting a scoping review, a systematic search was performed in the month of September 2020 in several databases, including Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, etc. Considering the inclusion criteria, a total of 14 articles were included in the present review. Results: All of the included studies were conducted via online platforms, whereas all but one of the studies were cross-sectional in nature (including a mixed-method study, and a comparative study). Most of the studies were conducted among the general population (n = 12), within March and May 2020 (n = 9), from Asian countries (n = 7), and considered a self-developed item for fear of COVID-19 assessment (n = 8; whereas the Fear of COVID-19 Scale was used in 6-studies). The prevalence of fear of COVID-19 was reported to be 18.1–45.2%, although no cutoff point or criteria was mentioned for such a prevalence estimation of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale. However, females, younger adults, urban residents, divorcees, healthcare workers, those in quarantine settings, those in suspicion of being infected, and those with mental health problems, etc., were found to be at an increased risk of COVID-19 fear. Conclusions: Being one of the first reviews in this context, the findings are anticipated to be helpful to predict the possible solutions for reducing fear of COVID-19 and facilitate further studies on strategies of how to alleviate such a stressful situation.","Quadros, Shalini; Garg, Shalini; Ranjan, Rupesh; Vijayasarathi, Guruprasad; Mamun, Mohammed A.",Front Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2021.708430; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34557117/,424

Population growth, the depletion of natural resources coupled with mismanagement, and sharp fluctuations in prices of those resources are among the main reasons for sub-optimal economic performance. Some resource-rich countries have been expending effort and money in an attempt to change this inverse relationship (a.k.a. “the resource curse”) by designing policies to diversify their economies with high value-added industries and sectors. Qatar is a such country and point of the interest in this article. Qatar's political and economic structure, its efforts to diversify its economy, and the potential for improved entrepreneurial outcomes with high value-added products, services, businesses, and industries are analyzed. The country has been very effective in maximizing the benefits of its oil resources and especially its large natural gas reserves, becoming the largest exporter of liquefied natural gas (LNG) in the world. Revenues from oil and gas sales have been invested in the domestic economy and global assets. Thus far, however, it has not shown the in-house capacity for innovation and entrepreneurship critical for sustainable economic diversification going forward.

Herbals are consumed as such, or as food supplements, whose consumption has recently increased. However, these products are not exempt from adverse effects and pharmacological interactions, presenting a special risk in aged, polymedicated individuals. Understanding pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions is warranted to avoid undesirable adverse drug reactions, which may result in unwanted side-effects or therapeutic failure. The present study reviews the potential interactions between selected bioactive compounds (170) used by seniors for cognitive enhancement and representative drugs of 10 pharmacotherapeutic classes commonly prescribed to the middle-aged adults, often multimorbid and polymedicated, to anticipate and prevent risks arising from their co-administration. A literature review was conducted to identify mutual targets affected (inhibition/induction/substrate), the frequency of which was taken as a measure of potential interaction. Although a limited number of drugs were studied, from this work, interaction with other drugs affecting the same targets may be anticipated and prevented, constituting a valuable tool for healthcare professionals in clinical practice.","Auxtero, Maria D.; Chalante, Susana; Abade, Mário R.; Jorge, Rui; Fernandes, Ana I.",Pharmaceutics,https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics13010124; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33478035/,424

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Consecutive patients enrolled at PGIMER Chandigarh were stratified on the basis of disease severity as group I (moderate-to-severe disease including oxygen saturation <94% on room air or those with comorbidities) (n= 35) and group II (mild disease, with oxygen saturation >94% and without comorbidities) (n=49). Hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal, thyroid, gonadal axes, and lactotroph function were evaluated. Inflammatory and cell-injury markers were also analysed. RESULTS: Patients in group I had higher prevalence of hypocortisolism (38.5 vs 6.8%, p=0.012), lower ACTH (16.3 vs 32.1pg/ml, p=0.234) and DHEAS (86.29 vs 117.8µg/dl, p= 0.086) as compared to group II. Low T3 syndrome was a universal finding, irrespective of disease severity. Sick euthyroid syndrome (apart from low T3 syndrome) (80.9 vs 73.1%, p= 0.046) and atypical thyroiditis (low T3, high T4, low or normal TSH) (14.3 vs 2.4%, p= 0.046) were more frequent in group I than group II.

Therefore, this study aims to determine the efficacy of gefitinib and methotrexate in patients with advanced-stage or recurrent head and neck cancer. Methodology: Two hundred patients of age >18 years with advanced clinical stage either IVA or IVB and recurrent cases were included in this study. Patients were randomly allocated to the gefitinib (n=100) or methotrexate (n=100) group. Each patient was evaluated for demographic variables, addictions, comorbidities and history of cancer followed by clinical and radiological evaluation. Treatment response was evaluated with standard Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). The primary end point of the study was overall response rate (ORR). SPSS version 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used to analyze data. Results: Overall response of therapy was partial 11% vs 8%, stable disease 52% vs 40%, and progressive disease 33% vs 40% in gefitinib and methotrexate groups respectively. Three patients were lost to follow up in the gefitinib group and one patient in the methotrexate group. Only one death was reported in the gefitinib group and four in the methotrexate group. In recurrent cases, six patients treated with gefitinib showed partial response whereas no case of partial response was reported in the methotrexate group (27.3% vs 0%). Similarly, in the methotrexate group significantly higher numbers of progressive and stable diseases were reported for recurrent cases than in the gefitinib group (p=0.045). Discussion: Gefitinib had marginally better results in terms of overall response and safety as compared to methotrexate, specifically in recurrent cases of head and neck cancer. This benefit for recurrent cases and ease of administration, leading to fewer hospital visits in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era, makes gefitinib superior to methotrexate.","Irshad, Razia; Haider, Ghulam; Hashmi, Madiha; Hassan, Anusha",Cureus,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34262802/; https://doi.org/10.7759/cureus.15451,424

In this study, we report on quantitative and qualitative alterations of hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYPs) and the pharmacokinetics of CYP-metabolizing drugs, with a focus on four CYP isoforms (CYP1A2, CYP2C11, CYP2E1 and CYP3A2), after Hb-V resuscitation from a massive hemorrhage. The results of proteome analysis and western blot data indicate that resuscitation with both Hb-V and packed RBC (PRBC) resulted in a decrease in the protein levels of CYPs. Along with a decrease in the protein expression of CYPs, pharmacokinetic studies showed that the elimination of CYP-metabolizing drugs was prolonged in the Hb-V and PRBC resuscitation groups. It is also noteworthy that the CYP-metabolizing drugs in the Hb-V resuscitation group was retained for a longer period compared to the PRBC resuscitation group, and this is attributed to the CYP isoforms having a lower metabolic activity in the Hb-V resuscitation group than that for the PRBC resuscitation group. These findings suggest that resuscitation with Hb-V after a massive hemorrhage has a slight but not clinically significant effect on drug metabolism via CYPs in the liver due to decreased protein levels and the metabolic activity with respect to the CYPs.","Tokuno, Masahiro; Taguchi, Kazuaki; Sakai, Hiromi; Ohtsuki, Sumio; Yamasaki, Keishi; Otagiri, Masaki",Drug Metab Pharmacokinet,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1347436720303773; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1347436720303773?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32792327/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dmpk.2020.06.004,424
631935,The outbreak of COVID‐19 pandemic and its impact on stock market volatility: Evidence from a worst‐affected economy,2021-02-11,"Bile duct injury (BDI) is a dangerous complication of cholecystectomy, with significant postoperative sequelae for the patient in terms of morbidity, mortality, and long-term quality of life. BDIs have an estimated incidence of 0.4–1.5%, but considering the number of cholecystectomies performed worldwide, mostly by laparoscopy, surgeons must be prepared to manage this surgical challenge. Most BDIs are recognized either during the procedure or in the immediate postoperative period. However, some BDIs may be discovered later during the postoperative period, and this may translate to delayed or inappropriate treatments. Providing a specific diagnosis and a precise description of the BDI will expedite the decision-making process and increase the chance of treatment success. Subsequently, the choice and timing of the appropriate reconstructive strategy have a critical role in long-term prognosis. Currently, a wide spectrum of multidisciplinary interventions with different degrees of invasiveness is indicated for BDI management. These World Society of Emergency Surgery (WSES) guidelines have been produced following an exhaustive review of the current literature and an international expert panel discussion with the aim of providing evidence-based recommendations to facilitate and standardize the detection and management of BDIs during cholecystectomy. In particular, the 2020 WSES guidelines cover the following key aspects: (1) strategies to minimize the risk of BDI during cholecystectomy; (2) BDI rates in general surgery units and review of surgical practice; (3) how to classify, stage, and report BDI once detected; (4) how to manage an intraoperatively detected BDI; (5) indications for antibiotic treatment; (6) indications for clinical, biochemical, and imaging investigations for suspected BDI; and (7) how to manage a postoperatively detected BDI.

632837,"Illegal trade in local markets of Feuang and Mad districts of Vientiane Province, Lao people's Democratic Republic.",2020-09-01,"These best practice recommendations for ENT consultations during the COVID-19 pandemic have been drawn up because ENT examinations and treatments are at risk of contamination by the SARS-Cov-2 virus in certain instances. Thus, ENT specialists are among the professionals who are most exposed to this infection. During the pandemic, insofar as an asymptomatic patient may be infected and contagious, the same precautions must be employed whether the patient is ill with, suspected of having, or without any clinical evidence of COVID-19 infection. According to the scientific data available, the examinations and procedures potentially exposing to projections/aerosolizations of organic material of human origin are considered to be at risk of staff contamination. For ENT examinations and procedures without exposure to such projections/aerosolizations, the professional is advised to a long sleeve clean outfit, a surgical mask and gloves in case of contact with the patient's mucosa. ENT examinations and procedures with exposure to these projections/aerosolizations require the so-called “airborne”, “contact”, and “droplets” additional precautions: FFP2/N95 respiratory protection device, eye protection, disposable headwear and long sleeve overgown.","Lescanne, E.; van der Mee-Marquet, N.; Juvanon, J.-M.; Abbas, A.; Morel, N.; Klein, J.-M.; Hanau, M.; Couloigner, V.",Eur Ann Otorhinolaryngol Head Neck Dis,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879729620301265?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32419879/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anorl.2020.05.007; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1879729620301265,424

METHODS: We assessed peripheral blood gene expression in 53 adults with confirmed SARS-CoV-2-infection clinically adjudicated as having mild, moderate or severe disease. Supervised principal components analysis was used to build a weighted gene expression risk score (WGERS) to discriminate between severe and non-severe COVID. RESULTS: Gene expression patterns in participants with mild and moderate illness were similar, but significantly different from severe illness. When comparing severe versus non-severe illness, we identified >4000 genes differentially expressed (FDR<0.05). Biological pathways increased in severe COVID-19 were associated with platelet activation and coagulation, and those significantly decreased with T cell signaling and differentiation. A WGERS based on 18 genes distinguished severe illness in our training cohort (cross-validated ROC-AUC=0.98), and need for intensive care in an independent cohort (ROC-AUC=0.85). Dichotomizing the WGERS yielded 100% sensitivity and 85% specificity for classifying severe illness in our training cohort, and 84% sensitivity and 74% specificity for defining the need for intensive care in the validation cohort. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that gene expression classifiers may provide clinical utility as predictors of COVID-19 illness severity.","Peterson, Derick R; Baran, Andrea M; Bhattacharya, Soumyaroop; Branche, Angela R; Croft, Daniel P; Corbett, Anthony M; Walsh, Edward E; Falsey, Ann R; Mariani, Thomas J",bioRxiv,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34462743/; https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.24.457521,424

It is a lethal hematologic condition due to a dysregulated immune response which results in inappropriately activated macrophages damaging host tissues. Based on the etiology, HLH can be primary (genetic) or secondary (acquired). The most common cause of a secondary HLH is an infection. Viral infections are the most common cause of secondary HLH. Among the viral causes of secondary HLH, Epstein–Barr virus is the most common etiologic agent. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common causative pathogen in the immunocompromised host but is rare in an immunocompetent adult. In infection- associated secondary HLH, treatment includes antimicrobial therapy. HLH carries a high mortality and morbidity rate as it is an underdiagnosed clinical condition. Successful early diagnosis allows for adequate time for curative therapy. Treatment for HLH includes chemotherapy, immunomodulators, and a hematopoietic stem-cell transplant. The 2004 diagnostic criteria set by Histiocyte Society serves as a guide to make an earlier clinical diagnosis. A review of PubMed literature revealed only five reported cases of CMV-induced HLH. We describe the sixth case of CMV pneumonitis-induced HLH and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion in a 72-year-old White male. He was treated successfully with oral valganciclovir and corticosteroids.","Patil, Sachin M.; Beck, Phillip Paul; Patel, Tarang Pankaj; Hunter, Michael P; Johnson, Jeremy; Acevedo, Bran Andres; Roland, William",IDCases,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.idcr.2020.e00972; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214250920302808?v=s5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33024698/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S2214250920302808,424

Ethiopia is one of developing countries estimated to have high prevalence of visual impairment which have an enormous socio-economic impact. Also there is limited available information regarding with the magnitude of visual impairment among adults in our country at large and east Gojjam zone in specific. Therefore the aim of this study was to assess the magnitude of visual impairment and its associated factors among patients attending Debre Markos Referral Hospital ophthalmic clinics in east Gojjam zone, North West Ethiopia. METHODS: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted at Debre Markos Referral Hospital which is the only hospital in east gojjam zone with ophthalmic care service from March 1 to 30, 2020 by using systematic random sampling technique to select study participants after informed consent was obtained. Data were collected by interview with 5% pretested, structured questionnaire and ocular examinations. Data were cleaned, coded and entered to Epi-data version-3.1, and analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science software version 26. The descriptive statistics was presented in tables, text and graphs. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify factors associated with visual impairment was conducted. Covariates with P-value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A study was conducted among 312 study participants with 96% response rate. The magnitude of visual impairment was 114 (36.5%) [95% CI, (33.8, 39.2%)]. Age > 50 years [AOR = 3.82; 95% CI (1.56, 9.35)], rural residency [AOR = 4.33 95% CI (1.30, 14.44)], inability to read and write [AOR = 3.21; 95% CI (1.18, 8.73)] and Cataract [AOR = 4.48; 95% CI (1.91, 10.52)] were factors significantly associated with visual impairment. CONCLUSIONS: The overall magnitude of visual impairment was found to be high. Older age, rural residency, inability to read and write and cataract were associated with visual impairment. Increasing literacy, expanded cataract surgery, as well as community based visual acuity screening especially for elders and rural residents is crucial. Zonal police makers should give emphasis on prevention of visual impairment to decrease economic, social and political burden of visual disability.

Anecdotally, we know that EHR integration is a complex and time-consuming task; yet, the process has not been examined in detail. As part of an implementation project, we examined the work involved in integrating an encounter PDA for symptomatic uterine fibroids into Epic EHR systems. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the steps and time required to integrate a PDA into the Epic EHR system and examine facilitators and barriers to the integration effort. METHODS: We conducted a case study at 5 academic medical centers in the United States. A clinical champion at each institution liaised with their Epic EHR team to initiate the integration of the uterine fibroid Option Grid PDAs into clinician-facing menus. We scheduled regular meetings with the Epic software analysts and an expert Epic technologist to discuss how best to integrate the tools into Epic for use by clinicians with patients. The meetings were then recorded and transcribed. Two researchers independently coded the transcripts and field notes before categorizing the codes and conducting a thematic analysis to identify the facilitators and barriers to EHR integration. The steps were reviewed and edited by an Epic technologist to ensure their accuracy. RESULTS: Integrating the uterine fibroid Option Grid PDA into clinician-facing menus required an 18-month timeline and a 6-step process, as follows: task priority negotiation with Epic software teams, security risk assessment, technical review, Epic configuration; troubleshooting, and launch. The key facilitators of the process were the clinical champions who advocated for integration at the institutional level and the presence of an experienced technologist who guided Epic software analysts during the build. Another facilitator was the use of an emerging industry standard app platform (Health Level 7 Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies on Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) as a means of integrating the Option Grid into existing systems. This standard platform enabled clinicians to access the tools by using single sign-on credentials and prevented protected health information from leaving the EHR. Key barriers were the lack of control over the Option Grid product developed by EBSCO (Elton B Stephens Company) Health; the periodic Epic upgrades that can result in a pause on new software configurations; and the unforeseen software problems with Option Grid (ie, inability to print the PDA), which delayed the launch of the PDA. CONCLUSIONS: The integration of PDAs into the Epic EHR system requires a 6-step process and an 18-month timeline. The process required support and prioritization from a clinical champion, guidance from an experienced technologist, and a willing EHR software developer team.","Scalia, Peter; Ahmad, Farhan; Schubbe, Danielle; Forcino, Rachel; Durand, Marie-Anne; Barr, Paul James; Elwyn, Glyn",J Med Internet Res,https://doi.org/10.2196/22766; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33938806/,424
640180,COVID-19: Fear of pandemic and short-term IPO performance,2021-02-12,"Viruses manipulate cell biology to utilize monocytes/macrophages as vessels for dissemination, long-term persistence within tissues and virus replication. Viruses enter cells through endocytosis, phagocytosis, macropinocytosis or membrane fusion. These processes play important roles in the mechanisms contributing to the pathogenesis of these agents and in establishing viral genome persistence and latency. Upon viral infection, monocytes respond with an elevated expression of proinflammatory signalling molecules and antiviral responses, as is shown in the case of the influenza, Chikungunya, human herpes and Zika viruses. Human immunodeficiency virus initiates acute inflammation on site during the early stages of infection but there is a shift of M1 to M2 at the later stages of infection. Cytomegalovirus creates a balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory processes by inducing a specific phenotype within the M1/M2 continuum. Despite facilitating inflammation, infected macrophages generally display abolished apoptosis and restricted cytopathic effect, which sustains the virus production. The majority of viruses discussed in this review employ monocytes/macrophages as a repository but certain viruses use these cells for productive replication. This review focuses on viral adaptations to enter monocytes/macrophages, immune escape, reprogramming of infected cells and the response of the host cells.","Nikitina, Ekaterina; Larionova, Irina; Choinzonov, Evgeniy; Kzhyshkowska, Julia",Int J Mol Sci,https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms19092821; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30231586/,424

We previously showed that IFITM3 degradation is increased by its ubiquitination, though the ubiquitin ligase responsible for this modification remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4 ubiquitinates IFITM3 in cells and in vitro. This IFITM3 ubiquitination is dependent upon the presence of a PPxY motif within IFITM3 and the WW domain-containing region of NEDD4. In NEDD4 knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts, we observed defective IFITM3 ubiquitination and accumulation of high levels of basal IFITM3 as compared to wild type cells. Heightened IFITM3 levels significantly protected NEDD4 knockout cells from infection by influenza A and B viruses. Similarly, knockdown of NEDD4 in human lung cells resulted in an increase in steady state IFITM3 and a decrease in influenza virus infection, demonstrating a conservation of this NEDD4-dependent IFITM3 regulatory mechanism in mouse and human cells. Consistent with the known association of NEDD4 with lysosomes, we demonstrate for the first time that steady state turnover of IFITM3 occurs through the lysosomal degradation pathway. Overall, this work identifies the enzyme NEDD4 as a new therapeutic target for the prevention of influenza virus infections, and introduces a new paradigm for up-regulating cellular levels of IFITM3 independently of IFN or infection.","Chesarino, Nicholas M.; McMichael, Temet M.; Yount, Jacob S.",PLoS Pathog,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26263374/; https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005095,424
640605,Time to include pandemic preparedness training to healthcare curriculum,2020-09-14,"BACKGROUND: Two conflicting hypotheses as to how breast cancer (BC) accesses the systemic circulation dominated the 20th century and affected surgical treatment. We hypothesized that tumor lymphovascular invasion (LVI) at the primary tumor site favors lymphatic and not blood vessel, capillaries, and systemic metastases (Smets) are dependent upon regional lymph node (RLN) mets. METHODS: Data from BC patients undergoing RLN biopsy was professionally abstracted and maintained in a prospective, precisely managed, single-institution database. Associations of RLN, LVI, and Smets were estimated by univariate and multivariate backward logistic regression models and patient-affiliated demographic, clinicopathologic, treatment type, and molecular marker data. RESULTS: Of 3329 patients, followed 1–22 years (mean 7.8), 463 of 3329 (13.9%) showed LVI, 742 of 3329 (22.3%) had RLN mets, and 262 of 3329 (7.9%) had Smets. Smets occurred in 52 of 252 (21% with LVI+/RLN+); 116 of 2301 (5% with LVI−/RLN−); 65 of 465 (14% with LVI−/RLN+); and 17 of 207 (8% with LVI+/RLN−), p = 0.021 for association between LVI and Smets for RLN+ patients but not for RLN− patients (p = 0.051). Positive RLN, larger tumor size, and higher grade (all p < 0.001) were predictive of Smets by the multivariable model, whereas positive LVI was not. CONCLUSIONS: LVI predicts RLN mets in BC. RLN is critical to Smets from BC, whereas LVI on its own is not. Smets occur significantly more commonly when both LVI and RLN mets occur together. LVI is, thus, likely to be primarily lymphatic invasion, and rarely, blood vessel invasion, supporting the Halsted paradigm. LVI and RLN together predict clinical outcome better than either alone.

643812,Reflection of connectivism in medical education and learning motivation 4 during COVID-19,2020-07-08,"Since the outbreak of COVID-19, governments have turned their attention to digital contact tracing. In many countries, public debate has focused on the risks this technology poses to privacy, with advocates and experts sounding alarm bells about surveillance and mission creep reminiscent of the post 9/11 era. Yet, when Apple and Google launched their contact tracing API in April 2020, some of the world’s leading privacy experts applauded this initiative for its privacy-preserving technical specifications. In an interesting twist, the tech giants came to be portrayed as greater champions of privacy than some democratic governments. This article proposes to view the Apple/Google API in terms of a broader phenomenon whereby tech corporations are encroaching into ever new spheres of social life. From this perspective, the (legitimate) advantage these actors have accrued in the sphere of the production of digital goods provides them with (illegitimate) access to the spheres of health and medicine, and more worrisome, to the sphere of politics. These sphere transgressions raise numerous risks that are not captured by the focus on privacy harms. Namely, a crowding out of essential spherical expertise, new dependencies on corporate actors for the delivery of essential, public goods, the shaping of (global) public policy by non-representative, private actors and ultimately, the accumulation of decision-making power across multiple spheres. While privacy is certainly an important value, its centrality in the debate on digital contact tracing may blind us to these broader societal harms and unwittingly pave the way for ever more sphere transgressions.","Sharon, Tamar",Ethics Inf Technol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32837287/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10676-020-09547-x,424

Coincident with a natural outbreak of MHV at our institution, we noted alterations in immunoglobulin secretion by mature Peyer's patch B cells under an inductive stimulus provided by dendritic cells and mitogen-activated T cells (DC-T). MHV was isolated from mice affected during the outbreak, and experimental infection of mice with the isolate consistently resulted in failures of immunoglobulin secretion by cocultures of Peyer's patch DC-T and B cells. In subsequent experiments, MHV appeared to negatively affect DC-T more than B cells. Therefore, the effects of inapparent MHV infection on experimental mucosal immune responses can result from natural infection and can be experimentally reproduced.","Casebolt, Donald B.; Spalding, David M.; Schoeb, Trenton R.; Lindsey, J.Russell",Cellular Immunology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0008874987902954; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2820590/; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/0008874987902954,424

The aim of this study was, therefore, to evaluate the awareness and adherence of the Saudi population to these measures. METHODS: A web-based questionnaire was designed with 16 questions (eight questions related to demographics, three related to the awareness of social distancing (stay-at-home) and five related to the overall practice of social distancing). RESULTS: A total of 5105 participants completed the survey [58.4% females, 66.3% young individuals (aged 18–37 years), 55.8% bachelor degree holders and 51.0% from the western region]. The Saudi Ministry of Health (MOH) was the main source of information about COVID-19 for most of the participants (78.2%). High awareness (81.3%) regarding stay-at-home was observed, associated mainly with female participants, those from the middle region and those with a high education and income. The overall implementation of social distancing was satisfactory (score 3.13/5), with 37.8% never leaving home during the stay-at-home period. Better adherence to social distancing was observed among female participants, higher degree holders and those aged over 38 years. CONCLUSION: Organised plans by the Saudi MOH have been effective in raising awareness and improving the practice of social distancing among public. However, the observed lower practice of social distancing by individuals with a lower education and income indicates the need for targeted interventions to achieve better outcomes.","Aldarhami, Abdu; Bazaid, Abdulrahman S; Althomali, Omar W; Binsaleh, Naif K",Int J Gen Med,https://doi.org/10.2147/ijgm.s269716; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33061535/,424

We have recently shown that 21 aa substitutions and a 7-aa insert in the N-terminal region of S are associated with the extended host range of a virus variant derived from murine cells persistently infected with the A59 strain of MHV (MHV-A59). We used targeted RNA recombination (TRR) to generate isogenic viruses that differ from MHV-A59 by the 21 aa substitutions or the 7-aa insert in S. Only viruses with both the 21 aa substitutions and the 7-aa insert in S infected hamster, feline, and monkey cells. These viruses also infected murine cells in the presence of blocking anti-mCEACAM1a antibodies. Thus, relatively few changes in the N-terminal region of S1 are sufficient to permit MHV-A59 to interact with alternative receptors on murine and non-murine cells.","Thackray, Larissa B; Holmes, Kathryn V",Virology,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682204002387; https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S0042682204002387; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15207636/,424
654276,Analysis of the Summer Season Home Range of Domestic Feral Cats ( Felis catus ) - Focused on the Surroundings of Rural and Suburban Areas,2013-09-30,"BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis, which is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. The C-type lectin DC-SIGN is known to be the major M. tuberculosis receptor on human dendritic cells. We reasoned that if DC-SIGN interacts with M. tuberculosis, as well as with other pathogens, variation in this gene might have a broad range of influence in the pathogenesis of a number of infectious diseases, including tuberculosis. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We tested whether polymorphisms in CD209, the gene encoding DC-SIGN, are associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis through sequencing and genotyping analyses in a South African cohort. After exclusion of significant population stratification in our cohort, we observed an association between two CD209 promoter variants (−871G and −336A) and decreased risk of developing tuberculosis. By looking at the geographical distribution of these variants, we observed that their allelic combination is mainly confined to Eurasian populations. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations suggest that the two −871G and −336A variants confer protection against tuberculosis. In addition, the geographic distribution of these two alleles, together with their phylogenetic status, suggest that they may have increased in frequency in non-African populations as a result of host genetic adaptation to a longer history of exposure to tuberculosis. Further characterization of the biological consequences of DC-SIGN variation in tuberculosis will be crucial to better appreciate the role of this lectin in interactions between the host immune system and the tubercle bacillus as well as other pathogens.","Barreiro, Luis B; Neyrolles, Olivier; Babb, Chantal L; Tailleux, Ludovic; Quach, Hélène; McElreavey, Ken; van Helden, Paul D.; Hoal, Eileen G; Gicquel, Brigitte; Quintana-Murci, Lluis",PLoS Med,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16379498/,424

658641,"Teaching Physical Education in the COVID-19 Context: Pedagogical Content, Organization, and Challenge of Health Education: (General Aspect and Illustration of the Case in Morocco)",2021,"Research on ethical leadership generally falls into two categories: one celebrates individual leaders and their ‘authentic’ personalities and virtuous stewardship of organizations; the other decries toxic leaders or individuals in positions of power who exhibit ‘dark’ personality traits or dubious morals. Somewhere between these extremes, leadership is ‘done’ by imperfect human beings who try to avoid violating their own ethical standards while at the same time navigating the realities of social and organizational life. This paper discusses the concept of ‘Moral Recovery’ as an ethical leadership process that begins in moral failure, but enables eventual personal, organizational, and social change. It builds on the concept of ‘Moral Injury’ from the work of the psychiatrist Johnathan Shay and refers to the experiences of armed service personnel traumatized by experiences where either they, or their leaders, violated their own values. ‘Morally injured’ parties recover their sense of wellbeing through engaging with restorative communal actions which address the social causes of unethical practices. The process of Moral Recovery requires restorative communal actions which address the social causes of unethical practices. This paper will outline the concept of ‘Moral Recovery’ as a form of practical ethical leadership and change. It will illustrate its relevance to ethical leadership practice with reference to one high-profile case; Ray Anderson of Interface. As this paper is primarily conceptual, avenues for future research are identified, and implications for teaching practice are discussed.","Cullen, John G.",J Bus Ethics,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33110279/; https://doi.org/10.1007/s10551-020-04658-3,424

666077,Resuming cadaver dissection during a pandemic,2020-10-27,"For an emerging disease like COVID-19, systems immunology tools may quickly identify and quantitatively characterize cells associated with disease progression or clinical response. With repeated sampling, immune monitoring creates a real-time portrait of the cells reacting to a novel virus before disease-specific knowledge and tools are established. However, single cell analysis tools can struggle to reveal rare cells that are under 0.1% of the population. Here, the machine learning workflow Tracking Responders EXpanding (T-REX) was created to identify changes in both rare and common cells across human immune monitoring settings. T-REX identified cells with highly similar phenotypes that localized to hotspots of significant change during rhinovirus and SARS-CoV-2 infections. Specialized MHCII tetramer reagents that mark rhinovirus-specific CD4+ cells were left out during analysis and then used to test whether T-REX identified biologically significant cells. T-REX identified rhinovirus-specific CD4+ T cells based on phenotypically homogeneous cells expanding by ≥95% following infection. T-REX successfully identified hotspots of virus-specific T cells by comparing infection (day 7) to either pre-infection (day 0) or post-infection (day 28) samples. Plotting the direction and degree of change for each individual donor provided a useful summary view and revealed patterns of immune system behavior across immune monitoring settings. For example, the magnitude and direction of change in some COVID-19 patients was comparable to blast crisis acute myeloid leukemia patients undergoing a complete response to chemotherapy. Other COVID-19 patients instead displayed an immune trajectory like that seen in rhinovirus infection or checkpoint inhibitor therapy for melanoma. The T-REX algorithm thus rapidly identifies and characterizes mechanistically significant cells and places emerging diseases into a systems immunology context for comparison to well-studied immune changes.","Barone, Sierra M; Paul, Alberta GA; Muehling, Lyndsey M; Lannigan, Joanne A; Kwok, William W; Turner, Ronald B; Woodfolk, Judith A; Irish, Jonathan M",eLife,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34350827/; https://doi.org/10.7554/elife.64653,424

Albeit we know that VDR expression is reduced in the mucosal epithelial layers of autoimmune diseases, the mechanism by which VDR is decreased remains elusive. METHODS: VDR and zinc finger protein 36 (ZFP36) levels in human samples and cell lines were detected by real-time PCR, western blot and immunostaining. Luciferase report assay was used to test cis-elements in VDR gene promoter, real-time PCR was applied to measure mRNA decay and western blot was performed to evaluate protein degradation. RNA affinity chromatography assay was used to test protein-mRNA interaction. Co-immunoprecipitation was used to detect protein–protein interaction. The role of ZFP36 in AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of VDR mRNA was also measured by luciferase report assay. RESULTS: We identify ZFP36 can bind with the AREs in the 3’UTR of VDR mRNA, leading to mRNA degradation in oral and colonic epithelial cells under inflammatory circumstance. Either ZFP36 protein or AREs of VDR mRNA mutation abolishes this protein-mRNA binding process. After the key amino acid’s mutation, ZFP36 fails to decrease VDR mRNA expression. We also find that VDR physically binds with Y box-binding protein 1 (YBX-1) to block YBX-1’s nuclear translocation and ameliorate cell death in the presence of inflammation. CONCLUSION: These findings provide insights into the cause of VDR decrease in oral and colonic epithelial cells under inflammatory condition and explain how VDR maintains cell viability in these cells.

These include CoVs that cause severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) and severe acute diarrhea syndrome (SADS). Bats that are naturally infected or experimentally infected do not demonstrate clinical signs of disease. These observations have allowed researchers to speculate that bats are the likely reservoirs or ancestral hosts for several CoVs. In this review, we follow the CoV outbreaks that are speculated to have originated in bats. We review studies that have allowed researchers to identify unique adaptation in bats that may allow them to harbor CoVs without severe disease. We speculate about future studies that are critical to identify how bats can harbor multiple strains of CoVs and factors that enable these viruses to “jump” from bats to other mammals. We hope that this review will enable readers to identify gaps in knowledge that currently exist and initiate a dialogue amongst bat researchers to share resources to overcome present limitations.","Banerjee, Arinjay; Kulcsar, Kirsten; Misra, Vikram; Frieman, Matthew; Mossman, Karen",Viruses,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30634396/; https://doi.org/10.3390/v11010041,424

In three studies, one conducted several years before the pandemic, and two during the pandemic, we showed that facial expressions of emotions are used as signals of health status. Specifically, happy expressers are perceived as healthier than expressers showing negative emotions or neutrality (Studies 1–3), whereas anger was interpreted as a signal of ill health (Study 3). Importantly, however, facial expressions affected health perception only when there was a prior reason to suspect ill health. This was the case for older expressers before and after the pandemic for whom age-related stereotypes set expectations of ill health and for all ages during a wide-spread pandemic, which extends this suspicion to everyone. In Study 3, we showed that the effect of emotion expressions was also generalized to the physical distance that the observer wishes to keep from the expresser.

However, current evidences have not identified asthma in the top 10 comorbidities associated with COVID-19 fatalities. It raises the question that why patients with different type of asthma are not more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection like other respiratory infection. Increased number of eosinophils and elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expressions in asthma are supposed as two mechanisms which associated with decreased COVID-19 susceptibility in asthmatics. Some studies have been performed to evaluate two mentioned factors in asthmatic patients compared with healthy individuals.

By substituting residues in RaTG13 RBD with their counterparts in SARS-CoV-2 RBD, we found that residue 501, the major position found in VOCs 501Y.V1/V2/V3, plays a key role in determining the potential host range of RaTG13. We also found that SARS-CoV-2 could induce strong cross-reactive antibodies to RaTG13 and identified a SARS-CoV-2 MAb, CB6, that could cross-neutralize RaTG13 pseudovirus.

The extraordinary interhuman transmission of this disease has urged scientists to examine the various facets of its pathogenic agent, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Herein, based on publicly available genomic data, we analyzed the codon usage co-adaptation profiles of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory coronaviruses (CoVs) with their human host, identified CoV-responsive human genes and their functional roles on the basis of both the relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU)-based correlation of viral genes with human genes and differential gene expression analysis, and predicted potential drugs for COVID-19 treatment based on these genes. The relatively high codon adaptation index (CAI) values (>0.70) signposted the gene expressivity efficiency of CoVs in human. The ENc-GC3 plot indicated that SARS-CoV-2 genome was under strict selection pressure while SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV were under selection and mutational pressures. The RSCU-based correlation analysis indicated that the viral genomes shared similar codons with a panoply of human genes. The merging of RSCU-based correlation data and SARS-CoV-2-responsive differentially expressed genes allowed the identification of human genes potentially affected by SARS-CoV-2 infection. Functional enrichment analysis indicated that these genes were enriched in biological processes and pathways related to host response to viral infection and immune response. Using the drug-gene interaction database, we screened a list of drugs that could target these genes as potential COVID-19 therapeutics. Our findings not only will contribute in vaccine development but also provide a useful set of drugs that could guide practitioners in strategical monitoring of COVID-19. We recommend practitioners to scrupulously screen this list of predicted drugs in order to authenticate those qualified for treating COVID-19 symptoms.","Nambou, Komi; Anakpa, Manawa",Infect Genet Evol,https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/pii/S1567134820303026; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32707288/; https://doi.org/10.1016/j.meegid.2020.104471; https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1567134820303026?v=s5,424

An increase of each interquartile range in PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, O3 and CO at lag4 corresponded to 1.40 (1.37-1.43), 1.35 (1.32-1.37), 1.01 (1.00-1.02), 1.08 (1.07-1.10), 1.28 (1.27-1.29) and 1.26 (1.24-1.28) odds ratios (ORs) of daily COVID-19 confirmed new cases, respectively. For 1 oc, 1% and 1 m/s increase in temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity, the ORs were 0.97 (0.97-0.98), 0.96 (0.96-0.97), and 0.94 (0.92-0.95), respectively. The estimates of PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and all meteorological factors remained statistically significant after meta-analysis for the five selected regions. The exposure-response relationships showed that higher concentrations of air pollutants and lower meteorological factors were associated with daily COVID-19 confirmed new cases increasing. Conclusions: Higher air pollutant concentrations and lower temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity may favor COVID-19 transmission. As summer months are arriving in the Northern Hemisphere, the environmental factors and implementation of public health control measures may play an optimistic role in controlling COVID-19 epidemic.","Cao, H.; Li, B.; Gu, T.; Liu, X.; Meng, K.; ZHANG, L.",,https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.24.20138867; http://medrxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2020.06.24.20138867v1?rss=1,424
674662,Increasing Social Media Presence for Graduate Medical Education Programs,2021,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a significant public health problem globally, which causes difficulty and trouble for both people’s travel and public transport companies’ management. Improving the accuracy of bus passenger flow prediction during COVID-19 can help these companies make better decisions on operation scheduling and is of great significance to epidemic prevention and early warnings. This research proposes an improved STL-LSTM model (ISTL-LSTM), which combines seasonal-trend decomposition procedure based on locally weighted regression (STL), multiple features, and three long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks. Specifically, the proposed ISTL-LSTM method consists of four procedures. Firstly, the original time series is decomposed into trend series, seasonality series, and residual series through implementing STL. Then, each sub-series is concatenated with new features. In addition, each fused sub-series is predicted by different LSTM models separately. Lastly, predicting values generated from LSTM models are combined in a final prediction value. In the case study, the prediction of daily bus passenger flow in Beijing during the pandemic is selected as the research object. The results show that the ISTL-LSTM model could perform well and predict at least 15% more accurately compared with single models and a hybrid model. This research fills the gap of bus passenger flow prediction under the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic and provides helpful references for studies on passenger flow prediction.","Jiao, Feng; Huang, Lei; Song, Rongjia; Huang, Haifeng",Sensors (Basel),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34502841/; https://doi.org/10.3390/s21175950,424

This was inevitably bound to affect our Breast Unit, dilating both pre- and post-operative times. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect on patients' flow of organizational and logistic changes (key interventions) based on lean thinking implemented after the COVID-19 outbreak. Materials and Methods: Clinical and demographic data were retrospectively collected from patients undergoing sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer at the Verona University Hospital from January 2018 to June 2020. Patients enrolled (n = 341) were divided into two groups according to date of admission: before (Group A; n = 294) and after (Group B; n = 47) the implementation of key interventions. Each case in Group B was subsequently matched 1:1 by means of case-control matching with cases from Group A for age, comorbidities, and type of surgery (Subgroup A1; N = 47). Pre-admission time (T0) and length of stay (T1) were compared between the three groups. Results: Median T0 was 312 h, whereas median T1 was 24 h. Patients in Group B had a higher frequency of comorbidities (57.4 vs. 25.2%, p = 0.001) and underwent mastectomy more often than patients in Group A (61.7 vs. 36.7%, p = 0.001). Both median T0 and T1 were higher in group B than in group A (384 vs. 300 h, p = 0.001, 48 vs. 24 h, p = 0.001, respectively). Median T0 and T1 did not significantly differ between Group B and Subgroup A1 (all p > 0.05). Conclusions: Lean thinking and new technologies could prove useful to the optimization of preoperative and postoperative times during the current pandemic, minimizing healthcare personnel and patients' exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and promoting a rational use of limited resources, while complying with oncological principles.","Pellini, Francesca; Di Filippo, Giacomo; Mirandola, Sara; Deguidi, Giulia; Filippi, Elisa; Pollini, Giovanni Paolo",Front Surg,https://doi.org/10.3389/fsurg.2021.582980; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33791333/,424
675341,ABA Finding Its Heart During a Pandemic: An Exploration in Social Validity,2020-10-16,"Since December 2019, Coronavirus disease‐19 (COVID‐19) has spread rapidly across the world, leading to a global effort to develop vaccines and treatments. Despite extensive progress, there remains a need for treatments to bolster the immune responses in infected immunocompromised individuals, such as cancer patients who recently underwent a haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Immunological protection against COVID‐19 is mediated by both short‐lived neutralising antibodies and long‐lasting virus‐reactive T cells. Therefore, we propose that T cell therapy may augment efficacy of current treatments. For the greatest efficacy with minimal adverse effects, it is important that any cellular therapy is designed to be as specific and directed as possible. Here, we identify T cells from COVID‐19 patients with a potentially protective response to two major antigens of the SARS‐CoV‐2 virus, Spike and Nucleocapsid protein. By generating clones of highly virus‐reactive CD4(+) T cells, we were able to confirm a set of 9 immunodominant epitopes and characterise T cell responses against these. Accordingly, the sensitivity of T cell clones for their specific epitope, as well as the extent and focus of their cytokine response was examined. Moreover, by using an advanced T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing approach, we determined the paired TCRαβ sequences of clones of interest. While these data on a limited population require further expansion for universal application, the results presented here form a crucial first step towards TCR‐transgenic CD4(+) T cell therapy of COVID‐19.","Verhagen, Johan; van der Meijden, Edith D.; Lang, Vanessa; Kremer, Andreas E.; Völkl, Simon; Mackensen, Andreas; Aigner, Michael; Kremer, Anita N.",Clin Exp Immunol,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34061349/; https://doi.org/10.1111/cei.13627,424
675775,"The Zombie Virus Pandemic: An Innovative Simulation Integrating Virology, Population Health, and Bioethics for Preclinical Medical Students",2020-11-12,"IMPORTANCE: Claims that spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) can improve immune function have increased substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic and may have contributed to the rapid spread of both accurate and inaccurate information (referred to as an infodemic by the World Health Organization). OBJECTIVE: To identify, appraise, and synthesize the scientific literature on the efficacy and effectiveness of SMT in preventing the development of infectious disease or improving disease-specific outcomes in patients with infectious disease and to examine the association between SMT and selected immunological, endocrine, and other physiological biomarkers. EVIDENCE REVIEW: A literature search of MEDLINE, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, the Index to Chiropractic Literature, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Embase was conducted from inception to April 15, 2020. Randomized clinical trials and cohort studies were included. Eligible studies were critically appraised, and evidence with high and acceptable quality was synthesized using the Synthesis Without Meta-Analysis guideline. FINDINGS: A total of 2593 records were retrieved; after exclusions, 50 full-text articles were screened, and 16 articles reporting the findings of 13 studies comprising 795 participants were critically appraised. The literature search found no clinical studies that investigated the efficacy or effectiveness of SMT in preventing the development of infectious disease or improving disease-specific outcomes among patients with infectious disease. Eight articles reporting the results of 6 high- and acceptable-quality RCTs comprising 529 participants investigated the effect of SMT on biomarkers. Spinal manipulative therapy was not associated with changes in lymphocyte levels or physiological markers among patients with low back pain or participants who were asymptomatic compared with sham manipulation, a lecture series, and venipuncture control groups. Spinal manipulative therapy was associated with short-term changes in selected immunological biomarkers among asymptomatic participants compared with sham manipulation, a lecture series, and venipuncture control groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this systematic review of 13 studies, no clinical evidence was found to support or refute claims that SMT was efficacious or effective in changing immune system outcomes. Although there were limited preliminary data from basic scientific studies suggesting that SMT may be associated with short-term changes in immunological and endocrine biomarkers, the clinical relevance of these findings is unknown. Given the lack of evidence that SMT is associated with the prevention of infectious diseases or improvements in immune function, further studies should be completed before claims of efficacy or effectiveness are made.","Chow, Ngai; Hogg-Johnson, Sheilah; Mior, Silvano; Cancelliere, Carol; Injeyan, Stephen; Teodorczyk-Injeyan, Julita; Cassidy, J.

This study investigated the impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) on the risk for respiratory failure and mortality in COVID-19 patients. A nationwide retrospective cohort study was conducted in 4610 patients (≥ 40 years old) infected with COVID-19 between January 20 and May 27, 2020, using data from the Ministry of Health and Welfare and Health Insurance Review and Assessment Service in Korea. The clinical course and various clinical features were compared between COPD and non-COPD patients, and the risks of respiratory failure and all-cause mortality in COPD patients were analyzed using a multivariate logistic regression model. Among 4610 COVID-19 patients, 4469 (96.9%) and 141 (3.1%) were categorized into the non-COPD and COPD groups, respectively. The COPD group had greater proportions of older (≥ 60 years old) (78.0% vs. 45.2%, P < 0.001) and male (52.5% vs. 36.6%, P < 0.001) patients than the non-COPD group. Relatively greater proportions of patients with COPD received intensive critical care (7.1% vs. 3.7%, P = 0.041) and mechanical ventilation (5.7% vs. 2.4%, P = 0.015). Multivariate analyses showed that COPD was not a risk factor for respiratory failure but was a significant independent risk factor for all-cause mortality (OR = 1.80, 95% CI 1.11–2.93) after adjustment for age, sex, and Charlson Comorbidity Index score. Among COVID-19 patients, relatively greater proportions of patients with COPD received mechanical ventilation and intensive critical care.

Empirical data show that the characteristics of the effects of the virus do vary between the two periods. Differences in age range and severity of the disease have been reported, although the comparative characteristics of the two waves still remain largely unknown. Those characteristics are compared in this study using data from two equal periods of 3 and a half months. The first period, between 15(th) March and 30(th) June, corresponding to the entire first wave, and the second, between 1(st) July and 15(th) October, corresponding to part of the second wave, still present at the time of writing this article. Two hundred and four patients were hospitalized during the first period, and 264 during the second period. Patients in the second wave were younger and the duration of hospitalization and case fatality rate were lower than those in the first wave. In the second wave, there were more children, and pregnant and post-partum women. The most frequent signs and symptoms in both waves were fever, dyspnea, pneumonia, and cough, and the most relevant comorbidities were cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic neurological diseases. Patients from the second wave more frequently presented renal and gastrointestinal symptoms, were more often treated with non-invasive mechanical ventilation and corticoids, and less often with invasive mechanical ventilation, conventional oxygen therapy and anticoagulants. Several differences in mortality risk factors were also observed. These results might help to understand the characteristics of the second wave and the behaviour and danger of SARS-CoV-2 in the Mediterranean area and in Western Europe.

The current classification of coronaviruses recognizes 39 species in 27 subgenera that belong to the family Coronaviridae. From those, at least seven coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections in humans. Four of these viruses can cause common cold-like symptoms. Those that infect animals can evolve and become infectious to humans. Three recent examples of these viral jumps include SARS CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS CoV-2 virus. They are responsible for causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the most recently discovered coronavirus disease during 2019 (COVID-19). COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. The rapid spread of the disease has taken the scientific and medical community by surprise. Latest figures from 20th May 2020 show more than 5 million people had been infected with the virus, causing more than 330,000 deaths in over 210 countries worldwide.

The negative short-term impact on neonatal care in relation to the prevention of proximity, contact and bonding between parents and babies is potentially significant. However, an interesting finding has been reported of a reduction in premature birth admissions to the neonatal intensive care unit during the pandemic, raising important questions. Why was this?

Investigation of pattern in the occurrence of COVID-19, to check the influence of different meteorological factors on the incidence of COVID-19 and prediction of incidence of COVID-19 are the objectives of this paper. METHODS: For trend analysis, Sen's Slope and Man-Kendall test have been used, Generalized Additive Model (GAM) of regression has been used to check the influence of different meteorological factors on the incidence and to predict the frequency of COVID-19, and Verhulst (Logistic) Population Model has been used. RESULTS: Statistically significant linear trend found for the daily-confirmed cases of COVID-19. The regression analysis indicates that there is some influence of the interaction of average temperature (AT) and average relative humidity (ARH) on the incidence of COVID-19. However, this result is not consistent throughout the study area. The projections have been made up to 21st May, 2020.

We aimed to describe the impact of the initial wave of the pandemic on admissions, care quality, and outcomes in patients with acute stroke in the United Kingdom. METHODS: Registry-based cohort study of patients with acute stroke admitted to hospital in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland between October 1, 2019, and April 30, 2020, and equivalent periods in the 3 prior years. RESULTS: One hundred fourteen hospitals provided data for a study cohort of 184 017 patients. During the lockdown period (March 23 to April 30), there was a 12% reduction (6923 versus 7902) in the number of admissions compared with the same period in the 3 previous years. Admissions fell more for ischemic than hemorrhagic stroke, for older patients, and for patients with less severe strokes. Quality of care was preserved for all measures and in some domains improved during lockdown (direct access to stroke unit care, 1-hour brain imaging, and swallow screening). Although there was no change in the proportion of patients discharged with good outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, ≤2; 48% versus 48%), 7-day inpatient case fatality increased from 6.9% to 9.4% (P<0.001) and was 22.0% in patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 (adjusted rate ratio, 1.41 [1.11–1.80]). CONCLUSIONS: Assuming that the true incidence of acute stroke did not change markedly during the pandemic, hospital avoidance may have created a cohort of untreated stroke patients at risk of poorer outcomes or recurrent events. Unanticipated improvements in stroke care quality should be used as an opportunity for quality improvement and to learn about how to develop resilient health care systems.","Douiri, Abdel; Muruet, Walter; Bhalla, Ajay; James, Martin; Paley, Lizz; Stanley, Kaili; Rudd, Anthony G.; Wolfe, Charles D.A.; Bray, Benjamin D.",Stroke,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33896223/; https://doi.org/10.1161/strokeaha.120.032253,424

However, its effects are still not well understood. The aim of this study is to assess the effects of danhong injection in the management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: Electronic databases such as PubMed, MEDLINE, EMbase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WanFang, the Chongqing VIP Chinese Science and Technology Periodical Database, and China biomedical literature database will be searched without limitations of language and geographical location. Two researchers will independently conduct research selection, data extraction, and research quality assessment. The RevMan 5.3 software and Stata 14.0 software are used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: This study will provide high-quality comprehensive evidence for the effectiveness and safety of danhong injection in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained from this study will define the basis for the effectiveness and safety of danhong injection in the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.","Lan, Yanqiu; Wu, Dezhi; Jin, Yunrui; Shui, Min; Fan, Xianjun",Medicine (Baltimore),https://doi.org/10.1097/md.0000000000022016; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32925734/,424
689543,From Bedside to Webside: a neurological clinical teaching experience,2020-04-14,"When the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic was declared, it was clear that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) would have far‐reaching impacts on medicine, society and everyday life. As a junior doctor working closely with patients with SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, I was aware of my personal risk of exposure to the virus. I assumed that as a fit and well 26‐year‐old with no comorbidities, if I were to become infected, it was unlikely that COVID‐19 would be severe. However, I became critically unwell following a week of clinical work, necessitating hospital admission, tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. I remained mechanically ventilated for 6 days and was then transferred to a medical ward 2 days later. After two further days of rehabilitation, I was discharged home. This reflection is not a junior doctor’s view of how COVID‐19 was managed by the NHS, but a personal view of my illness from ‘the other side of the curtain’. My reflections focus upon the psychological aspects of my experiences, exploring the memories that I formed around the time of critical care, how the fears that I possessed were managed with exceptional communication, and the importance of the wider healthcare team in my recovery.","Ramachandran, S.",Anaesth Rep,https://doi.org/10.1002/anr3.12052; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32537614/,424
