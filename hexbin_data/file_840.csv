60215,Total laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy.,2013,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused significant morbidity and mortality for patients and stressed healthcare systems worldwide. The clinical features and outcomes of COVID-19 among immunosuppressed patients, who are at presumed risk of more severe disease but who may also have decreased detrimental inflammatory responses, are not well characterized. We review the existing literature on COVID-19 among immunocompromised populations ranging from patients with cancer and solid-organ transplant recipients to patients with HIV and those receiving immunomodulatory therapy for autoimmune disease. Patients with malignancy and solid-organ transplant recipients may be at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease and death, whereas for those with other types of immunocompromise, current evidence is less clear. Overall, further prospective controlled studies are needed to determine the attributable risk of immunocompromising conditions and therapies on COVID-19 disease prognosis.","Fung, Monica; Babik, Jennifer M",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,https://doi.org/10.1093/cid/ciaa863; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33501974/,840

Methods: The epidemiology, clinical symptoms, atory and radiologic data of 150 patients with 2019-nCoV infection admitted to the designated hospitals in Nanyang City from January 24,2020 to February 16, 2020 were retrospectively analyzed. Results: The 150 patients with 2019 nCov infection consisted of 67 men and 83 women, and the median age was 45±16 years; 69 of them were the first generation case,60 of them were the second generation case, 6 of them were the third generation case,the median incubation period of the first generation case was 5.4±2.2 days, and the second generation case was 6.7±3.1 days, and the first-generation cases are the majority in severe patients (69%) . The most common basic disease was hypertension (13 cases, 9%), diabetes (9 cases, 6%), and the most common symptom is fever(142 cases, 95%, 63% showed moderate fever) , cough and sputum(108 cases,72%), fatigue(23 cases,15%), anorexia(20 cases, 13%), headache, diarrhea, muscle soreness, sore throat as the first symptoms. The average time from onset of symptoms to consultation was 4.2±2.2 days for all patients. The changes in peripheral blood cells were mainly lymphonpenia (83 cases, 55%) and eosinophilia (95 cases, 63%), The lymphocyte count of the severe and critically ill patients was more significantly reduced, and some patients had increased myocardial enzymes, mainly LDH (47 cases, 31%), and a few patients had liver function damage, mainly manifested in ALT and AST. High, very few patients have renal impairment. Among the inflammation-related indicators, the main manifestations are increased CRP (66 cases, 43%) and ESR (86 cases, 57%), elevated D-Dimer in 29% of patients. 144 cases have different degrees of infective lesions in chest CT examination, with 30 cases (21%) on one side and 144 cases (79%) on both sides. Morphologically, most of the lesions were patchy ground glass lesions, which could be accompanied by air bronchus signs and some consolidation and paving stone signs. Of the cases showing ""white lung"", 87% were sever ill or critically ill. After active treatment, 45% of patients were discharged according to discharge standards. 33% of sever and critically ill patients were discharged, 49% of them were degraded hospitalization.The average length of hospitalization was 12±4 days. Conclusion: A history of epidemiological exposure, fever, chest CT with signs of pneumonia, normal or decreased WBC, and lymphocytopenia, eosinophilia are the clinical basis for the diagnosis of this disease, and most of the sever patients were the first generation cases. The degree of lymphocytopenia is related to the severity of the disease.","Sun, C; Zhang, X B; Dai, Y; Xu, X Z; Zhao, J",Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases,https://doi.org/10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20200224-00168; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32295322/,840
61352,Outcome analysis of early laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy experience.,2013,"INTRODUCTION Serious bacterial infections (SBI) are major causes of mortality and morbidity in children. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of the immature granulocyte (IG) percentage in predicting SBI. METHODS Patients admitted to the pediatric emergency department with fever were divided into two groups: with SBI and with non-SBI. White blood cell (WBC) count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), C-reactive protein (CRP), and the percentage of IG value were recorded, and their accuracy in predicting SBI was evaluated. RESULTS Sixty-one (14.3%) patients fell into the SBI group and 367 (85.7%) were with non-SBI. Mean IG percentage among SBI patients was 0.84 ± 1.21 and 0.27 ± 0.20 for with non-SBI patients (P = .001). Based on disease, the highest IG percentage was found in patients diagnosed with sepsis (IG 3.7 ± 3.5%) and with bacterial meningitis (IG 1.6 ± 1.3%). The area under the curve (AUC) of IG percentage to predict SBI was 0.83 with 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.78-0.88]; WBC was 0.76 (95% CI 0.70-0.83); ANC was 0.73 (95% CI 0.67-0.80), and CRP was 0.79 (95% CI 0.73-0.85). When infection markers were compared to the most appropriate cut-off values in predicting SBI, IG percentage showed the highest sensitivity and specificity. When the cut-off value was determined as >0.35 for IG percentage, sensitivity was 75.4% and specificity was 76.6% in predicting SBI. CONCLUSION Patients with SBI had a higher IG percentage. Compared to other biomarkers, IG percentage had higher sensitivity and specificity in predicting SBI.","Güngör, Ali; Göktuğ, Aytaç; Tekeli, Aysun; Bodur, İlknur; Öztürk, Betül; Güneylioğlu, Muhammed Mustafa; Yaradılmış, Raziye Merve; Akca Çağlar, Ayla; Tuygun, Nilden; Karacan, Can Demir",International journal of laboratory hematology,https://doi.org/10.1111/ijlh.13474; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33527769/,840

Specifically, surgeons are often faced with the dilemma of determining whether such a swelling is a recurrent hernia or just a swelling only. MATERIALS AND METHODS A total of 1,065 laparoscopic TEP inguinal hernia repairs were performed on 944 patients by a single surgeon between December 2000 and December 2008, and we reviewed these data. RESULTS The overall incidence of swelling formation was 6.5% (70 of 1,065 cases). Swellings were more frequent in males, and in association with the following diagnoses: indirect inguinal hernias, larger hernia defects, scrotal hernias, omental incarcerations, and the presence of residual distal sacs. Fifty-eight (83%) of 70 patients who had swelling after laparoscopic TEP did not need any intervention for swelling and the swelling resolved spontaneously. CONCLUSIONS Although postoperative swellings are a common complication after laparoscopic TEP repairs of inguinal hernias, swellings are minor complications, are not associated with hernia recurrence, and generally subside spontaneously.","Choi, Yoon Young; Kim, Zisun; Hur, Kyung Yul",World journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00268-010-0843-3; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21042911/,840
61993,Tissue expanders: early experience of a novel treatment option for perineal herniation.,2013,"BACKGROUND The majority of prevalence studies on deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in severe COVID-19 patients are retrospective with DVT assessment based on clinical suspicion. Our aim was to prospectively and systematically estimate the occurrence of DVT in critically ill mechanically ventilated patients, and to identify potential risk factors for DVT occurrence and mortality. METHODS All patients with COVID-19 admitted to our 45-beds intensive care unit (ICU) between March 6, 2020 and April 18, 2020 requiring invasive ventilatory support were daily screened for DVT with lower extremities and jugular veins ultrasonography. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were performed in order to identify predictors of DVT and mortality. RESULTS Seventy-six patients were included in the final analysis (56 men, mean age 67 years, median SOFA 7 points, median SAPS II 41 points, median PaO2/Fi02 10.8 kPa). The period prevalence of DVT was 40.8%. Thirty-one DVTs were diagnosed. Twenty-five DVTs (80.6% of total DVTs) were catheter-related, mainly in the jugular veins. Twentysix DVTs (83.9%) occurred in patients receiving enhanced antithrombotic prophylaxis. No independent variable was predictive of DVT occurrence. Twenty-eight patients (36.8%) died during the ICU stay. Age and SOFA score were independently associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS A high number of critically ill mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients developed a DVT. The majority of DVTs were catheter-related and occurred under intensive prophylactic anticoagulation. Routine ultrasound of the jugular veins should be suggested in this patient population, and in particular in presence of a central venous catheter.","Chiesa, Alessandro F; Previsdomini, Marco; Valenti, Elisa; Stoira, Elisa; Stricker, Hans; Gerber, Bernhard; Demundo, Daniela; Clivio, Luca; Pagnamenta, Alberto",Minerva anestesiologica,https://doi.org/10.23736/s0375-9393.21.15510-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34633166/,840
62143,Laparoscopic transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP) groin hernia repair using n-butyl-2-cyanoacrylate (Liquiband®Fix8™) for mesh fixation and peritoneal closure: learning experience during introduction into clinical practice.,2019,"The confluence (sangam) of India's two major rivers, the Ganges and the Yamuna, is located in the city of Allahabad. Ritualistic dips in these river waters are revered for their believed curative power against infections, and salvation from the karmic cycles of birth and rebirth. The sacred and geographic propensities of the rivers have mythic valences in Hinduism and other religious traditions. Yet the connection of these river waters with curativeness also has a base in historical microbiology: near here, the British bacteriologist Ernest Hanbury Hankin, in 1896, first described the 'bactericidal action of the waters of the Jamuna and Ganges rivers on Cholera microbes', predating the discovery of bacterial viruses (now known as bacteriophages) by at least two decades. Pursuing the record of these purificatory waters in sacred writings and folklore, and later elaboration in the work of Hankin, this paper traces an epistemology of time that connects the mythic to the post-Hankin modern scientific, asking how imaginations of the waters' antibacterial properties are articulated through idioms of faith, filth and the phage. The paper explores how the bacteriophage virus comes to be spoken about within secular and sacred epistemes of infection and riverine pollution, among contemporary historians, biologists and doctors, and in the city's museums. At the same time, it traces the phage in histories arcing from the ancient religious literature, to colonial disease control efforts, to today, where bacteriophages are being conceived as a potential response to the crisis of planetary antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Allahabad presents a 'cosmotechnics' where faith, filth and phage are inextricably intertwined, generating complex triangulations between natural ecologies, cultural practices and scientific imaginations. Cosmotechnics therefore opens up novel avenues to reimagine the phage as a protean object, one that occupies partial and multiple spaces in the historico-mytho-scientific arena of Allahabad today.","Kochhar, Rijul",Notes and records of the Royal Society of London,https://doi.org/10.1098/rsnr.2020.0019; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33184518/,840
62723,Magnetic resonance visualization of iron-loaded meshes in patients with pain after inguinal hernia repair.,2020-03-12,"Persistent propagative viruses maintain intricate interactions with their arthropod vectors. In this study, we investigated the transcriptome-level responses associated with a persistent propagative phytovirus infection in various life stages of its vector using an Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform. The pathosystem components included a Tospovirus, Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), its insect vector, Frankliniella fusca (Hinds), and a plant host, Arachis hypogaea (L.). We assembled (de novo) reads from three developmental stage groups of virus-exposed and non-virus-exposed F. fusca into one transcriptome consisting of 72 366 contigs and identified 1161 differentially expressed (DE) contigs. The number of DE contigs was greatest in adults (female) (562) when compared with larvae (first and second instars) (395) and pupae (pre- and pupae) (204). Upregulated contigs in virus-exposed thrips had blastx annotations associated with intracellular transport and virus replication. Upregulated contigs were also assigned blastx annotations associated with immune responses, including apoptosis and phagocytosis. In virus-exposed larvae, Blast2GO analysis identified functional groups, such as multicellular development with downregulated contigs, while reproduction, embryo development and growth were identified with upregulated contigs in virus-exposed adults. This study provides insights into differences in transcriptome-level responses modulated by TSWV in various life stages of an important vector, F. fusca.","Shrestha, Anita; Champagne, Donald E; Culbreath, Albert K; Rotenberg, Dorith; Whitfield, Anna E; Srinivasan, Rajagopalbabu",The Journal of general virology,https://doi.org/10.1099/jgv.0.000874; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28741996/,840
63663,Laparoscopic ileocolic iterative resection with fluorescence-guided lymphatic mapping - a video vignette.,2017,"The coronavirus assembly process encloses a ribonucleoprotein genome into vesicles containing the lipid-embedded proteins S (spike), E (envelope), and M (membrane). This process depends on interactions with membranes that may involve palmitoylation, a common posttranslational lipidation of cysteine residues. To determine whether specific palmitoylations influence coronavirus assembly, we introduced plasmid DNAs encoding mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) S, E, M, and N (nucleocapsid) into 293T cells and found that virus-like particles (VLPs) were robustly assembled and secreted into culture medium. Palmitate adducts predicted on cysteines 40, 44, and 47 of the 83-residue E protein were then evaluated by constructing mutant cDNAs with alanine or glycine codon substitutions at one or more of these positions. Triple-substituted proteins (E.Ts) lacked palmitate adducts. Both native E and E.T proteins localized at identical perinuclear locations, and both copurified with M proteins, but E.T was entirely incompetent for VLP production. In the presence of the E.T proteins, the M protein subunits accumulated into detergent-insoluble complexes that failed to secrete from cells, while native E proteins mobilized M into detergent-soluble secreted forms. Many of these observations were corroborated in the context of natural MHV infections, with native E, but not E.T, complementing debilitated recombinant MHVs lacking E. Our findings suggest that palmitoylations are essential for E to act as a vesicle morphogenetic protein and further argue that palmitoylated E proteins operate by allowing the primary coronavirus assembly subunits to assume configurations that can mobilize into secreted lipid vesicles and virions.","Boscarino, Joseph A; Logan, Hillary L; Lacny, Jason J; Gallagher, Thomas M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01906-07; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18184706/,840

However, data from European centres are scarce. OBJECTIVES We aimed to characterise the gastrointestinal manifestations of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and their disease course. METHODS Patients admitted at our centre between March and April 2020 with diagnosis of COVID-19 were included. Asymptomatic patients or those without symptom information were excluded. Clinical features, laboratory data and disease severity (mechanical ventilation, intensive care admission or death) were analysed. RESULTS Two-hundred one patients were included (median age 71 years; 56.2% male). Digestive symptoms were reported by 60 (29.9%) patients during the disease course, being part of the disease presentation in 34 (16.9%). The most frequent were diarrhoea in 36 patients (17.9%). Patients with gastrointestinal symptoms were younger (P = 0.032), had higher haemoglobin levels (P = 0.002) and lower C-reactive protein (P = 0.045) and potassium levels (P = 0.004). Patients with digestive symptoms had less severe disease (28.3 vs. 44.0%; P = 0.038). Regarding liver damage, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was elevated in 65.2% of patients and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in 62.7%, but these patients did not present a more severe disease (elevated AST P = 0.062; elevated ALT P = 0.276). CONCLUSION A significant portion of COVID-19 patients have digestive symptoms, mostly at presentation. This should be taken into account in order to keep a high level of suspicion to reach an early diagnosis and setup infection control measures to control the transmission rate.

But only a few cases of patients receiving this have been reported in the literature. Here we report the largest registry of the use of rpFVIII for the treatment of AHA. The objective of this retrospective study was to describe the efficacy and the safety of susoctocog-alfa for AHA. MATERIAL AND METHODS We studied a population of nine patients, recruited in five Italian haemophilia centres presenting AHA, and treated with Obizur® as first- or second-line therapy. fir RESULTS: rpFVIII was used as a first-line therapy in one-third of the patients. The median delay between clinical onset and diagnosis was 16 days. Initial bolus of infused susoctocog-alfa was 100 IU/kg, lower than the recommended dose. The treatment was maintained for a median of four days. Only one patient with serious co-morbidities and recurrent infections was treated for 32 days. All patients reached a complete resolution of AHA, and no recurrences were reported. Two patients developed a low-titre inhibitor against rpFVIII, neither experienced any complications.

A credible way of managing the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular diseases is by reducing risk factors. This understanding has led to the development and recommendation for the clinical use of cardiovascular risk stratification tools. These tools enhance clinical decision-making. However, there is a lag in the implementation of these tools in most countries. This systematic review seeks to synthesise the current knowledge of the factors influencing the implementation of cardiovascular risk scoring in primary care settings. METHODS We searched bibliographic databases and grey literature for studies of any design relating to the topic. Titles, abstracts and full texts were independently assessed for eligibility by two reviewers. This was followed by quality assessment and data extraction. We analysed data using an integrated and best fit framework synthesis approach to identify these factors. Quantitative and qualitative forms of data were combined into a single mixed-methods synthesis. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research was used as the guiding tool and template for this analysis. RESULTS Twenty-five studies (cross-sectional n = 12, qualitative n = 9 and mixed-methods n = 4) were included in this review. Twenty (80%) of these were conducted in high-income countries. Only four studies (16%) included patients as participants. This review reports on a total of eleven cardiovascular risk stratification tools. The factors influencing the implementation of cardiovascular risk scoring are related to clinical setting and healthcare system (resources, priorities, practice culture and organisation), users (attributes and interactions between users) and the specific cardiovascular risk tool (characteristics, perceived role and effectiveness). CONCLUSIONS While these findings bolster the understanding of implementation complexity, there exists limited research in the context of low and middle-income countries. Notwithstanding the need to direct resources in bridging this gap, it is also crucial that these efforts are in concert with providing high-quality evidence on the clinical effectiveness of using cardiovascular risk scoring to improve cardiovascular disease outcomes of mortality and morbidity.

The disease condition associated with novel coronavirus, referred to as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The emergence of novel coronavirus in 2019 in Wuhan, China marked the third highly pathogenic coronavirus infecting humans in the 21st century. The continuing emergence of coronaviruses at regular intervals poses a significant threat to human health and economy. Ironically, even after a decade of research on coronavirus, still there are no licensed vaccines or therapeutic agents to treat coronavirus infection which highlights an urgent need to develop effective vaccines or post-exposure prophylaxis to prevent future epidemics. Several clinical, genetic and epidemiological features of COVID-19 resemble SARS-CoV infection. Hence, the research advancements on SARS-CoV treatment might help scientific community in quick understanding of this virus pathogenesis and develop effective therapeutic/prophylactic agents to treat and prevent this infection. Monoclonal antibodies represent the major class of biotherapeutics for passive immunotherapy to fight against viral infection. The therapeutic potential of monoclonal antibodies has been well recognized in the treatment of many diseases. Here, we summarize the potential monoclonal antibody based therapeutic intervention for COVID-19 by considering the existing knowledge on the neutralizing monoclonal antibodies against similar coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Further research on COVID-19 pathogenesis could identify appropriate therapeutic targets to develop specific anti-virals against this newly emerging pathogen.","Shanmugaraj, Balamurugan; Siriwattananon, Konlavat; Wangkanont, Kittikhun; Phoolcharoen, Waranyoo",Asian Pacific journal of allergy and immunology,https://doi.org/10.12932/ap-200220-0773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32134278/,840

Learning management system (LMS) data from online classes may provide opportunities to identify students at risk of failure. Previous LMS studies have not addressed the possibility of change in student engagement over time. The purpose of this study was to apply a novel statistical technique, group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM), to LMS data for an online course to identify predictors of successful course completion.Methods. Exploratory GBTM assessed the association of LMS activity (total activity time, dates of activity, and pages viewed) and attendance at virtual synchronous learning sessions with examination performance in a capstone disease-management course delivered in the final didactic quarter of a three-year Doctor of Pharmacy program. Groups were assigned based on trajectories of weekly page-view counts using structural-equation modeling.Results. GBTM identified three page-view engagement groups (median total page views, n): Group 1, high (1,818, n=24): Group 2, moderate (1,029, n=74), and Group 3, low (441 views, n=35). Group assignment alone was somewhat associated with final grade. Stratification based on consistent virtual synchronous learning session attendance improved predictive accuracy; for example, a top (A or A-) grade was earned by 49.0% and 24.0%, respectively, of Group 2 students with and without consistent synchronous engagement.Conclusion. Application of GBTM to LMS data, including information about synchronous engagement, could provide early warning signs of potential for course failure, helping instructors to target interventions to at-risk students. The technique should be further tested with alternative LMS data and early in didactics, before patterns of engagement are established.","Buckley, Kelsey; Fairman, Kathleen; Pogge, Elizabeth; Raney, Erin",American journal of pharmaceutical education,https://doi.org/10.5688/ajpe8594; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34385169/,840
72686,Total or partial removal of infected mesh? Invited comment.,2018,"In recent years interest has grown in the occurrence and the effects of pharmaceuticals in the environment. The aim of this work is to evaluate the risk of fertilizing crops with manure from livestock treated with anthelmintics. The present study was designed to follow the fate of the commonly used anthelmintic drug, ivermectin (IVM) and its metabolites in soybeans (Glycine max (L.) Merr.), a plant that is grown and consumed world-wide for its high content of nutritional and health-beneficial substances. In vitro plantlets and soybean plants, cultivated in a greenhouse, were used for this purpose. Our results showed the uptake of IVM and its translocation to the leaves, but not in the pods and the beans. Four IVM metabolites were detected in the roots, and one in the leaves. IVM exposure decreased slightly the number and weight of the beans and induced changes in the activities of antioxidant enzymes. In addition, the presence of IVM affected the proportion of individual isoflavones and reduced the content of isoflavones aglycones, which might decrease the therapeutic value of soybeans. Fertilization of soybean fields with manure from IVM-treated animals appears to be safe for humans, due to the absence of IVM in beans, the food part of plants. On the other hand, it could negatively affect soybean plants and herbivorous invertebrates.","Navrátilová, Martina; Raisová Stuchlíková, Lucie; Moťková, Kateřina; Szotáková, Barbora; Skálová, Lenka; Langhansová, Lenka; Podlipná, Radka",Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules25163655; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32796616/,840

The latest studies found that advanced age, immune function defects, inflammatory factor storms and oxidative stress damage all potentially contribute to the high comorbidity of the two. Direct virus invasion, myocardial oxygen supply and demand imbalance and vascular endothelial and coagulation dysfunction may be important mechanisms for cardiovascular injury in COVID-19 patients. In addition, the expression level of ACE2 (the cell membrane receptor of SARS-CoV-2) in various organs and the peripheral blood not only mediates the direct invasion and damage of the organs, but also participates in regulation of the balance of systematic inflammation and oxidative stress, thus affecting the susceptibility and outcomes of the patients. Herein we review the recent research progress in the comorbidity between COVID-19 and CVMD and explore the mechanisms of cardiovascular damage caused by SARS-CoV-2, thus to provide a theoretical basis for the clinical diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 with underlying CVMD.","Han, T; Yuan, H; Ye, L; Jiang, X; Bai, L; Wang, C",Nan fang yi ke da xue xue bao = Journal of Southern Medical University,https://doi.org/10.12122/j.issn.1673-4254.2021.04.22; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33963726/,840

Previous editions of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual relied on the anatomic TNM method of staging that incorporates imaging and employs population-level survival data to predict patient outcomes. Recent advances in therapy based on biomarker status and multigene panels have advanced treatment strategies. In the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual's newest edition (8th edition, adopted on January 1, 2018), breast cancer staging integrates anatomic staging with tumor grade, biomarker data of hormone receptor status, oncogene expression, and gene expression profiling, to assign prognostic stage. This article reviews the AJCC 8th edition breast cancer staging system with a focus on anatomic staging and the challenges that anatomic staging poses for radiologists. We highlight key imaging findings that impact patient management and discuss the role of imaging in evaluating response to neoadjuvant therapy. Finally, we discuss biomarkers and multigene panels and how these impact prognostic stage. The review will help radiologists identify critical findings that affect breast cancer staging as well as understand ongoing limitations of imaging in staging.","Teichgraeber, Davis C; Guirguis, Mary S; Whitman, Gary J",AJR.

Studies of physicians, including medical students, residents, and fellows, have shown that they also experience mental disorders, with some research (e.g., on depression) showing prevalence rates higher than those in the general population. Tragically, physicians also have higher suicide rates than the general population. In this Invited Commentary, the author discusses his own challenges with mental disorders beginning in early childhood. He shares how earlier trauma led to the emergence of symptoms that nearly caused him to withdraw from medical school during his first year, and he describes how support from a faculty member helped him receive psychiatric treatment that allowed him to successfully negotiate that serious crisis and experience a long, productive career. The author underscores how the idealized image of the physician as care giver rather than care receiver that many bring to their medical career, as well as the stigma associated with mental disorders, may prevent physicians from seeking care. He uses the narrative of his personal journey to make a plea to colleagues to share their own stories of mental illness and successful treatment, arguing that this is key to ultimately destigmatizing these issues for the profession of medicine.","Kirch, Darrell G",Academic medicine : journal of the Association of American Medical Colleges,https://doi.org/10.1097/acm.0000000000003942; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33496431/,840

79004,Early Diagnosis of Colonic Anastomotic Leak With Peritoneal Endoscopy.,2015,"Respiratory syncytial virus is a common cause of bronchiolitis. Historically, point-of-care tests have involved antigen detection technology with limited sensitivity. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the diagnostic accuracy and model the economic impact of the Roche cobas® Liat® point-of-care influenza A/B and respiratory syncytial virus test. The ""DEC-RSV"" study was a multi-centre, prospective, observational study in children under 2 years presenting with viral respiratory symptoms. A nasopharyngeal aspirate sample was tested using the point-of-care test and standard laboratory-based procedures. The primary outcome was accuracy of respiratory syncytial virus detection. The cost implications of adopting a point-of-care test were modelled using study data. A total of 186 participants were recruited, with both tests performed on 177 samples. The point-of-care test was invalid for 16 samples (diagnostic yield 91%) leaving 161 available for primary analysis. After resolving discrepancies, the cobas® Liat® respiratory syncytial virus test had 100.00% (95% CI 96.07%-100.00%) sensitivity and 98.53% (95% CI 92.08%-99.96%) specificity. Median time to result was 0.6 h (interquartile range (IQR) 0.5-1) for point-of-care testing and 28.9 h (IQR 26.3-48.1) for standard laboratory testing. Estimated non-diagnostic cost savings for 1000 patients, based on isolation decision-making on point-of-care test result, were £57 010, which would increase to £94 847 when cohort nursing is used. In young children the cobas® Liat® point-of-care respiratory syncytial virus test has high diagnostic accuracy using nasopharyngeal aspirates (currently an off-licence sample type). Time to result is clinically important and was favourable compared to laboratory-based testing. The potential exists for cost savings when adopting the point-of-care test.","Allen, A Joy; Gonzalez-Ciscar, Andrea; Lendrem, Clare; Suklan, Jana; Allen, Karen; Bell, Ashley; Baxter, Frances; Crulley, Stephen; Fairlie, Louise; Hardy, Danielle; Johnston, Louise; McKenna, Joanne; Richards, Nicole; Shovlin, Gavin; Simmister, Clare; Waugh, Sheila; Woodsford, Philip; Graziadio, Sara; Power, Michael; Simpson, A John; Kumar, Prashant; Eastham, Katherine; Brodlie, Malcolm",ERJ open research,https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00018-2020; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32832529/,840

80381,Methodical endoscopic repair of congenital indirect inguinoscrotal hernia in adult male patients with completely patent processus vaginalis.,2017,"BACKGROUND Oral rehydration solution (ORS) is a form of oral rehydration therapy (ORT) for diarrhoea that has the potential to drastically reduce child mortality; yet, according to UNICEF estimates, less than half of children younger than 5 years with diarrhoea in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs) received ORS in 2016. A variety of recommended home fluids (RHF) exist as alternative forms of ORT; however, it is unclear whether RHF prevent child mortality. Previous studies have shown considerable variation between countries in ORS and RHF use, but subnational variation is unknown. This study aims to produce high-resolution geospatial estimates of relative and absolute coverage of ORS, RHF, and ORT (use of either ORS or RHF) in LMICs. METHODS We used a Bayesian geostatistical model including 15 spatial covariates and data from 385 household surveys across 94 LMICs to estimate annual proportions of children younger than 5 years of age with diarrhoea who received ORS or RHF (or both) on continuous continent-wide surfaces in 2000-17, and aggregated results to policy-relevant administrative units. Additionally, we analysed geographical inequality in coverage across administrative units and estimated the number of diarrhoeal deaths averted by increased coverage over the study period. Uncertainty in the mean coverage estimates was calculated by taking 250 draws from the posterior joint distribution of the model and creating uncertainty intervals (UIs) with the 2·5th and 97·5th percentiles of those 250 draws. FINDINGS While ORS use among children with diarrhoea increased in some countries from 2000 to 2017, coverage remained below 50% in the majority (62·6%; 12 417 of 19 823) of second administrative-level units and an estimated 6 519 000 children (95% UI 5 254 000-7 733 000) with diarrhoea were not treated with any form of ORT in 2017. Increases in ORS use corresponded with declines in RHF in many locations, resulting in relatively constant overall ORT coverage from 2000 to 2017. Although ORS was uniformly distributed subnationally in some countries, within-country geographical inequalities persisted in others; 11 countries had at least a 50% difference in one of their units compared with the country mean. Increases in ORS use over time were correlated with declines in RHF use and in diarrhoeal mortality in many locations, and an estimated 52 230 diarrhoeal deaths (36 910-68 860) were averted by scaling up of ORS coverage between 2000 and 2017. Finally, we identified key subnational areas in Colombia, Nigeria, and Sudan as examples of where diarrhoeal mortality remains higher than average, while ORS coverage remains lower than average. INTERPRETATION To our knowledge, this study is the first to produce and map subnational estimates of ORS, RHF, and ORT coverage and attributable child diarrhoeal deaths across LMICs from 2000 to 2017, allowing for tracking progress over time. Our novel results, combined with detailed subnational estimates of diarrhoeal morbidity and mortality, can support subnational needs assessments aimed at furthering policy makers' understanding of within-country disparities. Over 50 years after the discovery that led to this simple, cheap, and life-saving therapy, large gains in reducing mortality could still be made by reducing geographical inequalities in ORS coverage.

82001,Transumbilical single incision laparoscopic sigmoidectomy for benign disease.,2010,"BACKGROUND Although bariatric procedures are considered safe, yet still they involve a risk of possible perioperative complications. Identification of risk factors for complications would allow for appropriate preoperative optimization of the patient, as well as reasonable postoperative care and early diagnosis and treatment of possible complications. The aim of this study was to determine the risk factors for perioperative complications after laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB). MATERIAL AND METHODS A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of patients operated for morbid obesity. Regarding postoperative complications defined as adverse events occurring within 30 days of the procedure. Factors associated with patient characteristics and those related to the surgical procedure were determined. 408 patients met inclusion criteria and were submitted to surgical treatment. LSG and LRYGB were performed in 233 and 175 patients, respectively. RESULTS Complications were observed in 30 (7.3%) patients. The maximum preoperative body weight and BMI, as well as body weight and BMI on the day of surgery were associated with increased complication rate. The type of the procedure did not influence perioperative complications (LRYGB vs. LSG; OR: 1.14; CI: 0.53-2.44; p = 0.74). Although operative time statistically significantly increased the risk of complications, it did not seem clinically relevant (OR: 1.01; CI: 1.00-1.02; p = 0.003). An increase in the number of stapler firings used significantly increased complication rate only in LSG group. CONCLUSION Longer duration of LSG and the increase in the number of stapler firings used during LSG should alert a surgeon to an increased risk of postoperative complications. In patients submitted to LRYGB the risk of possible complications increases with BMI.","Major, Piotr; Wysocki, Michał; Pędziwiatr, Michał; Pisarska, Magdalena; Dworak, Jadwiga; Małczak, Piotr; Budzyński, Andrzej",International journal of surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsu.2016.12.012; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27956112/,840

Here, we report dual growth factor-loaded hyaluronate collagen dressing (Dual-HCD) matrix, using different ratios of the concentration of stabilized growth factors-stabilized-EGF (S-EGF) and stabilized-bFGF (S-bFGF). At first, the optimal concentration ratio of S-EGF to S-bFGF in the Dual-HCD matrix is determined to be 1:2 in type I diabetic mice. This Dual-HCD matrix does not cause cytotoxicity and can be used in vivo. The wound-healing effect of this matrix is confirmed in type II diabetic mice. Dual HCD enhances angiogenesis which promotes wound healing and thus, it shows a significantly greater synergistic effect than the HCD matrix loaded with a single growth factor. Overall, we conclude that the Dual-HCD matrix represents an effective therapeutic agent for impaired diabetic wound healing.","Kim, Jihyun; Lee, Kyoung-Mi; Han, Seung Hwan; Ko, Eun Ae; Yoon, Dong Suk; Park, Ik Kyu; Shin, Hang-Cheol; Park, Kwang Hwan; Lee, Jin Woo",Journal of tissue engineering,https://doi.org/10.1177/2041731421999750; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33796249/,840

83035,Classification of prosthetics used in hernia repair based on weight and biomaterial.,2012,"The type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP) TMPRSS2 cleaves and activates the influenza virus and coronavirus surface proteins. Expression of TMPRSS2 is essential for the spread and pathogenesis of H1N1 influenza viruses in mice. In contrast, H3N2 viruses are less dependent on TMPRSS2 for viral amplification, suggesting that these viruses might employ other TTSPs for their activation. Here, we analyzed TTSPs, reported to be expressed in the respiratory system, for the ability to activate influenza viruses and coronaviruses. We found that MSPL and, to a lesser degree, DESC1 are expressed in human lung tissue and cleave and activate the spike proteins of the Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses for cell-cell and virus-cell fusion. In addition, we show that these proteases support the spread of all influenza virus subtypes previously pandemic in humans. In sum, we identified two host cell proteases that could promote the amplification of influenza viruses and emerging coronaviruses in humans and might constitute targets for antiviral intervention. Importance: Activation of influenza viruses by host cell proteases is essential for viral infectivity and the enzymes responsible are potential targets for antiviral intervention. The present study demonstrates that two cellular serine proteases, DESC1 and MSPL, activate influenza viruses and emerging coronaviruses in cell culture and, because of their expression in human lung tissue, might promote viral spread in the infected host. Antiviral strategies aiming to prevent viral activation might thus need to encompass inhibitors targeting MSPL and DESC1.","Zmora, Pawel; Blazejewska, Paulina; Moldenhauer, Anna-Sophie; Welsch, Kathrin; Nehlmeier, Inga; Wu, Qingyu; Schneider, Heike; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Bertram, Stephanie",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01427-14; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25122802/,840

Here, we revisit its significance using high-resolution colonic manometry. METHODS Manometry, using an 84-channel water-perfused catheter, was performed in 18 healthy volunteers. RESULTS The rectosigmoid junction registers as an intermittent pressure band of 26.2 ± 7.2 mmHg, or intermittent phasic transient pressure increases at a dominant frequency of 3 cpm and an amplitude of 28.6 ± 8.6 mmHg; or a combination of tone and transient pressures, at a single sensor, 10-17 cm above the anal verge. Features are its relaxation or contraction in concert with relaxation or contraction of the anal sphincters when a motor pattern such as a high-amplitude propagating pressure wave or a simultaneous pressure wave comes down, indicating that such pressure increases or decreases at the rectosigmoid junction are part of neurally driven programs. We show that the junction is a site where motor patterns end, or where they start; e.g. retrogradely propagating cyclic motor patterns emerge from the junction. CONCLUSIONS The rectosigmoid junction is a functional sphincter that should be referred to as the sphincter of O'Beirne; it is part of the ""braking mechanism,"" contributing to continence by keeping content away from the rectum. In an accompanying case report, we show that its excessive presence in a patient with severe constipation can be a primary pathophysiology.","Chen, Ji-Hong; Nirmalathasan, Sharjana; Pervez, Maham; Milkova, Natalija; Huizinga, Jan D",Digestive diseases and sciences,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10620-020-06657-w; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33462748/,840

Implementation within emergency departments (EDs) has lagged. We sought to address barriers to improve documented capnography use for patients requiring intubation or CPR. METHODS A controlled before- and after-implementation study was performed in 2 urban EDs. The control site had an existing policy for capnography use. Interventions for the experimental site included a 5-minute informational video, placement of capnography monitors with a shortened warm-up period in all resuscitation rooms, laminated reminder cards, and feedback during staff meetings. Staff members were surveyed about knowledge before and after the intervention. Records were reviewed for documented capnography use for 3 months before and 6 months after the intervention. Change in documented use at the experimental site was compared with the control site. RESULTS At the experimental site, 118 providers participated and 190 records were reviewed; 544 records were reviewed from the control site. There was a significant increase in the proportion of documented capnography use at the experimental site (8% versus 19%, P = 0.04) compared with the control site (64% versus 71%, P = 0.10). However, there was no significant trend over time at the experimental site after the intervention (P = 0.86). Despite high baseline knowledge about capnography, providers had improvements in survey responses regarding indications for intubation and CPR, normal values, and minimum effective values during CPR. CONCLUSIONS Documented capnography use increased with simple interventions but with no positive trend.

We evaluated differences and influential factors related to the interference phenomenon according to these two microcatheters group. MATERIALS AND METHODS Between June 2011 and September 2013, the jailing technique was applied to 94 internal cerebral artery (ICA) aneurysms. The jailing technique with the Neuroform EZ stent system was performed using Renegade (n = 22), Rebar (n = 35), and XT-27 microcatheters (n = 37). In the Renegade Hi-Flo microcatheter group, the jailing technique was successful in 19/22 patients (86.4%) and interference between the two microcatheters occurred in 6/21 patients (28.6%). In the Rebar and XT-27 microcatheter group, the jailing technique was successful in 71/72 patients (98.6%) and interference between the two microcatheters occurred in 1/72 patients (1.4%). RESULTS There was a significant difference in the interference between the two delivered microcatheters group (p-value < 0.000) and the carotid siphon angle (p-value: 0.004) in the univariate analysis. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, the Rebar and XT-27 microcatheter group (odds ratio [OD] [95% confidence interval (CI)]; 31.277 [3.138-311.729], p-value: 0.003) and the carotid siphon angle (OD [95%CI]; 0.959 [0.922-0.997], p-value: 0.035) were found to be influential factors in the interference phenomenon. CONCLUSION The Rebar 27 and XT-27 microcatheters were more successful and exhibited less interference between the two microcatheters than the Renegade Hi-Flo microcatheter.","Yoo, Minwook; Jin, Sung-Chul; Kim, Seung-Hwan; Choi, Byeong-Sam; Kim, Hae Yu; Lee, SungJun; Kim, Sung Tae; Jeong, Hae Woong",Journal of cerebrovascular and endovascular neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.7461/jcen.2016.18.4.363; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28184346/,840
89749,Single-incision laparoscopic colonic surgery.,2011,"In Brazil, one of the countries most heavily affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, mortality data fail to reflect the real number of deaths from the disease. The study aimed to estimate excess deaths from respiratory causes and their trends during the first six month of the COVID-19 epidemic in adults 20 years or older in eight regional metropolises in Brazil. In this ecological study, deaths from respiratory causes (influenza, pneumonias, bronchitis, other chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, acute or chronic respiratory failure, respiratory failure or respiratory disorder not otherwise specified, and other deaths coded with respiratory symptoms) were extracted from the Mortality Information System. Expected deaths were estimated with quasi-Poisson generalized additive models. From February 23 to August 8, 2020, 46,028 deaths from respiratory causes were recorded in the eight cities, with an excess of 312% (95%CI: 304-321). Manaus (Amazonas State), presented the highest excess, with 758% (95%CI: 668-858) and São Paulo the lowest, with 174% (95%CI: 164-183). Early excess mortality was detected in Epidemiological Weeks (EW) 9-12 in Belém (Pará State), Fortaleza (Ceará State), and São Paulo. In general, excess mortality was relatively higher in the 40-59-year age bracket and in men. Excess mortality was regionally heterogeneous, with 2,463% (95%CI: 1,881-3,281) in EW 17-20 in Manaus (North Region) and 808% (95%CI: 612-1,059) in EW 28-32 in Curitiba (Paraná State, South Region). The high and heterogeneous percentage of excess respiratory deaths suggests high underreporting of COVID-19 deaths, which highlights regional inequalities and the need for revision of deaths associated with respiratory symptoms.","Orellana, Jesem Douglas Yamall; Marrero, Lihsieh; Horta, Bernardo Lessa",Cadernos de saude publica,https://doi.org/10.1590/0102-311x00328720; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34008791/,840

Recently, many instruments have been developed for ""precoagulation"" of liver parenchyma before sharp transection, but suffer from the possibility of injuring major blood and biliary vessels that are not well-visualized, along with high cost. In this article, we describe a ""postcoagulation"" technique combining clamp dissection and sealing of vessels under direct vision using a tissue-sealing device. STUDY DESIGN Clinical evaluation of 400 patients from 2 centers subjected to liver resection using this technique. RESULTS There were no cases complicated by hemorrhage. There was an incidence of 1.8% for bile leaks. This low incidence of biloma formation was seen even with the high incidence (49%) of abnormal parenchyma encountered in this cohort. CONCLUSIONS Combining the clamp-crushing method with use of the LigaSure device (Valleylab) allows identification of intraparenchymal vessels followed by sealing.

We employed resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), in conjunction with graph-theoretical analysis and a newly developed functional ""disruption index,"" to study whole-brain as well as local functional changes in patients with unilateral SSNHL. We also assessed the potential of graph-theoretical measures as biomarkers of disease, in terms of their relationship to clinically relevant audiological parameters. Eight patients with moderate or severe unilateral SSNHL and 15 healthy controls were included in this prospective pilot study. All patients underwent rs-fMRI to study potential changes in brain connectivity. From rs-fMRI data, global and local graph-theoretical measures, disruption index, and audiological examinations were estimated. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to study the differences between SSNHL patients and healthy controls. Associations between brain metrics and clinical variables were studied using multiple linear regressions, and the presence or absence of brain network hubs was assessed using Fisher's exact test. No statistically significant differences between SSNHL patients and healthy controls were found in global or local network measures. However, when analyzing brain networks through the disruption index, we found a brain-wide functional network reorganization (p < 0.001 as compared with controls), whose extent was associated with clinical impairment (p < 0.05). We also observed several functional hubs in SSNHL patients that were not present in healthy controls and vice versa. Our results demonstrate a brain involvement in SSNHL patients, not detectable using conventional graph-theoretical analysis, which may yield subtle disease clues and possibly aid in monitoring disease progression in clinical trials.","Minosse, Silvia; Garaci, Francesco; Martino, Federica; Di Mauro, Roberta; Melis, Milena; Di Giuliano, Francesca; Picchi, Eliseo; Guerrisi, Maria; Floris, Roberto; Di Girolamo, Stefano; Toschi, Nicola",NMR in biomedicine,https://doi.org/10.1002/nbm.4544; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046962/,840

Instead of reversing the many gains made through locally driven development partnerships with international funding agencies for other viral diseases like HIV, we must use this opportunity to adapt the many lessons learned to address the burden of Covid-19. Programs like the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare are currently leveraging widely available technologies in Africa to prevent patients from experiencing significant interruptions in care as the healthcare system adjusts to the challenges presented by Covid-19. These approaches are designed to preserve social contact while incorporating physical distancing. The gains and successes made through approaches like group-based medical care must not only continue but can help expand upon the extraordinary success of programs like President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.","Pastakia, Sonak D; Braitstein, Paula; Galárraga, Omar; Genberg, Becky; Said, Jamil; Vedanthan, Rajesh; Wachira, Juddy; Hogan, Joseph W",AIDS,https://doi.org/10.1097/qad.0000000000002605; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32889851/,840

95532,Single-port laparoscopic parastomal hernia repair with modified sugarbaker technique.,2014,"INTRODUCTION The impact of targeted embolization of ruptured cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM)-associated arterial aneurysms in the acute phase of bleeding is not well known. The objective of our study was to analyze the safety and efficacy of this treatment strategy with special emphasis on its protective effect against rebleeding. METHODS From a prospective database, all patients presenting between December 2005 and March 2012 with a ruptured cerebral AVM associated with arterial aneurysms contiguous to the hemorrhage were selected. Hemorrhagic stroke severity and clinical outcome were measured using, respectively, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. RESULTS Twenty-five patients with ruptured cerebral AVMs associated with 31 arterial aneurysms contiguous with the hemorrhage were included. In the first group of 17 patients, the mean time to treatment was 30.1 h, while in the second group with 1 patient in poor initial clinical conditions and 7 admitted 7 to 28 days after bleeding, it was 17 days. All arterial aneurysms were totally occluded. Four patients presented rebleeding before treatment (mean interval 9.6 days) and four had rebleeding after treatment (mean interval 8.25 months). At a mean follow-up of 56 months, 21 patients were alive (19 mRS ≤ 2, 2 mRS > 2). Three patients died 2 days, 9 days, and 2 months after bleeding and another died of rebleeding of her residual AVM 19 months after treatment. Treatment-related morbidity and mortality were, respectively, 4 and 0%. CONCLUSION Selective embolization of arterial aneurysms associated with ruptured AVMs is a safe procedure and could lower the immediate risk of rebleeding.","Signorelli, Francesco; Gory, Benjamin; Pelissou-Guyotat, Isabelle; Guyotat, Jacques; Riva, Roberto; Dailler, Frédéric; Turjman, Francis",Neuroradiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00234-014-1395-2; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24973129/,840

OBJECTIVES To evaluate the overall outcome for dogs with NSAID overdose treated with TPE and to determine if any presenting factors can predict or influence overall outcome. Secondary objectives included investigating TPE complications as well as the utility of other adjunctive treatments. ANIMALS Eleven client-owned dogs presented for NSAID overdose that received TPE. All patients also received additional supportive treatment including IV lipid infusion. METHODS Retrospective review of medical records. RESULTS Eleven cases were included in the study. Of these, the NSAID ingested was ibuprofen in 6 (54.5%), naproxen in 4 (36.4%), and deracoxib in 1 (9.1%). All dogs survived to discharge with 3 (27.3%) developing acute kidney injury during hospitalization. A larger initial dose of NSAID ingested was associated with a higher maximum serum creatinine concentration during hospitalization (P = .04) and larger change in serum creatinine concentration from baseline (P = .02). Six dogs (54.5%) developed complications associated with TPE. The use of other treatments did not affect the overall outcome. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE We identified TPE as an effective treatment for NSAID overdose with good outcomes despite high doses of NSAID ingestion in dogs treated with a single TPE treatment. Complications were common but did not affect the final outcome. Therapeutic plasma exchange should be considered in patients presenting for high-dose NSAID ingestion.","Rosenthal, Melisa G; Labato, Mary A",Journal of veterinary internal medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/jvim.15420; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30698297/,840

The AWE substrate is prepared by the enzymatic conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin in the presence of collagen, fibrin, and elastin to form an insoluble planar matrix. AWE substrate was placed on Franz Diffusion Cells for continuously monitoring the debridement progress. A parallel in vivo study was performed using pig thermal-burn wounds. Papain at concentrations of 200, 400, 800, and 1,600 U/mg was used as the model debriding enzyme for both studies. The data from the first 5 hours of the in vitro testing showed that debriding activity increased as the enzyme concentration increased. The histological results of the in vivo biopsy samples showed that enzyme doses above 800 and 1,600 U/mg successfully achieved debridement on day 8, while lower treatment groups still contained eschar tissue. Using the histological measurement results (wound depth score) a dose response that correlated to the in vitro assessment was found. Granulation tissue maturity and reepithelialization displayed correlation with the enzyme dose. Results indicate that AWE substrate can be used to predict debridement efficacy in vitro when correlation to the in vivo assessment is achieved.","Shi, Lei; Ermis, Ryan; Lam, Kan; Cowart, Jerry; Attar, Paul; Aust, Duncan",Wound repair and regeneration : official publication of the Wound Healing Society [and] the European Tissue Repair Society,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1524-475x.2009.00545.x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19903306/,840

This virus leads to dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome, benign syndrome, and severe syndrome and due to its infection there occurs alterations at multiple levels such as gene expression and the pathway levels. So, it is critical to understand the pathogenesis of dengue infection in terms of gene expression and the associated functions. METHODS For this purpose, here, we have analyzed the temporal gene expression profiling for dengue hemorrhagic fever dataset at 12, 24, and 48 hours. RESULTS The outcome appears that the dengue hemorrhagic fever evolve differently at different time periods or stages. Counclusions: The change in gene expression pattern increases exponentially from 12 hours to 48 hours and the number of altered functions (pathways) also increases. Wnt, apoptosis, transcription signaling are among the critical pathways which are dominantly altered. In the initial phase (first 12 hours) only two pathways are altered due to dengue infection while in the next 12 hours, eight pathways are altered, and finally in the next 24 hours 11 pathways are altered and most of these 11 pathways are very critical in terms of biological pathways and functions.","Warsi, Mohiuddin Khan; Kamal, Mohammad Azhar; Baeshen, Mohammed Nabih; Izhari, Mohammad Asrar; Firoz, Ahmad; Mobashir, Mohammad",Current pharmaceutical design,https://doi.org/10.2174/1381612826666201106093148; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33155901/,840

We conducted a systematic review, according to the PRISMA guidelines comparing clinical and peri-operative outcomes of SILC and conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy (CLC). METHOD A literature search, including only randomised controlled trials (RCTs), was performed via PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library and Embase database. The reviewers extracted data from the manuscripts of selected articles including patient demographics, operative time, morbidity rate, post-operative length of stay, conversion rate, cost data, pain and satisfaction with cosmetic results. RESULT Seventeen RCTs matching the inclusion criteria were finally selected for the analysis. A total of 1293 patients were involved in the review, including 663 (51.3 %) patients who have undergone SILC and 630 (48.7 %) patients who have undergone CLC. Post-operative pain was significantly worse in SILC patients in four studies, in CLC patients in four studies, while in the remnants seven studies, no differences in pain scores were found. Data on satisfaction for post-operative cosmetics were significantly better for SILC patients in all studies but two. Operating time was significantly longer in SILC group while there is no statistically significant difference in conversion rate. Morbidity rate was similar in both groups, as was the incidence of bile duct injuries. Costs were significantly higher in SILC group. SILC was considered a more challenging procedure in all studies. CONCLUSION The role of SILC is still controversial. Until now, no real significant benefit has been proven: overall satisfaction is the only clear advantage of SILC, and this is mainly related to cosmetic results. Indications to SILC are mainly limited to patients with uncomplicated disease, with BMI ≤ 30 kg/m(2), whose surgery is unlikely to be converted to an open or multiport approach.","Lirici, Marco Maria; Tierno, Simone Maria; Ponzano, Cecilia",Surgical endoscopy,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00464-016-4757-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26895901/,840

METHODS Women who sustained third- or fourth-degree obstetric tears were included prospectively in the study following anatomic primary repair. Women treated with conventional primary repair prior to the study period comprised the control group. Three-dimensional endoanal ultrasonography (3D-EAUS) images were classified according to the EAUS defect score, and incontinence according to St Mark's score. RESULTS Sixty-three women were included in the study group and 61 in the control group, with mean follow-up times of 11 and 21 months, respectively. Among women who had not delivered vaginally prior to the tear, St Mark's score ≥ 3 was reported by 9.6% (5/52) in the study group and 37.5% (15/40) in the control group at follow-up (P = 0.002). The corresponding numbers among women who had previously delivered vaginally were 36.4% (4/11) and 42.9% (9/21), respectively (non-significant). St Mark's score correlated with the EAUS defect score (P = 0.017). An EAS defect exceeding 50% of the sphincter length was significantly less common in the study group, and in a multivariable logistic regression model, mode of repair (anatomic vs conventional) was the only factor explaining the difference in EAS sphincter length between the two groups (P = 0.007). CONCLUSION Improved continence status after anatomic primary repair was associated with a better longitudinal reconstruction of the EAS, while the integrity of the IAS did not differ between the groups. Women with a history of vaginal delivery prior to the sphincter tear had an inferior outcome regardless of mode of repair.","Norderval, S; Røssaak, K; Markskog, A; Vonen, B",Ultrasound in obstetrics & gynecology : the official journal of the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology,https://doi.org/10.1002/uog.10154; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22125165/,840

OBJECTIVE To describe the trajectory of poststroke cognition and the factors that moderate it across intervention and observational cohorts. METHODS Six databases were searched up to January 2020. Studies describing quantitative changes in cognition in adults poststroke were included. Interventions were classified into pharmacological, therapist-led, nonroutine/alternative, and usual care. Summary estimates were compared via hierarchical mixed-effects models. Age, recovery stage, stroke etiology, cognitive domain targeted in studies, and intervention types were investigated as moderators of cognition. Recovery stage and intervention were further analyzed in a multiplicative metaregression model. RESULTS A total of 43 intervention trials and 79 observation cohorts involving 28 222 stroke participants were included. Heterogeneity was significant (τ2 = 0.09; CI = 0.01-0.21, P < .001) with no evidence of publication bias. Cognitive recovery was greater in intervention trials (g = 0.47; CI = 0.37-0.58) than observational cohorts (g = 0.28; CI = 0.20-0.36) across all moderators analyzed. Nonroutine/alternative and pharmacological trials achieved the best overall results (g = 0.57, CI = 0.42-0.73, and g = 0.52, CI = 0.30-0.74, respectively), followed by therapist-led (g = 0.46; CI = 0.17-0.74), and usual care (g = 0.28; CI = 0.11-0.45) interventions.

CONCLUSION Cognitive recovery is possible using different controlled interventions in all recovery stages, with smaller benefits ≥2 years poststroke. Longer-term studies are needed to determine the role of nonroutine/alternative therapies and the association between cognitive recovery and performance in everyday activities.","Saa, Juan Pablo; Tse, Tamara; Baum, Carolyn M; Cumming, Toby; Josman, Naomi; Rose, Miranda; O'Keefe, Sophie; Sewell, Katherine; Nguyen, Vinh; Carey, Leeanne M",Neurorehabilitation and neural repair,https://doi.org/10.1177/15459683211017501; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34027728/,840
102843,Evaluation of the radiological gastric capacity and evolution of the BMI 2-3 years after sleeve gastrectomy.,2009,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Status of collateral circulation is a strong predictor of outcome after acute ischemic stroke. Our aim was to compare the predictive value of strategies for collateral blood flow assessment with dynamic computed tomographic angiography (CTA) and conventional single-phase CT angiography. METHODS Patients with a proximal middle cerebral artery occlusion underwent noncontrast CT, single-phase CTA and whole brain CT perfusion/dynamic CTA within 9 hours after stroke onset. We defined poor outcome as a score on the modified Rankin Scale score of ≥3. The association between collateral score and clinical outcome at 3 months was analyzed with Poisson regression. The prognostic value of collateral scoring with dynamic CTA and single-phase CTA in addition to age, stroke severity, and noncontrast CT was assessed with logistic regression and summarized with the area under the curve. RESULTS Seventy patients were included, with a mean age of 68 years. We observed an increased risk of poor outcome in patients with poor collaterals on single-phase CTA (risk ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval, 1.0-3.1) and on dynamic CTA (risk ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.5-2.7). The prediction of poor clinical outcome by means of collateral adjustment was better with dynamic CTA (area under the curve, 0.84; likelihood ratio test P<0.01) than by single-phase CTA (area under the curve, 0.80; likelihood ratio test P=0.33). CONCLUSIONS Collateral assessment with dynamic CTA better predicts clinical outcome at 3 months than single-phase conventional CTA.

103337,Risk and consequences of dehydration following colorectal cancer resection with diverting ileostomy. A systematic review and meta-analysis.,2021-03-30,"OBJECTIVE Integrated Vascular Surgery Residency (IVSR) is among the most competitive specialties, but little is known about the applicant perspective. The COVID-19 outbreak impacted the 2021 IVSR match due to travel restrictions. We sought to better understand pre-pandemic applicant recruitment strategies, logistics of away rotations, and the residency interview process to identify areas for improvement in the application process. METHODS An anonymous survey was sent to matched students in 2020, inquiring about motivations for pursuing VS, logistic of away rotations and interviews, and factors influencing students' rank lists. RESULTS Seventy of the 73 matched students completed the survey (95.9% response rate). The median age was 27 (25-41), 32.9% were female, 91.4% were US medical students, and 77.1% were from institutions with a VS training program. Factors most strongly influencing the decision to choose VS as a career were interest in open vascular procedures, endovascular procedures, perceived job satisfaction, emerging technologies, and influence of a mentor. The prospect of the job market, future salary, and competitiveness of the application process had the least impact. Of the matched students, 82.9% completed an away rotation (median 2; range 1-4), with 51.7% of students paying a total cost of more than $2500. Fifty percent of students matched either at their home institution or where they had performed an away rotation. Students reported application submissions to a median of 50 programs (range 1-70) and interviewed at 17 (range 1-28), with 40% of students paying a total of more than $4000 for interview costs. The most significant factors affecting students' rank lists included: program culture, open aortic surgical volume, geography, and complex endovascular procedure volume. Tours of facilities, resident salary, and male/female distribution had the least importance. CONCLUSIONS Successfully matched applicants in 2020 prioritized operative case volume and program collegiality when ranking programs. Despite their high cost, away rotations played an important role in the Match, suggesting that time spent at potential institutions allowed ideal assessment of factors for students. The high average number of away rotations and in-person interviews performed in 2019-2020 was limited for the 2021 Match due to COVID-19 restrictions. Programs will have to continue developing creative alternatives or additions to away rotations and the application processes to assure continued success in future post-pandemic Match cycles.","Fereydooni, Arash; Ramirez, Joel L; Morrow, Katherine L; Chandra, Venita; Coleman, Dawn M; Lee, Jason T",Journal of vascular surgery,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jvs.2021.05.014; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34023431/,840
104610,Biologic meshes in colorectal surgery.,2012,"INTRODUCTION Nonunion is a known complication following fracture in the setting of radiotherapy. Free vascularized fibular (FVF) flaps have been used successfully in the treatment of segmental bone defects; however, their efficacy in the treatment of radiated nonunions is limited. The purpose of the study was to evaluate the outcome following FVFG for radiation-associated femoral fracture nonunions. METHODS 23 (11 male and 12 female; mean age 60 ± 12 years) patients underwent FVF for radiation-associated femoral fracture nonunions. The most common indication for radiotherapy was soft tissue sarcomas (n = 16). The mean follow-up was 5 ± 4 years. Mean radiation dose was 51 ± 14 Gy at a mean of 11 ± 3 years prior to FVF. The mean FVF length was 17 ± 4 cm and placed commonly with an intramedullary nail (n = 18). RESULTS First time union was 52% (n = 12) following additional bone grafting, the overall union was 78% (n = 18) at a mean of 13 ± 6 months. Musculoskeletal Tumor Society scores improved from 30% preoperatively to 73% at latest follow-up (p < 0.0001). Five fractures failed to unite; 3 were converted to proximal femoral replacements. CONCLUSIONS FVF are a reasonable treatment option for radiation-associated femoral fracture nonunions, providing a union rate of 78% and an improvement in functional outcome.

The chameleon can capture prey by great distances with the assistance of its highly stretchable and ballistic tongue. Inspired by this biological teacher, here we demonstrate the fabrication of flexible electromagnetic manipulators. As-prepared flexible electromagnetic manipulator can reach maximum velocity of 8.1m/s and acceleration of 627m/s2 respectively at an applied voltage of 360V. The working mechanism of this flexible electromagnetic manipulator has been studied based on the Maxwell and Abaqus simulation. Diverse parameters, including the length of magnetic tube (the cylindrical magnet) and the whole manipulators and applied voltage values, have been considered to tune the ejecting performances of the manipulators. Furthermore, flexible electromagnetic manipulators can be upgraded to capture various objects by attaching a mechanical force triggered gripper to their top pads. With this design, the velocity of gripper can be significantly improved(the maximum velocity of this is 8.1m/s. However, the soft gripper in the previous research does not have the characteristics of fast movement ), thus making it possible to get objects without approaching them, in another word, we can catch objects even though they are far away from us ,which provide a possibility of long-distance capture.We believe this kind of bio-inspired fabrication is a powerful strategy to design and synthesize flexible even stretchable manipulators, extending the boundaries of conventional manipulators for soft robots.","Kan, Longxin; Lei, Fengxiao; Song, Bo; Su, Bin; Shi, Yusheng",Bioinspiration & biomimetics,https://doi.org/10.1088/1748-3190/aba444; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32647093/,840
106949,"Sleeve gastrectomy as a stand-alone bariatric operation for severe, morbid, and super obesity.",2013,"PURPOSE To perform a systematic review identifying how dietary factors are related to cognitive function in cancer survivors who are not currently undergoing primary treatment. METHODS Using the PRISMA framework, a search was conducted for studies published before February 2019 across multiple databases, identifying 2304 unique articles. Twelve met final inclusion criteria and were evaluated through narrative synthesis. This review was registered with the International Prospective Register Of Systematic Reviews (CRD42018111941). RESULTS Included studies were heterogeneous in methodology and in dietary and cognitive variables investigated making direct comparisons difficult. Evidence of a relationship between diet and cognition was mixed; the most consistent evidence was identified in relation to a positive relationship between fruit and vegetable intake and cognitive function (both self-reported and objectively tested) in five out of six studies, but was not concordant across all studies. CONCLUSION Preliminary evidence exists that a greater fruit and vegetable intake is associated with better cognitive functioning in cancer survivors, as has been reported in healthy populations; however, these data are correlational and include relatively small samples. Most evidence related to breast cancer survivors, with individual studies extending to colorectal and stomach cancer survivors. Experimental trials are needed to identify causal attribution of dietary factors on cognitive function in cancer survivors. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS At this time, there is not sufficient evidence to make dietary or nutritional recommendations specifically for improving cognitive function in cancer survivors. This should be considered in light of the general paucity of research on this subject, necessitating further investigations.","Coro, Daniel; Hutchinson, Amanda; Dahlenburg, Sophie; Banks, Siobhan; Coates, Alison",Journal of cancer survivorship : research and practice,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11764-019-00796-4; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31399855/,840

Nasopharyngeal swab has been the gold standard for the diagnosis of COVID-19. However, it is not an ideal screening procedure for massive screening as it implicates the patient's stay in the hospital or at home until diagnosis, thus causing crowding of the specimen at the diagnostic centers.

A prospective double-blinded randomized control trial.,2020-02-18,"OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence of clinically significant diaphragmatic injuries and local tumor progression after microwave ablation of hepatic tumors abutting the diaphragm. MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study included 55 peripheral hepatic tumors abutting the diaphragm treated by microwave ablation versus a control group of 15 centrally located tumors. Treated tumors were further subdivided according to the use of artificial ascites (fluid vs no fluid) and whether instilled fluid achieved displacement of the liver surface away from the diaphragm (displaced vs nondisplaced). Measurements of tumor size, distance to the diaphragm, ablation zone size, displacement distance, length of the ablation zone along the liver capsule, diaphragm thickness, diaphragmatic hernia, and local tumor progression were made on pre- and postablation CT and MRI. The electronic medical record was reviewed for patient self-reported pain scores and other symptoms. Data were analyzed by use of the Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher exact tests. RESULTS There were no cases of diaphragmatic hernia in peripheral or central tumors. Postablation diaphragm thickness was higher in peripheral hepatic tumors than in control tumors. Peripheral tumors had an overall higher incidence of postprocedure shoulder pain (18% vs 0%) and local tumor progression (5.5% vs 0%) compared with control tumors, but these differences did not achieve statistical significance (p = 0.2 and p = 1, respectively). CONCLUSION Our study shows that microwave ablation of peridiaphragmatic hepatic tumors is safe, without incidence of diaphragmatic hernia, and can be performed with a low rate of local tumor progression.","Smolock, Amanda R; Lubner, Meghan G; Ziemlewicz, Timothy J; Hinshaw, J Louis; Kitchin, Douglas R; Brace, Christopher L; Lee, Fred T",AJR.

110267,European Hernia Society guidelines on prevention and treatment of parastomal hernias.,2018,"BACKGROUND When health service providers (HSP) plan to develop electronic health (eHealth) resources for health service users (HSU), the latter's involvement is essential. Typically, however, HSP, HSU, and technology developers engaged to produce the resources lack expertise in participatory design methodologies suited to the eHealth context. Furthermore, it can be difficult to identify an established method to use, or determine how to work stepwise through any particular process. OBJECTIVE We sought to summarize the evidence about participatory methods and frameworks used to engage HSU in the development of eHealth resources from the beginning of the design process. METHODS We searched for studies reporting participatory processes in initial development of eHealth resources from 2006 to 2016 in 9 bibliographic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Emcare, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ACM Guide to Computing Literature, and IEEE Xplore. From 15,117 records initially screened on title and abstract for relevance to eHealth and early participatory design, 603 studies were assessed for eligibility on full text. The remaining 90 studies were rated by 2 reviewers using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool Version 2011 (Pluye et al; MMAT) and analyzed with respect to health area, purpose, technology type, and country of study. The 30 studies scoring 90% or higher on MMAT were included in a detailed qualitative synthesis. RESULTS Of the 90 MMAT-rated studies, the highest reported (1) health areas were cancer and mental disorders, (2) eHealth technologies were websites and mobile apps, (3) targeted populations were youth and women, and (4) countries of study were the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. Of the top 30 studies the highest reported participatory frameworks were User-Centered Design, Participatory Action Research Framework, and the Center for eHealth Research and Disease Management (CeHRes) Roadmap, and the highest reported model underpinning development and engagement was Social Cognitive Theory. Of the 30 studies, 4 reported on all the 5 stages of the CeHRes Roadmap. CONCLUSIONS The top 30 studies yielded 24 participatory frameworks. Many studies referred to using participatory design methods without reference to a framework. The application of a structured framework such as the CeHRes Roadmap and a model such as Social Cognitive Theory creates a foundation for a well-designed eHealth initiative that ensures clarity and enables replication across participatory design projects. The framework and model need to be clearly articulated and address issues that include resource availability, responsiveness to change, and the criteria for good practice. This review creates an information resource for future eHealth developers, to guide the design of their eHealth resource with a framework that can support further evaluation and development.

METHODOLOGY This paper reports the results of an observational study on the extent of antibiotic use in 52 randomly selected patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) at the University Hospital in Pristina, Kosovo with severe forms of COVID-19. RESULTS Antibiotics were prescribed in all the cases (52; 100%). Of the 52 patients, 1) 13 (25%) were given antibiotics before hospitalisation, 2) 49 (94.2%) during treatment in the ward and 3) 52 (100%) during treatment in the ICU. Most often, empirical antibiotics were administered in 32 cases (61.5%) to treat methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections, and in 23 patients (44.2%) to treat atypical pathogens. The most prescribed antibiotics were ceftriaxone/cefotaxime plus macrolide in (17 cases; 32.7%), ceftriaxone/cefotaxime in (15 cases; 28.8%), ampicillin/amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid or sulbactam (five cases; 9.6%), and quinolones (five cases; 9.6%). Imipenem was the most frequently used antibiotic in the ICU (30 cases; 57.7%), followed by ceftriaxone (28 cases; 53.8%), and piperacillin/tazobactam and fluoroquinolone (17 cases; 32.7%). In 18 cases (34.6%), three antibiotics were given simultaneously; two antibiotics in 29 cases (55.8%) and in five cases (9.6%) only one antibiotic was given. The mean duration of antibiotic treatment was 12.71 days (3-22 days; SD 4.026).

Because bicycling continues to grow in popularity,* primarily among U.S. adults, examining the strategies that mitigate the risk for TBI is important. CDC analyzed data from the National Electronic Injury Sursveillance System-All Injury Program (NEISS-AIP) to determine the incidence of EDs for bicycle-related TBIs during 2009-2018. An estimated 596,972 ED visits for bicycle-related TBIs occurred in the United States during the study period. Rates of ED visits were highest among adult males (aged ≥18 years) and among children and adolescents aged 10-14 years during 2009-2018. Overall, the rate of ED visits for bicycle-related TBIs decreased by approximately one half (48.7%) among children and by 5.5% among adults. As the number of persons riding bicycles increases, expansion of comprehensive bicycling safety interventions for bicyclists and drivers by states and local communities, such as interventions to increase driver compliance with traffic laws and helmet use among riders, improvements in bicycling infrastructure, and customized interventions for males and other groups at high risk might help reduce bicycle-related injuries.","Sarmiento, Kelly; Haileyesus, Tadesse; Waltzman, Dana; Daugherty, Jill",MMWR.

The SARS-CoV-2 is causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. A set of 58 molecules belongs to the naphthyridine and quinoline derivatives have been recently synthesized and considered for structure-based virtual screening against Nsp16-Nsp10. Molecular docking was virtually performed to screen for anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity against Nsp16-Nsp10. Fourteen out of fifty-eight compounds were exhibited binding affinity higher than co-crystal bound ligand s-adenosylmethionine (SAM) toward Nsp16-Nsp10. Further, the in silico pharmacokinetics assessment was carried out and it was found that two molecules possess the acceptable pharmacokinetic profile, hence considered promising Nsp16-Nsp10 inhibitors. The binding interaction analysis was revealed some crucial binding interactions between the final selected two molecules and ligand-binding amino acid residues of Nsp16-Nsp10 protein. In order to explore the characteristics of the protein-ligand complex and how selected small molecules retained inside the receptor cavity in dynamic states, all-atoms conventional molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was performed. Several factors were obtained from the MD simulation trajectory evidently suggested the potentiality of the molecules and stability of the protein-ligand complex. Finally, the binding affinity of both molecules and SAM was explored through the MM-GBSA approach which explained that both molecules possess strong affection towards the Nsp16-Nsp10. Hence, from the pharmacoinformatics assessment, it can be concluded that both heterocyclic compounds might be crucial for SARS-CoV-2 inhibition, subjected to experimental validation.

However, the clinical prognosis and molecular mechanisms of TMEM161B-AS1 in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) remain still unknown. Here, TMEM161B-AS1 and HIF1AN were significantly lower in ESCC tissues than in normal samples, and their low expressions were both related to TNM stage, lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis of ESCC patients. Functionally, TMEM161B-AS1 overexpression or miR-23a-3p depletion suppressed the proliferation, invasion and glycolysis as well as reduced glucose consumption and lactate production in ESCC cells. Mechanistically, TMEM161B-AS1 manipulated HIF1AN expression by competitively sponging miR-23a-3p in ESCC cells. MiR-23a-3p mimic and HIF1AN siRNA partly reversed cell phenotypes mediated by TMEM161B-AS1 in ESCC cells. Collectively, TMEM161B-AS1, miR-23a-3p and HIF1AN may be tightly involved in ESCC development and progression as well as patients' prognosis, and TMEM161B-AS1/miR-23a-3p/HIF1AN signal axis may be a promising target for the treatment of ESCC patients.","Shi, Zuxuan; Li, Guanghui; Li, Zhen; Liu, Junhao; Tang, Yu",Journal of cellular and molecular medicine,https://doi.org/10.1111/jcmm.16652; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34046994/,840

An existing workaround to the lack of medical training images involves pre-training deep learning models on ImageNet, a non-medical dataset with millions of training images. However, the modality of ImageNet's dataset samples consisting of natural images in RGB frequently differs from the modality of medical images, consisting largely of images in grayscale such as X-ray and MRI scan imaging. While this method may be effectively applied to non-medical tasks such as human face detection, it proves ineffective in many areas of medical imaging. Recently proposed generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are able to synthesize new medical images. By utilizing generated images, we may overcome the modality gap arising from current transfer learning methods.

These EOs are present in many over- the- counter balms and oils. The effect of exposure to these EOs and occurrence of seizure is not systematically studied. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between essential oils and the first episode of seizure and breakthrough seizures in known epileptic patients. METHODS This was a multi-center prospective study, conducted in four hospitals over four years. Every person presenting with the first episode of seizure or breakthrough seizure was asked about exposure to EOs, mode of exposure, time to onset of a seizure in relationship to exposure, duration of seizure, type of seizure, and antiepileptic drug therapy. RESULTS During the four-year period there were 55 patients with essential oil-related seizure (EORS). 22(40 %) had essential oil-induced seizures (EOIS) and 33(60 %) had essential oil-provoked seizures (EOPS). The female: male ratio was 1:1.1, the age of the patients ranged from 8 months to 77 years. In the EOIS group, 95 % had generalized tonic-clonic seizures and 5% had focal impaired awareness seizures. In the EOPS group, 42.4 % had focal impaired awareness seizures, 27.3 % generalized tonic-clonic seizures, 15 % focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures, and 15 % focal aware motor seizures. EOs implicated were preparations containing eucalyptus and camphor. CONCLUSION Exposure to essential oils of eucalyptus and camphor is an under-recognized cause of the first and breakthrough seizure.

The SAND balloon catheter was directly inserted into the expanded hydronephrotic sac, and the liquid was extracted, appropriately. Urine leakage from the hydronephrotic sac could be avoided because the puncture site was sealed firmly between the two adjacent balloons at the tip of the catheter. Disposal counter traction using the catheter facilitated the mobilization of the hydronephrotic sac. RESULTS The patient was discharged 3 days after undergoing this procedure.

PIEB compared with a continuous epidural infusion (CEI) has the potential advantage of greater spread within the epidural space and therefore better sensory blockade. Studies have demonstrated a local anesthetic-sparing effect, fewer instrumental vaginal deliveries, less motor blockade, and improvements in maternal satisfaction with PIEB compared with CEI. However, the optimal PIEB regimen and pump settings remain unknown, and there are a number of logistical issues and practical considerations that should be considered when implementing PIEB. The PIEB bolus size and interval, PIEB start time delay period, and patient-controlled epidural analgesia bolus size and lockout time can influence the efficacy of PIEB used for epidural labor analgesia. Educating all members of the health care team is critical to the success of the technique.

116518,A personal perspective of the development of MRI for Total Mesorectal Excision surgery.,2018,"STUDY DESIGN Prospective, randomized, double-blinded trial OBJECTIVE.: The aim of this study was to investigate whether the mode of tracheal intubation affects intraoperative endotracheal tube cuff pressure (ETCP) on retractor splay and post-ACSS voice outcome. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA The combination of endotracheal tube (ETT) and cervical retractors has been implicated in recurrent laryngeal nerve compression and neurpopraxia after anterior cervical spine surgery (ACSS). The asymmetric position of the oroETT within the larynx, as being fixed distally by the cuff and proximally by taping on one side of the mouth, may contribute to unilateral vocal palsy. METHODS Adult patients undergoing ACSS were randomized to receive either nasotracheal or orotracheal intubation under anesthesia. The primary endpoint was the maximal ETCP when the retractors were set up. After the maximal ETCPs were recorded, then ETCPs were controlled to < 25 mmHg. Secondary endpoints were self-assessed hoarseness, pitch, and loudness of voice on postoperative days (PODs) 1, 2, 7, and 30. RESULTS We equally allocated 110 patients to nasotracheal and orotracheal intubation. The maximal ETCP during retractor splay did not differ for both the means and distributions of pressure range. After the surgery, more patients in the nasotracheal intubation group reported none or mild change of voice than did the orotracheal intubation group on PODs 1 and 2, in terms of hoarseness, pitch, and loudness (P = 0.001, 0.001, and 0.005, respectively, on POD 1; P = 0.002, 0.003, and 0.011, respectively, on POD 2). Mixed model analysis demonstrated that patients with nasotracheal intubation had significantly lower dysphonia scores after surgery (estimate treatment effect: -1.62, P < 0.0001). Statistics was adjusted to exclude interaction with ETT sizes. CONCLUSION The tracheal intubation modes did not affect ETCP during retractor splay. However, nasotracheal intubation had a beneficial effect on dysphonia recovery after ACSS.

116725,Quality of life after laparoscopic ventral rectopexy.,2016,"Characterization of the immune responses induced in the initial stages of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is of critical importance for an understanding of early viral pathogenesis and prophylactic vaccine design. Here, we used sequential plasma samples collected during the eclipse and exponential viral expansion phases from subjects acquiring HIV-1 (or, for comparison, hepatitis B virus [HBV]or hepatitis C virus [HCV]) to determine the nature and kinetics of the earliest systemic elevations in cytokine and chemokine levels in each infection. Plasma viremia was quantitated over time, and levels of 30 cytokines and chemokines were measured using Luminex-based multiplex assays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The increase in plasma viremia in acute HIV-1 infection was found to be associated with elevations in plasma levels of multiple cytokines and chemokines, including rapid and transient elevations in alpha interferon (IFN-alpha) and interleukin-15 (IL-15) levels; a large increase in inducible protein 10 (IP-10) levels; rapid and more-sustained increases in tumor necrosis factor alpha and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 levels; more slowly initiated elevations in levels of additional proinflammatory factors including IL-6, IL-8, IL-18, and IFN-gamma; and a late-peaking increase in levels of the immunoregulatory cytokine IL-10. Notably, there was comparatively little perturbation in plasma cytokine levels during the same phase of HBV infection and a delayed response of more intermediate magnitude in acute HCV infection, indicating that the rapid activation of a striking systemic cytokine cascade is not a prerequisite for viral clearance (which occurs in a majority of HBV-infected individuals). The intense early cytokine storm in acute HIV-1 infection may have immunopathological consequences, promoting immune activation, viral replication, and CD4(+) T-cell loss.","Stacey, Andrea R; Norris, Philip J; Qin, Li; Haygreen, Elizabeth A; Taylor, Elizabeth; Heitman, John; Lebedeva, Mila; DeCamp, Allan; Li, Dongfeng; Grove, Douglas; Self, Steven G; Borrow, Persephone",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01844-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19176632/,840

This study seeks to analyse the efficacy and safety of DPIA in bronchiectasis patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS Multi-centre study of historic cohorts. All the hospital centres in Spain were contacted in order to collect data on patients with a diagnosis of bronchiectasis who had taken at least one dose of DPIA. Its efficacy was analysed in clinical, functional and microbiological terms by comparing the year before and the year after the prescription of DPIA. Adverse effects and variables associated with these effects, or any need to withdraw the drug, were also analysed. RESULTS 164 patients from 33 Spanish centres were included; 86% and 14% of these were treated with dry powder colistin and tobramycin, respectively. Chronic bronchial infection by Pseudomonas aeruginosa was present in 86% of these patients, and DPIA significantly reduced the number of exacerbations, the quantity and purulence of sputum and the isolation of pathogenic microorganisms. The most common adverse effect was cough (40%), particularly in cases of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and a previous cough and in those patients who had difficulties in handling the device. These factors were associated with a higher level of withdrawal of the treatment. There were no serious adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS Our study suggests that DPIA are clinically efficacious and safe for treating bronchiectasis patients.

Cohort studies are an important tool for defining and understanding the causes behind these racial and ethnic inequalities. However, ethnic minority populations may be more likely to be excluded from such research. Therefore, the aim of this study is to systematically investigate and quantify racial and ethnic minority representation in dementia risk factor research. METHODS AND ANALYSIS The elements of this protocol have been designed in accordance with the relevant sections of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols which are specifically applicable to scoping review protocols. We will include population-based cohort studies looking at risk factors for dementia incidence in our review and assess the representation of racial and ethnic minority populations in these studies. We will use multiple strategies to identify relevant studies, including a systematic search of the following electronic databases: MEDLINE (Ovid SP), Embase (Ovid SP) and Scopus. Two review authors will independently perform title and abstract screening, full-text screening and data extraction. Included cohort studies will be evaluated using a comprehensive framework to assess racial/ethnic minority representation. Logistic regression will also be performed to describe associations between cohort study characteristics and outcomes related to racial and ethnic minority representation.

120775,Morbidity and mortality after closure of loop ileostomy.,2009,"OBJECTIVES To identify the prevalence and predictors of postoperative detrusor underactivity during the early postoperative period after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. METHODS We carried out a prospective observational study of 64 patients scheduled for robot-assisted radical prostatectomy using urodynamic study before and 1 month after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Detrusor underactivity was defined as maximum flow rate ≤15 mL/s and detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate ≤25 cmH2 O during voiding. Incidences of pre- and postoperative detrusor underactivity were assessed, and predictors of postoperative detrusor underactivity were determined using uni- and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Factors comprised patient characteristics (age, prostate weight etc.), operative factors (surgical duration, nerve sparing etc.) and preoperative urodynamic study parameters (maximum flow rate, bladder contractile index etc.). RESULTS Pre- and postoperative detrusor underactivity at 1 month after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy were detected in one patient (1.6%) and 24 patients (37.5%), respectively. Univariate analysis selected preoperative maximum flow rate (P = 0.02), detrusor pressure at maximum flow rate (P = 0.04) and bladder contractile index (P < 0.01) as predictors of postoperative detrusor underactivity (odds ratio 0.83, 0.97 and 0.94, respectively). On multivariate analyses, only preoperative bladder contractile index was associated with postoperative detrusor underactivity (P < 0.01; odds ratio 0.94). A cut-off of 102.8 offered optimal accuracy in receiver operating characteristic analysis. Patient characteristics and operative factors were not significantly associated with postoperative detrusor underactivity. CONCLUSIONS A comparatively high prevalence of postoperative detrusor underactivity is observed in patients at 1 month after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Patients with preoperative low bladder contractile index have a higher probability of developing early postoperative detrusor underactivity after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy.","Hata, Junya; Onagi, Akifumi; Tanji, Ryo; Honda-Takinami, Ruriko; Matsuoka, Kanako; Hoshi, Seiji; Sato, Yuichi; Ogawa, Soichiro; Kataoka, Masao; Haga, Nobuhiro; Kojima, Yoshiyuki",International journal of urology : official journal of the Japanese Urological Association,https://doi.org/10.1111/iju.14549; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33745187/,840

In the present work, a novel thermophilic extradiol dioxygenase from Thermomonospora curvata DSM43183 was cloned, expressed, and characterized by phylogenetic and biochemical analyses. This enzyme exhibited excellent thermo-tolerance, displaying optimal activity at 50 °C, remaining >40% activity at 70 °C. Structural modeling and molecular docking demonstrated that both active center and pocket-construction loops locate at the C-terminal domain. Site-specific mutants D285A, H205V, F301V based on a rational design were obtained to widen the entrance of substrates; resulting in significantly improved catalytic performance for all the 3 mutants. Compared to the wild-type, the mutant D285A showed remarkably improved activities with respect to the 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, catechol, and 3-chlorocatechol, by 17.7, 6.9, and 3.7-fold, respectively. The results thus verified the effectiveness of modeling guided design; and confirmed that the C-terminal loop structure indeed plays a decisive role in determining catalytic ring-opening efficiency and substrate specificity of the enzyme.

To select those patients most likely to benefit from EGFR inhibition, it can be advantageous to quantify the tumor EGFR status before and possibly during therapy. The aim of this study was to develop and characterize the (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 tracer to image EGFR targeting in vivo. METHODS The affinity and internalization kinetics of (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 were determined in vitro. The optimal protein-fragment dose for imaging was determined in nude mice with a subcutaneous head and neck carcinoma model (FaDu). Mice with FaDu tumors were imaged using ultra-high-resolution SPECT with (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 or (111)In-cetuximab IgG at 4, 24, 48, and 168 h after injection. Tumor tracer uptake was determined on micro-SPECT and autoradiography images of tumor sections. Immunohistochemical staining was used to analyze EGFR expression in the tumor. RESULTS In vitro, more than 50% of (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 was internalized into FaDu cells within 24 h. The half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 and (111)In-cetuximab was similar: 0.42 ± 0.16 nM versus 0.28 ± 0.14 nM, respectively. The protein dose-escalation study showed that the highest uptake of (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 in tumors was obtained at doses of 10 μg/mouse or less (13.5 ± 5.2 percentage injected dose per gram [%ID/g]). Tumor uptake of (111)In-cetuximab was significantly higher (26.9 ± 3.3 %ID/g, P < 0.01). However, because of rapid blood clearance, tumor-to-blood ratios at 24 h after injection were significantly higher for (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 (31.4 ± 3.8 vs. 1.7 ± 0.2, respectively; P < 0.001). The intratumoral distribution of (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 correlated well with the immunohistochemical distribution of EGFR (r = 0.64 ± 0.06, P < 0.0001). micro-SPECT images of (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 clearly showed preferential uptake in the tumor from 4 h onward, with superior tumor-to-background contrast at 24 h, compared with (111)In-cetuximab (107.0 ± 17.0 vs. 69.7 ± 3.9, respectively; P < 0.05). CONCLUSION (111)In-cetuximab-F(ab')2 displays higher tumor-to-blood ratios early after injection than (111)In-cetuximab in an HNSCC model, making it more suitable for EGFR visualization and potentially for selecting patients for treatment with EGFR inhibitors.","van Dijk, Laura K; Hoeben, Bianca A W; Kaanders, Johannes H A M; Franssen, Gerben M; Boerman, Otto C; Bussink, Johan","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine",https://doi.org/10.2967/jnumed.113.123612; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24136932/,840
122857,Tattooing: more than skin deep.,2013,"OBJECTIVE Management of chronic wounds remains one of the major challenges for health professionals and patients. An evidence-based decision is important to ensure that patients are receiving the best treatment proven to reduce healing time and improve outcomes, including economic benefits and patients' health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Due to recent restrictions because of the COVID-19 pandemic, including closure of wound care centres within hospitals and a drop in patient volume, chronic wound management needs simple-to-use dressings which are still effective and evidence-based solutions. This systematic review was conducted to identify the clinical evidence available on a sucrose octasulfate dressing (TLC-NOSF, UrgoStart dressing range, Laboratoires Urgo, France) to explore its efficacy in the management of chronic wounds, particularly lower limb ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers and pressure ulcers. METHOD A literature search of PubMed, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar was conducted based on the PICO model (patient/population, intervention, comparison and outcomes) to retrieve publications of different levels of evidence in order to evaluate outcomes of the use of TLC-NOSF dressings. RESULTS A total of 21 publications of different levels, ranging from double-blind randomised control trials to case reports, involving over 12,000 patients, were identified through PubMed, with a further eight publications through Google Scholar and two publications through Cochrane Library. A total of seven results were omitted due to the lack of relevance or repetition. CONCLUSION All the evidence provided suggest that these dressings provide clinicians with an evidence-based option for the management of chronic wounds; that the TLC-NOSF dressings are beneficial in promoting the healing process, reducing healing times, enhancing patients' HRQoL, and in allowing a more cost-effective procedure.","Nair, Harikrishna; Venkateshwaran, N; Seetharaman S, Selva; Deng, Wuquan; Uthaipaisanwong, Apinan; Galea, Emilio",Journal of wound care,https://doi.org/10.12968/jowc.2021.30.sup4.s42; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33856929/,840

The concept of a new team member, the digital navigator, able to assume this role is introduced as a solution. With a digital navigator, any clinic today can take advantage of digital health and smartphone tools to augment and expand existing telehealth and face to face care. The role of a digital navigator is suitable as an entry level healthcare role, additional training for an experienced clinician, and well suited to peer specialists. To facilitate the training of digital navigators, we draw upon our experience in creating the role and across health education to introduce a 10-h curriculum designed to train digital navigators across 5 domains: (1) core smartphone skills, (2) basic technology troubleshooting, (3) app evaluation, (4) clinical terminology and data, and (5) engagement techniques.

123964,Construct validity of an inanimate training model for laparoscopic appendectomy.,2013,"BACKGROUND The inflammatory burden influences therapeutic decisions in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). We aimed to study which commonly used markers of disease activity correlate best with inflammatory burden in patients with UC using leukocyte scintigraphy (single-photon emission computed tomography [SPECT-CT]) as the gold standard. METHODS Patients with different severity of UC underwent colonoscopy with biopsies and leukocyte SPECT-CT scintigraphy. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP), fecal calprotectin, and clinical questionnaires were collected. The maximum uptake of technetium-labeled leukocytes was calculated as a SPECT score for each colon segment and a summed activity score for 5 colonic segments combined. RESULTS Thirty patients with UC were included; 14 of 30 (47%) had left-sided colitis, and 16 of 30 (53%) had pancolitis. One patient (3%) had inactive UC, 5 of 30 (17%) had mild, 11 of 30 (37%) had moderate, and 13 of 30 (43%) had severe disease activity based on the endoscopic Mayo score. The endoscopic Mayo score correlated better with the SPECT score than with the ulcerative colitis endoscopic index of severity (UCEIS) (r = 0.50; P < 0.01 and r = 0.32; P = 0.08, respectively). The Geboes UC histologic score correlated equally well as the Mayo score (r = 0.50; P < 0.01). We found a significant correlation between scintigraphy and fecal calprotectin (r = 0.44; P = 0.02) but not with serum CRP (r = 0.25; P = 0.18). Fecal calprotectin reflected inflammatory burden significantly better in left-sided colitis (r = 0.80; P = 0.001) than in pancolitis (r = 0.22; P = 0.41). CONCLUSIONS The inflammatory burden in patients with UC, measured by SPECT-CT, is better reflected by the endoscopic Mayo score and the Geboes histologic score than by the UCEIS. Fecal calprotectin is a more accurate inflammatory marker than CRP, predominantly in patients with left-sided colitis.

124411,Laparoscopic hernia complexity predicts operative time and length of stay.,2014,"BACKGROUND Laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery is challenging. To help overcome current technical and ergonomic limitations, the da Vinci robotic platform can be applied to LESS. OBJECTIVES Our aim was to describe the surgical technique and to report the early outcomes of robotic LESS (R-LESS) radical prostatectomy (RP). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective review of prospectively captured R-LESS RP data was performed between May 2008 and May 2010. A total of 20 procedures were scheduled (12 with and 8 without pelvic lymph node dissection). SURGICAL PROCEDURE R-LESS prostatectomy was performed using the methods outlined in the paper and in the supplemental video material. INTERVENTIONS All patients underwent R-LESS RP by one high-volume surgeon. Single-port access was achieved via a commercially available multichannel port. The da Vinci S and da Vinci Si surgical platform was used with pediatric and standard instruments. MEASUREMENTS Preoperative, perioperative, pathologic, and functional outcomes data were analyzed. RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS The mean age was 60.4 yr; body mass index was 25.4 kg/m(2). The mean operative time was 189.5 min; estimated blood loss was 142.0 ml. The average length of stay was 2.7 d, and the visual analog pain score at discharge was 1.4 of 10. Four focal positive margins were encountered, with two occurring during the first three cases. Pathology revealed a Gleason score of 3+3 in 3 patients, 3+4 in 11 patients, 4+3 in 4 patients, and 4+4 in 2 patients. There were a total of four complications according to the Clavien system including one grade 1, two grade 2, and one grade 4. The median follow-up has been 4 mo (range: 1-24 mo). Study limitations include the small sample size, the short follow-up, and the lack of comparative cohort. CONCLUSIONS The R-LESS RP is technically feasible and reduces some of the difficulties encountered with conventional LESS RP.","White, Michael A; Haber, Georges-Pascal; Autorino, Riccardo; Khanna, Rakesh; Forest, Sylvain; Yang, Bo; Altunrende, Fatih; Stein, Robert J; Kaouk, Jihad H",European urology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eururo.2010.06.040; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20702030/,840
126122,Granulomas in Crohn's disease: does progression through the bowel layers affect presentation or predict recurrence?,2011,"INTRODUCTION Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is well known as a novel member of the coronavirus family which caused a sudden outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China that quickly developed into a global pandemic. No effective approaches are found as yet for the therapy and epidemiological control of this new virus. For this purpose, we searched the literature in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Knowledge, Google Scholar, and MeSH, from all years of study until 23rd of October 2020, for articles and abstracts describing SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, pneumonia, clinical trials, drug, treatment, and medicine. AREAS COVERED The present study aimed to comprehensively overview of the current literature on effective anti- SARS-CoV-2 drugs. EXPERT OPINION Since the beginning of this pandemic disease, many studies have been conducted to find effective drugs to prevent COVID-19, because there are no specific drugs for the treatment of this disease. Most of these drugs with the antiviral potential effect toward COVID-19 are already used as the treatment of other infectious diseases. Some drugs that show the promising therapeutic potential in the initial clinical studies include remdesivir as an inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and favipiravir as an inhibitor of virus replication. Currently, remdesivir received the FDA authorizes to use as an experimental drug for emergency use in COVID-19 patients.","Yaghoubi, Atieh; Amel Jamehdar, Saeid; Movaqar, Aref; Milani, Nasrin; Soleimanpour, Saman",Expert review of respiratory medicine,https://doi.org/10.1080/17476348.2021.1854092; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33215942/,840
129301,Transanal minimal invasive surgery for rectal lesions: should the defect be closed?,2015,"Post-translational modifications (PTMs) to the tails of the core histone proteins are critically involved in epigenetic regulation. Hypoxia affects histone modifications by altering the activities of histone-modifying enzymes and the levels of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) isoforms. Synthetic hypoxia mimetics promote a similar response, but how accurately the hypoxia mimetics replicate the effects of limited oxygen availability on the levels of histone PTMs is uncertain. Here we report studies on the profiling of the global changes to PTMs on intact histones in response to hypoxia/hypoxia-related stresses using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). We demonstrate that intact protein LC-MS profiling is a relatively simple and robust method for investigating potential effects of drugs on histone modifications. The results provide insights into the profiles of PTMs associated with hypoxia and inform on the extent to which hypoxia and hypoxia mimetics cause similar changes to histones. These findings imply chemically-induced hypoxia does not completely replicate the substantial effects of physiological hypoxia on histone PTMs, highlighting that caution should be used in interpreting data from their use.","Hsu, Kuo-Feng; Wilkins, Sarah E; Hopkinson, Richard J; Sekirnik, Rok; Flashman, Emily; Kawamura, Akane; McCullagh, James S O; Walport, Louise J; Schofield, Christopher J",Epigenetics,https://doi.org/10.1080/15592294.2020.1786305; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32609604/,840

However, whether proliferation of white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) requires regulation of the host cell cycle remains unclear. In the present study, we show that two WSSV paralogs, IE1 and WSV056, can interact with Litopenaeus vannamei retinoblastoma (Rb)-like protein (lv-RBL) through the conserved LxCxE motif. Further investigation revealed that IE1 and WSV056 could also bind to Drosophila retinoblastoma family protein 1 (RBF1) in a manner similar to how they bind to lv-RBL. Using the Drosophila RBF-E2F pathway as a model system, we demonstrated that both IE1 and WSV056 could sequester RBF1 from Drosophila E2F transcription factor 1 (E2F1) and subsequently activate E2F1 to stimulate the G1/S transition. Our findings provide the first evidence that WSSV may regulate cell cycle progression by targeting the Rb-E2F pathway.","Ran, Xiaozhuo; Bian, Xiaofang; Ji, Yongchang; Yan, Xiumin; Yang, Feng; Li, Fang",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.01551-13; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24027329/,840

BACKGROUND Nurses are at higher risk of suicide than the general population. The relationship between substance use, mental health and suicide in a large sample of nurses in the USA has not been previously described. DESIGN Retrospective observational quantitative analysis. METHODS Suicide data were retrospectively analysed in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Violent Death Reporting System from 2003 to 2017. Data were compared between nurses who died by suicide (n = 2,306) and non-nurses who died by suicide (n = 185,620) using odds ratios calculations and chi-square test of proportions to detect independent risk factors of suicide completion in nurses. This study followed the STROBE guidelines. RESULTS Significant differences between nurses and non-nurses were found. Among decedents for whom substances were implicated as a cause of death, nurses were far more likely to be positive at the time of death for almost all substance classifications. Both male and female nurses were more likely than non-nurses to have a mental health problem reported. Among both female and male nurses, job problems were more prevalent compared to non-nurses (12.8% and 19.9% versus 7.2% and 11.9%, respectively). Female nurses were more likely to have a physical health problem compared to female non-nurses, male nurses and male non-nurses (26.2% versus 21.3%, 22% and 20.4%). CONCLUSION Unique relationships between substance use and mental health exist among nurses who complete suicide which may offer specific opportunities for interventions to reduce suicide.

Traditional radiation protection equipment is only partially effective. The Cathpax® radiation protection cabin (RPC) has proven to significantly reduce radiation exposure in electrophysiological and neuroradiology interventions. Our objective was to analyze whether the Cathpax® RPC reduces radiation dose in coronary and cardiac structural interventions in unselected real-world procedures. METHODS AND RESULTS In this nonrandomized all-comers prospective study, 119 consecutive cardiac interventional procedures were alternatively divided into two groups: the RPC group (n = 59) and the non-RPC group (n = 60). No significant changes in the characteristics of patients and procedures, average contrast volume, air kerma (AK), dose area-product (DAP) and fluoroscopy time between both groups were apparent. In the RPC group, the first-operator relative radiation exposure was reduced by 78% at the chest and by 70% at the wrist. This effect was consistent during different types of procedures including complex percutaneous interventions and structural procedures. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrates, for the first time, that the Cathpax® cabin significantly and efficiently reduces relative operator radiation exposure during different types of interventional procedures, confirming its feasibility in a real-world setting.","Gutierrez-Barrios, Alejandro; Angulo-Pain, Esther; Noval-Morillas, Inmaculada; Cañadas-Pruaño, Dolores; de la Lastra, Inara Alarcon; Gheorghe, Livia; Zayas-Rueda, Ricardo; Calle-Perez, German; Vázquez-García, Rafael",Catheterization and cardiovascular interventions : official journal of the Society for Cardiac Angiography & Interventions,https://doi.org/10.1002/ccd.29773; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33979479/,840

To realize its full potential, borophene needs to be seamlessly interfaced with other materials, thus motivating the atomic-scale characterization of borophene-based heterostructures. Here, we report the vertical integration of borophene with tetraphenyldibenzoperiflanthene (DBP) and measure the angstrom-scale interfacial interactions with ultrahigh-vacuum tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (UHV-TERS). In addition to identifying the vibrational signatures of adsorbed DBP, TERS reveals subtle ripples and compressive strains of the borophene lattice underneath the molecular layer. The induced interfacial strain is demonstrated to extend in borophene by ∼1 nm beyond the molecular region by virtue of 5 Å chemical spatial resolution. Molecular manipulation experiments prove the molecular origins of interfacial strain in addition to allowing atomic control of local strain with magnitudes as small as ∼0.6%. In addition to being the first realization of an organic/borophene vertical heterostructure, this study demonstrates that UHV-TERS is a powerful analytical tool to spectroscopically investigate buried and highly localized interfacial characteristics at the atomic scale, which can be applied to additional classes of heterostructured materials.","Li, Linfei; Schultz, Jeremy F; Mahapatra, Sayantan; Liu, Xiaolong; Shaw, Chasen; Zhang, Xu; Hersam, Mark C; Jiang, Nan",Journal of the American Chemical Society,https://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.1c04380; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34369773/,840

METHODS Ninety-two patients with 101 pulmonary nodules underwent computed tomography (CT)-guided implantation of microcoils proximal to each nodule. Patients were randomly assigned to undergo entire microcoil or leaving-microcoil-end implantations. The complications and efficacy of the two implantation methods were evaluated. VATS resection of lung tissue containing each pulmonary lesion and microcoil were performed in the direction of the microcoil marker. Histopathological analysis was performed for the resected pulmonary lesions. RESULTS CT-guided microcoil implantation was successful in 99/101 cases, and the placement of microcoils within 1 cm of the nodules was not disruptive. There was no difference in the complications and efficacy associated with the entire implantation method (performed for 51/99 nodules) versus the leaving-microcoil-end implantation method (performed for 48/99 nodules). All nodules were successfully removed using VATS resection. Asymptomatic pneumothorax occurred in 16 patients and mild pulmonary haemorrhage occurred in nine patients. However, none of these patients required further surgical treatment. CONCLUSIONS Preoperative localization of small pulmonary nodules using a refined percutaneous microcoil implantation method was found to be safe and useful prior to VATS resection. KEY POINTS • An increasing number of small, indeterminate pulmonary lesions need to be characterized. • Entire microcoil and leaving-microcoil-end implantation methods were described for nodule localization. • Adjacent microcoil localization prior to video-assisted thoracoscopic surgical resection involved minimal intervention. • Preoperative microcoil localization facilitates the definitive resection of small pulmonary nodules.","Su, Tian-Hao; Fan, Yue-Feng; Jin, Long; He, Wen; Hu, Li-Bao",European radiology,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00330-015-3676-5; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25773939/,840

The viability changes of STWT, STCIP, and STCLI exposed to different classes of antibiotics were measured to evaluate the development of cross-resistance. The relative fitness was also estimated to evaluate the reproductive success of STWT, STCIP, and STCLI consecutively exposed to a half and 1 MIC of CEF, CIP, POL, or TET. The expression levels of efflux pump-related genes (acrA, acrB, mdsA, mdsB, mdtB, and tolC) were evaluated by using a quantitative RT-PCR assay. The MIC of CIP against STCIP was increased by 128-fold compared to STWT. STCLI was highly resistant to POL (MIC = 8 μg/ml) and TET (MIC = 256 μg/ml). STWT exposed to CIP [1/2] was susceptible to POL [1] than CEF [1], CIP [1], and TET [1], STCIP exposed to CIP [1/2] was susceptible to CEF [1] and POL [1], and STCLI exposed to CIP [1/2] was susceptible to POL [1]. STCIP was cross-resistant to CEF [1/2]-CIP [1], CIP [1/2]-CIP [1], POL [1/2]-CIP [1], and TET [1/2]-CIP (Ochoa et al., 2020) [1]. The efflux pump-related genes (acrA, acrB, mdsA, mdsB, mdtB, and tolC) were overexpressed in STWT, STCIP, and STCLI exposed to serial antibiotic treatments, which was related to the development of cross-resistance. The antibiotic susceptibility profiles of STWT, STCIP, and STCLI exposed to serial antibiotic treatments are worth understanding the evolution of antibiotic resistance and developing effective therapeutic regimens against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.","Dawan, Jirapat; Ahn, Juhee",Microbial pathogenesis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104478; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32916245/,840

A previous systematic literature review described a lack of objective evaluation for learning needs assessments in primary care physicians. This scoping review updates the literature on uses of objective evaluations to assess physicians' unperceived learning needs in CME/CPD. Identifying and understanding these approaches can inform the development of educational programs that are relevant to clinical practice and patient care. The study objectives were to (1) scope the literature since the last systematic review published in 1999; (2) conduct a comprehensive search for studies and reports that explore innovative tools and approaches to identify physicians' unperceived learning needs; (3) summarize, compare, and classify the identified approaches; and (4) map any gaps in the literature to identify future areas of research. METHODS A scoping review was used to ""map"" the literature on current knowledge regarding approaches to unperceived needs assessment using conceptual frameworks for planning and assessing CME/CPD activities. RESULTS Two prominent gaps were identified: (1) performance-based assessment strategies are highly recommended in nonresearch articles yet have low levels of implementation in published studies and (2) analysis of secondary data through patient input or environmental scanning is emphasized in grey literature implementation strategies more so than in peer-reviewed theoretical and research articles.

The list of pathogens that are recognized to have deleterious effects on fetal brain development continues to grow, most recently with the association between Zika virus (ZIKV) and microcephaly. To answer clinical questions in real time about the impact of a novel infection on developmental disabilities, an historical framework is key. The lessons learned from three historically important pathogens: rubella, cytomegalovirus, and ZIKV, and how these lessons are useful to approach emerging congenital infections are discussed in this review. Congenital infections are preventable causes of developmental disabilities and several public health approaches may be used to prevent prenatal infection. When they cannot be prevented, the sequelae of prenatal infection may be treatable.","Gordon-Lipkin, Eliza; Hoon, Alexander; Pardo, Carlos A",Developmental medicine and child neurology,https://doi.org/10.1111/dmcn.14682; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33084055/,840
136885,Synthetic or biological mesh use in laparoscopic ventral mesh rectopexy--a systematic review.,2013,"Mechanisms that control nuclear membrane remodeling are essential to maintain the integrity of the nucleus but remain to be fully defined. Here, we identify a phosphatidic acid (PA)-binding capacity in the nuclear envelope (NE)-specific ESCRT, Chm7, in budding yeast. Chm7's interaction with PA-rich membranes is mediated through a conserved hydrophobic stretch of amino acids, which confers recruitment to the NE in a manner that is independent of but required for Chm7's interaction with the LAP2-emerin-MAN1 (LEM) domain protein Heh1 (LEM2). Consistent with the functional importance of PA binding, mutation of this region abrogates recruitment of Chm7 to membranes and abolishes Chm7 function in the context of NE herniations that form during defective nuclear pore complex (NPC) biogenesis. In fact, we show that a PA sensor specifically accumulates within these NE herniations. We suggest that local control of PA metabolism is important for ensuring productive NE remodeling and that its dysregulation may contribute to pathologies associated with defective NPC assembly.","Thaller, David J; Tong, Danqing; Marklew, Christopher J; Ader, Nicholas R; Mannino, Philip J; Borah, Sapan; King, Megan C; Ciani, Barbara; Lusk, C Patrick",The Journal of cell biology,https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.202004222; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33464310/,840

This resulted in a large emotional impact on the (nursing) staff. This study aims to describe the experiences of (nursing) staff, as well as the results of serological tests on COVID-19 that have been administered to professionals. All professionals (n=281) were invited for group interviews to share their experiences concerning the COVID-19 outbreak and for a serological test for COVID-19. The 29 professionals participating in the group interviews mentioned negative and positive experiences about their fear and anxiety, the changed care for residents, the team spirit, the use of personal protective equipment and the testing policy. Out of 240 professionals who underwent the serological test and completed a questionnaire, 94 professionals (39%) had COVID-19 antibodies. In this group, 18 professionals (19%) indicated not having experienced any (physical) complaints related to COVID. Insight into the experiences of professionals resulted in essential learning points, in particular the importance of clear communication with and emotional support for staff. This study also reveals that many professionals of nursing home Mariënburght were affected by COVID-19. An important finding is the high percentage of asymptomatic employees (19% of 94 infected).

However, instead of discouraging them, these events have in many ways strengthened the resilience of the class of 2020. Additionally, COVID-19 has highlighted the importance of continued advocacy for the profession and articulation of the pharmacist's expanded role and value to the health care team, and inspired the class of 2020 to join the ranks of colleagues nationwide in raising awareness in these areas.

138081,The umbilical Benz incision for reduced port surgery in pediatric patients.,2015,"Background Various techniques are used to enhance the results of mechanical thrombectomy with stent-retrievers, including proximal arrest with balloon guide catheter (BGC), conventional large bore proximal catheter (CGC), or in combination with local aspiration through a large-bore catheter positioned at the clot interface (Aspiration-Retriever Technique for Stroke [ARTS]). We evaluated the impact of ARTS in the North American Solitaire Acute Stroke (NASA) registry. Summary Data on the use of the aspiration technique were available for 285 anterior circulation patients, of which 29 underwent ARTS technique, 131 CGC, and 125 BGC. Baseline demographics were comparable, except that ARTS patients are less likely to have hypertension or atrial fibrillation. The ARTS group had more ICA occlusions (41.4 vs. 22% in the BGC, p = 0.04 and 26% in CGC, p = 0.1) and less MCA/M1 occlusions (44.8 vs. 68% in BGC and 62% in CGC). Time from arterial puncture to reperfusion or end of procedure with ARTS was shorter than with CGC (54 vs. 91 min, p = 0.001) and was comparable to the BGC time (54 vs. 67, p = 0.11). Final degree of reperfusion was comparable among the groups (TICI [modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction] score 2b or higher was 72 vs. 70% for CGC vs. 78% for BGC). Procedural complications, mortality, and good clinical outcome at 90 days were similar between the groups. Key Messages The ARTS mechanical thrombectomy in acute ischemic stroke patients appears to yield better results as compared to the use of CGCs with no significant difference when compared to BGC. This early ARTS technique NASA registry data are limited by the earlier generation distal large bore catheters and small sample size. Future studies should focus on the comparison of ARTS and BGC techniques.","Malisch, Tim W; Zaidat, Osama O; Castonguay, Alicia C; Marden, Franklin A; Gupta, Rishi; Sun, Chung-Huan J; Martin, Coleman O; Holloway, William E; Mueller-Kronast, Nils; English, Joey; Linfante, Italo; Dabus, Guilherme; Bozorgchami, Hormozd; Xavier, Andrew; Rai, Ansaar T; Froehler, Michael; Badruddin, Aamir; Nguyen, Thanh N; Taqi, M Asif; Abraham, Michael G; Janardhan, Vallabh; Shaltoni, Hashem; Novakovic, Robin; Yoo, Albert J; Abou-Chebl, Alex; Chen, Peng Roc; Britz, Gavin W; Kaushal, Ritesh; Nanda, Ashish; Nogueira, Raul G",Interventional neurology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000480353; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29628942/,840
138120,Total Robotic Transabdominal and Transanal Total Mesorectal Excision - a video vignette.,2020-06-25,"PURPOSE Sex hormones play a role in bone density, cardiovascular health, and wellbeing throughout reproductive lifespan. Women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) have lower estrogen levels requiring hormone therapy (HT) to manage symptoms and to protect against adverse long-term health outcomes. Yet, the effectiveness of HT in preventing adverse outcomes has not been systematically assessed. We summarize the evidence regarding effects of HT on bone and cardiovascular health in women with POI. METHODS A comprehensive search of the electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Scopus was conducted by a medical reference librarian from database inception to January 2016. Randomized trials and observational cohort studies with an estrogen-based HT intervention in women with POI under the age of 40 were included. Reviewers worked independently and in duplicate to assess eligibility and risk of bias, and extract data of interest from each study. RESULTS The search identified 1670 articles; 12 met inclusion criteria. Four randomized clinical trials and eight cohort studies at high risk of bias enrolled 806 women with POI. The most common HT formulations were transdermal estradiol and oral conjugated equine estrogen combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate. Bone mineral density was the most frequent outcome, with three out of eight studies showing HT associated increase benefits. Only one study reported effects on fractures or vasomotor symptoms and none on cardiovascular mortality. Results regarding lipid profiles were inconsistent. CONCLUSIONS Evidence supporting bone and cardiovascular benefits of HT in women with POI is limited by high risk of bias, reliance on surrogate outcomes, and heterogeneity of trials regarding the formulation, dose, route of administration, and regimen of HT. Further research addressing patient important outcomes such as fractures, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality are crucial to optimize benefits of this therapy.","Burgos, Nydia; Cintron, Dahima; Latortue-Albino, Paula; Serrano, Valentina; Rodriguez Gutierrez, Rene; Faubion, Stephanie; Spencer-Bonilla, Gabriela; Erwin, Patricia J; Murad, Mohammad Hassan",Endocrine,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12020-017-1435-x; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29039146/,840

However, data acquisition and medical quality management during hospital stay still need to be improved in China. We have developed a computer-based medical data collecting system, together with automated calculation of key performance indicators (KPIs) and regular individualized education, and thus aim to explore whether it can improve the medical care quality of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) during hospital stay in stroke centers. METHODS The individualized quality improvement based on the Computer Analysing system to improve Stroke management quality Evaluation (CASE) trial is a prospective, multicenter, historical control study among 30 stroke centers in China. In this trial, the data is directly extracted from the saved original medical record of each AIS patient during hospital stay, regardless of different Electronic Medical Record System (EMRS) in each center. Then, the automated calculation of KPIs and the regular education via teleconference per month allow the clinicians to examine the causes of non-compliance of guideline-based care and develop programs to decrease their frequency. DISCUSSION We compare KPIs between pre-intervention stage and post-intervention stage (without or with education) among stroke centers. If proved effective, this approach might be generalized around China and even worldwide, where a unified EMRS is difficult to be applied and in-patient care needs to be improved.

Methods: The search strategy was developed by a librarian experienced in systematic review methodology and peer reviewed by a second research librarian. The following databases were searched from their inception to May 17, 2018: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The identified RCTs with a PEDro score of ≥6 were screened and assessed for risk of bias by two blinded individual reviewers using Covidence. Results: Seven studies were identified that had moderate-to-high methodological quality. One of the studies was identified as having a high risk of bias. Of the six studies that remained, only one study reported finding a statistically significant difference at the immediate follow-up that was not clinically significant. There was no significance at 6 and 12 months. Discussion: There is a paucity of moderate to high methodological quality RCTs with similar methodology that compare MBC to standard of care treatments for patients with LBP. Studies with moderate to high methodological quality that have a low risk of bias do not support MBCs as being superior to general exercise or GBC in the treatment of nonradicular LBP.

140321,Single-incision pediatric endosurgical epigastric hernia repair.,2014,"The aim of this review article is to provide an overview of the role of pigs as a biomedical model for humans. The usefulness and limitations of porcine models have been discussed in terms of metabolic, cardiovascular, digestive and bone diseases in humans. Domestic pigs and minipigs are the main categories of pigs used as biomedical models. One drawback of minipigs is that they are in short supply and expensive compared with domestic pigs, which in contrast cost more to house, feed and medicate. Different porcine breeds show different responses to the induction of specific diseases. For example, ossabaw minipigs provide a better model than Yucatan for the metabolic syndrome as they exhibit obesity, insulin resistance and hypertension, all of which are absent in the Yucatan. Similar metabolic/physiological differences exist between domestic breeds (e.g. Meishan v. Pietrain). The modern commercial (e.g. Large White) domestic pig has been the preferred model for developmental programming due to the 2- to 3-fold variation in body weight among littermates providing a natural form of foetal growth retardation not observed in ancient (e.g. Meishan) domestic breeds. Pigs have been increasingly used to study chronic ischaemia, therapeutic angiogenesis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and abdominal aortic aneurysm as their coronary anatomy and physiology are similar to humans. Type 1 and II diabetes can be induced in swine using dietary regimes and/or administration of streptozotocin. Pigs are a good and extensively used model for specific nutritional studies as their protein and lipid metabolism is comparable with humans, although pigs are not as sensitive to protein restriction as rodents. Neonatal and weanling pigs have been used to examine the pathophysiology and prevention/treatment of microbial-associated diseases and immune system disorders. A porcine model mimicking various degrees of prematurity in infants receiving total parenteral nutrition has been established to investigate gut development, amino acid metabolism and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Endoscopic therapeutic methods for upper gastrointestinal tract bleeding are being developed. Bone remodelling cycle in pigs is histologically more similar to humans than that of rats or mice, and is used to examine the relationship between menopause and osteoporosis. Work has also been conducted on dental implants in pigs to consider loading; however with caution as porcine bone remodels slightly faster than human bone. We conclude that pigs are a valuable translational model to bridge the gap between classical rodent models and humans in developing new therapies to aid human health.","Litten-Brown, J C; Corson, A M; Clarke, L",Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience,https://doi.org/10.1017/s1751731110000200; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22444262/,840

Cancer is usually diagnosed at an advanced stage with a 5-year survival rate of 15%. Most of these patients present de novo and are not part of a surveillance program. Endoscopic screening with improvement in recognition of early lesions may change this pattern. In the past, patients diagnosed with dysplasia and mucosal cancer were best managed by esophagectomy. Endoscopic techniques such as endoscopic mucosal resection and radiofrequency ablation have resulted in high curative rates and a shift away from esophagectomy. This pathway is supported by the literature review of esophagectomies performed for mucosal disease, as well as pathologists' interpretation of endoscopic mucosal specimens, which document the low risk of lymph node metastasis.

Open appendectomy is still the treatment often chosen because it is simple, safe, and effective. Our aim was to study whether cosmetic results of appendectomy wounds are better after using continuous absorbable intradermal (A) sutures compared with wound closure with interrupted nonabsorbable (NA) sutures. METHODS A total of 206 adult patients with clinically suspected appendicitis were allocated to the study and prospectively randomized into two wound-closure groups: the interrupted NA suture group and the A suture group. Of these, 193 patients with sufficient data were invited to the outpatient clinic for cosmetic analysis. Cosmetic results were evaluated after a median of 14 months. For subjective scar assessment, the Vancouver scar scale, the patient and observer scar assessment scale (POSAS), and a visual analog scale (VAS) were used. Objective evaluation was carried out by measuring surface area, average width, and estimated concentration change (ECC) of hemoglobin and melanin in the scar using spectrocutometry. For statistical analyses we used the Mann-Whitney test and Student's t test. RESULTS Both objective and subjective analyses showed better cosmetic results for absorbable intradermal suturing. The difference between the two groups was statistically significant as regards POSAS in both patient (p = 0.032) and observer scales (p = 0.001), and VAS (p = 0.002). Scar surface area was significantly smaller in group A than in group NA (p = 0.002). ECC measurements showed higher values for melanin in group NA than in group A (p = 0.034).

Design: The characteristic, profound pro-inflammatory, hypercoagulable state of COVID-19 is manifested by the high severity of illness and extensive organ dysfunction observed in these patients. SF in critically ill patients, although described previously, exhibits a uniquely complex pathogenesis in this population. Patients: Retrospective review of all COVID-19 patients (confirmed positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 [SARS-CoV-2]) admitted to a single surgical ICU for at least 48 hours between March-June 2020. Interventions: Data were extracted from a COVID-19 institutional data repository that harvested data from electronic health records and other clinical data sources. Demographics; coagulation/inflammation biomarkers; number, location, and stage of SF lesions; resource utilization; and outcomes were captured. Measurements and Main Results: 64 patients met inclusion criteria; 51 (80%) developed SF (SF+ ). Forty-three (85%) developed stage 3 or higher SF (χ2 = 22.66, P < .0001). Thirty-nine of 51 (76%) SF+ patients developed more than one SF lesion (χ2 = 13.26, P = .0003). SF+ patients manifested a profound pro-inflammatory, hypercoagulable phenotype (lower serum albumin and higher ferritin, interleukin [IL]-6 and D-dimer concentrations [all, P < .001]). Durations of mechanical ventilation, vasopressor therapy, and ICU length of stay were significantly longer (all, P < .05) in the SF + patients. Conclusions: The unique characteristics of COVID-19 dermatopathology and the strong correlation between markers of inflammation and development of SF reflect COVID-19-related organ dysfunction and its deleterious effects on the microcirculation. Considering that skin is invaded directly by SARS-CoV-2 and affected by COVID-19-related immune complex deposition and microthrombosis, SF may reflect disease as opposed to pressure injuries related to processes of care.

These include a desirable combination of cutting and photoangiolytic qualities and a lightweight, shock-resistant design. Despite its increasing use, current evidence is limited to experimental data and case reports. OBJECTIVES The authors present a case series and overview of office blue laser transnasal flexible laser surgery (TNFLS), considering indications, patient selection, safety, technique, and surgical outcomes. We also review the safety and relevance of TNFLS to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. METHODS Retrospective case series and narrative review. Our primary outcome measure was preoperative and postoperative Voice Handicap Index (VHI-10) score. Complications were documented by nature and severity. RESULTS Thirty-six cases of office blue laser TNFLS were performed. A statistically significant improvement in VHI-10 score was demonstrated in cases of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) and benign laryngeal lesions causing dysphonia (P < 0.01 and 0.045). Blue laser also proved effective in assisting office biopsy procedures. A minor and self-limiting complication was reported. CONCLUSIONS Office blue laser TNFLS is safe and effective in the treatment of RRP and a range of benign laryngeal lesions. Future research should compare the efficacy and safety of blue laser with potassium titanyl phosphate laser in office-based treatment of these conditions.

145665,Novel biological strategies in the management of anal fistula.,2012,"INTRODUCTION Telemedicine is the delivery of healthcare from a remote location using integrated computer/communication technology. The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased adoption of telemedicine with national orthopaedic governing bodies advocating its use, as evidence suggests that social distancing maybe necessary until 2022. This systematic review aims to explore evidence for telemedicine in orthopaedics to determine its advantages, validity, effectiveness and utilisation. METHODS Databases of PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus and CINHAL were systematically searched and articles were included if they involved any form of telephone or video consultation in an orthopaedic population. Findings were synthesised into four themes: patient/clinician satisfaction, accuracy and validity of examination, safety and patient outcomes and cost effectiveness. Quality assessment was undertaken using Cochrane and Joanna Briggs Institute appraisal tools. RESULTS Twenty-one studies were included consisting of nine randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Studies revealed high patient satisfaction with telemedicine for convenience, less waiting and travelling time. Telemedicine was cost effective particularly if patients had to travel long distances, required hospital transport or time off work. No clinically significant differences were found in patient examination nor measurement of patient-reported outcome measures. Telemedicine was reported to be a safe method of consultation. DISCUSSION Evidence suggests that telemedicine in orthopaedics can be safe, cost effective, valid in clinical assessment and with high patient/clinician satisfaction. However, more high-quality RCTs are required to elucidate long-term outcomes. This systematic review presents up-to-date evidence on the use of telemedicine and provides data for organisations considering its use in the current COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.","Haider, Zakir; Aweid, Bashaar; Subramanian, Padmanabhan; Iranpour, Farhad",Journal of telemedicine and telecare,https://doi.org/10.1177/1357633x20938241; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32762270/,840

This systematic review was conducted to analyze the currently documented evidence regarding the association between ultra-processed food with overweight and obesity. METHODS A literature search was performed using multiple literature databases for relevant articles published prior to November 2019. Random effects model, namely the DerSimonian-Laird method, was applied to pool effect sizes. The potential sources of heterogeneity across studies were explored using the Cochrane Q test. RESULTS Fourteen studies (one cohort study and thirteen cross-sectional studies) were included in this review. A significant association was identified between ultra-processed food intake and overweight (pooled effect size: 1.02; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.01, 1.03, p < 0.001) and obesity (pooled effect size: 1.26; 95% CI: 1.13, 1.41, p < 0.001).

150298,Transanal total mesorectal excision with a side-to-end stapled anastomosis - a video vignette.,2014,"There is growing interest in far-UVC lighting, defined as wavelengths from 200 to 230 nm, because research has demonstrated these wavelengths to be an effective antimicrobial technology while posing a minimal hazard to human health. Far-UVC lighting is now being installed to directly irradiate spaces where humans are present, and it will be important to perform measurements to verify far-UVC lighting installations are operating within widely accepted exposure guidelines. In this work we explore the use of a commercially available film, known as OrthoChromic OC-1, to measure ultraviolet radiation exposure. The film was tested with a variety of ultraviolet wavelengths and irradiance conditions, and the color change of the film was analyzed for increasing levels of radiant exposure. The film response extended over a dynamic range that was greater than the recommended exposure limits for far-UVC radiation so it can potentially be useful for health hazard monitoring. The spectrum of the incident ultraviolet radiation strongly affected the response of the film, therefore for accurate measurements we recommend the measured spectrum match the spectrum used for calibration. Overall, dosimetry with this film provides a simple, accurate, and inexpensive method of quantifying ultraviolet radiation exposure that is suitable for far-UVC measurements.","Welch, David; Brenner, David J",Photochemistry and photobiology,https://doi.org/10.1111/php.13364; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33294996/,840

They are the reservoir of a number of human zoonotic diseases including Nipah, Ebola, and severe acute respiratory syndrome. We report the identification of novel groups of astroviruses in apparently healthy insectivorous bats found in Hong Kong, in particular, bats belonging to the genera Miniopterus and Myotis. Astroviruses are important causes of diarrhea in many animal species, including humans. Many of the bat astroviruses form distinct phylogenetic clusters in the genus Mamastrovirus within the family Astroviridae. Virus detection rates of 36% to 100% and 50% to 70% were found in Miniopterus magnater and Miniopterus pusillus bats, respectively, captured within a single bat habitat during four consecutive visits spanning 1 year. There was high genetic diversity of viruses in bats found within this single habitat. Some bat astroviruses may be phylogenetically related to human astroviruses, and further studies with a wider range of bat species in different geographic locations are warranted. These findings are likely to provide new insights into the ecology and evolution of astroviruses and reinforce the role of bats as a reservoir of viruses with potential to pose a zoonotic threat to human health.","Chu, D K W; Poon, L L M; Guan, Y; Peiris, J S M",Journal of virology,https://doi.org/10.1128/jvi.00857-08; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18550669/,840

Frequently, clinicians encounter difficulties in diagnosing the disease because of its often unspecific clinical and radiological presentation. We report three cases of sudden unexpected death in infancy (SUDI), involving two males and one female admitted to hospital due to mild respiratory distress. In all three cases, complete post-mortem investigations were successful in uncovering interstitial lung disease as the cause of death. These cases highlight the key role of infection-related interstitial lung diseases in the pathogenesis of some currently unexplained SUDI/SIDS and the diagnostic difficulties due to the variable clinical and histological pattern, thereby explaining the importance of performing complete post-mortem investigations whenever an infant dies suddenly and unexpectedly.","Pignotti, Maria S; Maiese, Aniello; Ugolini, Sara; Iannaccone, Francesca; Santoro, Paola; Neri, Margherita; Turillazzi, Emanuela; Paolo, Marco Di",The Medico-legal journal,https://doi.org/10.1177/00258172211009071; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34219536/,840
152242,Performance of Residents During Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy: Is Self-assessment Reliable?,2021-05-24,"OBJECTIVE Lately single-port surgery is becoming a widespread procedure, but it is more difficult than conventional laparoscopy owing to the lack of triangulation. Although, these operations are also possible with standard laparoscopic instruments, curved instruments are being developed. The aims of the study were to identify the effect of training on a box trainer in single-port setting on the quality of acquired skills, and transferred with the straight and curved instruments for the basic laparoscopic tasks, and highlight the importance of a special laparoscopic training curriculum. DESIGN A prospective study on a box trainer in single-port setting was conducted using 2 groups. Each group performed 2 tasks on the box trainer in single-port setting. Group-S used conventional straight laparoscopic instruments, and Group-C used curved laparoscopic instruments. Learning curves were obtained by daily measurements recorded in 7-day sessions. On the last day, the 2 groups changed instruments between each other. SETTING 1st Department of Surgery, Semmelweis University of Medicine from Budapest, Hungary, a university teaching hospital. PARTICIPANTS In all, 20 fifth-year medical students were randomized into 2 groups. None of them had any laparoscopic or endoscopic experience. Participation was voluntary. RESULTS Although Group-S performed all tasks significantly faster than Group-C on the first day, the difference proved to be nonsignificant on the last day. All participants achieved significantly shorter task completion time on the last day than on the first day, regardless of the instrument they used. Group-S showed improvement of 63.5%, and Group-C 69.0% improvement by the end of the session. After swapping the instruments, Group-S reached significantly higher task completion time with curved instruments, whereas Group-C showed further progression of 8.9% with straight instruments. CONCLUSIONS Training with curved instruments in a single-port setting allows for a better acquisition of skills in a shorter period. For this reason, there is a need for proficiency-based conventional, but also for a single-port, laparoscopic training curriculum in general surgery residency education.","Lukovich, Peter; Sionov, Valery Ben; Kakucs, Timea",Journal of surgical education,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsurg.2015.10.013; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26868318/,840
152754,Ventralight ST and SorbaFix versus Physiomesh and Securestrap in a porcine model.,2013,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE Indirect consequences of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic include those related to failure of patients to seek or receive timely medical attention for seemingly unrelated disease. We report our experience with stroke code imaging during the early pandemic months of 2020. MATERIALS AND METHODS Retrospective review of stroke codes during the 2020 pandemic and both 2020 and matched 2019 prepandemic months was performed. Patient variables were age, sex, hospital location, and severity of symptoms based on the NIHSS. We reviewed the results of CT of the head, CTA, CTP, and MR imaging examinations and classified a case as imaging-positive if any of the imaging studies yielded a result that related to the clinical indication for the study. Both year-to-year and sequential comparisons were performed between pandemic and prepandemic months. RESULTS A statistically significant decrease was observed in monthly stroke code volumes accompanied by a statistically significant increased proportion of positive imaging findings during the pandemic compared with the same months in the prior year (P < .001) and prepandemic months in the same year (P < .001). We also observed statistically significant increases in average NIHSS scores (P = .045 and P = .03) and the proportion of inpatient stroke codes (P = .003 and P = .03). CONCLUSIONS During our pandemic period, there was a significantly decreased number of stroke codes but simultaneous increases in positivity rates, symptom severity, and inpatient codes. We postulate that this finding reflects the documented reluctance of patients to seek medical care during the pandemic, with the shift toward a greater proportion of inpatient stroke codes potentially reflecting the neurologic complications of the virus itself.","Shatzkes, D R; Zlochower, A B; Steinklein, J M; Pramanik, B K; Filippi, C G; Azhar, S; Wang, J J; Sanelli, P C",AJNR.

154314,Report of the President of the AECP.,2021-05-01,"BACKGROUND It is challenging for anesthetists to determine the optimal tracheal intubation depth in children. We hypothesize that a measure three times the length of the middle finger can be used for predicting tracheal tube depth in children. METHODS Eighty-six children (4-14 years of age) were included in this study. After the children were anesthetized, a fiberoptic bronchoscope (FOB) was inserted into the trachea, the lengths from the upper incisor teeth to carina and vocal cords were measured, and a suitably sized cuffed tracheal tube was inserted into the trachea. Age-based and middle finger length-based formulas were used to determine the tracheal intubation depth. RESULTS All 86 children enrolled were included in this study. Compared with the age-based intubation, the rate of appropriate tube placement was higher for middle finger length-based intubation (88.37% vs 66.28%, P = 0.001). The proximal intubation rate was lower in middle finger length-based intubation (4.65% vs 32.56%, P < 0.001). There was only weak evidence for a difference in the distal intubation rate between the two methods (6.97% vs 1.16%, P = 0.054). The correlation coefficient between middle finger length and optimal tracheal tube depth was larger than that between age and optimal tracheal tube depth (0.883 vs 0.845). CONCLUSIONS Our data indicate that the appropriate tube placement rate can be improved by using three times the middle finger length as the tracheal intubation depth in children.","Zhou, Qing-he; Xiao, Wang-pin; Zhou, Hong-mei",Paediatric anaesthesia,https://doi.org/10.1111/pan.12730; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26239261/,840
154507,Single incision laparoscopic sigmoid colon resections without visible scar: a novel technique.,2010,"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Portal clamping during liver resection decreases intraoperative blood loss, but causes ischemic-reperfusion (I-R) injury. Intermittent portal clamping (IPC) and ischemic preconditioning (IP) decreased I-R injury in animal models. Most of the human studies about IP excluded cirrhotic patients, whose liver is more vulnerable to I-R injury. The effect of IP and IPC during extended liver resection was investigated in this randomized controlled trial, with special respect to cirrhotic patients. METHODS One hundred sixty patients (100 normal liver, 60 cirrhotic) undergoing major liver resection were randomized to receive IPC (15 min ischemia, 5 min reperfusion), or IP (10 min ischemia, 10 min reperfusion). Serum oxygen-derived free radicals (ODFR) and antioxidant concentrations (preoperative, after reperfusion and 7th postoperative day), such as ""conventional"" liver tests (preoperative, 1st, 3rd, and 7th postoperative day) were measured. RESULTS IP resulted in significantly lower peak ODFR, AST, ALT, and bilirubin levels after liver resection than IPC (P < 0.05). The level of serum antioxidants after reperfusion was significantly higher in IP than in IPC groups (P < 0.05). In cirrhotic patients without IP none of these values normalized until the 7th postoperative day. CONCLUSIONS Ischemic preconditioning--especially in patients with liver cirrhosis--is a suitable method to decrease the I-R injury of the liver.","Hahn, Oszkár; Blázovics, Anna; Váli, László; Kupcsulik, Peter K",Journal of surgical oncology,https://doi.org/10.1002/jso.21907; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21744346/,840

Patients with CAP were consecutively enrolled in the ED of an urban university hospital. sTM, PCT, and CRP levels were measured on enrollment. In addition, the PSI and CURB65 scores were calculated. For all patients, a 30-day follow-up was performed. A total of 573 patients with CAP were enrolled in this study. sTM, PCT, and CRP levels increased with the aggravation of the disease severity as assessed by the PSI and CURB65 score (all P <0.01). The multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that sTM and the PSI were independent predictors of 30-day mortality, and the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the accuracy of sTM in the prediction of 30-day mortality was comparable with the PSI (P >0.05) and better than PCT, CRP, and the CURB65 score (P all <0.05). Furthermore, a combination of sTM and scoring systems can enhance the predictive accuracy of 30-day mortality. sTM is useful in the evaluation of the severity and outcome of CAP in the ED. A well-designed, multi-center study will be needed to further investigate the value of sTM in CAP.","Yin, Qin; Liu, Bo; Chen, Yunxia; Zhao, Yunzhou; Li, Chunsheng",Inflammation,https://doi.org/10.1007/s10753-014-9854-9; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24573987/,840

Long-term outcome of a randomized controlled trial.,2017,"BACKGROUND: Cool and dry gas insufflation during laparoscopy induces hypothermia and cytokine increase, with significant perioperative morbidity. Our aim was to assess if warmed and humidified CO2 insufflation with HumiGard™ device can achieve significant benefits over standard insufflation in terms of risk of hypothermia, cytokine response, blood gases, and intra- and postoperative parameters, in the setting of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP). METHODS: This was a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial. Sixty-four patients with prostate cancer undergoing RARP were randomized to receive warmed and humidified CO2 insufflation with HumiGard device, plus hot air warming blanket (treatment group, H + WB), or standard CO2 insufflation, plus hot air warming blanket (control group, WB). Body core temperature (BCT), plasma levels of IL-6 and TNF-α, pain scores, and intraoperative parameters were recorded. The data were analyzed according to the Bayesian paradigm. RESULTS: Intraoperative BCT increased in both groups during surgery, with a statistically significant difference favoring group H + WB, ending at 0.2°C higher on average than group WB. No difference across groups was shown for cytokine levels. Blood gas parameters were not affected by warmed CO2 insufflation. No statistical differences were noted for pain scores and the other intra- and postoperative parameters. CONCLUSIONS: During RARP, warm and humidified CO2 insufflation with the HumiGard device was more effective than the standard CO2 insufflation in maintaining the patient's heat homeostasis, even if the difference was minimal. No imbalances were detected on blood gas analyses. No benefit could be shown in terms of cytokine levels and pain scores.","Oderda, Marco; Cerutti, Elisabetta; Gontero, Paolo; Manetta, Tilde; Mengozzi, Giulio; Meyer, Nicolas; Munegato, Stefania; Noll, Eric; Rampa, Paola; Piéchaud, Thierry; Diemunsch, Pierre",Urologia,https://doi.org/10.1177/0391560319834837; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30868938/,840

The study reacted rapidly to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, deploying an online questionnaire early on during lockdown (from 9 th April to 15 th May). In late May 2020, a second questionnaire was developed asking about physical and mental health, lifestyle and behaviours, employment and finances. The online questionnaire was deployed across the parent and offspring generations between the 26th May and 5 th July 2020. 6482 participants completed the questionnaire (2639 original mothers, 1039 original fathers/partners, 2711 offspring (mean age ~28 years) and 93 partners of offspring). 1039 new participants who did not respond to the first questionnaire deployed in April completed the second questionnaire. A positive COVID-19 test was reported by 36 (0.6%) participants (12 G0 and 24 G1), 91 (1.4%; 35 G0 and 56 G1) reported that they had been told by a doctor they likely had COVID-19 and 838 (13%; 422 G0 and 416 G1) suspected that they have had COVID-19. The observational data from both COVID questionnaires will be complemented with linkage to health records and results of biological testing as they become available. In combination, these data may help us identify true cases. Data has been released as an update to the original dataset released in May 2020. It comprises: 1) a standard dataset containing all participant responses to both questionnaires with key sociodemographic factors and 2) as a composite release coordinating data from the existing resource, thus enabling bespoke research across all areas supported by the study.

The potential to improve clinical outcomes in patients with DM and cardiovascular (CV disease have been augmented by evidence from CV outcome trials of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2) and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1) demonstrating significant reduction in major adverse CV events (MACE) and with SGLT2i, significantly reduction in HFrelated hospitalization. (3) Given this evidence there is a need for specialist clinicians to assist in overcoming clinical inertia in their implementation to improve patient care and prognosis. (3) Purpose To review the initial activity and clinical interventions resulting from an innovative cardiometabolic clinic (CMC) service within an NHS tertiary cardiac centre, incorporating a consultant diabetologist and cardiologist, in which patients' concomitant CV and metabolic risk are addressed simultaneously. Methods Patient data (biochemistry, radiology results and observations including weight, symptoms, blood pressure, blood glucose) and clinic activity (consultation notes and GP correspondence) were reviewed retrospectively over a 6 month period from 29/09/2020 to 29/03/2021. Results A total of 144 patients have been referred to CMC, of which 64 were seen during the study period, 6 did not attend, and 74 await an appointment. Of the 64 seen, 13 have been discharged back to the referrer and/or to a more appropriate clinician. Referrals to other specialists have been made for 26 patients to augment their care.Initiation of SGLT2 and GLP-1 was recommended for 31 and 9 patients, respectively. Up-titration of existing SGLT2i and GLP-1 was carried out for two patients already on each of these agents. Additionally, 28 other medications were initiated or optimised (5 diuretics, 3 antihypertensives, 3 lipid-lowering therapies, 2 beta blockers, 1 angiotensin-receptor blocker, 1 anticoagulant, 2 orlistat, 8 metformin and 3 other anti-diabetics). Medications for 12 patients were stopped due to contraindication, intolerance or to permit introduction of evidence- based therapy.Each consultation has also included discussion of lifestyle interventions as per latest ESC guidelines. Among the 32 patients in whom antidiabetic drugs (including SGLT2, GLP-1) have been initiated or titrated, one available marker of clinical effect associated with these interventions has been glycaemic control as quantified by HbA1c. Reduction in HbA1c has been observed in 11 patients (mean reduction 17.7 mmol/mol), while 3 have noted an increase (mean 4.7 mmol/mol, and results are pending for 18 patients.Collection of outcomes including hospitalisations for HF, CV events, ejection fraction, and adverse effects of treatment is ongoing.The above has been achieved despite limitations imposed by the remote nature of the clinic due to the Covid-19 pandemic, which limits performance of blood tests, echocardiograms and observations. This limitation is expected to be ameliorated by conducting in-person clinics in future. Conclusions Operation of a joint CMC facilitates optimisation of the pharmacological management of risk factors in patients with cardiac and metabolic disease, particularly incorporation of current evidence-based therapies. Emerging outcomes indicate the potential impact of this service on patients' long term CV outcomes.","Bijman, L.; Narain, R.; Chen, M.; Joshi, H.",Heart,https://doi.org/10.1136/heartjnl-2021-bcs.193,840

Transoral fine needle aspiration cytology offers a low-risk means of rapidly diagnosing patients with oral cavity or oropharyngeal lesions. The technique was utilised in selected patients at our institution during the pandemic. The outcomes are considered in this study. METHOD: Diagnostic outcomes were retrospectively evaluated for a series of patients undergoing transoral fine needle aspiration cytology of oral cavity and oropharyngeal lesions during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Five patients underwent transoral fine needle aspiration cytology, yielding lesional material in 100 per cent, with cell blocks providing additional information. In one case, excision biopsy of a lymphoproliferative lesion was required for final diagnosis. CONCLUSION: Transoral fine needle aspiration cytology can provide rapid diagnosis in patients with oral cavity and oropharyngeal lesions. Whilst limitations exist (including tolerability and lesion location), the technique offers significant advantages pertinent to the COVID-19 era, and could be employed in the future to obviate diagnostic surgery in selected patients.","Touska, P; Oikonomou, G; Ngu, R; Chandra, A; Malhotra, A; Fry, A; Oakley, R; Arora, A; Jeannon, J-P; Simo, R",The Journal of laryngology and otology,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0022215120001929; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32873344/,840
