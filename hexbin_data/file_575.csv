2751,2751,2751,Risk factors for pulmonary complications after hepatic resection: role of intraoperative hemodynamic instability and hepatic ischemia,16.57549,8.9948635,2017-06-20,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative operative pulmonary complications (PPCs) after hepatic surgery are associated with increased length of hospital stays. Intraoperative blood transfusion, extensive resection and different comorbidities have been identified. Other parameters, like time of hepatic ischemia, have neither been clinically studied, though experimental studies show that hepatic ischemia can provide lung injury. The objective of this study was to determinate the risk factors of postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) after hepatic resection within 7 postoperative days. METHOD: Ninety-four patients consecutively who underwent elective hepatectomy between January and December 2013. Demographic data, pathological variables, and preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative variables had been prospectively collected in a data base. The dependant variables studied were the occurrence of PPCs, defined before analysis of the data. RESULTS: PPCs occurred in 32 (34%) patients. A multivariate analysis allowed identifying the risk factors for PPCs. On multivariate analysis, preoperative gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) elevation OR =5,12 [1,85-15,69] p = 0,002, liver ischemia duration OR = 1,03 [1,01-1,06] p = 0,01 and the intraoperative use of vasopressor OR = 4,40 [1,58-13,36] p = 0,006 were independently associated with PPCs. For every 10 min added in ischemia duration, the OR of the risk of PPCs was estimated to be 1.37 (CI(95%) = [1.08-1.81], p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Three risk factors for PPCs have been identified in a population undergoing liver resection: preoperative GGT elevation, ischemia duration and the intraoperative use of vasopressor. PPCs after liver surgery could be related to lung injury induced by liver ischemia reperfusion and not solely by direct infectious process. That could explain why factors influencing directly or indirectly liver ischemia were independently associated with PPCs.

Current findings exist that accentuate the role of the time factor, comparable with acute myocardial infarction or with ischemic stroke. On the other hand, there are no generally accepted diagnostics for sepsis, realizing the demands of early diagnosis and based on the physician’s experience. The diagnostics start with the recognition of the inflammatory reaction caused by infection (at least 2 of 4 criteria of inflammatory reaction have to be fulfilled). This definition has high sensitivity, but remarkably lower specificity and it leads either to too frequent admissions or only to hospitalization in case of a complicating organ failure. Making a careful history and knowledge about sepsis are essential for the out-patient department physicians. In addition to the varying pictures of sepsis, the clinicians have laboratory findings available, most of all procalcitonin. Patients have to be considered as septic with a serum PCT level higher than 1 ng/ml particularly when clinical signs do not exclude sepsis and in cases of positive blood cultures. Initially PCT is a product of macrophages if the defense reaction starts, but it becomes an infection marker, when the serum PCT level declines less than the half life falls.","Engelmann, L.",Intensivmed Notfallmed,575,9

Tracheostomy is a common procedure with some risks, on the other hand with potential advantages over orotracheal intubation in critically ill patients. This study investigated the association of tracheostomy with health-related quality of life (HRQoL), symptoms of psychiatric disorders and return-to-work of ARDS survivors. METHODS: Data were collected in the context of the prospective observational German-wide DACAPO study. Clinical and demographic patient data and treatment characteristics were obtained from the participating intensive care units (ICU). HRQoL and return-to-work were assessed using patient-reported questionnaires 3, 6 and 12 months after ICU discharge. HRQoL was measured with the Physical and Mental Component Scale of the Short-Form 12 Questionnaire (PCS-12, MCS-12). The prevalence of psychiatric symptoms (depression and post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) was assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and the Post-Traumatic Stress Syndrome-14. Physician-diagnosed anxiety and obsessive–compulsive disorder were recorded by patient self-report in the follow-up questionnaires. The associations of tracheostomy with HRQoL, psychiatric symptoms and return-to-work after 12 months were investigated by means of multivariable linear and logistic regression models. RESULTS: Primary 877 ARDS patients (mean ± standard deviation: 54 ± 16 years, 68% male) survived and were discharged from ICU. Out of these patients, 478 (54.5%) were tracheotomised during ICU treatment. After 12 months, patient-reported outcomes could be analysed of 388 (44.2%) respondents, 205 with tracheostomy and 183 without. One year after ICU discharge, tracheostomy showed no significant association with physical or mental health-related quality of life (PCS-12: − 0.73 [− 3.96, 2.51]; MCS-12: − 0.71 [− 4.92, 3.49]), symptoms of psychiatric disorders (depression: 0.10 [− 1.43, 1.64]; PTSD: 3.31 [− 1.81, 8.43]; anxiety: 1.26 [0.41, 3.86]; obsessive–compulsive disorder: 0.59 [0.05, 6.68]) or return-to-work (0.71 [0.31, 1.64]) in the multivariable analysis (OR [95%-CI]). CONCLUSIONS: Up to 1 year after ICU discharge, neither HRQoL nor symptoms of psychiatric disorders nor return-to-work was affected by tracheostomy.

The lack of availability of these expensive and non-portable devices in resource-deficient settings is a significant deterrent in their widespread utilization for proper post-operative management. The rapidly evolving utilization of smartphone photography has significantly benefited diagnostics of posterior segment disorders and is now being increasingly utilized for monitoring anterior segment pathologies as well as post-surgical course. In this study, we study a novel use of smartphones for bleb photography for assessing the morphological characteristics as vascularity and microcysts. METHODS: In this pilot, observational study, we compared the trabeculectomy bleb images of five subjects, obtained by iPhone X (dual lens) and iPhone 6S (single lens). We captured two image sets with both smartphones first with a focussed torchlight and then with a built-in flash video light. RESULTS: The images resulting from the newer iPhone X were substantially superior than those from iPhone 6S. For the 12-megapixel dual-camera set-up on the iPhone X, the 1 × lens resulted in better images than the 2 × lens with contrast and overall clarity of the area of interest. While the macro-lens attachment had promising results at 1 × zoom, there is no added advantage of the macro-lens attachment as it resulted in considerable loss of image quality at twice the zoom. Using a 20 D lens helped attain higher magnification and better framing as it reduced the focussing distance needed to get sharp images. The images obtained from both smartphones were of higher quality when illuminated from an external source when compared to the native iPhone flash due to even exposure and fewer autofocus artefacts. CONCLUSION: Analyses of all image sets showed that the current generation in-built camera app on IOS and newer iPhone camera optics resulted in high-quality images of the ocular surface with high magnification without any loss in clarity.

A total of 305 Filipinos answered the online questionnaire, which contained 38 questions. The results of SEM indicated that subjective appetite (SA) was found to have a significant direct effect on menu options (MO). Consequently, MO was found to have significant direct effects on imagery elaboration (IE), vividness (VV), and convenience (CO), and an indirect effect on order accuracy (OA). Finally, SA, MO, IE, VV, OA, and CO were found to have significant effects on satisfaction (S), which subsequently led to loyalty (L) and repurchase intention (RI). Interestingly, MO was found to have the highest indirect effect on RI, indicating that MO is an important consideration for RI. This is the first comprehensive study evaluating drive-through fast food in the Philippines.

However, the traditional DGP lacks consideration for multi-view cases in which data may come from different sources or be constructed by different types of features. In this paper, we propose a generalized multi-view DGP (MvDGP) to capture the characteristics of different views and model data in different views discriminately. In order to make the proposed model more efficient in training, we introduce a pre-training network in MvDGP and incorporate stochastic variational inference for fine-tuning. Experimental results on real-world data sets demonstrate that pre-trained MvDGP outperforms the state-of-the-art DGP models and deep neural networks, achieving higher computational efficiency than other DGP models.","Zhu, Han; Zhao, Jing; Sun, Shiliang",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,575,1

Understanding the natural history of CVD in Haitians, including the age of onset, prevalence, incidence, and role of major risk factors and social determinants, is urgently needed to develop prevention and treatment interventions. Aim 1: Establish a population-based cohort of 3000 adults from Port-au-Prince and assess the prevalence of CVD risk factors and diseases and their association with social and environmental determinants. Aim 2: Determine the incidence of CVD risk factors and CVD during 2–3.5 years of follow-up and their association with social and environmental determinants. METHODS: The Haiti CVD Cohort is a longitudinal observational study of 3000 adults > 18 years in Port-au-Prince (PAP), Haiti. The study population is recruited using multistage random sampling from census blocks. Adults receive blood pressure (BP) measurements in the community and those with elevated BP are referred to the Groupe Haitien d’Etude Sarcome de Kaposi et des Infections Opportunistes Clinic for care. After informed consent, participants undergo a clinical exam with medical history. BP, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, a study questionnaire on health behaviors, and laboratory specimens. Every 6 months, BP is remeasured. At 12 and 24 months, clinical exams and questionnaires are repeated. Labs are repeated at 24 months. Adjudicated study outcomes include the prevalence and incidence of CVD risk factors (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, dyslipidemia, kidney disease, inflammation, poor diet, smoking, and physical inactivity) and events (myocardial infarction, heart failure, stroke, and CVD mortality). We also measure social determinants including poverty. Depression, stress, social isolation, food insecurity, and lead exposure. Blood, urine, and stool samples are biobanked at study enrollment. DISCUSSION: The Haiti CVD Cohort is the largest population-based cohort study evaluating CVD risk factors and CVD among adults in urban Haiti with the goal of understanding the drivers of the CVD epidemic in Haiti. Study outcomes are comparable with existing international cohorts, and the biobank will provide important data for future research. Our goal is to translate findings from this study into pragmatic prevention and treatment interventions to fight the CVD epidemic in Haiti.","Lookens, Jean; Tymejczyk, Olga; Rouzier, Vanessa; Smith, Caleigh; Preval, Fabyola; Joseph, Inddy; Baptiste, Raynold Jean; Victor, Joscar; Severe, Patrice; Apollon, Sandra; Dumont, Emelyne; Forestal, Guyrlaine; St. Preux, Stephano; Rivera, Vanessa; Seo, Grace; Charles, Benedict; Ariste, Wilson; Kingery, Justin; Devieux, Jessy; Koenig, Serena; Nash, Denis; Fitzgerald, Daniel; Safford, Monika; Deschamps, Marie Marcelle; Pape, Jean; McNairy, Margaret",BMC Public Health,575,8

Previous studies confirmed that prophylactic corticosteroids play an important role in reducing the risk of PES and extubation failure. However, few studies have looked at the efficacy of corticosteroids on preventing PES in patients after an emergency intubation. AIM: To evaluate whether a single dose of methylprednisolone given over a set timeframe before extubation is effective in preventing PES in patients after an emergency intubation. METHODS: A multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial will be performed in an emergency department (ED) setting. The trial will include 132 patients who fail a cuff-leak test (CLT) prior to the intervention. Patients will be randomly assigned to either intravenous methylprednisolone (40 mg) or placebo 4 h prior to extubation. Other eligible patients who pass the CLT will be included in a non-intervention (observation) group. The primary endpoint is the incidence of PES within 48 h after extubation. Secondary endpoints include oxygen therapy, respiratory support requirements, reintubation secondary to PES, adverse effects within 48 h after extubation, hospital length of stay, and hospital mortality. DISCUSSION: Patients who are intubated on an emergency basis have a higher risk of intubation-related complications. Previous studies have examined treatment regimens involving more than 10 different variations on corticosteroid treatments for PES prevention, while for ED therapy, only a simple and effective treatment would be appropriate. Corticosteroid administration is usually accompanied by adverse effects; thus, this study will be important for further risk stratification among intubated ED patients.

We investigated the safety and efficacy of high-flow normobaric oxygen (NBO) after endovascular recanalization in anterior circulation stroke. This is a prospective randomized controlled study. Eligible patients were randomized to receive high-flow NBO by a Venturi mask (FiO(2) 50%, flow 15 L/min) or routine low-flow oxygen supplementation by nasal cannula (flow 3 L/min) after vessel recanalization for 6 h. Patient demographics, procedural metrics, complications, functional outcomes, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and infarct volume were assessed. A total of 91 patients were treated with high-flow NBO. NBO treatment revealed a common odds ratio of 2.2 (95% CI, 1.26 to 3.87) favoring the distribution of global disability scores on the mRS at 90 days. The mortality at 90 days was significantly lower in the NBO group than in the control group, with an absolute difference of 13.86% (rate ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.13–0.93). A significant reduction of infarct volume as determined by MRI was noted in the NBO group. The median infarct volume was 9.4 ml versus 20.5 ml in the control group (beta coefficient, − 20.24; 95% CI, − 35.93 to − 4.55).

Clone CC3 is not only able to neutralize a wild-type (WT) strain of chikungunya virus (CHIKV), but also neutralizes WT strains of Mayaro virus (MAYV) and Ross River virus (RRV); both arthralgic, Old World alphaviruses. Interestingly, CC3 also demonstrated a degree of neutralizing activity against the New World alphavirus, Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV); albeit both the vaccine strain, TC-83, and the parental, WT Trinidad donkey strain had PRNT(50) values ~1,000-fold higher than that of CHIKV. However, no neutralization activity was observed with Western equine encephalitis virus (WEEV). Ten CC3 variants designed to possess a range of isoelectric points, both higher and lower, were constructed. This approach successfully identified several lower pI mutants which possessed improved thermal stabilities by as much as 10°C over the original CC3 (T(m) = 62°C), and excellent refolding abilities while maintaining their capacity to bind and neutralize CHIKV.","Liu, Jinny L.; Webb, Emily M.; Zabetakis, Dan; Burke, Crystal W.; Gardner, Christina L.; Glass, Pamela J.; Legler, Patricia M.; Weger-Lucarelli, James; Anderson, George P.; Goldman, Ellen R.",Front Med (Lausanne),575,4

Despite many initiatives implemented in teacher education programs, however, their effectiveness in developing student–teachers’ PCK and factors affecting the PCK development are under-researched and evidenced. Drawing upon theories about and research on PCK, this study examined whether a recently updated 2-year teacher education program could develop student–teachers’ PCK effectively and explored what factors influencing the PCK development of student–teachers with different developmental trajectories. Forty English-as-foreign-language (EFL) student–teachers on the program were involved as participants. This study employed a longitudinal research design. Data were collected at four different stages along with the program through the content representation matrix, interviews with all the participants, and focus group interviews with four particularly sampled participants. Findings revealed that the current teacher education program successfully enhanced student–teachers’ PCK and the factors influencing different PCK developmental trajectories were varied and personalized. Implications for teacher education are also discussed.","Li, Shuo; Liu, Liyan; Jiang, Anne Li",Front Psychol,575,1

In this work, a three-dimensional (3D) supramolecular structure [Na(2)Cu(P–SO(3))(4)](n) (P–SO(3)H = pyrazine sulfonic acid) is synthesized by a hydrothermal method with the “soft–hard” strategy. The produced polymer is characterized by the elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, and X-ray crystallography. Crystal diffraction data indicate that the polymer belongs to the P4/ncc space group. Notably, the introduction of a soft alkali metal ion can trigger the specific affinity binding with sulfonate oxygen atoms to give rise to a Na–O-μ(4) bridging pattern. The flexible bridging pattern combined with the rigid structure of copper pyrazine sulfonate is likely to be responsible for the production of the final 3D supramolecular structure. Moreover, powder X-ray diffraction data indicated a good phase purity.

There are several ways of making data available to the public, from a simple website to sophisticated applications for accessing the data. In this context, one of the options is the construction of an open data portal using platforms for data repositories and catalogs. In the last few years, there has been a rapid proliferation of this type of portals, with domain or organization specific datasets being widely disseminated in platforms like CKAN. In these platforms, datasets are organized in thematic groups and described by keywords and other attributes assigned by the publisher. Usually described by metadata with poor semantics, these datasets very often remain as “data silos”, with no explicit connection or data integration mechanism, making it difficult for the users to locate and interrelate relevant data sources. In contrast, the Semantic Web focuses on a way of modeling and representing data in an easier manner to establish interrelationships between data, accompanied by richer descriptors. Based on this scenario, this paper proposes LigADOS, an approach to create interconnections between datasets considering their content and related metadata. LigADOS is based on the principles of the Semantic Web and associated linked data solutions and technologies, to support rich access strategies to RDF data published using portal platforms like CKAN and others.","de Figueiredo, Glaucia Botelho; de Faria Cordeiro, Kelli; Campos, Maria Luiza Machado",Metadata and Semantic Research,575,7

The brain disorders (including, but not limited to those affecting mental health) remain a major challenge. The understanding of mental disorders’ determinants and causes, processes and impacts is a key to their prevention, early detection and treatment as well as factor for good health and well-being. In order to improve the health and disease understanding, a close linkage between fundamental, clinical, epidemiological and socio-economic research is required. Effective sharing of data, standardized data processing and the linkage of such data with large-scale cohort studies is a prerequisite for translation of research findings into the clinic. In this context, this paper proposes a platform for exploration of behavioral changes in patients with proven cognitive disorders with a focus on Multiple Sclerosis. It adopts the concept of a digital twin by applying the Big Data and Artificial Intelligence technologies to allow for deep analysis of medical data to estimate human health status, accurate diagnosis and adequate treatment of patients. The platform has two main components. The first component, provides functionality for diagnostics and rehabilitation of Multiple Sclerosis and acts as a main provider of data for the second component. The second component is an advanced analytical application, which provides services for data aggregation, enrichment, analysis and visualization that will be used to produce a new knowledge and support decision in each instance of the transactional component.","Petrova-Antonova, Dessislava; Spasov, Ivaylo; Krasteva, Iva; Manova, Ilina; Ilieva, Sylvia",Computational Science and Its Applications - ICCSA 2020,575,7

Academic studies tend to focus on the new lives that are being led beyond the gayborhood and the diminished distinctiveness of the territories left behind (e.g. Ghaziani 2014). In contrast, this chapter explores the possibility that gayborhoods can continue to influence sociospatial dynamics, even after their physical presence has diminished or disappeared altogether. Individuals and collectives may still be inspired by the memories, representations, and imaginaries previously provided by these erstwhile places. Indeed, the metaphor of a non-heteronormative diaspora relies on an ‘origin’ from which a cultural network has dispersed. In this sense gayborhoods can continue to function as post-places, as symbolic anchors of identity that operate even if they no longer exist in a material form, even if they are used simply as markers of ‘how far the diaspora has come’. The proposition that gayborhoods are becoming post-places could be more fully theorized in a number of ways, but the approach here is to adapt Deleuze and Guattari’s (1987: 22) notion of plateaus, which denote a “region of intensities whose development avoids any orientation towards a culmination point or external end”. From this perspective gayborhoods are not spatial phenomena that reach a climax of concentration and then disappear through dissipation. Instead, they can be described as becoming more intense and concrete in the latter half of the twentieth century before gradually fading after the new millennium as they disperse gradually into a diaspora as memories, habits, and so forth. Put another way, non-climactic gayborhoods leave ‘afterglows’, affects that continue to exert geographical effects in the present and near future. This conceptualization is consequential for theory, practice, and political activism, and ends the main body of this edited volume on a more ambitious note.","Coffin, Jack",The Life and Afterlife of Gay Neighborhoods,575,1

The Covid-19 pandemic looks set to further amplify these problems. This Editorial begins by discussing the scale of the productivity slowdown and of the widening inequalities that have emerged, particularly with regard to their spatial dimension: that is how the uneven and slow development of productivity and rise in inequalities have played out across and within regions and cities. It then briefly considers underlying factors that lie behind these trends, including financialisation / financial globalization, the diminishing role of organised labour, segmentation of the labour market favouring workers who play a key role in financialisation, together with the increasing polarisation within societies according to skill and, crucially, the impact of changing industrial composition particularly as it relates to the rise of the high-tech sectors. The Editorial then examines in what ways the slowdown of productivity and widening of economic and spatial inequalities, may be interrelated, and questions the notion of any efficiency-equity trade-off. Lastly, it considers whether the ‘inclusive growth’ agenda can potentially reconcile the two ambitions of improving productivity performance and lessening inequalities, reflecting on what inclusive growth could mean, and what it could imply in terms of policy. Thus far, it appears that an inclusive growth agenda has only gained some traction at the subnational level, which seems to reflect – at least in part – attempts by cities and regions to address gaps in policy left by national governments.","Evenhuis, Emil; Lee, Neil; Martin, Ron; Tyler, Peter",,575,28

Among the members of this family, complement receptor 3 (CR3; CD11b/CD18, Mac-1, α(M)β(2)) is particularly promiscuous in its functional profile and ligand selectivity. There are close to 100 reported structurally unrelated ligands for CR3, and while many ligands appear to cluster at the α(M)I domain, molecular details about binding modes remain largely elusive. The versatility of CR3 is reflected in its functional portfolio, which includes prominent roles in the removal of invaders and cell debris, induction of tolerance and synaptic pruning, and involvement in the pathogenesis of numerous autoimmune and chronic inflammatory pathologies. While CR3 is an interesting therapeutic target for immune modulation due to these known pathophysiological associations, drug development efforts are limited by concerns of potential interference with host defense functions and, most importantly, an insufficient molecular understanding of the interplay between ligand binding and functional impact. Here, we provide a systematic summary of the various interaction partners of CR3 with a focus on binding mechanisms and functional implications. We also discuss the roles of CR3 as an immune receptor in health and disease, as an activation marker in research and diagnostics, and as a therapeutic target.","Lamers, Christina; Plüss, Carla Johanna; Ricklin, Daniel",Front Immunol,575,16

The peripheral blood of COVID‐19 patients have increased numbers of neutrophils which are important in controlling the bacterial infections observed in COVID‐19. We sought to evaluate the cytotoxic capacity of neutrophils in COVID‐19 patients. 34 confirmed COVID‐19 patients (29 severe, five mild disease), and nine healthy controls were recruited from the Masih Daneshvari Hospital (Tehran, Iran) from March to May 2020. Polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells were isolated from whole blood and incubated with green fluorescent protein (GFP)‐labelled methicillin‐resistant Staphylococcus aureus (SA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). Bacterial growth was determined by measuring the florescence of co‐cultures of bacteria and neutrophils and reported as the lag time before exponential growth. The number of viable bacteria was determined after 70 hours as colony‐forming units (CFU). The immunophenotype of tested cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. Isolated neutrophils have higher surface expression of CD16 and CD62L with negative markers for PMN‐MDSC. Bacterial growth in the presence of SA (22 ± 0.9 versus 9.2 ± 0.5 h, P < .01) and PA (12.4 ± 0.6 versus 4.5 ± 0.22, P < .01) was significantly reduced in COVID‐19 patients.

Urinary sodium, potassium, and chloride concentrations as well as urinary osmolality were lower in hAAT-Tg mice maintained on a high salt diet during both the active and inactive cycles. hAAT-Tg mice showed a lower systolic blood pressure compared to C57B6 mice when maintained on a normal salt diet but this was not observed when they were maintained on a high salt diet.

It is characterized by the increased concentration of glucose in the blood and leads to damage of the body system, especially blood vessels and nerves. Lifestyle modification is often combined with anti-diabetic therapy as the standard of care for T2DM to maintain the proper blood glucose and to prevent long-term diabetic complications. The role of probiotics in improving glycemic control has been investigated in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses, including different sets of trials have concluded an overall beneficial effect of probiotics in patients with T2DM. At least two RCTs with a longer treatment duration have been published since the publication of existing reviews. METHODS We will conduct a systematic review of RCTs that evaluated the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for glycemic control in T2DM patients. Primary outcomes are fasting blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (A1c). Secondary outcomes are plasma insulin, blood lipid profile, adverse events, and cost associated with the intervention and hospital visits. We will search PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library, and trial registries. Two reviewers will independently screen titles and abstracts, review full texts, extract information, and assess the risk of bias. We will summarize the results both qualitatively and statistically. We will use random-effects model for meta-analysis. DISCUSSION This systematic review aims to examine whether probiotics are effective and safe for glycemic control in T2DM patients. Evidence generated from this review will inform clinical and public health practice and future research.

But because viruses often infect multiple hosts and the numbers of distinct lineages within a host can be vast, their delineation into species is often dictated by arbitrary sequence thresholds, which are highly inconsistent across lineages. Here we apply an approach to determine the boundaries of viral species based on the detection of gene flow within populations, thereby defining viral species according to the biological species concept (BSC). Despite the potential for gene transfer between highly divergent genomes, viruses, like the cellular organisms they infect, assort into reproductively isolated groups and can be organized into biological species. This approach revealed that BSC-defined viral species are often congruent with the taxonomic partitioning based on shared gene contents and host tropism, and that bacteriophages can similarly be classified in biological species. These results open the possibility to use a single, universal definition of species that is applicable across cellular and acellular lifeforms.","Bobay, Louis-Marie; Ochman, Howard",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,575,1

General anesthesia with endotracheal intubation may be associated with side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, cough, and dizziness, whereas sedation offers the advantage of having the patient awake and breathing spontaneously. Until now, only diagnostic laparoscopy and minor surgical procedures have been performed in patients under conscious sedation. CASE DESCRIPTION Our report describes 5 cases of laparoscopic salpingo-oophorectomy successfully performed with the aid of conventional-diameter multifunctional instruments in patients under local anesthesia. Totally intravenous sedation was provided by the continuous infusion of propofol and remifentanil, administered through a workstation that uses pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models to titrate each drug, as well as monitoring tools for levels of conscious sedation and local anesthesia. We have labelled our current procedure with the acronym OLICS (Operative Laparoscopy in Conscious Sedation). Four of the patients had mono- or bilateral ovarian cysts and 1 patient, with the BRCA1 gene mutation and a family history of ovarian cancer, had normal ovaries. Insufflation time ranged from 19 to 25 minutes. All patients maintained spontaneous breathing throughout the surgical procedure, and no episodes of hypotension or bradycardia occurred. Optimal pain control was obtained in all cases. During the hospital stay, the patients did not need further analgesic drugs. All the women reported high or very high satisfaction and were discharged within 18 hours of the procedure. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION Salpingo-oophorectomy in conscious sedation is safe and feasible and avoids the complications of general anesthesia. It can be offered to well-motivated patients without a history of pelvic surgery and low to normal body mass index.","Rosati, Maurizio; Bramante, Silvia; Conti, Fiorella; Rizzi, Maria; Frattari, Antonella; Spina, Tullio",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,575,31

To reveal the impact of damming on the composition and flux changes of nutrients in rivers, this study conducted a detailed survey of a large sub-tropical reservoir (Xinanjiang Reservoir, XAJR) in eastern China from August 2013 to June 2014 obtaining samples at bi-monthly intervals. The thermal stratification, water quality in situ parameters, and the contents of nutrients in the water column of the river inflow, transition area, central reservoir area, and discharge water of the XAJR were analyzed in detail along the fluvial direction. The results show that the thermal stratification of the XAJR had seasonal and spatial heterogeneity. Accordingly, the pH and dissolved oxygen saturation degree in water also showed a similar stratification phenomenon. The analysis of nutrient limitation for primary productivity indicated that in different seasons, varying limiting degrees of the silicon or phosphorus were developed in different locations along the XAJR- river system. Among them, the river area and transition area were more susceptible to silicon restriction in winter, whereas phosphorus restriction mainly occurred during the warm seasons from April to October. XAJR had a retention effect on nitrogen, phosphorus, and silicon, among which phosphorus was more easily retained by the reservoir. In addition, nitrogen underwent transformation processes between different forms inside the reservoir. In the reservoir, the different degrees of retention effect of nutrients also led to a significant increase in the ratio of silicon to phosphorus and nitrogen to phosphorus in the discharged water. This study confirmed that thermal stratification has important control over the contents and forms of nutrients in water. This finding provided an idea for the restoration of the fluxes and stoichiometric ratios of the nutrients in the downstream river using the reservoir's capacity for artificial regulation.","Wang, Fushun",Water research,575,1

The administration of propofol sedation increases the risk of most complications, especially hypoxemia. Nevertheless, propofol has been increasingly used in the United States, and the trend is likely to increase in the years to come. Patient satisfaction and endoscopist satisfaction along with rapid turnover are some of the touted reasons for this trend. However, propofol sedation generally implies deep sedation or general anesthesia. As a result, hypopnea and apnea frequently occur. Inadequate sedation and presence of irritable airway often cause coughing and laryngospasm, both leading to hypoxemia and potential cardiac arrest. Hence, prevention of hypoxemia is of paramount importance. Traditionally, standard nasal cannula is used to administer supplement oxygen. However, it cannot sufficiently provide continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or positive pressure ventilation. Device manufacturers have stepped in to fill this void and created many types of cannulas that provide apneic insufflation of oxygen and CPAP and eliminate dead space. Such measures decrease the incidence of hypoxemia. This review aimed to provide essential information of some of these devices.","Goudra, Basavana; Gouda, Gowri; Singh, Preet Mohinder",Clinical endoscopy,575,20

Graphene is an extremely strong, electrically and thermally conductive two-dimensional hexagonal array of carbon atoms with the potential to transform applications such as supercapacitors, composites, biosensors, ultra-thin touchscreens, and solar cells. However, many of these applications require the use of exfoliated graphene, and the current cost of this material can be prohibitive. The most cost-effective source of graphene is exfoliated graphite, and numerous approaches have been proposed for exfoliating graphite to graphene. Solution approaches are the most common, with graphite often exfoliated by extended sonication treatment followed by separation of graphene from graphite using centrifugation. This time-consuming approach results in low concentrations of small lateral dimension graphene, often in high-boiling-point organic solvents or containing stabilizers. In this study, a chromatographic approach is used in combination with a solvent interface trapping method of graphite exfoliation to isolate graphene. The interface trapping exfoliation approach uses a hydrophobic/hydrophilic solvent interface to spontaneously exfoliate graphite and form a graphene-stabilized water-in-oil emulsion. This emulsion contains both graphene and graphite, and when added to water-wet glass beads, graphene adsorbs onto the glass surface, leaving graphite in the hydrophobic mobile phase, where it is removed by washing with an additional oil phase. The efficiency of this scalable approach to separation is demonstrated by Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and Tyndall effect scattering.","Abeykoon, Prabodha G; Ward, Shawn P; Chen, Feiyang; Adamson, Douglas H",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,575,11

However, the prevalence of AQP4-IgG seropositivity and MOG-IgG seropositivity in isolated ON is unclear, and studies comparing visual outcomes and optical coherence tomography (OCT)-derived structural retinal measures between MS-ON, AQP4-ON, and MOG-ON eyes are limited by small sample sizes. Objectives: (1) To assess the prevalence of AQP4-IgG and MOG-IgG seropositivity among patients presenting with isolated ON; (2) to compare visual outcomes and OCT measures between AQP4-ON, MOG-ON, and MS-ON eyes. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, a total of 65 eligible studies were identified by PubMed search. Statistical analyses were performed with random effects models. Results: In adults with isolated ON, AQP4-IgG seroprevalence was 4% in non-Asian and 27% in Asian populations, whereas MOG-IgG seroprevalence was 8 and 20%, respectively. In children, AQP4-IgG seroprevalence was 0.4% in non-Asian and 15% in Asian populations, whereas MOG-IgG seroprevalence was 47 and 31%, respectively. AQP4-ON eyes had lower peri-papillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL; -11.7 μm, 95% CI: -15.2 to -8.3 μm) and macular ganglion cell + inner plexiform layer (GCIPL; -9.0 μm, 95% CI: -12.5 to -5.4 μm) thicknesses compared with MS-ON eyes. Similarly, pRNFL (-11.2 μm, 95% CI: -21.5 to -0.9 μm) and GCIPL (-6.1 μm, 95% CI: -10.8 to -1.3 μm) thicknesses were lower in MOG-ON compared to MS-ON eyes, but did not differ between AQP4-ON and MOG-ON eyes (pRNFL: -1.9 μm, 95% CI: -9.1 to 5.4 μm; GCIPL: -2.6 μm, 95% CI: -8.9 to 3.8 μm). Visual outcomes were worse in AQP4-ON compared to both MOG-ON (mean logMAR difference: 0.60, 95% CI: 0.39 to 0.81) and MS-ON eyes (mean logMAR difference: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.40 to 0.96) but were similar in MOG-ON and MS-ON eyes (mean logMAR difference: 0.04, 95% CI: -0.05 to 0.14). Conclusions: AQP4-IgG- and MOG-IgG-associated disease are important diagnostic considerations in adults presenting with isolated ON, especially in Asian populations. Furthermore, MOG-IgG seroprevalence is especially high in pediatric isolated ON, in both non-Asian and Asian populations. Despite a similar severity of GCIPL and pRNFL thinning in AQP4-ON and MOG-ON, AQP4-ON is associated with markedly worse visual outcomes.","Filippatou, Angeliki G; Mukharesh, Loulwah; Saidha, Shiv; Calabresi, Peter A; Sotirchos, Elias S",Frontiers in neurology,575,16

The aim of this study was to determine accuracy of α-amylase in diagnosing microaspiration in critically ill patients. METHODS Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data collected in a medical ICU. All patients requiring mechanical ventilation for at least 48 h, and included in a previous randomized controlled trial were eligible for this study, provided that at least one tracheal aspirate was available for α-amylase measurement. As part of the initial trial, pepsin was quantitatively measured in all tracheal aspirates during a 48-h period. All tracheal aspirates were frozen, allowing subsequent measurement of α-amylase for the purpose of the current study. Microaspiration was defined as the presence of at least one positive tracheal aspirate for pepsin (>200 ng.mL-1). Abundant microaspiration was defined as the presence of pepsin at significant level in >74% of tracheal aspirates. RESULTS Amylase was measured in 1055 tracheal aspirates, collected from 109 patients. Using mean α-amylase level per patient, accuracy of α-amylase in diagnosing microaspiration was moderate (area under the receiver operator curve 0.72±0.05 [95%CI 0.61-0.83], for an α-amylase value of 1685 UI.L-1). However, when α-amylase levels, coming from all samples, were taken into account, area under the receiver operator curve was 0.56±0.05 [0.53-0.60]. Mean α-amylase level, and percentage of tracheal aspirates positive for α-amylase were significantly higher in patients with microaspiration, and in patients with abundant microaspiration compared with those with no microaspiration; and similar in patients with microaspiration compared with those with abundant microaspiration. α-amylase and pepsin were significantly correlated (r2 = 0.305, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION Accuracy of mean α-amylase in diagnosing microaspiration is moderate. Further, when all α-amylase levels were taken into account, α-amylase was inaccurate in diagnosing microaspiration, compared with pepsin.","Dewavrin, Florent; Zerimech, Farid; Boyer, Alexandre; Maboudou, Patrice; Balduyck, Malika; Duhamel, Alain; Nseir, Saad",PloS one,575,16

Chest CT comprised 92.61% of abnormal CT findings overall. Compared with real-time polymerase chain reaction result, CT findings has a sensitivity of 96.14% but a low specificity of 40.48% in diagnosing COVID-19. Ground glass opacity (GGO), pure (57.31%) or mixed with consolidation (41.51%) were the most common CT features with a majority of bilateral (80.32%) and peripheral (66.21%) lung involvement. The opacity might associate with other imaging features, including air bronchogram (41.07%), vascular enlargement (54.33%), bronchial wall thickening (19.12%), crazy-paving pattern (27.55%), interlobular septal thickening (42.48%), halo sign (25.48%), reverse halo sign (12.29%), bronchiectasis (32.44%), and pulmonary fibrosis (26.22%). Other accompanying signs including pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy and pericardial effusion were rare, but pleural thickening was common. The younger or early stage patients tended to have more GGOs, while extensive/multilobar involvement with consolidation was prevalent in the older or severe population. Children with COVID-19 showed significantly lower incidences of some ancillary findings than those of adults and showed a better performance on CT during follow up. Follow-up CT showed GGO lesions gradually decreased, and the consolidation lesions first increased and then remained relatively stable at 6-13 days, and then absorbed and fibrosis increased after 14 days.

Objective To evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool that assists with diagnoses of dermatologic conditions. Design, Setting, and Participants This multiple-reader, multiple-case diagnostic study developed an AI-based tool and evaluated its utility. Primary care physicians and NPs retrospectively reviewed an enriched set of cases representing 120 different skin conditions. Randomization was used to ensure each clinician reviewed each case either with or without AI assistance; each clinician alternated between batches of 50 cases in each modality. The reviews occurred from February 21 to April 28, 2020. Data were analyzed from May 26, 2020, to January 27, 2021. Exposures An AI-based assistive tool for interpreting clinical images and associated medical history. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary analysis evaluated agreement with reference diagnoses provided by a panel of 3 dermatologists for PCPs and NPs. Secondary analyses included diagnostic accuracy for biopsy-confirmed cases, biopsy and referral rates, review time, and diagnostic confidence. Results Forty board-certified clinicians, including 20 PCPs (14 women [70.0%]; mean experience, 11.3 [range, 2-32] years) and 20 NPs (18 women [90.0%]; mean experience, 13.1 [range, 2-34] years) reviewed 1048 retrospective cases (672 female [64.2%]; median age, 43 [interquartile range, 30-56] years; 41 920 total reviews) from a teledermatology practice serving 11 sites and provided 0 to 5 differential diagnoses per case (mean [SD], 1.6 [0.7]). The PCPs were located across 12 states, and the NPs practiced in primary care without physician supervision across 9 states. The NPs had a mean of 13.1 (range, 2-34) years of experience and practiced in primary care without physician supervision across 9 states. Artificial intelligence assistance was significantly associated with higher agreement with reference diagnoses. For PCPs, the increase in diagnostic agreement was 10% (95% CI, 8%-11%; P < .001), from 48% to 58%; for NPs, the increase was 12% (95% CI, 10%-14%; P < .001), from 46% to 58%. In secondary analyses, agreement with biopsy-obtained diagnosis categories of maglignant, precancerous, or benign increased by 3% (95% CI, -1% to 7%) for PCPs and by 8% (95% CI, 3%-13%) for NPs. Rates of desire for biopsies decreased by 1% (95% CI, 0-3%) for PCPs and 2% (95% CI, 1%-3%) for NPs; the rate of desire for referrals decreased by 3% (95% CI, 1%-4%) for PCPs and NPs. Diagnostic agreement on cases not indicated for a dermatologist referral increased by 10% (95% CI, 8%-12%) for PCPs and 12% (95% CI, 10%-14%) for NPs, and median review time increased slightly by 5 (95% CI, 0-8) seconds for PCPs and 7 (95% CI, 5-10) seconds for NPs per case.

RE-LYMP (reactive lymphocytes) is an extended inflammation parameter (EIP) reported by XN analyzer (Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan) reflect the activation of lymphocytes triggered by infections. We aimed to assess the clinical utility of these parameters as biomarkers for the rapid detection of COVID 19. METHODS The study group included 200 COVID 19 and 167 patients with other infections at admission. Differences of leukocyte differential, neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and EIP among groups were assessed with the Kruskal-Wallis test; parameters statiscally different in the groups were tested with Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to assess their diagnostic performance in distinguishing SARS-CoV-2 infections. The reliability of the selected parameters was evaluated in a validation group of 347 patients (160 COVID 19 and 187 other infections). RESULTS NLR performed well to discard viral infections, area under curve (AUC) 0.988 (95%CI 0.973 - 0.991) and RE-LYMP was useful to distinguish COVID 19 and bacterial infections AUC 0.920 (95%CI 0.884 - 0.948); the two conditions NLR> 3.3 RE-LYMP> 0.6% was applied to the validation group and 153 out of 160 COVID 19 patients were correctly distinguished (95.6%). CONCLUSIONS Early diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is critical for better caring of patients and to reduce the threat of nosocomial infection for professionals. Leukocyte differential and RE-LYMPH could assist in a preliminary differential diagnosis of the disease.","Urrechaga, Eloísa; Mugertza, Garazi; Fernández, Mónica; España, Pedro Pablo; Aguirre, Urko",Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation,575,1

While the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) encourages WRRFs to conduct job safety assessments to mitigate risks from bioaerosols, it does not provide clear guidance on respiratory protection requirements, leaving the use of N95 masks across the industry non-standardized and difficult to justify. Strategies need to be developed to cope with shortages during pandemics, and these should take into consideration a WRRF's size and disinfection equipment available. Our objective is to provide an overview of respiratory protection-related practices recommended for health care professionals that apply to WRRFs (e.g., elimination, substitution, extended use, reuse, disinfection). Reviewed N95 mask disinfection strategies included using hydrogen peroxide, autoclaving, moist heat, dry heat, ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), ethylene oxide, chlorine and ethanol. Of these, dry heat, autoclaving and UVGI present the most promise for WRRFs, with UVGI being limited to larger utilities. We recommend that WRRFs work closely with disinfection technology manufacturers, mask providers, health and safety staff and inspectors to develop suitable programs to cope with N95 mask shortages during pandemics.","Maal-Bared, Rasha; Loudon, Jennifer",Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,575,26

A wide margin (at least 5 mm) is generally recommended to prevent LR, but the optimal method to assess ablation margins is yet to be established. The aim of our study was to evaluate the feasibility and reproducibility of CT-CT co-registration, using MIRADA software, in order to assess ablation margins of patients with CRLM. METHODS In this retrospective study, pre- and post-ablation contrast-enhanced CT scans of 29 patients, treated with percutaneous RFA for a solitary CRLM, were co-registered. Co-registration was performed by two independent radiologist, based on venous structures in proximity to the tumor. Feasibility of CT-CT co-registration and inter-observer agreement for reproducibility and ablation margins was determined. Furthermore, the minimal ablation margin was compared with the occurrence of LR during follow-up. RESULTS Co-registration was considered feasible in 18 patients (61% male, 63.1(±10.9) year), with a perfect inter-observer agreement for completeness of ablation: κ = 1.0(p < 0.001). And substantial inter-observer agreement for measurement of the minimal margin (≤ 0 mm, 1-5 mm, ≥ 5 mm): κ = 0.723(p-value < 0.001). LR occurred in eight of nine(88.9%) incompletely ablated CRLM and in one of the nine completely ablated CRLM(11.1%). CONCLUSION Co-registration using MIRADA is reproducible and potentially a valuable tool in defining technical success. Feasibility of co-registration of pre- and post-ablation CT scans is suboptimal if scans are not acquired concordantly. Co-registration may potentially aid in the prediction of LR after percutaneous ablation.","Sibinga Mulder, B G; Hendriks, P; Baetens, T R; van Erkel, A R; van Rijswijk, C S P; van der Meer, R W; van de Velde, C J H; Vahrmeijer, A L; Mieog, J S D; Burgmans, M C",BMC medical imaging,575,1

This study aims to explore the expression profiles of metabolism-related genes (MRGs) in endometrial cancer (EC). METHODS We analyzed the expression of MRGs using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) data to screen differentially expressed MRGs (DE-MRGs) significantly correlated with EC patient prognosis. Functional pathway enrichment analysis of the DE-MRGs was performed. LASSO and Cox regression analyses were performed to select MRGs closely related to EC patient outcomes. A prognostic signature was developed, and the efficacy was validated in part of and the entire TCGA EC cohort. Moreover, we developed a comprehensive nomogram including the risk model and clinical features to predict EC patients' survival probability. RESULTS Forty-seven DE-MRGs were significantly correlated with EC patient prognosis. Functional enrichment analysis showed that these MRGs were highly enriched in amino acid, glycolysis, and glycerophospholipid metabolism. Nine MRGs were found to be closely related to EC patient outcomes: CYP4F3, CEL, GPAT3, LYPLA2, HNMT, PHGDH, CKM, UCK2 and ACACB. Based on these nine DE-MRGs, we developed a prognostic signature, and its efficacy in part of and the entire TCGA EC cohort was validated. The nine-MRG signature was independent of other clinical features, and could effectively distinguish high- and low-risk EC patients and predict patient OS. The nomogram showed excellent consistency between the predictions and actual survival observations. CONCLUSIONS The MRG prognostic model and the comprehensive nomogram could guide precise outcome prediction and rational therapy selection in clinical practice.","Jiang, Pinping; Sun, Wei; Shen, Ningmei; Huang, Xiaohao; Fu, Shilong",BMC cancer,575,12

METHODS Participants at three institutions were randomised to a Hands-on Surgical Training (HoST) technology group or a control group. The HoST group was given procedure-based training for UVA within the haptic-enabled AR-based HoST environment. The control group did not receive any training. After completing the task, the control group was offered to cross over to the HoST group (cross-over group). A questionnaire administered after HoST determined the feasibility and acceptability of the technology. Performance of UVA using an inanimate model on the daVinci Surgical System (Intuitive Surgical Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) was assessed using a UVA evaluation score and a Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS) score. Participants completed the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Task Load Index (NASA TLX) questionnaire for cognitive assessment, as outcome measures. A Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare outcomes among the groups (HoST group vs control group and control group vs cross-over group). RESULTS A total of 52 individuals participated in the study. UVA evaluation scores showed significant differences in needle driving (3.0 vs 2.3; P = 0.042), needle positioning (3.0 vs 2.4; P = 0.033) and suture placement (3.4 vs 2.6; P = 0.014) in the HoST vs the control group.

Neurologically impaired children were compared with neurologically normal children. Two low profile devices were compared for longevity. METHODS Ninety-eight patients (58 boys, mean age 4.66 years) with 107 gastrostomies inserted between April 2004 and May 2008 were included in this retrospective, single institution audit. Minimum follow-up period was 1 year. Specific complications reviewed were tube and site related. Logistic regression analysis examined the relationship between complications, type of procedure, method of placement, and neurological status. Survival analysis with log-rank test was used to compare the duration of the low-profile devices. RESULTS There were 63 primary gastrostomies and 44 with concurrent fundoplication, 71 children were neurologically impaired. Mean (±SD) follow-up time was 35.6 ± 1.4 months. There was a significant association between concurrent gastrostomy insertion with fundoplication and incidence of infection (odds ratio = 2.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.02-5.56, P = 0.02) and excoriation (odds ratio = 2.5, 95% CI 1.09-5.71, P = 0.015). There were no associations between the complications with gastrostomy placement and neurological status. Failure rate of the balloon device was significantly greater than the fixed bolster device with a Hazard Ratio for survival of 3.2 (95% CI 2.2-4.6). CONCLUSIONS Gastrostomy site-related problems were more common than generally reported. There was a higher incidence of site infection and skin excoriation for gastrostomy placement with concurrent fundoplication. There was no significant difference in complications between the method of gastrostomy placement or neurological status.

The analysis results differentiated between the determinants of the phobia for the 2 diseases, BSE and HPAI (N = 1002). As with HIV/AIDS and leprosy, the public fear of HPAI was expressed as a disease phobia that seeks to ensure the social exclusion of infection sources, whereas the fear of BSE was influenced by social and communication factors. Therefore, BSE, unlike previous HPAI, can be rapidly amplified amid the growing distrust in health communication, in which case the social determinants of disease phobia are associated with communicator trust, social values, and political attitude toward diseases rather than disease perception.","Jung, Minsoo; Choi, Mankyu; Lee, Tae-Ro",Asia-Pacific journal of public health,575,11

In addition, vitamin D has been associated with pulmonary function and the incidence of airway infections. As vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients, supplementation might have a beneficial effect in these patients. OBJECTIVE To assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on respiratory muscle strength and physical performance in vitamin D-deficient COPD patients. Secondary outcomes are pulmonary function, handgrip strength, exacerbation rate, and quality of life. METHODS We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial. Participants were randomly allocated to receive 1,200 IU vitamin D3 per day (n=24) or placebo (n=26) during 6 months. Study visits were conducted at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months after randomization. During the visits, blood was collected, respiratory muscle strength was measured (maximum inspiratory and expiratory pressure), physical performance and 6-minute walking tests were performed, and handgrip strength and pulmonary function were assessed. In addition, participants kept a diary card in which they registered respiratory symptoms. RESULTS At baseline, the mean (standard deviation [SD]) serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentration (nmol/L) was 42.3 (15.2) in the vitamin D group and 40.6 (17.0) in the placebo group. Participants with vitamin D supplementation had a larger increase in serum 25(OH)D compared to the placebo group after 6 months (mean difference (SD): +52.8 (29.8) vs +12.3 (25.1), P<0.001). Primary outcomes, respiratory muscle strength and physical performance, did not differ between the groups after 6 months. In addition, no differences were found in the 6-minute walking test results, handgrip strength, pulmonary function, exacerbation rate, or quality of life. CONCLUSION Vitamin D supplementation did not affect (respiratory) muscle strength or physical performance in this pilot trial in vitamin D-deficient COPD patients.","Rafiq, Rachida; Prins, Hendrik J; Boersma, Wim G; Daniels, Johannes Ma; den Heijer, Martin; Lips, Paul; de Jongh, Renate T",International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,575,24

Such a sizeable computational cost hinders the broad applicability of smoothing splines. In practice, the full-sample smoothing spline estimator can be approximated by an estimator based on [Formula: see text] randomly selected basis functions, resulting in a computational cost of [Formula: see text]. It is known that these two estimators converge at the same rate when [Formula: see text] is of order [Formula: see text], where [Formula: see text] depends on the true function and [Formula: see text] depends on the type of spline.

METHODS Selected patients who underwent ILE for esophageal cancer between 2013 and 2020 were included. We retrospectively investigated the patients' background characteristics and the short-term surgical outcomes. RESULTS In this period, among a total of 858 esophagectomies, selected seventy-one patients (8.3%) underwent ILE, consisted of 17 cases with completely open procedures, 27 with hybrid MI-ILE, and 27 with total MI-ILE. The major indications for ILE were adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus or esophagogastric junction (33.8%) and patients with prior treatment of head and neck cancer (31.0%). Among these approaches, there were no significant differences in the characteristics including age, body mass index (BMI), tumor location, preoperative therapy, and clinical TNM stage, except for histology. Compared to the completely open and hybrid groups, incidences of both total and severe complications in the total MI-ILE group were significantly lower (total 70.6 vs. 66.6 vs. 37.0%, p=0.036; severe 35.3 vs. 44.4 vs. 11.1%, p=0.023), and also, those of pneumonia (41.2 vs. 29.6 vs. 7.4%, p=0.026) and postoperative stricture (11.8 vs. 18.5 vs. 0%, p=0.001) were significantly fewer in the total MI-ILE group. CONCLUSIONS We have been able to achieve the transition from completely open to total MI-ILE with better short-term outcomes. Total MI-ILE with linear-stapled anastomosis can be a good alternative to open procedures for the selected patients with reducing the incidence of postoperative pneumonia and anastomotic stricture.","Kanamori, Jun; Watanabe, Masayuki; Kozuki, Ryotaro; Toihata, Tasuku; Otake, Reiko; Takahashi, Keita; Okamura, Akihiko; Imamura, Yu; Mine, Shinji",Langenbeck's archives of surgery,575,12

The aim was to investigate the viral kinetics and factors associated with viral clearance during lopinavir/ritonavir-based combination treatment in non-severe patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS Sixty-four patients were retrospectively enrolled. Viral RNA was detected by real-time RT-PCR assay from sputum or throat swab samples at different time points. The patterns of viral kinetics were characterized, and factors associated with rapid viral clearance, which was defined as viral RNA undetectable within two weeks, were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression analyses. RESULTS All patients achieved viral RNA negativity and were discharged from the hospital. Furthermore, 48 (75%) and 16 (25%) patients achieved rapid and delayed viral clearance, respectively. The lymphocyte counts of rapid viral clearance patients (1.40 [1.20-1.80] × 109/L) were higher, when compared to delayed viral clearance patients (1.00 [0.70-1.47] × 109/L) (p=0.024). The multivariate logistic analysis revealed that high lymphocyte count (≥1.3×109/L) is an independent factor associated with rapid viral clearance (OR=7.62, 95% CI=1.15-50.34, p=0.035).

Immune insufficiency is responsible for the delayed viral clearance, suggesting that an immunomodulator should be considered to promote viral clearance in patients with low lymphocyte counts.","Ding, J-G; Li, J; Hong, L; Yu, X-Q; Ye, E-L; Sun, G-Q; Zhang, X-X; Chen, L; Sun, Q-F",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,575,27

However, the NGAL measurement timepoints vary from immediately after ROSC to several days later. The primary objective of this study was to determine an association between AKI and NGAL, both immediately (ROSC-NGAL) and 3 h after ROSC (3 h-NGAL), in OHCA patients with TTM. The secondary objective was to ascertain the association between NGAL levels in the early post-ROSC phase and the neurologic outcomes at discharge. METHODS This prospective observational study was conducted between January 2016 and December 2018 and enrolled adult OHCA patients (≥18 years) with TTM after ROSC. The serum NGAL level was measured both immediately and 3 h after ROSC. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the associations between AKI, poor neurologic outcome, and NGAL. RESULTS Among 861 OHCA patients, 89 patients were enrolled. AKI occurred in 48 (55.1%) patients. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, 3 h-NGAL was significantly associated with AKI (odds ratio [OR] 1.022; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.009-1.035; p = 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 3 h-NGAL for AKI was 0.910 (95% CI 0.830-0.960), and a cut-off value of 178 ng/mL was identified. Both ROSC-NGAL and 3 h-NGAL were not significantly associated with poor neurologic outcome on multivariate logistic regression analysis (ROSC-NGAL; OR 1.017; 95% CI 0.998-1.036; p = 0.084, 3 h-NGAL; OR 0.997; 95% CI 0.992-1.001; p = 0.113). CONCLUSIONS The serum NGAL concentration measured 3 h after ROSC is an excellent early predictive marker for AKI in OHCA patients treated with TTM. Future research is needed to identify the optimal measurement timepoint to establish NGAL as a predictor of neurologic outcome and to validate the findings of this research.","Choi, Yoon Hee; Lee, Dong Hoon; Lee, Jae Hee",BMC nephrology,575,13

In this study, we attempted to explain the clinical and laboratories characteristics of non-surviving patients, to identify the probable factors affecting disease progression. METHODS In a retrospective study, we assessed the data from dead adult patients who were hospitalized and laboratory diagnosed with COVID-19 during March 2020. The data were obtained from electronic medical records. Moreover, a checklist including demographic, clinical, laboratorial, imaging, and treatment data was completed for each one of the patients. In case of lack of information, a member of the research team contacted the first-degree relatives via phone. RESULTS Totally, 50 patients were enrolled in this study. The mean age was 68.0 ± 14.1 years. Of them, 29 (58%) patients were male. Notably, the median (IQR) hospitalization time was 4.0 (2.7-6.2) days and the duration between the first symptoms to death was 10.0 (5.0-14.5) days. Also, pre-existing morbidity was reported in 42 (84%) patients, and hypertension was the most common one with 28 (54%) patients. Interestingly, body temperature more than 37.5°C was reported in only 20 (40%) patients. Nevertheless, neutrophilia (≥7109/L) and lymphopenia (<1.0 109/L) were observed in 27 (54%) and 29 (58%) patients, respectively. Also, elevated levels of creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were common, which may be indicators of aggravation of the patients' status. CONCLUSION Besides age and underlying diseases, elevated creatinine level, neutrophil count, and the inflammatory indices along with the reduced lymphocyte count can be considered as indicators of disease progression. Hence, they should be considered for admission and surveillance of patients.","Hormati, Ahmad; Foroghi Ghomi, Seyed Yaser; Sohrabi, Masoudreza; Jafari, Saeedeh; Jabbari, Amir; Aminnejad, Reza; Afifian, Mahboubeh; RakhshanKhah, Elham; Ahmadpour, Sajjad",Archives of Iranian medicine,575,1

Our objective was to assess patient satisfaction with telemedicine during the COVID-19 era. Methods: Telemedicine visit data were gathered from Stanford Health Care (Stanford) and the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS). Patient satisfaction data from HSS were captured from a Press-Ganey questionnaire between April 19, 2020, and December 12, 2020, whereas Stanford data were taken from a novel survey instrument that was distributed to all patients between June 22, 2020, and November 1, 2020. Participants: There were 60,550 telemedicine visits at Stanford, each linked with a postvisit survey. At HSS, there were 66,349 total telemedicine visits with 7,348 randomly linked with a postvisit survey. Main Outcomes and Measures: Two measures of patient satisfaction were used for this study: (1) a patient's ""overall visit score"" and (2) whether the patient indicated the highest possible ""likelihood to recommend"" (LTR) score (LTR top box score). Results: The LTR top box percentage at Stanford increased from 69.6% to 74.0% (p = 0.0002), and HSS showed no significant change (p = 0.7067). In the multivariable model, the use of a cell phone (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.18; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12-1.23) and tablet (aOR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.07-1.23) was associated with higher overall scores, whereas visits with interrupted connections (aOR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.42-0.57) or help required to connect (aOR: 0.49; 95% CI: 0.42-0.56) predicted lower patient satisfaction. Conclusions: We present the largest published description of patient satisfaction with telemedicine, and we identify important telemedicine-specific factors that predict increased overall visit score. These include the use of cell phones or tablets, phone reminders, and connecting before the visit was scheduled to begin. Visits with poor connectivity, extended wait times, or difficulty being seen, examined, or understood by the provider were linked with reduced odds of high scores. Our results suggest that attention to connectivity and audio/visual definition will help optimize patient satisfaction with future telemedicine encounters.","Rodrigues, Adrian; Yu, Jonathan S; Bhambhvani, Hriday; Uppstrom, Tyler; Ricci, William M; Dines, Joshua S; Hayden-Gephart, Melanie",Telemedicine journal and e-health : the official journal of the American Telemedicine Association,575,31

METHODS In close collaboration with the French Ministry of Sports and a selected expert committee, 3 different questionnaires investigating 3 subgroup populations were included in the survey: (1) children, (2) adolescents, and (3) adults. RESULTS Forty-two percentage of children, 58.7% of adolescents, 36.4% of adults, and 39.2% of older people had reduced physical activity levels. Particularly, active transportation and endurance practices showed a significant decrease, while domestic, muscular strengthening, and flexibility activities increased. Sitting time and screen time increased, respectively, in 36.3% and 62.0% of children, 25.5% and 69.0% in adolescents, 24.6% and 41.0% in adults, and 36.1% and 32.1% in seniors. CONCLUSION The COVID-19 confinement period led to important modifications in individual movement behaviors at all ages, particularly favoring decreased physical activity and increased sedentariness. These findings suggest that the authors need to inform and encourage people to maintain and improve their physical activities and to change their sedentary time habits during postconfinement and during the period of a potential future lockdown.","Genin, Pauline Manon; Lambert, Céline; Larras, Benjamin; Pereira, Bruno; Toussaint, Jean-François; Baker, Julien Steven; Tremblay, Angelo; Thivel, David; Duclos, Martine",Journal of physical activity & health,575,16

Several institutions launched remote patient monitoring programs (RPMPs) to care for patients with COVID-19. We describe patients' perspectives on a COVID-19 RPMP at a National Comprehensive Cancer Center. METHODS Patients who tested positive for COVID-19 were eligible. Enrolled patients received a daily electronic COVID-19 symptom assessment, and a subset of high-risk patients also received a pulse oximeter. Monitoring was provided by a centralized team and was discontinued 14 days after a patient's positive test result and following 3 days without worsening symptoms. Patients who completed at least one assessment and exited the program were sent a patient engagement survey to evaluate the patient's experience with digital monitoring for COVID-19. RESULTS The survey was distributed to 491 patients, and 257 responded (52% completion rate). The net promoter score was 85%. Most patients agreed that the RPMP was worthwhile, enabled better management of their COVID-19 symptoms, made them feel more connected to their healthcare team, and helped prevent emergency room visits. Identified themes regarding patient-perceived value of a RPMP included (1) security: a clinical safety net; (2) connection: a link to their clinical team during a period of isolation; and (3) empowerment: an education on the virus and symptom management. CONCLUSION RPMPs are perceived to be of value to oncology patients with COVID-19. Policymakers should consider how these programs can be reimbursed to keep vulnerable patients at home and out of the acute care setting.","Daly, Bobby; Lauria, Tara S; Holland, Jessie C; Garcia, Jericho; Majeed, Jibran; Walters, Chasity B; Zablocki, Melissa; Chow, Kimberly; Strachna, Olga; Giles, Caitlin E; Kelly, Meghan F; Housen, Ashley; Canavan, Maryanne; Maresca, Nina M; Baser, Ray; Salvaggio, Rori; Robson, Mark E; Reidy-Lagunes, Diane L",JCO oncology practice,575,17

To alleviate the issue, we propose glyco-analytical multispecific proteolysis (Glyco-AMP) as a strategy for glycoproteomic characterization. Glyco-AMP consists of rapid, in-solution digestion of an analyte glycoprotein (or glycoprotein mixture) by a multispecific protease (or protease cocktail). Resulting glycopeptides are chromatographically separated by isomer-specific porous graphitized carbon nano-LC, quantified by high-resolution MS, and structurally elucidated by MS/MS. To demonstrate the consistency and customizability of Glyco-AMP methodology, the glyco-analytical performances of multispecific proteases subtilisin, pronase, and proteinase K were characterized in terms of quantitative accuracy, sensitivity, and digestion kinetics.

Understanding the disease dynamics of dengue is often difficult due to multiple strains circulating within a population. Interactions between dengue serotype dynamics may result in complex cross-immunity dynamics at the population level and create difficulties in terms of formulating intervention strategies for the disease. In this study, a nationally representative 16-year time series with over 43 000 serotyped dengue infections was used to infer the long-run effects of between and within strain interactions and their impacts on past outbreaks. We used a novel identification strategy incorporating sign-identified Bayesian vector autoregressions, using structural impulse responses, historical decompositions and counterfactual analysis to conduct inference on dengue dynamics post-estimation. We found that on the population level: (i) across-serotype interactions on the population level were highly persistent, with a one time increase in any other serotype associated with long run decreases in the serotype of interest (range: 0.5-2.5 years) and (ii) over 38.7% of dengue cases of any serotype were associated with across-serotype interactions.

However, predisposing factors and prognosis for ""NODID"" RSIE (NOt associated with cardiac Devices or Intravenous Drug use) remain unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate predisposing factors and prognosis of NODID RSIE compared to other RSIE forms. A retrospective cohort study (January 2008-January 2019) was conducted in a reference center on 300 patients diagnosed with IE. Endocarditis-related events were defined as related to IE in mortality or open-heart surgery during follow-up. A review and meta-analysis of associated literature (January 2008-January 2019) were also performed. Fifty-seven patients presented RSIE (19%), 22 of which were NODID RSIE (39%). Use of intravascular catheters (23% vs 3%; p = 0.027) and congenital heart diseases (18% vs 0%; p = 0.019) were associated with NODID RSIE. This group had a higher in-hospital mortality (23% vs 3%; p = 0.027) and endocarditis-related event rates (41% vs 6%; p = 0.001) than non-NODID RSIE. Furthermore, NODID RSIE was independently associated with in-hospital endocarditis-related events (OR = 19.29; 95%CI:2.23-167.16; p = 0.007). Our meta-analysis evaluated four studies and identified 96 cases (30%) of NODID RSIE from 320 total RSIE cases. NODID RSIE patients demonstrated higher in-hospital mortality (RR = 2.81; 95%CI:1.61-4.90; p < 0.001; I2 = 0.0%) and necessity of open-heart surgery (RR = 13.89; 95%CI:4.14-46.60; p < 0.001; I2 = 0.0%) than non-NODID RSIE cases. Our study suggests that NODID RSIE has the highest endocarditis-related event rate and in-hospital mortality among RSIE cases and therefore should not be considered a good-prognosis IE.","Rigau, Pau Vilardell; Moral, Sergio; Bosch, Daniel; Morales, Manel; Frigola, Josep Maria; Albert, Xavier; Robles, Rocío; Ballesteros, Esther; Roqué, Marta; Aboal, Jaime; Brugada, Ramon",Scientific reports,575,8

While much is known about HIV self-testing (HIVST), less is known about syphilis self-testing, particularly in low-income settings. The objective of this study is to determine context-specific facilitators and barriers for self-testing and to assess the usability of syphilis self-testing in Zimbabwe among men who have sex with men (MSM). Methods: This mixed methods study was conducted in Harare as part of a larger syphilis self-testing trial. The study included in-depth interviews (phase one) followed by usability testing and a second interview (phase two). In-depth interviews were conducted with MSM and key informants prior to syphilis self-testing. The same MSM then used the syphilis self-test, quantitatively assessed its usability and participated in a second in-depth interview. Phase one data was analysed using a thematic approach, guided by an adapted Social Ecological Model conceptual framework. Phase two interviews were analysed using Rapid Assessment Procedure qualitative methodology, and usability was assessed using a pre-established index, adapted from existing HIVST evaluation scales. Results: Twenty MSM and 10 key informants were recruited for phase one in-depth interviews and 16 of these MSM participated in phase two by completing a syphilis self-test kit. Facilitating factors for self-testing included the potential for increased privacy, convenience, autonomy and avoidance of social and healthcare provider stigma. Barriers included the fear to test and uncertainty about linkage to care and treatment. Data from the usability index suggested high usability (89.6% on a 0-100 scale) among the men who received the self-test. Conclusions: MSM in Zimbabwe were willing to use syphilis self-test kits and many of the barriers and facilitators were similar to those observed for HIVST. Syphilis self-testing may increase syphilis test uptake among sexual minorities in Zimbabwe and other low- and middle-income countries.","Sri-Pathmanathan, C.; Nhamo, D.; Mamvuto, T.; Chapwanya, G.; Terris-Prestholt, F.; Mahaka, I.; Marks, M.; Tucker, J.

The aim of this article is to contribute towards a wider analysis of remote qualitative interviews taking into consideration the context of qualitative research as a social practice, which is often overlooked in the body of literature. Methods. The study is based on twelve in-depth interviews with qualitative researchers conducted by the author. The data is analysed with the focus on social aspects of qualitative interviews which engage the interviewee and the interviewer alike. Results and conclusion. The analysis shows that, from the perspective of the researcher, the social aspects of qualitative interviews constitute an important part of the research method. The interview is a meeting that combines methodological features with the attitude of involved people. Researchers are accustomed to in-person interviews and from that perspective, they evaluate possible losses caused by remote research. However, as they self-reflect, this is not always an inherent feature of the new media but rather a question of how they are used and by whom. The interview is a meeting that utilises communication habits and experiences from both sides of the conversation - the interviewer and the interviewee. It is important to take this fact into consideration while analysing the potential of remote interviews, especially when social isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic is changing our communication habits. Cognitive value. The remote qualitative interviews are often described from the perspective of usability and effectiveness. This article describes researchers as a part of the research process who have their own attitudes and experiences in conducting research. From the perspective of social practices, these are almost as important as the knowledge and attitude of interviewees and they also affect the results of the research process.","Latkowski, M.",Journal of Education Culture and Society,575,1

Since then pandemic affected countries experienced difficulties implementing that distance learning to respond to the policy. In this regard this paper was carried out to identify additional instructional leadership competencies for teachers in managing learning in a pandemic. Evidence from the study of education shows that learning in disruption time is closely related to teacher’s management in innovating such high technological virtual learning. To find answers we conducted preliminary readings of the relevant literature. Next, we analyzed that information qualitatively by exploring what teacher instruction management is applicable during the pandemic. Then we found that additional teaching leadership competencies can be adopted to support students learning in virtual approaches such as reflective opportunities increasing truth among teachers and students keeping curiosity habits building productive communication initiative habit and more listening to understand others. Those additional teaching leadership competencies are useful to any party interested in supporting students learning in the pandemic disruption.","Muslimah, Muslimah; Sudarmo, Sudarmo",Nidhomul Haq : Jurnal Manajemen Pendidikan Islam,575,12

The outbreak delivered not only the condition of dying from infection but also forced people (especially office workers and students) to perform all working (office work, classes, assignments, etc.) and non-working activities (leisure activities such as social media, gaming, etc.) at home using handheld devices (HHDs). In this situation, HHD usage for longer durations is mainly responsible for work-related health issues. Therefore, the paper aims to explore HHD usage patterns and musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) amongst HHD users during homestay and the impact of individual and HHD usage–related factors on MSDs. Design/methodology/approach: From different states of India, 651 people (especially HHD users from universities and industries) were sampled by using systematic cluster random sampling. In addition, an online questionnaire was used to collect data on the prevalence and risk factors of MSDs. Finally, mean comparisons and chi-square analysis was used to analyse the collected data. Findings: The prevalence rate of MSDs was higher in upper body parts as compared to the lower body parts. The association of gender with MSDs in various body parts was substantial. The time spent on various working and non-working activities using HHDs was significantly associated with MSDs in upper body parts. Practical implications: Homestay work may be used as an alternative working arrangement, and the risk factors that have the most significant impact on the health of HHD users may be identified by organizations. The findings suggest the proper use of HHDs as per their essential need with intermediate recreational activities.

The current study assessed psychosocial functioning in a sample of older adults in the UK with baseline data collected pre-lockdown and follow-up 12 weeks later during lockdown. Thus, allowing investigation of the effect of COVID-19 and associated lockdown on psychosocial well-being. Thirty-five older adults (Mean age = 76.06, sex = 12 males) participated in this repeated measures study. A final follow-up was then conducted post-lockdown to capture any factors that were viewed as helpful to well-being during lockdown. From pre- to during lockdown, perceived stress, well-being, depressive symptoms, mood disturbance and memory were all significantly worsened. There were significant improvements in self-reported physical health symptoms, social interaction, time spent engaging in physical activity and certain aspects of relationship quality. Follow-up showed that well-being, depression and mood were still negatively affected post-lockdown. Given the sample were all ‘healthy’ at baseline in comparison to established norms, there may be greater impairment in more vulnerable populations. Support for older populations is needed to mitigate the negative effects shown, particularly in light of the endurance of some of these effects post-lockdown. © The Author(s) 2021.","Docherty, S.; Haskell-Ramsay, C.

Social distancing may impact number/type of sex partnerships and access to STI testing and treatment. The objective was to compare the number of reported sex partnerships and gonorrhea and chlamydia prevalence pre- and during-pandemic among a cohort of gay, bisexual and other men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) in Baltimore, Maryland, a U.S. city with sustained STI epidemics.MethodsThis study was nested in a cohort study of sexually active MSM aged 18–45, and included participants who had at least one study visit after March 13, 2020 (during-pandemic) and ≤ six months between their first during-pandemic and last pre-pandemic visit. Wilcoxon and McNemar tests for paired data were used for statistical testing.ResultsAmong 417 MSM enrolled in the cohort, 220 (52.8%) were included. 213 (96.8%) had a visit between April 6-June 30, 2020 (during-pandemic1);185 (84.1%) had a visit between July 1-September 30, 2020 (during-pandemic2), including seven who missed the during-pandemic1 visit. The majority were Black (73.2%) and aged 24–35 (56.4%);42% were living with HIV. Compared to pre-pandemic, the median number of total and casual male sex partners (past three months) significantly declined during-pandemic1 and during-pandemic2 (Total partners: pre-pandemic: 2.0 (range: 0–75);during-pandemic1: 1.0 (0–25), p&lt;0.0001;during-pandemic2: 1.0 (0–20) p&lt;0.0001;Casual partners: pre-pandemic: 1.0 (0–75);during-pandemic1: 0.0 (0–25) p&lt;0.0001, during-pandemic2: 1.0 (0–20), p=0.004). Among those tested both pre- and during-pandemic2, (n=96) STI prevalence was similar (gonorrhea: 14.1% vs. 15.8%, p=0.847;chlamydia: 7.0% vs. 9.5%, p=0.527).ConclusionsAlthough overall and casual sex partnerships declined significantly during- compared to pre-pandemic, STI prevalence was similar. The observed decreased sex partnerships may not have substantially altered transmission dynamics or were offset by increased prevalence due to limited access to testing/treatment. Improved understanding of how COVID-19 mitigation measures alter STI transmission dynamics is needed.","Schumacher, C.; Thornton, N.; Tilchin, C.; Ghanem, K.; Hamill, M.; Rompalo, A.; Latkin, C.; Ruhs, S.; Rives, S.; Jennings, J.",Sexually Transmitted Infections,575,16

The way the media reports on the vaccine may influence or affect how the population perceive the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. Methods: The aim of this study was to determine how newspapers in Nigeria report stories about the vaccine and the side effects of the vaccine amidst the growing fear on the safety of the vaccine. A total of 4 national daily newspapers were randomly selected for the study. These are Leadership, Guardian, Nation and Punch newspapers. The study was anchored on agenda setting theory. Quantitative content analysis research was used for the study. The duration of the study was the day the vaccine was introduced in Nigeria: March 1st,2021 to July 31st, 2021. An Excel sheet served as the instrument for data collection and analysis done using SPSS version 25 with the level of significance predetermined at a p-value less than 0.05. Results: Key findings from this research were: Government officials and technical experts were predominantly used by the newspapers as the source of their information. There was a mixed reporting of vaccine side effects with a significant difference between those newspaper publications that reported vaccine side effects and those that did not. Amongst those that reported side effects, there was also a significant difference between those that communicated how and where to report the side effects as against those that did not. Conclusion: As part of the effort to curtail vaccine hesitancy, a continuous improvement in communicating the vaccine efficacy and safety is needed.

In Sphingobium sp. strain SYK-6, syringate is O demethylated to gallate by consecutive reactions catalyzed by DesA and LigM, and vanillate is O demethylated to protocatechuate by a reaction catalyzed by LigM. The gallate ring is cleaved by DesB, and protocatechuate is catabolized via the protocatechuate 4,5-cleavage pathway. The transcriptions of desA, ligM, and desB are induced by syringate and vanillate, while that of ligM and desB are negatively regulated by the MarR-type transcriptional regulator DesR, which is not involved in desA regulation. Here we clarified the regulatory system for desA transcription by analyzing the IclR-type transcriptional regulator desX, located downstream of desA. Quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR analyses of a desX mutant indicates that the transcription of desA was negatively regulated by DesX. In contrast, DesX was not involved in the regulation of ligM and desB. The ferulate catabolic genes (ferBA) under the control of a MarR-type transcriptional regulator FerC are located upstream of desA. RT-PCR analyses suggest that the ferB-ferA-SLG_25010-desA gene cluster consists of the ferBA operon and the SLG_25010-desA operon. Promoter assays reveal that a syringate- and vanillate-inducible promoter is located upstream of SLG_25010. Purified DesX bound to this promoter region, which overlaps with an 18-bp-inverted repeat sequence that appears to be essential for the DNA binding of DesX. Syringate and vanillate inhibited the DNA binding of DesX, indicating that these compounds are effector molecules of DesX. IMPORTANCE Syringate is a major degradation product in the microbial and chemical degradation of syringyl lignin. Along with other low-molecular-weight aromatic compounds, syringate is produced by chemical lignin depolymerization. Converting this mixture into value-added chemicals using bacterial metabolism (i.e., biological funneling) is a promising option for lignin valorization. To construct an efficient microbial lignin conversion system, it is necessary to identify and characterize the genes involved in the uptake and catabolism of lignin-derived aromatic compounds and elucidate their transcriptional regulation. In this study, we found that the transcription of desA, encoding syringate O-demethylase in SYK-6, is regulated by an IclR-type of transcriptional regulator, DesX. The findings of this study, combined with our previous results on desR (a MarR transcriptional regulator that controls the transcription of ligM and desB), provide an overall picture of the transcriptional regulatory systems for syringate and vanillate catabolism in SYK-6.","Araki, Takuma; Tanatani, Kenta; Kamimura, Naofumi; Otsuka, Yuichiro; Yamaguchi, Muneyoshi; Nakamura, Masaya; Masai, Eiji",bioRxiv,575,25

The proposed method consists of three steps: detecting the nucleus and cytoplasm, extracting features, and classification. At first, a new algorithm is designed to segment the nucleus. For the cytoplasm to be detected, only a part of it located inside the convex hull of the nucleus is involved in the process. This attitude helps us overcome the difficulties of segmenting the cytoplasm. In the second phase, three shapes and four novel color features are devised and extracted. Finally, by using an SVM model, the WBCs are classified. The segmentation algorithm can detect the nucleus with a dice similarity coefficient of 0.9675. The proposed method can categorize WBCs in Raabin-WBC, LISC, and BCCD datasets with accuracies of 94.65 %, 92.21 %, and 94.20 %, respectively. It is worth mentioning that the hyperparameters of the classifier are fixed only with the Raabin-WBC dataset, and these parameters are not readjusted for LISC and BCCD datasets. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed method is robust, fast, and accurate.","Tavakoli, Sajad; Ghaffari, Ali; Kouzehkanan, Zahra Mousavi; Hosseini, Reshad",bioRxiv,575,20

Timely and effective control of the pandemic is highly dependent on preventive approaches. Perception of risk is a major determinant of health behavior. The current study explores the association between actual risk and perceived risk for one’s self, family/friends and friends, and community. A questionnaire was administered to participants in Central Appalachia (n = 102). The actual risk was based on the number of chronic conditions of the following conditions: hypertension, heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Participants were also queried about their perception of risk for COVID-19. Generalized Linear Models were used to independently evaluate the likelihood of perceived risk for one’s: self, family/friends, and community, based on actual risk. Actual risk for COVID-19 was significantly associated with higher likelihood of higher perception of risk for one’s self (b = 0.24;p = 0.04), but not with one’s family/friends (b = 0.05;p = 0.68), or one’s community (b = 0.14;p = 0.16). No health insurance was negatively associated with perception of risk for self (b = −0.59;p = 0.04) and family/friends (b = −0.92;p < 0.001). Male gender (b = −0.47;p = 0.01) was also negatively associated with perception of risk for family/friends. In conclusion, individuals’ actual risk for COVID-19 is associated with their own perception of risk. This indicates that one’s perception of risk for COVID-19 is greater for their own health compared to their family/friends or the community. Therefore, monitoring and following up with chronic disease patients and addressing their lack of awareness of risk to others is needed to prevent and curtail the spread of COVID-19.","Ahuja, Manik Mamudu Hadii M.; Weierbach, Florence M.; Dowling-McClay, Karilynn Stewart David W.; Awasthi, Manul Paul Timir K.",Humanities & Social Sciences Communications,575,5

The first mechanism is the introduction of user referrals. We compare four scenarios for the uptake of CTAs - (1) the p% of individuals that use the CTA are chosen randomly, (2) a smaller initial set of randomly-chosen users each refer a contact to use the CTA, achieving p% in total, (3) a small initial set of randomly-chosen users each refer around half of their contacts to use the CTA, achieving p% in total, and (4) for comparison, an idealised scenario in which the p% of the population that uses the CTA is the p% with the most contacts. Using agent-based epidemiological models incorporating a geometric space, we find that, even when the uptake percentage p% is small, CTAs are an effective tool for mitigating the spread of the epidemic in all scenarios. Moreover, user referrals significantly improve efficacy. In addition, it turns out that user referrals reduce the yearly quarantine load. The second mechanism for increasing the efficacy of CTAs is tuning the severity of quarantine measures. Our modelling shows that using CTAs with mild quarantine measures is effective in reducing the maximum hospital load and the number of people who become ill, but leads to a relatively high quarantine load, which may cause economic disruption. Fortunately, under stricter quarantine measures, the advantages are maintained but the quarantine load is reduced. Our models incorporate geometric inhomogeneous random graphs to study the effects of the presence of super-spreaders and of the absence of long-distant contacts (e.g., through travel restrictions) on our conclusions.","Goldberg, L.

Additionally, we explored how methodological differences (direct vs. self-report measures) may affect these estimates. We hypothesized that direct prevalence measures of taste loss would be the most valid because they avoid the taste/smell confusion of self-report. The meta-analysis showed that, among 138,897 COVID-19-positive patients, 39.2% reported taste dysfunction (95% CI: 35.34-43.12%), and the prevalence estimates were slightly but not significantly higher from studies using direct (n = 18) versus self-report (n = 223) methodologies (Q = 0.57, df = 1, p = 0.45).

Resource parents (n = 648) were surveyed about COVID-19 concerns, positive impact and strengths, access to and helpfulness of provided resources, visits with birth parents, children joining their families during the pandemic, and transition to telehealth. Between one-third and half of resource parents with foster or foster-adoptive children in their home reported significant anxiety about issues such as getting infected, uncertainty about the future, and financial hardship. In contrast, most resource parents reported some perceived benefits, such as increased family closeness. The most helpful resource reported was video visitation by social workers. A quarter of resource parents experienced in-person birth parent visits. Developmentally, parents with a foster or fosteradoptive child 0?5 years old reported significantly more worries related to COVID-19, while those with children of multiple ages reported feeling less valued as a resource parent and expressed more concerns about children falling behind with school, mental health and developmental services, birth parent visits, and delayed reunification. Lastly, younger parental age, fewer foster children in the home, and the less negative impact from COVID-19 a resource parent reported having were associated with an increased likelihood of resource parents welcoming a child into their home. Implications for policy and recommendations for practice are discussed.","Langley, Audra K.; Ruderman, Matthew A.; Waterman, Jill Franke Todd",Developmental Child Welfare,575,25

The metropolis of Guayaquil registers the highest urban growth rate in Ecuador, occupying an urban area of 97.46%, where only 2.54% of the inhabitants are in rural areas. In this study, an analysis is made of the main problems detected in the urban planning of Guayaquil where social actors, endogenous resources, among other fundamental components for the development of local development programs, are identified, focused on the five rural parishes of Guayaquil canton. It is concluded that local development historically has not obeyed models or strategies conceived with the participation of the academy, although a group of researchers has shown special interest in recent years in bringing to society the scientific results obtained in the scientific field. The systemic analysis carried out in the planning of Guayaquil constitutes an opportunity to position the territory as an option for rural and community tourism, also considering the urban regulations regarding health that the COVID-19 pandemic has imposed. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Sánchez Padilla, M.

The objective of this study was to generate insights on COVID-19 mortality-associated factors and identify potential new therapeutic options for COVID-19 patients by employing artificial intelligence analytics on real-world data. Materials and Methods: A Bayesian statistics-based artificial intelligence data analytics tool (bAIcis(R)) within Interrogative Biology(R) platform was used for network learning, inference causality and hypothesis generation to analyze 16,277 PCR positive patients from a database of 279,281 inpatients and outpatients tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by antigen, antibody, or PCR methods during the first pandemic year in Central Florida. This approach generated causal networks that enabled unbiased identification of significant predictors of mortality for specific COVID-19 patient populations. These findings were validated by logistic regression, regression by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, and bootstrapping. Results: We found that in the SARS-CoV-2 PCR positive patient cohort, early use of the antiemetic agent ondansetron was associated with increased survival in mechanically ventilated patients. Conclusions: The results demonstrate how real world COVID-19 focused data analysis using artificial intelligence can generate valid insights that could possibly support clinical decision-making and minimize the future loss of lives and resources.","Miller, G.

We studied whether such indicators could reliably have anticipated the second COVID-19 wave in European countries. Contrary to theoretical predictions, we found that characteristic early warning indicators generally decreased rather than increased prior to the second wave. A model explains this unexpected finding as a result of transient dynamics and the multiple time scales of relaxation during a non-stationary epidemic. Particularly, if an epidemic that seems initially contained after a first wave does not fully settle to its new quasi-equilibrium prior to changing circumstances or conditions that force a second wave, then indicators will show a decreasing rather than an increasing trend as a result of the persistent transient trajectory of the first wave. Our simulations show that this lack of time scale separation was to be expected during the second European epidemic wave of COVID-19. Overall, our results emphasize that the theory of critical slowing down applies only when the external forcing of the system across a critical point is slow relative to the internal system dynamics.","Dablander, F.; Heesterbeek, H.; Borsboom, D.; Drake, J.

A few attempts have been made to address the problem of controlling both the epidemic size and duration simultaneously from a theoretical point of view, by primarily using the Optimal control theory. In this study, a multi-objective optimal control problem has been simulated to gauge the success of the lockdowns in India. To accomplish this objective, a system dynamics modeling was used to simulate the Susceptible-Infected-Quarantined-Removed epidemic model. A set of sensitivity experiments for different scenarios allows illustrating the model's behavior and its value for decision-makers regarding the lockdown intensity. The simulation of the model presents various scenarios, wherein the cost-benefit analysis of lockdown was done. Notably, the lockdown success intensity was defined, post which, the findings indicate that the states of Uttar Pradesh, Kerala, Panjab, Jammu, Kashmir, Haryana, and Bihar have achieved more than 90% lockdown success intensity. Further, it was observed that these states could effectively implement lockdowns by strictly enforcing social distancing measures during the early stages of the virus spread, which in turn resulted in the high success rate of lockdowns.","Kumar, A.; Viswakarma, N.

However, non-English-language science is expected to bring unique and valuable scientific information, especially in disciplines where the evidence is patchy, and for emergent issues where synthesising available evidence is an urgent challenge. Yet such contribution of non-English-language science to scientific communities and the application of science is rarely quantified. Here we show that non-English-language studies provide crucial evidence for informing global biodiversity conservation. By screening 419,680 peer-reviewed papers in 16 languages, we identified 1,234 non-English-language studies providing evidence on the effectiveness of biodiversity conservation interventions, compared to 4,412 English-language studies identified with the same criteria. Relevant non-English-language studies are being published at an increasing rate, and can expand the geographical (by 12-25%) and taxonomic (by 5-32%) coverage of English-language evidence, especially in biodiverse regions, albeit often based on less robust study designs. Our results show that synthesising non-English-language studies is key to overcoming the widespread lack of local, context-dependent evidence and facilitating evidence-based conservation globally.

Vaccination and antiviral drugs remain the most useful ways to protect against seasonal influenza and its potentially severe consequences. This study describes the epidemiology, antigenic and genetic characteristics, and antiviral susceptibilities of influenza viruses isolated from the mainland of China during the April 1, 2019 through October 4, 2020. Methods: All viruses analyzed were isolated and submitted by Chinese National Influenza Surveillance Network laboratories. The Chinese National Influenza Center performed antigenic analysis, sequencing, and antiviral resistance testing after propagation of the viruses. Antigenic characterizations were determined by hemagglutinin inhibition assay;next-generation sequencing was used for genetic analyses;phenotypic assay and next-generation sequencing were used for determining antiviral resistance. Results: The influenza positivity rate declined significantly starting in late January 2020 and has remained low. There was no summer influenza peak season in south China. Influenza A(H3N2) and B/Victoria lineage viruses were the dominant subtype/lineage during April 1, 2019 through October 4, 2020. The majority of influenza viruses were antigenically and genetically similar to reference viruses representing components of vaccines for the 2020-2021 northern hemisphere influenza season. Nearly all seasonal influenza viruses were susceptible to oseltamivir and zanamivir. Conclusions and Implications for Public Health Practice: Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the influenza positivity rate declined with implementation of strong COVID-19 control measures. The majority of circulating viruses are well matched with the current 2020-2021 northern hemisphere influenza vaccine viruses. Circulating seasonal influenza viruses were sensitive to neuraminidase inhibitors and Baloxavir marboxil.

The Argentine Society of Rheumatology (SAR) designed a national registry called SAR-COVID in order to get to assess our reality. Objectives: To identify the particular characteristics of patients with rheumatic diseases and COVID-19 in Argentina (SAR-COVID Registry), and to compare them with the data reported at the Latin American and Global level (Global International Alliance Rheum-COVID Registry). Methods: A national, multicenter, prospective and observational registry was carried out. Patients older than 18 years, with a diagnosis of rheumatic disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection by PCR or serology, were included between August 13, 2020 and January 17, 2021. Demographic data, underlying rheumatic disease (activity of the disease, current treatment), comorbidities, clinical-laboratory characteristics of the SARS-CoV-2 infection, as well as received treatments (pharmacological, oxygen therapy / ventilatory support) and outcomes (hospitalization, mortality) were recorded. The characteristics of the included patients were compared with the data reported at the Latin American and global level. Descriptive statistics were performed. Comparisons between groups were made using ANOVA, chi2 or Fisher's test, according to the type of variable. Results: Four hundred sixty-five patients from Argentina, 74 patients from Latin America and 583 from the rest of the world were included, mostly women (79.6%, 73% and 71% respectively), with a mean age of 50.2 (SD 15.3), 53.5 (DE 15.6) and 55.8 (15.5), years respectively. The most frequent rheumatic diseases in the three groups were rheumatoid arthritis (43.9%, 35%, and 39%) and systemic lupus erythematosus (16.1%, 22%, and 14%) (Table 1). In Argentina, fewer patients received specific pharmacological treatment for COVID-19 (40.9%, 68% and 43% respectively, p <0.0001), and there was a lower requirement of NIMV / IMV (Non-Invasive Mechanical Ventilation/Invasive Mechanical Ventilation) than in the rest of Latin America and the world (10.5% vs 31% vs 13%, p <0.0001). Hospitalization was lower in Argentina than in the rest of Latin America (37.4% vs 61% p 0.0002) and of the world (37.4% vs 45% p 0.0123), and mortality was numerically lower in Argentina, but without statistically significant differences between the three groups (6.9%, 12% and 11%;p 0.6311). Most of the patients, (86.9%) did not present any complications in Argentina, with a statistically significant difference with the rest of the groups (62% and 77%, p <0.0001) (Graph 1). Conclusion: The patients with rheumatic diseases and SARS-CoV-2 infection reported in this argentinian registry received less specific pharmacological treatment for COVID-19, presented fewer complications and required less ventilatory support, than those reported in the Latinoamerican and Global registry.

Analysing the results of Izod impact test, the projectile velocity of impact for a trivial plate such as of 5mm thickness was used. The results from a trivial case impact test were used to predict the velocity of impact on the identical volume samples. The identical volume samples such as plate, plate stiffened by Isogrid without H-ribs, plate stiffened by Isogrid with H-ribs were used. Also, these results were correlated with simulations, and it was found that Isogrid stiffened plate with H-ribs was more stable.","Murthy, V C A D; Santhanakrishnanan, Soundarapandian",Procedia Manufacturing,575,8

This study determined whether OSA defined using a hypopnea definition characterized by a >3% oxygen desaturation or an arousal (AHI3%A) is associated with CVD/CHD. Methods: Data were analyzed from 6307 Sleep Heart Health Study participants who had polysomnography. Self-reported CVD included angina, heart attack, heart failure, stroke or previous coronary bypass surgery or angioplasty. Self-reported CHD included the aforementioned conditions but not stroke or heart failure. The association between OSA and CVD/CHD was examined using logistic regression models with stepwise inclusion of demographic, anthropometric, social/behavioral and co-morbid medical conditions. A parsimonious model in which diabetes and hypertension were excluded because of their potential to be on the causal pathway between OSA and CVD/CHD also was constructed. Results: For CVD, the odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for AHI3%A >30/hour were 1.39 (1.03-1.87) and 1.45 (1.09-1.94) in the fully adjusted and parsimonious models. Results for CHD were 1.29 (0.96-1.74) and 1.36 (0.99-1.85). In participants without OSA according to more stringent AHI4% criteria but with OSA using the AHI3%A definition, similar findings were observed. Conclusion: OSA defined using an AHI3%A is associated with both CVD and CHD. Use of a more restrictive AHI4% definition will misidentify a large number of individuals with OSA who have CVD or CHD. These individuals may be denied access to therapy, potentially worsening their underlying CVD or CHD.","Quan, S. F.; Budhiraja, R.; Javaheri, S.; Parthasarathy, S.; Berry, R. B.",,575,10

Evidence-based policy would then require severe mental illness to be included in the list of risk comorbidities. Yet several sources of bias may have caused the risks associated with severe mental illness to be overlooked by most countries. Mental disorders are often not included as predictors in COVID-19 outcome studies. Studies specifically investigating the risks of psychiatric comorbidity have not yet been summarized in systematic reviews or meta-analyses and were therefore ignored by some national strategies and mathematical models. In summary, European countries' vaccination strategies try to balance ethical and scientific evidence, but for individuals with severe mental illness an evidence policy disconnect remains. Most of these patients are treated in the community, and are currently overlooked by the majority of European COVID-19 vaccination strategies.

Materials and Methods: We included 187 patients with COVID-19 between 11 March-10 May 2020. The CONUT and PNI scores were calculated using the laboratory results. The groups were divided into survival and in-hospital mortality Results: The mean age of the patients was 66.2 +/- 15.8 years (55.3% male). The mortality rate was 20.8% (n=39). The median PNI scores was significantly lower and the median CONUT score was significantly higher in the mortality group. Multivariate regression analysis showed that PNI and CONUT were independent predictors of mortality. ROC curve analyses showed that CONUT had a better performance than PNI to predict in-hospital mortality. Conclusion: In COVID-19 patients, CONUT and PNI scores were independently associated with in-hospital mortality, with CONUT presenting a better performance than PNI.","Yildirim, A.; Abacioglu, O.

We find that, indeed, training models on standard relevance ranking datasets like MS MARCO passage - -which have been curated to contain mostly credible information - -yields models that might also promote harmful misinformation. To rectify this, we propose a label prediction technique that can separate helpful from harmful content. Our design leverages pretrained sequence-to-sequence transformer models for both relevance ranking and label prediction.

Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the gold standard modality for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. In adults, chest CT is performed as an adjunct for identifying suspected COVID-19 cases along with patients' management and follow-up. However, CT findings in COVID-19 children studies have shown a diverse incidence of abnormal CT and finding patterns that made CT scan necessity to have remained controversial. The aim of the present review was to comprehensively determine the imaging findings of chest CT scans of confirmed COVID-19-infected pediatric patients through a systematic review of the available published studies. Methods: A systematic literature search was performed in the PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science core collection databases (four databases including SSCI, SCIE, AHCI, and ESCI) to find original articles containing chest CT findings in children with COVID-19 through May 7, 2021. This review included 81 articles published in English that in total included 3,557 pediatric patients Results: This review included 81 articles published in English that in total included 3,557 pediatric patients. Among the total confirmed coronavirus-infected cases (via RT-PCR test), two-thirds had abnormal chest CT findings;among these patients, 549 (37.8%) had bilateral lung involvement, and 475 (32.7%) had unilateral disease. Regarding the types of lung lesions, ground glass opacities were observed in 794 (54.7%) of patients, and consolidation was observed in 10.2%;moreover, halo sign, discrete pulmonary nodules, interstitial abnormalities or reticulations, and vascular thickening shadows were reported in 7.4%, 2.6%, 9.7% and 1.7% of the patients, respectively. Discussion: This review revealed that chest CT scan manifestations in majority of COVID-19 positive children are mild, so regarding the risk of radiation exposure, it is reasonable to confine CT scan to individual cases that its benefits outweigh the risks.","Ebrahimpour, L.; Marashi, M.; Zamanian, H.; Abedi, M.",Quantitative Imaging in Medicine and Surgery,575,1

Vitamin D deficiency has been recently reported to interfere with the prognosis of COVID-19 (2,3). Objectives: The aim of this study was to correlate the 25OH-vitamin D serum levels with lung involvement and disease severity, in a cohort of elderly patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Methods: Sixty-five COVID-19 patients (mean age 76±13 years) and sixty-five sex-and age-matched control subjects (CNT) were included in the study. Respiratory parameters (PaO2, SO2, PaCO2, PaO2/FiO2), clinical and laboratory parameters (including 25OH-vitamin D, D-dimer, C-reactive protein) and type of radiological pulmonary involvement were collected at hospital admission. Statistical analysis was performed by non-parametric tests. Results: Vitamin D sufficiency (≥30 ng/ml), insufficiency (between 20 and 30 ng/ ml), deficiency (between 10 and 20 ng/ml) and severe deficiency (<10 ng/ml) were observed respectively in 11, 11, 21 and 57 % of COVID-19 patients. Vitamin D serum levels were found significantly lower in COVID-19 patients than in CNT (median 8 vs 16 ng/ml, p=0.001). A statistically significant positive correlation was observed between vitamin D serum levels and SO2 (p=0.05), PaO2 (p=0.03), PaO2/FiO2 (p=0.02). A statistically significant negative correlation was found between vitamin D serum levels and severity of radiologic pulmonary involvement: vitamin D was significantly lower in COVID-19 patients with either diffuse/ severe interstitial lung involvement (p=0.05) or multiple lung consolidations (p=0.0001) than in those with mild radiological lung involvement. Significantly lower vitamin D serum levels were found in COVID-19 patients who died during hospitalization, compared to those who survived (median 3 vs 8 ng/ml, p=0.05). Finally, a statistically significant negative correlation was found between vitamin D serum levels and D-dimer (p=0.04), C-reactive protein (p=0.04) and disease duration (p=0.05). Conclusion: This study confirms that severe vitamin D deficiency is associated with more severe lung involvement, longer disease duration and risk of death in elderly COVID-19 patients.","Sulli, A.; Gotelli, E.; Casabella, A.; Grosso, M.; Schenone, C.; Pizzorni, C.; Paolino, S.; Alessandri, E.; Smith, V.; Cutolo, M.",Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases,575,13

The realtime accurate and predictive model of the number of infected cases could help inform the government of providing medical assistance and public health decision-making. This work is to model the ongoing COVID-19 spread in Thailand during the 1st and 2nd phases of the pandemic using the simple but powerful method based on the model-free and time series regression models. By employing the curve fitting, the model-free method using the logistic function, hyperbolic tangent function, and Gaussian function was applied to predict the number of newly infected patients and accumulate the total number of cases, including peak and viral cessation (ending) date. Alternatively, with a significant time-lag of historical data input, the regression model predicts those parameters from 1-day-ahead to 1-month-ahead. To obtain optimal prediction models, the parameters of the model-free method are fine-tuned through the genetic algorithm, whereas the generalized least squares update the parameters of the regression model. Assuming the future trend continues to follow the past pattern, the expected total number of patients is approximately 2,689 - 3,000 cases. The estimated viral cessation dates are May 2, 2020 (using Gaussian function), May 4, 2020 (using a hyperbolic function), and June 5, 2020 (using a logistic function), whereas the peak time occurred on April 5, 2020. Moreover, the model-free method performs well for long-term prediction, whereas the regression model is suitable for short-term prediction. Furthermore, the performances of the regression models yield a highly accurate forecast with lower RMSE and higher R2 up to 1-week-ahead.

Further, the understanding of feedback has changed from information about a performance directed to the learner performing the task, to a dialogue, which enables the learner to act and develop. In health professional education, feedback is a complex interaction between trainee, supervisor and the healthcare system. Most published research on feedback in health professional education originates in Europe and North America. Our interest is on the impact of culture on this process, particularly in the context of Asian cultures. A realist approach looks at complex interventions in social situations, and so would seem appropriate lens to use to examine the influence of cultural factors on utilising feedback. Methods: An initial search has been performed to define the scope of the review question and develop our candidate / best guess program theory. The formal electronic search was carried out in February 2020 and included: CINAHL, ERIC, MEDLINE, and PsycInfo, and repeated in October 2020. Retrieved articles were imported into Covidence for screening and data extraction, after which components of the Context -Mechanisms - Outcomes configurations will be sought to refine the initial program theory. Discussion: Feedback has been recognised as critically important in competency-based health professional education, yet feedback is a complex, socially based intervention. Most of the published literature on feedback originates from Western cultures. This protocol aims to provide further information that may lead to improving the usefulness of feedback in the South East Asian region.

While PE is observed in ~40% of patients with documented DVT, there is limited biomarkers that can help identifying patients at high PE risk. To fill this need, we implemented a two hidden-layers artificial neural networks (ANN) on 376 antibodies and 19 biological traits measured in the plasma of 1388 DVT patients, with or without PE, of the MARTHA study. We used the LIME algorithm to obtain a linear approximate of the resulting ANN prediction model. As MARTHA patients were typed for genotyping DNA arrays, a genome wide association study (GWAS) was conducted on the LIME estimate. Detected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were tested for association with PE risk in MARTHA. Main findings were replicated in the EOVT study composed of 143 PE patients and 196 DVT only patients. The derived ANN model for PE achieved an accuracy of 0.89 and 0.79 in our training and testing sets, respectively. A GWAS on the LIME approximate identified a strong statistical association peak (p = 5.3x10-7) at the PLXNA4 locus, with lead SNP rs1424597 at which the minor A allele was further shown to associate with an increased risk of PE (OR = 1.49 [1.12 - 1.98], p = 6.1x10-3). Further association analysis in EOVT revealed that, in the combined MARTHA and EOVT samples, the rs1424597-A allele was associated with increased PE risk (OR = 1.74 [1.27 - 2.38, p = 5.42x10-4) in patients over 37 years of age but not in younger patients (OR = 0.96 [0.65 - 1.41], p = 0.848).

People with hearing loss regularly experience difficulties interacting in everyday conversations. These difficulties in communication can result in a person with hearing loss withdrawing from social situations and becoming isolated. While hearing health loss research has largely deployed quantitative methods to investigate various aspects of the condition, qualitative research is becoming more widespread. Grounded theory is a specific qualitative methodology that has been used to establish novel theories on the experiences of living with hearing loss. Method and analysis: The aim of this systematic review is to establish how grounded theory has been applied to investigate the psychosocial aspects of hearing loss. Methods are reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 checklist. Studies included in this review will have applied grounded theory methodology. For a study to be included, it can apply grounded theory as an overarching methodology, or have grounded theory methodology embedded amongst other methodologies. These studies can be in the form of retrospective or prospective studies, before and after comparison studies, RCTs, non-RCTs, cohort studies, prospective observational studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies, and mixed method studies. Purely quantitative studies, studies that have not applied grounded theory methodology, articles reporting expert opinions, case reports, practice guidelines, case series, conference abstracts, and book chapters will be excluded. Studies included will have adult participants ([≥]18 years) who are either people with an acquired hearing loss, their family and friends (communication partners), or audiologists. The quality of application of grounded theory in each study will be assessed using the Guideline for Reporting and Evaluating Grounded Theory Research Studies (GUREGT). Ethics and dissemination: As only secondary data will be used in this systematic review, ethical approval is not required. No other ethical issues are foreseen. The International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (http://www crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO) holds the registration record of this systematic review. Findings will be disseminated via peer reviewed publications and at relevant academic conferences. Findings may also be published in relevant professional and third sector newsletters and magazines as appropriate. Data will inform future research and guideline development. Prospero registration number: PROSPERO CRD42019134197 Strengths and limitations of this study: This systematic review is the first to provide a comprehensive critique of the use of grounded theory to investigate hearing loss. The search strategy was formed in collaboration with an information specialist at the University of Nottingham. The PRISMA-P guidelines have directed the considerations and layout of this protocol. Because experiences and articulations of hearing loss are influenced by age, only adult ([≥]18 years) participants (people with hearing loss, communication partners, audiologists) will be considered. The search will not include grey literature. The studies included will only have samples of individuals with hearing loss, rather than full deafness.","Ali, Y. H.

Different sections of the society have been impacted, some more than others. In the context of India, which has a sizeable number of people living in adversity, the impact of COVID-19 has been more pronounced in the sub-section of ‘migrant workers’. Due to the imposed lockdowns to contain the spread of the coronavirus, these workers have lost their jobs and the insecurity has led them to return to their home villages in arduous conditions. Their plight is showcased here which also exposes the role of the government which has been largely indifferent and reactionary at best.

Compared with younger patients, older individuals experience impaired recovery and worse clinical outcomes after severe viral infections, including influenza and the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Whether age is a key determinant of Treg cell pro-repair function following lung injury remains unknown. Here, we show that aging results in a cell-autonomous impairment of reparative Treg cell function following experimental influenza pneumonia. Transcriptional and DNA methylation profiling of sorted Treg cells provide insight into the mechanisms underlying their age-related dysfunction, with Treg cells from aged mice demonstrating both loss of reparative programs and gain of maladaptive programs. Novel strategies that restore youthful Treg cell functional programs could be leveraged as therapies to improve outcomes among older individuals with severe viral pneumonia.","Morales-Nebreda, Luisa; Helmin, Kathryn A.; Markov, Nikolay S.; Piseaux, Raul; Acosta, Manuel A.

A Case Report.,16.471478,8.883233,2021,"Background Populations affected by humanitarian crises experience high burdens of acute respiratory infections (ARI), potentially driven by risk factors for severe disease such as poor nutrition and underlying conditions, and risk factors that may increase transmission such as overcrowding and the possibility of high social mixing. However, little is known about social mixing patterns in these populations. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional social contact survey among internally displaced people (IDP) living in Digaale, a permanent IDP camp in Somaliland. We included questions on household demographics, shelter quality, crowding, travel frequency, health status, and recent diagnosis of pneumonia, and assessed anthropometric status in children. We calculated age-standardised social contact matrices to assess population mixing, and conducted regression analysis on risk factors for recent self-reported pneumonia. Results We found crowded households with high proportions of recent self-reported pneumonia (46% in children). 20% of children younger than five are stunted, and crude death rates are high in all age groups. ARI risk factors are common, but we did not find any significant associations with self-reported pneumonia. Participants reported around 10 direct contacts per day. Social contact patterns are assortative by age, and physical contact rates are very high (78%). Conclusions ARI risk factors are very common in this population, while the large degree of contacts that involve physical touch could further increase transmission. Such IDP settings potentially present a perfect storm of risk factors for ARIs and their transmission, and innovative approaches to address such risks are urgently needed.","van Zandvoort, K.; Bobe, M.

Phylogeography plays a major role in infectious disease surveillance, viral epidemiology and vaccine design. When conducting viral phylogeographic studies, researchers require the location of the infected host of the virus, which is often present in public databases such as GenBank. However, the geographic metadata in most GenBank records is not precise enough for many phylogeographic studies; therefore, researchers often need to search the articles linked to the records for more information, which can be a tedious process. Here, we describe two approaches for automatically detecting geographic location mentions in articles pertaining to virus-related GenBank records: a supervised sequence labeling approach with innovative features and a distant-supervision approach with novel noise- reduction methods. Evaluated on a manually annotated gold standard, our supervised sequence labeling and distant supervision approaches attained F-scores of 0.81 and 0.66, respectively.","Weissenbacher, Davy; Sarker, Abeed; Tahsin, Tasnia; Scotch, Matthew; Gonzalez, Graciela",AMIA Jt Summits Transl Sci Proc,575,12

High biostatic and biocidal effects of modified nonwovens with biocides were tested against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) bacteria. Nonwovens modified with a biocide on a bentonite carrier showed an opposite reaction to a biocide on a perlite. The research also showed that 10% concentration of a biocidal agent on a perlite carrier was sufficient to inhibit the growth of bacteria (100% reduction) placed in the structure of a filtering material during normal use of RPD. A comparison of the biological activity of 2 filtering materials, each containing 10% of a perlite and produced in a laboratory and industrial conditions, showed no statistically significant differences.","Majchrzycka, Katarzyna; Gutarowska, Beata; Brochocka, Agnieszka; Brycki, Bogumił",International journal of occupational safety and ergonomics : JOSE,575,27

The aim of this report is to describe the clinical profiles of these Covid-19 infected patients admitted in Sawai Mansingh Hospital(S.M.S), Jaipur ranging from their age, sex, travel history, clinical symptoms, laboratory evaluation, radiological characteristics, treatment provided along with common side effects and the final outcome. The described cases are one of the earliest cases of Covid-19 in the Indian subcontinent. Methods Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and treatment and outcomes data were obtained with data collection forms from electronic medical records and history given by 21 Covid-19 infected patients admitted in S.M.S., Jaipur. Patients were tested for Covid-19 by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay of 2019-nCoVRNA. Results and Discussion During the course of this study 21 Covid-19 positive patients were admitted in S.M.S Hospital, Jaipur. Male patients constituted 66.66% of total patients and majority of the patients (80.90%) were below 60 years of age. Most of the patients (71.40%) were either foreigners or had a history of foreign travel suggesting that these cases were not community acquired except for 4 cases from textile producing district Bhilwara (known as Manchester of India), an epicenter of North India. Approximately 33.33% patients were completely asymptomatic and of those who were symptomatic cough was the most common symptom (85.71%) followed by fever (78.57%), myalgia (64.28%), headache (28.57%) and dyspnea (28.57%). Three patients (14.28 %) had underlying co morbidity in the form of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, chronic kidney disease or coronary artery disease. 11 patients (52.38%) had lymphopenia in their hemogram during the course of admission. 3 patients (14.28%) had leucocytosis and 4 patients (19.04%) presented with thrombocytopenia. All 4 patients in the severe category had raised FDP, D-Dimer levels and they needed oxygen support. These patients had deranged liver functions and had elevated pro-calcitonin levels, serum ferritin levels and LDH levels. 1 out of the these 4 cases went into ARDS during the course of treatment. 10 patients yielded negative results for Covid-19. The mean duration from admission to getting 1st Covid-19 sample negative was 8.3 days. 18 patients (85.71%) are still under treatment. Conclusion Clinical investigations in initial Covid-19 patients in the Indian subcontinent reveal lymphopenia as predominant finding in hemogram. Patients with older age and associated comorbid conditions (COPD and diabetes) seem to have greater risk for lung injury thereby requiring oxygen support during the course of disease and these patients also had greater derangement in their biochemical profile.","Bhandari, Sudhir; Bhargava, Abhishek; Sharma, Shrikant; Keshwani, Prakash; Sharma, Raman; Banerjee, Subrata",The Journal of the Association of Physicians of India,575,1

Single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy (SILC) is a technique that has been shown to be safe and feasible, but this appears to be the case only for experienced surgeons. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of minimally invasive surgery fellow participation during SILC. METHODS We reviewed data from our experience with SILC during 3 years. The cases were divided in two groups: group 1 comprised procedures performed by the main attending without the presence of the fellow, and group 2 comprised procedures performed with the fellow present during the operation. Demographic characteristics, comorbidities, indication for surgery, total surgical time, hospital length of stay, and complications were evaluated. RESULTS The cohort included 229 patients: 142 (62%) were included in group 1 and 87 (38%) in group 2. No differences were found in demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and indication for surgery between groups. The total surgical time was 34.4 ± 11.4 minutes for group 1 and 46.8 ± 16.0 minutes for group 2 (P < .001). The hospital length of stay was 0.89 0.32 days for group 1 and 1.01 ± 0.40 days for group 2 (P = .027). No intraoperative complications were seen in either group. There were 3 postoperative complications (2.1%) in group 1 and none in group 2 (P = .172). CONCLUSION Adoption of SILC during an established fellowship program is safe and feasible. A longer surgical time is expected during the teaching process.","Romero, Rey Jesús; Arad, Jonathan Kirsch; Kosanovic, Radomir; Lamoureux, Julie; Gonzalez, Anthony Michael",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,575,30

The protein is a minor virion structural component that plays an important, not fully understood role in virus production. It was recently demonstrated that the protein forms ion channels. We investigated the importance of the hydrophobic domain of the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) A59 E protein. Alanine scanning insertion mutagenesis was used to examine the effect of disruption of the domain on virus production in the context of the virus genome by using a MHV A59 infectious clone. Mutant viruses exhibited smaller plaque phenotypes, and virus production was significantly crippled. Analysis of recovered viruses suggested that the structure of the presumed alpha-helical structure and positioning of polar hydrophilic residues within the predicted transmembrane domain are important for virus production. Generation of viruses with restored wild-type helical pitch resulted in increased virus production, but some exhibited decreased virus release. Viruses with the restored helical pitch were more sensitive to treatment with the ion channel inhibitor hexamethylene amiloride than were the more crippled parental viruses with the single alanine insertions, suggesting that disruption of the transmembrane domain affects the functional activity of the protein. Overall the results indicate that the transmembrane domain plays a crucial role during biogenesis of virions.","Ye, Ye; Hogue, Brenda G",Journal of virology,575,20

Literally millions of premature deaths have been prevented, and countless more children have been saved from disfiguring illness. While vaccinations carry unavoidable risks, the medical, social and economic benefits they confer have led all fifty states to enact compulsory childhood vaccination laws to stop the spread of preventable diseases. Today, however, vaccines are becoming a victim of their success--many individuals have never witnessed the debilitating diseases that vaccines protect against, allowing complacency toward immunization requirements to build. Antivaccination sentiment is growing fast in the United States, in large part due to the controversial and hotly disputed link between immunizations and autism. The internet worsens fears regarding vaccination safety, as at least a dozen websites publish alarming information about the risks of vaccines. Increasing numbers of parents are refusing immunizations for their children and seeking legally sanctioned exemptions instead, apparently fearing vaccines more than the underlying diseases that they protect against. A variety of factors are at play: religious and philosophical beliefs, freedom and individualism, misinformation about risk, and overperception of risk. State legislatures and health departments now face a difficult challenge: respecting individual rights and freedoms while also safeguarding the public welfare. Nearly all states allow vaccination exemptions for religious reasons and a growing number provide ""philosophical"" opt-outs as well. However, in all but a handful of jurisdictions, neither objection is seriously documented or verified. Often, the law requires a parent to do no more than simply check a box indicating she does not wish her child to receive immunizations. The problem is exacerbated by financial incentives schools have to encourage students to opt out of vaccinations. The rise in parents opting out has caused the AMA grave concern, with many experts decrying the rise of so-called ""exemptions of convenience."" In some areas, nearly one out of five children have not received their recommended vaccines. The consequences are serious not only for those unprotected children, but for the rest of society as well. ""Herd immunity"" is threatened as more and more parents free ride off of the community's dwindling immunity, and outbreaks of diseases thought to have been conquered have already occurred. Lawsuits against vaccine manufacturers threaten them with bankruptcy, costs are being externalized onto the healthcare and legal systems, and vulnerable populations are suffering harm or even death. In the interests of social welfare, state legislatures and health departments should consider methods to ensure that the exemption process is carefully tailored to prevent check-the-box opt-outs of convenience, while still allowing exemptions for those with earnest and informed convictions or medical reasons.","Calandrillo, Steve P",University of Michigan journal of law reform.

Treatment of severe viral hepatitis by hemoperfusion was initially adopted in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Following 10 years of development in China, a plasma exchange (PE)-centered artificial liver support system (ALSS), principally dependent on PE technology was developed. Based on the condition and symptoms of each patient, PE was given alone, or combined with hemodialysis, hemofiltration, hemodiafiltration, hemoperfusion, or plasma perfusion. In the late 1990s, training courses for ALSS were developed, and ALSS began to be carried out across China. Guidelines for artificial liver therapy were formulated and published by the Artificial Liver and Liver Failure Group of the Chinese Society of Infection. In recent years, new methods have been attempted, including small pore-size plasma separators, a molecular adsorbent-based recirculating system (MARS), and a continuous albumin purification system (CAPS). According to a retrospective analysis published in 2004, ALSS therapy significantly (P < 0.001) improved the survival rate of patients with severe hepatitis compared with patients who received only medicines (43.4%, 157/362 vs. 15.4%, 55/358 in chronic patients and 78.9%, 30/38 vs. 11.9%, 5/42 in acute and subacute patients). Furthermore, ALSS has also proved valuable as a bridge to liver transplantation in the treatment of patients with end-stage severe hepatitis in China. More recently, ALSS has been used in the treatment of drug-induced liver failure, acute fatty liver during pregnancy, and other difficult-to-treat disorders in China.","Li, Lan Juan; Zhang, Yi Min; Liu, Xiao Li; Du, Wei Bo; Huang, Jian Rong; Yang, Qian; Xu, Xiao Wei; Chen, Yue Mei","Therapeutic apheresis and dialysis : official peer-reviewed journal of the International Society for Apheresis, the Japanese Society for Apheresis, the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy",575,4

The objective of this review was to identify the incidence of smell and taste dysfunction in COVID-19, determine the onset of their symptoms and the risk factors of anosmia, hyposmia, ageusia or dysgeusia for COVID-19 infection. METHODS We searched the PubMed and Google Scholar on 15th May 2020, with search terms including SARS-COV-2, coronavirus, COVID-19, hyposmia, anosmia, ageusia and dysgeusia. The articles included were cross sectional studies, observational studies and retrospective or prospective audits, letters to editor and short communications that included a study of a cohort of patients. Case reports, case-series and interventional studies were excluded. DISCUSSION A total of 16 studies were selected. Incidence of smell and taste dysfunction was higher in Europe (34 to 86%), North America (19 to 71%) and the Middle East (36 to 98%) when compared to the Asian cohorts (11 to 15%) in COVID-19 positive patients. Incidence of smell and taste dysfunction in COVID-19 negative patients was low in comparison (12 to 27%). Total incidence of smell and taste dysfunction from COVID-19 positive and negative patients from seven studies was 20% and 10% respectively. Symptoms may appear just before, concomitantly, or immediately after the onset of the usual symptoms. Occurs predominantly in females. When occurring immediately after the onset of the usual symptoms, the median time of onset was 3.3 to 4.4 days. Symptoms persist for a period of seven to 14 days. Patients with smell and taste dysfunction were reported to have a six to ten-fold odds of having COVID-19. CONCLUSION Smell and taste dysfunction has a high incidence in Europe, North America, and the Middle East. The incidence was lower in the Asia region. It is a strong risk factor for COVID-19. It may be the only symptom and should be added to the list of symptoms when screening for COVID- 19.","Wong, D K C; Gendeh, H S; Thong, H K; Lum, S G; Gendeh, B S; Saim, A; Salina, H",The Medical journal of Malaysia,575,17

Content Validity Index (CVI) and Content Validity Ratio (CVR) were calculated for the analysis of content validity. A pilot study was carried out with 60 workers from 17 companies performing analysis of Cronbach's α to assess the internal consistency or reliability. RESULTS A total of 518 workers from 51 Spanish companies in which there is exposure to biological agents participated in the study yielding a response rate of 90%. The final questionnaire obtained a Cronbach's α > 0.759 with a stable test-retest result. The questionnaire validation demonstrates that it could be used to evaluate the biological risks and help the prevention of occupational accidents and diseases. DISCUSSION This study has validated the need to evaluate worker's perception against occupational risks, as well as the application of prevention methods and protective equipment. It is a first step towards developing an occupational biohazards assessment method including all the requirements set by the European Health and Safety Strategy 2013-2020.","Aguilar-Elena, Raúl; Campo-Barrio, Alberto; Morchón, Rodrigo; Martínez-Merino, Víctor",International journal of occupational safety and ergonomics : JOSE,575,19

However, there is a paucity of data on patients' and nurses' abilities and perspectives on MDI with spacer for the treatment of acute airway obstruction during such an outbreak. METHODS We evaluated 50 consecutive MDI-with-spacer treatments administered in the respiratory wards of the National University Hospital of Singapore, and interviewed the patients after each treatment during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We also conducted interviews with 50 nurses who had experience in administering bronchodilators via both nebulizer and MDI with spacer. RESULTS Forty-six patients (92%) were able to use MDI with spacer effectively. Sixteen percent of the patients preferred nebulizer over MDI with spacer. Fifty-eight percent of the patients thought MDI with spacer was easier to use than nebulizer, and 34% thought MDI was as easy to use as nebulizer. Sixteen percent of the patients thought that nebulizer was more effective than MDI with spacer in relieving their symptoms. Ninety-six percent of the nurses preferred nebulizer over MDI with spacer. Forty-two nurses (84%) thought that nebulizer was more effective for treating acute airflow obstruction in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS In the in-patient setting during an outbreak of an airborne infection, for treatment of acute airflow obstruction, MDI with spacer was acceptable and preferred by a high percentage of patients. However, a high percentage of nurses had misconceptions regarding the efficacy of and patients' ability to use MDI with spacer.","Khoo, See Meng; Tan, Lian Kheng; Said, Nora; Lim, T K",Respiratory care,575,13

Yet during the last three decades the pattern of suicide attempts has shown some differentiations, which point to possible changes in family structure and social behavior, bringing the pattern closer to that of western countries. While in 1971-72 the ratio of male to female attempters was 1:4.6, in 1994-96 it was 1:2.3 - the mean age rose from early to middle adulthood - more married people attempted suicide than before - more attempters took alcohol before the act etc. There are, nevertheless, many steady features, e.g. the low rates of attempters in old age (above 65 years: 7.9% of the total), the methods used, the type of preceding stressful life events (more financial than emotional in males), no drug abuse etc. Since the low rates of suicide attempts in Greece have been attributed to cultural parameters and the close bonds in the family, psychodynamic studies were also carried out, which showed that adolescent attempters preserve the ability for outward aggression and their self-destructive act is due to other than intrapsychic factors (usually social and relational problems).","Ierodiakonou, C S; Iacovides, A; Ierodiakonou-Benou, I",Psychopathology,575,6

In 2003, highly pathogenic strains of avian influenza virus, including the H5N1 and H7N7 subtypes, again crossed from birds to humans and caused fatal disease. Direct avian-to-human influenza transmission was unknown before 1997. Have we responded to these threats by better preparing for emerging disease agents, or are we continuing to act only as crises arise?

Methods: In this retrospective study conducted at 2 large stroke centers serving Southeast Michigan, we included consecutive patients admitted to our stroke unit from 3/20/20 to 5/20/20 (COVID) and a similar epoch in 2019 (pre-COVID). We compared demographics and time metrics. Results: 247 patients with AIS were included in the tPA analysis, 167 (68%) in 2019 vs 80 (32%) in 2020. Overall mean age was 67.2, 60% male and 49% African Americans (AA). tPA was given in 13/80 in 2019 vs 17/167 patients in 2019 (16% vs 10%, p=0.143). There was no difference in tPA rates between AA and non-AA in 2020. There was a trend toward faster tPA administration in 2020 vs 2019 (median: 37.8 vs 51 min, p=0.051), significant among AA (37.8 vs 58.8 min, p=0.029). Mild/rapidly improving strokes was less frequently a tPA exclusion in 2020 vs 2019 (0% vs 10%). Delayed presentation was significantly less frequent among non-AA in 2020 vs 2019 (54% vs 66%, p=0.045) but there was a trend toward more frequent delayed presentations in AA vs non-AA in 2020 (76 vs 54%, P=0.073). 69 patients were eligible to receive MT, 42 (61%) in 2019 and 27 (39%) in 2020. Mean age was 67.9 and 36% were AA. No differences were detected between 2019 and 2020 in MT rates or time metrics. In 2020, there was a slight trend toward lower MT rates for AA vs non-AA patients (69% vs 30%, p=0.10). Conclusion: During the COVID-19 pandemic in Detroit there was a trend toward faster tPA administration compared to the same period pre-COVID, especially among AA. There was no significant difference in MT rates or time metrics. In our AA-majority city, there was a trend towards more delayed presentations and lower MT rates among AA during COVID. The reasons for these differences are yet to be determined and warrant further research.","Nour, H. A.; Affan, M.; Mohamud, A.; Haddan, Y.

Respondents were queried about their worries related to COVID-19 health consequences, demographic characteristics, known-risk factors, SPA and perceived age-based discrimination in the healthcare system. Our findings show that in addition, to sex, financial status and chronic illness, SPA and age-based discrimination in the healthcare were significant predictors of worries and explained additional 8% of the variance.

The aim of our study was to describe the prevalence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in non-critically ill patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and correlate such observations with the thromboprophylaxis received. METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of 67 patients admitted to the hospital for COVID-19 pneumonia. The diagnosis was confirmed using polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal specimens. The deep veins were examined using compression duplex ultrasonography with the transducer on B-mode. The patients were separated into two groups for statistical analysis: those receiving low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis and those receiving intermediate or complete anticoagulation treatment. Risk analysis and logistic regression were performed. RESULTS: Of the 67 patients, 57 were included in the present study after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria; 49.1% were women, and the patient mean age was 71.3 years. All 57 patients had undergone compression duplex ultrasonography. Of these 57 patients, 6 were diagnosed with DVT, for an in-hospital rate of DVT in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia of 10.5%. All the patients who had presented with DVT had been receiving low-molecular-weight heparin prophylaxis. The patients receiving prophylactic anticoagulation treatment had a greater risk of DVT (16.21%; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.28; P = .056) compared with those receiving intermediate or complete anticoagulation treatment. We also found a protective factor for DVT in the intermediate or complete anticoagulation treatment group (odds ratio, 0.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.08-0.46; P < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Non-critically ill, hospitalized patients with COVID-19 pneumonia have a high risk of DVT despite receipt of correct, standard thromboprophylaxis.","Jimenez-Guiu, Xavier; Huici-Sánchez, Malka; Romera-Villegas, Antonio; Izquierdo-Miranda, Alexandre; Sancho-Cerro, Ana; Vila-Coll, Ramon",J.

In this pandemic context, cancer patients constitute a particularly fragile population that would benefit the best from such treatments, a present unmet need. TMPRSS2 is essential for COVID-19 replication cycle and it is under androgen control. Estrogen and androgen receptor dependent cues converge on TMPRSS2 regulation through different mechanisms of action that can be blocked by the use of hormonal therapies. We believe that there is enough body of evidence to foresee a prophylactic use of hormonal therapies against COVID-19 and this hypothesis can be easily tested on cohorts of breast and prostate cancer patients who follow those regimens. In case of pandemic, if the protective effect of hormonal therapies will be proven on cancer patients, the use of specific hormonal therapies could be extended to other oncological groups and to healthy individuals to decrease the overall risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2.Given the COVID-19 coronavirus emergency, a special focus is needed on the impact of this rapidly spreading viral infection on cancer patients. Androgen receptor (AR) signaling in the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) regulation is emerging as an important determinant of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) susceptibility. In our study, we analyzed AR and TMPRSS2 expression in 17,352 normal and 9,556 cancer tissues from public repositories and stratified data according to sex and age. The emerging picture is that some patient groups may be particularly susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and may benefit from antiandrogen- or tamoxifen-based therapies. These findings are relevant to choose proper treatments in order to protect cancer patients from concomitant SARS-CoV-2 contagion and related symptoms and put forward the idea that hormonal therapies could be used as prophylactic agents against COVID-19.","Bravaccini, Sara; Fonzi, Eugenio; Tebaldi, Michela; Angeli, Davide; Martinelli, Giovanni; Nicolini, Fabio; Parrella, Paola; Mazza, Massimiliano",Cell Transplant,575,1

Thus, cells expressing ACE2, such as neurons and glial cells may act as targets and are thus vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Here, we have reviewed the neurological characteristics of COVID-19 and summarized possible mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 invasion of the CNS. COVID-19 patients have presented with a number of different neurological symptoms such as headache, dizziness, hyposmia, and hypogeusia during the course of illness. It has also been reported recently that some cases of COVID-19 have presented with concurrent acute cerebrovascular disease (acute ischemic stroke, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, cerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage), meningitis/encephalitis, acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, and acute Guillain-Barré syndrome. Furthermore, SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected in a cerebrospinal fluid specimen of a patient with COVID-19 have provided direct evidence to support the theory of neurotropic involvement of SARS-CoV-2. However, the underlying neurotropic mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 are yet to be established. SARS-CoV-2 may affect CNS through two direct mechanisms (hematogenous dissemination or neuronal retrograde dissemination) or via indirect routes. The underlying mechanisms require further elucidation in the future.","Zhou, Zhiqiang; Kang, Huicong; Li, Shiyong; Zhao, Xu",J Neurol,575,20

Across 24 languages, we find two distinct dynamic regimes: One characterizing the rise and subsequent collapse in collective attention to the initial Coronavirus outbreak in late January, and a second that represents March COVID-19-related discourse. Aggregating countries by dominant language use, we find that volatility in the first dynamic regime is associated with future volatility in new cases of COVID-19 roughly three weeks (average 22.7 $\pm$ 2.17 days) later.

Efforts are ongoing in order to test this hypothesis in clinical trials. Some studies demonstrated no evidence of efficacy, whereas in some cases results were retracted after reporting. Despite the lack of scientific validation, support for the use of these compounds continues from various influencers. At the cellular level, the lysosomotropic drug chloroquine accumulates in acidic organelles where it acts as an alkalizing agent with possible downstream effects on several cellular pathways. In this perspective, we discuss a possible modulatory role of these drugs in two shared features of neurodegenerative diseases, the cellular accumulation of aberrantly folded proteins and the contribution of neuroinflammation in this pathogenic process. Certainly, the decision on the use of chloroquine must be determined by its efficacy in the specific clinical situation. However, at an unprecedented time of a potential widespread use of chloroquine, we seek to raise awareness of its potential impact in ongoing clinical trials evaluating disease-modifying therapies in neurodegeneration.","Pedrioli, Giona; Patani, Rickie; Paganetti, Paolo",Front Neurol,575,27

L’objectif était d’analyser l’impact du confinement sur l’activité d’urgence pédiatrique dans un centre universitaire de référence situé en zone rouge, et de décrire les modes de prise en charge spécifiques. Hypothèse: L’activité chirurgicale d’urgence ainsi que les mécanismes lésionnels en orthopédie pédiatrique ont été modifiés par le confinement. Matériels et Méthodes: Tous les enfants pris en charge au bloc opératoire pour une urgence orthopédique pendant le confinement (groupe 1) ont été inclus de façon prospective, puis comparés de manière rétrospective aux patients opérés lors des mêmes périodes les 3 années précédentes. Les données démographiques et chirurgicales ont été analysées, et les circuits spécifiques instaurés ont été décrits. Résultats: Une diminution moyenne de 33,5% de l’activité a été constatée, sans modification des motifs de prise en charge. Les lésions les plus fréquentes étaient les plaies (54,3%), suivies des fractures (34,3%) et des infections (11,4%) et concernaient le membre supérieur dans 84,6% des cas. Le cadre légal était non respecté dans 9,7% des traumatismes et occasionnant principalement des fractures (55%). La prise en charge postopératoire a été modifiée durant le confinement dans 34% des cas, sans complication à ce jour. Discussion: Nos résultats ont retrouvé une diminution de l’activité d’urgence pédiatrique sans modification majeure des mécanismes lésionnels. Les accidents survenant en dehors du cadre légal sont demeurés rares (<10%), témoignant de la bonne adaptation des enfants vivant en zone urbaine. L’adaptation du parcours patient qui a été utile pendant le confinement, a été efficace, et va sans doute permettre de continuer à optimiser la prise en charge dans le futur, avec des circuits raccourcis et la télémédecine.

METHODS: Information was gathered prospectively on flexible nasoendoscopy procedures performed between March and June 2020. Patients and healthcare workers were followed up to assess for coronavirus disease 2019 development. One-sided 97.5 per cent Poisson confidence intervals were calculated for upper limits of risk where zero events were observed. RESULTS: A total of 286 patients were recruited. The most common indication for flexible nasoendoscopy was investigation of 'red flag' symptoms (67 per cent). Forty-seven patients (16 per cent, 95 per cent confidence interval = 13-21 per cent) had suspicious findings on flexible nasoendoscopy requiring further investigation. Twenty patients (7.1 per cent, 95 per cent confidence interval = 4.4-11 per cent) had new cancer diagnoses. Zero coronavirus disease 2019 infections were recorded in the 273 patients. No. 27 endoscopists (the doctors and nurses who carried out the procedures) were followed up.The risk of developing coronavirus disease 2019 after flexible nasoendoscopy was determined to be 0-1.3 per cent. CONCLUSION: The risk of coronavirus disease 2019 transmission associated with performing flexible nasoendoscopy in asymptomatic patients, while using appropriate personal protective equipment, is very low. Additional data are required to confirm these findings in the setting of further disease surges.","Kavanagh, F G; Connolly, C; Farrell, E; Callanan, D; Brinkman, D; Affendi, A; Lang, E; Sheahan, P",J Laryngol Otol,575,16

The use of web-based online-therapy has been shown to be useful to overcome caregiver's distress syndrome and further stimulate cognitive-motor recovery of SABI-patients. Our study aimed to investigate whether a systematic online Skype-therapy(OLST) may be of support in favoring global cognitive and sensory-motor recovery in SABI-patients and reducing caregiver distress. METHODS: Twenty-five SABI-subjects in inpatient regimen were provided with intensive OLST with the caregiver for 12 weeks in addition to standard neurorehabilitation. Each subject and caregiver was evaluated before and after the treatment by administering an ad hoc battery. Furthermore, 18 of 27 patients were provided with EEG recording in resting state. RESULTS: We found a significant reduction in caregiver's anxiety (p<0.0001) and burden(p<0.0001). Patients showed significant improvement in trunk control (p<0.0001), functional independence (p = 0.005), functional (p = 0.01) and global communication (p = 0.004), cognitive functioning (p = 0.001), and behavioral responsiveness (p = 0.0004). The training yielded a significant connectivity change within the fronto-centro-parietal areas in the delta frequency band (p<0.0001) and the centro-parieto-occipital areas in the alpha range (p = 0.004). DISCUSSION: OLST may be a useful and complementary treatment to optimize global cognitive and functional recovery in SABI-subjects and reduce caregivers' concerns in the Covid-era. OLST can foster cognitive-motor recovery potentially by favoring the plasticity-dependent functional recovery. Therefore, OLST could be proposed as a tool allowing social conversations also in the hospital setting.","De Luca, Rosaria; Rifici, Carmela; Pollicino, Patrizia; Di Cara, Marcella; Miceli, Sabrina; Sergi, Giuseppina; Sorrenti, Luisa; Romano, Michela; Naro, Antonino; Billeri, Luana; Lauria, Paola; Caminiti, Angelo; Bramanti, Placido; Torrisi, Michele",J Telemed Telecare,575,16

METHODS: This was an observational multi-ethnic multi-centre study in a UK cohort of 434 patients admitted and diagnosed COVID-19 positive, across six hospitals in London, UK during the second half of March 2020. RESULTS: Myocardial injury, defined as positive troponin during admission was observed in 288 (66.4%) patients. Age (OR: 1.68 [1.49-1.88], p < .001), hypertension (OR: 1.81 [1.10-2.99], p = .020) and moderate chronic kidney disease (OR: 9.12 [95% CI: 4.24-19.64], p < .001) independently predicted myocardial injury. After adjustment, patients with positive peak troponin were more likely to need non-invasive and mechanical ventilation (OR: 2.40 [95% CI: 1.27-4.56], p = .007, and OR: 6.81 [95% CI: 3.40-13.62], p < .001, respectively) and urgent renal replacement therapy (OR: 4.14 [95% CI: 1.34-12.78], p = .013). With regards to events, and after adjustment, positive peak troponin levels were independently associated with acute kidney injury (OR: 6.76 [95% CI: 3.40-13.47], p < .001), venous thromboembolism (OR: 11.99 [95% CI: 3.20-44.88], p < .001), development of atrial fibrillation (OR: 10.66 [95% CI: 1.33-85.32], p = .026) and death during admission (OR: 2.40 [95% CI: 1.34-4.29], p = .003). Similar associations were observed for admission troponin. In addition, median length of stay in days was shorter for patients with negative troponin levels: 8 (5-13) negative, 14 (7-23) low-positive levels and 16 (10-23) high-positive (p < .001).

The SARS-CoV-2 has been known to spread primarily through direct contact and respiratory droplets. However, detection of SARS-CoV-2 in stool and sewage have raised the possibility of fecal-oral mode of transmission. Currently, quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) is the only method being used for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which requires expensive instrumentation, dedicated laboratory setup, highly skilled staff, and several hours to report results. Considering the high transmissibility and rapid spread, a robust, sensitive, specific and cheaper assay for rapid SARS-CoV-2 detection is highly needed. Herein, we report a novel colorimetric RT-LAMP assay for naked-eye detection of SARS-COV-2 in clinical as well as sewage samples. Our SARS-CoV-2 RdRp-based LAMP assay could successfully detect the virus RNA in 26/28 (93%) of RT-PCR positive COVID-19 clinical samples with 100% specificity (n = 7) within 20 min. We also tested the effect of various additives on the performance of LAMP assay and found that addition of 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA) could increase the sensitivity of assay up to 101 copies of target sequence. Moreover, we also successfully applied this assay to detect SARS-CoV-2 in sewage waters collected from those areas of Lahore, a city of Punjab province of Pakistan, declared as virus hotspots by local government. Our optimized LAMP assay could provide a sensitive first tier strategy for SARS-CoV-2 screening and can potentially help diagnostic laboratories in better handling of high sample turnout during pandemic situation. By providing rapid naked-eye SARS-CoV-2 detection in sewage samples, this assay may support pandemic readiness and emergency response to any possible virus outbreaks in future.","Haque, Muhammad Farhan Ul; Bukhari, Syeda Sadia; Ejaz, Rabia; Zaman, Faheem Uz; Sreejith, Kamalalayam Rajan; Rashid, Naeem; Umer, Muhammad; Shahzad, Naveed",Virus Res,575,24

STUDY DESIGN: A prospective study comparing the results of the Panbio RAT with PCR in 4857 parallel samples collected at a SARS-CoV-2 test station in Oslo, and from COVID-19 outbreaks in six Norwegian municipalities. RESULTS: A total of 4857 cases were included in the study; 3991 and 866 cases from the test station and the outbreak municipalities, respectively. The prevalence at the test station in Oslo was 6.3 %, and the overall sensitivity of the RAT was 74 %. Increased sensitivity was observed in patients who experienced symptoms (79 %) and when considering samples with viral loads above estimated level of infectivity (84 %), while it was lower in asymptomatic persons (55 %). In the outbreak municipalities, the overall prevalence was 6.9 %, and the total sensitivity of the RAT was 70 %.

As part of global efforts to improve disease surveillance, we investigated how readily SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be detected in environmental samples collected from an isolated rural community in Spain with a high COVID-19 prevalence (6% of the population of 883 inhabitants). The first diagnosis of COVID-19-compatible symptoms in the village was recorded on March 3, 2020 and the last known active case resolved on June 5, 2020. By May 15, two months after strict movement constraints were imposed (""lockdown"") the cumulative number of symptomatic cases had increased to 53. Of those cases, 22 (41%) had been tested and confirmed by RT-PCR. On May 13 and June 5, samples were collected from high-use surfaces and clothes in the homes of 13 confirmed cases, from surfaces in nine public service sites (e.g. supermarket and petrol station), and from the wastewater of the village sewage system. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 7 of 57 (12%) samples, including three households and three public sites.

We examined the presence and temporal changes of the neutralizing activity of IgG fractions from 43 COVID-19-convalescent plasmas using cell-based assays with multiple endpoints. IgG fractions from 27 cases (62.8%) had significant neutralizing activity and moderately to potently inhibited SARS-CoV-2 infection in cell-based assays; however, no detectable neutralizing activity was found in 16 cases (37.2%). Approximately half of the patients (~ 41%), who had significant neutralizing activity, lost the neutralization activity within ~ 1 month. Despite the rapid decline of neutralizing activity in plasmas, good amounts of SARS-CoV-2-S1-binding antibodies were persistently seen. The longer exposure of COVID-19 patients to greater amounts of SARS-CoV-2 elicits potent immune response to SARS-CoV-2, producing greater neutralization activity and SARS-CoV-2-S1-binding antibody amounts. The dilution of highly-neutralizing plasmas with poorly-neutralizing plasmas relatively readily reduced neutralizing activity. The presence of good amounts of SARS-CoV-2-S1-binding antibodies does not serve as a surrogate ensuring the presence of good neutralizing activity. In selecting good COVID-19-convalescent plasmas, quantification of neutralizing activity in each plasma sample before collection and use is required.","Maeda, Kenji; Higashi-Kuwata, Nobuyo; Kinoshita, Noriko; Kutsuna, Satoshi; Tsuchiya, Kiyoto; Hattori, Shin-Ichiro; Matsuda, Kouki; Takamatsu, Yuki; Gatanaga, Hiroyuki; Oka, Shinichi; Sugiyama, Haruhito; Ohmagari, Norio; Mitsuya, Hiroaki",Sci Rep,575,16

After their initial basic training the e-tutors had regular team meetings and internal mini-training sessions to ensure their continuous professional development. The e-tutors could be ""requested"" by clinical teaching staff and then accompanied the respective course preparation and implementation as required. Results and discussion: Both clinical teachers and students perceived the student e-tutors' support to be very positive. The e-tutors described the interdisciplinarity of the team as an important learning resource and their work as an exciting and instructive task. Conclusion and outlook: Due to the positive experiences with the e-tutors, the faculty is striving to establish sustainable digital teaching and learning services in the coming semesters.","Abler, Michael; Bachmaier, Regine; Hawelka, Birgit; Prock, Stefan; Schworm, Silke; Merz, Anne-Kathrin; Keil, Stephanie",GMS J Med Educ,575,16

MIS-C is common in Hispanic and black children in Europe and North America, with few reports in East Asians. A significant portion of patients with MIS-C develop Kawasaki disease (KD)-like symptoms. Therefore, differential diagnosis is challenging, especially in East Asia, where KD is most prevalent. No Japanese cases have been reported in the literatures so far. We report a case of MIS-C in Japan with KD-like symptoms. A 9-year-old Japanese boy, who was infected with SARS-CoV2 1 month previously along with his family, was admitted to our hospital owing to fever for 6 d and erythema mainly in the groyne and pubic area. He also had conjunctivitis, strawberry tongue and diarrhoea. His laboratory findings were as follows: WBC, 12,840/µL (lymphocytes, 4%); CRP, 22.6 mg/dL, pro-calcitonin, 1.8 ng/mL (normal, <0.50 ng/mL); NT pro-BNP, 7627 pg/mL (<125 pg/mL); and troponin T, 0.14 ng/mL (<0.01 ng/mL). His cardiac function was normal. We initially diagnosed him with KD. His fever rapidly resolved with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) and there were no coronary artery lesions. Desquamation of the fingers was observed later. Finally, a history of SARS-COV2 infection, his age, atypical skin rash, elevation of markers of inflammation and heart failure and lymphopenia suggested the diagnosis of MIS-C rather than KD. Differentiation between KD and MIS-C is necessary even in Japan, especially in patients with atypical features of KD.","Fukuda, Sayaka; Kaneta, Mio; Miyake, Mayuko; Ohya, Takashi; Miyakawa, Kei; Iwamoto, Mari; Ito, Shuichi",Mod Rheumatol Case Rep,575,1

Given the role of sex and gender in viral infection and disease development, consideration of these variables in COVID-19 research appears imperative. Biological sex can modulate immunological and pharmacological responses;gender-related aspects can impact access to testing and care as well as long-term socioeconomic consequences of the pandemic. In light of these considerations, both European and national research effects have come to address the topic. In the following manuscript we draw on years of study of the incorporation of sex and gender into EU research and innovation. We highlight the supranational approach and its national trickle-down effect using the example of the Netherlands. We provide an overview of implementation steps needed to achieve a thorough incorporation of sex and gender in the research process in an intersectional manner.

Several clinical trials using previously approved drugs and drug combinations are urgently underway to improve our current situation. Unfortunately, a vaccine option is optimistically at least a year away. It is imperative that for future viral pandemic preparedness, we have a rapid screening technology for drug discovery and repurposing. The primary purpose of this research project was to evaluate the DeepNEU stem-cell based platform by creating and validating computer simulations of artificial lung cells infected with SARS-CoV-2 to enable the rapid identification of antiviral therapeutic targets and drug repurposing. The data generated from this project indicate that (a) human alveolar type lung cells can be simulated by DeepNEU (v5.0), (b) these simulated cells can then be infected with simulated SARS-CoV-2 virus, (c) the unsupervised learning system performed well in all simulations based on available published wet lab data, and (d) the platform identified potentially effective anti-SARS-CoV2 combinations of known drugs for urgent clinical study. The data also suggest that DeepNEU can identify potential therapeutic targets for expedited vaccine development. We conclude that based on published data plus current DeepNEU results, continued development of the DeepNEU platform will improve our preparedness for and response to future viral outbreaks. This can be achieved through rapid identification of potential therapeutic options for clinical testing as soon as the viral genome has been confirmed.","Esmail, Sally; Danter, Wayne R",Stem cells transl. med.

Five months prior he was hospitalized with COVID-19 and a pulmonary embolus requiring 2L/min of supplemental oxygen, enoxaparin, hydroxychloroquine and remdesivir. He was discharged home with apixaban and supplemental oxygen. He had a 10 pack-per-year history of smoking and quit fifty years ago. He had no occupational or environmental exposures associated with pulmonary fibrosis. He had no family history of connective tissue disease or pulmonary fibrosis. On physical examination, he had normal vital signs and his saturation was 100% on room air. Pertinent positive exam findings were limited to bibasilar dry crackles. There were no skin, joint, or oral findings. Pulmonary function tests showed normal lung volumes with normal spirometry and a severely decreased diffusing capacity. A CT revealed improvement of ground glass opacities with persistent subpleural reticulations and honeycombing. Notably, lung images of the lower lobes from a CT scan of the abdomen six years prior to this evaluation showed bibasilar reticulations and ground glass infiltrates. Laboratory studies were notable for an elevated ANA titer in a speckled pattern, elevated CCP and elevated anti-SSA 52 kD. Additional autoimmune serologies were negative. Given the presence of interstitial lung abnormalities (ILAs) in prior imaging and elevated autoimmune markers, he was deemed to have had an exacerbation of previously subclinical ILD caused by COVID-19. The long-term effects of the inflammatory response from COVID-19 have not been characterized. Initial data of CT scans in patients show that up to 17% develop fibrotic changes during the course of the disease. It remains to be seen whether there will be a progressive fibrotic phenotype solely attributable COVID-19 itself. This has been described during the H1N1 and SARS-COV1 outbreaks in patients who developed ARDS but is not observed in post-ARDS pulmonary fibrosis caused by other etiologies. The key to differentiating between a primary ILD rather than post-COVID-19 hinges on antecedent history. The patient's prior radiographic findings meet the research construct of interstitial lung abnormalities (ILA) which refers to patterns of increased lung density in patients with no history of ILD. When post-COVID-19 pulmonary fibrosis is observed, due diligence must be taken to determine alternate etiologies of subclinical ILD that may have been unmasked by COVID-19, rather than caused by it. It remains unclear whether SARS-CoV-2 could activate a latent autoimmunity or potentially cause a de novo autoimmune lung disease as has been suggested.","Cerro Chiang, G. C.; Zaman, T.; Noble, P.

FOs' geometrical design and material properties have been shown to influence their impact on foot biomechanics. New technologies such as 3D printing provide the potential to produce custom shapes and add functionalities to FOs by adding extra-components. RESEARCH QUESTION: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of 3D printed FOs stiffness and newly design postings on foot kinematics and plantar pressures in healthy people. METHODS: Two pairs of ¾ length prefabricated 3D printed FOs were administered to 15 healthy participants with normal foot posture. FOs were of different stiffness and were designed so that extra-components, innovative flat postings, could be inserted at the rearfoot. In-shoe multi-segment foot kinematics as well as plantar pressures were recorded while participants walked on a treadmill. One-way ANOVAs using statistical non-parametric mapping were performed to estimate the effect of FOs stiffness and then the addition of postings during the stance phase of walking. RESULTS: Increasing FOs stiffness altered frontal and transverse plane foot kinematics, especially by further reducing rearfoot eversion and increasing the rearfoot abduction. Postings had notable effect on rearfoot frontal plane kinematics, by enhancing FOs effect. Looking at plantar pressures, wearing FOs was associated with a shift of the loads from the rearfoot to the midfoot region. Higher peak pressures under the rearfoot and midfoot (up to +31.7 %) were also observed when increasing the stiffness of the FOs. SIGNIFICANCE: 3D printing techniques offer a wide range of possibilities in terms of material properties and design, providing clinicians the opportunity to administer FOs that could be modulated according to pathologies as well as during the treatment by adding extra-components. Further studies including people presenting musculoskeletal disorders are required.","Desmyttere, Gauthier; Leteneur, Sébastien; Hajizadeh, Maryam; Bleau, Jacinte; Begon, Mickael",Gait Posture,575,21

However, there has been little assessment of the safety of this practice. Therefore, we developed our own prototypes and evaluated whether they met regulatory standards. METHODS: Surgical mask prototypes were manufactured from two thickness grades of commercial sterilisation wrap. Safety was assessed in the context of regulatory standards. As it was not previously reported, we developed and performed differential pressure and synthetic blood penetration resistance experiments in accordance with official methodology. RESULTS: Bacterial filtration efficiency was comparable between sterilisation wrap and commercial surgical masks. Both prototypes met regulatory standards for synthetic blood resistance, whilst only our thinner mask fulfilled acceptable differential pressure ('breathability') thresholds. CONCLUSION: Acceptable barrier and breathability properties can be achieved with surgical masks produced from sterilisation wrap. Therefore, this may be a reasonable method to supplement stock if required. Unless there are shortages mandating alternatives, health-care workers should always use approved personal protective equipment.","Grigg, Sam E; Zampiron, Andrea; Akbaridoust, Farzan; Chandran, Dileep; Holmes, Natasha E; Johnson, Paul D R; Marusic, Ivan; Jones, Daryl",Infect.

Children with this disease are more susceptible to respiratory infections due to the limitation in mucociliary transport and anatomical disruption of the bronchial tree. SARS-CoV-2 causes COVID-19, a respiratory illness related to exacerbations of chronic pulmonary pathologies in children, such as CF and asthma. There are not enough case reports on pediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and CF, for which we share our experience. Case report: A 22-month-old male patient diagnosed with CF presented in the hospital with cough, fever, and increased respiratory work. The patient received supplemental oxygen and antibiotic and antiviral therapy. Positive results for type B influenza and RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) for SARS-CoV-2 were obtained. Due to the persistence of respiratory difficulty, high-flow therapy was initiated, with a good response. After an episode of hypoxemia, bradycardia, and increased respiratory work secondary to accumulated secretions, orotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation were performed. The patient evolved with clinical and gasometric improvement. After 10 days of in-hospital antibiotic management with adequate clinical evolution, the patient was discharged to complete oral treatment and home isolation. Conclusions: We present a case of chronic respiratory disease and SARS-CoV-2 infection with severity criteria in a pediatric patient.

Nevertheless, the associated psychological behaviors with this phenomenon are still not clearly understood. This study aims to assess the psychological antecedents of the Arab population toward COVID-19 vaccines. MethodsA cross-sectional, online study using a validated Arabic version of the 5C questionnaire was conducted through different media platforms in different Arabic-speaking countries. The questionnaire included three sections: socio-demographics, COVID-19 related questions, and the 5C scale of vaccine psychological antecedents, namely confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility. ResultsA total of 4,474 participants, 40.8% males from 13 Arab countries were included in the study. About 26.7% of participants had confidence in COVID-19 vaccination, 10.7% had complacency, 96.5% had no constraints, 48.8% had calculation and 40.4% had collective responsibility. The 5C antecedents showed variation among countries with confidence and collective responsibility being higher in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (59% and 58%, respectively), complacency and constraints were higher in Morocco (21% and 7%, respectively) and calculation was higher in Sudan (60%). Regression analysis revealed that sex, age, educational degrees, being a health care professional, getting a COVID-19 infection, having a relative infected or died from COVID-19 can affect the 5C psychological antecedents by different degrees. Conclusion and recommendationsWide variations of psychological antecedents between Arab countries exist.

A bioinformatic prediction of T cell epitopes and their restricted HLA Class I and II alleles was performed to obtain immunogenic epitopes and HLA alleles from the spike protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 virus. Also, a correlation with the predicted fatality rate of hospitalized patients in 28 states of Mexico was done. Here, we describe a set of 10 highly immunogenic epitopes, together with different HLA alleles that can efficiently present these epitopes to T cells. Most of these epitopes are located within the S1 subunit of the spike protein, suggesting that this area is highly immunogenic. A statistical negative correlation was found between the frequency of HLA-DRB1*01 and the fatality rate in hospitalized patients in Mexico.","Romero-López, José Pablo; Carnalla-Cortés, Martha; Pacheco-Olvera, Diana L; Ocampo-Godínez, Juan Moisés; Oliva-Ramírez, Jacqueline; Moreno-Manjón, Julia; Bernal-Alferes, Brian; López-Olmedo, Nancy; García-Latorre, Ethel; Domínguez-López, María Lilia; Reyes-Sandoval, Arturo; Jiménez-Zamudio, Luis",J. med. virol,575,32

To ensure reliable smartphone-based healthcare interfaces with high levels of efficacy, a system dynamics model with sustainability indicators is proposed. The focus of this paper is smartphone-based breathing monitoring systems that could possibly use breathing sounds as the data acquisition input. This can especially be useful for the self-testing procedure of the ongoing global COVID-19 crisis in which the lungs are attacked and breathing is affected. The method of investigation is based on a systems engineering approach using system dynamics modeling. In this paper, first, a causal model for a smartphone-based respiratory function monitoring is introduced. Then, a systems thinking approach is applied to propose a system dynamics model of the smartphone-based respiratory function monitoring system. The system dynamics model investigates the level of efficacy and sustainability of the system by studying the behavior of various factors of the system including patient wellbeing and care, cost, convenience, user friendliness, in addition to other embedded software and hardware breathing monitoring system design and performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, real-time response, etc.). The sustainability level is also studied through introducing various indicators that directly relate to the three pillars of sustainability. Various scenarios have been applied and tested on the proposed model. The results depict the dynamics of the model for the efficacy and sustainability of smartphone-based breathing monitoring systems. The proposed ideas provide a clear insight to envision sustainable and effective smartphone-based healthcare monitoring systems.","Faezipour, Misagh; Faezipour, Miad",Sustainability,575,16

This new and unexpected situation required a change of roles and scheduling of the rehabilitation teams. In this manuscript we describe the unexpected and urgent organizational change of the Cardio-Pulmonary Rehabilitation (CPR) service during the COVID-19 emergency in a Northern Italian rehabilitation hospital, focusing on the Respiratory Physiotherapists' (RPTs) role. A quick three-days complete reorganization of the entire hospital was needed. A COVID-19 care team including a multidisciplinary panel of physicians, nurses, and RPTs was quickly performed to manage 90 beds for post acute patients with COVID-19. Within the team, the RPTs changed their shifts, so as to be available 16h per day, 7 days out of 7. Remodelled tasks in charge of RPTs were: oxygen therapy daily monitoring, non invasive ventilation (NIV) and continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) delivery, pronation and postural changes to improve oxygenation, reconditioning with leg/arm cranking and exercises, initial and final patients' functional assessment by short-physical performance battery (SPPB) and 1-minute sit-to-stand test (1-STS) to evaluate motor conditions and exercise-induced oxygen desaturation. Three ""what-to-do"" algorithms were developed to guide: i) oxygen de-escalation by reducing inhaled fraction of oxygen (FiO2); ii) oxygenation improvement through the use of Venturi mask; iii) reconditioning and physical activity. One-hundred seventy patients were treated in one month. As main topics, RPTs have been involved in oxygen therapy management in almost a third of the admitted patients, reconditioning exercises in 60% of the cases, and initial and final functional motor capacity assessment in all patients. Details of activities performed by the RPT in one typical working day are also shown. Our reorganization has exploited the professional skills and clinical expertise of the RPTs. This re-organization can provide practical insights to other facilities that are facing this crisis, and may be a starting point for implementing post-COVID-19 rehabilitation. Future studies will have to improve and review this organization.","Simonelli, Carla; Paneroni, Mara; Fokom, Aubin Georges; Saleri, Manuela; Speltoni, Ilaria; Favero, Irene; Garofali, Francesca; Scalvini, Simonetta; Vitacca, Michele",Monaldi arch. chest dis,575,1

Una de las estrategias para el manejo es la reconversión de camas y servicios clínicos. OBJETIVOS: presentar experiencia de un equipo ginecológico en el manejo integral de pacientes no gineco-obstétricas con COVID 19, durante el mes de junio de 2020 en un hospital público de la Región Metropolitana. MÉTODOS: Estudio de corte transversal observacional, descriptivo. Se consideró el total de pacientes adultos hombres y mujeres sin patología gineco-obstétrica con COVID 19 ingresados al puerperio del Hospital Santiago Oriente, obteniéndose datos clínicos y demográficos a través del registro interno de la unidad y del sistema de información de red asistencial. RESULTADOS: Ingresaron 82 pacientes, 32 mujeres y 50 hombres, promedio de edad 64. El promedio de días de hospitalización fue 5, con diagnóstico de ingreso principal neumonía viral por COVID-19. Las comorbilidades frecuentes fueron hipertensión arterial sistémica y diabetes mellitus. La complicación más frecuente fue el tromboembolismo pulmonar agudo. Hubo una alta cobertura de entrega de información vía telefónica a familiares. De los 82 ingresos, 54 pacientes egresaron a su domicilio. El resto a otras unidades dentro de la institución, centros de menor complejidad o residencias sanitarias. Una paciente sexo femenino de 75 años fallece a causa de descompensación de patologias de base secundario a neumonia por Staphylococus aereus. En ella, se descarta la infección por COVID 19 dado tres exámenes por reacción de polimerasa en cadena negativos realizado antes y durante su hospitalización. CONCLUSIONES: Esta experiencia constituyó un desafío para todo el equipo de salud gineco-obstétrico, considerando que nos enfrentamos a otro tipo de pacientes y a una patología nueva. Los resultados médicos son promisorios, la experiencia humana y sentido de trabajo en equipo fue extraordinario.","Del Pozo, Francisca; Soto, Constanza; Véliz, Valeria; Escobar, Paula",Rev. chil. obstet. ginecol.

IO practitioners guided patients and their caregivers online in self-treatment with manual/touch, movement, and/or mind-body modalities. Narratives of both patients and IO practitioners were analyzed for systematic coding, identifying barriers and advantages of the online treatment program. RESULTS: Narratives obtained from 30 patients and eight IO-trained practitioners were examined.

This study aimed to investigate the kinetics and neutralizing activity of various Ag-specific Ab isotypes against SARS-CoV-2 in serum of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients confirmed via PCR test. We developed IgG, IgM, and IgA measurement assays for each Ag, including receptor-binding domain (RBD) of spike (S) protein, S1 domain, full-length S protein, S trimer, and nucleocapsid (N) domain, based on ELISA. The assays of the S protein for all isotypes showed high specificity, whereas the assays for all isotypes against N protein showed lower specificity. The sensitivity of all Ag-specific Ab isotypes depended on the timing of the serum collection and all of them, except for IgM against N protein, reached more than 90% at 15-21 d postsymptom onset. The best correlation with virus-neutralizing activity was found for IgG against RBD, and levels of IgG against RBD in sera from four patients with severe COVID-19 increased concordantly with neutralizing activity.

In this work, we have designed Ce doped Cu-Al layered double hydroxide (CAC-LDH) ultrathin them through a bottom-up synthesis method, and further loaded them with indocyanine green (ICG). The synthesized ICG/CAC-LDH was used as a Fenton-catalyst and photothermal agent. With the Fenton activity, the ICG/CAC-LDH nanosheets could decompose H2O2 and exhibit a low KM value (1.57 mM) and an ultra-high Vmax (4.88 × 10-6 M s-1) value. Due to the presence of oxidized metal ions, ICG/CAC-LDH could induce intracellular GSH depletion and reduce Cu2+ and Ce4+ to Cu+ and Ce3+, respectively. The generated Cu+ and Ce3+ further reacted with local H2O2 to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals (ËOH) via the Fenton reaction. Owing to the obviously enhanced absorption of ICG/CAC-LDH at 808 nm, the photothermal efficiency of ICG/CAC-LDH increased significantly compared with ICG (&#916;T = 34.7 °C vs. 28.3 °C). In vitro studies substantiate the remarkable CDT/PTT efficacy, with complete apoptosis of HepG2 cancer cells (the cell viability is less than 2%) treated with 25 µg mL-1 of ICG/CAC-LDH. Furthermore, ICG/CAC-LDH could also act as a contrast agent for cancer magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and photoacoustic imaging (PAI).

We hereby, report on the vulnerability of ozone due to COVID-19 lockdown whose levels flutter from surging to saturation in a highly polluted Indian capital, due to significant decline in anthropogenic emissions of ozone precursors. Average observed levels stabilized at 30 ppb, 12 ppb, 740 ppb, and 900 ppb for ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), carbon monoxide (CO) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) respectively during lockdown period from 27th March to 10th April 2020. The NO2, CO and VOC declined by 50 %, 37 %, 38 % respectively during the lockdown period of 2020 as compared to similar period in 2019. The anomalous response of ozone during the lockdown is explained by resolving the poorly known complex O3-NOx-VOCs mechanism with the help of data from air monitoring stations in Delhi, India.

METHODS: Protein kinase D1 expression in tumor tissues and adjacent tissues from 172 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent surgical resection were analyzed by immunohistochemical staining. Based on the total immunohistochemical score, protein kinase D1 expression was classified as protein kinase D1 high expression (further divided into protein kinase D1 high+++, protein kinase D1 high++, and protein kinase D1 high+ expressions) and protein kinase D1 low expression. Clinical characteristics of patients with non-small cell lung cancer were acquired from the database. Accumulating disease-free survival and overall survival were calculated based on patients' relapse/survival status. RESULTS: Protein kinase D1 expression was increased in tumor tissues compared to adjacent tissues (P < .001). Tumor protein kinase D1 high expression correlated with poorer pathological differentiation (P = .041), increased tumor size (P = .003), the presence of lymph node metastasis (P = .001), and elevated tumor, nodes and metastases stage (P < .001). Besides, both accumulating disease-free survival and overall survival were decreased in patients with tumor protein kinase D1 high expression compared to patients with tumor protein kinase D1 low expression (P = .010 for disease-free survival and P = 0.005 for overall survival). Moreover, they were lowest in patients with tumor protein kinase D1 high+++ expression, followed by patients with tumor protein kinase D1 high++ expression, then patients with tumor protein kinase D1 high+ expression, and highest in patients with tumor protein kinase D1 low expression (P < .001 for disease-free survival and P = .001 for overall survival). Notably, higher tumor protein kinase D1 expression was an independent predictive factor for decreased disease-free survival (P = .001) and overall survival (P = .004).

Infection by 2019-nCoV is more likely in elderly people with comor-bidities or with associated chronic diseases. Due to the high transmission rate among humans, this disease is rapidly disseminated, which led to several events being canceled, including the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games. The aim of this article is to discuss the risk factors for Olympic and Paralympic athletes, as well as for spectators, that justify the decision to postpone the Tokyo Games 2020. Regular physical exercise is associated with health and the prevention of chronic diseases. Although athletes generally appear to be healthy and physically fit, this may not be true. The immune system, which protects the organism from invasive microorganisms, can be affected by the duration and quality of sleep, as well as by physical exercise which influences the quality of the immune response. High volumes of high-intensity physical exercise, as well as changes in sleep patterns during the pre-competition period and the impacts of jet lag on athletes traveling for the Tokyo Games in 2020 may lead to immune system suppression, making these groups more vulnerable to infection by 2019-nCoV. Moreover, during the period planned for the games in 2020 the pandemic may be subsiding in some countries and increasing in others, and this was also taken into consideration as a risk factor. Hence, the decision taken to postpone the Tokyo 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games until 2021 due to the 2019-nCoV was the correct one, and was extremely important to protect the health of Olympic and Paralympic athletes, as well as spectators.

We conducted a study among the lay public in Wuhan to access their support, understanding of, compliance with, and the psychological impacts of the quarantine. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional, online-based survey study between January 28, 2020, and February 2, 2020 among the adult lay public in Wuhan to access their support, understanding of, compliance with, and the psychological impacts of the quarantine. Multivariable logistic analysis was used to identify factors associated with psychological impacts. RESULTS: Among the 4100 participants investigated, a total of 15.9% were compliant with all the five household prevention measures, whereas 74.4% were compliant with all the three community prevention measures investigated. By demographics, participants of younger age, higher income, residing in an urban area, knowing neighbors infected with COVID-19 reported significantly higher psychological impact score. Participants with a lower level of support for quarantine were more likely to have a higher psychological impact score (OR = 1.45, 95% CI 1.07-1.96). Participants with a lower level of compliance with preventive measures (score of 0-19) reported higher psychological impact (OR = 1.40, 95% CI 1.22-1.60 vs. score 20-24). Participants who had been out of house socializing and attended public events expressed higher psychological impact. CONCLUSIONS: Support, understanding of the rationale for quarantine are essential in ensuring appropriate psychological well-being during the quarantine. Improvements in compliance with preventive measures are highly warranted and may bring about a reduction in psychological distress.","Lin, Yulan; Hu, Zhijian; Alias, Haridah; Wong, Li Ping",J Psychosom Res,575,13

Serological tests can be employed for RT-PCR negative patients, contact tracing, determining the probability of protection against re-infection, and seroepidemiological studies. AREAS COVERED: The main methodologies of serology-based tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2 including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), chemiluminescent immunoassays (CLIAs) and lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) were reviewed and their diagnostic performances were compared. Herein, a literature review on the databases of PubMed, Scopus and Google Scholar between January 01, 2020 and June 30, 2020 based on the main serological methods for COVID-19 detection with the focus on comparative experiments was performed. The review was updated on 31th December 2020. EXPERT OPINION: Serology testing could be considered as a part of diagnostic panel two weeks post symptom onset. Higher sensitivity for serology-based tests could be achieved by determining combined IgG/IgM titers. Furthermore, higher sensitive serological test detecting neutralization antibody could be developed by targeting spike (S) antigen. It was also demonstrated that the sensitivity of ELISA/CLIA-based methods are higher than LFIA devices.","Mohit, Elham; Rostami, Zahra; Vahidi, Hossein",Expert rev. clin. immunol,575,16

Studies summarising COVID-19 mitigation strategies designed and implemented by radiotherapy centres in LMICs to avoid delays, deferrments and interruptions of radiotherapy services are lacking. Materials and methods: A systematic review was conducted and reported in accordance with the preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis guideline. Ovid Embase, Ovid MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched for peer-reviewed articles that reported measures adopted by radiotherapy centres in LMICs to reduce the risk of COVID-19. Information on different strategies were extracted from the included studies and textual narrative synthesis was conducted. Results: Of 60 articles retrieved, eleven were included. Majority of the studies were conducted in China. Ten of the included studies employed a qualitative design. Four themes were identified: preparing and equipping staff;reinforcing infection prevention and control policies;strengthening coordination and communication;and maintaining physical distancing. Studies reported that radiotherapy centres had: formed COVID-19 response multidisciplinary team;maximised the use of telehealth;adjusted the layout of waiting areas;divided staff into teams;dedicated a room for isolating suspected cases;and adopted triage systems. Conclusions: Local adaptation of established global strategies coupled with timely development of guidelines, flexibility and innovation have allowed radiotherapy leaders to continue to deliver radiotherapy services to cancer patients in LMICs during the COVID-19 crisis. Robust data collection must be encouraged in LMICs to provide an evidence-based knowledge for use in the event of another pandemic.","Donkor, A.; Della Atuwo-Ampoh, V.; Opie, C.; Yakanu, F.; Lombe, D.; Khader, J.",Reports of Practical Oncology and Radiotherapy,575,24

Telemedicine can effectively transfer real-time ultrasound images via video-conferencing. We report the successful introduction of a fetal ultrasound telemedicine service linking a specialist fetal medicine (FM) centre and a remote obstetric unit. METHODS: Over a four-year period from October 2015, all women referred for FM consultation from the obstetric unit were seen via telemedicine, excluding cases where invasive testing, intrauterine therapy or cardiac anomalies were anticipated. The outcomes measured included the indication for FM referral; scan duration and image and sound quality during the consultation. Women's perceptions of the telemedicine consultation and estimated costs to attend the FM centre were measured by a structured questionnaire completed following the first telemedicine appointment during the Phase 1 of the project. RESULTS: Overall, 297 women had a telemedicine consultation during Phase 1 (pilot and evaluation) and Phase 2 (embedding and adoption) of the project, which covered a 4 year period 34 women completed questionnaires during the Phase 1 of the study. Travel to the telemedicine consultation took a median (range) time of 20 min (4150), in comparison to an estimated journey of 230 min (120,450) to the FM centre. On average, women would have spent approximately £28 to travel to the FM centre per visit. The overall costs for the woman and her partner/ friend to attend the FM centre was estimated to be £439. Women were generally satisfied with the service and valued the opportunity to have a FM consultation locally. CONCLUSIONS: We have demonstrated that a fetal ultrasound telemedicine service can be successfully introduced to provide FM ultrasound of sufficient quality to allow fetal diagnosis and specialist consultation with parents. Furthermore, the service is acceptable to parents, has shown a reduction in family costs and journey times.","Smith, V J; Marshall, A; Lie, M L S; Bidmead, E; Beckwith, B; Van Oudgaarden, E; Robson, S C",BMC Pregnancy Childbirth,575,20

This study used simple demographic information available on admission to evaluate possible associations between these variables and outcomes, including mortality and length of stay. Clinical outcomes in 63 patients admitted to a tertiary care hospital in West Texas were reviewed. Older patients, patients admitted from nursing homes, and patients admitted to medical intensive care units had increased mortality. Unadjusted analysis indicated that males had increased mortality. Adjusted analysis indicated that males spent nearly 5 days longer in the hospital than females. In summary, age, chronic illness requiring nursing home placement, and acute severe illness requiring intensive care unit admission identify patients with worse prognoses. In addition, males will likely have a longer length of hospital stay.","Ali, Kiran; Rao, Sanjana; Dennis, Jeff; Berdine, Gilbert; Test, Victor; Nugent, Kenneth",J Prim Care Community Health,575,33

The lung ultrasound (LUS) is a noninvasive and easily repeatable tool and can be carried out by the pediatrician at the bedside of children with a consequent reduction in the risk of transmission of the virus. OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that ultrasound findings in these patients would (1) be associated with their disease severity and (2) change over time in alignment with clinical outcome. METHODS: The study was made in the emergency department (ED) in a tertiary level pediatric hospital. All patients with swab-confirmed COVID-19 infection were subjected to a LUS within 6 h from admission and after 96 h. RESULTS: Among a total of 30 children, 18 (60%) were males, 4 reported exertional dyspnea, and only 1 chest pain. The mean oxygen saturation was 98.8 ± 1.0% in ambient air in the ED and no patient needed oxygen therapy during hospitalization. Children with moderate disease presented more B line (p = .03). After 96 h, we had observed ultrasound abnormality only in 20% of the children. We found a statistically significant reduction in pleural irregularities (30% vs. 16.7; p = .001) and in B lines (50% vs. 20%; p = .008).

Such measures could have negative effects on the mental health of the population. The aims of this study are to (1) track the impact of COVID-19 on self-reported mood, self-rated health, other health and psychosocial indicators, and health services utilization of people who have an interRAI assessment during the first year of COVID-19; (2) compare these indicators with the same indicators in people who had an interRAI assessment in the year before COVID-19; and (3) report these indicators publicly as soon as data analysis is completed every 3 months. METHODS: interRAI COVID-19 Study (iCoS) is an observational study on routinely collected national data using the interRAI Home Care and Contact Assessment, which are standardized geriatric assessment tools mandated for all people assessed for publicly funded home support services and aged residential care in New Zealand. Based on the 2018/19 figures, we estimated there are 36,000 interRAI assessments per annum. We will compare the four post-lockdown quarters (from 25th March 2020) with the respective pre-lockdown quarters. The primary outcomes are self-reported mood (feeling sad, depressed or hopeless: 0 = no, 1 = yes) and self-rated health (0 = excellent, 1 = good, 2 = fair, 3 = poor). We will also analyze sociodemographics, other secondary health and psychosocial indicators, and health services utilization. Descriptive statistics will be conducted for primary outcomes and other indicators for each of the eight quarters. We will compare the quarters using regression models adjusted for demographic characteristics using weights or additional variables. Key health and psychosocial indicators will be reported publicly as soon as data analysis is completed for each quarter in the 12-month post-lockdown period by using a data visualization tool. DISCUSSION: This rapid translation of routinely collected national interRAI data will provide a means to monitor the health and psychosocial well-being of vulnerable older New Zealanders. Insights from this study can be shared with other countries that use interRAI and prepare health and social services for similar epidemics/pandemics in the future.","Cheung, Gary; Rivera-Rodriguez, Claudia; Martinez-Ruiz, Adrian; Ma039,; u, Etuini; Ryan, Brigid; Burholt, Vanessa; Bissielo, Ange; Meehan, Brigette",BMC Public Health,575,1

Delayed primary excision (DPE) after induction chemotherapy allows for a reduction in adjuvant radiation dose, but with the risk of potential surgical morbidity. The objectives of this study were to compare outcomes in children with group III RMS who did and did not undergo DPE and to assess surgical morbidity. METHODS: The study included 369 patients who had clinical group III RMS at sites amenable to DPE from intermediate-risk Children's Oncology Group studies D9803 (encouraged DPE) and ARST0531 (discouraged DPE). RESULTS: The primary tumor site was bladder/prostate (136 patients; 37%), extremity (97 patients; 26%), trunk (24 patients; 7%), retroperitoneum (91 patients; 25%), or intrathoracic/perineum/perianal (21 patients; 6%). In total, 112 patients (53.9%) underwent DPE in D9803, and 26 patients (16.2%) underwent DPE in ARST0531 (P < .001), with loss of vital organ or function in 30 of 138 patients (22%). DPE allowed for a reduced radiation dose in 110 of 135 patients (81%; 51% were reduced to 36 Gy, and 30% were reduced to 42 Gy). Patients who underwent DPE had improved unadjusted overall survival (P = .013). In adjusted regression analysis, the risk of death (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% CI 0.43-1.16) was similar for patients who did and did not undergo DPE and was improved for the subset of patients who had tumors of the trunk and retroperitoneum (hazard ratio, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.20-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Children with group III RMS have equivalent or improved outcomes with DPE and can receive a decreased radiation dose for definitive local control. The choice of local control modality should weigh the potential morbidity of surgery versus that of higher dose irradiation.","Lautz, Timothy B; Chi, Yueh-Yun; Li, Minjie; Wolden, Suzanne L; Casey, Dana L; Routh, Jonathan C; Granberg, Candace F; Binite, Odion; Rudzinski, Erin R; Hawkins, Douglas S; Venkatramani, Rajkumar; Rodeberg, David A",Cancer,575,16

Impaired fibrinolysis has been proposed as an underlying mechanism. Our objective was to determine if fibrinolysis stimulated by tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) differed between COVID patients and controls. Plasma from 14 COVID patients on prophylactic heparin therapy was obtained and compared with heparinized plasma from 14 different healthy donors to act as controls. Kaolin activated thromboelastography with heparinase was utilized to obtain baseline measurements and then repeated with the addition of 4 nM tPA. Baseline fibrinogen levels were higher in COVID plasma as measured by maximum clot amplitude (43.6 ± 6.9 mm vs. 23.2 ± 5.5 mm, p < 0.0001) and Clauss assay (595 ± 135 mg/dL vs. 278 ± 44 mg/dL, p < 0.0001). With the addition of tPA, fibrinolysis at 30 min after MA (LY30%) was lower (37.9 ± 16.5% vs. 58.9 ± 18.3%, p = 0.0035) and time to 50% lysis was longer (48.8 ± 16.3 vs. 30.5 ± 15.4 min, p = 0.0053) in the COVID-19 samples. Clotting times and rate of fibrin polymerization ('R' or '&#945;' parameters) were largely the same in both groups. Clot from COVID patients contains a higher fibrin content compared to standard controls and shows resistance to fibrinolysis induced by tPA.

Growing reports argue about the potential benefits of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in reducing morbidity and mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but with inconsistent results.This study aimed to assess the potential benefits of HCQ on viral conversion, reducing the need for ICU or mechanical ventilation, and its impact on mortality. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This retrospective observational study was conducted enrolling confirmed SARS-CoV2 patients. They were subjected to plain CXR (HRCT of chest if needed), routine laboratory tests for COVID-19 (including CBC, CRP, LDH, D-Dimer, ferritin, and blood sugar), ECG, and blood gases. They were allocated to either HCQ or non-HCQ groups. Both groups were followed-up for symptoms resolution, need for ICU admission, non-invasive or invasive ventilation, duration till conversion, and mortality. RESULTS: A total of 202 patients with moderate COVID-19 were enrolled with a mean age of 55.05±10.15, out of whom 80% were male patients. The most common presenting symptom was fever (87.38% in the control group versus 92% in the HCQ group), followed by cough (82.52% versus 89.9%). In total, 24.27% of patients in the control group versus 28.3% in the HCQ group deteriorated and necessitated ICU admission (p=0.52), 13.6% of the control group versus 19.2% in the HCQ group required mechanical ventilation (p=0.28), and 69.9% of the control group versus 68.9% in the HCQ group converted negative on day 7 (p=0.85).

Analysis with varying concentrations of urea allows to determine distinct differences in avidity maturation, though the total process remains at an unusually low level. Despite incomplete avidity maturation, this approach allows to define early and late stages of infection. It therefore can compensate for the recently described irregular kinetic patterns of immunoglobulin M and immunoglobulin G (IgG) directed towards SARS-CoV-2 antigens. The serological responses towards seasonal coronaviruses neither have a negative nor positive impact on SARS-CoV-2 serology in general. Avidity determination in combination with measurement of antibody titers and complexity of the immune response allows to clearly differentiate between IgG responses towards seasonal coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2. Cross-reactions seem to occur with very low probability. They can be recognized by their pattern of response and through differential treatment with urea. As high avidity has been shown to be essential in several virus systems for the protective effect of neutralizing antibodies, it should be clarified whether high avidity of IgG directed towards RBD indicates protective immunity. If this is the case, monitoring of avidity should be part of the optimization of vaccination programs.","Bauer, Georg; Struck, Friedhelm; Schreiner, Patrick; Staschik, Eva; Soutschek, Erwin; Motz, Manfred",J Med Virol,575,21

The pandemic threatens blood supply but we do not yet know its impact on blood donations or on the perceptions and expectations of donors. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study in four hospital-based blood services in Cameroon, using a survey design and focusing on the subjective and cultural aspects of donors. Using a semi-structured questionnaire, we collected the participants' responses as to their understanding of COVID-19 and of current protection measures, and their expectations. Data on trends of blood donations were collected retrospectively for the period from 1st January to 30th April 2019 and the same period in 2020. RESULTS: Of 494 donors included, 432 (87·4%) were enrolled from fixed blood collection sites and 62 (12·6%) were contacted by phone. A total of 464 (93·9%) participants believed that the COVID-19 is a lung disease, but some declared it to be imaginary (7·7%), a foreign disease (8·3%) or a blood-borne disease (3·2%). The participants reported that the distribution of face masks and hydroalcoholic solutions (92·5%), social distancing and hygiene (6·3%) are the most important measures that need to be in place for safe donation. The number of blood donations dropped by 21·5% between 2019 and 2020. CONCLUSION: Most of the donors know COVID-19, its transmission routes and manifestations.

Evidence from the COVID-19,16.396399,1.183292,2021,"Debate and scientific inquiries regarding airborne transmission of respiratory infections such as COVID-19 and influenza continue. Health authorities including the WHO and the US CDC have recognized the airborne transmission of COVID-19 in specific settings, although the ventilation requirements remain to be determined. In this work we consider the long-range airborne transmission as an extended short-range airborne route, which reconciles the link between short- and long-range airborne routes. The effective short-range distance is defined as the distance in short range at which long-range route has the same volumetric exposure value as that due to short-range route. Our data show that a decrease in ventilation rate or room volume per person, or an increase in the ratio of the number of infected to susceptible people reduces the effective short-range distance. In a normal breathing scenario with one out of five people infected and a room volume of 12 m3 per person to ensure an effective short-range distance of 1.5 m, a ventilation rate of 10 L/s per person is needed for a duration of 2 h. Our results suggest that effective environmental prevention strategies for respiratory infections require appropriate increases in the ventilation rate while maintaining a sufficiently low occupancy. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Demonstration of the long-range airborne route as an extended short-range airborne route suggests the significant role played by building ventilation in respiratory infection exposure. The reconciliation of short- and long-range airborne transmission suggests that the commonly observed dominance of close-contact transmission is a probable evidence of short-range airborne transmission, following a separate earlier study that revealed the relative insignificance of large droplet transmission in comparison with the short-range airborne-route. Existing ventilation standards do not account for respiratory infection control, and this study presents a possible approach to account for infection under new ventilation standards.","Chen, Wenzhao; Qian, Hua; Zhang, Nan; Liu, Fan; Liu, Li; Li, Yuguo",J Hazard Mater,575,16

Based on available data for the SARS-CoV-1 virus, we suggest how CoV-2 localization of RNA transcripts in mitochondria hijacks the host cell's mitochondrial function to viral advantage. Besides viral RNA transcripts, RNA also localizes to mitochondria. SARS-CoV-2 may manipulate mitochondrial function indirectly, first by ACE2 regulation of mitochondrial function, and once it enters the host cell, open-reading frames (ORFs) such as ORF-9b can directly manipulate mitochondrial function to evade host cell immunity and facilitate virus replication and COVID-19 disease. Manipulations of host mitochondria by viral ORFs can release mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the cytoplasm and activate mtDNA-induced inflammasome and suppress innate and adaptive immunity. We argue that a decline in ACE2 function in aged individuals, coupled with the age-associated decline in mitochondrial functions resulting in chronic metabolic disorders like diabetes or cancer, may make the host more vulnerable to infection and health complications to mortality. These observations suggest that distinct localization of viral RNA and proteins in mitochondria must play essential roles in SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis. Understanding the mechanisms underlying virus communication with host mitochondria may provide critical insights into COVID-19 pathologies. An investigation into the SARS-CoV-2 hijacking of mitochondria should lead to novel approaches to prevent and treat COVID-19.","Singh, Keshav K; Chaubey, Gyaneshwer; Chen, Jake Y; Suravajhala, Prashanth",Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,575,33

Attenuation typically relies on de-optimisation of codon pairs and maximization of CpG dinucleotide frequencies. So as to formulate evolutionarily-informed attenuation strategies that aim to force nucleotide usage against the direction favoured by selection, here we examine available whole-genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 to infer patterns of mutation and selection on synonymous sites. Analysis of mutational profiles indicates a strong mutation bias towards U. In turn, analysis of observed synonymous site composition implicates selection against U. Accounting for dinucleotide effects reinforces this conclusion, observed UU content being a quarter of that expected under neutrality. Possible mechanisms of selection against U mutations includes selection for higher expression, for high mRNA stability or lower immunogenicity of viral genes. Consistent with gene-specific selection against CpG dinucleotides, we observe systematic differences of CpG content between SARS-CoV-2 genes. We propose an evolutionarily-informed approach to attenuation that, unusually, seeks to increase usage of the already most common synonymous codons. Comparable analysis of H1N1 and Ebola finds that GC3 deviated from neutral equilibrium is not a universal feature, cautioning against generalization of results.","Rice, Alan M; Morales, Atahualpa Castillo; Ho, Alexander T; Mordstein, Christine; Mühlhausen, Stefanie; Watson, Samir; Cano, Laura; Young, Bethan; Kudla, Grzegorz; Hurst, Laurence D",Mol. biol. evol,575,1

We propose a mathematical framework for understanding how the emergence of new viral strains and phenotype within infected persons affects the population-level control of those infections by both non-curative treatment and chemo-prophylactic measures. We consider the within-host emergence of new strains that lack phenotype novelty and also the evolution of variability in contagiousness, resistance to therapy, and efficacy of prophylaxis. Our framework balances the need for verisimilitude with our desire to retain a model that can be approached analytically. We show how to compute the population-level basic reproduction number accounting for the within-host evolutionary process where new phenotypes emerge and are lost in infected persons, which we also extend to include both treatment and prophylactic control efforts. This allows us to make clear statements about both the global and relative efficacy of different control efforts accounting for within-host phenotypic evolution. Finally, we give expressions for the endemic equilibrium of these models for certain constrained versions of the within-host evolutionary model providing a potential method for estimating within-host evolutionary parameters from population-level genetic sequence data.","Gromov, Dmitry; Romero-Severson, Ethan O.",,575,16

METHODS: we reviewed 3D US volumes acquired transvaginally (TVUS) through the anterior fontanelle, between 14-17 weeks. The following landmarks were recognized: tela-choroidea (TC), foramina of Moro, early CC and the evolving cavum septi pellucidi. The following measurements were taken: total, anterior and posterior sections, and height of the CC (referenced to the anterior TC border). All measurements were correlated to both the gestational age and the transverse cerebellar diameter (TCD). RESULTS: Eighty nine volumes were included in the study (mean 15.1 weeks +/- 0.84, TCD range: 13.1-18.4 mm) with high inter and intra observer correlation of the measurements. We found high correlation between CC length and height, and TCD. The anterior segment of the CC appear earlier than the posterior one, and growth continues bi-directionally. Initially, the posterior elongation is significantly larger than the anterior one. Association of all CC measurements with TCD remained significant when co-varying for maternal age and fetal sex. CONCLUSIONS: imaging the fetal CC is feasible from 14 weeks by TVUS, by following the suggested insonation approach. The early CC develops bi-directionally, and the posterior elongation is more significant than the anterior one. This article is protected by copyright.

PURPOSE: Highly effective coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have brought hope for ending the pandemic. Unprecedented mass vaccination started first among healthcare workers. The aim of this report is to describe key strategies undertaken by a large hospital pharmacy department to meet the challenges of preparing a large quantity of COVID-19 vaccine doses in a short period of time.

The pharmacy department faced challenges including stringent vaccine storage requirements, a need for specific equipment and workflow, limited funding, and staffing constraints. The pharmacy department's senior leaders defined pharmacy responsibilities, budgeted for equipment, participated in vaccination center design, and instructed pharmacy informatics personnel. The vaccine coordinators were appointed to oversee all vaccination-related operations. An ultra-low temperature freezer was installed 2 weeks before arrival of the first shipment of vaccine. All pharmacy order entry tools and operating procedures were standardized, and staff training and schedules were finalized by December 15. The first dose of the vaccine was administered on December 16 at the vaccination center. Pharmacy staff members dispensed the vaccine doses and monitored patients. By January 6, 2021, MWHC had vaccinated 3,812 employees with their first vaccine dose, with an average of 228 doses administered daily. CONCLUSION: Key strategies such as systemic coordination, early preparation, detailed planning, operating procedure development, and staff education and engagement proved successful in facilitating preparation of thousands of COVID-19 vaccine doses for hospital employees within a short period of time.","Li, Quan; Norman, Sarah; Guthrie, Pauline; Gachoya, Julianna; Sebakijje, Justin; Leftridge, Zetta; Willis, Cynthia G; Kishore, Anil; Breakenridge, Margaret; Spence, Clyde",Am. j. health system pharm,575,24

This study aimed to provide an insight into mental well-being of pregnant women in Denmark during COVID-19 by assessing symptoms of depression and anxiety. METHODS: Data from two cohorts of pregnant women recruited from Danish general practice were compared. A COVID-19 lockdown cohort (N=330) completed questionnaires between 8 April and 6 May. Responses were compared to those from a control cohort of women from 2016 (N=1428). Mental well-being was measured with the Major Depression Inventory (MDI) and the Anxiety Symptom Scale (ASS). RESULTS: Questionnaires were returned by 83% of the COVID-19 lockdown cohort and by 93% of the control cohort. Multivariable analysis controlling for age, cohabitation status, occupation, smoking, alcohol use, chronic disease, fertility treatment, parity and children living at home showed no difference in depressive symptoms (MDI). Anxiety symptoms (ASS) were slightly worse in the COVID-19 lockdown cohort (mean difference=1.4 points), mainly driven by questions concerning general anxiety. The largest differences in anxiety were seen in first trimester (adjusted mean difference=4.0 points). CONCLUSIONS: Pregnant women questioned during the COVID-19 pandemic showed no change in symptoms of depression and only a modest elevation of anxiety when compared to pregnant women questioned during a non-pandemic period in 2016.","Overbeck, Gritt; Rasmussen, Ida Scheel; Siersma, Volkert; Andersen, Julie Høgsgaard; Kragstrup, Jakob; Wilson, Philip; Hauskov Graungaard, Anette; Ertmann, Ruth Kirk",Scand J Public Health,575,20

However, auscultation is a subjective practice and interpretations vary widely between users. The digitization of auscultation acquisition and interpretation is a particularly promising strategy for diagnosing and monitoring infectious diseases such as Coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19) where automated analyses could help decentralise care and better inform decision-making in telemedicine. This protocol describes the standardised collection of lung auscultations in COVID-19 triage sites and a deep learning approach to diagnostic and prognostic modelling for future incorporation into an intelligent autonomous stethoscope benchmarked against human expert interpretation. METHODS: A total of 1000 consecutive, patients aged &#8805; 16 years and meeting COVID-19 testing criteria will be recruited at screening sites and amongst inpatients of the internal medicine department at the Geneva University Hospitals, starting from October 2020. COVID-19 is diagnosed by RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab and COVID-positive patients are followed up until outcome (i.e., discharge, hospitalisation, intubation and/or death). At inclusion, demographic and clinical data are collected, such as age, sex, medical history, and signs and symptoms of the current episode. Additionally, lung auscultation will be recorded with a digital stethoscope at 6 thoracic sites in each patient. A deep learning algorithm (DeepBreath) using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Support Vector Machine classifier will be trained on these audio recordings to derive an automated prediction of diagnostic (COVID positive vs negative) and risk stratification categories (mild to severe). The performance of this model will be compared to a human prediction baseline on a random subset of lung sounds, where blinded physicians are asked to classify the audios into the same categories. DISCUSSION: This approach has broad potential to standardise the evaluation of lung auscultation in COVID-19 at various levels of healthcare, especially in the context of decentralised triage and monitoring.

Individual personality differences played a key role in perceived psychological wellbeing during the pandemic. The present exploratory study sought to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on psychological health and identify how psychological wellbeing is influenced by personality traits. A total of 2103 participants (64% female and 36% male) completed an online survey that included the Psychological General Wellbeing Index (PGWBI), the Italian Short Personality Inventory (ITAPI), and a general questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and hierarchical regressions were performed using SPSS 25.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) (The findings showed poor psychological wellbeing in the Italian population. Young people reported the lowest scores. Vulnerability traits negatively influenced some PGWBI domains, such as the total score (ß = -0.62), anxiety (ß = -0.55), depression (ß = -0.46), positivity and wellbeing (ß = -0.51), vitality (ß = -0.45), general health (ß = -0.12), and self-control (ß = -0.52). On the other hand, dynamism traits positively affected vitality (ß = 0.12) and positivity and wellbeing (ß = 0.14). In other words, personality factors related to vulnerability in particular created risk, whereas dynamism offered protection. The results highlight how COVID-19 helped to trigger anxious and depressive states. People feel helpless and vulnerable when facing new, unexpected conditions caused by the virus.

However, because of the lack of viable treatments and rapidity of spread, physicians around the world have used them in an attempt to improve survival in critically ill patients. One such drug is Tocilizumab, which was hypothesized to have a role in managing the cytokine release syndrome (“Cytokine storm”) associated with this illness. We report our experience with 2 critically ill patients with COVID-19 who received Tocilizumab and subsequently developed intestinal perforation. CASE PRESENTATION: Patient A was a 74-year-old gentleman with COVID-19 pneumonia whose hospitalization was complicated by development of adynamic ileus presumed secondary to sepsis, that was conservatively managed. Due to worsening tachypnea, tachycardia and higher oxygen requirements, he was given Tocilizumab. 2 weeks into his hospital stay, his surveillance imaging demonstrated small bowel perforation with free intraperitoneal air and intrabdominal abscesses. He was started on antibiotics, total parenteral nutrition and obtained 2 intraperitoneal drains. His further hospital stay was complicated by development of hypotension and asystole cardiac arrest. Patient B was a 65-year-old renal transplant recipient with COVID-19 pneumonia who received Remdesivir, Dexamethasone, convalescent plasma and Tocilizumab. During his hospital stay, he had worsening hypoxic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Subsequently, patient developed fevers with worsening leukocytosis and new pressor requirements. He was started on broad spectrum antibiotic coverage and imaging demonstrated pneumatosis of ascending colon concerning for impending perforation. After discussion with family members, patient was transitioned towards comfort measures. DISCUSSION: Tocilizumab is an Interleukin-6 receptor antagonist which was used for the profound inflammatory state associated with COVID-19. Recent studies have demonstrated its ineffectiveness in preventing further clinical deterioration, intubation or death in moderately ill hospitalized patients with COVID-19. In prior studies in rheumatoid arthritis, Tocilizumab was noted to have a higher incidence of lower gastrointestinal perforations, especially with preexisting diverticulitis or steroid use. The exact mechanism of bowel perforation is unclear and is likely multifactorial. Early after bowel injury, there is a substantial increase in Interleukin-6 expression that stimulates epithelial proliferation. Absence of this, in combination with intestinal hypoperfusion seen in critically ill patients may potentially increase the risk of intestinal perforation. Our cases emphasize the importance of close monitoring and caution while using lesser known and more risky medications without clearly established guidelines.","Asharaf, A.; Papierniak, E.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,575,20

COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 is associated with an acute respiratory illness that varies from mild to the life-threatening acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The complement system is part of the innate immune arsenal against pathogens, in which many viruses can evade or employ to mediate cell entry. The immunopathology and acute lung injury orchestrated through the influx of pro-inflammatory macrophages and neutrophils can be directly activated by complement components to prime an overzealous cytokine storm. The manifestations of severe COVID-19 such as the ARDS, sepsis and multiorgan failure have an established relationship with activation of the complement cascade. We have collected evidence from all the current studies we are aware of on SARS-CoV-2 immunopathogenesis and the preceding literature on SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV infection linking severe COVID-19 disease directly with dysfunction of the complement pathways. This information lends support for a therapeutic anti-inflammatory strategy against complement, where a number of clinically ready potential therapeutic agents are available.","Polycarpou, Anastasia; Howard, Mark; Farrar, Conrad A; Greenlaw, Roseanna; Fanelli, Giorgia; Wallis, Russell; Klavinskis, Linda S; Sacks, Steven",EMBO Mol Med,575,11

With highly contagious variants expanding in Europe while vaccine hesitancy persists, safe options to maintain schools open are urgently needed. We developed an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in school. We used empirical contact data measured in a primary and a secondary school in France, and field estimates for adherence to screening from 683 schools during the spring 2021 wave. Examining different screening protocols, we performed a cost-benefit analysis for varying epidemic conditions and vaccination scenarios. In a partially immunized school population, weekly screening would reduce the number of cases on average by 24% in the primary and 53% in the secondary school compared to symptom-based testing alone, if R=1.3 and 50% adhered to screening. This adherence was met in primary schools (53% (95% confidence interval 21-85%)), but insufficient participation was recorded in secondary schools (10% (1-38%) in middle schools, 6% (2-12%) in high schools). Regular screening would also reduce by 90% the number of student-days lost compared to reactive class closure. No difference was predicted when fully vaccinating teachers, due to their limited number and mixing. Partially vaccinating adolescents would still require regular screening for additional control (20% case reduction with 50% vaccinated students). In the upcoming fall, COVID-19 epidemic will likely continue to pose a risk to the safe opening of schools. Increasing vaccination coverage in adolescents and implementing regular testing while largely incentivizing adherence are essential steps to keep schools open.","Colosi, Elisabetta; Bassignana, Giulia; Contreras, Diego A; Poirier, Canelle; Cauchemez, Simon; Yazdanpanah, Yazdan; Lina, Bruno; Fontanet, Arnaud; Barrat, Alain; Colizza, Vittoria",,575,16

This enables a deeper level of knowledge and the provision of a huge amount of data for which management and fruitful integration with the past evidence requires a steadily growing computational effort. In light of this, immunoinformatics emerges as a new discipline placed in between the traditional lab-based investigations and the computational analysis of the biological data. Immunoinformatics make use of tailored bioinformatics tools and data repositories to facilitate the analysis of data from a plurality of disciplines and help drive novel research hypotheses and in silico screening investigations in a fast, reliable, and cost-effective manner. Such computational immunoproteomics studies may as well prepare and guide lab-based investigations, representing valuable technology for the investigation of novel pathogens, to tentatively evaluate specificity of diagnostic products, to forecast on potential adverse effects of vaccines and to reduce the use of animal models. The present manuscript provides an overview of the COVID-19 pandemic and reviews the state of the art of the omics technologies employed in fighting SARS-CoV-2 infections.

prevalent neurodegenerative disease of aging (70%) Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in AD are a major cause of burden to patients, caregivers, and society and are near-universal at some point in the AD course (97%) One of the most troubling NPS is agitation (Agit-AD), typified by a variety of problem behaviors including combativeness, yelling, pacing, lack of cooperation with care, insomnia, and restlessness Neurobiological mechanisms that contribute to Agit-AD include brain atrophy, degradation of neurotransmission, neuroinflammation, disrupted circadian rhythms, comorbidities, and frailty There is a great need for better interventions that target Agit-AD, which is a major source of disease progression, patient disability, financial burden, and caregiver stress Dronabinol is synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, one of the predominant biochemical constituents of cannabis) and is FDA approved for anorexia and nausea Cannabinoids may improve Agit-AD by providing protection against neuroinflammation and excitotoxicity, regulating neurotransmitters, improving comorbidities, stabilizing circadian rhythms, and increasing cerebral blood flow This pilot trial could open the door to ""re-purposing"" dronabinol as a novel and safe treatment for Agit-AD with significant public health impact Methods THC-AD is a three-week placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trial of dronabinol (10 mg QD) in 80 patients with severe Agit-AD Capsules of dronabinol contain 2 5 mg per dose (5 mg daily) during Week 1, then increase to 5 mg per dose (10 mg daily) for Weeks 2 and 3 The half-life of dronabinol is ∼4 hours, so study medication is administered BID at 08:00 and 14:00 to maximize daytime coverage for agitation and to minimize sundowning Inclusionary criteria include a diagnosis of AD, severe agitation as determined by the Neuropsychiatric Inventory-Clinician Rating Scale (NPI-C), and being 60-95 years old, while exclusionary criteria include serious or unstable medical illness, seizure disorder, delirium, current use of lithium, and inability to swallow a pill Primary outcomes are a change in the Pittsburgh Agitation Scale and NPI-C Agitation/Aggression subscales Secondary outcomes are measures of agitation, cognition, sleep, and global functioning as determined by the following assessments: the NPI-C, Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory, Clinical Global Impression of Change, Activities of Daily Living, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Severe Impairment Battery (8 item), and subjective and observer-rated drug effects Safety outcomes include monitoring for adverse events (AEs), weekly health assessments, EKG changes, incident delirium (Confusion Assessment Method), and changes in laboratory values DNA specimens are collected to explore cannabinoid receptor polymorphisms that may affect response to dronabinol Serum samples are collected to examine the association of peripheral markers of inflammation with agitation and response to dronabinol Concomitant medications are limited to currently used antipsychotics, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines, as well as anticonvulsant therapy when not used for seizure disorder PRN rescue medications include total daily doses up to 0 75 mg of lorazepam and 100 mg of trazodone Results We have enrolled 37 out of 80 participants (Table 1: mean age 78 2 years, 78 4% female, 83 8% Caucasian, mean education 13 2 years, 48 6% family history) Study participants are significantly cognitively impaired (Table 2: mean baseline MMSE of 7 1), agitated (mean NPI-C Agitation 14 8, mean NPI-C Aggression 6 4) and in reasonable overall health (Figure 1: General Medical Health Rating, 10 8% “excellent,” 48 6% ""good"" and 40 5% ""fair”) Recorded AEs have been tolerable (Figure 2) Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we expanded our inpatient trial to include outpatient enrollments and implemented hybrid visits with telemedicine to limit in-person interactions To bolster our recruitment, we are collaborating with additional clinical sites, increasing dementia bed capacity, and deploying recruitment strategies for outpatients, including referrals from providers and other research trials, social media ads, and virtual community outreach Updated results will be presented at AAGP (estimated 6-10 additional participants) Conclusions Agitation is one of the most common behavioral manifestations of AD and is associated with greater caregiver burden and shorter time to institutionalization Current treatments for Agit-AD have a plethora of safety limitations, and there is a particularly acute need for interventions for severe Agit-AD in advanced dementia One important question for treatment development is whether Agit-AD represents a specific target for intervention or a nonspecific syndrome shared with many other diseases This clinical trial may enable us to understand if targeting the cannabinoid system will be a safe and effective approach to treat this global

The aim of this study was to verify whether there was an association between low skeletal muscle index and in-hospital mortality, intensive care unit admission, and invasive mechanical ventilation need in hospitalized patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: This was a retrospective cohort study of a referral center for COVID-19. We included all consecutive patients admitted to the hospital between February 26 and May 15, 2020, with a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. Skeletal muscle index was assessed from a transverse computed tomography image at the level of twelfth thoracic vertebra with National Institutes of Health ImageJ software, and statistical analysis was performed to find an association between skeletal muscle index and in-hospital mortality, need of invasive mechanical ventilation, and intensive care unit admission. RESULTS: We included 519 patients, the median age was 51 (42-61) yrs, and 115 patients (22%) had low skeletal muscle index. On multivariable analysis, skeletal muscle index was not associated with mortality, intensive care unit admission, or invasive mechanical ventilation need nor in a subanalysis of patients 65 yrs or older. CONCLUSIONS: Skeletal muscle index determined by computed tomography at the level of twelfth thoracic vertebra was not associated with negative outcomes in hospitalized patients with COVID-19.","Moctezuma-Velázquez, Paulina; Miranda-Zazueta, Godolfino; Ortiz-Brizuela, Edgar; González-Lara, María Fernanda; Tamez-Torres, Karla Maria; Román-Montes, Carla Marina; Díaz-Mejía, Bruno Alejandro; Pérez-García, Esteban; Villanueva-Reza, Marco; Tovar-Méndez, Víctor Hugo; Medrano-Borromeo, Carla; Martínez-Valenzuela, Alejandra; Jandete-Medina, Míguel Ángel; Martínez-Guerra, Bernardo Alonso; Uscanga-Domínguez, Luis; Sifuentes-Osornio, José; Ponce-de-León, Alfredo; Olivas-Martinez, Antonio; Moctezuma-Velázquez, Carlos",Am J Phys Med Rehabil,575,20

In this paper, which is to the best of our knowledge the first review that completely covers millimeter wave sensing application pipelines, we provide a comprehensive overview and analysis of different basic application pipeline building blocks, including hardware, algorithms, analytical models, and model evaluation techniques. The review also provides a taxonomy that highlights different millimeter wave sensing application domains. By performing a thorough analysis, complying with the systematic literature review methodology and reviewing 165 papers, we not only extend previous investigations focused only on communication aspects of the millimeter wave technology and using millimeter wave technology for active imaging, but also highlight scientific and technological challenges and trends, and provide a future perspective for applications of millimeter wave as a sensing technology.","Berlo, Bram van; Elkelany, Amany; Ozcelebi, Tanir; Meratnia, Nirvana",,575,16

This study thus aimed to (1) compare psychological distress (including fear of COVID-19 infection, stress, anxiety, and depression), perceived weight stigma, and problematic internet-related behaviors between schoolchildren with and without overweight; (2) assess whether perceived weight stigma and problematic internet-related behaviors explained psychological distress. METHODS: Schoolchildren (n = 1357; mean age = 10.7 years) with overweight (n = 236) and without overweight (n = 1121) completed an online survey assessing their fear of COVID-19 infection, stress, anxiety, depression, perceived weight stigma, problematic smartphone application use, problematic social media use, and problematic gaming. RESULTS: Schoolchildren with overweight had significantly higher levels of COVID-19 infection fear, stress, depression, perceived weight stigma, and problematic social media use than those without overweight. Regression models showed that perceived weight stigma and problematic internet-related behaviors were significant predictors of psychological distress among schoolchildren with overweight. CONCLUSION: Strategies to manage perceived weight stigma and problematic internet-related behaviors may have a positive influence on mental health among schoolchildren with overweight under health-threatening circumstances, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.","Chen, Chao-Ying; Chen, I-Hua; O039,; Brien, Kerry S; Latner, Janet D; Lin, Chung-Ying",Int J Obes (Lond),575,24

Existing predictions are merely based on qualitative analyses and mathematical modeling. The use of available big data with machine learning is still limited in COVID-19 growth prediction even though the availability of data is abundance. To make use of big data in the prediction using deep learning, we use long short-term memory (LSTM) method to learn the correlation of COVID-19 growth over time. The structure of an LSTM layer is searched heuristically until the best validation score is achieved. First, we trained training data containing confirmed cases from around the globe. We achieved favorable performance compared with that of the recurrent neural network (RNN) method with a comparable low validation error. The evaluation is conducted based on graph visualization and root mean squared error (RMSE). We found that it is not easy to achieve the same quantity of confirmed cases over time. However, LSTM provide a similar pattern between the actual cases and prediction. In the future, our proposed prediction can be used for anticipating forthcoming pandemics.

BACKGROUND: Patients in cardiogenic shock with severe MR have a poor prognosis in the setting of conventional medical therapy. Because of its favorable safety profile, TMVr is being increasingly used as an acute therapy in this population, though its efficacy remains unknown. METHODS: A multicenter, collaborative, patient-level analysis was conducted. Patients with cardiogenic shock and moderate to severe (3+) or severe (4+) MR who were not surgical candidates were treated with TMVr. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality Secondary outcomes included 90-day mortality, heart failure (HF) hospitalization, and the combined event rate of 90-day mortality and HF hospitalization following dichotomization by TMVr device success. RESULTS: Between January 2011 and February 2019, 141 patients across 14 institutions met the inclusion criteria. In-hospital mortality occurred in 22 patients (15.6%), at 90 days in 38 patients (29.5%), and at one year in 55 patients (42.6%). Median length of hospital stay following TMVr was 10 days (interquartile range: 6 to 20 days). HF hospitalization occurred in 26 patients (18.4%) at a median of 73 days (interquartile range: 26 to 546 days). When stratified by TMVr procedural results, successful TMVr reduced rates of in-hospital mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13 to 0.98; p = 0.04), 90-day mortality (HR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.16 to 0.78; p = 0.01), and the composite of 90-day mortality and HF hospitalization (HR: 0.41; 95% CI: 0.19 to 0.90; p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: TMVr may improve short- and intermediate-term mortality in high-risk patients with cardiogenic shock and moderate to severe MR. Randomized studies are needed to definitively establish MR as a therapeutic target in patients with cardiogenic shock.","Jung, Richard G; Simard, Trevor; Kovach, Christopher; Flint, Kelsey; Don, Creighton; Di Santo, Pietro; Adamo, Marianna; Branca, Luca; Valentini, Francesca; Benito-González, Tomás; Fernández-Vázquez, Felipe; Estévez-Loureiro, Rodrigo; Berardini, Alessandra; Conti, Nicolina; Rapezzi, Claudio; Biagini, Elena; Parlow, Simon; Shorr, Risa; Levi, Amos; Manovel, Ana; Cardenal-Piris, Rosa; Diaz Fernandez, Jose; Shuvy, Mony; Haberman, Dan; Sala, Alessandra; Alkhouli, Mohamad A; Marini, Claudia; Bargagna, Marta; Schiavi, Davide; Denti, Paolo; Markovic, Sinisa; Buzzatti, Nicola; Chan, Vincent; Hynes, Mark; Mesana, Thierry; Labinaz, Marino; Pappalardo, Federico; Taramasso, Maurizio; Hibbert, Benjamin",JACC cardiovasc. interv,575,24

The start of the pandemic meant that, in England, schools were closed to all but vulnerable pupils and the children of ‘key workers’, and so the normal placements of students in teacher education (ITE students) could not continue. The ‘virtualisation’ of the ITE programmes by, in some cases, both schools and universities, raised significant issues of both equity and pedagogy. The loss of time on school placement had the effect of lost opportunities for practising teaching but increasing the time for reading and reflection. We consider the effects on a teacher education programme when the practicum experience is abruptly curtailed, yet the programme is able to continue in a different way. We present a model framework for a new digital pedagogy for ITE and discuss the opportunities and affordances available as the post-Covid educational landscape emerges, and suggest that the Covid-19 crisis provides an opportunity to reflect on the idea that practicum experience may be a necessary but not, in itself, a sufficient condition for teacher learning.","la Velle, Linda; Newman, Stephen; Montgomery, Catherine; Hyatt, David",J.

As a result, large numbers of unemployed workers returned to their hometowns during April 2020, increasing the risk of spreading the virus across the entire country. Approach: In anticipation of the large-scale movement of unemployed workers, the Thai government trained existing village health volunteers to recognize the symptoms of COVID-19 and educate members of their communities. Provincial health offices assembled COVID-19 surveillance teams of these volunteers to identify returnees from high-risk areas, encourage self-quarantine for 14 days, and monitor and report the development of any relevant symptoms. Local setting: Despite a significant and recent expansion of the health-care workforce to meet sustainable development goal targets, there still exists a shortage of professional health personnel in rural areas of Thailand. To compensate for this, the primary health-care system includes trained village health volunteers who provide basic health care to their communities. Relevant changes: Village health volunteers visited more than 14 million households during March and April 2020. Volunteers identified and monitored 809 911 returnees, and referred a total of 3346 symptomatic patients to hospitals by 13 July 2020.

Sixty percent of participants had 'reduced cycling exposure' and 40% had 'no reduction in cycling exposure' at follow up. Twenty-two percent of participants had not cycled at all since the crash. Despite 46% reporting fear of crashing/ lack of confidence as a reason for 'reduced cycling exposure', only 7% of all participants had received any counselling. After controlling for confounding factors, those who participated in group riding before the crash (OR: 0.24, 95% CI: 0.08-0.66, p = 0.006) and those who had a 'complete functional recovery' (OR: 0.15, 95% CI: 0.04-0.64, p = 0.011), had lower odds of 'reduced cycling exposure' at follow-up. In addition, those who were not employed full time at baseline had higher odds of 'reduced cycling exposure' at follow up (OR: 3.72, 95% CI: 1.22-11.33, p = 0.021). Provision of psychological services following a bicycle crash may be an important intervention for improving levels of fear and confidence surrounding cycling and assisting cyclists in returning to their pre-crash level of participation. In addition, interventions promoting return to cycling, should be targeted towards non-group riders who cycle for either commuting or recreational purposes.","L Fraser, Michelle; Meuleners, Lynn B",Accid Anal Prev,575,16

The influence such guidance has on sexual activity is not known. AIM: To investigate levels and correlates of sexual activity during COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing in a sample of the UK public. METHODS: This paper presents preplanned interim analyses of data from a cross-sectional epidemiological study, administered through an online survey. OUTCOMES: Sexual activity was measured using the following question: ""On average after self-isolating how many times have you engaged in sexual activity weekly?"" Demographic and clinical data were collected, including sex, age, marital status, employment, annual household income, region, current smoking status, current alcohol consumption, number of chronic physical conditions, number of chronic psychiatric conditions, any physical symptom experienced during self-isolation, and number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. The association between several factors (independent variables) and sexual activity (dependent variable) was studied using a multivariable logistic regression model. RESULTS: 868 individuals were included in this study. There were 63.1% of women, and 21.8% of adults who were aged between 25 and 34 years. During self-isolation/social distancing, 39.9% of the population reported engaging in sexual activity at least once per week. Variables significantly associated with sexual activity (dependent variable) were being male, a younger age, being married or in a domestic partnership, consuming alcohol, and a higher number of days of self-isolation/social distancing. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In this sample of 868 UK adults self-isolating owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, the prevalence of sexual activity was lower than 40%. Those reporting particularly low levels of sexual activity included females, older adults, those not married, and those who abstain from alcohol consumption. STRENGTH AND LIMITATIONS: This is the first study to investigate sexual activity during the UK COVID-19 self-isolation/social distancing. Participants were asked to self-report their sexual activity potentially introducing self-reporting bias into the findings. Second, analyses were cross-sectional and thus it is not possible to determine trajectories of sexual activity during the current pandemic. CONCLUSION: Interventions to promote health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic should consider positive sexual health messages in mitigating the detrimental health consequences in relation to self-isolation/social distancing and should target those with the lowest levels of sexual activity.

Alaska's seafood processing industry attracts approximately 18,000 out-of-state workers annually (2). Many of the state's seafood processing facilities are located in remote areas with limited health care capacity. On March 23, 2020, the governor of Alaska issued a COVID-19 health mandate (HM10) to address health concerns related to the impending influx of workers amid the COVID-19 pandemic (3). HM10 required employers bringing critical infrastructure (essential) workers into Alaska to submit a Community Workforce Protective Plan.* On May 15, 2020, Appendix 1 was added to the mandate, which outlined specific requirements for seafood processors, to reduce the risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in these high-density workplaces (4). These requirements included measures to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the workplace, including testing of incoming workers and a 14-day entry quarantine before workers could enter nonquarantine residences. After 13 COVID-19 outbreaks in Alaska seafood processing facilities and on processing vessels during summer and early fall 2020, State of Alaska personnel and CDC field assignees reviewed the state's seafood processing-associated cases. Requirements were amended in November 2020 to address gaps in COVID-19 prevention. These revised requirements included restricting quarantine groups to &#8804;10 persons, pretransfer testing, and serial testing (5). Vaccination of this essential workforce is important (6); until high vaccination coverage rates are achieved, other mitigation strategies are needed in this high-risk setting. Updating industry guidance will be important as more information becomes available.","Porter, Kimberly A; Ramaswamy, Maya; Koloski, Thomas; Castrodale, Louisa; McLaughlin, Joseph",MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep,575,1

Raoultella Planticola is an aerobic, gram-negative rod-shaped bacterium known to cause opportunistic infection. Only three cases of R. Planticola pneumonia reported in the United States until 2017. We present a rare case of spontaneous pneumothorax from rupture of lung bulla as a late sequela from COVID-19 pneumonia and superinfection of the bulla by R. Planticola. Case: A 37-year-old man presented to the emergency department (ED) with a sudden onset of sharp right-sided chest pain and shortness of breath after an episode of dry cough. One month before the presentation, he was tested positive for COVID-19, with the only symptom being dry cough, without hospitalization or treatment. He works in construction, never smoked. On arrival, he was in respiratory distress with tachypnea. Chest radiograph revealed subcutaneous emphysema and right-sided pneumothorax with large bleb at the right mid lung field. An emergent pigtail catheter tube was placed with the resolution of pneumothorax. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from nasopharyngeal swab detected infection by COVID-19. Serologic workup revealed leukocytosis and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate: 34 mm/hr. Computed tomography (CT) showed (Image) large right-sided bulla, bilateral patchy infiltrates. Sputum analysis was negative for bacteria, fungi, and mycobacterium tuberculosis. Further workup was negative for eosinophilia, aspergillus, autoimmune diseases, and HIV. His symptoms and leukocytosis improved without needing antibiotics or steroids. Later the chest tube was removed and was discharged. Post-discharge follow-up in the pulmonary clinic, he complained of hemoptysis and was referred to the ED. Repeat CT revealed patchy ground-glass opacities, new bullae in the left lung, and resolving right lung bulla with fluid and debris in the dependent portion, which led to suspect pneumonia and bullous infection. Sputum culture grew R. Planticola, resistant to ampicillin;he was started on amoxicillin-clavulanic acid with improvement in symptoms and was subsequently discharged. A repeat follow-up CT after a month showed resolution of bullae with scarring. Discussion: Bullous lung lesions in COVID-19 pneumonia were reported in the literature irrespective of mechanical ventilation status. Although superinfection of bullous lesions is known, this is the first reported case of R. Planticola pneumonia in a patient with COVID-19 lung bullae. COVID-19 patients are at heightened risk for bullous lung lesions and superinfection by opportunistic organisms;thus, they should be followed-up closely.","Jadav, R.; Avula, A.; Robles, M.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,575,24

The Deeper, Wider, Faster (DWF) program is a survey focused on the identification of fast evolving transients, such as fast radio bursts, gamma-ray bursts, and supernova shock breakouts. It employs a multi-frequency simultaneous coverage of the same part of the sky over several orders of magnitude. Using the Dark Energy Camera mounted on the 4-meter Blanco telescope, DWF captures a 20 second g-band exposure every minute, at a typical seeing of ~ 1'' and an airmass of ~ 1.5. These optical data are collected simultaneously with observations conducted over the entire electromagnetic spectrum - from radio to gamma-rays - as well as cosmic ray observations. In this paper, we present a novel real-time light curve analysis algorithm, designed to detect transients in the DWF optical data; this algorithm functions independently from, or in conjunction with, image subtraction. We present a sample of fast transients detected by our algorithm, as well as a false-positive analysis. Our algorithm is customizable and can be tuned to be sensitive to transients evolving over different timescales and flux ranges.","Strausbaugh, Robert; Cucchiara, Antonino; Dow, Michael; Webb, Sara; Zhang, Jielai; Goode, Simon; Cooke, Jeff",,575,3

Identifying a reliable and fast diagnostic device is needed for effective testing. We assessed performance and ease-of-use of the Abbott PanBio antigen-detecting rapid diagnostic test (Ag-RDT). METHODS: This prospective, multi-centre diagnostic accuracy study enrolled at two sites in Germany. Following routine testing with reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), a second study-exclusive swab was performed for Ag-RDT testing. Routine swabs were nasopharyngeal (NP) or combined NP/oropharyngeal (OP) whereas the study-exclusive swabs were NP. To evaluate performance, sensitivity and specificity were assessed overall and in predefined sub-analyses accordingly to cycle-threshold values, days after symptom onset, disease severity and study site. Additionally, an ease-of-use assessment (EoU) and System Usability Scale (SUS) were performed. RESULTS: 1108 participants were enrolled between Sept 28 and Oct 30, 2020. Of these, 106 (9.6%) were PCR-positive. The Abbott PanBio detected 92/106 PCR-positive participants with a sensitivity of 86.8% (95% CI: 79.0% - 92.0%) and a specificity of 99.9% (95% CI: 99.4%-100%). The sub-analyses indicated that sensitivity was 95.8% in Ct-values <25 and within the first seven days from symptom onset. The test was characterized as easy to use (SUS: 86/100) and considered suitable for point-of-care settings. CONCLUSION: The Abbott PanBio Ag-RDT performs well for SARS-CoV-2 testing in this large manufacturer independent study, confirming its WHO recommendation for Emergency Use in settings with limited resources.","Krüger, Lisa J; Gaeddert, Mary; Tobian, Frank; Lainati, Federica; Gottschalk, Claudius; Klein, Julian A F; Schnitzler, Paul; Kräusslich, Hans-Georg; Nikolai, Olga; Lindner, Andreas K; Mockenhaupt, Frank P; Seybold, Joachim; Corman, Victor M; Drosten, Christian; Pollock, Nira R; Knorr, Britta; Welker, Andreas; de Vos, Margaretha; Sacks, Jilian A; Denkinger, Claudia M",PLoS One,575,10

By contrast, examining the anterior of the eye can reveal conditions affecting the front of the eye, such as changes to the eyelids, cornea, or crystalline lens. In this work, we studied whether external photographs of the front of the eye can reveal insights into both diabetic retinal diseases and blood glucose control. We developed a deep learning system (DLS) using external eye photographs of 145,832 patients with diabetes from 301 diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening sites in one US state, and evaluated the DLS on three validation sets containing images from 198 sites in 18 other US states. In validation set A (n=27,415 patients, all undilated), the DLS detected poor blood glucose control (HbA1c>9%) with an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 70.2; moderate-or-worse DR with an AUC of 75.3; diabetic macular edema with an AUC of 78.0; and vision-threatening DR with an AUC of 79.4. For all 4 prediction tasks, the DLS's AUC was higher (p<0.001) than using available self-reported baseline characteristics (age, sex, race/ethnicity, years with diabetes). In terms of positive predictive value, the predicted top 5% of patients had a 67% chance of having HbA1c>9%, and a 20% chance of having vision threatening diabetic retinopathy. The results generalized to dilated pupils (validation set B, 5,058 patients) and to a different screening service (validation set C, 10,402 patients).

Emergency disposal scenarios of medical waste generated during the COVID-19 pandemic require a systematic assessment to quantify their potential environmental impacts. The environmental impacts and key factors of three movable disposal scenarios (i.e. incineration disposal vehicle, movable steam and microwave sterilization equipment both followed by co-incineration with municipal solid waste) were quantified via life cycle assessment approach. Furthermore, the environmental impacts of three movable disposal and two co-incineration scenarios were compared via life cycle assessment by expanding system boundaries. The results show that co-incineration with municipal solid waste has the lowest environmental impacts due to environmental benefits produced by power generation, while co-incineration with hazardous waste is the highest due to the high energy consumption. Energy consumption (i.e. kerosene, electricity and diesel) are the key factors for three movable disposal scenarios. For movable steam and microwave sterilization equipment followed by co-incineration with municipal solid waste, power generation from incinerating disinfected medical waste has significant beneficial environmental impacts due to avoided impacts of electricity consumption. The recommendations for improvement of the emergency disposal and management of medical waste during the COVID-19 pandemic globally and other serious epidemic in the future are provided.","Zhao, Hailong; Liu, HanQiao; Wei, Guoxia; Wang, Hongtao; Zhu, Yuwen; Zhang, Rui; Yang, Yong",Waste Manag,575,25

This clinical problem needs an urgent solution. Therefore, here, we propose a series of clinical strategies for non-ICU physicians aimed at the standardization of the management of non-critically ill patients with COVID-19 from the perspective of critical care medicine. Isolation management is performed to facilitate the implementation of hierarchical monitoring and intervention to ensure the reasonable distribution of scarce critical care medical resources and intensivists, highlight the key patients, timely detection of disease progression, and early and appropriate intervention and organ function support, and thus improve the prognosis.

INTERVENTION: This project was undertaken in four phases. During phase 1, an informal discussion was held with the breastfeeding mothers, service providers, and community partner in identifying issues surrounding lactation counselling facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic. During phase 2, recommendations from 23 organizations with regard to breastfeeding during COVID-19 were reviewed and analyzed. During phase 3, using evidence from reliable sources, a 5-minute animated e-resource on breastfeeding during COVID-19 was conceptualized and developed. During phase 4, the e-resource was disseminated to the breastfeeding mothers, general public, post-secondary institutions, and organizations providing services to breastfeeding mothers in Canada. OUTCOMES: This evidence-based e-resource facilitated addressing misconceptions around breastfeeding during COVID-19 and raising public awareness on safe infant feeding practices during this pandemic. Overall, the video was described as an informative, user-friendly, useful, and easily accessible resource by breastfeeding mothers who were in self-isolation with little access to healthcare services during the pandemic. IMPLICATIONS: This project highlighted the importance of patient engagement and collaboration with the community partner in protecting breastfeeding during the COVID-19 pandemic. It further illustrated how informational e-resources can protect breastfeeding in situations where breastfeeding mothers' access to healthcare services is compromised.","Hirani, Shela Akbar Ali; Pearce, Megan; Lanoway, Amanda",Can. j. public health,575,1

However, many current computational methods of such calculations are either inefficient or inaccurate in practice. Utilizing implicit solvent models in the molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA) framework allows for efficient calculations without significant loss of accuracy. Here, GBNSR6, a new flavor of the generalized Born model, is employed in the MM/GBSA framework for measuring the binding affinity between SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the human ACE2 receptor. A computational protocol is developed based on the widely studied Ras-Raf complex, which has similar binding free energy to SARS-CoV-2/ACE2. Two options for representing the dielectric boundary of the complexes are evaluated: one based on the standard Bondi radii and the other based on a newly developed set of atomic radii (OPT1), optimized specifically for protein-ligand binding. Predictions based on the two radii sets provide upper and lower bounds on the experimental references: -14.7(&#916;GbindBondi)<-10.6(&#916;GbindExp.)<-4.1(&#916;GbindOPT1) kcal/mol. The consensus estimates of the two bounds show quantitative agreement with the experiment values. This work also presents a novel truncation method and computational strategies for efficient entropy calculations with normal mode analysis. Interestingly, it is observed that a significant decrease in the number of snapshots does not affect the accuracy of entropy calculation, while it does lower computation time appreciably. The proposed MM/GBSA protocol can be used to study the binding mechanism of new variants of SARS-CoV-2, as well as other relevant structures.","Forouzesh, Negin; Mishra, Nikita",Molecules (Basel),575,1

Not all health care providers and patients are equally ready to take part in the telehealth revolution, which raises concerns for health equity during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Without proactive efforts to address both patient- and provider-related digital barriers associated with socioeconomic status, the wide-scale implementation of telehealth amid COVID-19 may reinforce disparities in health access in already marginalized and underserved communities. To ensure greater telehealth equity, policy changes should address barriers faced overwhelmingly by marginalized patient populations and those who serve them. CONTEXT: The COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed fundamental shifts across the US health care delivery system, including a rapid transition to telehealth. Telehealth has many potential advantages, including maintaining critical access to care while keeping both patients and providers safe from unnecessary exposure to the coronavirus. However, not all health care providers and patients are equally ready to take part in this digital revolution, which raises concerns for health equity during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: The study analyzed data about small primary care practices' telehealth use and barriers to telehealth use collected from rapid-response surveys administered by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene's Bureau of Equitable Health Systems and New York University from mid-April through mid-June 2020 as part of the city's efforts to understand how primary care practices were responding to the COVID-19 pandemic following New York State's stay-at-home order on March 22. We focused on small primary care practices because they represent 40% of primary care providers and are disproportionately located in low-income, minority or immigrant areas that were more severely impacted by COVID-19. To examine whether telehealth use and barriers differed based on the socioeconomic characteristics of the communities served by these practices, we used the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) to stratify respondents as being in high-SVI or low-SVI areas. We then characterized respondents' telehealth use and barriers to adoption by using means and proportions with 95% confidence intervals. In addition to a primary analysis using pooled data across the five waves of the survey, we performed sensitivity analyses using data from respondents who only took one survey, first wave only, and the last two waves only. FINDINGS: While all providers rapidly shifted to telehealth, there were differences based on community characteristics in both the primary mode of telehealth used and the types of barriers experienced by providers. Providers in high-SVI areas were almost twice as likely as providers in low-SVI areas to use telephones as their primary telehealth modality (41.7% vs 23.8%; P <.001). The opposite was true for video, which was used as the primary telehealth modality by 18.7% of providers in high-SVI areas and 33.7% of providers in low-SVI areas (P <0.001). Providers in high-SVI areas also faced more patient-related barriers and fewer provider-related barriers than those in low-SVI areas. CONCLUSIONS: Between April and June 2020, telehealth became a prominent mode of primary care delivery in New York City. However, the transition to telehealth did not unfold in the same manner across communities. To ensure greater telehealth equity, policy changes should address barriers faced overwhelmingly by marginalized patient populations and those who serve them.","Chang, Ji E; Lai, Alden Yuanhong; Gupta, Avni; Nguyen, Ann M; Berry, Carolyn A; Shelley, Donna R",Milbank Q,575,1

However, as COVID-19 is highly contagious, its existence has made the tracheostomy a high-risk procedure. Tracheostomy procedures must, therefore, be adjusted for safety reasons. The aim is to present the adjustments that should be made to the surgical technique. METHODS: Both the medical charts and surgical reports of patients with COVID-19 who were subjected to elective open tracheostomies were reviewed. RESULTS: The retrospective study included 25 patients. Our adjustments include the timing of tracheostomies, ideally putting them at 21 days after the onset of COVID-19, the advancement of an endotracheal tube to 26-28 cm from the upper-alveolar ridge, surgery being carried out in the intensive care unit with appropriately modified positions of the patient and providers, tracheo-cutaneous sutures, and intentionally making the small tracheal flap and the tracheal window the same shape as a medieval shield.

On a national level, the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) has modified operation guidelines for the evaluation and early release of eligible non-violent, at-risk offenders. However, each state government and Department of Corrections have the responsibility and jurisdiction to enforce policies within their own prison systems. To combat the escalation of positive cases and to protect the safety of inmates, some prison systems have accelerated early release procedures for eligible prisoners. Compared to other states, the State of Nevada has started early with the enforcement of quarantine and testing protocols to combat the spread of COVID-19, starting in early March. However, the State of Nevada has not passed orders for the early release or home confinement of eligible inmates. States such as California and Pennsylvania, have already created criteria for inmates eligible for early release and have released prisoners. Other states like Arizona and Indiana have not released guidelines but are looking favorably toward doing so. Growing incarceration rates are rapidly overwhelming facility operational capacities, which only makes the probability of spreading COVID-19 within prisons and outside the prisons inevitable. Data analysis shows an increased probability of having positive cases and community spread of COVID-19 within a correctional facility as prison size, which was indicated by the population capacity, increases. In all states, the number of confirmed cases continues to steadily climb. Before more outbreaks can potentially occur and more prisoners' lives are lost, it is crucial to look at measures to decrease inmate population capacities such as decreasing the intake of new prisoners, expanding space in existing facilities to enforce social distancing, and maximizing storage spaces. Home-confinement is another possible option that prisons can utilize to help decrease prison populations. This study examines the relationship between increasing prison populations and the escalating number of total confirmed positive cases of COVID-19, while proposing for the state Department of Corrections to implement a reduction in prison populations to decrease the transmission of COVID-19.","Hwang, Seung Joon Omsii Kim Min Ju Omsii Havins Weldon E.

METHODS: A model that consisted of six compartments was built. The compartments were the susceptible (S), the asymptomatic infective (A), the presymptomatic infective (L), the symptomatic infective (I), the recovered (R), and the deceased (D). The A, L and I classes were infective states. To construct the model, several parameters were set as fixed using existing evidence and the rest of the parameters were estimated by fitting the model to a smoothed curve of the cumulative confirmed cases in Wuhan from 24 January 2020 to 6 March 2020. Input data about the cost-effectiveness analysis were retrieved from the literature. RESULTS: Conducting RT-PCR tests three times for diagnosing and discharging people with COVID-19 reduced the estimated total number of symptomatic cases to 45| 013 from 51 144 in the two-test strategy over 43 days. The former strategy also led to 850.1 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) of health gain and a net healthcare expenditure saving of CN¥49.1 million. About 100.7 QALYs of the health gain were attributable to quality-adjusted life day difference between the strategies during the analytic period and 749.4 QALYs were attributable to years of life saved. CONCLUSIONS: More accurate strategies and methods of testing for the control of COVID-19 may reduce both the number of infections and the total medical costs. Increasing the number of tests should be considered in regions with relatively severe epidemics when existing tests have moderate sensitivity.","Jiang, Yawen; Cai, Dan; Chen, Daqin; Jiang, Shan",,575,29

Respiratory mucosa, the main entrance of SARS-CoV-2 infection, are equipped with an innate immune defense system as the initial response against infection. Activation of the adaptive immune system facilitates viral clearance as well as providing immunological memory for prevention from subsequent exposure. However, despite repeated efforts at implementing appropriate interventions, severe and fatal cases are continuing to occur and reports of recurrent cases need clarification. Host factors may contribute to the severity of the diseases while viral immune evasion is a common phenomenon leading to severe outcomes and recurrent infection. Discussions of immunological-based tests for screening, herd immunity, along with the possible advantages or potentially futile efforts of development of vaccine and alternative immunotherapy have become a part of daily household conversations. In this review, evidence of innate and adaptive immune responses or lack of them, and immunological problems relevant for SARS-CoV-2 will be summarized.

The era that will evolve after this pandemic is likely to provide uncertainty and service model disruptions. HF treatment is based on guidelines derived from randomised clinical trial evidence. Translational shortfalls from trials into practice have been overcome with post-trial service improvement studies like OPTIMIZE-HF where a team using a process of care can translate evidence to the general population. However, gaps remain for vulnerable populations e.g. those with more severe HF, with multiple comorbid conditions, and certain demographic groups and/or residents in remote locations. Health technology has come with great promise, to fill some of these gaps. The COVID-19 pandemic provides an opportunity to observe, from Australian healthcare lens, HF management outside the traditional model of care.

However, current human-virus PPI database resources are incomplete, lack annotation and usually do not provide the opportunity to computationally predict human-virus PPIs. Here, we present the Human-Virus Interaction DataBase (HVIDB, http://zzdlab.com/hvidb/) that provides comprehensively annotated human-virus PPI data as well as seamlessly integrates online PPI prediction tools. Currently, HVIDB highlights 48 643 experimentally verified human-virus PPIs covering 35 virus families, 6633 virally targeted host complexes, 3572 host dependency/restriction factors as well as 911 experimentally verified/predicted 3D complex structures of human-virus PPIs. Furthermore, our database resource provides tissue-specific expression profiles of 6790 human genes that are targeted by viruses and 129 Gene Expression Omnibus series of differentially expressed genes post-viral infections. Based on these multifaceted and annotated data, our database allows the users to easily obtain reliable information about PPIs of various human viruses and conduct an in-depth analysis of their inherent biological significance. In particular, HVIDB also integrates well-performing machine learning models to predict interactions between the human host and viral proteins that are based on (i) sequence embedding techniques, (ii) interolog mapping and (iii) domain-domain interaction inference. We anticipate that HVIDB will serve as a one-stop knowledge base to further guide hypothesis-driven experimental efforts to investigate human-virus relationships.","Yang, Xiaodi; Lian, Xianyi; Fu, Chen; Wuchty, Stefan; Yang, Shiping; Zhang, Ziding",Brief Bioinform,575,29

Healthcare workers (HCW) in radiology departments are exposed to a high infection risk similar to HCWs in the ICU or dedicated COVID wards. The goal of our paper is to evaluate the prevalence of IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 among radiology HCWs in two different hospitals and regions in Germany with a low and high COVID-19 prevalence and to compare it to the prevalence in other clinical personnel. Additionally, we assessed the number of radiological procedures performed in patients with a positive PCR test (C+) followed by a short review of the risk for nosocomial infections of radiology HCWs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the first COVID-19 wave between March and July 2020, we evaluated a region with one of the highest COVID-19 rates (776-1570/100â000) in Germany (Hospital A). Additionally, we assessed Hospital B in a region with a low prevalence (65/100â000). We tested the serum prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among the whole staff with a subgroup analysis for radiology in both hospitals. We calculated the total number of different radiological procedures performed in C+ patients. RESULTS: In Hospital A 594 PCR-proven C+ patients were treated resulting in 2723 radiological procedures. 24â% (nâ=â6) of the radiology technicians and 13.35 (nâ=â2) of radiologists had a positive IgG test. The rates were similar to positive rates in HCWs in COVID-19 wards and ICUs within the hospital. The most frequently performed procedures in C+ patients were chest X-rays (3.17/patient) and CT examinations (1.15/patient). In Hospital B 50 C+ patients were treated, resulting in 64 radiological procedures. None of the HCWs tested IgG positive. The most frequently performed examinations were also chest X-rays (1.04/patient) and CT (0.2/patient). CONCLUSION: HCWs in radiology have a high occupational infection risk similar to that of HCWs in ICUs and dedicated COVID wards.

In this review we collate current clinical and immunologic reports, comparing these to reports of previous coronaviruses to identify mechanisms driving progression to severe disease in some patients. In brief, we propose a model wherein dysregulated type I interferon signalling leads to aberrant recruitment and accumulation of innate immune lineages in the lung, impairing establishment of productive adaptive responses, and permitting a pathologic pro-inflammatory state.

Given these problems can have significant impacts throughout the lifespan, preventing the negative repercussions of COVID-19 on children's mental health is essential. Philosophy for children (P4C) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) show promise in this regard. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present study was to compare the impact of online MBI and P4C interventions on mental health, within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We used a randomized cluster trial to assess and compare the impact of both interventions on elementary school students' (N = 37) anxiety and inattention symptoms as well as on their basic psychological need satisfaction (BPN). RESULTS: ANCOVAs revealed a significant effect of the P4C intervention on mental health difficulties, controlling for baseline levels. Participants in the P4C group showed lower scores on the measured symptoms at post-test than participants in the MBI group. Significant effects of the MBI on levels of BPN were also found. Participants in the MBI intervention reported greater BPN satisfaction at post-test than participants in the P4C intervention. CONCLUSION: Results from this study suggest that, in the current context of the COVID-19 pandemic, a P4C intervention centered around COVID-19 related themes may be helpful to reduce mental health difficulties, that a MBI may be useful to satisfy BPN, and that both interventions were easy to offer online to elementary school students. Future work including a larger sample size and follow-up measures is warranted. PUBLIC SIGNIFICANCE: Practice: Philosophy for children (P4C) and mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) can be used to foster mental health in elementary school students, in the current COVID-19 context. Policy: As we do not anticipate that facilitators will be allowed in schools during the 2020-2021 school year and that children will, most likely, be attending school in the current COVID-19 context, policymakers who want to implement psychological support measures in elementary schools should consider an online modality, which has shown in this study to work well, be feasible, and yield positive results on youth mental health.","Malboeuf-Hurtubise, Catherine; Léger-Goodes, Terra; Mageau, Geneviève A; Joussemet, Mireille; Herba, Catherine; Chadi, Nicholas; Lefrançois, David; Camden, Chantal; Bussières, Ève-Line; Taylor, Geneviève; Éthier, Marc-André; Gagnon, Mathieu",Prog Neuropsychopharmacol Biol Psychiatry,575,20

We aimed to determine the independent contribution of sex to stroke, myocardial infarction and death in the setting of COVID-19 infection. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in a racially/ethnically diverse population. Clinical features, laboratory markers and clinical events were initially abstracted from medical records, with subsequent clinician adjudication. RESULTS: Of 2060 patients, myocardial injury (32% vs 23%, p = 0.019), acute myocardial infarction (2.7% vs 1.6%, p = 0.114), and ischemic stroke (1.8% vs 0.7%, p = 0.007) were more common in men vs women. In-hospital death occurred in 160 men (15%) vs 117 women (12%, p = 0.091). Men had higher odds of myocardial injury (odds ratio (OR) 2.04 [95% CI 1.43-2.91], p < 0.001), myocardial infarction (1.72 [95% CI 0.93-3.20], p = 0.085) and ischemic stroke (2.76 [95% CI 1.29-5.92], p = 0.009). Despite adjustment for demographics and cardiovascular risk factors, male sex predicted mortality (HR 1.33; 95% CI:1.01-1.74; p = 0.041). While men had significantly higher markers of inflammation, in sex-stratified analyses, increase in interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, ferritin and d-dimer were predictive of mortality and myocardial injury similarly in both sexes. CONCLUSIONS: Adjusted odds of myocardial injury, ischemic stroke and all-cause mortality, but not myocardial infarction, are significantly higher in men compared to women with COVID-19. Higher inflammatory markers are present in men but associated similarly with risk in both men and women. These data suggest that adverse cardiovascular outcomes in men vs. women are independent of cardiovascular comorbidities.","Minhas, Anum S; Shade, Julie K; Cho, Sung-Min; Michos, Erin D; Metkus, Thomas; Gilotra, Nisha A; Sharma, Garima; Trayanova, Natalia; Hays, Allison G",Int. j. cardiol,575,16

METHODS: We performed a prospective cohort study of Emergency Medicine (EM) physicians working at a Level 1 Trauma Center who chose to use self-supplied EFMs for PPE. All subjects used commercial EFMs with disposable filters (N95, P95, or P100). All subjects chose their mask size independently with no input from employee health regarding appropriate fit. Per study protocol, subjects were fit tested periodically during clinical shifts over the course of the 6-week study period. All investigators performing fit testing underwent OSHA qualitative fit testing training. Data collected included mask/filters age, subjective assessment of mask seal quality, and fit test results. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. RESULTS: 105 fit tests were performed on physicians wearing EFMs over the course of 49 shifts. Physicians felt their fit was adequate for all tests performed. There were no fit test failures in any subjects. CONCLUSIONS: EFMs have an extremely low failure rate.

This study evaluated a virtual model of care in acromegalic patients. Methods: We recruited 78 acromegalic patients, 65% female, median age 63 years. Outpatient management was remodeled to simplify access to care by (1) adoption of virtual meetings; (2) collection of blood samples at home; (3) abolishment of printed prescription and provision of electronic files directly to central pharmacy; and (4) drugs delivered to patients' home. Patients and physicians filled electronic surveys 48 h after each consultation. Results: The patients expressed satisfaction with convenience (91.1%), decreased wait time (85.1%), and saving money (79.2%) compared to face-to-face visits. Most patients felt supported by the medical team (89.1%) and kept the prescriptions updated (84.8%). The physicians reported resolutive appointments in 92.2% of cases, despite longer time to reach the patients and subsequent calls to complement missing information. Satisfaction and patient-provider relationship were maintained during the study, but the choice for virtual appointment for the next appointment fell from 78.7% to 34.8% after 6 months. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was confirmed in 13% of patients, mostly mild and moderate manifestations. Conclusion: Telemedicine is a tool for medical care in underserved populations, feasible even in low-income countries. This study suggests that it is difficult to sustain exclusive remote care for more than 6 months. The method could be adopted interchangeably with in-person consultations in acromegalic patients with stable disease.","Naves, Luciana Ansaneli; Rosa, Isabella Naves; Lima, Thomas Alves de Souza; Santana, Lidiana Bandeira de; Castro, Lucas Faria de; Casulari, Luiz Augusto",Telemed. j. e. health,575,6

Older adults, as well as people living with cancer, appear to be particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 related morbidity and mortality, which means that older adults with cancer are an especially high-risk population. This has led to significant changes in the way geriatric oncologists provide care to older patients, including the implementation of novel methods for clinical visits, interruptions or delays in procedures, and modification of therapeutic strategies, both in the curative and palliative settings. In this manuscript, we provide a global overview of the perspectives of geriatric oncology providers from countries across Europe, America, and Asia, regarding the adaptive strategies utilized to continue providing high quality care for older patients with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic.

STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal analysis of contacts identified from index cases. METHODS: A contact tracing study was carried out in the Northern Metropolitan area of Barcelona, Spain, during the inter-epidemic lapse of May to July 2020, a period of low SARS-CoV-2 incidence. Index cases were notified from the referral hospital. Contacts were traced and followed up for 14 days. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed on day 0 and day 14 for contacts. RESULTS: In total, 368 contacts were identified from 81 index cases (median of seven contacts per index case), from which 308 were traced successfully. The median age of contacts was 28 years, 62% (223 of 368) were men. During the follow-up period, 100 contacts tested positive for COVID-19 (32.5% [95% confidence interval {CI} = 27.3-38.0]), with a secondary infection rate of 48.3% (95% CI = 40.8-55.9) among housemates. Clusters of index and respective contacts tended to aggregate within disadvantaged neighbourhoods (P < 0.001), and non-national index cases (N = 28, 34.1%) resulted in higher secondary infection rates compared with nationals (51.0% [95% CI = 41.0-60.9] vs 22.3% [95% CI = 16.8-28.8]; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Disadvantaged communities experience a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 and may act as infection reservoirs. Contact tracing with a cross-cutting approach among these communities is required, especially during inter-epidemic periods.","Vallès, X; Roure, S; Valerio, L; López-Muñoz, I; Pérez-Quílez, O; Soldevila, L; Martín-Cano, L; Estrada, O; Palacín, M D; Blanco, I; Orozco, J; Esquerrà, A; Villanova, X",Public Health,575,16

In this work, the gravitational bending of acoustic Schwarzschild black hole is investigated. We resort to the approach developed by Gibbons and Werner, in which the gravitational deflection angle is calculated using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem in geometrical topology. In this approach, the gravitational bending is directly connected with the topological properties of curved spacetime. In this work, the gravitational deflection angle of light, weak gravitational lensing and Einstein ring for acoustic Schwarzschild black hole are carefully studied and analyzed. The results show that the gravitational bending effects in acoustic Schwarzschild black hole are enhanced, compared with those in conventional Schwarzschild black hole. This observation indicates that the acoustic black holes may be more easily detectable in gravitational bending and weak gravitational lensing observations.

As of June 2020, 107 (55%) of the 194 WHO Member States have introduced HPV vaccination. The Americas and Europe are by far the WHO regions with the most introductions, 85% and 77% of their countries having already introduced respectively. A record number of introductions was observed in 2019, most of which in low- and middle- income countries (LMIC) where access has been limited. Programs had an average performance coverage of around 67% for the first dose and 53% for the final dose of HPV. LMICs performed on average better than high- income countries for the first dose, but worse for the last dose due to higher dropout. Only 5 (6%) countries achieved coverages with the final dose of more than 90%, 22 countries (21%) achieved coverages of 75% or higher while 35 (40%) had a final dose coverage of 50% or less. When expressed as world population coverage (i.e., weighted by population size), global coverage of the final HPV dose for 2019 is estimated at 15%. There is a long way to go to meet the 2030 elimination target of 90%.

Dozens of real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) assays have been developed to meet the urgent need of COVID-19 control. However, methodological comparisons among the developed qRT-PCR assays are limited. In the present study, we evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, amplification efficiency, and linear detection ranges of three qRT-PCR assays, including the assays developed by our group (IPBCAMS), and the assays recommended by WHO and China CDC (CCDC). The three qRT-PCR assays exhibited similar sensitivities, with the limit of detection (LoD) at about 10 copies per reaction (except the ORF 1b gene assay in CCDC assays with a LoD at about 100 copies per reaction). No cross reaction with other respiratory viruses were observed in all of the three qRT-PCR assays. Wide linear detection ranges from 106 to 101 copies per reaction and acceptable reproducibility were obtained. By using 25 clinical specimens, the N gene assay of IPBCAMS assays and CCDC assays performed better (with detection rates of 92 % and 100 %, respectively) than that of the WHO assays (with a detection rate of 60 %), and the ORF 1b gene assay in IPBCAMS assays performed better (with a detection rate of 64 %) than those of the WHO assays and the CCDC assays (with detection rates of 48 % and 20 %, respectively). In conclusion, the N gene assays of CCDC assays and IPBCAMS assays and the ORF 1b gene assay of IPBCAMS assays were recommended for qRT-PCR screening of SARS-CoV-2.","Xiao, Yan; Li, Zhen; Wang, Xinming; Wang, Yingying; Wang, Ying; Wang, Geng; Ren, Lili; Li, Jianguo",J Virol Methods,575,16

These challenges have had mental health consequences, and concerning reports of burnout have emerged globally. We conducted a cross-sectional survey at a designated COVID-19 hospital in Shanghai at the peak of the pandemic, i.e. about 2 months after the onset of the outbreak from February to April 2020. Findings revealed burnout in 6.85% of nurses. Of 336 respondents, 87 (25.89%) had a high level of emotional exhaustion, 61 (18.15%) had a high level of depersonalization, and 100 (29.76%) had a low level of personal accomplishment. Burnout can be prevented by offering more support from families and supervisors, paying attention to health monitoring and personal protection, and creating a rational human resource allocation and shift management system. Specific training on infection control and self-protection, mental health guidance, and stress coping techniques must be implemented. As the current health crisis ultimately abates, moving the focus from mental health issues to public health issues, more attention and support at the national and organizational levels are needed to reduce occupational discrimination, nurse autonomy and status need to be promoted, and public health emergency teams need to be created. A positive and fair working environment is essential to effective healthcare delivery.","Zhang, Lin; Chai, Ling; Zhao, Yihong; Wang, Lin; Sun, Wenxiu; Lu, Lingqing; Lu, Hongzhou; Zhang, Jianliang",Biosci Trends,575,24

The reported incidence of AKI, however, varies among studies. We aimed to evaluate the incidence of AKI and its association with mortality and morbidity in children infected with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who required hospital admission. METHODS: This was a multicenter retrospective cohort study from three tertiary centers, which included children with confirmed COVID-19. All children were evaluated for AKI using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) definition and staging. RESULTS: Of 89 children included, 19 (21 %) developed AKI (52.6 % stage I). A high renal angina index score was correlated with severity of AKI. Also, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) was increased in children with AKI compared to those with normal kidney function (15 % vs. 1.5 %). Patients with AKI had significantly more pediatric intensive care admissions (PICU) (32 % vs. 2.8 %, p < 0.001) and mortality (42 % vs. 0 %, p < 0.001). However, AKI was not associated with prolonged hospitalization (58 % vs. 40 %, p = 0.163) or development of MIS-C (10.5 % vs. 1.4 %, p = 0.051). No patient in the AKI group required renal replacement therapy. Residual renal impairment at discharge occurred in 9 % of patients. This was significantly influenced by the presence of comorbidities, hypotension, hypoxia, heart failure, acute respiratory distress, hypernatremia, abnormal liver profile, high C-reactive protein, and positive blood culture. CONCLUSIONS: AKI occurred in one-fifth of children with SARS-CoV-2 infection requiring hospital admission, with one-third of those requiring PICU.

We use high-throughput sequencing of bulk and plasma B cells collected at multiple time points during infection to characterize signatures of the B cell response to SARS-CoV-2 in 19 individuals. Using principled statistical approaches, we associate differential features of BCRs with different disease severity. We identify 38 significantly expanded clonal lineages shared among individuals as candidates for responses specific to SARS-CoV-2. Using single-cell sequencing, we verify the reactivity of BCRs shared among individuals to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes.

BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 epidemic, under the influence of multiple factors, nurses were vulnerable to negative emotions. While previous studies have explored, the role of emotional intelligence in negative emotions, the relationship between the two has not been sufficiently discussed in the context of COVID-19. DESIGN: The study carried out a cross-sectional survey. The STROBE was selected as the checklist in this study. METHODS: 202 nurses from Wuhan makeshift hospital participated in the questionnaire survey. Data collection tools included a general data questionnaire designed by the researchers, Chinese version of EI scale (WLEIS-C) and Chinese version of depression-anxiety-stress scale (DASS-21). Descriptive statistics, single factor analysis, and correlation analysis were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The emotional intelligence of the front-line nurses was in the upper middle range. Among the negative emotions, anxiety was the most prominent symptom. CONCLUSIONS: Managers should pay attention to the negative emotional problems of front-line nurses, improve their EI level and promote mental health and the progress of epidemic prevention. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Improving the level of emotional intelligence can reduce the frequency and intensity of negative emotions. In clinical work, emotional intelligence can be used as a skill to carry out relevant training, which is conducive to playing a positive role in future emergencies.","Sun, Huili; Wang, Shuling; Wang, Wei; Han, Guanghong; Liu, Zhijian; Wu, Qi; Pang, Xiaoli",J. clin. nurs,575,9

Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 experience a variety of symptoms, including fever, muscle pain, tiredness, cough, and difficulty breathing. Elderly people and those with underlying health conditions are considered to be more at risk of developing severe symptoms and have a higher risk of physical deconditioning during their hospital stay. Physical therapists have an important role in supporting hospitalized patients with COVID-19 but also need to be aware of challenges when treating these patients. In line with international initiatives, this article aims to provide guidance and detailed recommendations for hospital-based physical therapists managing patients hospitalized with COVID-19 through a national approach in the Netherlands. METHODS: A pragmatic approach was used. A working group conducted a purposive scan of the literature and drafted initial recommendations based on the knowledge of symptoms in patients with COVID-19, and current practice for physical therapist management for patients hospitalized with lung disease and patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). An expert group of hospital-based physical therapists in the Netherlands provided feedback on the recommendations, which were finalized when consensus was reached among the members of the working group. RESULTS: The recommendations include safety recommendations, treatment recommendations, discharge recommendations, and staffing recommendations. Treatment recommendations address 2 phases of hospitalization: when patients are critically ill and admitted to the ICU, and when patients are severely ill and admitted to the COVID ward. Physical therapist management for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 comprises elements of respiratory support and active mobilization. Respiratory support includes breathing control, thoracic expansion exercises, airway clearance techniques, and respiratory muscle strength training. Recommendations toward active mobilization include bed mobility activities, active range-of-motion exercises, active (-assisted) limb exercises, activities-of-daily-living training, transfer training, cycle ergometer, pre-gait exercises, and ambulation.","Felten-Barentsz, Karin M; van Oorsouw, Roel; Klooster, Emily; Koenders, Niek; Driehuis, Femke; Hulzebos, Erik H J; van der Schaaf, Marike; Hoogeboom, Thomas J; van der Wees, Philip J",Phys. ther,575,1

Personal protective equipment (PPE) including masks and gloves is needed to avoid transmission. Adverse skin reactions associated with PPE have been described, but there is no information regarding objective measures to assess skin impairment related to PPE. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of using facial mask and nitrile gloves on epidermal barrier function and skin homeostasis. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was designed. Thirty-four health care workers wearing nitrile gloves and a mask for 2 hours were included. Transepidermal water loss, stratum corneum hydration, erythema, and temperature were measured. RESULTS: Transepidermal water loss (31.11 vs 14.24 g·m-2·h-1), temperature (33.29°C vs 32.57°C), and erythema were significantly greater at the area covered by gloves compared with the noncovered area. Transepidermal water loss (22.82 vs 13.69 g·m-2·h-1), temperature, and erythema (411.43 vs 335.52 arbitrary units) were significantly increased at the area covered by mask, whereas stratum corneum hydration was lower. Transepidermal water loss was greater at the area covered by a surgical mask than at a filtering respirator mask coded filtering facepiece 2 (27.09 vs 18.02 g·m-2·h-1, P = 0.034).

While SARS-CoV-2 titers can be measured by detection of viral nucleic acid, this method is unable to quantitate infectious virions. Measurement of infectious SARS-CoV-2 can be achieved by tissue culture infectious dose-50 (TCID50 ), which detects the presence or absence of cytopathic effect in cells infected with serial dilutions of a virus specimen. However, this method only provides a qualitative infectious virus titer. Plaque assays are a quantitative method of measuring infectious SARS-CoV-2 by quantifying the plaques formed in cell culture upon infection with serial dilutions of a virus specimen. As such, plaque assays remain the gold standard in quantifying concentrations of replication-competent lytic virions. Here, we describe two detailed plaque assay protocols to quantify infectious SARS-CoV-2 using different overlay and staining methods. Both methods have several advantages and disadvantages, which can be considered when choosing the procedure best suited for each laboratory. These assays can be used for several research purposes, including titration of virus stocks produced from infected cell supernatant and, with further optimization, quantification of SARS-CoV-2 in specimens collected from infected animals. © 2019 The Authors.

Immune dysregulation with altered innate cytokine responses is thought to contribute to disease severity. Here, we characterized in depth host cell responses against SARS-CoV-2 in primary human airway epithelia (HAE) and immortalized cell lines. Our results demonstrate that primary HAE and model cells elicit a robust induction of type I and III interferons (IFNs). Importantly, we show for the first time that melanoma differentiation associated gene (MDA)-5 is the main sensor of SARS-CoV-2 in lung cells. IFN exposure strongly inhibited viral replication and de novo production of infectious virions. However, despite high levels of IFNs produced in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the IFN response was unable to control viral replication in lung cells, contrary to what was previously reported in intestinal epithelial cells. Altogether, these results highlight the complex and ambiguous interplay between viral replication and the timing of IFN responses.IMPORTANCE Mammalian cells express sensors able to detect specific features of pathogens and induce the interferon response, which is one of the first line of defenses against viruses and help controlling viral replication. The mechanisms and impact of SARS-CoV-2 sensing in lung epithelial cells remained to be deciphered. In this study, we report that despite a high production of type I and III interferons specifically induced by MDA-5-mediated sensing of SARS-CoV-2, primary and immortalized lung epithelial cells are unable to control viral replication. However, exogenous interferons potently inhibited replication, if provided early upon viral exposure. A better understanding of the ambiguous interplay between the interferon response and SARS-CoV-2 replication is essential to guide future therapeutical interventions.","Rebendenne, Antoine; Valadão, Ana Luiza Chaves; Tauziet, Marine; Maarifi, Ghizlane; Bonaventure, Boris; McKellar, Joe; Planès, Rémi; Nisole, Sébastien; Arnaud-Arnould, Mary; Moncorgé, Olivier; Goujon, Caroline",J. virol,575,24

ClustalW, MUSCLE, ClustalO and MAFFT to align and subsequently identify the lists of mutations as substitution, deletion, insertion and SNP. Thereafter, a consensus of these results, called as Consensus Multiple Sequence Alignment (CMSA), is prepared to have the final list of mutations so that the advantages of all four alignment techniques can be preserved. The analysis shows 767, 2025 and 54 unique substitutions, deletions and SNPs in Indian SARS-CoV-2 genomes. More precisely, out of 54 SNPs, 4 SNPs are present close to the 60% of the virus population. The results of this experiment can be useful for virus classification, designing and defining the dose of vaccine for the Indian population.","Saha, Indrajit; Ghosh, Nimisha; Maity, Debasree; Sharma, Nikhil; Mitra, Kaushik",Infect Genet Evol,575,16

OBJECTIVES: Here, we investigated the molecular and biological characteristics of intestinal influenza viruses and their potential role in virus transmission. METHODS: Fecal samples were first screened for the presence of influenza viral RNA using RT-qPCR. Positive fecal samples were subjected to cell culture. Isolated viruses were then sequenced using MiSeq platform. Replication kinetics and receptor binding affinity were also evaluated. RESULTS: Influenza RNA was detected in stool samples of 41% (36/87) of influenza A positive patients. Among the 36 stool samples subjected to viral isolation, 5 showed virus growth. Sequence analysis of isolated viruses revealed two distinct mutation patterns in fecal viruses. Set I viruses was able to replicate to higher titers in cell culture despite the limited number of mutations (6 mutations) compared to set II viruses (>10 mutations). Functional analysis of both sets revealed the ability to replicate efficiently in differentiated human bronchial cells. Receptor binding testing has also demonstrated their ability to bind &#945; 2,3 and &#945; 2,6 sialic acid receptors. CONCLUSION: The ability of fecal influenza viruses to replicate in intestinal cells and human 3D bronchial cells might suggest their possible contribution in virus transmission.","Al Khatib, Hebah A; Coyle, Peter V; Al Maslamani, Muna A; Al Thani, Asmaa A; Pathan, Sameer A; Yassine, Hadi M",Infect Genet Evol,575,16

Infoveillance approaches using social media can help characterize disease distribution and public knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors critical to the early stages of an outbreak. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to conduct a quantitative and qualitative assessment of Chinese social media posts originating in Wuhan City on the Chinese microblogging platform Weibo during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak. METHODS: Chinese-language messages from Wuhan were collected for 39 days between December 23, 2019, and January 30, 2020, on Weibo. For quantitative analysis, the total daily cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan were obtained from the Chinese National Health Commission, and a linear regression model was used to determine if Weibo COVID-19 posts were predictive of the number of cases reported. Qualitative content analysis and an inductive manual coding approach were used to identify parent classifications of news and user-generated COVID-19 topics. RESULTS: A total of 115,299 Weibo posts were collected during the study time frame consisting of an average of 2956 posts per day (minimum 0, maximum 13,587). Quantitative analysis found a positive correlation between the number of Weibo posts and the number of reported cases from Wuhan, with approximately 10 more COVID-19 cases per 40 social media posts (P<.001). This effect size was also larger than what was observed for the rest of China excluding Hubei Province (where Wuhan is the capital city) and held when comparing the number of Weibo posts to the incidence proportion of cases in Hubei Province. Qualitative analysis of 11,893 posts during the first 21 days of the study period with COVID-19-related posts uncovered four parent classifications including Weibo discussions about the causative agent of the disease, changing epidemiological characteristics of the outbreak, public reaction to outbreak control and response measures, and other topics. Generally, these themes also exhibited public uncertainty and changing knowledge and attitudes about COVID-19, including posts exhibiting both protective and higher-risk behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study provide initial insight into the origins of the COVID-19 outbreak based on quantitative and qualitative analysis of Chinese social media data at the initial epicenter in Wuhan City. Future studies should continue to explore the utility of social media data to predict COVID-19 disease severity, measure public reaction and behavior, and evaluate effectiveness of outbreak communication.","Li, Jiawei; Xu, Qing; Cuomo, Raphael; Purushothaman, Vidya; Mackey, Tim",JMIR Public Health Surveill,575,3

Una nueva etiología que se ha presentado en el contexto de pandemia actual es el síndrome respiratorio agudo severo relacionado con el nuevo coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2). Éste es responsable de alteraciones hepáticas en 2 a 11% de la población general infectada por este virus, y de hasta un 30% en las embarazadas que se infectan con SARS-CoV-2. Con el objetivo de mostrar una presentación poco frecuente del SARS-CoV-2 se expone un caso clínico de elevación de transaminasas en embarazada inducida por este nuevo virus. CASO CLÍNICO: Paciente de 36 años, cursando embarazo de 20+6 semanas, consulta por dolor abdominal asociado a ictericia y coluria. Se solicita estudio donde destaca elevación de transaminasas. Ecografía abdominal con vía biliar fina. Se descartan diferentes etiologías de hepatitis aguda y crónica (dada la falta de antecedentes). Finalmente se solicita PCR para COVID-19 que resulta positiva. CONCLUSIÓN: Luego de un estudio exhaustivo de diferentes etiologías de elevación de transaminasas, se atribuye esta alteración enzimática a SARS-CoV-2. Se decide seguimiento ambulatorio estricto con pruebas hepáticas cada dos semanas. La paciente evoluciona estable con exámenes normales luego de un mes desde que se indica el alta hospitalaria. Después de descartar etiologías frecuentes de elevación de transaminasas durante el embarazo, sugerimos solicitar el estudio de este virus con PCR para COVID-19, ya que podría ser una presentación poco frecuente de SARS-CoV-2.","Sabat V, Scherezade; von Bischhoffshausen P, Sofía; Jordán U, Felipe; Latorre R, Rodrigo; Troncoso R, Fernando",Rev. chil. obstet. ginecol.

The overuse and the improper use of antibiotics in human medicine, food production, and the environment as a whole have unfortunately contributed to this issue. Many major international scientific, political, and social organizations have warned that the increase in AMR could cost the lives of millions of people if it is not addressed on a global scale. Although AMR is already a challenge in clinical practice today, it has taken on a new importance in the face of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. While improved handwashing techniques, social distancing, and other interventional measures may positively influence AMR, the widespread use of antibiotics to treat or prevent bacterial coinfections, especially in unconfirmed cases of COVID-19, may have unintended negative implications with respect to AMR. Although the exact number of bacterial coinfections and the rate at which patients with COVID-19 receive antibiotic therapy remain to be accurately determined, the pandemic has revived the discussion on antibiotic overuse and AMR. This article describes why the COVID-19 pandemic has increased our awareness of AMR and presents the immense global impact of AMR on society as a whole. Furthermore, an attempt is made to stress the importance of tackling AMR in the future and the role of the orthopaedic community in this worldwide effort.","Metsemakers, Willem-Jan; Zalavras, Charalampos; Schwarz, Edward M; Chen, Antonia F; Trampuz, Andrej; Moriarty, T Fintan",,575,15

Nurse leaders face particular challenges in mitigating risk and supporting nursing staff to negotiate moral distress and fatigue during large-scale, sustained crises. Synthesizing the burgeoning literature on COVID-19-related burnout and moral distress faced by nurses and identifying effective interventions to reduce poor mental health outcomes will enable nurse leaders to support the resilience of their teams. Aim: This paper aims to (1) synthesize existing literature on COVID-19-related burnout and moral distress among nurses and (2) identify recommendations for nurse leaders to support the psychological needs of nursing staff. Methods: Comprehensive searches were conducted in Medline, Embase and PsycINFO (via Ovid); CINAHL (via EBSCOHost); and ERIC (via ProQUEST). The rapid review was completed in accordance with the World Health Organization Rapid Review Guide. Key Findings: Thematic analysis of selected studies suggests that nurses are at an increased risk for stress, burnout and depression during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

While HCPs are expected to tackle this crisis by working in hospital and intensive care setting, there is real risk of them contracting infection and even dying. This article aims to report cases of healthcare personnel (HCPs) contracting COVID19 in various settings in a tertiary care hospital, a designated COVID centre, with view to disseminate information and review safety and psychological health issues of healthcare professionals. This study is a cross-sectional hospital-based survey from April 2020-June 2020. Data on demographics, workplace safety and psychological parameters from HCPs was collected by both interview and an online questionnaire form. A total of 40 healthcare workers were infected in the hospital in a period of 2 months since the first COVID case was admitted in the hospital. Almost 57.5% reported positive on several psychological parameters like anxiety, fear, anger, irritability and insomnia. About 42.5% had no psychological counselling after testing positive. These cases illustrate work-place risks for healthcare workers of acquiring COVID19 and highlight the problems faced in terms of risks of transmission to patients and colleagues, isolation of contacts in departments leading to near-breakdown of services and psychological stress to healthcare workers. Healthcare workers being at frontline of exposure to corona patients are at increased risk of developing COVID19 infections. Healthcare workers are working under tremendous stress in this pandemic and it is necessary to combat fear with facts and work towards safe work atmosphere so that they can discharge their duties to best of their ability.","Dabholkar, Yogesh G; Sagane, Bhagyashree Ajit; Dabholkar, Twinkle Y; Divity, Shivakumar",Indian J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg,575,20

Methods Diagnoses of COVID-19 were based on positive results from real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal-swab specimens. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients showing positive results. The clinical characteristics and results of blood tests were compared between the patients with and without pneumonia. The risk factors associated with pneumonia were then evaluated by a multivariable analysis. Results The study cohort comprised 154 patients, including 117 patients (76.0%) with pneumonia at first visit. Significant differences were seen in age, the frequency of fever, tachycardia, desaturation (peripheral oxygen saturation &#8804;95%), any comorbidity, neutrocyte count and fraction, lymphocyte count and fraction, platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and fibrinogen between the patients with and without pneumonia. Using a multivariable analysis, CRP &#8805;0.3 mg/dL and fibrinogen >400 mg/dL were found to be associated with the presence of pneumonia. Conclusion Community-based settings for screening COVID-19 patients should perform chest X-ray and blood tests for white blood cell fractions, fibrinogen, LDH, and CRP. Of these, elevations in the CRP and fibrinogen levels could be critically associated with the presence of COVID-19 pneumonia.","Morikawa, Miwa; Shinoda, Masahiro; Ota, Shinichiro; Yoshida, Yuto; Hirouchi, Takatomo; Shinada, Kanako; Sasaki, Osamu; Sato, Takashi; Kamachi, Kenichi; Shinkai, Masaharu",Intern Med,575,1

The versatility of AI/ML technologies enables scientists and technologists to address an impressively broad range of biomedical, epidemiological, and socioeconomic challenges. This wide-reaching scientific capacity, however, also raises a diverse array of ethical challenges. The need for researchers to act quickly and globally in tackling SARS-CoV-2 demands unprecedented practices of open research and responsible data sharing at a time when innovation ecosystems are hobbled by proprietary protectionism, inequality, and a lack of public trust. Moreover, societally impactful interventions like digital contact tracing are raising fears of surveillance creep and are challenging widely held commitments to privacy, autonomy, and civil liberties. Prepandemic concerns that data-driven innovations may function to reinforce entrenched dynamics of societal inequity have likewise intensified given the disparate impact of the virus on vulnerable social groups and the life-and-death consequences of biased and discriminatory public health outcomes. To address these concerns, I offer five steps that need to be taken to encourage responsible research and innovation. These provide a practice-based path to responsible AI/ML design and discovery centered on open, accountable, equitable, and democratically governed processes and products. When taken from the start, these steps will not only enhance the capacity of innovators to tackle COVID-19 responsibly, they will, more broadly, help to better equip the data science and AI/ML community to cope with future pandemics and to support a more humane, rational, and just society.","Leslie, David",,575,1

The two expressions are very often used interchangeably especially when it comes to their application. In this paper, the differences between business continuity and disaster recovery are discussed. The disaster management cycle is also addressed in order to highlight the importance of having plans before, during and after the occurrence of an incident. Design/methodology/approach A review of the extant literature on business continuity and disaster recovery was made. A number of different views were then presented in order to provide a better understanding of the two concepts and their potential overlap/connection. The literature review was conducted in 2020 using a variety of academic resources ranging from journal articles to text books and credible Internet websites. Relevant journal articles were obtained from two primary databases: Emerald Insight and EBSCOhost. Keywords, such as DRP, continuity, disruption and BCP, were mainly used to facilitate the search for these resources and other related material. Findings Reviewing the literature revealed that BCP and DRP are not the same. Yet, they are used interchangeably very often in the literature. This indicates a possible relationship/overlap between the two. The relationship between BCP and DRP can be viewed from a variety of perspectives, which altogether provide a better understanding of their purposes and application. Practical implications On top of the need to differentiate between business continuity and disaster recovery, the widespread impact of the current COVID-19 crisis, especially on businesses and supply chains, has unfolded the necessity to deal with business disruptions in all their forms and the significance of quick and effective recovery. This research clarifies the purpose of BCP and the purpose of DRP and their role in combating impacts of disruptive incidents on businesses and organizations. Originality/value BCP and DRP are discussed extensively in the literature. Yet, few studies attempted to address the precise functions of the two resulting in an obvious confusion between their meaning and purpose which subsequently reduced the uniqueness of their application and the uniqueness of the application of each. Only a small minority of practitioners and academics recognise the precise differences between the two. This study aims at clarifying this misconception to a wider set of readers and interested parties.","Sawalha, I. H.",International Journal of Emergency Services,575,16

Such a network could prove valuable during public health emergencies such as the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Our objective was to determine whether LHDs in the United States were tied together in an informal network to share information and advice about innovative community health practices, programs, and policies. METHODS: In January and February 2020, we conducted an online survey of 2,303 senior LHD leaders to ask several questions about their sources of advice. We asked respondents to rank up to 3 other LHDs whose practices informed their work on new public health programs, evidence-based practices, and policies intended to improve community health. We used a social network analysis program to assess answers. RESULTS: A total of 329 LHDs responded. An emergent network appeared to operate nationally among 740 LHDs. Eleven LHDs were repeatedly nominated by peers as sources of advice or examples (ie, opinion leaders), and 24 acted as relational bridges to hold these emergent networks together (ie, boundary spanners). Although 2 LHDs played both roles, most LHDs we surveyed performed neither of these roles. CONCLUSION: Opinion leading and boundary spanning health departments can be accessed to increase the likelihood of affecting the rate of interest in and adoption of innovations. Decision makers involved in disseminating new public health practices, programs, or policies may find our results useful both for emergencies and for practice-as-usual.","Chung, Minwoong; Dekker, Debra; Gridley-Smith, Chelsea; Dearing, James W",Prev Chronic Dis,575,33

The pandemic highlights an urgent need for a stable, easily produced, and effective vaccine. SARS-CoV-2 uses the spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to bind its cognate receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and initiate membrane fusion. Thus, the RBD is an ideal target for vaccine development. In this study, we designed three different RBD-conjugated nanoparticle vaccine candidates, namely, RBD-Ferritin (24-mer), RBD-mi3 (60-mer), and RBD-I53-50 (120-mer), via covalent conjugation using the SpyTag-SpyCatcher system. When mice were immunized with the RBD-conjugated nanoparticles (NPs) in conjunction with the AddaVax or Sigma Adjuvant System, the resulting antisera exhibited 8- to 120-fold greater neutralizing activity against both a pseudovirus and the authentic virus than those of mice immunized with monomeric RBD. Most importantly, sera from mice immunized with RBD-conjugated NPs more efficiently blocked the binding of RBD to ACE2 in vitro, further corroborating the promising immunization effect. Additionally, the vaccine has distinct advantages in terms of a relatively simple scale-up and flexible assembly. These results illustrate that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD-conjugated nanoparticles developed in this study are a competitive vaccine candidate and that the carrier nanoparticles could be adopted as a universal platform for a future vaccine development.","Kang, Yin-Feng; Sun, Cong; Zhuang, Zhen; Yuan, Run-Yu; Zheng, Qingbing; Li, Jiang-Ping; Zhou, Ping-Ping; Chen, Xin-Chun; Liu, Zhe; Zhang, Xiao; Yu, Xiao-Hui; Kong, Xiang-Wei; Zhu, Qian-Ying; Zhong, Qian; Xu, Miao; Zhong, Nan-Shan; Zeng, Yi-Xin; Feng, Guo-Kai; Ke, Changwen; Zhao, Jin-Cun; Zeng, Mu-Sheng",ACS Nano,575,16

Since the early phase of the pandemic, the ""cytokine-storm"" appeared a peculiar aspect of SARS-COV-2 infection which, at least in the severe cases, is responsible for respiratory treat damage and subsequent multi-organ failure. The efforts made in the last few months elucidated that the cytokine-storm results from a complex network involving cytokines/chemokines/infiltrating-immune-cells which orchestrate the aberrant immune response in COVID-19. Clinical and experimental studies aimed at depicting a potential ""immune signature"" of SARS-COV-2, identified three main ""actors,"" namely the cytokine IL-6, the chemokine CXCL10 and the infiltrating immune cell type macrophages. Although other cytokines, chemokines and infiltrating immune cells are deeply involved and their role should not be neglected, based on currently available data, IL-6, CXCL10, and infiltrating macrophages could be considered prototype factors representing each component of the immune system. It rapidly became clear that a strong and continuous interplay among the three components of the immune response is mandatory in order to produce a severe clinical course of the disease. Indeed, while IL-6, CXCL10 and macrophages alone would not be able to fully drive the onset and maintenance of the cytokine-storm, the establishment of a IL-6/CXCL10/macrophages axis is crucial in driving the sequence of events characterizing this condition. The present review is specifically aimed at overviewing current evidences provided by both in vitro and in vivo studies addressing the issue of the interplay among IL-6, CXCL10 and macrophages in the onset and progression of cytokine storm.

The main pressure comes from the pandemic situation, but what makes it possible is a complex set of factors and innovative environments built along the times, which this manuscript aims to study. Methods: Through an exploratory study within the scope of innovation management, the present manuscript aims to identify and explore factors that are promoting this accelerated development scenario. The method comprises the monitoring of the strategies adopted by the developers and other stakeholders, as regulatory and humanitarian agencies, specific mechanisms from governments and non-governments bodies, and the background technology that has paved this pathway. Results: Technology-based and R&D strategy factors are the two main factors identified and explored herein. The breakthrough in the field of biotechnology and molecular biology is considered the main base-science that enables the rapid development of new vaccines. Additionally, new technological platforms can also be pointed out. Relating to R&D strategies, the parallelism of phases and adaptive clinical trials in consonance with regulatory agencies are the most relevant. Conclusions: The need to rapidly develop a vaccine against COVID-19 occurs at a time of great excitement in basic scientific understanding, as well as strategies learned in the past by industry and optimization of regulatory pathways. It is expected that these factors, arising from the global emergency, may redirect the R&D processes for new drugs, especially in times of pandemic.","Defendi, Hugo Garcia Tonioli; da Silva Madeira, Luciana; Borschiver, Suzana",J Pharm Innov,575,1

In search of a tool to spread dermatologic knowledge during confinement, an online medical meeting was held on April 25th to 26th, 2020. In this study, we aimed to assess the characteristics, opinion and satisfaction of the attendees to a free-of-charge online congress. Secondarily, we intended to explain how this meeting was prepared. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Online survey administered to the attendees to an online congress organised via the Telegram® Messenger App. Its organisation and planning, which needed no financial support and was done by volunteer organisers, moderators and speakers, is described step by step. RESULTS: The satisfaction of both speakers and attendees was very high. All participants considered that this format had a great present and future, and most of them rated it as superior to regular face-to-face meetings. Female gender and predominantly private practice favoured this opinion. DISCUSSION: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the cancellation of most scientific gatherings. This has been seen by some authors as an excellent opportunity, encouraging medical societies and organisations to lead the change to virtual meetings. Although confinement did not allow real contact, our online meeting showed it was possible to ensure interaction and participation between attendees, moderators and speakers. Dermatologists enjoyed some dermatologic science, even despite the extraordinary circumstances disrupting their daily clinical practice.

In this review article, we summarize the current literature regarding social media use and IBD, discuss both the patient and physician perspective, and provide guidance to avoid commonly encountered pitfalls. RECENT FINDINGS: Patients and providers commonly rely on social media to share medical information, advocate for improved IBD care, and to network and collaborate on common research interests. This shift from more traditional formats of education and networking continues to grow exponentially, and even more rapidly so during the COVID-19 pandemic. SUMMARY: Social media use in the IBD community will continue to grow and lead to further innovation.

The authors estimate that since the order went into effect, collisions and especially injury and fatality collisions have been reduced by half, from ~1,000 crashes and ~400 injury/fatal crashes per day to 500 and 200 per day, respectively. These reductions have resulted in a savings to the public of about $40 million/day, or $1 billion since the order went into effect. Simultaneous to the reduction in injury crashes, there were fewer people treated by Sacramento region hospitals and trauma centers for crash-related injuries. They found that traffic volumes were up to 55% lower on certain highways after the order compared to a similar period prior to the order, which may account for the reduced number of collisions. The authors also found that maximum and average traffic speeds increased slightly on certain highways, but only by a few mph. When Southern California experienced heavy, record-breaking rains in early April, there was a brief return to “normal” levels of crashes. The authors highlight collision and injury/fatality hotspots on California highways since the shelter in place order went into effect and for a similar period in 2019. All data were derived from California Highway Patrol incident reports. This report includes maps of incident hotspots, and discusses this unexpected benefit of the shelter in place order.","Shilling, Fraser Waetjen David University of California Davis",,575,24

Whether we are selecting from a set of visualizations, commissioning someone to produce them, or creating them ourselves, an effective way of specifying intent can help guide this process. Ideally, we would have a concise and shared specification language. In previous work, we have argued that communicative intents can be viewed as a learning/assessment problem (i.e., what should the reader learn and what test should they do well on). Learning-based specification formats are linked (e.g., assessments are derived from objectives) but some may more effectively specify communicative intent. Through a large-scale experiment, we studied three specification types: learning objectives, insights, and assessments. Participants, guided by one of these specifications, rated their preferences for a set of visualization designs. Then, we evaluated the set of visualization designs to assess which specification led participants to prefer the most effective visualizations. We find that while all specification types have benefits over no-specification, each format has its own advantages. Our results show that learning objective-based specifications helped participants the most in visualization selection. We also identify situations in which specifications may be insufficient and assessments are vital.","Lee-Robbins, Elsie; He, Shiqing; Adar, Eytan",,575,24

A multifractal analysis,16.630032,1.3384217,2020,"The adaptive and innate branches of the vertebrate immune system work in close collaboration to protect organisms from harmful pathogens. As an organism ages its immune system undergoes immunosenescence, characterized by declined performance or malfunction in either immune branch, which can lead to disease and death. In this study we develop a mathematical model of the immune system that incorporates both the innate and adaptive immune compartments, named the integrated immune branch (IIB) model, and investigate how immune behavior changes in response to a sequence of pathogen encounters. We find that repeated pathogen exposures induce a fragility, in which exposure to novel pathogens may cause the immune response to transition to a chronic inflammatory state. The chronic inflammatory state of the IIB model is qualitatively consistent with""inflammaging,""a clinically-observed condition in which aged individuals experience chronic low-grade inflammation even in the absence of pathogens. Thus, the IIB model quantitatively demonstrates how immunosenescence can manifest itself in the innate compartment as inflammaging. In particular, the onset of a persistent inflammatory response strongly depends on the history of encountered pathogens; the timing of its onset differs drastically when the same set of infections occurs in a different order. Lastly, the coupling between the two immune branches generates a trade-off between rapid pathogen clearance and a delayed onset of immunosenescence. By considering complex feedbacks between immune compartments, our work suggests potential mechanisms for immunosenescence and provides a theoretical framework to account for clinical observations.","Jones, Eric; Sheng, Jiming; Carlson, Jean; Wang, Shenshen",,575,1

Since then, known as COVID-19 disease, the responsible viral pathogen, SARS-CoV-2, has spread around the world in a pandemic. Decisions on how to deal with the crisis are often based on simulations of the pandemic spread of the virus. The results of some of these, as well as their methodology and possibilities for improvement, will be described in more detail in this paper in order to inform beyond the current public health dogma called""flatten-the-curve"". There are several ways to model an epidemic in order to simulate the spread of diseases. Depending on the timeliness, scope and quality of the associated real data, these multivariable models differ in the value of used parameters, but also in the selection of considered influencing factors. It was exemplarily shown that epidemics in their course are simulated more realistically by models that assume subexponential growth. Furthermore, various simulations of the COVID-19 pandemic were presented in an European perspective, compared against each other and discussed in more detail. It is difficult to estimate how credible the simulations of the pandemic models currently are, so it remains to be seen whether the spread of the pandemic can be effectively reduced by the measures taken. Whether a model works well in reality is largely determined by the quality and scope of its underlying data. Past studies have shown that countermeasures are able to reduce reproduction numbers or transmission rates in epidemics. In addition to that, the presented modelling study provides a good framework for the creation of subexponential-growth-models for assessing the spread of COVID-19.","Heider, Philipp",,575,1

However, the clinical characteristics and outcomes remain unclear. In this study, 102 cases of COVID-19 from January 22, 2020 to March 26, 2020 in Xixi Hospital of Hangzhou were included. Twenty cases had pre-existing CCVD. Results showed that compared with non-CCVD patients, those with CCVD are more likely to develop severe disease (15% versus 1%), and the proportion of pneumonia severity index grade IV was significantly higher (25% versus 3.6%). Computed tomography images demonstrated that the proportion of multiple lobe lesion involvement was significantly higher in the CCVD group than in the non-CCVD group (90% versus 63.4%). Compared with non-CCVD group, the levels of C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, D-dimer, and serum amyloid-A were higher, whereas the total protein and arterial partial PaO2 were lower in the CCVD group. Although no statistical difference was observed in the outcomes between groups, CCVD patients received more intensive comprehensive treatment to improve COVID-19 symptoms compared with non-CCVD patients. Integrated Chinese and Western medicine treatments have certain advantages in controlling the severe conversion rate and mortality of COVID-19. In addition, given that COVID-19 patients are usually related to coagulation disorders and thrombosis risk, the application of Chinese medicine in promoting blood circulation and removing stasis should be strengthened.","Wang, Yu; Li, Lan; Pan, Yuanjiang; He, Yu; Chen, Zuhua; Xun, Yunhao; Xu, Yuhan; Guo, Yilei; Yang, Jiehong; Guo, Jianchun; Wan, Haitong",Front.

We report a structure-driven degradation mechanism for NMC811 (LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2), in which a proportion of the material exhibits a lowered accessible state of charge at the end of charging after repetitive cycling and becomes fatigued. Operando synchrotron long-duration X-ray diffraction enabled by a laser-thinned coin cell shows the emergence and growth in the concentration of this fatigued phase with cycle number. This degradation is structure driven and is not solely due to kinetic limitations or intergranular cracking: no bulk phase transformations, no increase in Li/Ni antisite mixing and no notable changes in the local structure or Li-ion mobility of the bulk are seen in aged NMCs. Instead, we propose that this degradation stems from the high interfacial lattice strain between the reconstructed surface and the bulk layered structure that develops when the latter is at states of charge above a distinct threshold of approximately 75%. This mechanism is expected to be universal in Ni-rich layered cathodes. Our findings provide fundamental insights into strategies to help mitigate this degradation process.","Xu, Chao; Märker, Katharina; Lee, Juhan; Mahadevegowda, Amoghavarsha; Reeves, Philip J; Day, Sarah J; Groh, Matthias F; Emge, Steffen P; Ducati, Caterina; Layla Mehdi, B; Tang, Chiu C; Grey, Clare P",Nat. materials,575,1

METHODS: A total of 1270 COVID-19 patients, including 984 admitted in Sino French New City Branch (training and internal validation sets randomly split at 7:3 ratio) and 286 admitted in Optical Valley Branch (external validation set) of Wuhan Tongji hospital, were included in this study. Forty-eight clinical and laboratory features were screened with LASSO method. Further multi-tree extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine learning-based model was used to rank importance of features selected from LASSO and subsequently constructed death risk prediction model with simple-tree XGBoost model. Performances of models were evaluated by AUC, prediction accuracy, precision, and F1 scores. RESULTS: Six features, including disease severity, age, levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ferritin, and interleukin-10 (IL-10), were selected as predictors for COVID-19 mortality. Simple-tree XGBoost model conducted by these features can predict death risk accurately with >90% precision and >85% sensitivity, as well as F1 scores >0.90 in training and validation sets.

The peaks of imported COVID-19 cases from Hubei occurred earlier than the peak of COVID-19 incidences in two cities, and the peak of imported cases from Hubei occurred earlier in Wenzhou than in Guangzhou. In early epidemic phase, imported cases were predominant in both cities, then the number of local cases increased and gradually took the dominance in Wenzhou. In Guangzhou, the imported cases was still predominant. Despite the different epidemic pattern, the R t and the number of COVID-19 cases declined after strict prevention and control measures were taken in Guangzhou and in Wenzhou. Conclusion The time and scale specific differences of imported COVID-19 resulted in different epidemic patterns in two cities, but the spread of the disease were effectively controlled after taking strict prevention and control measures.","Guanhao, HE; RONG, Zuhua; Jianxiong, HU; LIU, Tao; XIAO, Jianpeng; GUO, Lingchuan; ZENG, Weilin; ZHU, Zhihua; GONG, Dexin; YIN, Lihua; WAN, Donghua; Junle, WU; KANG, Min; SONG, Tie; Jianfeng, HE; Wenjun, MA",Chinese Journal of Epidemiology,575,17

During the current COVID-19 pandemic, several prophylactic doses and types of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) are being used worldwide; however, there are no high-quality studies or recommendations for an optimal prophylactic LMWH dose. OBJECTIVES: Investigate the relationship between coagulation parameters and the LMWH dose, and mortality and ICU admission in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. DESIGN: Retrospective. SETTING: Tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data on clinical features, coagulation parameters and anticoagulant medications of inpatients with severe COVID-19 were collected for the period between 11 March 2020 and 31 April 2020. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mortality and ICU admission for prophylactic dose LMWH (0.5 mg/kg twice daily) and therapeutic dose LMWH (1 mg/kg twice daily). SAMPLE SIZE: 154 cases. RESULTS: Ninety-eight (63.6%) patients were treated with the LMWH prophylactic dose and 56 (36.4%) patients were treated with the therapeutic dose. Forty-four (44.9%) of 98 patients using the prophylactic dose LMWH died, while 10 (17.9%) of 56 patients using the therapeutic dose LMWH died (P=.001). Mortality was 6.4-fold higher in the prophylactic dose LMWH users than in the therapeutic dose LMWH users (OR=6.5, 95% CI: 2.4-17.6, P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic dosing of LMWH may decrease mortality in patients with severe COVID-19 infected pneumonia. More aggressive thromboprophylaxis regimens using higher doses of heparin should be evaluated in prospective studies. LIMITATIONS: Lack of information about bleeding complications. LMWH was not compared with other anticoagulant therapies. There was no comparison between our two groups on the APACHE score. Used different doses of LMWH in different clinics in our hospital.

Five years into the journey towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the continent – similar to the rest of the world – has been gripped with the Corona virus disease pandemic that has caused significant morbidity and mortality as well as severely disrupted health systems and the underlying so-cioeconomic determinants of health. One of the most significant SDG targets is the achievement of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) where all people have access to quality health services they need without inflicting a financial hardship on them. However, progress towards this target has been slow on the continent and requires rethinking the current approaches employed. We argue that Africa’s key strength lies in the communities whose potential should be unlocked to build cost effective and sustainable bottom-up health systems founded on Primary Health Care (PHC). Such systems should be founded on community-based services, designed around individuals, families and the community involving community health workers and other actors, and capitalis-ing on health promotion and disease prevention approaches. A strong community health system should be adequately linked to district, regional and national levels working together to empower and serve populations to make health for all a reality. © 2021 Ndejjo et al.","Ndejjo, R.; Musinguzi, G.; Musoke, D.; Wanyenze, R.

This retrospective study included patients without comorbidities, who recovered from COVID-19 and attended an outpatient clinic at a university hospital for follow-up care and potential convalescent plasma donation. Network analysis was applied to visualize symptom combinations and persistent symptoms. Comprehensive lab-testing was ascertained at each follow-up to analyze differences regarding patients with vs without persistent symptoms. 116 patients were included, age range was 18-69 years (median: 41) with follow-ups ranging from 22 to 102 days. The three most frequent persistent symptoms were Fatigue (54%), Dyspnea (29%) and Anosmia (25%). Lymphopenia was present in 13 of 112 (12%) cases. Five of 35 cases (14%) had Lymphopenia in the later follow-up range of 80-102 days. Serum IgA concentration was the only lab parameter with significant difference between patients with vs without persistent symptoms with reduced serum IgA concentrations in the patient cohort of persistent symptoms (p = 0.0219). Moreover, subgroup analyses showed that patients with lymphopenia experienced more frequently persistent symptoms. In conclusion, lymphopenia persisted in a noticeable percentage of recovered patients. Patients with persistent symptoms had significantly lower serum IgA levels. Furthermore, our data provides evidence that lymphopenia is associated with persistence of COVID-19 symptoms.","Varghese, Julian; Sandmann, Sarah; Ochs, Kevin; Schrempf, Inga-Marie; Frömmel, Christopher; Dugas, Martin; Schmidt, Hartmut H; Vollenberg, Richard; Tepasse, Phil-Robin",Sci Rep,575,2

In this paper, we planned and carried out a delay measurement experiment using Raspberry Pi Zero W. The results demonstrated that, in low-energy ad-hoc networks, processing delay of the application is always too large to ignore; it is at least ten times greater than the kernel routing and corresponds to 30% of the transmission delay. Furthermore, if the task is CPU-intensive, such as packet encryption, the processing delay can be greater than the transmission delay and its behavior is represented by a simple linear model. Our findings indicate that the key factor for achieving QoS in ad-hoc networks is an appropriate node-to-node load balancing that takes into account the CPU performance and the amount of traffic passing through each node.","Miya, Taichi; Ohshima, Kohta; Kitaguchi, Yoshiaki; Yamaoka, Katsunori",,575,24

Methods: Between January 2018 and June 2019, 15 patients underwent ACL revision with double-bundle ACL reconstruction combined with ALL reconstruction. There were 12 males and 3 females with an average age of 30.1 years (range, 17-49 years). The technique of primary ACL reconstruction included single-bundle reconstruction in 13 cases and double-bundle reconstruction in 2 cases. These reconstructions applied autografts in 14 cases and allograft in 1 case. The causes of ACL reconstruction failure were identified as traumatic rupture in 9 cases and non-traumatic failure in 6 cases, including 2 cases of graft absorption and 3 cases of graft laxity. The average time from the primary ACL reconstruction to revision was 28.5 months (range, 8-60 months). The subjective and objective indicators of knee joint function were compared before operation and at last follow-up to evaluate the effectiveness. The subjective indicators included International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Lysholm score, and Tegner score. The objective indicators included anterior tibial translation (dynamic and static) and side-to-side difference (SSD), pivot-shift test, Lachman test, the difference of single-legged hop test, and the loss ratio of extensor muscle strength on the affected side. Results: All incisions healed by first intetion, and no complications such as infection, venous thrombosis of lower extremity, or neurovascular injury occurred. All patients were followed up for an average of 19.1 months (range, 12-30 months). At last follow-up, all patients had returned to pre-injury sports level. The IKDC score, Lysholm score, and Tegner score were significantly improved ( P<0.05); anterior tibial translations (dynamic and static) significantly decreased when compared with preoperative one ( P<0.05) and returned to the physiological range. The SSD, Lachman test, pivot-shift test, the difference of single-legged hop test, and the loss ratio of extensor muscle strength on the affected side were significantly better than those before operation ( P<0.05).During the follow-up, there was no re-rupture of the graft, no stiffness of the knee joint and limitation of mobility; 1 case had a protruding femoral end compression screw, which was removed through the original incision under local anesthesia. Conclusion: Double-bundle ACL reconstruction combined with ALL reconstruction can significantly improve the knee function in revision patients with ACL graft failure. It can reduce the anterior translation of tibia, and effectively prevent postoperative rotational instability of the knee.","Mao, Yunhe; Sun, Weihao; Fu, Weili; Li, Jian",Zhongguo Xiu Fu Chong Jian Wai Ke Za Zhi,575,16

During outbreaks, health care workers are submitted to an enormous emotional burden as they must balance the fundamental ""duty to treat"" with their parallel duties to family and loved ones. The aims of our study were to evaluate disease perceptions, levels of stress, emotional distress, and coping strategies among medical staff (COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 departments) in a tertiary pulmonology teaching hospital in the first month after the outbreak of COVID-19. One hundred and fifteen health care workers completed four validated questionnaires (the brief illness perception questionnaire, perceived stress scale, the profile of emotional distress emotional, and the cognitive coping evaluation questionnaire) that were afterwards interpreted by one psychologist. There was a high level of stress and psychological distress among health care workers in the first month after the pandemic outbreak. Interestingly, there were no differences between persons that worked in COVID-19 departments versus those working in non-COVID-19 departments. Disease perceptions and coping mechanisms were similar in the two groups. As coping mechanisms, refocusing on planning and positive reappraisal were used more than in the general population. There is no difference in disease perceptions, levels of stress, emotional distress, and coping strategies in medical staff handling COVID-19 patients versus those staff who were not handling COVID-19 patients in the first month after the pandemic outbreak.","Man, Milena Adina; Toma, Claudia; Motoc, Nicoleta Stefania; Necrelescu, Octavia Luiza; Bondor, Cosmina Ioana; Chis, Ana Florica; Lesan, Andrei; Pop, Carmen Monica; Todea, Doina Adina; Dantes, Elena; Puiu, Ruxandra; Rajnoveanu, Ruxandra-Mioara",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),575,7

However, it is unknown if seronegative patients develop at least a cellular response that could offer a certain grade of protection against SARS-CoV-2. To answer this question, we prospectively studied 148 recipients of either kidney (133) or kidney-pancreas (15) grafts with assessment of IgM/IgG spike (S) antibodies and ELISpot against the nucleocapside (N) and the S protein at baseline and two weeks after receiving the second dose of the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vaccine. At baseline, 31 patients (20.9%) had either IgM/IgG or ELISpot positivity and were considered to be SARS-CoV-2-pre-immunized, while 117 (79.1%) patients had no signs of either cellular or humoral response and were considered SARS-CoV-2-naïve. After vaccination, naïve patients who developed either humoral or cellular response were finally 65.0%, of which 29.9% developed either IgG or IgM and 35.0% S-ELISpot positivity. Factors associated with vaccine unresponsiveness were diabetes and treatment with anti-thymocytes globulins during the last year. Side effects were consistent with that of the pivotal trial and no DSAs developed after vaccination. In conclusion, mRNA-1273 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine elicits either cellular or humoral response in almost two thirds of KTRs.","Cucchiari, David; Egri, Natalia; Bodro, Marta; Herrera, Sabina; Del Risco-Zevallos, Jimena; Casals-Urquiza, Joaquim; Cofan, Frederic; Moreno, Asunción; Rovira, Jordi; Banon-Maneus, Elisenda; Ramirez-Bajo, Maria J; Ventura-Aguiar, Pedro; Pérez-Olmos, Anna; Garcia-Pascual, Marta; Pascal, Mariona; Vilella, Anna; Trilla, Antoni; Ríos, José; Palou, Eduard; Juan, Manel; Bayés, Beatriu; Diekmann, Fritz",Am. j. transplant,575,1

The European Unions Green Deal, a 'generation defining'growth strategy, which lays down the strategic pathway of the European Union's economic development for the upcoming two decades, has been faced with a major challenge shortly after its adoption in December 2019. However, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, which has continuously been putting all European Union member states to a harsh challenge during the past year, climate change and the green transition have been at the top of the political agenda in the European Union and have managed to occupy the attention of the mainstream politics and European Union citizens. Furthermore, the unprecedented levels of public financing which have been mobilised due to the pandemic have provided an opportunity for speeding up the green transition, without which the achievement of the Green Deal's main aims and the fulfilment of the European Union's obligations under the Paris Agreement would likely be put in question. In order to analyse how the has the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the implementation of the Green Deal, the paper first examines how the member states and the European Union institutions initially reacted to the idea of pursuing the implementation of the Green Deal simultaneously with economic recovery. This is accomplished through an analysis of statements given by the European Union and member state officials and the adopted measures and legislativeproposals. The paper then focuses on publicly available data on legislative delays in regard to the implementation of the Green Deal which took place due to the pandemic and concludes that no significant postponements occurred. It subsequently turns to examine which measures have been adopted at the European Union level that link the economic recovery and the green transition. In this regard, special attention is paid to the Recovery and Resilience Facility and its measures aimed at ensuring that member states pursue climate change and environmental objectives in their recovery plans. Given the size of the public investments which will take place in the following years, the paper emphasises the importance of stringent environmental standards in order to ensure that they contribute to the green transition and avoid a fossil fuel lock-in.","Carević, Melita PhD Assistant Professor",EU and Comparative Law Issues and Challenges Series,575,16

However, little has been reported regarding the impact on blood utilization. We quantified the impact of COVID-19 on blood utilization and discards among facilities reporting to the National Healthcare Safety Network Hemovigilance Module. METHODS: Facilities continuously reporting data, during January 2016-June 2020, on transfused and discarded blood components, stratified by component type (red blood cells [RBC], platelets, and plasma), were included. Interrupted time-series analysis with generalized estimating equations, adjusting for facility surgical volume and seasonality, was used to quantify changes in blood utilization and discards relative to a Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services notification delaying nonessential medical procedures (March 2020). RESULTS: Seventy-two facilities included in the analyses, on average, transfused 44,548 and discarded 2,202 blood components monthly. Following the March 2020 notification and after multivariable adjustment, RBC and platelet utilization declined, -9.9% (p < .001) and -13.6% (p = .014), respectively. Discards increased for RBCs (30.2%, p = .047) and platelets (60.4%, p = .002). No statistically significant change in plasma was found. Following these abrupt changes, blood utilization and discards rebounded toward baseline with RBC utilization increasing by 5.7% (p < .001), and platelet and RBC discards decreasing -16.4% (<0.001) and -12.7 (p = .001), respectively. CONCLUSION: Following notification delaying elective surgical procedures, blood utilization declined substantially while blood discards increased, resulting in substantial wastage of blood products. Ongoing and future pandemic response efforts should consider the impact of interventions on blood supply and demand to ensure blood availability.","Kracalik, Ian; Mowla, Sanjida; Katz, Louis; Cumming, Melissa; Sapiano, Matthew R P; Basavaraju, Sridhar V",Transfusion,575,1

As the virus SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread globally, variants have emerged, characterized by multiple mutations of the S glycoprotein. Herein, we employed microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulations to study the impact of the mutations of the S glycoprotein in SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern 202012/01 (B.1.1.7), termed the ""UK variant"", in comparison with the wild type, with the aim to decipher the structural basis of the reported increased infectivity and virulence. The simulations provided insights on the different dynamics of UK and wild-type S glycoprotein, regarding in particular the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD). In addition, we investigated the role of glycans in modulating the conformational transitions of the RBD. The overall results showed that the UK mutant experiences higher flexibility in the RBD with respect to wild type; this behavior might be correlated with the increased transmission reported for this variant.

These four genes were named SULT1C1, SULT1C2, SULT1C3P, and SULT1C5, according to the sequence homology and gene location. Since SULT1C5 is the orthologous gene for human SULT1C2P, we propose, here, to revisit the designation of human SULT1C2P to SULT1C5P. Purified recombinant SULT1C enzymes showed sulfating activities toward a variety of xenobiotic compounds and thyroid hormones. Kinetic analysis revealed high catalytic activities of SULT1C1 and SULT1C5 for 3,3'-T2.

Despite the progress made in the development of the vaccine, there is an urge need for the discovery of antivirals that may better work at different stages of SARS-CoV-2 reproduction. The main protease (Mpro) of the SARS-CoV-2 is a crucial therapeutic target due to its critical function in virus replication. The &#945;-ketoamide derivatives represent an important class of inhibitors against the Mpro of the SARS-CoV. While there is 99% sequence similarity between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 main proteases, anti-SARS-CoV compounds may have a huge demonstration's prospect of their effectiveness against the SARS-CoV-2. In this study, we applied various computational approaches to investigate the inhibition potency of novel designed &#945;-ketoamide-based compounds. In this regard, a set of 21 &#945;-ketoamides was employed to construct a QSAR model, using the genetic algorithm-multiple linear regression (GA-MLR), as well as a pharmacophore fit model. Based on the GA-MLR model, 713 new designed molecules were reduced to 150 promising hits, which were later subject to the established pharmacophore fit model. Among the 150 compounds, the best selected compounds (3 hits) with greater pharmacophore fit score were further studied via molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations along with the Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) analysis.

For supervised machine learning, we use convolutional neural networks and find that the corresponding output not only allows to locate the phase transition point with high precision, it also displays a finite-size scaling characterized by an Ising critical exponent. For unsupervised learning, restricted Boltzmann machines (RBM) are trained to generate new configurations that are then used to compute various quantities. We find that RBM generates configurations with magnetizations and energies forbidden in the original physical system. The RBM generated configurations result in energy density probability distributions with incorrect weights as well as in wrong spatial correlations. We show that shortcomings are also encountered when training RBM with configurations obtained from the non-conserved Ising model.","Azizi, Ahmadreza; Pleimling, Michel",Sci Rep,575,20

Compared to adults, the most significant change in viral disease manifestation is encompassed by the multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C). MIS-C is a new inflammatory syndrome which develops 2-4 weeks after COVID-19 exposure, with evidence suggesting it is a post-infectious immune reaction. We describe its epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis (which varies based on definition used) and treatment options based on published recommendations. A systematic literature search we conducted through MEDLINE yielded 518 abstracts and identified five studies that reported more than 100 cases of MIS-C and their mortality. Most cases developed multiorgan dysfunction, including cardiovascular, dermatologic, neurological, renal, and respiratory issues, and required intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Many patients admitted to the ICU needed inotrope support and invasive mechanical ventilation, and the most severe cases required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support. Most clinicians treated MIS-C with intravenous immunoglobulin, systemic steroids, and biological therapies. Overall mortality was low (2-3%) in all studies. Further research is needed to: understand if early intervention can prevent its progression; optimize its treatment; and improve outcomes of this new syndrome for the patients who develop MIS-C.","Shioji, Naohiro; Aoyama, Kazuyoshi; Englesakis, Marina; Annich, Gail; Maynes, Jason T",J Anesth,575,1

Chronic cough, usually defined by cough duration longer than 8 weeks in adults, is prevalent in the community and impairs quality of life in individual patients. There are several characteristics that may differentiate pathologic coughs from protective cough responses, including cough duration, frequency, hypersensitivity, impaired cough suppressibility, or treatment refractoriness. However, the impact of cough, or its perceived severity, is a sum of the patient's experience of coughing and is a factor that may finally define cough as a disease. Social isolation is a major impact of chronic cough, which is now worse due to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and a widespread fear of cough as a source of contagion. Emotional impact and economic impact (medical cost, reduced work productivity, and job loss) are also important complications of chronic cough, and they interact in a vicious cycle, aggravated by social isolation and treatment failures. This paper is a narrative review that aims to address the impact and disease burden of chronic cough in adult patients. We review the literature, but also introduce the findings from recent qualitative interviews and the patients' experiences of the impact and burden of chronic cough and discuss unmet needs in these patients.","Won, H.

When the observed variables are collected at various occasions on the same statistical units, the data have a three-way structure and standard factor analysis may fail. To overcome these limitations, three-way models, such as the Parafac model, can be adopted. It is often seen as an extension of principal component analysis able to discover unique latent components. The structural version, i.e., as a reparameterization of the covariance matrix, has been also formulated but rarely investigated. In this article, such a formulation is studied by discussing under what conditions factor uniqueness is preserved. It is shown that, under mild conditions, such a property holds even if the specific factors are assumed to be within-variable, or within-occasion, correlated and the model is modified to become scale invariant.","Giordani, Paolo; Rocci, Roberto; Bove, Giuseppe",Psychometrika,575,24

Currently, there is limited research examining how these populations engage in and navigate challenges relating to exercise during shelter-in-place mandates and no studies examining the role of social support in promoting exercise during the pandemic. In this study, we examine perceptions of social support during the COVID-19 pandemic among members who belong to a fitness community based in Oakland, California. In-depth interviews (n = 31) were used to understand how the pandemic has affected participants' perceptions of current exercise habits and how understandings of social support facilitate engagement in physical activity. Reported narratives encompassed two primary themes: (1) Facilitators of Social Support and (2) Challenges and Barriers to Social Support.

The paired dependent data structure, which are the births and deaths in persistent diagrams, adds complexity to statistical inference. In this paper, we present a new lattice path representation for persistent diagrams. A new exact statistical inference procedure is developed for lattice paths via combinatorial enumerations. The proposed lattice path method is applied to study the topological characterization of the protein structures of the COVID-19 virus. We demonstrate that there are topological changes during the conformational change of spike proteins, a necessary step in infecting host cells.","Chung, M. K.; Ombao, H.",,575,10

However, structural information of the post-fusion S2 from these highly pathogenic human-infecting coronaviruses is still lacking. We used single-particle cryo-electron microscopy to show that the post-fusion SARS-CoV S2 forms a further rotated HR1-HR2 six-helix bundle and a tightly bound linker region upstream of the HR2 motif. The structures of pre- and post-fusion SARS-CoV S glycoprotein dramatically differ, resembling that of the Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and other class I viral fusion proteins.

This analysis included the change of monthly headache days (MHD) in the observation period compared to baseline. We also assessed changes in monthly migraine days (MMD), the use of acute medication, and pain intensity. In addition, we looked into the changes in sleep duration, sleep quality, energy level, mood, stress, and activity level. Outcomes were compared using paired t-tests.

MMD, headache and migraine intensity neither showed any significant changes. Days with acute medication use were reduced from 4.50 ± 3.88 in the baseline to 4.27 ± 3.81 in the observation period (p < 0.001). The app users reported reduced stress levels, longer sleep duration, reduced activity levels, along with a better mood, and an improved energy level during the first lockdown month (p &#8804; 0.001). In an extension analysis of users who continued to use M-sense every day for 3 months after initiation of lockdown, we compared the baseline and the subsequent months using repeated-measures ANOVA. In these 539 users, headache frequency did not change significantly neither (6.11 ± 5.10 MHD before lockdown vs. 6.07 ± 5.17 MHD in the third lockdown month, p = 0.688 in the ANOVA). Migraine frequency, headache and migraine intensity, and acute medication use were also not different during the entire observation period. CONCLUSION: Despite slight changes in factors that contribute to the generation of headache, COVID-19-related lockdown measures did not seem to be associated with primary headache frequency and intensity over the course of 3 months.","Raffaelli, Bianca; Mecklenburg, Jasper; Scholler, Simon; Overeem, Lucas Hendrik; Oliveira Gonçalves, Ana Sofia; Reuter, Uwe; Neeb, Lars",J Headache Pain,575,6

METHODS: In this study, we compare DETECTR with qRT-PCR to diagnose coronavirus disease 2019 on 378 patient samples. Patient sample dilution assays suggest a higher analytical sensitivity of DETECTR compared with qRT-PCR; however, this was not confirmed in this large patient cohort, where we report 95% reproducibility between the 2 tests. RESULTS: These data showed that both techniques are equally sensitive in detecting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) providing additional value of DETECTR to the currently used qRT-PCR platforms. For DETECTR, different guide ribonucleic acids can be used simultaneously to obviate negative results due to mutations in N-gene. Lateral flow strips, suitable as a point-of-care test, showed a 100% correlation to the high-throughput DETECTR assay. More importantly, DETECTR was 100% specific for SARS-CoV-2 relative to other human coronaviruses. CONCLUSIONS: Because there is no need for specialized equipment, DETECTR could be rapidly implemented as a complementary technically independent approach to qRT-PCR thereby increasing the testing capacity of medical microbiological laboratories and relieving the existent PCR platforms for routine non-SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing.","Brandsma, Eelke; Verhagen, Han J M P; van de Laar, Thijs J W; Claas, Eric C J; Cornelissen, Marion; van den Akker, Emile",J Infect Dis,575,16

This study aimed to examine: (1) which specific aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic were associated with the presence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and (2) the extent to which participants' hopelessness and resilience moderated the relationship between COVID-19 related stress and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. METHOD: We administered an online survey to 12,989 adult (16+) participants across Wales from the 9th June to the 13th July 2020. Participants completed a series of questionnaires measuring the stressors they had experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, their levels of hopelessness over the past two weeks, their levels of resilience, and whether they had experienced suicidal thoughts or behaviors since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Our findings revealed that: (1) food insecurity, domestic abuse, relationship problems, redundancy, social isolation and financial problems were the COVID-19 related stressors most strongly associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors, and (2) that both hopelessness and resilience moderated the relationship between COVID-19 stress and suicidal thoughts, such that the relationship between COVID-19 stress and the presence of suicidal thoughts was much stronger for individuals with high hopelessness and low resilience. CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic that are closely related to suicidal thoughts and behaviors and demonstrate the important role that hope for the future and resilience play in protecting individuals against the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.HighlightsStressors caused by the pandemic are linked to increased suicidal thoughts.Hope protects individuals against the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.Resilience also protects people from the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.","Knowles, James R P; Gray, Nicola S; O039,; Connor, Chris; Pink, Jennifer; Simkiss, Nicola J; Snowden, Robert J",Arch Suicide Res,575,13

A scoping review was performed, where 10 papers were identified as specifically addressing the assessment of timing of commensality of meals. Time use studies, questionnaires, and telephone- and person-to-person interviews were used for assessing meal times in relation to commensality. Four of the studies used a method of time use registration, and six papers used interviews or questionnaires. Common meals with family members were the most common, and dinners late at night were often preferred for commensal activities among the working population. In conclusion, the family meal seemed to be the most important commensal meal. It is clear from the collected papers and from previous systematic reviews that more studies of commensal meals in general and about timing aspects in particular and in relation to nutritional health are essential to provide a solid background of knowledge regarding the importance of timing in relation to commensal meals.","Scander, Henrik; Lennernäs Wiklund, Maria; Yngve, Agneta",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online),575,24

Yet, other studies have been unable to detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in skin biopsies of ""COVID toes"" by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction testing. OBJECTIVE: In order to address these apparently conflicting findings, we compared detection of SARS-CoV-2 SP, through RNA in situ hybridization (ISH) vs immunohistochemistry (IHC), in skin biopsies of acral perniotic lesions presenting during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: Three of six cases showed positive immunohistochemical labeling of endothelial cells, with one of three cases with sufficient depth also having labeling of eccrine glands, using an anti-SP SARS-CoV-2 antibody. These three cases positive with IHC were negative for SP by RNA ISH. CONCLUSION: While the gold standard for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in tissue sections has yet to be determined, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 SP alone without spike RNA suggests that cleaved SP may be present in cutaneous endothelial cells and eccrine epithelium, providing a potential pathogenetic mechanism of COVID-19 endotheliitis.","Ko, Christine J; Harigopal, Malini; Gehlhausen, Jeff R; Bosenberg, Marcus; McNiff, Jennifer M; Damsky, William",J. cutan. pathol,575,32

Although there are ongoing clinical trials to test the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis, there has not been any proposal to test the efficacy of IFN &#945;-2b together with hydroxychloroquine to increase protection against COVID-19.

METHODS: Medications under investigation as novel therapeutics to treat COVID-19 were identified using the search term coronavirus therapeutics, COVID therapeutics, and SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics on ClinicalTrials.gov and the PubMed Database. A literature review was performed using the PubMed Database for each proposed COVID-19 therapeutic to identify relevant articles. Search criteria included Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and key word search terms for ototoxicity, vestibulotoxicity, hearing disorders, and vertigo. RESULTS: Six proposed COVID-19 therapeutics were identified as possessing ototoxic side effects including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir-ritonavir, interferon, ribavirin, and ivermectin. CONCLUSIONS: Available evidence suggests that ototoxic effects may be improved or mitigated by stopping the offending agent. Recognition of hearing loss, tinnitus, or imbalance/vertigo is therefore crucial to facilitate early intervention and prevent long-term damage.

Anti-SARS-CoV-2 NP antibody in serum or plasma samples was captured by protein G-coated microtiter plate and detected using the crude cell lysates expressing Nanoluc luciferase (Nluc) enzyme fused with SARS-CoV-2 NP. After the addition of furimazine substrate, the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 NP IgG antibody were quantitatively measured as luciferase light units.

The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) plays a critical function in replicating the genome of all RNA viruses and is one of the most intensively studied viral enzyme targets for the development of direct-acting antiviral therapeutics. Comparisons of recently determined cryo-EM structures of the SARS CoV-2 RdRP with crystal structures of calicivirus, picornavirus and flavivirus RdRP's in complex with RNA and nucleoside analogue inhibitors suggest how differences in the sequences and structures of these RdRPs may result in differences in the activity of the enzyme as well as its sensitivity to different inhibitors. Molecular modeling, crystallographic studies and in vitro primer extension assays reveal how chimeric RdRPs bearing different sequence features from the RdRPs of SARS CoV-2 and human norovirus GII.4 may contribute to differences in polymerase activity and the effects of nucleoside analogue inhibitors. These results suggest how some of the structural features of viral RdRPs may be productively targeted for the design of novel and more potent inhibitors to serve as lead compounds for the development of more effective antiviral therapeutics in the future.","Sharlin, Noga Campo Lucas Rehman Fasih Ng Kenneth",The FASEB Journal,575,1

Therefore and in response to a short-term shortage of PCR reagents, we evaluated DiaSorin's LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 antigen test in comparison to RT-qPCR, and concerning the application of screening non-COVID-19 patients on hospital admission. Applying the manufacturer-recommended cut-off of 200 arbitrary units (AU/mL) the specificity of the LIAISON Test was 100%, the overall analytical sensitivity 40.2%. Lowering the cut-off to 100 AU/mL increased the sensitivity to 49.7% and decreased the specificity to 98.3%. Confining the analysis to samples with an RT-qPCR result < 25 Ct resulted in a sensitivity of 91.2%. The quality of the LIAISON test is very similar to that of good RATs described in the literature with the advantage of high throughput and the disadvantage of relatively long analysis time. It passes the WHO quality criteria for rapid antigen tests and is characterized by particularly high specificity. The LIAISON test can therefore be used for the same applications as recommended for RATs by the WHO. Due to limited sensitivity, the LIAISON test should only be used for screening, if PCR-based assays are not available.","Häuser, Friederike; Sprinzl, Martin F; Dreis, Kim J; Renzaho, Angelique; Youhanen, Simon; Kremer, Wolfgang M; Podlech, Jürgen; Galle, Peter R; Lackner, Karl J; Rossmann, Heidi; Lemmermann, Niels A",Med Microbiol Immunol,575,10

No specific treatments exist for COVID-19 at this time. New evidence suggests that therapeutic options focusing on antiviral agents may alleviate COVID-19 symptoms as well as those that lead to the decrease in the inflammatory responses. Flavonoids, as phenolic compounds, have attracted considerable attention due to their various biological properties. In this review, the promising effects and possible mechanisms of action of naringenin, a citrus-derived flavonoid, against COVID-19 were discussed. We searched PubMed/Medline, Science direct, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases up to March 2020 using the definitive keywords. The evidence reviewed here indicates that naringenin might exert therapeutic effects against COVID-19 through the inhibition of COVID-19 main protease, 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), and reduction of angiotensin converting enzyme receptors activity. One of the other mechanisms by which naringenin might exert therapeutic effects against COVID-19 is, at least partly, by attenuating inflammatory responses. The antiviral activity of the flavanone naringenin against some viruses has also been reported. On the whole, the favorable effects of naringenin lead to a conclusion that naringenin may be a promising treatment strategy against COVID-19.","Tutunchi, Helda; Naeini, Fatemeh; Ostadrahimi, Alireza; Hosseinzadeh-Attar, Mohammad Javad",Phytother Res,575,32

However, deep learning models usually need large labelled datasets to be effective. Semi-supervised deep learning is an attractive alternative, where unlabelled data is leveraged to improve the overall model's accuracy. However, in real-world usage settings, an unlabelled dataset might present a different distribution than the labelled dataset (i.e. the labelled dataset was sampled from a target clinic and the unlabelled dataset from a source clinic). This results in a distribution mismatch between the unlabelled and labelled datasets. In this work, we assess the impact of the distribution mismatch between the labelled and the unlabelled datasets, for a semi-supervised model trained with chest X-ray images, for COVID-19 detection. Under strong distribution mismatch conditions, we found an accuracy hit of almost 30\%, suggesting that the unlabelled dataset distribution has a strong influence in the behaviour of the model. Therefore, we propose a straightforward approach to diminish the impact of such distribution mismatch. Our proposed method uses a density approximation of the feature space. It is built upon the target dataset to filter out the observations in the source unlabelled dataset that might harm the accuracy of the semi-supervised model. It assumes that a small labelled source dataset is available together with a larger source unlabelled dataset. Our proposed method does not require any model training, it is simple and computationally cheap. We compare our proposed method against two popular state of the art out-of-distribution data detectors, which are also cheap and simple to implement. In our tests, our method yielded accuracy gains of up to 32\%, when compared to the previous state of the art methods.","Calderon-Ramirez, Saul; Yang, Shengxiang; Elizondo, David; Moemeni, Armaghan",,575,16

The synthesis of diagnostic evidence has important methodological challenges. Here, we performed an international survey to identify the current practice of producing RRs for diagnostic tests. METHODS: We developed and administered an online survey inviting institutions that perform RRs of diagnostic tests from all over the world. RESULTS: All participants (N = 25) reported the implementation of one or more methods to define the scope of the RR; however, only one strategy (defining a structured question) was used by &#8805;90% of participants. All participants used at least one methodological shortcut including the use of a previous review as a starting point (92%) and the use of limits on the search (96%). Parallelization and automation of review tasks were not extensively used (48 and 20%, respectively). CONCLUSION: Our survey indicates a greater use of shortcuts and limits for conducting diagnostic test RRs versus the results of a recent scoping review analyzing published RRs. Several shortcuts are used without knowing how their implementation affects the results of the evidence synthesis in the setting of diagnostic test reviews. Thus, a structured evaluation of the challenges and implications of the adoption of these RR methods is warranted.","Arevalo-Rodriguez, Ingrid; Steingart, Karen R; Tricco, Andrea C; Nussbaumer-Streit, Barbara; Kaunelis, David; Alonso-Coello, Pablo; Baxter, Susan; Bossuyt, Patrick M; Emparanza, José Ignacio; Zamora, Javier",BMC Med Res Methodol,575,16

Nevertheless, the workflows used differ depending on the applied camera, the plants being imaged, the experience of the users, and the measurement set-up. RESULTS: This review describes a general workflow for the assessment and processing of hyperspectral plant data at greenhouse and laboratory scale. Aiming at a detailed description of possible error sources, a comprehensive literature review of possibilities to overcome these errors and influences is provided. The processing of hyperspectral data of plants starting from the hardware sensor calibration, the software processing steps to overcome sensor inaccuracies, and the preparation for machine learning is shown and described in detail. Furthermore, plant traits extracted from spectral hypercubes are categorized to standardize the terms used when describing hyperspectral traits in plant phenotyping. A scientific data perspective is introduced covering information for canopy, single organs, plant development, and also combined traits coming from spectral and 3D measuring devices. CONCLUSIONS: This publication provides a structured overview on implementing hyperspectral imaging into biological studies at greenhouse and laboratory scale. Workflows have been categorized to define a trait-level scale according to their metrological level and the processing complexity. A general workflow is shown to outline procedures and requirements to provide fully calibrated data of the highest quality.

Our aim was to explore the degree of liver damage, liver stiffness (LS) and severity of illness in patients with COVID-19. DESIGN: We investigated 32 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the University Hospital of Innsbruck in a prospective cross-sectional study. We performed laboratory testing, liver and spleen sonography and elastography to measure organ stiffness. RESULTS: 12 patients (38%) showed elevated aminotransferases and gamma-glutamyltransferase levels. LS was positively correlated with elevated aminotransferase levels in patients with COVID-19 compared with those without elevated enzymes. Even mild liver damage raised LS significantly in COVID-19 as it was in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. Furthermore, higher LS measurements were significantly associated with illness severity like pneumonia, need for mechanical ventilation, and even death. CONCLUSION: Transient elastography is a useful and non-invasive tool to assess onset and severity of acute liver injury in patients with COVID-19 patients.

The carbon footprint is a measure of CO2 emissions released into the atmosphere, which increases day by day, causing glaciers to melt and increase sea level, reduce water resources, and global warming. For Turkey, as a country trying to complete its economic development, signed international agreements such as the Paris Climate Agreement and Kyoto Protocol to reduce the carbon footprint give great importance to the studies estimating carbon footprint and making policies to reduce it. For this reason, in this study it is aimed to estimate the greenhouse gas emissions of Turkey in the year 2030 and to determine its damages to the economy. Time series forecasting algorithm in the WEKA data mining software was used for analysis, and population, gross domestic product, energy production, and energy consumption were used as independent variables. As a result of analysis using data from the years 1990-2017, as long as Turkey continues its course of gradually increasing the amount of current greenhouse gas emissions in the year 2030, 728.3016 metric tons of CO2 equivalent will be reached. It appears that these estimates remain below the rate of Turkey's commitments at the Paris Climate Agreement that is considered to be promising for Turkey. However, the estimations in other studies should not be ignored; policy makers should determine policies accordingly.","Akyol, Müge; Uçar, Emine",,575,1

Interleukin (IL)-1 or IL-6 inhibitors have been used to treat this patient population, but the comparative effectiveness of these different strategies remains undetermined. We aimed to compare IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, and hyperinflammation. Methods: This cohort study included patients admitted to San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and hyperinflammation, defined as serum C-reactive protein concentration of 100 mg/L or more or ferritin concentration of 900 ng/mL or more. The primary endpoint was survival, and the secondary endpoint was a composite of death or mechanical ventilation (adverse clinical outcome). Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to compare clinical outcomes of patients receiving IL-1 inhibition (anakinra) or IL-6 inhibition (tocilizumab or sarilumab) with those of patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors, after accounting for baseline differences. All patients received standard care. Interaction tests were used to assess the probability of survival according to C-reactive protein or lactate dehydrogenase concentrations. Findings: Of 392 patients included between Feb 25 and May 20, 2020, 275 did not receive interleukin inhibitors, 62 received the IL-1 inhibitor anakinra, and 55 received an IL-6 inhibitor (29 received tocilizumab and 26 received sarilumab). In the multivariable analysis, compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors, patients treated with IL-1 inhibition had a significantly reduced mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0·450, 95% CI 0·204-0·990, p=0·047), but those treated with IL-6 inhibition did not (0·900, 0·412-1·966; p=0·79). In the multivariable analysis, there was no difference in adverse clinical outcome risk in patients treated with IL-1 inhibition (HR 0·866, 95% CI 0·482-1·553; p=0·63) or IL-6 inhibition (0·882, 0·452-1·722; p=0·71) relative to patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. For increasing C-reactive protein concentrations, patients treated with IL-6 inhibition had a significantly reduced risk of mortality (HR 0·990, 95% CI 0·981-0·999; p=0·031) and adverse clinical outcome (0·987, 0·979-0·995; p=0·0021) compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. For decreasing concentrations of serum lactate dehydrogenase, patients treated with an IL-1 inhibitor and patients treated with IL-6 inhibitors had a reduced risk of mortality; increasing concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase in patients receiving either interleukin inhibitor were associated with an increased risk of mortality (HR 1·009, 95% CI 1·003-1·014, p=0·0011 for IL-1 inhibitors and 1·006, 1·001-1·011, p=0·028 for IL-6 inhibitors) and adverse clinical outcome (1·006, 1·002-1·010, p=0·0031 for IL-1 inhibitors and 1·005, 1·001-1·010, p=0·016 for IL-6 inhibitors) compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. Interpretation: IL-1 inhibition, but not IL-6 inhibition, was associated with a significant reduction of mortality in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, and hyperinflammation. IL-6 inhibition was effective in a subgroup of patients with markedly high C-reactive protein concentrations, whereas both IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition were effective in patients with low lactate dehydrogenase concentrations.

We set up a smartphone-based hybrid model of teledermatology services providing direct care to patients at our center. To analyse patient and physician-experience and acceptability for teledermatology over a 6-month-period, along with clinicodemographic profile of patients. METHODOLOGY: Single-center, retrospective study conducted from May 20, 2020 to October 31, 2020. Patient satisfaction level for teledermatology was assessed on a 4-point scale and compared with the satisfaction level during their previous physical visits prior to COVID-19 pandemic. A physician assessment form was utilised to record the experience of dermatologists while providing teledermatology services. RESULTS: Of 7530 patients registered, a successful consult was provided to 6125 patients (81.34%). Average number of teleconsultations/day rose from 23.60 in May 2020 to 77.96 in October 2020. Mean age of patients availing teledermatology services was 33.60 ± 16.99 years. Average distance to care and travel time were 100.90 ± 171.77 km and 135 ± 222.32 min, respectively. A definitive diagnosis could be ascertained in 5724 patients (93.45%) and in-person visit was recommended to 133 patients (2.2%). Out of 6125 patients, 5229 could be contacted for feedback, 935 (18.18%), 2230 (42.65%), 1749 (33.45%), and 300 patients (5.70%) reported being very satisfied, satisfied, partially satisfied, and unsatisfied, respectively. Of 1914 patients, who had availed in-person OPD facilities prior to the pandemic, 914 patients (49.62%) preferred in-person visits. Of 34 dermatologists surveyed, 88.2% felt comfortable providing teleconsultations and 82.4% felt the need to continue teledermatology services in the upcoming months. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, teledermatology is a valid alternative for in-person dermatology visits during the current crisis; helping with initial triage and further patient management. Further refinement of the process could lead to even more acceptability.","Handa, Sanjeev; Mehta, Hitaishi; Bishnoi, Anuradha; Vinay, Keshavamurthy; Mahajan, Rahul; Narang, Tarun; Kumaran, Muthu Sendhil; De, Dipankar; Dogra, Sunil; Parsad, Davinder",Dermatol Ther,575,16

However, these exhibit substantial cytotoxicity. As this cytotoxicity may be attributed to 5'-phosphorylation, we designed and synthesized one-carbon homologated 6'-fluorinated-aristeromycin analogues. This modification prevents 5'-phosphorlyation by cellular kinases, whereas the inhibitory activity towards S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine (SAH) hydrolase will be retained. The enantiomerically pure 6'-fluorinated-5'-homoaristeromycin analogues 3a-e were synthesized via the electrophilic fluorination of the silyl enol ether with Selectfluor, using a base-build up approach as the key steps. All synthesized compounds exhibited potent inhibitory activity towards SAH hydrolase, among which 6'-ß-fluoroadenosine analogue 3a was the most potent (IC50 = 0.36 µM). Among the compounds tested, 6'-ß-fluoro-homoaristeromycin 3a showed potent antiviral activity (EC50 = 0.12 µM) against the CHIKV, without noticeable cytotoxicity up to 250 µM. Only 3a displayed anti-CHIKV activity, whereas both3a and 3b inhibited SAH hydrolase with similar IC50 values (0.36 and 0.37 µM, respectively), which suggested that 3a's antiviral activity did not merely depend on the inhibition of SAH hydrolase. This is further supported by the fact that the antiviral effect was specific for CHIKV and some other alphaviruses and none of the homologated analogues inhibited other RNA viruses, such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and ZIKV. The potent inhibition and high selectivity index make 6'-ß-fluoro-homoaristeromycin (3a) a promising new template for the development of antivirals against CHIKV, a serious re-emerging pathogen that has infected millions of people over the past 15 years.","Shin, Young Sup; Jarhad, Dnyandev B; Jang, Min Hwan; Kovacikova, Kristina; Kim, Gyudong; Yoon, Ji-Seong; Kim, Hong-Rae; Hyun, Young Eum; Tipnis, Amol S; Chang, Tong-Shin; van Hemert, Martijn J; Jeong, Lak Shin",Eur J Med Chem,575,16

Design/methodology/approach: A multivariate vector autoregression (VAR)-Baba, Engle, Kraft and Kroner generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity model (BEKK-GARCH) is used to assess volatility transmission across the examined markets. The sample is divided as follows. The first period ranging from 02/01/2019 to 10/03/2020 defines the pre-COVID-19 crisis. The second period is from 11/03/2020 to 05/10/2020, representing the COVID-19 crisis period. Then, a robustness test is used using exponential GARCH models after including an exogenous variable capturing the growth of COVID-19 confirmed death cases worldwide with the aim to test the accuracy of the VAR-BEKK-GARCH estimated results. Findings: Results indicate that the interconnectedness among the examined market has been intensified during the COVID-19 crisis, proving the lack of hedging opportunities. It is also found that stocks and Gold markets lead the crude oil market especially during the COVID-19 crisis, which explains the freefall of the crude oil price during the health crisis. Similarly, results show that Gold is most likely to act as a diversifier rather than a hedging tool during the current health crisis. Originality/value: Although the recent studies in the field focused on analyzing the relationships between different markets during the first quarter of 2020, this study considers a larger data set with the aim to assess the volatility transmission across the examined international markets Amid the COVID-19 crisis, while it shows the most significant impact on various financial markets compared to other diseases. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Ajmi, H.; Arfaoui, N.; Saci, K.",Studies in Economics and Finance,575,17

In Australia, the cruise ship Ruby Princess became the largest COVID-19 epicenter. When the Ruby Princess arrived at the Port of Sydney in New South Wales on March 19, 2020, approximately 2700 passengers disembarked. By March 24, about 130 had tested positive for COVID-19, and by March 27, the number had increased to 162. The purpose of this study is to analyze the relationship between the cruise industry and the COVID-19 outbreak. We take two perspectives: the first analysis focuses on the relationship between the estimated number of cruise passengers landing and the number of COVID-19 cases. We tracked the movement of all ocean cruise ships around the world using automatic identification system data from January to March 2020. We found that countries with arrival and departure ports and with ports that continued to accept cruise ships until March have a higher COVID-19 infection rate than countries that did not.

However, the mechanism(s) underlying the antiviral activity of IFITM proteins are not fully understood and most evidence comes from single-round pseudoparticle infection assays of cells artificially overexpressing IFITM proteins. Here, we examined whether and how endogenous IFITM proteins may affect infection by the novel pandemic coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. Methods: SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S) and ACE2 mediated pseudoparticle entry in HEK293T cells overexpressing IFITMs was quantified using luciferase reporter assays. To determine the role of IFITMs under more physiological conditions, we silenced IFITM protein expression in Calu-3 cells and in primary airway epithelial cells (SAEC) using siRNAs and infected them with genuine SARS-CoV-2. Viral entry and replication were quantified by qRT-PCR as well as plaque assays. To clarify whether IFITMs represent suitable therapeutic targets, we analyzed whether antibodies against IFITM proteins inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection of lung cells. Results: Our results show that overexpression of IFITM protein blocks ACE2 and SARS-CoV-2 Spike mediated pseudoparticle infection. In striking contrast, however, endogenous IFITM expression was required for efficient entry and replication of genuine SARS-CoV-2 in Calu-3 lung cells and primary lung cells both in the presence and absence of interferons. Efficient endogenous expression of IFITM1 and IFITm2 enhanced SARS-CoV-2 replication in Calu-3 and SAEC by several orders of magnitude. In addition, antibodies directed against IFITM proteins inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in lung cells. Conclusion: IFITM proteins are cofactors for efficient SARS-CoV-2 infection of human lung cells and represent novel, unexpected targets for the treatment of COVID-19.","Bozzo, C.

As some urologists may not be skilled with remote consultations, there is a need for recommendations on patient-centered online medical counseling. Material and methods: We have identified eight areas of excellence and defined the principles based on our experience. Results: A professional setting should be provided, in which the privacy of the patient can be ensured. Accompanying persons should be encouraged into the consultation. Proper introduction could serve not only to verify the personality of the patient, but also to provide them with a sense of confidentiality. The interview should be held in a way to overcome the limitations of non-physical encounters, and pande-mic-specific issues should be taken into consideration. When arranging plans, the physician should judge accordingly in regards to what type of management is inevitable or safe, as well as available at this point; strict follow-up should be arranged. As home isolation may lead to unfavorable changes in lifestyle, this issue should be addressed too. The patient should be guided on how to self-educate. Concluding the visit should be aimed at proper evaluation of the patient's comprehension of the consultation. Conclusions: It is vital to pursue consistency in providing care to patients. While online counseling may seem challenging, if one adheres to the principles of patient-centered practice, telemedicine may become a valuable tool in maintaining the best-quality care amid the ongoing pandemic.","Sosnowski, Roman; Kamecki, Hubert; Joniau, Steven; Walz, Jochen; Dowling, John; Behrendt, Mark; Klaassen, Zachary; Palou, Joan; van Poppel, Hendrik",Cent European J Urol,575,1

Decipher is a novel genomic classifier and almost all studies have confirmed Decipher as a reliable predictor of metastasis, recurrence and mortality. With the aid of Decipher, clinicians are able to determine the need for adjuvant versus salvage radiotherapy. Decipher has the potential to reduce decisional conflicts in clinical recommendations, and is cost-effective.

This study was carried out to determine the diagnostic accuracy of saliva for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in ambulatory children. METHODS: During 1 to 23 October 2020, we recruited a population-based sample of children presenting for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) screening in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. Each child provided paired nasopharyngeal (NP) swab and saliva for SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR N, E and RdRp gene detection. RESULTS: Paired NP swab and saliva samples were obtained from 476 children with mean ± standard deviation age of 10.8 ± 3.9 years, and 58.2% were male (277/476). Nine participants were sampled twice, so 485 pairs of NP swab/saliva were tested. Virus detection in at least one specimen type was reported in 17.9% (87/485), with similar detection in NP swab (16.7%, 81/485) and saliva (15.9%, 77/485). Sensitivity and specificity of saliva RT-PCR was 87.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 78.5-93.9) and 98.5% (95% CI 96.8-99.5). The positive and negative predictive values were 92.2% (95% CI 84.2-96.3) and 97.6% (95% CI 95.7-98.6), with a kappa coefficient of 0.879 (95% CI 0.821-0.937). Concordance of findings between NP swab and saliva did not differ by age (p 0.67) or gender (p 0.29). Cycle threshold (Ct) values were significantly higher in NP swab/saliva pairs with discordant findings compared to those with both specimens positive. CONCLUSIONS: In light of these findings, we recommend saliva as a diagnostic specimen for COVID-19 screening in children.","Al Suwaidi, Hanan; Senok, Abiola; Varghese, Rupa; Deesi, Zulfa; Khansaheb, Hamda; Pokasirakath, Sabeel; Chacko, Bino; Abufara, Ibrahim; Loney, Tom; Alsheikh-Ali, Alawi",Clin. microbiol. infect,575,21

To estimate the critical care bed capacity that would be required to admit all critical COVID-19 cases in a setting of unchecked SARS-CoV-2 transmission, both with and without elderly-specific protection measures.Methods. Using electronic health records of all 2432 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a large hospital in Madrid, Spain, between February 28 and April 23, 2020, we estimated the number of critical care beds needed to admit all critical care patients. To mimic a hypothetical intervention that halves SARS-CoV-2 infections among the elderly, we randomly excluded 50% of patients aged 65 years and older.Results. Critical care requirements peaked at 49 beds per 100 000 on April 1-2 weeks after the start of a national lockdown. After randomly excluding 50% of elderly patients, the estimated peak was 39 beds per 100 000.Conclusions. Under unchecked SARS-CoV-2 transmission, peak critical care requirements in Madrid were at least fivefold higher than prepandemic capacity. Under a hypothetical intervention that halves infections among the elderly, critical care peak requirements would have exceeded the prepandemic capacity of most high-income countries.Public Health Implications. Pandemic control strategies that rely exclusively on protecting the elderly are likely to overwhelm health care systems.","Martínez-Alés, Gonzalo; Domingo-Relloso, Arce; Arribas, José R; Quintana-Díaz, Manuel; Hernán, Miguel A",Am J Public Health,575,22

Early reports suggest that one downstream ramification is a change in trauma presentations. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect these public health measures had on major trauma admissions in the Northern Region, New Zealand. METHODS: A retrospective comparative cohort study was performed. Two cohorts were identified: 16 March to 8 June 2020 and the same period in 2019. Data was extracted from the New Zealand Major Trauma Registry which prospectively collects data on all major trauma in New Zealand. All patients who presented to a hospital in the Northern Region with major trauma and met the Registry inclusion criteria were included. RESULTS: There were 163 major trauma admissions in 2019 and 123 in 2020, a reduction of 25% (rate ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.6-0.95; P = 0.018). There was no significant difference in mechanism of injury (P = 0.442), type of injury (P = 0.062) or intent of injury (P = 0.971). There was a significant difference in place of injury (P = 0.004) with 20% of injuries happening at home in 2019 compared with 35% in 2020. CONCLUSION: This study has shown that public health interventions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 reduced major trauma admissions in the Northern Region of New Zealand. There was a variation in effect a between institutions within the region and a change in pattern of injury.","McGuinness, Matthew J; Harmston, Christopher",ANZ J Surg,575,16

We describe the psychological needs of HCPs during COVID-19 and the implementation of Project Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes (ECHO) Coping with COVID (ECHO-CWC) to help HCPs manage COVID-19 distress. METHODS: We used an established rapid implementation approach to accelerate the development and delivery of ECHO-CWC to address the emerging needs of HCPs. Participants' needs were identified using a 10-question survey of participants' perceived risk of COVID-19 and a five-item self-efficacy measure. Implementation outcomes consisted of participant engagement and session satisfaction scores using a five-point Likert scale. RESULTS: A total of 426 participants registered for ECHO-CWC. Needs assessment data (n = 129) showed that most participants reported feeling increased stress at work (84.5%), fear of infecting others (75.2%), and fear of falling ill (70.5%) from COVID-19, yet most participants accepted the risk associated with work during this time (59.7%). Participants were highly satisfied with the initial five sessions (mean = 4.26). DISCUSSION: HCPs reported the greatest concern with fears of infection and infecting others during the acute phase of the pandemic. Using an iterative curriculum design approach and existing implementation frameworks, the ECHO tele-education model can be rapidly mobilized to address HCPs' mental health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Sockalingam, Sanjeev; Clarkin, Chantalle; Serhal, Eva; Pereira, Cheryl; Crawford, Allison",J Contin Educ Health Prof,575,24

We track how the number of infected and critically ill people develops over time in order to estimate the demand that is imposed on the hospital system. To keep this demand under control, we consider a class of simple policies for slowing down and reopening the society and we compare their efficiency in mitigating the spread of the virus from several different points of view. We find that in order to avoid overwhelming of the hospital system, a policy must impose a harsh lockdown or it must react swiftly (or both). While reacting swiftly is universally beneficial, being harsh pays off only when the country is patient about reopening and when the neighboring countries coordinate their mitigation efforts. Our work highlights the importance of acting decisively when closing down and the importance of patience and coordination between neighboring countries when reopening.","Svoboda, Jakub; Tkadlec, Josef; Pavlogiannis, Andreas; Chatterjee, Krishnendu; Nowak, Martin A.",,575,22

Reports of sudden loss of taste and smell which persist even after recovery from COVID-19 infection are increasingly recognized as critical symptoms for COVID-19 infections. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional study on COVID-19 HCW (N = 104) who adhered to respond to a phone semistructured interview addressing the virus symptoms and associated psychological distress. Data were collected from June to September 2020. Findings confirm the association between experienced taste/olfactory loss and emotional distress and suggest that dysfunctions of taste and smell correlate positively with anxiety and depression. Furthermore, their psychological impact tends to persist even after the recovery from the disease, suggesting the need for appropriate psychological interventions to prevent people from developing more serious or long-lasting psychological disorders and, as far as HCW, to reduce the risk of work-related distress.","Dudine, Luisa; Canaletti, Claudia; Giudici, Fabiola; Lunardelli, Alberta; Abram, Giulia; Santini, Ingrid; Baroni, Vera; Paris, Marta; Pesavento, Valentina; Manganotti, Paolo; Ronchese, Federico; Gregoretti, Barbara; Negro, Corrado",Front Public Health,575,1

PURPOSE: Alvimopan is a peripherally acting opioid receptor antagonist indicated to accelerate gastrointestinal (GI) recovery following surgery, but its benefits past GI recovery are unknown and evidence suggests that it may increase risk for myocardial infarction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a pilot alvimopan stewardship program aimed at intervening to discontinue alvimopan use following GI recovery. METHODS: This was a retrospective, observational study examining the first 5 months of the alvimopan stewardship pilot program. During this initial period, a pharmacy resident assessed whether each patient met criteria for GI recovery, defined as solid food toleration and first bowel movement or flatus. If a patient met the criteria for GI recovery, the resident intervened and recommended that the primary team discontinue alvimopan. Primary outcomes were the percentage of patients with alvimopan continued past GI recovery and the percentage of patients for whom alvimopan ordered past GI recovery was discontinued following intervention by stewardship. Secondary outcomes included the percentage of accepted recommendations to discontinue alvimopan following GI recovery and the number of alvimopan doses ordered following GI recovery. RESULTS: In total, 73 patients were included in the study analysis, all of whom underwent abdominal and/or urologic surgery. Alvimopan was ordered to be administered in 35.6% (26/73) of patients after GI recovery. The stewardship program intervened and recommended discontinuation on 50% (13/26) of the alvimopan doses ordered past GI recovery. Recommendations were accepted by the primary team for 92.3% (12/13) of the patients. A total of 51 doses of alvimopan were ordered for administration past GI recovery, with an average of 2 doses per patient. CONCLUSION: A pilot pharmacy-driven alvimopan stewardship program was able to identify and intervene on alvimopan orders continued past GI recovery. Interventions decreasing alvimopan use past GI recovery could be of benefit by minimizing potential risk and decreasing potential costs without a negative impact on patient outcomes.","Shtoyko, Ashley N; Cwikla, Gregory M; Feldman, Elizabeth A; Darko, William; Miller, Christopher D; Seabury, Robert W",Am. j. health system pharm,575,16

In many countries, including Libya, institutions and organizations began to implement telehealth technology for the first time. This was to create an alternative modality for direct doctor-patient interviews to reduce the risk of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the usability of telehealth services in Libya and to provide an overview of the current COVID-19 situation. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between April 2020 and May 2020 among the Libyan population using an anonymous online survey. Participants were contacted by sending mobile messages, emails, and via social media. The survey included items that covered sociodemographic characteristics, the availability and accessibility of healthcare services, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care services, mental health assessment, and the feasibility and application of the telehealth system. RESULTS: We obtained 2512 valid responses; the majority (1721, 68.5%) were from females. The mean age (± standard deviation) was 28.2 ± 7.6 years; 92.9% were < 40 years-of-age and 58.2% were single. With regards to the assessment of healthcare services and accessibility, 31.1% reported that their health status was poor in general, and 19.6% reported having at least one chronic disease confirmed. In addition, 19.9% reported varying degrees of difficulty when accessing healthcare centers, and 62% were unable to access their medical records. Strikingly, 61.6% reported having problems covering medical costs, and 56.9% avoided seeking medical care due to financial concerns. With regards to the feasibility of the telehealth system, approximately 50% agreed on the usefulness of telehealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic, and 61.5% stated that the system was an effective means of communication and attaining healthcare services. The survey also showed that 57.1% felt comfortable while using the telehealth system and that 44.9% felt that they were able to express themselves effectively. Also, 55.3% found the system easy to understand, and 53.9% reported excellent communication with doctors using the telehealth system. However, only 40.5% reported that communication was better than the usual methods. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed that the Libyan population reported high levels of usability and willingness to use the telemedicine system as an alternative modality to in-person appointments. These systems is advantageous as it overcomes financial costs, increases access to timed medical care and follow-ups, and, most importantly, reduces the risk of COVID-19 transmission. However, internet connectivity and electricity issues could be a substantial barrier in many resource-limited communities, and further studies should address such obstacles in the future.","Elhadi, Muhammed; Msherghi, Ahmed; Elhadi, Ahmed; Ashini, Aimen; Alsoufi, Ahmed; Bin Alshiteewi, Fatimah; Elmabrouk, Amna; Alsuyihili, Ali; Elgherwi, Alsafa; Elkhfeefi, Fatima; Abdulrazik, Sarah; Tarek, Ahmed",,575,21

Although Australia and New Zealand have not been affected as much as some other countries, resuscitation may still pose a risk to health care workers and necessitates a change to our traditional approach. This consensus statement for adult cardiac arrest in the setting of COVID-19 has been produced by the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine (ACEM) and aligns with national and international recommendations. MAIN RECOMMENDATIONS: In a setting of low community transmission, most cardiac arrests are not due to COVID-19. Early defibrillation saves lives and is not considered an aerosol generating procedure. Compression-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation is thought to be a low risk procedure and can be safely initiated with the patient's mouth and nose covered. All other resuscitative procedures are considered aerosol generating and require the use of airborne personal protective equipment (PPE). It is important to balance the appropriateness of resuscitation against the risk of infection. Methods to reduce nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 include a physical barrier such as a towel or mask over the patient's mouth and nose, appropriate use of PPE, minimising the staff involved in resuscitation, and use of mechanical chest compression devices when available. If COVID-19 significantly affects hospital resource availability, the ethics of resource allocation must be considered. CHANGES IN MANAGEMENT: The changes outlined in this document require a significant adaptation for many doctors, nurses and paramedics. It is critically important that all health care workers have regular PPE and advanced life support training, are able to access in situ simulation sessions, and receive extensive debriefing after actual resuscitations. This will ensure safe, timely and effective management of the patients with cardiac arrest in the COVID-19 era.","Craig, Simon; Cubitt, Mya; Jaison, Ashish; Troupakis, Steven; Hood, Natalie; Fong, Christina; Bilgrami, Adnan; Leman, Peter; Ascencio-Lane, Juan Carlos; Nagaraj, Guruprasad; Bonning, John; Blecher, Gabriel; Mitchell, Rob; Burkett, Ellen; McCarthy, Sally M; Rojek, Amanda M; Hansen, Kim; Psihogios, Helen; Allely, Peter; Judkins, Simon; Foong, Lai Heng; Bernard, Stephen; Cameron, Peter A",Med J Aust,575,1

As hospitals work to acquire enough personal protective equipment and brace for potential cases, the role of infection prevention efforts and programs has become increasingly important. Lessons from the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak in Toronto and 2015 MERS-CoV outbreak in South Korea have unveiled the critical role that hospitals play in outbreaks, especially of novel coronaviruses. Their ability to amplify the spread of disease can rapidly fuel transmission of the disease and often those failures in infection prevention and general hospital practices contribute to such events. While efforts to enhance infection prevention measures and hospital readiness are underway in the United States, it is important to understand why these programs were not able to maintain continued, sustainable levels of readiness. History has shown that infection prevention programs are primarily responsible for preparing hospitals and responding to biological events but face under-staffing and focused efforts defined by administrators. The current U.S. healthcare system though, is built upon a series of priorities that often view biopreparedness as a costly endeavor. Awareness of these competing priorities and the challenges infection prevention programs face when working to maintain biopreparedness is critical in adequately addressing this critical infrastructure in the face of an international outbreak.","Popescu, Saskia",Disaster Med Public Health Prep,575,1

Genomic studies have confirmed the role of the viral spike protein in virulence and pathogenicity. They target the respiratory tract of the human causing severe progressive pneumonia affecting other organs like central nervous system in case of SARS-CoV, severe renal failure in MERS-CoV, and multi-organ failure in SARS-CoV-2. Herein, with respect to current awareness and role of coronaviruses in global public health, we review the various factors involving the origin, evolution, and transmission including the genetic variations observed, epidemiology, and pathogenicity of the three potential coronaviruses variants SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and 2019-nCoV.","Krishnamoorthy, Sarayu; Swain, Basudev; Verma, R S; Gunthe, Sachin S",Virusdisease,575,20

Studies suggest that mortality due to COVID 19 is mainly attributed to the hyper inflammatory response leading to cytokine storm and ARDS in infected patients. Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1) analogs, AAL-R and RP-002, have earlier provided in-vivo protection from the pathophysiological response during H1N1 influenza infection and improved mortality. Recently, it was shown that the treatment with sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 analog, CYM5442, resulted in the significant dampening of the immune response upon H1N1 challenge in mice and improved survival of H1N1 infected mice in combination with an antiviral drug, oseltamivir. Hence, here we suggest to investigate the possible utility of using S1P analogs to treat COVID-19.","Naz, Farha; Arish, Mohd",Front Immunol,575,10

We conducted an investigation to identify secondary cases and interrupt transmission. METHODS: We defined as a confirmed case a person linked to the chalet with a positive reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction sample for SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The index case stayed 4 days in the chalet with 10 English tourists and a family of 5 French residents; SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 5 individuals in France, 6 in England (including the index case), and 1 in Spain (overall attack rate in the chalet: 75%). One pediatric case, with picornavirus and influenza A coinfection, visited 3 different schools while symptomatic. One case was asymptomatic, with similar viral load as that of a symptomatic case. Seven days after the first cases were diagnosed, 1 tertiary case was detected in a symptomatic patient with from the chalet a positive endotracheal aspirate; all previous and concurrent nasopharyngeal specimens were negative. Additionally, 172 contacts were monitored; all contacts tested for SARS-CoV-2 (N = 73) were negative. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence in this cluster of 1 asymptomatic case with similar viral load as a symptomatic patient suggests transmission potential of asymptomatic individuals. The fact that an infected child did not transmit the disease despite close interactions within schools suggests potential different transmission dynamics in children. Finally, the dissociation between upper and lower respiratory tract results underscores the need for close monitoring of the clinical evolution of suspected cases of coronavirus disease 2019.","Danis, Kostas; Epaulard, Olivier; Bénet, Thomas; Gaymard, Alexandre; Campoy, Séphora; Botelho-Nevers, Elisabeth; Bouscambert-Duchamp, Maude; Spaccaferri, Guillaume; Ader, Florence; Mailles, Alexandra; Boudalaa, Zoubida; Tolsma, Violaine; Berra, Julien; Vaux, Sophie; Forestier, Emmanuel; Landelle, Caroline; Fougere, Erica; Thabuis, Alexandra; Berthelot, Philippe; Veil, Raphael; Levy-Bruhl, Daniel; Chidiac, Christian; Lina, Bruno; Coignard, Bruno; Saura, Christine",Clin Infect Dis,575,20

With one of the highest excess death rates globally, Ecuador had a comparatively low number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, which may have been influenced by limited availability of data for decision-making due to low laboratory capacity. METHODS: We examine de-identified data on 55,063 individuals with suspected COVID-19 between February 27 and April 30, 2020 included in the RT-PCR testing database collected by the Ministry of Health. Processing times and rates per province, and the number of pending tests, were tallied cumulatively. We assessed the relationship between sample shipping, laboratory capacity and case completion using a negative binomial generalized linear model. RESULTS: The national average time for case completion was 3 days; 12.1% of samples took &#8805;10 days to complete; the national average daily backlog was 29.1 tests per 100,000 people. Only 8 out of 24 provinces had authorized COVID-19 processing laboratories but not all processed samples. There was an association between samples coming from outside the processing laboratory province, the number of other samples present at the laboratory during processing, and the amount of time needed to process a sample. Samples from another province took 1.29 times as long to process, on average. The percentage of pending results on April 30 was 67.1%. CONCLUSION: A centralized RT-PCR testing system contributes to critical delays in processing, which may mask a case burden higher than reported, impeding timely awareness, and adequate clinical care and vaccination strategies and subsequent monitoring. Although Ecuador adapted or authorized existing facilities to address limitations in laboratory capacity for COVID-19, this study highlights the need to estimate and augment laboratory capabilities for improved decision making and policies on diagnostic guidelines and availability. Support is needed to procure the necessary human and physical resources at all phases of diagnostic testing, including transportation of samples and supplies, and information management.

Since the end of 2018, a remarkably increasing number of commercial broilers and layers, vaccinated or not, were infected with IBV in China. Here, we described two IB outbreaks with severe respiratory system or kidney injury in IBV-vaccinated commercial poultry farms in central China. Other possible causative viral pathogens, including avian influenza virus (AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and Kedah fatal kidney syndrome virus (KFKSV), were excluded by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and three virulent IBV strains, HeN-1/China/2019, HeN-2/China/2019 and HeN-101/China/2019, were identified. Although the gross pathologic appearance of these two IB outbreaks was different, the newly identified IBV strains were all closely related to the ck/China/I0529/17 strain and grouped into GI-19 genotype clade based on the sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of the complete S1 genes. Moreover, there are still some evolutionary distance between the newly identified IBV strains, HeN-101/China/2019 in particular, and other GI-19 strains, suggesting that Chinese IBV strains constantly emerge and evolve towards different directions. In conclusion, this study provided an insight of the recently emerging IBV outbreaks in IBV-vaccinated commercial poultry farms and identified the genetic characteristics of three virulent GI-19 IBV strains, which shows the need to carry out proper preventive measures and control strategies.","Zhang, Xiaozhan; Deng, Tongwei; Lu, Jianzhou; Zhao, Pandeng; Chen, Lulu; Qian, Mengwei; Guo, Yiwen; Qiao, Hongxing; Xu, Yaohui; Wang, Yan; Li, Xinzheng; Zhang, Guizhi; Wang, Zeng; Bian, Chuanzhou",Transbound Emerg Dis,575,3

COVID-19 is associated with the different comorbidities with its change in biological function such as causing heart dysfunction via deregulating ACE-2 receptor, gastrointestinal risk via causing vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, chronic kidney disease via proteinuria and hematuria, diabetes mellitus, liver injury via increasing ALT, AST and bilirubin level, lung injury, CNS risk, ocular risk, and cancer risk. In this, we are focused on the COVID-19 connected with male infertility. Some of the studies show that the patients of COVID-19 are associated with impaired spermatogenesis. Impaired spermatogenesis via COVID-19 decreases the level of testosterone by disturbing cytokines such as TNF-&#945;, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-12 and further, attenuates the sperm count. COVID-19 is causing inflammation via TNF-&#945; and interferons. IL-4 plays an eminent role in the activation of the JAK-STAT pathway and leads to the disturbing pro-inflammatory cytokine as well as further cause's male infertility. Th2 activates the IL-4 through IgG and IgE and mediates apoptosis with the triggering of STAT signaling. The activated STAT signaling augments Batf/Irf4, and the Bach2/Batf pathway. On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 is activating the level of Th2 cells. So, we hypothesized that the augmented Th2 cells would disturb the level of IL-4, JAK-STAT signaling, Batf/Irf4, and Bach2/Batf pathway. The disturbed IL-4 decreases the level of the ACE-2 with the inflammation. This further leads to male infertility in COVID-19 patients. So, in this hypothesis, we focused on the role of IL-4 in COVID-19 patients associated with male infertility via Th2 cells and JAK-STAT signaling.","Renu, Kaviyarasi; Subramaniam, Mohana Devi; Chakraborty, Rituraj; Myakala, Haritha; Iyer, Mahalaxmi; Bharathi, Geetha; Siva, Kamalakannan; Vellingiri, Balachandar; Valsala Gopalakrishnan, Abilash",J Reprod Immunol,575,33

Methods: All SARS-CoV-2 antibody-positive persons from April 16 to December 31, 2020 with a PCR-positive swab &gt;=14 days after the first-positive antibody test were investigated for evidence of reinfection. Viral genome sequencing was conducted for paired viral specimens to confirm reinfection. Incidence of reinfection was compared to incidence of infection in the complement cohort of those who were antibody-negative. Findings: Among 43,044 antibody-positive persons who were followed for a median of 16.3 weeks (range: 0-34.6), 314 individuals (0.7%) had at least one PCR positive swab &gt;=14 days after the first-positive antibody test. Of these individuals, 129 (41.1%) had supporting epidemiological evidence for reinfection. Reinfection was next investigated using viral genome sequencing. Applying the viral-genome-sequencing confirmation rate, the incidence rate of reinfection was estimated at 0.66 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 0.56-0.78). Incidence rate of reinfection versus month of follow-up did not show any evidence of waning of immunity for over seven months of follow-up. Meanwhile, in the complement cohort of 149,923 antibody-negative persons followed for a median of 17.0 weeks (range: 0-45.6), incidence rate of infection was estimated at 13.69 per 10,000 person-weeks (95% CI: 13.22-14.14). Efficacy of natural infection against reinfection was estimated at 95.2% (95% CI: 94.1-96.0%). Reinfections were less severe than primary infections. Only one reinfection was severe, two were moderate, and none were critical or fatal. Most reinfections (66.7%) were diagnosed incidentally through random or routine testing, or through contact tracing. Interpretation: Reinfection is rare in the young and international population of Qatar.

Our algorithm, ALBU (approximate LBU), has strong similarities with Variational Message Passing (VMP) (which is the message passing variant of VB). To compare the performance of the algorithms in the presence of limited data, we use data sets consisting of tweets and news groups. Additionally, to perform more fine grained evaluations and comparisons, we use simulations that enable comparisons with the ground truth via Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD). Using coherence measures for the text corpora and KLD with the simulations we show that ALBU learns latent distributions more accurately than does VB, especially for smaller data sets.","Taylor, Rebecca M.C.; Preez, Johan A. du",,575,13

This article uses the example of the public health services in Sweden, France and Austria to address the question of the similarities and differences in the measures taken to combat the pandemic (status: November 2020).Among the countries presented in this article, Austria is the least affected by the pandemic and France is the most affected. In all analysed health systems there is a tension between national and regional responsibilities. France's healthcare system is particularly centralized, while Sweden's is strongly regional and municipal. Governments in the nation states are striving to obtain pandemic containment powers independent of parliamentary decisions. Sweden differs from Austria and France in that its pandemic containment strategy is based primarily on recommendations and appeals rather than directives and bans. The sequences of action during the pandemic and, apart from Sweden, the instruments used to contain the pandemic are similar. The course of the pandemic and the measures taken in Austria and France show clear parallels with those in Germany. The protection of particularly vulnerable groups has not been sufficiently successful in all countries and remains a challenge to be met.","Gerlinger, Thomas; Schmidt, Phillip Florian; Lückenbach, Caspar",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,575,1

Hence, we aim to use the combination of symptoms to build a predictive model as a screening tool to identify people and areas with a higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection to be prioritized for testing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective analysis of individuals registered in ""Dados do Bem,"" a Brazilian app-based symptom tracker. We applied machine learning techniques and provided a SARS-CoV-2 infection risk map of Rio de Janeiro city. RESULTS: From April 28 to July 16, 2020, 337,435 individuals registered their symptoms through the app. Of these, 49,721 participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection, being 5,888 (11.8%) positive. Among self-reported symptoms, loss of smell (OR[95%CI]: 4.6 [4.4-4.9]), fever (2.6 [2.5-2.8]), and shortness of breath (2.1 [1.6-2.7]) were independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our final model obtained a competitive performance, with only 7% of false-negative users predicted as negatives (NPV = 0.93). The model was incorporated by the ""Dados do Bem"" app aiming to prioritize users for testing. We developed an external validation in the city of Rio de Janeiro. We found that the proportion of positive results increased significantly from 14.9% (before using our model) to 18.1% (after the model). CONCLUSIONS: Our results showed that the combination of symptoms might predict SARS-Cov-2 infection and, therefore, can be used as a tool by decision-makers to refine testing and disease control strategies.","Dantas, Leila F; Peres, Igor T; Bastos, Leonardo S L; Marchesi, Janaina F; de Souza, Guilherme F G; Gelli, João Gabriel M; Baião, Fernanda A; Maçaira, Paula; Hamacher, Silvio; Bozza, Fernando A",PLoS One,575,24

We sought to investigate the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on cardiac injury and hypertension during the current coronavirus pandemic. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The clinical data of 366 hospitalized COVID-19-confirmed patients were analyzed. The clinical signs and laboratory findings were extracted from electronic medical records. Two independent, experienced clinicians reviewed and analyzed the data. RESULTS: Cardiac injury was found in 11.19% (30/268) of enrolled patients. 93.33% (28/30) of cardiac injury cases were in the severe group. The laboratory findings indicated that white blood cells, neutrophils, procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, lactate, and lactic dehydrogenase were positively associated with cardiac injury marker. Compared with healthy controls, the 190 patients without prior hypertension have higher Angâ ¡ level, of which 16 (8.42%) patients had a rise in blood pressure to the diagnostic criteria of hypertension during hospitalization, with a significantly increased level of the cTnI, procalcitonin, angiotensin-II (Angâ ¡) than those normal blood pressure ones. Multivariate analysis indicated that elevated age, cTnI, the history of hypertension, and diabetes were independent predictors for illness severity. The predictive model, based on the four parameters and gender, has a good ability to identify the clinical severity of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients (area under the curve: 0.932, sensitivity: 98.67%, specificity: 75.68%). CONCLUSION: Hypertension, sometimes accompanied by elevated cTnI, may occur in COVID-19 patients and become a sequela. Enhancing Ang II signaling, driven by SARS-CoV-2 infection, might play an important role in the renin-angiotensin system, and consequently lead to the development of hypertension in COVID-19.","Chen, Ganxiao; Li, Xun; Gong, Zuojiong; Xia, Hao; Wang, Yao; Wang, Xuefen; Huang, Yan; Barajas-Martinez, Hector; Hu, Dan",PLoS One,575,16

This has increased the workload on radiologists, and a number of cases are in backlog. This is not only the case for COVID-19, but for the other abnormalities needing radiological diagnosis as well. In this work, we present an automated technique for rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 on computed tomography images. The proposed technique consists of four primary steps: (1) data collection and normalization, (2) extraction of the relevant features, (3) selection of the most optimal features and (4) feature classification. In the data collection step, we collect data for several patients from a public domain website, and perform preprocessing, which includes image resizing. In the successive step, we apply discrete wavelet transform and extended segmentation-based fractal texture analysis methods for extracting the relevant features. This is followed by application of an entropy controlled genetic algorithm for selection of the best features from each feature type, which are combined using a serial approach. In the final phase, the best features are subjected to various classifiers for the diagnosis. The proposed framework, when augmented with the Naive Bayes classifier, yields the best accuracy of 92.6%. The simulation results are supported by a detailed statistical analysis as a proof of concept.","Akram, Tallha; Attique, Muhammad; Gul, Salma; Shahzad, Aamir; Altaf, Muhammad; Naqvi, S Syed Rameez; Damasevicius, Robertas; Maskeliunas, Rytis",Pattern Anal Appl,575,25

However, aggregated case report data suffers from reporting delays and can lead to misleading inferences. Different from aggregated case report data, line list data is a table contains individual features such as dates of symptom onset and reporting for each reported case and a good source for modeling delays. Current methods for modeling reporting delays are not particularly appropriate for line list data, which typically has missing symptom onset dates that are non-ignorable for modeling reporting delays. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian approach that dynamically integrates imputation and estimation for line list data. Specifically, this Bayesian approach can accurately estimate the epidemic curve and instantaneous reproduction numbers, even with most symptom onset dates missing. The Bayesian approach is also robust to deviations from model assumptions, such as changes in the reporting delay distribution or incorrect specification of the maximum reporting delay. We apply the Bayesian approach to COVID-19 line list data in Massachusetts and find the reproduction number estimates correspond more closely to the control measures than the estimates based on the reported curve.","Li, Tenglong; White, Laura F.",PLoS Comput Biol,575,10

The assay demonstrated good inter- and intra- assay precision, accuracy, as well as excellent linearity across a range of over 6 orders of magnitude for target gene quantification. In addition, comparison of the assay on both dPCR and qPCR platforms revealed that dPCR exhibited a slightly higher sensitivity compared to its qPCR counterpart when quantifying SARS-CoV-2 at a lower concentration. Overall, the results showed that the dPCR assay is a reliable and effective approach for the absolute quantification of SARS-CoV-2 and can potentially be adopted as a molecular tool in applications such as detecting low viral loads in patients as well as in wastewater surveillance of COVID-19.","Tan, S.

Our study indicates that failure to segregate vertical and horizontal IIT from the total IIT possibly leads to potential bias in econometric results. Drawing on annual multilateral trade data encompassing two and half decades of the liberalization period, we find India’s IIT outpaced the growth of inter-industry trade over the years and its contribution mainly came from six manufacturing industry groups whose export baskets had been loaded with low vertically differentiated goods. However, horizontal and high vertical IIT have gained some momentum since the end of the last decade. Given the fractional nature of our dependent variable, we initially estimate a (random effects) Tobit model followed by the Exponential Regression of Fractional Response model. The robust econometric findings show that product differentiation has a positive impact only on total IIT. Whereas vertical and horizontal IIT are promoted in industries with concentrated and competitive market structures, respectively. The prevalence of concentrated market structure indicates that (large) Indian firms sustain import competition by specializing in low vertically differentiated goods, as they efficiently adjust to resource reallocation.","Bagchi, Sagnik; Bhattacharyya, Surajit",Indian Econ Rev,575,20

Despite this, patients with respiratory tract infections often receive antibiotics, fuelling the rise of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, there is a need to encourage patients to try alternative non-antibiotic therapies, which ideally treat the symptoms and the cause. Lozenges containing amylmetacresol and 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol (AMC/DCBA lozenges) as well as lozenges containing hexylresorcinol have been shown to provide effective symptomatic relief for sore throat. In this study, we investigated whether these lozenges also have virucidal effects in vitro against two viruses associated with respiratory tract infections, parainfluenza virus type 3 and cytomegalovirus. Both viruses were incubated with AMC/DCBA lozenge, placebo lozenge or the active ingredients (AMC/DCBA) as free substances, and parainfluenza virus type 3 was incubated with hexylresorcinol lozenge, placebo lozenge or hexylresorcinol as a free substance. Virucidal effects were observed with the active lozenges and the active ingredients as free substances against both parainfluenza virus type 3 and cytomegalovirus. Mean reductions in viral titre were significantly greater compared with placebo lozenge and peak effects were observed for the shortest incubation time, 1 min. These findings suggest that AMC/DCBA lozenge and hexylresorcinol lozenge have the potential to have local antiviral effects in patients with sore throat due to viral respiratory tract infections. Use of such over-the-counter treatments for self-limiting respiratory tract infections may satisfy patients’ desire for an anti-infective medication and reduce the demand for antibiotics.","Shephard, Adrian; Zybeshari, Stela",Antiviral Res,575,11

Panel data from 2007 to 2013 for 138 routes with HSR-air competition were used to identify the ex-post impacts of the entry of HSR services, the duration of operating HSR services since entry, and the specific impacts of HSR transportation variables such as travel time, frequency, and ticket fares on air passenger flows in China. The findings show that the entry of new HSR services in general leads to a 27% reduction in air travel demand. After two years of operating HSR services, however, the negative impact of HSR services on air passenger flows tends to further increase. The variations of the frequency in the temporal dimension and the travel time in the spatial dimension significantly affect air passenger flows. Neither in the temporal nor spatial dimensions are HSR fares strongly related to air passenger flows in China, due to the government regulation of HSR ticket prices during the period of analysis. The impacts of different transportation variables found in this paper are valuable to consider by operational HSR companies in terms of scheduling and planning of new routes to increase their competitiveness relative to airlines.","Yang, Haoran; Burghouwt, Guillaume; Wang, Jiaoe; Boonekamp, Thijs; Dijst, Martin",Appl Geogr,575,16

The basic reproduction number with important biological significance is calculated, and the stability of equilibria is proved. Through the optimal control theory, the expression of optimal control pairs is obtained. In the following numerical simulation, the optimal control under 11 control strategies are simulated. Through the data analysis of incremental cost-effectiveness ratio and infection averted ratio of all control strategies, if we consider the control problem from different perspectives, we will get different optimal control strategies.

Objective: To evaluate the impact of different COVID-19 vaccines on specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG levels in human milk. Design, Settings and Participants: In this prospective observational study in Spain, 75 lactating women from priority groups receiving vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 were included (January to April 2021). Human milk samples were collected at seven-time points. A group with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (n=19) and a group of women from prepandemic time (n=13) were included. Exposure: mRNA vaccines (BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273) and adenovirus-vectored vaccine (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19). Main Outcome(s) and Measure(s): Presence of IgA and IgG against RBD SARS-CoV-2 in breast milk. Results: Seventy-five vaccinated lactating women [mean age, 34.9{+/-}3.7 years] of whom 96% were Caucasic and 92% were health care workers. A total of 417 milk samples were included and vaccine distribution was BioNTech/Pfizer (BNT162b2, n=30), Moderna (mRNA-1273, n=21), and AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, n=24). For each vaccine, 7 time points were collected from baseline up to 25 days after the 1st dose and same points were collected for mRNA vaccines 30 days after 2nd dose. A strong reactivity was observed for IgG and IgA after vaccination mainly after the 2nd dose. Presence and the persistence of specific SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in breast milk were dependent on the vaccine-type and, on previous virus exposure. High inter-variability was observed, being relevant for IgA antibodies. IgG levels were significantly higher than those observed in milk from COVID-19 women while IgA levels were lower. Women with previous COVID-19 increased the IgG levels after the 1st dose to a similar level observed in vaccinated women after the 2nd dose. Conclusions and Relevance: Breast milk from vaccinated women contains anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgA and IgG, with highest after the 2nd dose. Levels were dependent on vaccine type and previous exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Previous COVID-19 influenced the vaccine effect after a single dose, which could be especially relevant in the design of vaccination protocols .

Patients with cancer are found to have poorer outcome and higher death rate, especially those with active hematologic malignancies. Transfusion for cancer or treatment-related anemia is an essential part in the management of hematologic patients. Objective: The main objective was to assess, based on an extended review of the literature, the safety of transfusion during the COVID-19 pandemic, for patients, staff, and donors. Viremia and Potential for Transfusion-Transmission: There have been no reported or suspected cases of transfusion-transmitted COVID-19. Respiratory viruses, like influenza, MERS and SARS, are not known to be transmitted via transfusion. For SARS-CoV-2 infection, RNA was detected in blood in 15-20% of symptomatic patients in two studies conducted in China. Viremia was never reported in any asymptomatic patient. Another study in Korea, identified seven donors as COVID-19 confirmed cases after blood donation. None of the recipients have developed any symptoms related to COVID-19. Repository samples from the donors were tested and SARS-CoV-2 RNA was not detected in any of them. Given this information, coupled with the fact that symptomatic patients should not donate blood, the risk of transfusion-transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains theoretical. The Risk of Staff and Donor Exposure to COVID-19: The risk is proportional to safety measures implemented by the centers. Precautions should be taken including: questionnaire to screen donors by phone before coming to donation; social distancing; donation by appointment; frequent cleaning for all surfaces and equipment. Recommendations for Hematology Patients: Patients with hematological malignancies must receive state-of-the-art treatment. Think about possible schedules to reduce hospital visits and treatment toxicities. Consider prophylactic erythropoietin stimulating agents if they are judged safe. Give transfusion only for serious (<7 g/dL) or symptomatic anemia. Implement a well-defined strategy for environmental control.

Applying network analytics, this study investigates the contribution of individual disciplines in the successfully funded projects. It is noted that the disciplines Engineering, Biological Sciences and Technology appear as the principal disciplines in interdisciplinary research having a STEM focus. By contrast, non-STEM interdisciplinary research is led by three disciplines—Studies in Human Societies, Language, Communication and Culture, and History and Archaeology. For projects entailing interdisciplinarity between STEM and non-STEM disciplines, the STEM discipline of Medical and Health Sciences and the non-STEM disciplines of Psychology and Cognitive Science and Studies in Human Societies appear as the leading contributors. Overall, the network-based visualisation reveals that research interdisciplinarity is implemented in a heterogeneous way across STEM and non-STEM disciplines, and there are gaps in inter-disciplinary collaborations among some disciplines.","Uddin, Shahadat; Imam, Tasadduq; Mozumdar, Mohammad",Scientometrics,575,11

We aimed to assess the relationship between severity of inflammatory response/coagulation abnormalities and hsTnT in Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). We then explored the relevance of these pathways in defining mortality and complications risk and the potential effects of the treatments to attenuate such risk. In this single-center, prospective, observational study we enrolled 266 consecutive patients hospitalized for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Primary endpoint was in-hospital COVID-19 mortality. hsTnT, even after adjustment for confounders, was associated with mortality. D-dimer and CRP presented stronger associations with hsTnT than PaO(2). Changes of hsTnT, D-dimer and CRP were related; but only D-dimer was associated with mortality. Moreover, low molecular weight heparin showed attenuation of the mortality in the whole population, particularly in subjects with higher hsTnT. D-dimer possessed a strong relationship with hsTnT and mortality. Anticoagulation treatment showed greater benefits with regard to mortality.

From January to April 2013, 28 African countries were invited to participate in a review of severe acute respiratory illness (SARI)–associated deaths identified from influenza surveillance during 2009–2012. Results. Twenty-three countries (82%) responded, 11 (48%) collect mortality data, and 8 provided data. Data were collected from 37 714 SARI cases, and 3091 (8.2%; range by country, 5.1%–25.9%) tested positive for influenza virus. There were 1073 deaths (2.8%; range by country, 0.1%–5.3%) reported, among which influenza virus was detected in 57 (5.3%). Case-fatality proportion (CFP) was higher among countries with systematic death reporting than among those with sporadic reporting. The influenza-associated CFP was 1.8% (57 of 3091), compared with 2.9% (1016 of 34 623) for influenza virus–negative cases (P < .001). Among 834 deaths (77.7%) tested for other respiratory pathogens, rhinovirus (107 [12.8%]), adenovirus (64 [6.0%]), respiratory syncytial virus (60 [5.6%]), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (57 [5.3%]) were most commonly identified. Among 1073 deaths, 402 (37.5%) involved people aged 0–4 years, 462 (43.1%) involved people aged 5–49 years, and 209 (19.5%) involved people aged ≥50 years. Conclusions.

However, the majority of currently available data are restricted to laboratory-confirmed cases for symptomatic patients, and the SARS-CoV-2 infection can manifest as an asymptomatic or mild disease; therefore, the true extent of the burden of COVID-19 can be underestimated. Improved serological detection of specific antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 can help estimate the true number of infections. This article comprehensively reviewed the associated literature and provides updated information regarding the seroprevalence of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody. The seroprevalence can vary according to different sites and the seroprevalence can increase with time in the longitudinal follow-up. Although healthcare workers (HCWs), especially those caring for COVID-19 patients, are considered as a high-risk group, the seroprevalence of a HCW wearing adequate personal protective equipment is thought to not be higher than other groups. With regard to sex, no statistical difference has been found between male and female subjects. Some, but not all, studies have shown that children have a lower risk than other age groups. Finally, seroprevalence can vary according to different populations, such as pregnant women and hemodialysis patients; however, limited studies have examined these associations. Furthermore, continued seroprevalence surveillance is warranted to estimate and monitor the growing burden of COVID-19.","Lai, Chih-Cheng; Wang, Jui-Hsiang; Hsueh, Po-Ren",Int J Infect Dis,575,16

BACKGROUND: Acute myocardial damage is common in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19, with evidence of myocardial infarction and myocarditis demonstrated on cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Post-mortem studies have also implicated microvascular thrombosis, which may cause persistent microvascular disease. PURPOSE: To determine the long-term coronary sequelae in recovered COVID-19 using multiparametric CMR including state-of-the-art inline quantitative stress myocardial blood flow (sMBF) mapping to assess global and regional sMBF. METHODS: Prospective, multicentre observational study of recovered COVID-19 patients scanned at three London CMR units. Results were compared to a propensity-matched, pre-COVID chest pain cohort (104 patients referred for perfusion CMR, with subsequently demonstrated unobstructed coronary arteries) and 27 healthy volunteers (HV). Perfusion image analysis was performed using a novel artificial intelligence approach deriving global and regional stress and rest MBF with a cut-off of >2.25mL/g/min signifying normal sMBF and <1.82mL/g/min abnormal sMBF (Kotecha JCVI 2019). RESULTS: 104 recovered, post-COVID patients (median age 62 years, 76% male; 89[87%] hospitalised, 41/89[46%] requiring ICU) underwent adenosine-stress perfusion CMR at a median 131(IQR 43-179) days from COVID-19 diagnosis. Median LVEF was 67% (IQR 60-71%; 12 (11.5%) with impaired LVEF), 51 patients (49%) had late gadolinium enhancement (LGE); 18% infarct-pattern and 33% non-ischaemic LGE. Global stress MBF in post-COVID patients was no different to age-, sex- and co-morbidities-matched controls (2.57 ± 0.77 vs. 2.40 ± 0.75 ml/g/min, p = 0.11, Figure 1), though lower than HV (3.00 ± 0.76 ml/g/min, p = 0.001). Post-COVID, multivariate predictors of low sMBF were male sex (OR 0.57, 95%CI 0.41-0.80, p = 0.001) and hypertension (OR 0.67, 95%CI 0.51-0.88, p = 0.004), but not COVID-19 disease severity (ICU admission) or presence of scar (ischemic/non-ischemic). 21/42 with reduced sMBF (<2.25mL/g/min) had regional perfusion defects consistent with epicardial coronary disease. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 survivors do not demonstrate evidence of reduced global MBF by CMR compared to risk factor matched controls. Stress perfusion CMR identifies etiology of acute myocardial damage (infarction/myocarditis) and presence of occult coronary ischemia.","Thornton, G; Shetye, A; Knott, K; Razvi, Y; Vimalesvaran, K; Kurdi, H; Artico, J; Yousef, S; Antonakaki, D; Kellman, P; Knight, D; Cole, GD; Moon, JC; Fontana, M; Treibel, TA",Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging,575,20

However, Brucella infection can cause serum prostate-specific antigen levels to become abnormally elevated. When concurrent with lumbar vertebra infection and erosion, brucellosis can easily be misdiagnosed as prostate cancer with bone metastasis. CASE SUMMARY: A 45-year-old man complained of recurrent low back pain and fever for 2 wk. Magnetic resonance imaging of the lumbar vertebrae showed abnormal signs at the rear of the L4–5 vertebral body. Serum prostate-specific antigen level was 17.64 ng/mL, and positron emission tomography/computed tomography suggested the possibility of prostate cancer with liver and lumbar metastases. The patient was transferred to our department for further treatment. He experienced repeated bouts of fever and low back pain during hospitalization. Biopsy results indicated prostatitis. There was no significant increase in white blood cell count or procalcitonin levels. The Mycobacterium tuberculosis smear and antibody detection results were negative. Cefoperazone sulbactam was not effective. Blood culture test results were positive for brucellosis, confirming the diagnosis of brucellosis. After oral anti-infection treatment with doxycycline and rifampicin, the body temperature gradually returned to normal, and lumbago improved. After continuous treatment for 6 mo, the patient recovered. CONCLUSION: In patients with low back pain and fever accompanied by elevated prostate-specific antigen levels and lesions of the prostate and lumbar spine, a detailed medical history and blood and urine cultures should be obtained, and attention should be given to the local epidemic infectious disease situation.","Yan, Jun-Feng; Zhou, Hai-Yong; Luo, Sheng-Fu; Wang, Xing; Yu, Jian-Di",World J Clin Cases,575,33

Previous reports demonstrate the existence of endotoxemia in viral infections without superimposed gram-negative bacteremia, but the rate and severity of endotoxemia in critically ill patients with COVID-19 requires further exploration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a single-center cross-sectional study of 92 intensive care unit patients diagnosed with COVID-19 pneumonia. Endotoxin activity (EA) was measured in patients that met the following criteria: (1) age ≥18 years and (2) multi-organ dysfunction score >9 from March 24, 2020, to June 20, 2020. RESULTS: A total of 32 patients met the inclusion/exclusion criteria for measurement of EA. The median age of the study cohort was 60 years with a majority male (21/32, 65%) with hypertension (50%). A significant proportion of the patients exhibited either elevated EA in the intermediate range (0.40–0.59 EA units) (10/32, 31%) or high range (≥0.60 EA units) (14/32, 44%) or were nonresponders (NRs, low neutrophil response) to EA (6/32, 19%), with the presence of gram-negative bacteremia only in 2/32 (6%) patients. Low EA was reported in 2/32 patients. NRs (5/6, 83%) and patients with high EA (7/14, 50%) exhibited higher acute kidney injury (AKI) as compared to patients with low/intermediate EA level (1/12, 8.3%). DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Elevated EA was observed in a large majority of critically ill patients with COVID-19 and multi-organ dysfunction despite a low incidence of concurrent gram-negative bacteremia. While we observed that elevated EA and nonresponsiveness to EA were associated with AKI in critically ill patients with COVID-19, these findings require further validation in larger longitudinal cohorts.","Khan, Sobia; Bolotova, Olena; Sahib, Haseena; Foster, Debra; Mallipattu, Sandeep K.",Blood Purif,575,1

From this model, we derive an expression for the probability of a widespread outbreak and a condition to ensure that the epidemic is controlled. Moreover, multiple simulations are used to make predictions of the likelihood of various eventual scenarios for fixed initial conditions. The main conclusions of this study are: (i) “super-spreaders” may occur even if the infectiousness of all infected individuals is constant; (ii) consistent with previous reports, extended exposure time beyond 3–5 days (i.e. significant nosocomial transmission) was the key factor in the severity of the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong; and, (iii) the spread of SARS can be effectively controlled by either limiting long range links (imposing a partial quarantine) or enforcing rapid hospitalisation and isolation of symptomatic individuals.","Small, Michael; Tse, C.K.; Walker, David M.",Physica D,575,9

However, given the accelerating demographic, environmental, economical, socio-political, and technological changes—and their associated risks and opportunities—there is increasing consensus that our current educational systems are falling short and that we need to repurpose education and rethink the organization of learning to meet the challenges of the 21st century. The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) “Futures of Education” initiative was formally launched at the United Nations General Assembly in 2019 to provide such a vision of education for the future. The International Scientific and Evidence-based Education (ISEE) Assessment synthesizes knowledge streams generated by different communities and stakeholders at all levels and scales and will thereby essentially contribute to re-envisioning this future of education. The overall aim of the ISEE Assessment is to pool the expertise from a broad range of knowledge holders and stakeholders to undertake a scientifically robust and evidence-based assessment in an open and inclusive manner of our current educational systems and its necessary reforms. In this commentary, we discuss the aims and goals of the ISEE Assessment. We describe how the ISEE Assessment will address key questions on the purpose of education and what, how, where and when we learn, and evaluate the alignment of today’s education and theory of learning with the current and forthcoming needs and challenges and to inform policymaking for future education.","Duraiappah, Anantha; van Atteveldt, Nienke; Asah, Stanley; Borst, Gregoire; Bugden, Stephanie; Buil, J.

Tratando de encontrar una herramienta adecuada para la formación y el debate dermatológico durante el confinamiento, se celebró un congreso médico “on-line” realizado entre los días 25 y 26 de abril del 2020. El objetivo del presente estudio fue evaluar las características, la opinión y el grado de satisfacción de los asistentes a dicho congreso. En segundo lugar, se buscó explicar cómo se organizó este formato de reunión. Material y métodos: Se entregó un cuestionario a los asistentes a un congreso “on-line” realizado a través de la aplicación Telegram® Messenger App. Se describió paso a paso su organización y planificación. No se necesitó apoyo financiero ya que fue realizado de manera voluntaria. Resultados: El grado de satisfacción tanto de los ponentes como la de los asistentes fue muy elevada. Todos los participantes consideraron que este formato tenía un gran presente y futuro. La mayoría lo calificó como superior a las reuniones presenciales tradicionales. El ser de género femenino y tener una práctica clínica predominantemente privada favorecieron esta opinión. Discusión: La pandemia obligó a cancelar la mayoría de las reuniones científicas presenciales. Esto fue visto por algunos autores como una excelente oportunidad para mejorar y liderar el cambio a las reuniones virtuales. Aunque el confinamiento no permitió un contacto real, nuestra reunión demostró que era posible asegurar la interacción entre los participantes. Los dermatólogos pudieron participar en una actividad formativa a pesar de que debido a las circunstancias se interrumpiera su actividad práctica diaria. La mayoría de los asistentes tuvieron la sensación de que esta era en una actividad nueva y atractiva, que superaba incluso a las reuniones presenciales tradicionales. Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic outbreak introduced dramatic changes in all our lives, daily practice, and medical conferences. In search of a tool to spread dermatologic knowledge during confinement, an online medical meeting was held on April 25th to 26th, 2020. In this study, we aimed to assess the characteristics, opinion and satisfaction of the attendees to a free-of-charge online congress. Secondarily, we intended to explain how this meeting was prepared. Methods: Online survey administered to the attendees to an online congress organised via the Telegram® Messenger App. Its organisation and planning, which needed no financial support and was done by volunteer organisers, moderators and speakers, is described step by step. Results: The satisfaction of both speakers and attendees was very high. All participants considered that this format had a great present and future, and most of them rated it as superior to regular face-to-face meetings. Female gender and predominantly private practice favoured this opinion. Discussion: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced the cancellation of most scientific gatherings. This has been seen by some authors as an excellent opportunity, encouraging medical societies and organisations to lead the change to virtual meetings. Although confinement did not allow real contact, our online meeting showed it was possible to ensure interaction and participation between attendees, moderators and speakers. Dermatologists enjoyed some dermatologic science, even despite the extraordinary circumstances disrupting their daily clinical practice. Most of them felt they were participating in something new and compelling that many felt superior to traditional meetings.","Martin-Gorgojo, A.; Bernabeu-Wittel, J.; Linares-Barrios, M.; Russo-De la Torre, F.; Garcia-Doval, I.; Del Rio-De la Torre, E.",Actas Dermosifiliogr,575,29

By questioning the possibility of reaching a balanced and sustainable state of functioning for social-ecological systems, resilience improves the static framework of sustainability by acknowledging non-linear behavior of complex systems, inevitability of change, and consistent presence of uncertainty. At the core of sustainable development, environmental policy is embedded in the socio-spatial structures that constantly re-organize and breed uncertainty, such as political, economic, and climate uncertainty. These uncertainties create episodes of instability that shock the entire system including the structures of environmental protection. In this article, focusing on the aftermath of 2016 US presidential election and 2018 general election in Brazil, both broadly recognized as political shocks, we highlight the vulnerabilities of environmental protection structures to the rise of conservative populist movements. We attribute these vulnerabilities, partially, to the superiority of market-based instruments, as well as apolitical understandings of resilience under neoliberalism that overlook political instabilities and socio-spatial outcomes of neoliberal restructuring projects. In our assessment, political unpreparedness of sustainability against the right-wing onslaught in the US and Brazil further underlines the need for resilience theory to incorporate sources of political instability in order to protect the environment.","Mostafavi, Nariman; Fiocchi, João; Dellacasa, Manuel García; Hoque, Simi",J Environ Stud Sci,575,21

Other notable findings from our survey revealed that after an initial decline in caseload reported in the early days of the pandemic, the majority of psychologists surveyed now report an increase in caseload, often necessitating the establishment of a waitlist. Respondents reported that their patients/clients are more accepting of telepsychology than in our previous survey. That said, a significant minority of psychologists expressed concerns that this technology will negatively affect their future practice.

Although concerns exist that exposure may be harmful, there is a poor understanding of the smoke in terms of particle size, morphology, composition and biological viability. Notably, it is not known how the biological tissue source and cutting method influence the smoke. The objective of this study was to develop a collection method for airborne by-product from surgical cutting. This would enable comprehensive analyses of the particulate burden, composition and biological viability. The method was applied to compare the electrosurgical smoke generated (in the absence of any evacuation mechanism) with the aerosolized/airborne by-products generated by ultrasonic and high-speed cutting, from bone and liver tissue cutting. We report a wide range of particle sizes (0.93–806.31 μm for bone, 0.05–1040.43 μm for liver) with 50% of the particles being <2.72 μm (~PM(2.5)) and 90% being <10 μm (PM(10)).

However, a major challenge that has limited the effectiveness of current vaccine candidates is the extensive global diversity of the HIV-1 envelope protein (Env), the sole target for HIV-neutralizing antibodies. To address this challenge, various strategies incorporating Env diversity into the vaccine formulation have been proposed. Here, we assessed the potential of two such strategies that utilize a nanoparticle-based vaccine platform to elicit broadly neutralizing antibody responses. The nanoparticle immunogens developed here consisted of different formulations of Envs from strains BG505 (clade A) and CZA97 (clade C), attached to the N-termini of bacterial ferritin. Single—antigen nanoparticle cocktails, as well as mosaic nanoparticles bearing both Env trimers, elicited high antibody titers in mice and guinea pigs. Furthermore, serum from guinea pigs immunized with nanoparticle immunogens achieved autologous, and in some cases heterologous, tier 2 neutralization, although significant differences between mosaic and single—antigen nanoparticles were not observed. These results provide insights into the ability of different vaccine strategies for incorporating Env sequence diversity to elicit neutralizing antibodies, with implications for the development of broadly protective HIV-1 vaccines.","Murji, Amyn A.; Qin, Juliana S.; Hermanus, Tandile; Morris, Lynn; Georgiev, Ivelin S.",Viruses,575,5

Among others, the use of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) is under investigation given their well‐documented anti‐inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. However, some critical issues regarding the possibility that MSCs could be infected by the virus have been raised. Angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and type II transmembrane serine protease (TMPRSS2) are the main host cell factors for the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome‐Coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) entry but so far it is unclear if human MSCs express or do not these two proteins. To elucidate these important aspects, we evaluated if human MSCs from both fetal and adult tissues constitutively express ACE2 and TMPRSS2 and, most importantly, if they can be infected by SARS‐CoV‐2. We evaluated human MSCs derived from amnios, cord blood, cord tissue, adipose tissue and bone marrow. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 were expressed by the SARS‐CoV‐2‐permissive human pulmonary Calu‐3 cell line but not by all the MSCs tested. MSCs were then exposed to SARS‐CoV‐2 wild strain without evidence of cytopathic effect. Moreover, we also excluded that the MSCs could be infected without showing lytic effects since their conditioned medium after SARS‐CoV‐2 exposure did not contain viral particles. Our data, demonstrating that MSCs derived from different human tissues are not permissive to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection, support the safety of MSCs as potential therapy for COVID‐19. © AlphaMed Press 2020 SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) are currently under investigation for the treatment of COVID‐19. However, the potential safety profile of hMSCs in this context has never been defined since none has described if they express ACE2 and TMPRSS2, the main host cell factors for SARS‐CoV‐2 entry, and if they can be infected by SARS‐CoV‐2. We provide the first evidence that ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are not expressed in hMSCs derived from both adult and fetal human tissues and, most importantly, that hMSCs are not permissive to SARS‐CoV‐2 infection. These results support the safety of MSCs as potential therapy for COVID‐19.","Avanzini, Maria A.; Mura, Manuela; Percivalle, Elena; Bastaroli, Francesca; Croce, Stefania; Valsecchi, Chiara; Lenta, Elisa; Nykjaer, Giulia; Cassaniti, Irene; Bagnarino, Jessica; Baldanti, Fausto; Zecca, Marco; Comoli, Patrizia; Gnecchi, Massimiliano",Stem Cells Transl Med,575,1

Western Hemisphere shrimp farmers in 14 countries in 2004 produced more than 200,000 metric tons of shrimp, generated more than $2 billion in revenue, and employed more than 500,000 people. Disease has had a major impact on shrimp aquaculture in the Americas since it became a significant commercial entity in the 1970s. Diseases due to viruses, rickettsial-like bacteria, true bacteria, protozoa, and fungi have emerged as major diseases of farmed shrimp in the region. Many of the bacterial, fungal and protozoan caused diseases are managed using improved culture practices, routine sanitation, and the use of chemotherapeutics. However, the virus diseases have been far more problematic to manage and they have been responsible for the most costly epizootics. Examples include the Taura syndrome pandemic that began in 1991–1992 when the disease emerged in Ecuador, and the subsequent White Spot Disease pandemic that followed its introduction to Central America from Asia in 1999. Because of their socioeconomic significance to shrimp farming, seven of the nine crustacean diseases listed by the World Animal Organization (OIE) are virus diseases of shrimp. Of the seven virus diseases of penaeid shrimp, five are native to the Americas or have become enzootic following their introduction. The shrimp virus diseases in the Americas are increasingly being managed by exclusion using a combination of biosecurity and the practice of culturing domesticated specific pathogen-free (SPF) stocks or specific pathogen-resistant (SPR) stocks. Despite the significant challenges posed by disease, the shrimp farming industry of the Americas has responded to the challenges posed by disease and it has developed methods to manage its diseases and mature into a sustainable industry.","Lightner, D.

Any successful engagement of a diaspora with its homeland is a function of sustained interaction between the two entities. In the absence of transparent engagement infrastructure, diaspora’s links with a developing economy are short-lived and, usually, sector, event, or location specific.

The effect of T2DM medications on COVID-19 outcomes remains unclear. In a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 131 patients with T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19 in Wuhan, we have previously found that metformin use prior to hospitalization is associated with reduced mortality. The current study aims to investigate the effects of inpatient use of T2DM medications, including metformin, acarbose, insulin and sulfonylureas, on the mortality of COVID-19 patients with T2DM during hospitalization. METHODS: We continue to carry out a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 131 patients with T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19 and treated with different combinations of diabetes medications. RESULTS: We found that patients using metformin (p = .02) and acarbose (p = .04), alone or both together (p = .03), after admission were significantly more likely to survive than those who did not use either metformin or acarbose. 37 patients continued to take metformin after admission and 35 (94.6%) survived. Among the 57 patients who used acarbose after admission, 52 survived (91.2%). A total of 20 patients used both metformin and acarbose, while 57 used neither. Of the 20 dual-use patients, 19 (95.0%) survived. CONCLUSION: Our analyses suggest that inpatient use of metformin and acarbose together or alone during hospitalization should be studied in randomized trials.","Li, Jinghong; Wei, Qi; McCowen, Karen C; Xiong, Wei; Liu, Jiao; Jiang, Wenlijun; Thomas, Robert L; Hepokoski, Mark; He, Ming; Shyy, John Y J; Malhotra, Atul; Xiong, Nian; Li, Willis X",Endocrinol Diabetes Metab,575,1

DNA vaccines represent an important alternative since they induce both humoral and cellular immune responses in animal models and in human trials. We tested the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of DNA-based vaccine regimens expressing different prefusion-stabilized SARS-CoV-2 Spike antigens upon intramuscular injection followed by electroporation in rhesus macaques. Different Spike DNA vaccine regimens induced antibodies that potently neutralized SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and elicited robust T cell responses. The DNA-only vaccine regimens were compared to a regimen that included co- immunization of Spike DNA and protein in the same anatomical site, the latter of which showed significant higher antibody responses. All vaccine regimens led to control of SARS-CoV-2 intranasal/intratracheal challenge and absence of virus dissemination to the lower respiratory tract. Vaccine-induced binding and neutralizing antibody titers and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis inversely correlated with transient virus levels in the nasal mucosa. Importantly, the Spike DNA+Protein co-immunization regimen induced the highest binding and neutralizing antibodies and showed the strongest control against SARS-CoV-2 challenge in rhesus macaques. Author summary Anti-Spike neutralizing antibodies provide strong protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in animal models, and correlate with protection in humans, supporting the notion that induction of strong humoral immunity is key to protection. We show induction of robust antibody and T cell responses by different Spike DNA-based vaccine regimens able to effectively mediate protection and to control SARS-CoV-2 infection in the rhesus macaque model. This study provides the opportunity to compare vaccines able to induce different humoral and cellular immune responses in an effort to develop durable immunity against the SARS-CoV-2. A vaccine regimen comprising simultaneous co-immunization of DNA and Protein at the same anatomical site showed best neutralizing abilities and was more effective than DNA alone in inducing protective immune responses and controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, an expansion of the DNA vaccine regimen to include co-immunization with Spike protein may be of advantage also for SARS-CoV-2.","Rosati, Margherita; Agarwal, Mahesh; Hu, Xintao; Devasundaram, Santhi; Stellas, Dimitris; Chowdhury, Bhabadeb; Bear, Jenifer; Burns, Robert; Donohue, Duncan; Pessaint, Laurent; Andersen, Hanne; Lewis, Mark G.; Terpos, Evangelos; Dimopoulos, Meletios Athanasios; Wlodawer, Alexander; Mullins, James I.; Venzon, David.

The article seeks to tease out the role of the EU amidst the COVID-19 crisis by outlining three key dimensions: self-perception, external perception and performance. The paper contributes to the broader understanding of the EU's role in global health through a focus on its self-perception. This is examined by the conduct of interviews with EU representatives in 2021 and the analysis of EU press releases with reference to global health from 2014 to mid-March 2021. The results show that the EU mainly draws from a donor and provider role leaving a facilitating, partner or normative role underdeveloped – except for the EU's leading role in the context of the World Health Organisation. The COVID-19 pandemic is a driver for a more ambitious global political role. However, the main challenges identified by EU representatives constitute a lack of capacities and resources, insufficient backing by EU member states and a lack of coordination. The strongest EU conception in global health is seen when policy actions are based on multiple roles ranging from a provider and partner to a facilitating or normative role.","Bergner, Susan",Health Policy,575,16

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association between the rate of human mobility changes and the rate of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study used daily travel distance and home dwell time derived from millions of anonymous mobile phone location data from March 11 to April 10, 2020, provided by the Descartes Labs and SafeGraph to quantify the degree to which social distancing mandates were followed in the 50 US states and District of Columbia and the association of mobility changes with rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. EXPOSURE: State-level stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcome was the association of state-specific rates of COVID-19 confirmed cases with the change rates of median travel distance and median home dwell time of anonymous mobile phone users. The increase rates are measured by the exponent in curve fitting of the COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases, while the mobility change (increase or decrease) rates were measured by the slope coefficient in curve fitting of median travel distance and median home dwell time for each state. RESULTS: Data from more than 45 million anonymous mobile phone devices were analyzed. The correlation between the COVID-19 increase rate and travel distance decrease rate was –0.586 (95% CI, –0.742 to –0.370) and the correlation between COVID-19 increase rate and home dwell time increase rate was 0.526 (95% CI, 0.293 to 0.700). Increases in state-specific doubling time of total cases ranged from 1.0 to 6.9 days (median [interquartile range], 2.7 [2.3-3.3] days) before stay-at-home orders were enacted to 3.7 to 30.3 days (median [interquartile range], 6.0 [4.8-7.1] days) after stay-at-home social distancing orders were put in place, consistent with pandemic modeling results. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest that stay-at-home social distancing mandates, when they were followed by measurable mobility changes, were associated with reduction in COVID-19 spread. These results come at a particularly critical period when US states are beginning to relax social distancing policies and reopen their economies. These findings support the efficacy of social distancing and could help inform future implementation of social distancing policies should they need to be reinstated during later periods of COVID-19 reemergence.","Gao, Song; Rao, Jinmeng; Kang, Yuhao; Liang, Yunlei; Kruse, Jake; Dopfer, Dorte; Sethi, Ajay K.; Mandujano Reyes, Juan Francisco; Yandell, Brian S.; Patz, Jonathan A.",JAMA Netw Open,575,24

The need to increase capacity for SARS-CoV-2 testing in a variety of settings, combined with shortages of sample collection supplies, have motivated a search for alternative sample types with high sensitivity. We systematically reviewed the literature to understand the performance of alternative sample types compared to NP swabs. We systematically searched PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, and bioRxiv (last retrieval 1 October 2020) for comparative studies of alternative specimen types (saliva, oropharyngeal [OP], and nasal [NS] swabs) versus NP swabs for SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using nucleic acid amplification testing (NAAT). A logistic-normal random-effects meta-analysis was performed to calculate % positive alternative-specimen, % positive NP, and % dual positives overall and in subgroups. The QUADAS 2 tool was used to assess bias. From 1,253 unique citations, we identified 25 saliva, 11 NS, 6 OP, and 4 OP/NS studies meeting inclusion criteria. Three specimen types captured lower % positives (NS [82%, 95% CI: 73 to 90%], OP [84%, 95% CI: 57 to 100%], and saliva [88%, 95% CI: 81 to 93%]) than NP swabs, while combined OP/NS matched NP performance (97%, 95% CI: 90 to 100%). Absence of RNA extraction (saliva) and utilization of a more sensitive NAAT (NS) substantially decreased alternative-specimen yield of positive samples. NP swabs remain the gold standard for diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2, although alternative specimens are promising. Much remains unknown about the impact of variations in specimen collection, processing protocols, and population (pediatric versus adult, late versus early in disease course), such that head-to head studies of sampling strategies are urgently needed.","Lee, Rose A.; Herigon, Joshua C.; Benedetti, Andrea; Pollock, Nira R.; Denkinger, Claudia M.",J Clin Microbiol,575,6

These different subphenotypes likely have variable clinical responses to specific therapies, a concept known as heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE). Recognizing different subphenotypes and HTE has important implications for the clinical management of patients with ARDS. In this review, we will present studies that have identified different subphenotypes and discuss how they can modify the effects of therapies evaluated in trials that are commonly considered to have demonstrated no overall benefit in patients with ARDS.","Khan, Yasin A.; Fan, Eddy; Ferguson, Niall D.",Chest,575,1

A steep worsening of such symptoms has been reported during Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, their causes, their impact on everyday life, and treatment strategies have not been systematically assessed. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide a detailed description of behavioral and psychopathological alterations in subjects with dementia during COVID-19 pandemic and the associated management challenges. METHODS: A PubMed search was performed focusing on studies reporting alterations in behavior and mood and treatment strategies for elderly patients with dementia, in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. The following search strategy was utilized: (COVID* OR coronavirus OR “corona vir*” OR SARS-CoV-2) AND (dementia OR demented OR dement* OR alzheimer* OR “pick’s disease” OR “lewy body” OR “mild cognitive” OR mild cognitive impairment OR MCI). RESULTS: Apathy, anxiety and agitation are the most frequently NPS during the COVID-19 pandemic and are mainly triggered by protracted isolation. Most treatment strategies rely on pharmacotherapy; technology is increasingly utilized with mixed results. CONCLUSIONS: NPS of dementia during COVID-19 appear to arise from social restrictions occurring as a consequence of the pandemic. Implementation of caregiver support and the presence of skilled nursing home staff are required to restore social interaction and adjust technological support to the patients’ needs.","Simonetti, Alessio; Pais, Cristina; Jones, Melissa; Cipriani, Maria Camilla; Janiri, Delfina; Monti, Laura; Landi, Francesco; Bernabei, Roberto; Liperoti, Rosa; Sani, Gabriele",Front Psychiatry,575,7

AIM: To find a specific imaging feature of the disease would be a welcome guide in diagnosis and management of challenging cases. METHODS: Chest CT imaging findings of 650 patients admitted to a university Hospital in Tehran, Iran between January 2020 and July 2020 with confirmed COVID-19 infection by RT-PCR were reviewed by two expert radiologists. In addition to common non-specific imaging findings of COVID-19 pneumonia, radiologic characteristics of “pulmonary target sign” (PTS) were assessed. PTS is defined as a circular appearance of non-involved pulmonary parenchyma, which encompass a central hyperdense dot surrounded by ground-glass or alveolar opacities. RESULTS: PTS were presented in 32 cases (frequency 4.9%). The location of the lesions in 31 of the 32 cases (96.8%) was peripheral, while 4 of the 31 cases had lesions both peripherally and centrally. In 25 cases, the lesions were located near the pleural surface and considered pleural based and half of the lesions (at least one lesion) were in the lower segments and lobes of the lungs. 22 cases had multiple lesions with a > 68% frequency. More than 87% of cases had an adjacent bronchovascular bundle. Ground-glass opacities were detectable adjacent or close to the lesions in 30 cases (93%) and only in 7 cases (21%) was consolidation adjacent to the lesions.

The current COVID-19 pandemic has affected substantially this high-risk population group. This present review was done to ascertain whether or not the pandemic has affected the 30-day mortality and outcomes of hip fracture in the elderly. RESEARCH QUESTION: Does the coexistence of COVID-19 infection and hip fractures in the elderly increase the mortality rates? METHODOLOGY: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using three databases (PubMed, EMBASE and SCOPUS) to compare the mortality rates between COVID-19 positive/suspect and COVID-19 negative patients. The secondary outcomes included comparison of in-hospital mortality, complication rate and length of hospital stay. Risk of bias assessment was done using the MINORS tool. RESULTS: The present review included 20 studies. Primary outcome: A significantly higher 30 day mortality rate was seen in COVID-19 positive/suspect patients with an Odds ratio of 6.09 (95% CI 4.75–8.59, p < 0.00001). Secondary outcome: We observed significantly higher rates of inpatient mortality [OR 18.22, (95% CI 7.10–46.75], complication rate (OR 9.28, 95% CI 4.46–19.30), and length of hospital stay (MD: 4.96, 95% CI 2.86–7.05) in COVID-19 positive/suspect patients as compared to COVID-19 negative patients. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 has deteriorated the outcomes in elderly patients with hip fractures and associated with higher rates of mortality in the short term.

As a result, children may be susceptible to anxiety and digital eye strain, highlighting a need for population interventions. OBJECTIVE: The objective of our study was to investigate whether a digital behavior change intervention aimed at promoting physical activity could reduce children’s anxiety and digital eye strain while undergoing prolonged homeschooling during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: In this cluster randomized controlled trial, homeschooled grade 7 students at 12 middle schools in southern China were recruited through local schools and randomly assigned by the school to receive (1:1 allocation): (1) health education information promoting exercise and ocular relaxation, and access to a digital behavior change intervention, with live streaming and peer sharing of promoted activities (intervention), or (2) health education information only (control). The primary outcome was change in self-reported anxiety score. Secondary outcomes included change in self-reported eye strain and sleep quality. RESULTS: On March 16, 2020, 1009 children were evaluated, and 954 (94.5%) eligible children of consenting families were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. Children in the intervention (n=485, 6 schools) and control (n=469, 6 schools) groups were aged 13.5 (SD 0.5) years, and 52.3% (n=499) were male. The assigned interventions were completed by 896 children (intervention: n=467, 96.3%; control: n=429, 91.5%). The 2-week change in square-root–transformed self-reported anxiety scores was greater in the intervention (–0.23, 95% CI –0.27 to –0.20) vs control group (0.12, 95% CI 0.09-0.16; unadjusted difference –0.36, 95% CI –0.63 to –0.08; P=.02).

In many cases, the unavailability of medicinal products has a substantial impact on the capability of National Healthcare Systems in ensuring the continuity of care. Shortages originate from multifactorial causes. In particular, they can be due to supply-related factors (e.g., manufacturing issues, regulatory issues, logistics, distribution) and demand-related ones (e.g., fluctuating drug demand, parallel market, tendering, price and reimbursement policies). However, some extraordinary geopolitical events (e.g., Brexit) may also affect medicines’ availability. The capability of European Regulatory Authorities and other stakeholders, which are involved in the pharmaceutical distribution chain and the healthcare assistance services, to define suitable problem-solving strategies has been limited for years by the fragmentation of the European regulatory framework, starting from the lack of a univocal definition of a medicine shortage. Only in 2019, the EMA and HMA joint task force released the first harmonized “shortage” definition in the European Economic Area (EEA) and guidance on public communication. This manuscript aims to review the current European regulatory framework on medicine shortages. To support the activities of regulators, manufacturers and other healthcare professionals, an algorithm was also proposed to be used as a harmonized procedure to determine the shortage/unavailability impact on public health and to rationalize the problem-solving strategies adopted in all different settings.","Musazzi, Umberto M.; Di Giorgio, Domenico; Minghetti, Paola",Int J Pharm,575,2

Presently, measurement of blood glucose is a factor for concern mostly when treating individuals with diabetes. Significance of blood glucose measurement in prognosis of non-diabetic and hospitalized patients is not clear. METHODS: A systematic search of literature published in the Electronic databases, PubMed and Google Scholar was performed using following keywords; blood glucose, hospital admissions, critical illness, hospitalizations, cardiovascular disease (CVD), morbidity, and mortality. This literature search was largely restricted to non-diabetic individuals. RESULTS: Blood glucose level, even when in high normal range, or in slightly high range, is an important determinant of morbidity and mortality, especially in hospitalized patients. Further, even slight elevation of blood glucose may increase mortality in patients with COVID-19. Finally, blood glucose variability and hypoglycemia in critically ill individuals without diabetes causes excess in-hospital complications and mortality. CONCLUSION: In view of these data, we emphasize the significance of blood glucose measurement in all patients admitted to the hospital regardless of presence of diabetes. We propose that blood glucose be included as the “fifth vital sign” for any hospitalized patient.","Kesavadev, Jothydev; Misra, Anoop; Saboo, Banshi; Aravind, S.R.; Hussain, Akhtar; Czupryniak, Leszek; Raz, Itamar",Diabetes Metab Syndr,575,5

Study design This is a longitudinal mortality study. Methods For men and women aged 65–74 years or those older than 85 years in South East England, the relationship between daily mortality (deaths per million population) and outdoor temperatures below 18 °C, with allowance for influenza epidemics, was assessed by linear regression on an annual basis. The regression coefficients were expressed as a percentage of the mortality at 18 °C to adjust for changes in mortality through health care. Trends in ‘specific’ cold-related mortalities were then examined over two periods, 1977–1994 and 1995–2016. Results In contrast to the early period, annual trends in cold-related specific mortalities showed no decline between 1995 and 2016. ‘Specific’ cold-related mortality of women, but not men, in the age group older than 85 years showed a significant increase over the 1995–2016 period, which was different from the trend over the earlier period (P < 0.01). Conclusion Despite state-funded benefits to help alleviate fuel poverty and public health advice, very elderly women appear to be at increasing risk of cold-related mortality—greater help may be necessary.","Donaldson, G.

Currently, literature of SARS-CoV-2 in neonates is scarce. We present a case of a neonate with a high viral load and prolonged virus shedding. METHODS: Epidemiology, clinical characteristics, treatment, laboratory data and follow-up information and the treatment of a neonate with COVID-19 were recorded. RESULTS: A 7-day-old boy was admitted to the hospital with fever, lethargy and apnoea. He was found SARS-CoV-2 RNA positive with an exceptionally high viral load in nasopharyngeal swab and stool. The father and two maternity nurses at home had detectable SARS-CoV-2 RNA as well. Sequencing showed all strains belonged to the same cluster. The father was asymptomatic and the maternity nurses developed symptoms after visiting. In the mother, no SARS-CoV-2 RNA could be found. Six days after admission, the neonate was discharged after clinical improvement with oral antibiotics because of a possible pyelonephritis. Monitoring the course of this infection showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detectable in the nasopharynx until day 19 and in stool until day 42 after symptom onset. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that neonates can have a high viral load of SARS-CoV-2 and can shed the virus for over one month in stool. Despite the high viral load in the neonate, the mother and a sibling did not get infected.","Slaats, Monique A.L.J.; Versteylen, Maud; Gast, Karin B.; Munnink, Bas B.

Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is responsible for sporadic infections in mostly Middle Eastern countries, with occasional transfer elsewhere. A key step in the MERS-CoV replication cycle is the fusion of the virus and host cell membranes mediated by the virus spike protein, S. The location of the fusion peptide within the MERS S protein has not been precisely mapped. We used isolated peptides and giant unilamellar vesicles (GUV) to demonstrate membrane binding for a peptide located near the N-terminus of the S2 domain. Key residues required for activity were mapped by amino acid replacement and their relevance in vitro tested by their introduction into recombinant MERS S protein expressed in mammalian cells. Mutations preventing membrane binding in vitro also abolished S-mediated syncytium formation consistent with the identified peptide acting as the fusion peptide for the S protein of MERS-CoV.","Alsaadi, Entedar A.

This in turn led to a reduction in air pollution around the world. It is important to quantify the extent of that reduction in order to estimate the weight of the impact of air and motor traffic and industrial activities over the total variation of air quality. An assessment of the extent of air pollution is aimed at facilitating the crafting of policies toward the reduction of pollution and the improvement in air quality. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on air pollution in Israel. Particularly, we focus on Haifa and Greater Tel-Aviv (Gush-Dan), two regions with high air pollution, while examining different types of air monitoring stations. The period to which we refer to is March 8, 2020, to May 2, 2020. The results reveal two main findings: (1) During the COVID-19 lockdown, pollution emissions decreased relative to the same period in 2019. The biggest reduction was observed in NO(x), which, on average, was 41%. Surprisingly, ground-level ozone (O(3)) increased, and appeared to behave similarly to the ozone weekend effect. (2) The total percentage variation in pollution emission that was explained by the lockdown was at most 26%. By adding the meteorological conditions (which included measures of wind direction, wind speed, and temperature) as a factor in addition to the lockdown effect, this percent increased to 47%.","Agami, Sarit; Dayan, Uri",Atmos Environ (1994),575,1

As the early-stage and entry-level product of the voice-enabled smart home industry, the smart speakers have been going through rapid development and rising fierce market competition globally in recent years. China, one of the most populous and largest markets in the world, has tremendous business potential in the smart home industry. The market sales of smart speakers in China have gone through rapid growth in the past three years. However, the market penetration rate of related smart home devices and equipment still stays extremely low and far from mass adoption. Moreover, the market sales of smart speakers have also entered a significant slowdown and adjustment period since 2020. Chinese consumers have moved from early impulsive consumption to a rational consumption phase about this early-stage smart home product. Trust in the marketing field is considered an indispensable component of all business transactions, which plays a crucial role in adopting new technologies. This study explores the influencing factors of Chinese users’ perceived trust in the voice-enabled smart home systems, uses structural equation modeling (SEM) to analyze the interaction mechanism between different variables, and establishes a perceived trust model through 475 valid samples. The model includes six variables: system quality, familiarity, subjective norm, technology optimism, perceived enjoyment, and perceived trust. The result shows that system quality is the essential influence factor that impacts all other variables and could significantly affect the perceived trust. Perceived enjoyment is the most direct influence variable affected by system quality, subjective norm, and technology optimism, and it positively affects the perceived trust in the end. The subjective norm is one of the most distinguishing variables for Chinese users, since China has a collectivist consumption culture. People always expect their behavior to meet social expectations and standards to avoid criticism and acquire social integration. Therefore, policy guidance, authoritative opinions, and people with important reference roles will significantly affect consumers’ perceived trust and purchase intention. Familiarity and technology optimism are important influential factors that will have an indirect impact on the perceived trust. The related results of this study can help designers, practitioners, and researchers of the smart home industry produce products and services with higher perceived trust to improve consumers’ adoption and acceptance so that the market penetration rate of related products and enterprises could be increased, and the maturity and development of the voice-enabled smart home industry could be promoted.","Liu, Yuqi; Gan, Yan; Song, Yao; Liu, Jing",Sensors (Basel),575,5

These interactions change according to health status and are modified by factors such as age and sex. For several physiological processes, sex-based distinctions in normal physiology are present and defined in isolation. However, new methodologies are indispensable to analyze system-wide properties and interactions with the objective of exploring differences between sexes. Here we propose a new method to construct complex inferential networks from a normalization using the clinical criteria for health of physiological variables, and the correlations between anthropometric and blood tests biomarkers of 198 healthy young participants (117 women, 81 men, from 18 to 27 years old). Physiological networks of men have less correlations, displayed higher modularity, higher small-world index, but were more vulnerable to directed attacks, whereas networks of women were more resilient. The networks of both men and women displayed sex-specific connections that are consistent with the literature. Additionally, we carried out a time-series study on heart rate variability (HRV) using Physionet’s Fantasia database. Autocorrelation of HRV, variance, and Poincare’s plots, as a measure of variability, are statistically significant higher in young men and statistically significant different from young women. These differences are attenuated in older men and women, that have similar HRV distributions. The network approach revealed differences in the association of variables related to glucose homeostasis, nitrogen balance, kidney function, and fat depots. The clusters of physiological variables and their roles within the network remained similar regardless of sex. Both methodologies show a higher number of associations between variables in the physiological system of women, implying redundant mechanisms of control and simultaneously showing that these systems display less variability in time than those of men, constituting a more resilient system.","Barajas-Martínez, Antonio; Ibarra-Coronado, Elizabeth; Fossion, Ruben; Toledo-Roy, Juan Claudio; Martínez-Garcés, Vania; López-Rivera, Juan Antonio; Tello-Santoyo, Geraldine; Lavin, Rusland D.; Gómez, José Luis; Stephens, Christopher R.; Aguilar-Salinas, Carlos A.; Estañol, Bruno; Torres, Nimbe; Tovar, Armando R.; Resendis-Antonio, Osbaldo; Hiriart, Marcia; Frank, Alejandro; Rivera, Ana Leonor",Front Physiol,575,20

METHODS: This study is a cohort study of symptomatic patients presenting to a single emergency department (ED) with laboratory‐confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2 infection from March 7‐August 9, 2020. We collected patient‐level information regarding demographics, insurance status, comorbidities, level of care, and mortality using a structured chart review. We compared characteristics of patients categorized by (1) home discharge, (2) general hospital ward admission, and (3) intensive care unit (ICU) admission or death within 30 days of the index visit. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to report odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) between hospital admission versus ED discharge home and between ICU care versus general hospital ward admission. RESULTS: In total, 994 patients who presented to the ED with symptoms were included in the analysis with 551 (55.4%) patients discharged home, 314 (31.6%) patients admitted to the general hospital ward, and 129 (13.0%) admitted to the ICU or dying. Patients requiring admission were more likely to be Black or to have public insurance (Medicaid and/or Medicare). Patients who were admitted to the ICU or dying were more likely aged ≥ 65 years or male. In multivariable logistic regression, old age, public insurance, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, heart failure, and hyperlipidemia were independent predictors of hospital admission. When comparing those who needed ICU care versus general hospital ward admission in univariate logistic regression, patients with Medicaid (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.2–4.6), Medicare (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.1–8.4), Medicaid and Medicare (OR 4.3, 95% CI 2.4–7.7), history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.2–4.2), hypertension (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1–2.7), and heart failure (OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.4–4.7) were more likely to be admitted into the ICU or die; Black (OR 1.1, 95% CI 0.4–2.9) and Hispanic/Latino (OR 1.0, 95% CI 0.6–1.8) patients were less likely to be admitted into the ICU; however, the associations were not statistically significant. In multivariable logistic regression, old age, male sex, public insurance, and heart failure were independent predictors of ICU care/death. CONCLUSION: Comorbidities and public insurance are predictors of more severe illness for patients with SARS‐CoV‐2. This study suggests that the disparities in severity seen in COVID‐19 among Black patients may be attributable, in part, to low socioeconomic status and chronic health conditions.","Newton, Sophia; Zollinger, Benjamin; Freeman, Jincong; Moran, Seamus; Helfand, Alexandra; Authelet, Kayla; McHarg, Matthew; Montano Vargas, Nataly; Shesser, Robert; Cohen, Joanna S.; Cummings, Derek A.T.; Ma, Yan; Meltzer, Andrew C.",J Am Coll Emerg Physicians Open,575,22

METHODS: This single-centre, observational, cross-sectional study included 211 patients with COVID-19 admitted to non-ICU departments who underwent a single transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Patients with poor acoustic window (n=11) were excluded. Clinical, imaging, laboratory and TTE findings were compared in patients with versus without PH (estimated systolic pulmonary artery pressure >35 mm Hg) and with versus without RVD (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion <17 mm or S wave <9.5 cm/s). The primary endpoint was in-hospital death or ICU admission. RESULTS: A total of 200 patients were included in the final analysis (median age 62 (IQR 52–74) years, 65.5% men). The prevalence of PH and RVD was 12.0% (24/200) and 14.5% (29/200), respectively. Patients with PH were older and had a higher burden of pre-existing cardiac comorbidities and signs of more severe severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (radiological lung involvement, laboratory findings and oxygenation status) compared with those without PH. Conversely, patients with RVD had a higher burden of pre-existing cardiac comorbidities but no evidence of more severe SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with those without RVD. The presence of PH was associated with a higher rate of in-hospital death or ICU admission (41.7 vs 8.5%, p<0.001), while the presence of RVD was not (17.2 vs 11.7%, p=0.404).
