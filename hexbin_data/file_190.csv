458,458,458,Willingness to accept H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine: A cross-sectional study of Hong Kong community nurses,14.563003,10.505436,2010-10-29,"BACKGROUND: The 2009 pandemic of influenza A (H1N1) infection has alerted many governments to make preparedness plan to control the spread of influenza A (H1N1) infection. Vaccination for influenza is one of the most important primary preventative measures to reduce the disease burden. Our study aims to assess the willingness of nurses who work for the community nursing service (CNS) in Hong Kong on their acceptance of influenza A (H1N1) influenza vaccination. METHODS: 401 questionnaires were posted from June 24, 2009 to June 30, 2009 to community nurses with 67% response rate. Results of the 267 respondents on their willingness to accept influenza A (H1N1) vaccine were analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-seven percent of respondents were willing to accept influenza vaccination if vaccines were available. Having been vaccinated for seasonable influenza in the previous 12 months were significantly independently associated with their willingness to accept influenza A (H1N1) vaccination (OR = 4.03; 95% CI: 2.03-7.98). CONCLUSIONS: Similar to previous findings conducted in hospital healthcare workers and nurses, we confirmed that the willingness of community nurses to accept influenza A (H1N1) vaccination is low. Future studies that evaluate interventions to address nurses' specific concerns or interventions that aim to raise the awareness among nurses on the importance of influenza A (H1N1) vaccination to protect vulnerable patient populations is needed.","Wong, Samuel YS; Wong, Eliza LY; Chor, Josette; Kung, Kenny; Chan, Paul KS; Wong, Carmen; Griffiths, Sian M",BMC Infect Dis,190,3
621,621,621,"Unusual association of ST-T abnormalities, myocarditis and cardiomyopathy with H(1)N(1 )influenza in pregnancy: two case reports and review of the literature",14.980481,10.617311,2011-07-14,"INTRODUCTION: Myocarditis is rarely reported as an extra-pulmonary manifestation of influenza while pregnancy is a rare cause of cardiomyopathy. Pregnancy was identified as a major risk factor for increased mortality and morbidity due to H(1)N(1 )influenza in the pandemic of 2009 to 2010. However, to the best of our knowledge there are no previous reports in the literature linking H(1)N(1 )with myocarditis in pregnancy. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the cases of two pregnant Caucasian women (aged 29 and 30), with no pre-existing illness, presenting with respiratory manifestations of H(1)N(1 )influenza virus infection in their third trimester. Both women developed evidence of myocarditis. One woman developed acute respiratory distress syndrome, almost reaching the point of requiring extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation, and subsequently developed persistent cardiomyopathy; the other recovered without any long-term consequence. CONCLUSIONS: While it is not possible to ascertain retrospectively if myocarditis was caused by either infection with H(1)N(1 )virus or as a result of pregnancy (in the absence of endomyocardial biopsies), the significant association with myocardial involvement in both women demonstrates the increased risk of exposure to H(1)N(1 )influenza virus in pregnant women. This highlights the need for health care providers to increase awareness amongst caregivers to target this 'at risk' group aggressively with vaccination and prompt treatment.","Chan, Karen; Meek, David; Chakravorty, Indranil",J Med Case Reports,190,0
635,635,635,Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of childhood pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus infection: an observational cohort study,14.952031,10.589267,2011-08-24,"BACKGROUND: There was a pandemic influenza around the world in 2009 including South Korea since last pandemic occurred four decades ago. We aimed to evaluate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of this infection in childhood. METHODS: We evaluated the epidemiologic characteristics of all the subjects infected with the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus (2,971 patients, ≤ 15 years of age), and the clinical and laboratory findings of the inpatients (217 patients, 80 had pneumonia) between 1 September 2009 and 31 January 2010 in a single hospital throughout the epidemic. RESULTS: The age distribution of all the subjects was relatively even. Over 90% of cases occurred during a two-month period. Two hundred and five patients (94.5%) received oseltamivir within 48 h of fever onset, and 97% of inpatients defervesced within 48 h of medication. The group with pneumonia included more males than females, and had higher leukocytes counts with lower lymphocyte differentials than the group without pneumonia. The white blood cell count and lymphocyte differential were associated with the severity of pneumonia. Corticosteroid treatment for severe pneumonia patients was highly effective in preventing disease progression. CONCLUSION: Children of all ages affected with even rates of infection, but males were predominant in pneumonia patients. Pneumonia patients showed lymphopenia and its severity was associated with the severity of illness. Our results suggest that the mechanism of lung injury in 2009 H1N1 virus infection may be associated with the host immune response.","Rhim, Jung-Woo; Lee, Kyung-Yil; Youn, You-Sook; Kang, Jin-Han; Kim, Ji-Chang",BMC Infect Dis,190,3
680,680,680,Respiratory failure presenting in H1N1 influenza with Legionnaires disease: two case reports,15.02136,10.499708,2011-10-21,"INTRODUCTION: Media sensationalism on the H1N1 outbreak may have influenced decisional processes and clinical diagnosis. CASE PRESENTATION: We report two cases of patients who presented in 2009 with coexisting H1N1 virus and Legionella infections: a 69-year-old Caucasian man and a 71-year-old Caucasian woman. In our cases all the signs and symptoms, including vomiting, progressive respiratory disease leading to respiratory failure, refractory hypoxemia, leukopenia, lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated levels of creatine kinase and hepatic aminotransferases, were consistent with critical illness due to 2009 H1N1 virus infection. Other infectious disorders may mimic H1N1 viral infection especially Legionnaires' disease. Because the swine flu H1N1 pandemic occurred in Autumn in Italy, Legionnaires disease was to be highly suspected since the peak incidence usually occurs in early fall. We do think that our immediate suspicion of Legionella infection based on clinical history and X-ray abnormalities was fundamental for a successful resolution. CONCLUSION: Our two case reports suggest that patients with H1N1 should be screened for Legionella, which is not currently common practice. This is particularly important since the signs and symptoms of both infections are similar.","Iannuzzi, Michele; De Robertis, Edoardo; Piazza, Ornella; Rispoli, Fabio; Servillo, Giuseppe; Tufano, Rosalba",J Med Case Reports,190,0
738,738,738,Effect modification of environmental factors on influenza-associated mortality: a time-series study in two Chinese cities,14.779198,10.692351,2011-12-14,"BACKGROUND: Environmental factors have been associated with transmission and survival of influenza viruses but no studies have ever explored the role of environmental factors on severity of influenza infection. METHODS: We applied a Poisson regression model to the mortality data of two Chinese metropolitan cities located within the subtropical zone, to calculate the influenza associated excess mortality risks during the periods with different levels of temperature and humidity. RESULTS: The results showed that high absolute humidity (measured by vapor pressure) was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with increased risks of all-cause and cardiorespiratory deaths, but not with increased risks of pneumonia and influenza deaths. The association between absolute humidity and mortality risks was found consistent among the two cities. An increasing pattern of influenza associated mortality risks was also found across the strata of low to high relative humidity, but the results were less consistent for temperature. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight the need for people with chronic cardiovascular and respiratory diseases to take extra caution against influenza during hot and humid days in the subtropics and tropics.","Yang, Lin; Chen, Ping Yan; He, Jian Feng; Chan, King Pan; Ou, Chun Quan; Deng, Ai Ping; Malik Peiris, JS; Wong, Chit Ming",BMC Infect Dis,190,3
1202,1202,1202,"China’s biggest, most neglected health challenge: Non-communicable diseases",14.810445,10.317141,2013-04-05,"BACKGROUND: Over the past two decades, international health policies focusing on the fight against the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), tuberculosis (TB), malaria, and those diseases that address maternal and child health problems, among others, have skewed disease control priorities in China and other Asian countries. Although these are important health problems, an epidemic of chronic, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in China has accounted for a much greater burden of disease due to the ongoing rapid socioeconomic and demographic transition. DISCUSSION: Although NCDs currently account for more than 80% of the overall disease burden in China, they remain very low on the nation’s disease control priorities, attracting marginal investment from central and local governments. This leaves the majority of patients with chronic conditions without effective treatment. International organizations and national governments have recognized the devastating social and economic consequences caused by NCDs in low- and middle-income countries, including China. Yet, few donor-funded projects that address NCDs have been implemented in these countries over the past decade. Due to a lack of strong support from international organizations and national governments for fighting against NCDs, affected persons in China, especially the poor and those who live in rural and less developed regions, continue to have limited access to the needed care. Costs associated with frequent health facility visits and regular treatment have become a major factor in medical impoverishment in China. This article argues that although China's ongoing health system reform would provide a unique opportunity to tackle current public health problems, it may not be sufficient to address the emerging threat of NCDs unless targeted steps are taken to assure that adequate financial and human resources are mapped for effective control and management of NCDs in the country. SUMMARY: The Chinese government needs to develop a domestically-driven and evidence-based disease control policy and funding priorities that respond appropriately to the country’s current epidemiological transition, and rapid sociodemographic and lifestyle changes.","Tang, Shenglan; Ehiri, John; Long, Qian",Infect Dis Poverty,190,3

1456,1456,1456,Phenotyping community-acquired pneumonia according to the presence of acute respiratory failure and severe sepsis,14.755194,10.831828,2014-03-04,"BACKGROUND: Acute respiratory failure (ARF) and severe sepsis (SS) are possible complications in patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). The aim of the study was to evaluate prevalence, characteristics, risk factors and impact on mortality of hospitalized patients with CAP according to the presence of ARF and SS on admission. METHODS: This was a multicenter, observational, prospective study of consecutive CAP patients admitted to three hospitals in Italy, Spain, and Scotland between 2008 and 2010. Three groups of patients were identified: those with neither ARF nor SS (Group A), those with only ARF (Group B) and those with both ARF and SS (Group C) on admission. RESULTS: Among the 2,145 patients enrolled, 45% belonged to Group A, 36% to Group B and 20% to Group C. Patients in Group C were more severe than patients in Group B. Isolated ARF was correlated with age (p < 0.001), COPD (p < 0.001) and multilobar infiltrates (p < 0.001). The contemporary occurrence of ARF and SS was associated with age (p = 0.002), residency in nursing home (p = 0.007), COPD (p < 0.001), multilobar involvement (p < 0.001) and renal disease (p < 0.001). 4.2% of patients in Group A died, 9.3% in Group B and 26% in Group C, p < 0.001. After adjustment, the presence of only ARF had an OR for in-hospital mortality of 1.85 (p = 0.011) and the presence of both ARF and SS had an OR of 6.32 (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The identification of ARF and SS on hospital admission can help physicians in classifying CAP patients into three different clinical phenotypes.","Aliberti, Stefano; Brambilla, Anna Maria; Chalmers, James D; Cilloniz, Catia; Ramirez, Julio; Bignamini, Angelo; Prina, Elena; Polverino, Eva; Tarsia, Paolo; Pesci, Alberto; Torres, Antoni; Blasi, Francesco; Cosentini, Roberto",Respir Res,190,9

The majority of human cases were detected in mainland China; other regions out of mainland China reported imported human cases, including Hong Kong SAR, Taiwan (the Republic of China) and Malaysia, due to human transportation. Here, we report the first human case of H7N9 infection imported into Guizhou Province during the Spring Festival travel season in January 2014. CASE PRESENTATION: In early January 2014, a 38-year-old healthy Chinese man, a migrant worker returning from previously H7N9-affected Zhejiang Province, was identified as the first human case of infection with avian influenza A(H7N9) virus in Guizhou Province. He developed fever in Zhejiang at the beginning of January 2014, and returned to Guizhou for the Chinese New Year the next day. He went to seek medical care, but deteriorated rapidly and died on day 8 after his illness onset. The influenza virus A/Guizhou/01502/2014 isolated from the patient had 99% identity with viruses circulating in the Yangtze River Delta region. Selected amino acids substitutions, well-known to be associated with mammalian adaptation, viral replication and drug resistance were similar to other H7N9 viruses circulating in humans. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiology investigation and laboratory results confirmed it was the first imported case of H7N9 infection in Guizhou Province. This finding further indicated that more human H7N9 cases may be detected in other regions due to frequent travel both domestically and internationally.","Wang, Dingming; Tang, Guangpeng; Huang, Yan; Yu, Chun; Li, Shijun; Zhuang, Li; Fu, Lin; Wang, Shiping; Li, Nanshi; Li, Xiyan; Yang, Lei; Lan, Yu; Bai, Tian; Shu, Yuelong",J Med Case Rep,190,0

A total of 25 cases were reported from the first wave of the epidemic until April 8, 2014. The fatality rate was much higher than in previous reports. The objective of the current work was to describe the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of A (H7N9) patients in Guangzhou and explore possible reasons for the high fatality rate. METHODS: Clinical and epidemiological information regarding A (H7N9) cases in Guangzhou was collected through review of medical records and field research. Data regarding clinical and laboratory features, treatment, and outcomes were extracted. RESULTS: Of the 25 patients, 84 % (21/25) had one or more underlying diseases. Fifteen patients (60.0 %) developed moderate to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and 14 (56 %) died of the ARDS or multiorgan failure. Patients with longer delay between onset of illness and initiation of oseltamivir treatment were more likely to develop ARDS. Elevated C-creative protein, aspartate aminotransferase, creatine kinase, and lymphocytopenia predicted a higher risk of developing ARDS. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of underlying diseases and clinical complications predicted poor clinical outcome. Early oseltamivir treatment was associated with a reduced risk of developing ARDS.","Wang, Hui; Xiao, XinCai; Lu, Jianyun; Chen, Zongqiu; Li, Kuibiao; Liu, Hui; Luo, Lei; Wang, Ming; Yang, ZhiCong",BMC Infect Dis,190,3
2479,2479,2479,Fatal varicella pneumonia in an unvaccinated child with Down Syndrome: a case report,14.881614,10.626934,2016-11-17,"BACKGROUND: Varicella is an acute infectious disease common during childhood. It has mostly an uncomplicated course in early childhood. Neverthless, it may result in severe complications, especially in particular age groups and clinical conditions. Down Syndrome represents a risk factor for developing complications, because of the frequent comorbidities and their immunodeficiency. CASE PRESENTATION: A 2-year-old white Caucasian female affected by Down Syndrome was referred to our hospital for cardiac arrest in course of varicella disease. After cardiopulmonary resuscitation and stabilization, her clinical conditions didn’t improve and she developed a massive pulmonary hemorrage, which led her to exitus. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality due to varicella infection is rare, but it is more common in subjects with immune deficit or chronic pathologies, and in particular age-groups. The importance of the vaccine for preventable infectious diseases is stressed in this paper, in which we present a case of death in an unvaccinated cardiopathic child with Down Syndrome affected by varicella.","Valentini, Diletta; Bianchi, Simona; Di Camillo, Chiara; Vittucci, Anna Chiara; Gonfiantini, Michaela Veronika; De Vito, Rita; Villani, Alberto",Ital J Pediatr,190,0
2984,2984,2984,Case report: atypical presentation of vancomycin induced DRESS syndrome: a case report and review of the literature,14.82581,10.50014,2017-12-28,"BACKGROUND: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a severe hypersensitivity drug reaction involving the skin and multiple internal organ systems. The symptoms typically present with fever and skin rash, and rapidly progress to multiple organ failures. Vancomycin is a rare drug to cause DRESS syndrome with 23 cases reported to date. CASE PRESENTATION: We described a case of a 39 year-old man who was treated with vancomycin for osteomyelitis of the foot. The patient subsequently developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) followed by rash and acute interstitial nephritis. These symptoms were improved by withdrawal of vancomycin and a pulsed corticosteroid regimen. According to the European Registry of Severe Cutaneous Adverse Reaction Criteria (RegiSCAR) (Kardaun et al, British Journal of Dermatology, 169:1071-1080, 2013), the probability of vancomycin induced DRESS syndrome was scored as “Definite”. A literature search of vancomycin induced DRESS syndrome was also performed and the overall pulmonary involvement was estimated as 5%. To our knowledge, this was the first case reported with pulmonary involvement as the initial symptom. CONCLUSION: This is the first case to report pulmonary manifestation as the initial symptom in vancomycin induced DRESS syndrome.

PATIENT CONCERNS: A 53-year-old female presented with intermittent fever, chills, and dry cough since 10 days. Chest computed tomography scan showed multiple bilateral patchy infiltrates. PPD skin test was positive but tuberculosis antibody test and T-SPOT were negative. DIAGNOSES: Histologic examination revealed massive fibrinous exudation with organization within alveolar spaces and scattered neutrophilic infiltrates, which was consistent with AFOP. INTERVENTIONS: This patient was treated with prednisolone therapy. OUTCOMES: Chest radiograph improvement and symptom improvement, including fever and respiratory symptoms, was observed after 2 week of oral prednisolone treatment. After 9-month of treatment, the patient was asymptomatic with stable disease and improved quality of life. LESSONS: AFOP has unique pathologic manifestations; however, the condition is liable to be misdiagnosed as community-acquired pneumonia ortuberculosis.

3746,3746,3746,Misdiagnosis of scrub typhus complicated by hemophagocytic syndrome,14.961305,10.599428,2019-04-10,"BACKGROUND: This study sought to analyze the cases of clinical misdiagnosis of scrub typhus complicated by hemophagocytic syndrome. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records for diagnoses, clinical course, chest X-ray findings, laboratory data, and antibiotic therapy. RESULTS: All nine patients were misdiagnosed at the outpatient department between 07/2009 and 07/2017. They were diagnosed with septicemia and hemophagocytic syndrome, sepsis and hemophagocytic syndrome, severe infection, hepatitis and hemophagocytic syndrome, or upper respiratory tract infection. Among the nine patients, hepatic function examination showed decreased albumin and elevated C-reactive protein levels in all patients; alanine aminotransferase was increased and platelets were decreased in eight patients. Weil-Felix reaction was positive in three of nine patients. Indirect immunofluorescence demonstrated positive IgM antibody and EB virus-IgM in all nine patients; Mycoplasma pneumoniae antibody was positive in seven patients. All nine patients underwent chest computed tomography; no abnormality was found in two patients. Patch shadow with increased density was found in seven patients, including four patients with right pleural effusion and two with bilateral pleural effusion. Bone marrow biopsy was performed in all nine patients and hemophagocytic cells were seen. The nine misdiagnosed cases were given multiple broad-spectrum antibiotics either successively or concomitantly before and after admission, but no effective antibiotics against Orientis tsutsugamushi were applied. After diagnosis was corrected to scrub typhus, five patients were switched to chloramphenicol and dexamethasone, two patients were given azithromycin and dexamethasone, and two patients were treated with chloramphenicol. Body temperature returned to normal within 2–3 days and the children were quickly relieved from their condition. CONCLUSION: Hemophagocytic syndrome may be the presenting clinical feature of scrub typhus and initially mask the disease. Initial misdiagnosis is common and includes septicemia and hemophagocytic syndrome. The eschar is a useful diagnostic clue and febrile patients without any localizing signs should be thoroughly examined for its presence.","Lin, Miaomiao; Huang, Airong; Zheng, Xiang; Ge, Lisha; He, Shijun",BMC Pediatr,190,1

METHODS: We retrospectively collected clinical data and outcomes of laboratory-confirmed hospitalized patients (severe to critical) during Jan-2011 to Feb-2018 from five hospitals, followed by a systematic analysis of cases from 2017 to 2018 (n = 289) and all previous epidemics during 2011–2017 (n = 169). RESULTS: In-hospital fatality was over 5-folds higher during the 2017–2018 (p < 0.01) in which 19 patients died (6.6%), whereas only 2 mortalities (1.2%) were observed during 2011–2017. Of the 289 hospitalized in 2017–2018, 153 were confirmed with influenza B virus, 110 with A/H1N1pdm09, and 26 A/H3N2, whereas A/H1N1pdm09 was the predominant cause of hospitalization in previous seasons combined (45%). Fatal cases in 2017–2018 were exclusively associated with either influenza B or A/H1N1pdm09. Our results show that a significant lower proportion of patients aged 14 or greater were treated with oseltamivir, during the 2017–2018 epidemic, and exhibited higher levels of clinical severity. CONCLUSIONS: In-hospital fatality rate might be significantly higher in the 2017–2018 season in China. A sufficient supply of oseltamivir and antiviral therapy within 48 h from onset could reduce fatality rates.

4037,4037,4037,Causes of severe pneumonia requiring hospital admission in children without HIV infection from Africa and Asia: the PERCH multi-country case-control study,14.993965,10.436471,2019-08-31,"BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is the leading cause of death among children younger than 5 years. In this study, we estimated causes of pneumonia in young African and Asian children, using novel analytical methods applied to clinical and microbiological findings. METHODS: We did a multi-site, international case-control study in nine study sites in seven countries: Bangladesh, The Gambia, Kenya, Mali, South Africa, Thailand, and Zambia. All sites enrolled in the study for 24 months. Cases were children aged 1–59 months admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia. Controls were age-group-matched children randomly selected from communities surrounding study sites. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP-OP), urine, blood, induced sputum, lung aspirate, pleural fluid, and gastric aspirates were tested with cultures, multiplex PCR, or both. Primary analyses were restricted to cases without HIV infection and with abnormal chest x-rays and to controls without HIV infection. We applied a Bayesian, partial latent class analysis to estimate probabilities of aetiological agents at the individual and population level, incorporating case and control data. FINDINGS: Between Aug 15, 2011, and Jan 30, 2014, we enrolled 4232 cases and 5119 community controls. The primary analysis group was comprised of 1769 (41·8% of 4232) cases without HIV infection and with positive chest x-rays and 5102 (99·7% of 5119) community controls without HIV infection. Wheezing was present in 555 (31·7%) of 1752 cases (range by site 10·6–97·3%). 30-day case-fatality ratio was 6·4% (114 of 1769 cases). Blood cultures were positive in 56 (3·2%) of 1749 cases, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was the most common bacteria isolated (19 [33·9%] of 56). Almost all cases (98·9%) and controls (98·0%) had at least one pathogen detected by PCR in the NP-OP specimen. The detection of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, influenza virus, S pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), H influenzae non-type b, and Pneumocystis jirovecii in NP-OP specimens was associated with case status. The aetiology analysis estimated that viruses accounted for 61·4% (95% credible interval [CrI] 57·3–65·6) of causes, whereas bacteria accounted for 27·3% (23·3–31·6) and Mycobacterium tuberculosis for 5·9% (3·9–8·3). Viruses were less common (54·5%, 95% CrI 47·4–61·5 vs 68·0%, 62·7–72·7) and bacteria more common (33·7%, 27·2–40·8 vs 22·8%, 18·3–27·6) in very severe pneumonia cases than in severe cases. RSV had the greatest aetiological fraction (31·1%, 95% CrI 28·4–34·2) of all pathogens. Human rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus A or B, human parainfluenza virus, S pneumoniae, M tuberculosis, and H influenzae each accounted for 5% or more of the aetiological distribution. We observed differences in aetiological fraction by age for Bordetella pertussis, parainfluenza types 1 and 3, parechovirus–enterovirus, P jirovecii, RSV, rhinovirus, Staphylococcus aureus, and S pneumoniae, and differences by severity for RSV, S aureus, S pneumoniae, and parainfluenza type 3. The leading ten pathogens of each site accounted for 79% or more of the site's aetiological fraction. INTERPRETATION: In our study, a small set of pathogens accounted for most cases of pneumonia requiring hospital admission. Preventing and treating a subset of pathogens could substantially affect childhood pneumonia outcomes. FUNDING: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",,Lancet,190,1
4135,4135,4135,Multicentric experience with interferon gamma therapy in sepsis induced immunosuppression. A case series,14.814139,10.827493,2019-11-05,"BACKGROUND: The sepsis-induced immunodepression contributes to impaired clinical outcomes of various stress conditions. This syndrome is well documented and characterized by attenuated function of innate and adaptive immune cells. Several pharmacological interventions aimed to restore the immune response are emerging of which interferon-gamma (IFNγ) is one. It is of paramount relevance to obtain clinical information on optimal timing of the IFNγ-treatment, −tolerance, −effectiveness and outcome before performing a RCT. We describe the effects of IFNγ in a cohort of 18 adult and 2 pediatric sepsis patients. METHODS: In this open-label prospective multi-center case-series, IFNγ treatment was initiated in patients selected on clinical and immunological criteria early (< 4 days) or late (> 7 days) following the onset of sepsis. The data collected in 18 adults and 2 liver transplanted pediatric patients were: clinical scores, monocyte expression of HLA-DR (flow cytometry), lymphocyte immune-phenotyping (flow cytometry), IL-6 and IL-10 plasma levels (ELISA), bacterial cultures, disease severity, and mortality. RESULTS: In 15 out of 18 patients IFNγ treatment was associated with an increase of median HLA-DR expression from 2666 [IQ 1547; 4991] to 12,451 [IQ 4166; 19,707], while the absolute number of lymphocyte subpopulations were not affected, except for the decrease number of NK cells 94.5 [23; 136] to 32.5 [13; 90.8] (0.0625)]. Plasma levels of IL-6 464 [201–770] to 108 (89–140) ng/mL (p = 0.04) and IL-10 from IL-10 from 29 [12–59] to 9 [1–15] pg/mL decreased significantly. Three patients who received IFNγ early after ICU admission (<4 days) died. The other patients had a rapid clinical improvement assessed by the SOFA score and bacterial cultures that were repeatedly positive became negative. The 2 pediatric cases improved rapidly, but 1 died for hemorrhagic complication. CONCLUSION: Guided by clinical and immunological monitoring, adjunctive immunotherapy with IFNγ appears well-tolerated in our cases and improves immune host defense in sepsis induced immuno suppression. Randomized clinical studies to assess its potential clinical benefit are warranted.","Payen, Didier; Faivre, Valerie; Miatello, Jordi; Leentjens, Jenneke; Brumpt, Caren; Tissières, Pierre; Dupuis, Claire; Pickkers, Peter; Lukaszewicz, Anne Claire",BMC Infect Dis,190,3

The incidence of CR-BSI among neonates in Hung Vuong Hospital was higher than that of other neonatal care centres in Vietnam. METHODS: An 18-month pre- and post-intervention study was conducted over three 6-month periods to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention for CR-BSI and to identify risk factors associated with CR-BSI. During the intervention period, we trained all nurses in the Department of Neonatology on BSI preventive practices, provided auditing and feedback about aseptic technique during catheter care and maintenance, and reorganised preparation of total parenteral nutrition. All neonates with intravenous catheter insertion ≥48 h in the pre- and post-intervention period were enrolled. A standardised questionnaire was used to collect data. Blood samples were collected for cultures. We used Poisson regression to calculate rate ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for CR-BSI incidence rates and logistic regression to identify risk factors associated with CR-BSI. RESULTS: Of 2225 neonates enrolled, 1027 were enrolled in the pre-intervention period, of which 53 CR-BSI cases occurred in 8399 catheter-days, and 1198 were enrolled in the post-intervention period, of which 32 CR-BSI cases occurred in 8324 catheter-days. Incidence rates of CR-BSI significantly decreased after the intervention (RR = 0.61, 95% CI 0.39–0.94). Days of hospitalisation, episodes of non-catheter–related hospital-acquired infections, and the proportion of deaths significantly decreased after the intervention (p < 0.01). The CR-BSI was associated with days of intravenous catheter (odds ratio [OR] = 1.05, 95% CI 1.03–1.08), use of endotracheal intubation (OR = 2.27, 95% CI 1.27–4.06), and intravenous injection (OR = 8.50, 95% CI 1.14–63.4). CONCLUSIONS: The interventions significantly decreased the incidence rate of CR-BSI. Regular refresher training and auditing and feedback about aseptic technique during care and maintenance of catheters are critical to reducing CR-BSI.","Phan, Hang Thi; Vo, Thuan Huu; Tran, Hang Thi Thuy; Huynh, Hanh Thi Ngoc; Nguyen, Hong Thi Thu; Van Nguyen, Truong",Antimicrob Resist Infect Control,190,1

METHODS: Our analysis was based on 2006 adult patients admitted to 54 ICUs between 2014 and 2018, enrolled in the CENTER-TBI study. Indicator scores were calculated as percentage adherence for structure and process indicators and as event rates or median scores for outcome indicators. Feasibility was quantified by the completeness of the variables. Discriminability was determined by the between-centre variation, estimated with a random effect regression model adjusted for case-mix severity and quantified by the median odds ratio (MOR). Statistical uncertainty of outcome indicators was determined by the median number of events per centre, using a cut-off of 10. RESULTS: A total of 26/42 indicators could be calculated from the CENTER-TBI database. Most quality indicators proved feasible to obtain with more than 70% completeness. Sub-optimal adherence was found for most quality indicators, ranging from 26 to 93% and 20 to 99% for structure and process indicators. Significant (p < 0.001) between-centre variation was found in seven process and five outcome indicators with MORs ranging from 1.51 to 4.14. Statistical uncertainty of outcome indicators was generally high; five out of seven had less than 10 events per centre. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, nine structures, five processes, but none of the outcome indicators showed potential for quality improvement purposes for TBI patients in the ICU. Future research should focus on implementation efforts and continuous reevaluation of quality indicators.

METHODS: Seven areas of donor management were considered for this review: hemodynamic management; fluids and electrolytes; respiratory management; endocrine management; temperature management; anaemia and coagulation; infection management. For each subchapter, a narrative review was conducted. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Most elements in the current recommendations and guidelines are based on pathophysiological reasoning, epidemiological observations, or extrapolations from general ICU management strategies, and not on evidence from randomized controlled trials. The cardiorespiratory management of brain-dead donors is very similar to the management of critically ill patients, and the same applies to the management of anaemia and coagulation. Central diabetes insipidus is of particular concern, and should be diagnosed based on clinical criteria. Depending on the degree of vasopressor dependency, it can be treated with intermittent desmopressin or continuous vasopressin, intravenously. Temperature management of the donor is an area of uncertainty, but it appears reasonable to strive for a core temperature of > 35 °C. The indications and controversies regarding endocrine therapies, in particular thyroid hormone replacement therapy, and corticosteroid therapy, are discussed. The potential donor should be assessed clinically for infections, and screening tests for specific infections are an essential part of donor management. Although the rate of infection transmission from donor to receptor is low, certain infections are still a formal contraindication to organ donation. However, new antiviral drugs and strategies now allow organ donation from certain infected donors to be done safely.","Meyfroidt, Geert; Gunst, Jan; Martin-Loeches, Ignacio; Smith, Martin; Robba, Chiara; Taccone, Fabio Silvio; Citerio, Giuseppe",Intensive Care Med,190,1

One of its major ligands, IGF2, is critical for long-term memory formation and strengthening. Using CIM6P/IGF2R inhibition in rats and neuron-specific knockdown in mice, here we show that hippocampal CIM6P/IGF2R is necessary for hippocampus-dependent memory consolidation, but dispensable for learning, memory retrieval, and reconsolidation. CIM6P/IGF2R controls the training-induced upregulation of de novo protein synthesis, including increase of Arc, Egr1, and c-Fos proteins, without affecting their mRNA induction. Hippocampal or systemic administration of mannose-6-phosphate, like IGF2, significantly enhances memory retention and persistence in a CIM6P/IGF2R-dependent manner. Thus, hippocampal CIM6P/IGF2R plays a critical role in memory consolidation by controlling the rate of training-regulated protein metabolism and is also a target mechanism for memory enhancement.","Yu, Xiao-Wen; Pandey, Kiran; Katzman, Aaron C; Alberini, Cristina M",,190,16

Most, but not all, isolates collected from Brassica plants in China infected only Brassica plants, whereas those from Japan infected both Brassica and Raphanus (BR) plants. Analyses of the positions of recombination sites in five regions of the genomes (one third of the full sequence) of the many recombinant isolates were fully congruent with the results of phylogenetic analysis, and at least one recombination type pattern was shared between Chinese and Japanese populations. One lineage of nonrecombinant isolates from the basal‐BR lineage was found in 2000 in Kyushu, Japan but none in China, and have since been found over the whole island. The sudden expansion of this basal‐BR population was strongly supported by calculations showing the deviations from the neutral equilibrium model for the individual geographical lineages with overall lack of nucleotide diversity, and by analysis of mismatch distribution.

Due to the medical importance of D. marginatus, control measures are needed for this tick species. Currently tick control approaches rely mostly on acaricide application, whereas wrong and irrational acaricide use may result in drug resistance and residue problems. Vaccination as an alternative approach for tick control has been proven to be effective towards some tick species. However, immunization against D. marginatus has not yet reached satisfactory protection. The effort of in silico based analysis could predict antigenicity and identify candidates for anti-tick vaccine development. We carried out an in silico analysis of D. marginatus glutathione S-transferases (DmGSTs) in order to identify blood-feeding induced GSTs as antigens that can be used in anti-tick vaccine development. Phylogenetic analysis, linear B-cell epitope prediction, homology modeling, and conformational B-cell epitope mapping on the GST models were performed to identify highly antigenic DmGSTs. Relative gene expressions of the seven GSTs were profiled through real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to outline GSTs up-regulated during blood feeding. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the seven GSTs belonged to four classes of GST, including one in epsilon-class, one in zeta-class, one in omega-class, and four in mu-class. Linear B-cell epitope prediction revealed mu-class GSTs share similar conserved antigenic regions. The conformational B-cell epitope mapped on the homology model of the GSTs displayed that GSTs of mu-class showed stronger antigenicity than that of other classes. RT-qPCR revealed DmGSTM1 and DmGSTM2 were positively related to blood feeding. In sum, the data suggest that DmGSTM1 and DmGSTM2 could be tested for potential anti-tick vaccine trials.

Previous priming with avian influenza vaccines results in more rapid and more robust neutralizing antibody responses upon revaccination, but the role CD4(+) T cells play in this process is not currently known. Methods. Human subjects previously enrolled in trials of inactivated influenza A(H5N1) vaccines and naive subjects were immunized with an inactivated subunit influenza A/Indonesia/5/05(H5N1) vaccine. Neutralizing antibody responses were measured by a microneutralization assay, and hemagglutinin (HA)-specific and nucleoprotein (NP)-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses were quantified using interferon γ enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assays. Results. While vaccination induced barely detectable CD4(+) T-cell responses specific for HA in the previously unprimed group, primed subjects had readily detectable HA-specific memory CD4(+) T cells at baseline and mounted a more robust response to HA-specific epitopes after vaccination. There were no differences between groups when conserved NP-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses were examined. Interestingly, neutralizing antibody responses following revaccination were significantly higher in individuals who mounted a CD4(+) T-cell response to the H5 HA protein, a correlation not observed for NP-specific responses. Conclusions. These findings suggest that prepandemic vaccination results in an enriched population of HA-specific CD4(+) T cells that are recruited on rechallenge with a drifted vaccine variant and contribute to more robust and more rapid neutralizing antibody responses.","Nayak, Jennifer L.; Richards, Katherine A.; Yang, Hongmei; Treanor, John J.; Sant, Andrea J.",J Infect Dis,190,3

The current study aimed to develop a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay to detect pathogenic Vibrio parahaemolyticus, important foodborne pathogen, targeting tdh, and trh genes. The specificity of the LAMP assay was good without any false-positive and false-negative results. The assay was highly sensitive and could detect the pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus as low as 1 CFU/reaction in spiked seafood samples and 1 pg of extracted DNA. Out of 62 seafood samples from India’s southwest coastal region tested with LAMP assay, eight (12.9%) were positive for trh, and seven (11.29%) samples were positive tdh gene. LAMP-based on tdh and trh was found to be significantly more sensitive (p < 0.05) than conventional PCR and nearly equal sensitive as real-time PCR (RT-PCR) for the detection of pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus. Our study shows that LAMP assay can be a better approach as a point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tool and could detect pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus on seafood samples directly without enrichment and isolation. The high sensitivity and simplicity make LAMP assay a better alternative method than the conventional method and RT-PCR for the detection of pathogens. LAMP assay can be considered as a good alternative to PCR for the routine detection of pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus in seafood.

Experiment 1 tested whether dogs would behave differently in the presence of an accurate (vs. inaccurate) informant. Dogs followed an accurate informant’s point significantly above chance. Further, when presented with an inaccurate point, dogs were more likely to ignore it and choose the correct location. Experiment 2 tested whether dogs could use informant past accuracy to selectively follow the point of the previously accurate informant. In test trials when informants simultaneously pointed at different locations (only one of which contained a treat), dogs chose the accurate informant at chance levels. Experiment 3 controlled for non-social task demands (e.g. understanding of hidden baiting and occlusion events) that may have influenced Experiment 2 performance.

Inflammatory infiltration in the stellate ganglion (SG) is a critical factor for cardiac sympathoexcitation in patients with ventricular arrhythmias. This study aims to investigate if macrophage depletion in SGs decreases cardiac sympathetic overactivation and ventricular arrhythmogenesis in CHF. Surgical ligation of the coronary artery was used for induction of CHF. Clodronate liposomes were microinjected into bilateral SGs of CHF rats for macrophage depletion. Using cytokine array, immunofluorescence staining, and Western blot analysis, we found that macrophage expansion and expression of TNFα and IL-1β in SGs were markedly increased in CHF rats. Flow cytometry data confirmed that the percentage of macrophages in SGs was higher in CHF rats than that in sham rats. Clodronate liposomes significantly reduced CHF-elevated proinflammatory cytokine levels and macrophage expansion in SGs. Clodronate liposomes also reduced CHF-increased N-type Ca(2+) currents and excitability of cardiac sympathetic postganglionic neurons and inhibited CHF-enhanced cardiac sympathetic nerve activity. ECG data from 24-h, continuous telemetry recording in conscious rats demonstrated that clodronate liposomes not only restored CHF-induced heterogeneity of ventricular electrical activities, but also decreased the incidence and duration of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation in CHF. Macrophage depletion with clodronate liposomes attenuated CHF-induced cardiac sympathetic overactivation and ventricular arrhythmias through reduction of macrophage expansion and neuroinflammation in SGs.

However, its active ingredients and combined action mechanism have not been fully elucidated so far. The purpose of this study was to screen the effective ingredients and targets and elucidate the synergistic action mechanism of SGM in asthma mice using the network pharmacological approach. METHODS: A mouse model of asthma model was used in this study. Mice were orally administered SGM at three doses for 4 weeks and the effect of SGM on asthma was evaluated. The active ingredients and their targets of SGM were identiﬁed by searching databases, such as Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database (TCMSP). The main active ingredients were selected with parameters OB and DL. The synergistic action mechanisms of SGM in asthma were studied through key active ingredient-target interaction network and verified using surface plasmon resonance assay (SPR). RESULTS: SGM exerts anti-asthmatic effects by reducing lung tissue damage and inflammatory factors (IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) in asthmatic mice. Twenty ingredients and 45 related proteins were selected as potential nodes using enrichment analysis and network analysis. Inflammation and smooth muscle regulation-related pathways were considered to be the main pharmacological mechanisms of SGM in the treatment of asthma. Especially, 5 molecule-target pairs (including 3 ingredients and 4 proteins) were well docked with each other and the SPR assay revealed that glabridin-PTGS2 had good binding with 44.5 μM Kd value. CONCLUSION: SGM exerts the synergistic anti-asthma effects by virtue of reducing lung-tissue damage and inflammatory factors in asthmatic mice, which explains the theoretical basis for the traditional Chinese medicine, SGM, to treat asthma. Our study thus sheds light on a variety of options including Chinese medicine that could potentially be used in the clinical treatment of asthma.","Ye, Qing; Zhang, Qiqiang; Yao, Huijuan; Xu, Ajing; Liu, Yan; Qi, Jia; Zhang, Hai; Zhang, Jian",Drug Des Devel Ther,190,0

These particles or their interactions with other toxic matter circulate in humans via the food chain or air. Whether these micro- and nanoparticles interfere with extracellular vesicles (EVs) due to their similar sizes is unclear. Micro- and nanoparticles (MSs and NSs) induce several cell responses and are engulfed by cells depending on their size, for example, particulate matter with a diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5). Autophagy is a mechanism by which pathogens are destroyed in cells. Some artificial materials are not easily decomposed in organisms. How do these cells or tissues respond? In addition, autophagy operates through two pathways (increasing cell death or cell survival) in tumorigenesis. Many MSs and NSs have been found that induce autophagy in various cells and tissues. As a result, this review focuses on how these particles interfere with cells and tissues. Here, we review MSs, NSs, and PM2.5, which result in different autophagy-related responses in various tissues or cells.","Wang, Yung-Li; Zheng, Cai-Mei; Lee, Yu-Hsuan; Cheng, Ya-Yun; Lin, Yuh-Feng; Chiu, Hui-Wen",Int J Mol Sci,190,0

Such goal is achieved via hematopoiesis occurring within the bone marrow (BM) under the tight regulation of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) homeostasis made by the BM microenvironment. The BM niche is defined by the close interactions of HSPCs and non-hematopoietic cells of different origin, which control the maintenance of HSPCs and orchestrate hematopoiesis in response to the body’s requirements. The activity of the BM niche is regulated by specific signaling pathways in physiological conditions and in case of stress, including the one induced by the HSPC transplantation (HSCT) procedures. HSCT is the curative option for several hematological and non-hematological diseases, despite being associated with early and late complications, mainly due to a low level of HSPC engraftment, impaired hematopoietic recovery, immune-mediated graft rejection, and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) in case of allogenic transplant. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are key elements of the BM niche, regulating HSPC homeostasis by direct contact and secreting several paracrine factors. In this review, we will explore the several mechanisms through which MSCs impact on the supportive activity of the BM niche and regulate HSPC homeostasis. We will further discuss how the growing understanding of such mechanisms have impacted, under a clinical point of view, on the transplantation field. In more recent years, these results have instructed the design of clinical trials to ameliorate the outcome of HSCT, especially in the allogenic setting, and when low doses of HSPCs were available for transplantation.","Crippa, Stefania; Santi, Ludovica; Berti, Margherita; De Ponti, Giada; Bernardo, Maria Ester",Front Cell Dev Biol,190,0

It is well described that it has low toxicity among animals and is lethal if consumed in large amounts. However, toxicity in humans is rarely reported in literature. Here, we describe acetamiprid toxicity complicated with severe lactic acidosis, myocardial ischemia, refractory hypotension, and severe hypokalemia in a middle-aged man who presented with deliberate self-harming with acetamiprid poisoning in Sri Lanka. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe a case of acute poisoning with an acetamiprid in a middle-aged Sri Lankan Tamil farmer for suicidal purposes following family conflicts with his wife. He presented with severe nausea, vomiting, and altered level of consciousness. He had electrocardiogram changes, hypoxia, and lactic acidosis. With intensive care management including ventilatory support, inotropic therapy along with intraarterial blood pressure monitoring, correction of acidosis, and administration of electrolytes, he made good clinical recovery. He was discharged without any further complications 6 days after ingestion of acetamiprid. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates a rare, acute poisoning with acetamiprid in human, as well as its clinical manifestations and successful management with supportive therapy. This will be helpful for clinicians to identify clinical manifestations and to guide management of acute poisoning with acetamiprid in the future.","Pirasath, Selladurai; Senthuran, Rajaram; Athirayan, Chandrakulasegeran; Gevakaran, Mathyasekeran; Guruparan, Mahesan; Gnanathasan, Ariaranee",J Med Case Rep,190,0

Regional variations in retinal blood flow and modulation of retinal capillary width in the macular area and the retinal environment are also linked to the course of diabetic retinopathy. Despite the fact that diabetic retinopathy is frequent nowadays, it is hard to avoid. An ophthalmologist generally determines the seriousness of the retinopathy of the eye by directly examining color photos and evaluating them by visually inspecting the fundus. It is an expensive process because of the vast number of diabetic patients around the globe. We used the IDRiD data set that contains both typical diabetic retinopathic lesions and normal retinal structures. We provided a CNN architecture for the detection of the target region of 80 patients' fundus imagery. Results demonstrate that the approach described here can nearly detect 83.84% of target locations.

Among nosocomial pneumonia subtypes, ventilated HABP (vHABP) is associated with the lowest survival. In the ASPECT-NP randomized, controlled trial, participants with vHABP treated with ceftolozane/tazobactam had lower 28-day all-cause mortality (ACM) than those receiving meropenem. We conducted a series of post hoc analyses to explore the clinical significance of this finding. METHODS: ASPECT-NP was a multinational, phase 3, noninferiority trial comparing ceftolozane/tazobactam with meropenem for treating vHABP and VABP; study design, efficacy, and safety results have been reported previously. The primary endpoint was 28-day ACM. The key secondary endpoint was clinical response at test-of-cure. Participants with vHABP were a prospectively defined subgroup, but subgroup analyses were not powered for noninferiority testing. We compared baseline and treatment factors, efficacy, and safety between ceftolozane/tazobactam and meropenem in participants with vHABP. We also conducted a retrospective multivariable logistic regression analysis in this subgroup to determine the impact of treatment arm on mortality when adjusted for significant prognostic factors. RESULTS: Overall, 99 participants in the ceftolozane/tazobactam and 108 in the meropenem arm had vHABP. 28-day ACM was 24.2% and 37.0%, respectively, in the intention-to-treat population (95% confidence interval [CI] for difference: 0.2, 24.8) and 18.2% and 36.6%, respectively, in the microbiologic intention-to-treat population (95% CI 2.5, 32.5). Clinical cure rates in the intention-to-treat population were 50.5% and 44.4%, respectively (95% CI − 7.4, 19.3). Baseline clinical, baseline microbiologic, and treatment factors were comparable between treatment arms. Multivariable regression identified concomitant vasopressor use and baseline bacteremia as significantly impacting ACM in ASPECT-NP; adjusting for these two factors, the odds of dying by day 28 were 2.3-fold greater when participants received meropenem instead of ceftolozane/tazobactam. CONCLUSIONS: There were no underlying differences between treatment arms expected to have biased the observed survival advantage with ceftolozane/tazobactam in the vHABP subgroup. After adjusting for clinically relevant factors found to impact ACM significantly in this trial, the mortality risk in participants with vHABP was over twice as high when treated with meropenem compared with ceftolozane/tazobactam.

Exosomes are rich in a variety of biologically active substances, such as proteins, nucleotides, and lipids. Exosomes are widely present in various body fluids and cell culture supernatants, and it mediates the physiological and pathological processes of the body through the shuttle of these active ingredients to target cells. In recent years, studies have shown that exosomes from a variety of cell sources can play a beneficial role in acute and chronic kidney disease. In particular, exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells have significant curative effects on the prevention and treatment of kidney disease in preclinical trials. Besides, some encapsulated substances are demonstrated to exert beneficial effects on various diseases, so they have attracted much attention. In addition, exosomes have extensive sources, stable biological activity, and good biocompatibility and are easy to store and transport; these advantages endow exosomes with superior diagnostic value. With the rapid development of liquid biopsy technology related to exosomes, the application of exosomes in the rapid diagnosis of kidney disease has become more prominent. In this review, the latest development of exosomes, including the biosynthesis process, the isolation and identification methods of exosomes are systematically summarized. The utilization of exosomes in diagnosis and their positive effects in the repair of kidney dysfunction are discussed, along with the specific mechanisms. This review is expected to be helpful for relevant studies and to provide insight into future applications in clinical practice.","Jin, Can; Wu, Peipei; Li, Linli; Xu, Wenrong; Qian, Hui",Stem Cells Int,190,1

METHODS: Clinical Practice Research Datalink data from England for 150,921 adults aged ≥40 were used to identify participants with features of possible cancer equating to risk thresholds ≥1%, ≥2% or ≥3% for breast, lung, colorectal, oesophago-gastric, pancreatic, renal, bladder, prostatic, ovarian, endometrial and laryngeal cancers. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 60 (SD 13) years, with 73,643 males (49%). In 2016, 8576 consultation records contained coded features having a positive predictive value (PPV) of ≥3% for any of the 11 cancers. This equates to a rate of 5682/100,000 patients compared with 4601/100,000 Suspected Cancer NHS referrals for these cancers from April 2016–March 2017. Nine thousands two hundred ninety-one patient-consultation records had coded features equating to a ≥2% PPV, 8% more than met PPV ≥ 3%. Similarly, 19,517 had features with a PPV ≥ 1%, 136% higher than for PPV ≥ 3%. CONCLUSIONS: This study estimated the number of primary-care patients presenting at lower thresholds of cancer risk. The resource implications of liberalising this threshold to 2% are modest and manageable.

METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study that recruited 601 women with PCOS from January 2018 to January 2021. PCOS was diagnosed according to the Rotterdam definition. Hyperuricemia was defined as serum uric acid level of at least 357 μmol/L. RESULTS: PCOS females with hyperuricemia had significantly greater values of NC, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference (HC). NC was positively associated with serum uric acid levels, with a standardized regression coefficient of 0.34 after adjusting for confounding factors. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis showed that NC was significantly associated with an increased risk of hyperuricemia, with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.36. The associations between NC and serum uric acid levels were more considerable in those with medium/high BMI (BMI ≥ 21.63 kg/m(2)), all ranges of WC or medium/high HC (HC ≥ 90 cm). The optimal cut-off point of NC in predicting hyperuricemia was 32.0 cm (Youden index = 0.48), with the sensitivity and negative predictive value of 84.81% and 92.08%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: NC was positively correlated with serum uric acid levels and the prevalence of hyperuricemia in women with PCOS. Therefore, we suggest NC as a simple, novel, and reliable anthropometric measure to be used in the routine clinical assessment of women with PCOS to screen those at high risk of hyperuricemia.","Yang, Haiyan; Liu, Chang; Jin, Congcong; Yu, Rong; Ding, Lin; Mu, Liangshan",Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),190,1

Lupus anticoagulant (LA), anticardiolipin (aCL), and anti-beta2 glycoprotein I (β(2)GPI) assays are the formal laboratory classification/diagnostic criteria. Additional nonclassification assays have been suggested; among them, antiphosphatidylserine-prothrombin (aPS/PT) and antidomain 1 β(2)GPI antibodies are the most promising ones although not yet formally accepted. aPL represent the example of a laboratory test that moved from dichotomous to quantitative results consistent with the idea that reporting quantitative data offers more diagnostic/prognostic information for both vascular and obstetric manifestations. Although the general rule is that the higher the aPL titer, the higher the test likelihood ratio, there is growing evidence that this is not the case for persistent low titers and obstetric events. LA displays the highest diagnostic/prognostic power, although some isolated LAs are apparently not associated with APS manifestations. Moreover, isotype characterization is also critical since IgG aPL are more diagnostic/prognostic than IgA or IgM. aPL are directed against two main autoantigens: β(2)GPI and PT. However, anti-β(2)GPI antibodies are more associated with the APS clinical spectrum. In addition, there is evidence that anti-β(2)GPI domain 1 antibodies display a stronger diagnostic/prognostic value. This finding supports the view that antigen and even epitope characterization represents a further step for improving the assay value. The strategy to improve aPL laboratory characterization is a lesson that can be translated to other autoantibody assays in order to improve our diagnostic and prognostic power.","Meroni, Pier Luigi; Borghi, Maria Orietta",Front Immunol,190,3

27142,27142,27142,ABSTRACT BOOK,14.936355,10.630181,2010-02-19,"INTRODUCTION: Hematologic malignancies (HM) are often highly aggressive processes requiring multi-chemotherapy regimens and potentially hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for treatment. Totally implantable venous access ports (TIVAP) are the standard access for administration of these regimens. The regimens usually involve periods of neutropenia for which infection can increase morbidity and require removal of the port. Although deemed safe for use in cancer populations, many studies have only looked at patients with TIVAP in solid tumor malignancies. Herein, we report our single institution experience identifying modulators for infection related to TIVAP in this high-risk population. OBJECTIVES: To identify risk factors for port infection in HM patients. METHODS: We performed an IRB-approved single institution retrospective review of HM patients who had a TIVAP removed for port infection versus completion of therapy. Medical records were evaluated for patient demographics and tumor type, details of previous therapy regimens such as chemotherapy and HSCT status, laboratory values including albumin, white blood cell, neutrophil and platelet counts, as well as characteristics of the TIVAP. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed between the two cohorts to identify clinical predictors of port infection necessitating TIVAP removal. RESULTS: Between March 2015 and July 2018, 104 TIVAPs were removed from HM patients, 34 (33%) for infection and 70 (67%) for completion of treatment. Median patient age was 60 years (range 22-86) and there was an even number of men and women (n=52). Most TIVAPs were double lumen (n=98, 94%) and placed in the right IJV (n=100, 96%). The median number of port days was 49 in the infection group and 414 in the completion group, with removal of 12 (35%) of the infected ports within 30 days. Multiple factors were significant predictors of port infection on univariate analysis, including diagnosis of AML or ALL (p=0.0019), no prior HSCT (p=0.0148), neutropenia within 30 days of removal (p<0.0001), ANC <1500 (p <0.0001), leukopenia the day prior to removal (p<0.0001), thrombocytopenia (p <0.0001), and hypoalbuminemia (p<0.0001). Steroid use, leukopenia or leukocytosis the day of placement, and leukocytosis the day prior to removal were not significantly different between the two groups. On multivariate analysis, no prior HSCT (OR=48.08, 95% CI 2.64-875.63, p=0.009), neutropenia within 30 days of removal (OR=67.60, 95% CI 1.68-2726.66, p=0.026), and hypoalbuminemia (OR=405.52, 95% CI 15.64-10517.89, p<0.0001) remained significant. CONCLUSION: In patients with HM, significant predictors of port infection requiring TIVAP removal included neutropenia within 30 days of removal and hypoalbuminemia. Interestingly, patients who underwent HSCT were less likely to a develop a port infection requiring TIVAP removal.","Peterson, Shawn Lanham; Priddy, Erin; Dong, Brian Yang; Ghazi, Cameron Alexander; Dinglasan, Lu Anne Velayo",Biol Blood Marrow Transplant,190,1

A total of 35 species of chydorids was recovered; 3 species were new for Denmark, while 3 others previously reported from Danish lakes were not found. The lakes sampled were subjectively grouped according to physical—chemical measurements into 1 of 3 groups–clear—water lakes (1), ponds and bogs (2) and polluted, clear—water lakes (3). Correlations between chydorids and chemical—physical properties of lakes, plus evidence from relative abundances and frequencies of each species found in each lake type, suggests that most species prefer those waters best termed oligotrophic and dystrophic. The exceptions of Chydorus sphaericus and Alona rectangula which, when found in high percentages, typify eutrophic or polluted sites. These data correlated well with species diversity values–high values were found in clear—water lakes (1) and ponds and bogs (2), while low diversities were typical of polluted sites (3). These data suggested that species diversity is a function of available habitat (rooted aquatics), and hence to a large extent the distribution of most chydorid species within a region is determined by habitat diversity (structure). Grane Langso (an oligotrophic, Jutlandic lake) and Esrom S° (an eutrophic, Zealandic lake) were selected for paleo—studies because of their differences, which resulted in contrasting lake development. Postglacial gyttja sediment in Grane Langso extended to 431 cm below the mud—water surface interface. Pollen zonation, and a radiocarbon date of ±9500 BP placed the lowest organic deposits into Pre—Boreal time. Two chydorid species were important in Grane Langso Late—glacial sands underlying the gyttja (Alona affinis and Chydorus sphaericus). Chydorid faunas developed through the Pre—Boreal and early Boreal; by late Boreal chydorid populations were most diverse, and presumably stable. A decrease in species diversity during Atlantic time was due to unstable conditions within the lake, evidenced by deposition of sand; Chydorus piger was abundant during this period. Sub—Boreal organic deposits overlay the Atlantic sands. High percentages of Pleuroxus during mid—Sub—Boreal were attributed to man's activity, and a lower water level. The most recent change in chydorid assemblages occurred within the past 100 yrs; this change was increased percentages of Alonella nana–a species normally associated with low alkalinities in Denmark. Postglacial calcareous gyttja deposits in Esrom So extended to 380 cm below the mud water interface. Calcareous clay extended from 381—840 cm, and glacial till occurred below 840 cm. Pollen preservation was poor in Esrom, but the lowermost gyttja was probably Pre—Boreal (Zone IV). No pollen counts were attributable to Zone VI. Few chydorid remains were found in Late—glacial clays, and extensive development of populations began in Pre—Boreal time (370 cm). Chydorid assemblages characteristic of discriminant Group 1 were present throughout most of the postglacial deposits; benthic species were prevalent during most of the lake's history. Littoral forms did increase in Sub—Boreal time, but by Sub—Atlantic chydorid assemblages were again dominated by benthic groups.

But, as per the current trend, about 15% of the cases require hospitalization and less than 5% cases are critical. Due to the massive number of COVID-19 cases all over the world, the ventilator requirement is increasing, and these traditional ventilators are quite expensive and are occupied for the critical cases, thus available in limited numbers. In this regard, BiPAP (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) ventilation support can be used for the less critical cases where patients do not require intubation by specialized staff and also minimizing the risk of infection during the procedure. The current article aims to deliver a design of an inexpensive BiPAP with an infection-free exhaust. BiPAP is a mode of ventilation which maintains positive pressure for air intake, and a low or zero pressure is created for expiration. The BiPAP suggested in the current article uses an air blower connected to an Arduino via a speed controller, the level of pressure and breathing rate are programmed in the Arduino, thus, the blower functions in BiPAP mode. The 3D printed mask proposed here comprises of a unique design for the intake and exhalation of air; and comprises of two sizes to fit all adults while avoiding any leakage. The design suggested is further tweaked for emergency use to support up to four patients using a single BiPAP. The mass production of the same would cost approx. INR 6500 or 85 USD.","Singh, Gaurav Pal; Sardana, Neha",Trans Indian Natl,190,0

Most ITPs support such extensions in the form of restrictive “syntax sugar” substitutions and other ad hoc mechanisms, which are too rudimentary to support many desirable abstractions. As a result, libraries are littered with unnecessary redundancy. Tactic languages in these systems are plagued by a seemingly unrelated issue: accidental name capture, which often produces unexpected and counterintuitive behavior. We take ideas from the Scheme family of programming languages and solve these two problems simultaneously by proposing a novel hygienic macro system custom-built for ITPs. We further describe how our approach can be extended to cover type-directed macro expansion resulting in a single, uniform system offering multiple abstraction levels that range from supporting simplest syntax sugars to elaboration of formerly baked-in syntax. We have implemented our new macro system and integrated it into the upcoming version (v4) of the Lean theorem prover. Despite its expressivity, the macro system is simple enough that it can easily be integrated into other systems.

First, a hierarchical view displays a tree-structure of discourse as a visual illustration of CNA links within a document. Second, a grid view available at paragraph or sentence levels displays links both within and between documents, thus ensuring ease of visualization for links spanning across multiple documents.

Stochastic games are standard models in control, verification, and synthesis of stochastic reactive systems that exhibit both randomness as well as angelic and demonic non-determinism. Lexicographic order allows to consider multiple objectives with a strict preference order over the satisfaction of the objectives. To the best of our knowledge, stochastic games with lexicographic objectives have not been studied before. We establish determinacy of such games and present strategy and computational complexity results. For strategy complexity, we show that lexicographically optimal strategies exist that are deterministic and memory is only required to remember the already satisfied and violated objectives. For a constant number of objectives, we show that the relevant decision problem is in [Formula: see text], matching the current known bound for single objectives; and in general the decision problem is [Formula: see text]-hard and can be solved in [Formula: see text]. We present an algorithm that computes the lexicographically optimal strategies via a reduction to computation of optimal strategies in a sequence of single-objectives games.

The burden of these visits is multiplied in pandemics and times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, during which ED resources may already be overwhelmed. Post-operative Emergency Department (ED) visits following suboccipital decompression in CM-1 patients are not well described. METHODS: A prospectively maintained database of CM-1 patients seen at our institution between January 1, 2006 and December 31, 2019 was used. Pre-operatively and post-operatively prior to hospital discharge, patients are counselled extensively on activity restrictions after surgery, incision care, expectations of severe headache and neck stiffness for the first few weeks after surgery, the variability in degree and timing of symptom improvement from patient to patient, and the proper intake of analgesics, as prescribed. ED visits occurring within 30 days after surgery were tracked for postoperative patients, while comparing clinical, imaging, and operative characteristics between patients with and without an ED visit. Clinical improvement at last follow-up was compared between both groups of patients in a univariable and multivariable analysis using the Chicago Chiari Outcome Scale (CCOS). RESULTS: In 175 surgically treated patients, 44 (25%) visited an ED in the 1-month period after surgery. The most common reason for seeking care was isolated headache (41%). Concentration disturbance at presentation was the only factor significantly associated with a post-operative ED visit (P = .023). The occurrence of a post-operative ED visit was independently associated with a lower chance of clinical improvement at last follow-up (adjusted OR of CCOS≥13 = 0.35, P = .021; adjusted OR of CCOS≥14 = 0.38, P = .016). CONCLUSION: Adult CM-1 patients undergoing surgery at a tertiary referral center have an elevated rate of post-operative ED visits, which are mostly due to pain-related complaints, despite preoperative and postoperative counselling. Such visits are hard to predict but are associated with worse long-term clinical outcome. Interventions that decrease the magnitude of post-operative ED service utilization are warranted.","Feghali, James; Marinaro, Elizabeth; Xie, Yangyiran; Chen, Yuxi; Li, Sean; Huang, Judy",Neurosurgery,190,1

The one-step RT-PSR was accomplished at the optimal temperature of 62°C and time of 40 min and used primers simply designed as conventional PCR primers, and the results of detection were visible to the naked eye. The detection limit of PSR was above 34.7 copies/μL at a 95% probability level according to probit regression analysis. The assay specifically detected N-GoAstV, and no other reference viruses were detected. These results suggest that the newly established RT-PSR assay could, in one step, accomplish reverse-transcription, amplification, and result determination providing a visible, convenient, rapid, and cost-effective test that can be carried out onsite, in order to ensure timely quarantine of N-GoAstV-infected birds, leading to effective disease control.","Ji, Jun; Chen, Qinxi; Yu, Zhengli; Xu, Xin; Mu, Xinhao; Tian, Xiang; Fu, Xiaoge; Yao, Lunguang; Bi, Yingzuo; Xie, Qingmei",Front Vet Sci,190,1

The purpose of this study was to examine the clinical significance of periodic renal, liver, and lipid testing. [Image: see text] [Image: see text] METHODS: We reviewed the charts of 265 people with HIV (PWH) who initiated outpatient care at HIV clinic between 1/1/16 and 12/21/18 and had at least two clinic visits. Analysis included frequency distributions, descriptive statistics, one-sided binomial exact tests, and Poisson models with 95% confidence intervals (CI). [Image: see text] [Image: see text] RESULTS: Eighty-five percent (221) of PWH had no laboratory abnormalities while on antiretroviral therapy (ART). The most common abnormality was a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) < 60 ml/min found in 10% of PWH. Multivariate analysis revealed that diabetes mellitus (DM) was associated with an increased risk of GFR < 60 ml/min (estimated rate ratio 2.68, 95% CI 1.35-5.33) and age < 60 years (estimated rate ratio .122, 95% CI .05-.32) was associated with a decreased risk (estimated rate ratio .24, CI .14 –.43). When a GFR was < 60 ml/min or an AST or ALT was >2X upper limit of normal (ULN), no action was taken in 52% of the cases. When an action was taken, the most common action was to repeat testing (18%). After a lipid panel result, the most common actions were to calculate a 10-year cardiovascular risk score (32%) and add a statin (18%). Taking action after lipid panel results was strongly associated with age ≥ 40 (estimated rate ratio 9.1, 95% CI 3.3-25). ART was changed in seven PWH based on GFR, AST/ALT, or lipid panel results. There were four individuals with poor outcomes including cerebrovascular accident, acute renal failure, end stage renal disease, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, and death. Contributing factors were hypertension, DM, and hypercholesterolemia. CONCLUSION: Individuals < 40 years without ithout comorbidities had a low risk of having clinically significant renal and liver function abnormalities and rarely had actions taken after renal, liver, or lipid results. In the era of COVID-19 and beyond, it may be prudent for in certain groups to delay or eliminate liver, renal, and lipid testing to eliminate exposure, reduce cost, and avoid patient anxiety.

Only a few and mostly small randomized trials have studied antihypertensive treatments in people of African descent living in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: In this open-label, three-arm, parallel randomized controlled trial conducted at two rural hospitals in Lesotho and Tanzania, we compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of three antihypertensive treatment strategies among participants aged ≥ 18 years. The study includes patients with untreated uncomplicated arterial hypertension diagnosed by a standardized office blood pressure ≥ 140/90 mmHg. The trial encompasses a superiority comparison between a triple low-dose antihypertensive drug combination versus the current standard of care (monotherapy followed by dual treatment), as well as a non-inferiority comparison for a dual drug combination versus standard of care with optional dose titration after 4 and 8 weeks for participants not reaching the target blood pressure. The sample size is 1268 participants with parallel allocation and a randomization ratio of 2:1:2 for the dual, triple and control arms, respectively. The primary endpoint is the proportion of participants reaching a target blood pressure at 12 weeks of ≤ 130/80 mmHg and ≤ 140/90 mmHg among those aged < 65 years and ≥ 65 years, respectively. Clinical manifestations of end-organ damage and cost-effectiveness at 6 months are secondary endpoints.

Spatial video (SV) has proven to be a useful tool to collect environmental and social data at a granular scale, though the effort required to turn these spatially encoded video frames into maps limits sustainability and scalability. In this paper we explore the use of convolution neural networks (CNN) to solve this problem by automatically identifying disease related environmental risks in a series of SV collected from Haiti. Our objective is to determine the potential of machine learning in health risk mapping for these environments by assessing the challenges faced in adequately training the required classification models. RESULTS: We show that SV can be a suitable source for automatically identifying and extracting health risk features using machine learning. While well-defined objects such as drains, buckets, tires and animals can be efficiently classified, more amorphous masses such as trash or standing water are difficult to classify. Our results further show that variations in the number of image frames selected, the image resolution, and combinations of these can be used to improve the overall model performance. CONCLUSION: Machine learning in combination with spatial video can be used to automatically identify environmental risks associated with common health problems in informal settlements, though there are likely to be variations in the type of data needed for training based on location. Success based on the risk type being identified are also likely to vary geographically. However, we are confident in identifying a series of best practices for data collection, model training and performance in these settings. We also discuss the next step of testing these findings in other environments, and how adding in the simultaneously collected geographic data could be used to create an automatic health risk mapping tool.","Ajayakumar, Jayakrishnan; Curtis, Andrew J.; Rouzier, Vanessa; Pape, Jean William; Bempah, Sandra; Alam, Meer Taifur; Alam, Md.

BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that clinical manifestations of children’s COVID-19 may be less severe. However, it has been described the pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome temporally associated with SARS-CoV-2 (PIMS-TS) which resembles other inflammatory conditions (i.e. Kawasaki disease). Patients affected by PIMS-TS showed cardiac involvement with myocardial injury, reduced left ventricle systolic function and coronary artery abnormalities. Little is known regarding cardiac involvement in pediatric patients with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS: We analyzed 23 pediatric patients (13males, 56%) with diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection based on PCR analysis of nasopharingeal swab (NPS), and asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic for COVID-19. Patients underwent standard transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) within 2-3 month from diagnosis and after negative NPS for SARS-CoV-2. We performed offline analysis with GE EchoPAC software to measure global longitudinal strain (GLS) of the LV using 2D speckle tracking imaging. Therefore, we compared the results with a matched group of 23 controls (13males, 56%). RESULTS: Cases and controls were similar regarding age (5.9 ± 4.1years vs. 6.4 ± 4.4 years, p = 0.63), body surface area (0.98 ± 0.3m2 vs. 0.8 ± 0.4m2, p = 0.17), LV FS (37.9 ± 5.9% vs. 36.4 ± 8.3%, p = 0.74) and LV biplane EF (63.9 ± 5.2% vs. 66.4 ± 5.3%, p = 0.11). GLS analysis showed significant strain reduction of the LV mid-wall segments and of the basal anterior, posterior and septal inferior segments among cases compared to controls. Furthermore, in the case group there were 7 subjects (30%) with a strain below 16.5% in at least 3 segments. CONCLUSION: SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect LV deformation in asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic children, showing a peculiar pattern with lower longitudinal strain in all mid-wall segments of LV compared to control subjects. The clinical significance of this findings is unclear and follow-up is needed to verify the reversibility of this alterations.","Sirico, D; Costenaro, P; Di Chiara, C; Dona"", D; Cozzani, S; Fumanelli, J; Di Candia, A; Biffanti, R; Cerutti, A; Reffo, E; Castaldi, B; Da Dalt, L; Giaquinto, C; Di Salvo, G",Eur Heart J Cardiovasc Imaging,190,3

Most studies of the sensitivity, specificity, commutability, and harmonization of autoantibody testing have focused on widely available, commercially developed and agency-certified autoantibody kits. However, this is only a small part of the spectrum of autoantibody tests that are provided through laboratories world-wide. This manuscript will review the wider spectrum of testing by exploring the innovation pathway that begins with autoantibody discovery followed by assessment of clinical relevance, accuracy, validation, and then consideration of regulatory requirements as an approved diagnostic test. Some tests are offered as “Research Use Only (RUO)”, some as “Laboratory Developed Tests (LDT)”, some enter Health Technology Assessment (HTA) pathways, while others are relegated to a “death valley” of autoantibody discovery and become “orphan” autoantibodies. Those that achieve regulatory approval are further threatened by the business world’s “Darwinian Sea of Survival”. As one example of the trappings of autoantibody progression or failure, it is reported that more than 200 different autoantibodies have been described in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), a small handful (~10%) of these have achieved regulatory approval and are widely available as commercial diagnostic kits, while a few others may be available as RUO or LDT assays. However, the vast majority (90%) are orphaned and languish in an autoantibody ‘death valley’. This review proposes that it is important to keep an inventory of these “orphan autoantibodies” in ‘death valley’ because, with the increasing availability of multi-analyte arrays and artificial intelligence (MAAI), some can be rescued to achieve a useful role in clinical diagnostic especially in light of patient stratification and precision medicine.","Fritzler, Marvin J.; Choi, May Y.; Satoh, Minoru; Mahler, Michael",Front Immunol,190,16

Different fabric types affect thermal comfort through moisture absorption and thermal insulation. This study examined the impact of cotton and wool sleepwear on menopausal women’s sleep quality. METHODS: This is a randomized, crossover, repeated-measures and triple-blinded trial comparing the sleep quality and vasomotor symptoms of healthy menopausal women between cotton and wool sleepwear at 30°C, 50% relative humidity. Participants undergo 6 laboratory visits. After a screening visit and a familiarization night, participants are randomized to 4 nights (2 nights in cotton and 2 nights in wool sleepwear) during which polysomnography and actigraphy recordings are taken including objective hot flush events, room temperature and relative humidity measurements, as well as subjective questionnaires on clothing comfort, mood and vasomotor symptoms. RESULTS: Eleven participants (age 51.2±4.7 years, BMI 26.8±2.9 kg.m-2, Insomnia Severity Index 11.1±5.5) completed all six visits so far.

Today, the use of chemical or genetic fusion constructs have been undertaken to overcome the low immunogenicity of M2e in vaccine formulation. However, current M2e vaccines are neither orally delivered nor heat-stable. In this study, we evaluated the immune efficacy of an orally delivered recombinant M2e vaccine containing 3 molcules of M2e consensus sequence of influenza A viruses, termed RSM2e3. To accomplish this, CotB, a spore coat of Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis), was used as a fusion partner, and heat-stable nonpathogenic B. subtilis spores were used as the carrier. Our results showed that CotB-M2e3 fusion had no effect on spore structure or function in the resultant recombinant RSM2e3 strain and that heterologous influenza virus M2e protein was successfully displayed on the surface of the recombinant RSM2e3 spore. Importantly, recombinant RSM2e3 spores elicited strong and long-term M2e-specific systemic and mucosal immune responses, completely protecting immunized mice from lethal challenge of A/PR/8/34(H1N1) influenza virus. Taken together, our study forms a solid basis for the development of a novel orally delivered and heat-stable influenza vaccine based on B. subtilis spore surface display.","Zhao, Guangyu; Miao, Yu; Guo, Yan; Qiu, Hongjie; Sun, Shihui; Kou, Zhihua; Yu, Hong; Li, Junfeng; Chen, Yue; Jiang, Shibo; Du, Lanying; Zhou, Yusen",Human vaccines & immunotherapeutics,190,13

Choice of mesh and fixation methods are considered crucial issues in preventing recurrences and complications. Lightweight meshes are considered the first choice due to their biomechanical properties and the ability to integrate into the abdominal wall. Titanium helicoidal tacks still represent the ""gold standard"" for mesh fixation, even if they have been suggested to be involved in the genesis of post-operative pain and complications. Recently, absorbable tacks have been introduced, under the hypothesis that there will be no need to maintain a permanent fixation device after mesh integration. Nevertheless, there is no evidence that absorbable tacks may guarantee the same results as titanium tacks in terms of strength of fixation and recurrence rates. The primary end point of the present trial is to test the hypothesis that absorbable tacks are non-inferior to titanium tacks in laparoscopic incisional and ventral hernia repair (LIVHR) by lightweight polypropylene mesh, in terms of recurrence rates at 3-year follow-up. Surgical complications, post-operative stay, comfort and pain are secondary end points to be assessed. METHODS/DESIGN Two hundred and twenty patients with ventral hernia will be randomized into 2 groups: Group A (110) patients will be submitted to LIVHR by lightweight polypropylene mesh fixed by titanium tacks; Group B (110) patients will be submitted to LIVHR by lightweight polypropylene mesh fixed by absorbable tacks. DISCUSSION A few retrospective studies have reported similar results when comparing absorbable versus non-absorbable tacks in terms of intraoperative and early post-operative outcomes. These studies have the pitfalls to be retrospective evaluation of small series of patients, and the reported results still need to be validated by larger series and prospective studies. The aim of the present trial is to investigate and test the non-inferiority of absorbable versus non-absorbable tacks in terms of hernia recurrence rates, in order to assess whether the use of absorbable tacks may achieve the same results as non-absorbable tacks in mid-term and long-term settings.

Data were included for the period of June 1, 2004, to May 31, 2005. Data linkage was performed using sex, postal code, and date of birth. The most common self-reported reasons for absence were respiratory illness (31%), gastrointestinal illness (17%), and musculoskeletal injuries/disabilities (15%). Employees working in the Department of General Medicine experienced the highest number of times absent--1.9 per 1,000 work hours. The department with the highest percentage of staff not reporting to OH was General Medicine (43%). This research highlights the issue of absenteeism among health care workers and the need to improve reporting of illness and injury to OH for surveillance efficacy.

Particle size distributions are shown to fit well with a 2-parameter Gamma distribution. Settling velocity is generally higher for larger particles, except when particle density and sphericity change. For most food types, particle specific gravity was close to unity. Egg shell particles had a significantly higher specific gravity. This information, combined with the particle size data have been used to show that there is a very low likelihood of food waste particle deposition in sewers during normal operational flows, other than temporary transient deposits of egg shell particles.","Legge, Abigail; Nichols, Andy; Jensen, Henriette; Tait, Simon; Ashley, Richard",Water science and technology : a journal of the International Association on Water Pollution Research,190,1

DESIGN Consensus conference of experts in pediatric acute lung injury. METHODS A panel of 27 experts met over the course of 2 years to develop a taxonomy to define pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome and to make recommendations regarding treatment and research priorities. The monitoring subgroup comprised two experts. When published data were lacking a modified Delphi approach, emphasizing strong professional agreement was used. RESULTS The Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference experts developed and voted on a total of 151 recommendations addressing the topics related to pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome, 21 of which related to monitoring of a child with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. All 21 recommendations had agreement, with 19 (90%) reaching strong agreement. CONCLUSIONS The Consensus Conference developed pediatric-specific recommendations related to monitoring children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. These include interpreting monitored values such as tidal volume using predicted body weight, monitoring tidal volume at the end of the endotracheal tube in small children, and continuous monitoring of exhaled carbon dioxide in intubated children with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome, among others.

In Experiment 1, corn and sorghum grains were milled, reconstituted to 35% moisture, and ensiled in a bag silo for 10 different times. There were three replications per ensiling time and grain source. Samples from each replication were analyzed in triplicate for total nitrogen (N), non-protein nitrogen (NPN), soluble N, insoluble N, and neutral detergent insoluble nitrogen (NDIN). In Experiment 2, five Nellore bulls were used in a 5 × 5 Latin square design. Four diets were comprised of 28.4% corn silage, 10.7% supplement, and 60.9% dry ground corn, dry ground sorghum, reconstituted and ensiled corn, or reconstituted and ensiled ground sorghum. An additional diet comprised of 45% corn silage, 10.7% supplement, and 44.3% dry ground corn (Roughage+) was used. Each experimental period lasted 22 days, with an adaptation period of 14 days followed by 5 days of total feces and urine collection and 3 days of collecting omasal samples. Data were analyzed using the MIXED procedure of SAS 9.4. The reconstitution and ensiling process reduced (P < 0.05) the insoluble N fraction, increased (P < 0.05) non-protein nitrogen of corn and sorghum grains, tended (P = 0.052) to increase microbial efficiency, and increased (P < 0.05) intestinal and total digestion of dry matter (DM), organic matter (OM), crude protein (CP), and starch. The concentrate level affected neither (P > 0.05) DM intake nor rumen pH. On the other hand, bulls fed diets based on 72% concentrate showed greater (P < 0.05) DM, OM, and CP digestibility compared with those fed a diet based on 55% concentrate. In addition, animals fed diets based on corn grains (both reconstituted and ensiled or dry) presented greater (P < 0.05) intestinal and total starch digestion compared to those fed sorghum grain. Therefore, the reconstitution process can reduce the insoluble N fraction and increase nutrient availability.","Silva, Breno de Castro; Pacheco, Marcos Vinicius Carneiro; Godoi, Letícia Artuzo; Alhadas, Herlon Menegueli; Pereira, Jéssica Marcela Vieira; Rennó, Luciana Navajas; Detmann, Edenio; Paulino, Pedro Veiga Rodrigues; Schoonmaker, Jon Patrick; Valadares Filho, Sebastião de Campos",PloS one,190,16

Limited evidence exists in selecting the appropriate revisional operation: laparoscopic gastric bypass (LGB), laparoscopic re-sleeve gastrectomy (LRSG), or other surgical intervention (OSI), to address weight regain. We systematically reviewed the literature to assess the efficacy of existing revisional surgery. A comprehensive search of electronic databases (e.g., Medline, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library) was completed. All randomized controlled trials, non-randomized comparison study, and case series were included. Eleven primary studies (218 patients) were identified and included in the systematic review. Studies were grouped into three main categories: LGB, LRSG, and OSI. Preoperative body mass index (BMI) was 41.9 kg/m(2) (LGB), 38.5 kg/m(2) (LRSG), and 44.4 kg/m(2) (OSI). After conversion to LGB, BMI decreased to 33.7 and 35.7 kg/m(2) at 12 and 24 months of follow-up, respectively. Excess weight loss (EWL) was 60 and 48 % over the same periods. After LRSG, BMI decreased to 30.4 and 35.3 kg/m(2) with corresponding EWL of 68 and 44 %, at 12 and 24 months, respectively. After OSI, BMI decreased to 27.3 kg/m(2) with an EWL of 75 % at 24-month follow-up but could not be analyzed due to incomplete data collection in primary studies.

Migrants are overrepresented in COVID-19 laboratory-confirmed cases, hospital admissions, intensive care treatment and death statistics in all countries with available data. A syndemic approach has been suggested to understand the excess burden in vulnerable populations. However, this has not stopped the unequal burden of disease in Norway. Initially, the disease was mainly imported by Norwegians returning from skiing holidays in the Alps, and the prevalence of infection among migrants in Norway, defined as people born abroad to foreign parents, was low. Later, confirmed cases in migrants increased and have remained stable at 35-50% - more than twice the proportion of the migrant population (15%). To change this pattern, we need to understand the complex mechanisms underlying inequities in health and their relative and multiplying impacts on disease inequalities and to test the effect of counterfactual policies in order to reduce inequalities in disease burden. Yet, the current paradigm in the field of migration and health research, that is, the theories, research methods and explanatory models commonly applied, fail to fully understand the differences in health outcomes between international migrants and the host population. Here, we use the Norwegian situation as a case to explain the need for an innovative, system-level, interdisciplinary approach at a global level.","Diaz, Esperanza; Mamelund, Svenn-Eirik; Eid, Jarle; Aasen, Henriette Sinding; Martin Kaarbøe, Oddvar; Brokstad, Rebecca Jane Cox; Gloppen, Siri; Beyer, Anders; Kumar, Bernadette Nirmal",Scandinavian journal of public health,190,33

However, absorbable sutures have performed favorably in an animal model. METHODS Two-strand sutures using the interlocking modified Kessler method with polydioxanone absorbable sutures 4-0 were used to repair completely ruptured flexor tendons in 55 fingers from 41 consecutive patients. The medical records of average 42 follow up weeks were analyzed retrospectively. The data analyzed using the chi-squared test, and Fisher's exact test was used for postoperative complications. The results were compared with those of other studies. RESULTS Among the index, middle, ring, and little fingers were injured in 9, 17, 16, and 13 fingers, respectively. The injury levels varied from zone 1 to 5. Of the 55 digits in our study, there were 26 (47%) isolated flexor digitorum profundus (FDP) injuries and 29 (53%) combined FDP and with flexor digitorum superficialis injuries. Pulley repair was also conducted. Concomitant injuries of blood vessels and nerves were found in 17 patients (23 fingers); nerve injuries occurred in 5 patients (10 fingers). Two patients had ruptures (3.6%), and one patient had two adhesions (3.6%). Using the original Strickland criteria, all the patients were assessed to be excellent or good. Also, fibrosis and long-term foreign body tissue reactions such as stitch granuloma were less likely occurred in our study. Compared to the Cullen's report that used nonabsorbable sutures, there was no significant difference in the rupture or adhesion rates. CONCLUSIONS Therefore, this study suggests that appropriate absorbable core sutures can be used safely for flexor tendon repairs.","Kang, Hyung Joo; Lee, Dong Chul; Kim, Jin Soo; Ki, Sae Hwi; Roh, Si Young; Yang, Jae Won",Archives of plastic surgery,190,1

Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with previously depressed patients in (partial) remission where preventive psychological interventions with or without antidepressants (including tapering) were compared with antidepressant control were included. Data were extracted independently from published trials. A random-effects meta-analysis on time to relapse (hazard ratio, HR) and risk of relapse (risk ratio, RR) at the last point of follow-up was conducted. PROSPERO ID: CRD42017055301. RESULTS Among 11 included trials (n = 1559), we did not observe an increased risk of relapse for participants receiving a psychological intervention while tapering antidepressants versus antidepressants alone (RR = 1.02, 95% CI 0.84-1.25; P = 0.85). Psychological interventions added to antidepressants significantly reduced the risk of relapse (RR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.97; P = 0.01) compared with antidepressants alone. CONCLUSIONS This study found no evidence to suggest that adding a psychological intervention to tapering increases the risk of relapse when compared with antidepressants alone. Adding a psychological intervention to antidepressant use reduces relapse risk significantly versus antidepressants alone. As neither strategy is routinely implemented these findings are relevant for patients, clinicians and guideline developers.","Breedvelt, Josefien Johanna Froukje; Brouwer, Maria Elisabeth; Harrer, Mathias; Semkovska, Maria; Ebert, David Daniel; Cuijpers, Pim; Bockting, Claudi Louisa Hermina",The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science,190,1

The prognostic value of age, physical status, and duration of surgery on perioperative course has been extensively studied. However, the impact of deep hypnotic time (time when Bispectral Index values are less than 40) has not been well evaluated. Methods. We designed an observational study to clarify the relative influence of deep hypnotic time (DHT) on outcome. Eligible participants were mentally stable patients over 18 years old scheduled for elective major abdominal surgery. In total, 248 patients enrolled. Data were analyzed using Fisher's exact test and multiple logistic regression. Results. Five variables (DHT, hypotension, age, comorbidity, and duration of surgery) showed statistically significant association with complications, when examined independently. However, when all variables were examined together in a multiple logistic regression model, age and comorbidity were no longer associated with outcome. DHT, hypotension, and duration of surgery were significant predictors of ""complications,"" and ""hypotension"" was a significant predictor of prolonged hospital stay (P < 0.001). Conclusion. Deep hypnotic time emerged as a new factor associated with outcome, and its impact compared to other factors such as age, surgery duration, hypotension, and comorbidity is redefined. Monitoring and managing depth of anesthesia during surgery are important and should be part of careful operation planning.","Petsiti, Argyro; Tassoudis, Vassilios; Vretzakis, George; Zacharoulis, Dimitrios; Tepetes, Konstantinos; Ganeli, Georgia; Karanikolas, Menelaos",Anesthesiology research and practice,190,16

OBJECTIVES To examine the effects of the COVID-19 confinement on lifestyle behaviours in Spanish children, and to assess the influence of social vulnerabilities on changes in lifestyle behaviours. METHODS Physical activity (PA), screen time, sleep time, adherence to the Mediterranean diet (KIDMED) and sociodemographic information were longitudinally assessed before (N = 291, 12.1 ± 2.4 years, 47.8% girls) and during the COVID-19 confinement (N = 113, 12.0 ± 2.6 years, 48.7% girls) by online questionnaires. RESULTS During the COVID-19 confinement, PA (-91 ± 55 min/d, P < .001) and screen time (±2.6 h/d, P < .001) worsened, whereas the KIDMED score improved (0.5 ± 2.2 points, P < .02). The decrease of PA was higher in children with mother of non-Spanish origin (-1.8 ± 0.2 vs -1.5 ± 0.1 h/d, P < .04) or with non-university studies (-1.7 ± 0.1 vs -1.3 ± 0.1 h/d, P < .005) in comparison to their counterparts. CONCLUSION This study evidence the negative impact of the COVID-19 confinement on PA levels and sedentary behaviours of Spanish children. These findings should be taken into account to design and implement public health strategies for preserving children´s health during and after the pandemic, particularly, in children with social vulnerabilities.","Medrano, María; Cadenas-Sanchez, Cristina; Oses, Maddi; Arenaza, Lide; Amasene, Maria; Labayen, Idoia",Pediatric obesity,190,30

The neurocutaneous flap depends on the lateral antebrachial cutaneous nerve (LACN) and its retrograde-flow has been studied via cadaveric dissection. The aim of this study is to prove the vascularity of the lateral antebrachial neurocutaneous (LABN) flap. METHODS The distally based LABN flap was created in 18 upper limbs (12 cadavers). The skin flap was dissected at the proximal half of the forearm and then diluted methylene blue was injected through the brachial artery. The pedicle of the flap on the distal half of the forearm was dissected along the LACN for the anatomical study of the perforating branches, paraneural vessels, and flap territory. RESULTS The mean age of cadavers was 74.1 years (nine males). The mean distance of most distal and proximal perforating branches from the radial styloid process were 2.32 ± 0.59 and 11.17 ± 1.72 cm, respectively. The mean total number of perforating branches was 7.4, which abundantly appeared approximately 4 to 5 cm from the radial styloid process. The mean flap territory was 8.64 ± 0.82 cm in width and 10.50 ± 1.90 cm in length. The mean forearm circumference was 24.84 ± 1.52 cm, and mean forearm length was 24.74 ± 1.8 cm. CONCLUSION This study ensured that retrograde-flow via the neurocutaneous artery could be provided through the vascularity of the LABN flap, which suggests that the pivot point of the flap should not extend beyond 5 cm proximal to the radial styloid process. The LABN flap is a useful alternative method for performing soft tissue reconstruction in hand and wrist defects without sacrificing the major vessels.","Kanchanathepsak, Thepparat; Rojpitipongsakorn, Chanakarn; Tawonsawatruk, Tulyapruek; Suppaphol, Sorasak; Watcharananan, Ittirat; Tuntiyatorn, Panithan",Journal of reconstructive microsurgery,190,1

Availability of oxygen cylinders for mechanically ventilated patient may be difficult in such a context. A solution to ventilate patients requiring high FiO2 is to use a ventilator able to be supplied by a low-pressure oxygen source connected with 2 oxygen concentrators. We tested the Resmed Elisée®350 ventilator paired with two Newlife® Intensity 10 (Airsep) oxygen concentrator and evaluated the delivered fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) across a range of minute volumes and combinations of ventilator settings. METHODS The ventilators were attached to a test lung, OC flow was adjusted with a Certifier®FA ventilator test systems from 2L/min to 10L/min and injected into the oxygen inlet port of the Elisée®350. FiO2 was measured by the analyzer integrated in the ventilator, controlled by the ventilator test system. Several combinations of ventilator settings were evaluated to determine the factors affecting the delivered FiO2. RESULTS The Elisée®350 ventilator is a turbine ventilator able to deliver high FiO2 when functioning with two oxygen concentrators. However, modifications of the ventilator settings such as an increase in minute ventilation affect delivered FiO2 even if oxygen flow is constant on the oxygen concentrator. CONCLUSIONS The ability of two oxygen concentrator to deliver high FiO2 when used with a turbine ventilator makes this method of oxygen delivery a viable alternative to cylinders to ventilate patients requiring FiO2≥80% in austere place or during disaster response LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: V, feasibility study on test bench.","Cardinale, Michaël; Cungi, Pierre-Julien; Bordes, Julien; Cohergne, Fabien; Schmitt, Sarah; Langlois, Alix; Meaudre, Eric; Lacroix, Guillaume",The journal of trauma and acute care surgery,190,1

This study was undertaken to evaluate the results of a laparoscopic hepatectomy in the setting of cirrhosis. METHODS Subgroup analysis of patients with cirrhosis within a series of 327 patients undergoing a laparoscopic resection was performed. Comparisons were made with patients without cirrhosis where appropriate to highlight differences in patient selection and outcomes. Specific variables assessed included operative details and short-term outcomes including length of stay (LOS), morbidity and mortality. Outcomes specific to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were also assessed. RESULTS There were 52 patients with cirrhosis undergoing a laparoscopic hepatic resection. Ninety per cent of patients were Childs class A, with a median model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score of 8. Hepatitis C was the most common cause of cirrhosis (88.5%), whereas the most common indication for an operation was HCC (71.2%). Resections were generally limited, with the median number of segments resected being 2 (range: 1-4). Complications occurred in 13 (25%) patients, with a 90-day mortality of 5.8%. The median LOS was 3 days. CONCLUSIONS A laparoscopic hepatectomy is safe in the setting of cirrhosis, provided the application of appropriate selection criteria and sufficient experience with the procedure.","Cannon, Robert M; Saggi, Bob; Buell, Joseph F",HPB : the official journal of the International Hepato Pancreato Biliary Association,190,24

Although there are a number of issues to be considered, the following points are most urgent: The potential for domesticated (companion) animals to serve as a reservoir of infection contributing to continued human-to-human disease, infectivity, and community spread. The ramifications to food security, economy, and trade issues should coronavirus establish itself within livestock and poultry. The disruption to national security if SARS-CoV-2 and its fairly well-established effects on smell (hyposmia/anosmia) to critical military service animals including explosive detector dog, narcotics detector dog, specialized search dog, combat tracker dog, mine detection dog, tactical explosive detector dog, improvised explosive device detector dog, patrol explosive detector dog, and patrol narcotics detector dog, as well as multipurpose canines used by special operations such as used by the U.S. customs and border protection agency (e.g., Beagle Brigade). This article presents in chronological order data that both individually (as received independently from multiple countries) and collectively urge studies that elucidate the following questions. 1.What animal species can be infected with SARS-CoV-2, the likely sources of infection, the period of infectivity, and transmissibility between these animals and to other animal species and humans? 2.What are the best diagnostic tests currently available for companion animals and livestock? 3.What expressions of illness in companion and other animal species can serve as disease markers? Although it is recognized that robust funding and methodology need to be identified to apply the best scientific investigation into these issues, there may be easily identifiable opportunities to capture information that can guide decision and study. First, it may be possible to quickly initiate a data collection strategy using in-place animal gatekeepers, such as zookeepers, veterinarians, kennel owners, feed lots, and military animal handlers. If provided a simple surveillance form, their detection of symptoms (lethargy, hyposmia, anosmia, and others) might be quickly reported to a central data collection site if one were created. Second, although current human COVID-19 disease is aligning around areas of population density and cluster events, it might be possible to overlay animal species density or veterinary reports that could signal some disease association in animals with COVID-19 patients. Unfortunately, although companion animals and zoo species have repeatedly served as sentinels for emerging infectious diseases, they do not currently fall under the jurisdiction of any federal agency and are not under surveillance.","McNamara, Tracey; Richt, Juergen A; Glickman, Larry",Vector borne and zoonotic diseases,190,11

We targeted conserved N-glycosylated carbohydrate ligands on viral envelope surfaces using novel immune therapies. Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and L-ficolin (L-FCN) were selected because they function as opsonins and activate complement. Given that MBL has a complex quaternary structure unsuitable for large scale cost-effective production, we sought to develop a less complex chimeric fusion protein with similar ligand recognition and enhanced effector functions. We tested recombinant human MBL and three L-FCN/MBL variants that contained the MBL carbohydrate recognition domain and varying lengths of the L-FCN collagenous domain. Non-reduced chimeric proteins formed predominantly nona- and dodecameric oligomers, whereas recombinant human MBL formed octadecameric and larger oligomers. Surface plasmon resonance revealed that L-FCN/MBL76 had the highest binding affinities for N-acetylglucosamine-bovine serum albumin and mannan. The same chimeric protein displayed superior complement C4 cleavage and binding to calreticulin (cC1qR), a putative receptor for MBL. L-FCN/MBL76 reduced infection by wild type Ebola virus Zaire significantly greater than the other molecules. Tapping mode atomic force microscopy revealed that L-FCN/MBL76 was significantly less tall than the other molecules despite similar polypeptide lengths. We propose that alterations in the quaternary structure of L-FCN/MBL76 resulted in greater flexibility in the collagenous or neck region. Similarly, a more pliable molecule might enhance cooperativity between the carbohydrate recognition domains and their cognate ligands, complement activation, and calreticulin binding dynamics. L-FCN/MBL chimeric proteins should be considered as potential novel therapeutics.","Michelow, Ian C; Dong, Mingdong; Mungall, Bruce A; Yantosca, L Michael; Lear, Calli; Ji, Xin; Karpel, Marshall; Rootes, Christina L; Brudner, Matthew; Houen, Gunnar; Eisen, Damon P; Kinane, T Bernard; Takahashi, Kazue; Stahl, Gregory L; Olinger, Gene G; Spear, Gregory T; Ezekowitz, R Alan B; Schmidt, Emmett V",The Journal of biological chemistry,190,1

Caerulein and palmitoleic acid (POA)/ethanol-induced pancreatitis was more severe in both Ins2Akita and PACIRKO vs control mice, suggesting that endogenous insulin directly protects acinar cells in vivo. In isolated pancreatic acinar cells, insulin induced Akt-mediated phosphorylation of 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 2 (PFKFB2) which upregulated glycolysis thereby preventing POA-induced ATP depletion, inhibition of the ATP-dependent plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase (PMCA) and cytotoxic Ca2+ overload.

The beverage industry attempted to secure state preemption through front groups and trade associations, lobbying key policymakers, inserting preemptive language into other legislation, and issuing legal threats and challenges.

As of July 3, 2020, the number of confirmed cases has been nearly 11 million with 521,000 fatalities. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is accountable for COVID-19. Newly diagnosed and worsening cardiovascular disease are common complications in COVID-19 patients, including acute cardiac injury, hypertension, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, heart failure and sudden cardiac arrest. The mechanisms contributing to cardiac disease burden include hypoxemia, inflammatory factor storm, dysfunctional angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), and drug-induced cardiac toxicity. Notably, the macrophages expressing ACE2 as direct host cells of SARS-CoV-2 secrete chemokine and inflammatory cytokines, as well as a decrease in cellular immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection due to elevated exhaustion levels and dysfunctional diversity of T cells, that may be accountable for the ""hyperinflammation and cytokine storm syndrome"" and subsequently acute cardiac injury and deteriorating cardiovascular disease in COVID-19 patients. However, no targeted medication or vaccines for COVID-19 are yet available. The management of cardiovascular disease in patients with COVID-19 include general supportive treatment, circulatory support, other symptomatic treatment, psychological assistance as well as online consultation.

In New South Wales (NSW), the most populous state in Australia, COVID-19 case numbers have to date been relatively low. However, that does not mean the state's healthcare system has been unaffected. Preparations to create sufficient capacity to accommodate a COVID-19 surge resulted in widespread deferment of scheduled medical procedures and appointments. Patterns of healthcare-seeking behaviour changed, with a reluctance to visit healthcare settings. The aim of this study was to quantify the changes in activity seen in the NSW health system in the first half of 2020. METHODS Healthcare data were drawn from multiple sources, including primary care, ambulance, emergency departments and inpatient settings. Volumes of healthcare activity in 2020, overall, by urgency of cases and by reasons for care were compared with the figures for the same period in 2019. Changes in the modality of care provision were also examined. RESULTS In March to June 2020, compared with the same period in 2019, primary care face-to-face consultations decreased by 22.1%, breast screening activity by 51.5%, ambulance incidents by 7.2%, emergency department visits by 13.9%, public hospital inpatient episodes by 14.3%, and public hospital planned surgical activity by 32.6%. CONCLUSION There were substantial declines in a wide range of healthcare activities across the NSW health system between March and June 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although activity levels were recovering by September 2020, they had not yet returned to 'normal'.

Heparin and heparan sulfate antagonize the binding of these pathogens to HSPGs and stop their cellular internalization, but the anticoagulant effect of these agents has been limiting their use in the treatment of viral infections. Heparin-binding peptides (HBPs) are suitable non-anticoagulant agents that are capable to antagonize binding of heparin-binding pathogens to HSPGs. Here, we review and discuss the use of HBPs as viral uptake inhibitors and will address their benefits and limitations to treat viral infections. Furthermore, we will discuss a variant of these peptides that is in the clinic and can be considered as a novel therapy in Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) infection. Significance Statement The need to discover treatment modalities for COVID-19 is a necessity, and therapeutic interventions such as Heparin-binding Peptides (HBPs), which are used for other cases, can be beneficial based on their mechanisms of actions. In this paper, we have discussed the application of HBPs as viral uptake inhibitors in COVID-19 and explained possible mechanisms of actions and the therapeutic effects.","Tavassoly, Omid; Safavi, Farinaz; Tavassoly, Iman",Molecular pharmacology,190,12

RECENT FINDINGS The outbreak of the COVID-19 has had effect of unprecedented magnitude on the social, economic and personal aspects around the globe. Healthcare providers were forced to expand capacity to provide care to the surging number of symptomatic COVID-19 patients, while maintaining a fully operating service for all non-COVID patients. The recent literature suggesting an overall decrease in acute ischemic stroke admissions as well as total number of endovascular treatments will be reviewed. Although the underlying reasons therefore remain the matter of debate, it seems that the imposed restrictions, requiring social distancing, and stopping all nonessential services, have led to a higher threshold for patients to seek medical attention, in particular in those with less severe symptoms. Thus, raising public awareness on the importance of strokes and transient ischemic attacks is even more important in the light of the current situation to avoid serious healthcare, economic consequences, and limit long term morbidity. SUMMARY The priority remains maintaining a fast and efficient pre and in-hospital work-flow while mitigating nosocomial transmission and protecting the patient and the healthcare workers with appropriate personal protective equipment.","Dobrocky, Tomas; Kaesmacher, Johannes; Pereira, Vitor Mendes; Gralla, Jan; Fischer, Urs",Current opinion in neurology,190,28

OBJECTIVES To verify the importance of BMI as a mortality predictor, to identify other important mortality predictors, and to construct a mortality prediction rule in a population eligible for bariatric surgery. DESIGN We studied individuals from a population-representative register who met contemporary eligibility criteria for bariatric surgery (BMI, ≥35.0 alone or 30.0-34.9 with an obesity-related comorbidity) from January 1, 1988, through December 31, 1998. We used binary logistic regression to construct a parsimonious model and a clinical prediction rule for 10-year all-cause mortality. SETTING The United Kingdom General Practice Research Database, a population-representative primary care registry. PARTICIPANTS Fifteen thousand three hundred ninety-four patients aged 18 to 65 years. EXPOSURE Bariatric surgery. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE Ten-year all-cause mortality. RESULTS Mean (SD) age was 46.9 (11.9) years, BMI was 36.2 (5.5), and 63.2% of the patients were women. All-cause mortality was 2.1%, and mean follow-up duration was 9.9 years. The final model, which included age (odds ratio, 1.09 per year [95% CI, 1.07-1.10]), type 2 diabetes mellitus (2.25 [1.76-2.87]), current smoking (1.62 [1.28-2.06]), and male sex (1.50 [1.20-1.87]), had a C statistic of 0.768. Although BMI significantly predicted mortality (odds ratio, 1.03 per unit [95% CI, 1.01-1.05]), it did not improve model discrimination or calibration. We divided clinical prediction rule scoring into 4 tiers. All-cause mortality was 0.2% in tier 1, 0.9% in tier 2, 2.0% in tier 3, and 5.2% in tier 4. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE All-cause 10-year mortality in obese individuals eligible for bariatric surgery can be estimated using a simple 4-variable prediction rule based on age, sex, smoking, and diabetes mellitus. Body mass index was not an important mortality predictor. Further work is needed to define low, moderate, and high absolute risk thresholds and to provide external validation.","Padwal, Raj S; Klarenbach, Scott W; Wang, Xiaoming; Sharma, Arya M; Karmali, Shahzeer; Birch, Daniel W; Majumdar, Sumit R",JAMA surgery,190,1

Pigs were labeled as ""mixing vessels"" since they are susceptible to infection with avian, human and swine influenza viruses and genetic reassortment between these viruses can occur. After the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009 with a swine origin virus, the most recent research in ""influenzology"" is directed at improving knowledge of porcine influenza virus infection. This tendency is probably due to the fact that domestic pigs are closely related to humans and represent an excellent animal model to study various microbial infectious diseases. In spite of the role of the pig in influenza virus ecology, swine immune responses against influenza viruses are not fully understood. Considering these premises, the aim of this review is to focus on the in vitro studies performed with porcine cells and influenza virus and on the immune responses of pigs against human, avian and swine influenza viruses in vivo. The increased acceptance of pigs as suitable and valuable models in the scientific community may stimulate the development of new tools to assess porcine immune responses, paving the way for their consideration as the future ""gold standard"" large-animal model in immunology.","Crisci, Elisa; Mussá, Tufária; Fraile, Lorenzo; Montoya, Maria",Molecular immunology,190,28

OBJECTIVE The study aimed to evaluate the course and the clinical features of acne and possible risk factors during the COVID-19 pandemic in healthcare workers. METHOD A total of 172 physicians (female, n = 159, male; n = 13, mean age = 35.03 ± 5.27 years) who had acne in any period of their life were included in the study. A self-administered online questionnaire was applied. RESULTS During the COVID-19 pandemic, 45.35% of the participants reported that their acne complaints increased, 27.33% reported relapses, and 7.56% reported occurrence for the first time. Newly formed acne was reported most frequently on the chin (78.26%). The number of female participants, smoking, increased stress, and the rate of surgical mask use were found to be higher in the group whose acne occurred for the first time, relapsed, or increased than in the group whose acne complaints were unchanged or decreased (p < 0.05). In the group whose acne relapsed or increased, adult-onset acne, presence of scar, and use of systemic acne treatment before the COVID-19 pandemic were more common than in the group whose acne complaints were unchanged or decreased (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION Almost half of the participants reported an increase in acne. More than a third of the participants reported that their acne relapsed or they had acne for the first time. In addition to the use of surgical masks, factors such as increased stress, smoking, adult-onset acne, presence of scar, and previous systemic acne treatment were found to be responsible for acne development.","Özkesici Kurt, Birgül",Journal of cosmetic dermatology,190,24

Although inactivated vaccines have been deployed widely against FAdV4, a DIVA (differentiating infected from vaccinated animals) test specific for FAdV4 has not been available. We synthesized an immunogenic peptide, corresponding to regions 66-88 aa of the 22K nonstructural protein of FAdV4, and used the peptide as coating antigen to develop an indirect ELISA for a DIVA test specific to FAdV4. Specificity analysis showed that the ELISA only reacted with sera against FAdV4, and not with sera against other pathogens tested. Moreover, the ELISA could effectively differentiate FAdV4-infected chickens from vaccinated chickens. In a test of sera from experimentally infected chickens, the ELISA had 95% and 85% concordance with an indirect immunofluorescence assay (indirect IFA) and a commercial ELISA, respectively, and the concordance was 80.5% between the ELISA and the indirect IFA in detecting clinical infection samples.

OBJECTIVE To address the specialized needs of youth from such groups, this review synthesized the literature exploring the use of phone-based delivery to access pediatric populations with socially complex needs, targeting mental and behavioral health outcomes. The purpose of this synthesis was to provide recommendations for future research developing phone-based interventions for youth with socially complex needs. METHODS A trained medical librarian conducted the search strategy in the following databases: PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Google Scholar. Studies targeting youth with socially complex needs were defined by recruiting samples that were primarily from traditionally underserved populations (ie, sex/gender minorities, racial/ethnic background, low socioeconomic status, rural/remote location, and sexual orientation). A systematic narrative framework was utilized and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed (registration number CRD42020141212). RESULTS A total of 14 studies met the inclusion criteria, with 3 depicting the use of phones to complete assessment and tracking goals and 11 to intervene on mental and behavioral health targets.

Computed tomographic angiography may facilitate perforator mapping and optimize flap design. The authors performed this pilot study to determine the predictive power of computed tomographic angiography in anterolateral thigh flap planning and execution. METHODS : Sixteen consecutive computed tomographic angiography-mapped anterolateral thigh flaps for head and neck reconstruction were studied. Perforator location, origin, caliber, and course were compared between computed tomographic angiography and intraoperative findings. The relationship of patient characteristics, imaging studies, and intraoperative factors to flap design and surgical outcomes was analyzed. RESULTS : Among the 16 anterolateral thigh flaps, 40 of 54 perforators identified intraoperatively were visible on computed tomographic angiography, resulting in 74 percent sensitivity. Intraoperative perforator location averaged 0.35 cm from the computed tomographic angiography-predicted location. The overall ability of computed tomographic angiography to predict perforator size was 67.5 percent. Its overall accuracy in predicting whether a perforator took a septocutaneous or intramuscular course before perforating the deep fascia was 77.5 percent. Preoperative angiography resulted in surgeons modifying the operative plan in 37 percent of cases and 57 percent of double-island flap cases. All flaps were elevated successfully and survived. CONCLUSIONS : Computed tomographic angiography identified larger perforators better than smaller ones and proximal perforators better than distal ones. It accurately predicted the location and origin of visible perforators and less accurately predicted the size and course of visible perforators. Most importantly, the information it provided influenced surgeons to modify their reconstructive strategy, resulting in a higher level of recipient-site specificity.","Garvey, Patrick B; Selber, Jesse C; Madewell, John E; Bidaut, Luc; Feng, Lei; Yu, Peirong",Plastic and reconstructive surgery,190,15

New suture materials such as V-loc (barbed, knotless wound closure device) may offer advantages over conventional methods. The objective of this study is to determine if a running V-loc suture is of comparable tensile strength to conventional closure. STUDY DESIGN Laboratory based study of human cadaveric tissue. METHODS Fresh human cadaveric tracheas were dissected and incised into segments. Anastomosis of adjacent segments was then performed with either submucosal interrupted 3-0 Vicryl, or a running submucosal 3-0 V-loc suture. Anastomosed specimens were stretched to failure on an Instron force tension machine. Surgeon satisfaction was recorded by visual analog scale (VAS). RESULTS The tensile strength of 12 tracheal anastomoses was tested. Video documentation of V-loc suture technique and anastomosis failure was recorded. In both Vicryl (80%) and V-loc (100%) anastomoses, failure occurred at the membranous intercartilaginous region. In 20% of the Vicryl anastomoses, the suture was noted to break prior to tissue failure. Anastomoses with V-loc suture had equivalent failure force (mean, 59 N) compared to interrupted Vicryl (51 N), with P = .57. On VAS, surgeons were more satisfied with V-loc suture closure compared to interrupted Vicryl closure (paired t test, P = .003). CONCLUSIONS Tracheal anastomosis with running v-loc suture is a feasible alternative to conventional closure with interrupted Vicryl suture. V-loc suture provided a surgical advantage by improved ease of use.","Bush, Carrie M; Prosser, John D; Morrison, Michele P; Sandhu, Guri; Wenger, Karl H; Pashley, David H; Birchall, Martin A; Postma, Gregory N; Weinberger, Paul M",The Laryngoscope,190,1

METHODS Two hundred two children with displaced radius and/or ulna fractures were randomized to either circumferential (n=101) or bivalved (n=101) long-arm casts after CR. The mean age was 10±3 years. There were no significant differences between groups in terms of age, sex, or initial fracture displacement or angulation. Clinical and radiographic evaluations were performed at 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks postreduction. Radiographic loss of reduction (LOR), need for remanipulation or surgery, and associated complications of compartment syndrome, cast saw injury, and neurovascular compromise were recorded. RESULTS Overall, the median angulation of the radius and ulna fractures improved from 20 and 18 degrees to 3 and 2 degrees after CR, respectively. The median cast index after reduction was 0.78 in the bivalved group and 0.80 in the circumferential group. The median angulation of the radius and ulna was 8 and 1 degrees at 4 weeks, with no significant difference between groups. By the fourth week of follow-up, 70 patients (34%)-35 bivalved and 35 circumferential-had radiographic LOR. Forty-seven patients (23%)-23 bivalved and 24 circumferential-underwent remanipulation or surgical reduction and fixation. There were no significant differences between groups with respect to LOR rate or need for surgical treatment. One bivalved patient sustained a cast saw injury, and 3 bivalved patients had transient neurological abnormalities. No patients developed compartment syndrome. CONCLUSIONS Cast immobilization is effective in the majority of patients after CR of displaced forearm fractures. There were no significant differences in maintenance of reduction, need for surgery, or complications between bivalved or circumferential long-arm casts.

Interestingly, our data revealed that patients' viral titer was correlated with the level of Vpr detected in their plasma. Here, we first show that rVpr, when incubated with human monocytes or MDMs, caused viral production from latently infected cells, and IL-6 was identified as a responsible factor. The induction of IL-6 by rVpr was dependent on signaling through TLR4 and its adaptor molecule, MyD88. We next provide evidence that rVpr induced the formation of OxPC and that a mAb against OxPC blocked rVpr-induced IL-6 production with the concomitant attenuation of MAPK activation. Moreover, the addition of NAC, a scavenger of ROS, abrogated the rVpr-induced formation of OxPC, the phosphorylation of C/EBP-beta, a substrate of MAPK, and IL-6 production. As rIL-6 reactivated viral replication in latently infected cells, our data indicate that rVpr-induced oxidative stress triggers cell-based innate immune responses and reactivates viral production in latently infected cells via IL-6 production. Our results suggest that Vpr should be monitored based on the viral titer, and they provide the rationale for the development of novel, anti-AIDS therapeutics targeting Vpr.","Hoshino, Shigeki; Konishi, Mitsuru; Mori, Masako; Shimura, Mari; Nishitani, Chiaki; Kuroki, Yoshio; Koyanagi, Yoshio; Kano, Shigeyuki; Itabe, Hiroyuki; Ishizaka, Yukihito",Journal of leukocyte biology,190,11

This paper describes the development of an Online Bridging Program in the Division of Palliative Care at the University Health Network Toronto and examines its effectiveness in improving IMGs' readiness for Canadian fellowship training. METHODS The annual Online Bridging Program was developed to help new IMGs transitioning to Canadian palliative fellowship using Kern's framework for curriculum development. Following a needs assessment, eight online modules with weekly live sessions were developed and underwent external content validation and usability tests. After each iteration, the programme was improved based on participant feedback. Evaluation was conducted first through an online survey immediately on completion of the programme and then through qualitative interviews 6 months into the fellowship. The interviews were analysed using Braun and Clarke's model for thematic analysis. RESULTS Nine IMGs participated in the Online Bridging Program from 2018 to 2020. All nine participated in the survey and eight in the interviews. Responses to the online survey were almost unanimously positive, suggesting its effectiveness in assisting the IMGs' transitions into fellowship. The interviews revealed four major themes: the importance of combining online modules and live sessions, reducing the fellows' anxiety and easing the transition into their new role, an improved overall learning experience and recognising online format limitations. CONCLUSION The Online Bridging Program effectively eased IMG palliative medicine fellows' transition into training and enhanced their learning experience.","Al-Mohawes, Hanan; Amante, Madelaine; Hannon, Breffni; Zimmermann, Camilla; Kaya, Ebru; Al-Awamer, Ahmed",BMJ supportive & palliative care,190,31

The latter membrane fusion requires an S protein conformational flexibility that is facilitated by proteolytic cleavages. We hypothesized that the most relevant cellular proteases in this process are those closely linked to host cell receptors. The primary receptor for the human severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS) CoV is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). ACE2 immunoprecipitation captured transmembrane protease/serine subfamily member 2 (TMPRSS2), a known human airway and alveolar protease. ACE2 and TMPRSS2 colocalized on cell surfaces and enhanced the cell entry of both SARS S-pseudotyped HIV and authentic SARS-CoV. Enhanced entry correlated with TMPRSS2-mediated proteolysis of both S and ACE2. These findings indicate that a cell surface complex comprising a primary receptor and a separate endoprotease operates as a portal for activation of SARS-CoV cell entry.","Shulla, Ana; Heald-Sargent, Taylor; Subramanya, Gitanjali; Zhao, Jincun; Perlman, Stanley; Gallagher, Tom",Journal of virology,190,1

Although knowledge in the etiology of CAP is not satisfactory, in most cases, therapy is decided following probability-based criteria that are derived from studies that report the frequency of detection of pathogens in children with CAP. Areas covered: This narrative review discusses the present knowledge on pediatric CAP etiology, the limits of the aetiological studies and the tests for differentiation of viral from bacterial infections. Expert commentary: The type of therapeutic approach in pediatric CAP is chosen considering the risk of bacterial etiology and the pathogens most frequently detected in the different pediatric ages. Fear of the potential negative course of unrecognized and untreated bacterial CAP is the main reason for the large use of antibiotics. Unfortunately, the antibiotic prescription is unnecessary in most of the cases as it can favor the emergence of resistant strains and can increase the number of drug-related adverse events. However, it is likely that a significant reduction of antibiotic prescriptions will occur when point-of-care tests with biomarkers for differentiation viral from bacterial infections become available.","Esposito, Susanna; Principi, Nicola",Expert review of respiratory medicine,190,12

The scientific and medical communities are rallying to study different strains and probable mutations to develop more rapid and reliable molecular diagnostic tests and possible therapeutic approaches for SARSCoV-2. INTRODUCTION In the first section, following the introductory part, we shed light on structural and pathogenic features of SARS-CoV-2 and risk factors related to age, gender, neonatal and comorbidities. The next section summarizes the current diagnostic tests for COVID-19 such as nucleic acid and computed tomography (CT) techniques with further emphasizing on emerging diagnostic approaches for COVID-19. METHODS Further, we also review the ongoing therapeutic practices which can block virus-host interaction, cease viral proliferation or inhibit hyperbolic host immune response with subsections on drug therapy, cell therapy, immunotherapy and herbal medicines which are being used for the possible treatment of patients.

However, the published research about SA and older adult's health are sparse in Palestine. Objectives This study aimed to determine the prevalence and correlates of SA, normal aging, and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) among Palestinian older adults in Hebron governorates. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted during March 2018-May 2018 among a total of 185 participants selected by stratified random sampling from five different areas in Hebron governance. SA was defined based on the multidimentional model; absence of chronic diseases, normal functional status with complete independency, maintains normal cognitive and psychological function and social engagement. Sociodemographic data, nutrition, and health status were also collected and analyzed. Results The prevalence of SA among older Palestinians (22.2%), usual aging (58.9%), and the MCI (18.9%), with no significant difference in the prevalence between men and women P <0.05. The most prevalent subdomain is independent living skill (77.8%) and the lowest is the absence of chronic diseases (30.8%). SA was associated with younger older age (60-70 years), still working, and well-nourished participants. Conclusion The results of this study revealed, successful aging is associated with younger age, still working and good nutritional status. Further research with appropriate methodology different parts of Palestine is required.","Badrasawi, Manal; Samuh, Monjed; Khallaf, Mohammed; Abuqamar, Mazen",Indian journal of public health,190,1

The synthesis of remdesivir is, however, challenging, and the overall cost is relatively high. Particularly, the stereoselective assembly of the P-chirogenic center requires recrystallization of a 1:1 isomeric p-nitrophenylphosphoramidate mixture several times to obtain the desired diastereoisomer (39%) for further coupling with the d-ribose-derived 5-alcohol. To address this problem, a variety of chiral bicyclic imidazoles were synthesized as organocatalysts for stereoselective (S)-P-phosphoramidation employing a 1:1 diastereomeric mixture of phosphoramidoyl chloridates as the coupling reagent to avoid a waste of the other diastereomer. Through a systematic study of different catalysts at different temperatures and concentrations, a mixture of the (S)- and (R)-P-phosphoramidates was obtained in 97% yield with a 96.1/3.9 ratio when 20 mol % of the chiral imidazole-cinnamaldehyde-derived carbamate was utilized in the reaction at -20 °C. A 10-g scale one-pot synthesis via a combination of (S)-P-phosphoramidation and protecting group removal followed by one-step recrystallization gave remdesivir in 70% yield and 99.3/0.7 d.r. The organocatalyst was recovered in 83% yield for reuse, and similar results were obtained. This one-pot process offers an excellent opportunity for industrial production of remdesivir.","Gannedi, Veeranjaneyulu; Villuri, Bharath Kumar; Reddy, Sivakumar N; Ku, Chiao-Chu; Wong, Chi-Huey; Hung, Shang-Cheng",The Journal of organic chemistry,190,6

RFLP analysis for the characterization of intratypic genetic variability has previously distinguished two HAdV-E4 clusters: prototype (p)-like and a-like. Our analysis of whole genome sequences confirmed two distinct lineages, which we refer to as phylogroups (PGs). PGs I and II comprise the p- and a-like genomes, respectively, and differ significantly in their G + C content (57.7% ± 0.013 vs 56.3% ± 0.015). Sequence differences distinguishing the two clades map to several regions of the genome including E3 and ITR. Bayesian analyses showed that the two phylogroups diverged approximately 602 years before the present. A relatively faster evolutionary rate was identified for PG II. Our data provide a rationale for the incorporation of phylogroup identity to HAdV-E4 strain designation to reflect the identified unique genetic characteristics that distinguish PGs I and II.","Gonzalez, Gabriel; Bair, Camden R; Lamson, Daryl M; Watanabe, Hidemi; Panto, Laura; Carr, Michael J; Kajon, Adriana E",Virology,190,9

Effective endoscopic treatments for dysplasia and intramucosal cancer, coupled with screening programs to detect BE, could help reverse the increase in the incidence of esophageal cancer. However, there are no accurate, cost-effective, minimally invasive techniques available to screen for BE, reducing the enthusiasm of gastroenterologists. Over the past 5 years, there has been significant progress in the development of screening technologies. We review existing and developing technologies, new minimally invasive imaging techniques, nonendoscopic devices for cell collection, and biomarkers that can be measured in blood or stool samples. We discuss the status of these approaches, data from clinical studies of their effects, and their anticipated strengths and weaknesses in screening.

We previously showed that androgen receptor overexpression inhibited fear memory in male mice and increased expression of the histone variant H2A.Z, a novel epigenetic regulator of memory. Here, we used conditional-inducible H2A.Z knockout mice to investigate how H2A.Z deletion influences androgenic regulation of fear memory. We showed that conditional inducible H2A.Z deletion blocked memory-enhancing effects of androgen depletion (induced by gonadectomy), and of pharmacological inhibition of the androgen receptor with flutamide. Similarly, H2A.Z deletion blocked the memory-reducing effects of DHT, and DHT treatment in cultured hippocampal neurons altered H2A.Z binding, suggesting that AR is an H2A.Z regulator in neurons. Overall, these data show that fear memory formation is regulated by interactions between sex hormones and epigenetic factors, which has implications for sex differences in fear-related disorders.","Ramzan, Firyal; Baumbach, Jennet; Monks, Ashley D; Zovkic, Iva B",Neurobiology of learning and memory,190,24

DESIGN This mixed methods study applied direct observation and interviews, epidemiologic investigation, source and contact data analysis and whole-genome sequencing. RESULTS We detected 46 SARS-CoV-2 cases and four outbreaks with a proportional representation of labour migrant and native workers in six unrelated facilities. Complete viral genome sequences revealed at least three clusters of native workers and labour migrants, two within and one between facilities. On-site inspections found adequate implementation of preventative measures, that both native workers and labour migrants showed suboptimal adherence to. Being a labour migrant was associated with living in shared housing, but not with more contacts or different sources. CONCLUSIONS The fruit and vegetable packing industry gave the impression of sufficient preparedness and control. Suboptimal adherence to the facilities' preventative guidelines could have facilitated work-floor transmission. Community and household transmission are likely to have contributed to outbreaks. We encourage further research into risk factors for transmission in labour migrants and application of these insights into targeted public health policy.","Boogaard, Laura H; Sikkema, Reina S; van Beek, Janko; Brockhoff, Henricus J; Dalebout, Eva; de Heus, Barry; Niemansburg, Sophie L; Nieuwenhuijse, David; Stougje, Danny; Verspui, Ellen; Oude Munnink, Bas B; Koopmans, Marion; Fanoy, Ewout",International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases,190,29

Cannabidiol is neuroprotective in animal models of newborn hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. This study compared the relative efficacies of cannabidiol and hypothermia in newborn hypoxic-ischemic piglets and assessed whether addition of cannabidiol augments hypothermic neuroprotection. METHODS One day-old HI (carotid clamp and FiO2 10% for 20 min) piglets were randomized to vehicle or cannabidiol 1 mg/kg i.v. u.i.d. for three doses after being submitted to normothermia or 48 h-long hypothermia with a subsequent rewarming period of 6 h. Non-manipulated piglets (naïve) served as controls. Hemodynamic or respiratory parameters as well as brain activity (aEEG amplitude) were monitored throughout the experiment. Following termination, brains were obtained for histological (TUNEL staining, apoptosis; immunohistochemistry for Iba-1, microglia), biochemical (protein carbonylation, oxidative stress; and TNFα concentration, neuroinflammation) or proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Lac/NAA: metabolic derangement; Glu/NAA: excitotoxicity). RESULTS HI led to sustained depressed brain activity and increased microglial activation, which was significantly improved by cannabidiol alone or with hypothermia but not by hypothermia alone. Hypoxic-ischemic-induced increases in Lac/NAA, Glu/NAA, TNFα or apoptosis were not reversed by either hypothermia or cannabidiol alone, but combination of the therapies did. No treatment modified the effects of HI on oxidative stress or astroglial activation. Cannabidiol treatment was well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS cannabidiol administration after hypoxia-ischemia in piglets offers some neuroprotective effects but the combination of cannabidiol and hypothermia shows some additive effect leading to more complete neuroprotection than cannabidiol or hypothermia alone.","Barata, Lorena; Arruza, Luis; Rodríguez, Maria-José; Aleo, Esther; Vierge, Eva; Criado, Enrique; Sobrino, Elena; Vargas, Carlos; Ceprián, María; Gutiérrez-Rodríguez, Ana; Hind, William; Martínez-Orgado, José",Neuropharmacology,190,31

METHODS A robotic surgery program was introduced into the gynecologic oncology fellowship program at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in June 2007. A database of patients undergoing surgical management of endometrial and cervical cancer between July 2007 and July 2008 was collected and analyzed. Changes in fellow surgical training were measured and analyzed. RESULTS Fellow surgical training for endometrial and cervical cancer underwent a dramatic transition in 12 months. The proportion of patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery increased from 3.3% (4/110 patients) to 43.5% (47/108 patients). Fellow training transitioned from primarily an open approach (94.4%) to a minimally invasive approach (11% laparoscopic, 49% robotic, 40% open) for endometrial cancer stagings, and from an open approach (100%) to an open (50%) and robotic (50%) approach for radical hysterectomies. Fellow participation in robotic procedures increased from 45% in the first 3 months to 72% within 6 months, and 92% by 12 months. The role of the fellow in robotic cases transitioned from bedside assistant to console operator within 3 months. CONCLUSIONS Fellow surgical training underwent a dramatic change with the introduction of a robotic surgery program. The management of endometrial and cervical cancer was impacted the most by robotics. Robotic surgery broadened fellowship surgical training, but balanced surgical training and standardized fellow training modules remain challenges for fellowship programs.","Hoekstra, Anna V; Morgan, Jacqueline M; Lurain, John R; Buttin, Barbara M; Singh, Diljeet K; Schink, Julian C; Lowe, M Patrick",Gynecologic oncology,190,17

STUDY DESIGN For this randomized, controlled multicenter study, ventilated infants with a double-lumen endotracheal tube were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: the open (monitored) group, in which data from the capnograph were recorded, displayed to the medical team, and used for patient care, and the masked group, in which data from the capnograph were recorded. However, the measurements were masked and not available for patient care. dETCO2 was compared with PaCO2 measurements recorded for patient care. RESULTS Fifty-five infants (25 open, 30 masked) participated in the study (median gestational age, 28.6 weeks; range, 23.5-39.0 weeks). The 2 groups were comparable. dETCO2 was in good correlation (r = 0.73; P < .001) and adequate agreement (mean ± SD of the difference, 3.0 ± 8.5 mmHg) with PaCO2. Compared with infants in the masked group, those in the monitored group had significantly (P = .03) less time with an unsafe dETCO2 level (high: 3.8% vs 8.8% or low: 3.8% vs 8.9%). The prevalence of intraventricular hemorrhage or periventricular leukomalacia rate was lower in the monitored group (P = .02) and was significantly (P < .05) associated with the independent factors dETCO2 monitoring and gestational age.

However, more insight into the test characteristics of I-FABP release is needed. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between plasma I-FABP levels and the severity of ischemic mucosal injury, and define the clinical usefulness of systemic I-FABP following ischemia. METHODS In a human experimental model, 6 cm of the jejunum, to be removed for surgical reasons, was selectively exposed to either 15, 30, or 60 minutes of ischemia (I) followed by 30 and 120 minutes of reperfusion (R). Blood and tissue was sampled at all time points. Arteriovenous (V-A) concentration differences of I-FABP were measured. Tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin/eosin, and villus height was measured to score epithelial damage. RESULTS Histologic analysis showed only minor reversible intestinal damage following 15 I and 30 I; however, severe irreversible epithelial damage was observed in the jejunum exposed to 60 I. I-FABP V-A differences paralleled the degree of tissue damage over time [7.79 (± 1.8) ng/mL, 128.6 (± 44.2) ng/mL, 463.3 (± 139.8) ng/mL for 15 I, 30 I and 60 I, respectively]. A good correlation was found between histologic epithelial damage and V-A I-FABP (r=-0.82, P<0.001). Interestingly, systemic I-FABP levels were significantly increased after 60 I of this short small intestinal segment. CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates the relationship between the duration of ischemia and the extent of tissue damage, which is reflected by I-FABP V-A plasma levels. In addition, systemic I-FABP levels appear valuable in detecting irreversible intestinal ischemia-reperfusion damage.","Schellekens, Dirk H S M; Grootjans, Joep; Dello, Simon A W G; van Bijnen, Annemarie A; van Dam, Ronald M; Dejong, Cornelis H C; Derikx, Joep P M; Buurman, Wim A",Journal of clinical gastroenterology,190,12

Dental injury occurs when the forces and impacts applied to the teeth exceed the ability of the structures to dissipate energy and stress. The purpose of this study was to measure strain, (which is the change produced in the length of the tooth by a force applied to the tooth) strain rate, and strain-time integral to the maxillary incisors and determine if they varied by experience, type of blade, or use of an alcohol protective pad (APP). METHODS A mannequin head designed to teach and test intubation was instrumented with eight single axis strain gauges placed on the four maxillary incisors: four on the facial or front surface of the incisors and four on the lingual or back, near the insertion of the incisor in the gums to measure bending strain as well as compression. Anesthesiology faculty, residents, and certified registered nurse anesthetists intubated with Macintosh and Miller blades with and without APP. Using strain-time curves, the maximum strain, strain rate, and strain time integral were calculated. RESULTS Across the 92 subjects, strain varied 8-12 fold between the 25th and 75th percentiles for all four techniques, but little by experience, while strain rate and strain integral varied 6-13 fold and 15-26 fold, respectively, for the same percentiles. Intubators who had high strain values with one blade tended to have high strains with the other blade with and without the APP (all pairwise correlation rho = 0.42-0.63). CONCLUSIONS Strain varies widely by intubator and that the use of the APP reduces strain rate which may decrease the risk of or the severity of dental injury.","Engoren, Milo; Rochlen, Lauryn R; Diehl, Matthew V; Sherman, Sarah S; Jewell, Elizabeth; Golinski, Mary; Begeman, Paul; Cavanaugh, John M",BMC anesthesiology,190,4

The absolute difference between the treatment groups is small, and elderly patients should not be denied IVT in the later time window solely because of age without other contraindications.","Ahmed, Niaz; Lees, Kennedy R; Ringleb, Peter A; Bladin, Christopher; Collas, David; Toni, Danilo; Ford, Gary A",Neurology,190,30

Routes of transmission remain to be fully understood. METHODS This prospective study compared a 1500-bed adult and 600-bed pediatric setting of a tertiary-care university hospital located in central Paris. From 24 February until 10 April 2020, all symptomatic HCWs were screened for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) on a nasopharyngeal swab. HCWs screened positive were questioned on their profession, symptoms, and occupational and nonoccupational exposures to SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS Among 1344 HCWs tested, 373 were positive (28%) and 336 (90%) corresponding questionnaires were completed. Three hospitalizations and no deaths were reported. Most HCWs (70%) had patient-facing occupational activities (22% in COVID-19 dedicated units). The total number of HCW cases peaked on 23 March, then decreased slowly, concomitantly with a continuous increase of compliance to preventive measures (including universal medical masking and personal protective equipment [PPE] for direct care to COVID-19 patients). Attack rates were of 3.2% and 2.3% in the adult and pediatric settings, respectively (P = .0022). In the adult setting, HCWs more frequently reported exposure to COVID-19 patients without PPE (25% vs 15%, P = .046). Report of contacts with children attending out-of-home care facilities dramatically decreased over the study period. CONCLUSIONS Universal masking, reinforcement of hand hygiene, and PPE with medical masks for patients' care allowed protection of HCWs and containment of the outbreak. Residual transmissions were related to persistent exposures with undiagnosed patients or colleagues and not to contacts with children attending out-of-home care facilities.","Contejean, Adrien; Leporrier, Jérémie; Canouï, Etienne; Alby-Laurent, Fanny; Lafont, Emmanuel; Beaudeau, Lauren; Parize, Perrine; Lecieux, Fabienne; Greffet, Agnès; Chéron, Gérard; Gauzit, Rémy; Fourgeaud, Jacques; L'Honneur, Anne-Sophie; Tréluyer, Jean-Marc; Charlier, Caroline; Casetta, Anne; Frange, Pierre; Leruez-Ville, Marianne; Rozenberg, Flore; Lortholary, Olivier; Kernéis, Solen",Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America,190,23

Supraspinal and spinal excitability were assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex and transmastoid electrical stimulation (TMES) of the corticospinal tract, respectively. Motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) elicited by TMS and cervicomedullary motor-evoked potentials (CMEPs) elicited by TMES were recorded at two positions during arm cycling corresponding to mid-elbow flexion and mid-elbow extension (i.e., 6 and 12 o'clock made relative to a clock face, respectively). Arm cycling was performed at combinations of two cadences (60 and 90 rpm) at three relative power outputs (20, 40, and 60% peak power output). At the 6 o'clock position, BB MEPs increased ~11.5% as cadence increased and up to ~57.2% as power output increased ( P < 0.05). In the TB, MEPs increased ~15.2% with cadence ( P = 0.013) but were not affected by power output, while CMEPs increased with cadence (~16.3%) and power output (up to ~19.1%, P < 0.05). At the 12 o'clock position, BB MEPs increased ~26.8% as cadence increased and up to ~96.1% as power output increased ( P < 0.05), while CMEPs decreased ~29.7% with cadence ( P = 0.013) and did not change with power output ( P = 0.851). In contrast, TB MEPs were not different with cadence or power output, while CMEPs increased ~12.8% with cadence and up to ~23.1% with power output ( P < 0.05). These data suggest that the ""type"" of intensity differentially modulates supraspinal and spinal excitability in a manner that is phase- and muscle dependent. NEW & NOTEWORTHY There is currently little information available on how changes in locomotor intensity influence excitability within the corticospinal pathway. This study investigated the effects of arm cycling intensity (i.e., alterations in cadence and power output) on corticospinal excitability projecting to the biceps and triceps brachii during arm cycling. We demonstrate that corticospinal excitability is modulated differentially by cadence and power output and that these modulations are dependent on the phase and the muscle examined.","Lockyer, E J; Benson, R J; Hynes, A P; Alcock, L R; Spence, A J; Button, D C; Power, K E",Journal of neurophysiology,190,33

In this study, to help develop novel antiviral strategies, single-particle cryo-electron microscopy was applied to investigate viruses associated with SD. The results not only revealed the structure of mud crab dicistrovirus (MCDV) but also identified a novel mud crab tombus-like virus (MCTV) not previously detected using molecular biology methods. The structure of MCDV at a 3.5-Å resolution reveals three major capsid proteins (VP1 to VP3) organized into a pseudo-T=3 icosahedral capsid, and affirms the existence of VP4. Unusually, MCDV VP3 contains a long C-terminal region and forms a novel protrusion that has not been observed in other dicistrovirus. Our results also reveal that MCDV can release its genome via conformation changes of the protrusions when viral mixtures are heated. The structure of MCTV at a 3.3-Å resolution reveals a T= 3 icosahedral capsid with common features of both tombusviruses and nodaviruses. Furthermore, MCTV has a novel hydrophobic tunnel beneath the 5-fold vertex and 30 dimeric protrusions composed of the P-domains of the capsid protein at the 2-fold axes that are exposed on the virion surface. The structural features of MCTV are consistent with a novel type of virus.IMPORTANCE Pathogen identification is vital for unknown infectious outbreaks, especially for dual or multiple infections. Sleeping disease (SD) in crabs causes great economic losses to aquaculture worldwide. Here we report the discovery and identification of a novel virus in mud crabs with multiple infections that was not previously detected by molecular, immune, or traditional electron microscopy (EM) methods. High-resolution structures of pathogenic viruses are essential for a molecular understanding and developing new disease prevention methods. The three-dimensional (3D) structure of the mud crab tombus-like virus (MCTV) and mud crab dicistrovirus (MCDV) determined in this study could assist the development of antiviral inhibitors. The identification of a novel virus in multiple infections previously missed using other methods demonstrates the usefulness of this strategy for investigating multiple infectious outbreaks, even in humans and other animals.","Gao, Yuanzhu; Liu, Shanshan; Huang, Jiamiao; Wang, Qianqian; Li, Kunpeng; He, Jian; He, Jianguo; Weng, Shaoping; Zhang, Qinfen",Journal of virology,190,1

Anogenital psoriasis has been associated with significant quality of life impairments, but little is known about specific patient needs/treatment goals. This study aimed to examine the overall and sex-related disease burden, patient needs and treatment benefits in patients with anogenital psoriasis, compared to patients with psoriasis not affecting the anal/genital areas. Within the cross-sectional nationwide survey, 2,009 participants were consecutively recruited in 157 randomly assigned German dermatology practices and clinics, according to the following inclusion criteria aged 18 years or over; diagnosis of psoriasis vulgaris; ability to answer the questionnaires; and written informed consent. Based on a high-resolution grid on the topical distribution of psoriasis, two groups were formed: anogenital psoriasis (n = 622) and comparison group (n = 1,303). Clinical severity was assessed by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI). Patients completed the EuroQoL visual analogue scale (EQ VAS), the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), and the Patient Benefit Index (PBI). Patients with anogenital psoriasis had higher PASI (13.0±10.6 vs. 8.9±7.6, P < 0.001) and more DLQI impairments (8.9±6.9 vs. 7.0±6.2, P = 0.002) than controls. At the item-level, they also reported more sex-related DLQI impairments (DLQI-i9: 0.5±0.8 vs. 0.3±0.7, P < 0.001) and treatment needs (PBI-i17: 2.2±1.8 vs. 1.9±1.8, P = 0.001). A great percentage of missing/not-relevant responses was found for sex-related items (23.3-41.9%). These results suggest that the assessment of sex-related impairments and treatment needs should be prioritised in patients with anogenital psoriasis. Questionnaires may be used as a less uncomfortable way for patients to discuss their genital lesions and sexual function during healthcare visits. However, the great percentage of missing/not-relevant responses to sex-related items calls for in-depth assessments and effective patient-physician communication regarding these sensitive topics.","da Silva, Neuza; Augustin, Matthias; Langenbruch, Anna; Mrowietz, Ulrich; Reich, Kristian; Thaçi, Diamant; Boehncke, Wolf-Henning; Kirsten, Natalia; Danckworth, Alexandra; Sommer, Rachel",PloS one,190,30

We investigate private psychiatrists' uptake of telehealth, and face-to-face consultations for April-September 2020 for the state of Victoria, which experienced two consecutive waves of COVID-19. We compare these to the same 6 months in 2019. METHOD MBS-item-consultation data were extracted for video, telephone and face-to-face consultations with a psychiatrist for April-September 2020 and compared to face-to-face consultations in the same period of 2019 Victoria-wide, and for all of Australia. RESULTS Total Victorian psychiatry consultations (telehealth and face-to-face) rose by 19% in April-September 2020 compared to 2019, with telehealth comprising 73% of this total. Victoria's increase in total psychiatry consultations was 5% higher than the all-Australian increase. Face-to-face consultations in April-September 2020 were only 46% of the comparative 2019 consultations. Consultations of less than 15 min duration (87% telephone and 13% video) tripled in April-September 2020, compared to the same period last year. Video consultations comprised 41% of total telehealth provision: these were used mainly for new patient assessments and longer consultations.

Recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1 expressing SPA, SPB and SPC was constructed and introduced into Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells by transfection. Following the detection of PEDV infection in transfected MDCK cells after PEDV challenge, we clearly demonstrated that the SPC subdomain plays a key role in cell entry of PEDV and its expression permits PEDV growth in transfected MDCK cells, while virus propagation can be inhibited by anti-SPC serum, indicating that the SPC subdomain appears to be a crucial functional domain in contributing to efficient PEDV infection.","Shan, Zhifu; Yin, Jiyuan; Wang, Zongying; Chen, Peipei; Li, Yijing; Tang, Lijie",The Journal of general virology,190,30

METHODS Seventy-five HIV-positive men who have sex with men (MSM) were recruited. Participants answered the Spanish versions of three Likert-type scales: HSS-21, Robsenberg's self-esteem scale, and the abbreviated version of the Zung's Depression Scale. RESULTS HSS-21 showed high reliability and validity; its factor structure included four components: concern with public attitudes; negative self-image; disclosure concerns; and enacted stigma. The level of stigma was high in 27 out of 75 (36%) participants; nevertheless, the score found in the component related to disclosure concerns indicated high level of stigma in 68% of participants. The score of HSS-21 was positively correlated with the score of depression and negatively correlated with the score of self-esteem. CONCLUSION Results demonstrated high reliability for the HSS-21; correlations with other scales supported its validity. This scale demonstrated to be a practical tool for assessing stigma among Mexican HIV-positive MSM. High level of stigma was found only in the factor related to disclosure concerns. POLICY IMPLICATIONS Identifying HIV-associated stigma through a short, reliable, and validated instrument will allow the development of interventions that cope and manage stigma in HIV-positive MSM. HSS-21 distinguishes between different dimensions of stigma and will contribute to a better understanding of this phenomenon.","Valle, Adrian; Treviño, Ana Cecilia; Zambrano, Farith Francisco; Urriola, Karla Elizabeth; Sánchez, Luis Antonio; Elizondo, Jesus Eduardo",Frontiers in public health,190,12

The search for a novel fast-vegetative propagation technique to accelerate its coverage on mine tailings is a promising research area for sustainable mine closure plans. In this study, we determined the optimal proportion of compost and tailings as growing media to promote fast B. linearis propagation through a compound layering technique. The assessed growing substrates were: 100% tailings, 70% tailings + 30% compost, and 50% tailings + 50% compost. After 84 days of growth, the change in number and height of layering branches, root and shoot dry mass, percentage of ground coverage, and substrate chemical properties were assessed. The main results showed that compound layering of B. linearis is possible with compost addition. The growth of new roots and layering branches was significantly improved by either 30% or 50% compost addition into tailings, due to chemical improvements of substrate (higher nutrients and pH and decreased copper bioavailability). The study confirms that the compound layering of B. linearis may be an effective and novel technique for speeding the reclamation of post-operative mine tailings, which is improved by the incorporation of compost.","Ginocchio, Rosanna; de la Fuente, Luz María; Orrego, Fabiola; Díaz, María José; Báez, Javiera; Ovalle, Juan Francisco",International journal of phytoremediation,190,16

One hundred and ten patients scheduled for ambulatory laryngeal microsurgery under general anesthesia were randomly divided into two groups, group S1 and group D1. Patients in the group D1 were injected with 0.2 mg/kg of intravenous dexamethasone before the induction of anesthesia. The incidences and severities of sore throat were measured using verbal rating scale (VRS) at 1 h and through phone calls at 6 h after the operation. The patients who requested analgesics in the recovery room were measured VRS shortly before administration of medicine. The patients in group S1 and group D1 who did not receive rescue analgesics were enrolled in group S6 and group D6, respectively, and evaluated 6 h after the surgery. There were no significant differences in the incidence and severity scores of sore throat during 1 h after the end of operation between group S1 and group D1. But at 6 h, the patients in the group D6 had lower incidence of sore throat than those in group S6 significantly (P = 0.003). Furthermore, the patients in the group D6 had lower severity of sore throat than those in group S6 significantly at 6 h (P = 0.001).

However, a lack of host cells has resulted in poor progress in clarifying iridovirus behavior. We investigated the crucial events during virus entry using a combination of single-virus tracking and biochemical assays, based on the established virus-cell infection model for Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV). SGIV infection in host cells was strongly inhibited when cells were pretreated with drugs blocking clathrin-mediated endocytosis, including sucrose and chlorpromazine. Inhibition of key regulators of macropinocytosis, including Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, Rac1 GTPase, p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), protein kinase C (PKC), and myosin II, significantly reduced SGIV uptake. Cy5-labeled SGIV particles were observed to colocalize with clathrin and macropinosomes. In contrast, disruption of cellular cholesterol by methyl-β-cyclodextrin and nystatin had no effect on virus infection, suggesting that SGIV entered grouper cells via the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway and macropinocytosis but not via caveola-dependent endocytosis. Furthermore, inhibitors of endosome acidification such as chloroquine and bafilomycin A1 blocked virus infection, indicating that SGIV entered cells in a pH-dependent manner. In addition, SGIV particles were observed to be transported along both microtubules and actin filaments, and intracellular SGIV motility was remarkably impaired by depolymerization of microtubules or actin filaments. The results of this study for the first time demonstrate that not only the clathrin-dependent pathway but also macropinocytosis are involved in fish DNA enveloped virus entry, thus providing a convenient tactic for exploring the life cycle of DNA viruses. IMPORTANCE Virus entry into host cells is critically important for initiating infections and is usually recognized as an ideal target for the design of antiviral strategies. Iridoviruses are large DNA viruses which cause serious threats to ecological diversity and the aquaculture industry worldwide. However, the current understanding of iridovirus entry is limited and controversial. Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) is a novel marine fish DNA virus which belongs to genus Ranavirus, family Iridoviridae. Here, using single-virus tracking technology in combination with biochemical assays, we investigated the crucial events during SGIV entry and demonstrated that SGIV entered grouper cells via the clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway in a pH-dependent manner but not via caveola-dependent endocytosis. Furthermore, we propose for the first time that macropinocytosis is involved in iridovirus entry. Together, this work not only contributes greatly to understating iridovirus pathogenesis but also provides an ideal model for exploring the behavior of DNA viruses in living cells.","Wang, Shaowen; Huang, Xiaohong; Huang, Youhua; Hao, Xian; Xu, Haijiao; Cai, Mingjun; Wang, Hongda; Qin, Qiwei",Journal of virology,190,10

It examines indicators across five broad domains: climate change impacts, exposures and vulnerability; adaptation, planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co-benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement. In the wake of the unprecedented and catastrophic 2019-20 Australian bushfire season, in this special report we present the 2020 update, with a focus on the relationship between health, climate change and bushfires, highlighting indicators that explore these linkages. In an environment of continuing increases in summer maximum temperatures and heatwave intensity, substantial increases in both fire risk and population exposure to bushfires are having an impact on Australia's health and economy. As a result of the ""Black Summer"" bushfires, the monthly airborne particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5 ) concentrations in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory in December 2019 were the highest of any month in any state or territory over the period 2000-2019 at 26.0 μg/m3 and 71.6 μg/m3 respectively, and insured economic losses were $2.2 billion. We also found growing awareness of and engagement with the links between health and climate change, with a 50% increase in scientific publications and a doubling of newspaper articles on the topic in Australia in 2019 compared with 2018. However, despite clear and present need, Australia still lacks a nationwide adaptation plan for health. As Australia recovers from the compounded effects of the bushfires and the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the health profession has a pivotal role to play. It is uniquely suited to integrate the response to these short term threats with the longer term public health implications of climate change, and to argue for the economic recovery from COVID-19 to align with and strengthen Australia's commitments under the Paris Agreement.","Zhang, Ying; Beggs, Paul J; McGushin, Alice; Bambrick, Hilary; Trueck, Stefan; Hanigan, Ivan C; Morgan, Geoffrey G; Berry, Helen L; Linnenluecke, Martina K; Johnston, Fay H; Capon, Anthony G; Watts, Nick",The Medical journal of Australia,190,5

However, the impact of RRT in living-donor liver transplantation (LDLT) has not been well investigated. The aim of this study was to elucidate risk factors requiring RRT and prognostic factors after its induction. METHODS Clinical data on the consecutive 113 adult patients who underwent LDLT from March 2002 to May 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. They were divided into 2 groups: RRT (n = 33) and Non-RRT (n = 80). The primary reasons for receiving RRT were hepatorenal syndrome (n = 17), sepsis (n = 12), and renal hypoperfusion (n = 4). RESULTS Although there were no significant differences in age or sex, the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score was significantly higher in the RRT group than in the Non-RRT group (23 ± 13 vs 16 ± 7; P = .002). The graft-recipient weight ratio (GRWR) was significantly lower in the RRT group (0.86 ± 0.3 vs 0.99 ± 0.2; P = .025). The 1- and 5-year patient survival rates were significantly higher in the Non-RRT group than in the RRT group (respectively, 91.3% and 84.3% vs 42.9% and 25.5%; P < .001). In multivariate analysis, independent risk factors for receiving RRT were MELD score >20 (P = .044) and GRWR <0.7 (P = .039). In the RRT group, donor age >50 years (P = .042) and preoperative serum creatinine level >1.5 mg/dL (P = .049) were significant prognostic risk factors.

METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed on 30 patients with CNPBS refractory to drug therapy, who underwent SPB between 2017-2019. The following parameters were analyzed: basal pain, pain at 24 hours, 1 week and at 1 month. The Mann-Whitney test was applied. Statistical significance was considered at the level of p < 0.05. All statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 20. RESULTS 3 patients were excluded. At 24 hours, we report pain improvement (at least 30% reduction on basal pain score) on 20 patients and after 1 week on 12. At 1 month after, 22 patients had improved, from these: 11 improved with no therapeutic adjustment; 11 patients improved with therapeutic adjustment (8 in gabapentinoid monotherapy, 3 with introduction of polytherapy). 5 patients didn't improve. CONCLUSIóN: Our study demonstrated SPB as a valid alternative for CNPBS management when pharmacologic therapy has been proven insufficient, with no side effects reported. Randomized studies are needed to assess the magnitude of SPB on CNPBS and to identify the patients who benefit the most from SPB.","Dos Santos Rodrigues da Silva, M J; Lousame, A A; Ferreira, M L N; Fernandez Gacio, M; Miranda, M L C",Revista espanola de anestesiologia y reanimacion,190,1

Objective To determine the association between perioperative hsTnT measurements and 30-day mortality and potential diagnostic criteria for MINS (ie, myocardial injury due to ischemia associated with 30-day mortality). Design, Setting, and Participants Prospective cohort study of patients aged 45 years or older who underwent inpatient noncardiac surgery and had a postoperative hsTnT measurement. Starting in October 2008, participants were recruited at 23 centers in 13 countries; follow-up finished in December 2013. Exposures Patients had hsTnT measurements 6 to 12 hours after surgery and daily for 3 days; 40.4% had a preoperative hsTnT measurement. Main Outcomes and Measures A modified Mazumdar approach (an iterative process) was used to determine if there were hsTnT thresholds associated with risk of death and had an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 3.0 or higher and a risk of 30-day mortality of 3% or higher. To determine potential diagnostic criteria for MINS, regression analyses ascertained if postoperative hsTnT elevations required an ischemic feature (eg, ischemic symptom or electrocardiography finding) to be associated with 30-day mortality. Results Among 21 842 participants, the mean age was 63.1 (SD, 10.7) years and 49.1% were female. Death within 30 days after surgery occurred in 266 patients (1.2%; 95% CI, 1.1%-1.4%). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that compared with the reference group (peak hsTnT <5 ng/L), peak postoperative hsTnT levels of 20 to less than 65 ng/L, 65 to less than 1000 ng/L, and 1000 ng/L or higher had 30-day mortality rates of 3.0% (123/4049; 95% CI, 2.6%-3.6%), 9.1% (102/1118; 95% CI, 7.6%-11.0%), and 29.6% (16/54; 95% CI, 19.1%-42.8%), with corresponding adjusted HRs of 23.63 (95% CI, 10.32-54.09), 70.34 (95% CI, 30.60-161.71), and 227.01 (95% CI, 87.35-589.92), respectively. An absolute hsTnT change of 5 ng/L or higher was associated with an increased risk of 30-day mortality (adjusted HR, 4.69; 95% CI, 3.52-6.25). An elevated postoperative hsTnT (ie, 20 to <65 ng/L with an absolute change ≥5 ng/L or hsTnT ≥65 ng/L) without an ischemic feature was associated with 30-day mortality (adjusted HR, 3.20; 95% CI, 2.37-4.32). Among the 3904 patients (17.9%; 95% CI, 17.4%-18.4%) with MINS, 3633 (93.1%; 95% CI, 92.2%-93.8%) did not experience an ischemic symptom. Conclusions and Relevance Among patients undergoing noncardiac surgery, peak postoperative hsTnT during the first 3 days after surgery was significantly associated with 30-day mortality. Elevated postoperative hsTnT without an ischemic feature was also associated with 30-day mortality.","Devereaux, P J; Biccard, Bruce M; Sigamani, Alben; Xavier, Denis; Chan, Matthew T V; Srinathan, Sadeesh K; Walsh, Michael; Abraham, Valsa; Pearse, Rupert; Wang, C Y; Sessler, Daniel I; Kurz, Andrea; Szczeklik, Wojciech; Berwanger, Otavio; Villar, Juan Carlos; Malaga, German; Garg, Amit X; Chow, Clara K; Ackland, Gareth; Patel, Ameen; Borges, Flavia Kessler; Belley-Cote, Emilie P; Duceppe, Emmanuelle; Spence, Jessica; Tandon, Vikas; Williams, Colin; Sapsford, Robert J; Polanczyk, Carisi A; Tiboni, Maria; Alonso-Coello, Pablo; Faruqui, Atiya; Heels-Ansdell, Diane; Lamy, Andre; Whitlock, Richard; LeManach, Yannick; Roshanov, Pavel S; McGillion, Michael; Kavsak, Peter; McQueen, Matthew J; Thabane, Lehana; Rodseth, Reitze N; Buse, Giovanna A Lurati; Bhandari, Mohit; Garutti, Ignacia; Jacka, Michael J; Schünemann, Holger J; Cortes, Olga Lucía; Coriat, Pierre; Dvirnik, Nazari; Botto, Fernando; Pettit, Shirley; Jaffe, Allan S; Guyatt, Gordon H",JAMA,190,1

Multiple streams framework explains how the intersection of problems, policy, and politics streams influence policy adoption. Policy entrepreneurs work on joining these streams. Interviews (n = 20) were conducted with stakeholders (e.g., physicians/researchers/nonprofit organizations' leaders). Data were analyzed using applied thematic analysis. High incidence of HPV and HPV-related cancers in Puerto Rico were indicators of problems. Focusing events included Rhaiza's case and the HPV-Advisory Panel Report. During summer 2017, a policy window opened; the Department of Health (DOH) adopted the requirement in summer 2018. Stakeholders discussed policy initiatives. Political turnover positively influenced the process. Policy entrepreneurs created an extended period of intersection resulting in the adoption of the requirement.

103031,103031,103031,A case report of successful permanent pacemaker implantation via the iliac vein.,14.980629,10.468992,2016,"BACKGROUND The control of diabetes mellitus (DM) should help reduce the incidence of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) concentration is usually undertaken at fixed time-points. Therefore, the extent of postoperative blood glucose fluctuation might be underestimated. To provide a more comprehensive assessment, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is beginning to be used. However, no previous studies have evaluated blood glucose concentrations using CGM following orthopedic surgery. Therefore, the differences between the maximum blood glucose concentrations measured using SMBG and CGM, and the mean amplitude of the glycemic fluctuation in patients with frank diabetes mellitus (DM) or pre-diabetes were evaluated. Blood glucose was measured in 20 patients who had undergone total hip or total knee arthroplasty (12 patients with DM and eight with pre-diabetes). Patients were fitted with a CGM device in the operating room, which was worn for 6 days postoperatively, and used to evaluate blood glucose concentration continuously. SMBG was performed simultaneously for the same period. RESULTS The mean difference between the maximum blood glucose concentrations measured using SMBG and CGM was 25.0 ± 20.3 mg/dl (range, - 17 to 81 mg/dl), with the concentrations measured using CGM tending to be higher than those measured using SMBG (P = 0.04). Blood glucose concentrations measured using CGM tended to be higher than those measured using SMBG until postoperative day 2, and to decrease gradually after postoperative day 4. There were no significant differences in the standard deviation of the blood glucose concentrations between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS Blood glucose concentrations > 200 mg/dl and larger fluctuations were more frequently recorded using CGM than SMBG, especially until postoperative day 2. Thus, CGM is more useful for the identification of high blood glucose concentrations and larger fluctuations. However, this information was not provided in real time.","Maeda, Yuki; Nakamura, Nobuo; Tsujimoto, Takashi; Sugano, Nobuhiko",Journal of experimental orthopaedics,190,1

Several LARPs have been characterized for their distinct activity in a specific aspect of RNA metabolism. The La-modules vary among the LARPs in linker length and RRM subtype. The La-modules of La protein and LARP7 bind and protect nuclear RNAs with UUU-3' tails from degradation by 3' exonucleases. LARP4 is a mRNA poly(A) stabilization factor that binds poly(A) and the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein PABPC1 (also known as PABP). LARP1 exhibits poly(A) length protection and mRNA stabilization similar to LARP4. Here, we show that these LARP1 activities are mediated by its La-module and dependent on a PAM2 motif that binds PABP. The isolated La-module of LARP1 is sufficient for PABP-dependent poly(A) length protection and mRNA stabilization in HEK293 cells. A point mutation in the PAM2 motif in the La-module impairs mRNA stabilization and PABP binding in vivo but does not impair oligo(A) RNA binding by the purified recombinant La-module in vitro. We characterize the unusual PAM2 sequence of LARP1 and show it may differentially affect stable and unstable mRNAs. The unique LARP1 La-module can function as an autonomous factor to confer poly(A) protection and stabilization to heterologous mRNAs.","Mattijssen, Sandy; Kozlov, Guennadi; Gaidamakov, Sergei; Ranjan, Amitabh; Fonseca, Bruno D; Gehring, Kalle; Maraia, Richard J",RNA biology,190,7

METHODS We conducted a retrospective study among patients who underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy between February 2008 and August 2012. The parameters evaluated were age, BMI, operative time, hospital stay, pre- and postoperative hemoglobin levels, uterine weight, intraoperative blood loss, and postoperative complications. RESULTS A total of 202 women underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy; barbed suture (V-Loc) was used in 63 women, and polydioxanone (PDS) in 139. Estimated blood loss, difference in hemoglobin level before and after surgery, operative time, and the duration of hospital stay were comparable between the two groups of patients. The incidence of postoperative fever was higher in the V-Loc group than in the PDS group (P = 0.003). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the incidence of postoperative fever was related to BMI (P = 0.02, r = 0.22) and estimated blood loss (P = 0.004, r = 0.28) and not to age, operative time, or uterine weight. CONCLUSION The use of barbed suture to close the vaginal vault after laparoscopic hysterectomy, compared with standard suture, results in similar operative time, blood loss, and duration of hospital stay. The use of barbed suture is technically less demanding than the use of regular sutures.","Bassi, Ali; Tulandi, Togas",Journal of obstetrics and gynaecology Canada : JOGC = Journal d'obstetrique et gynecologie du Canada : JOGC,190,17

Prior research has focused on perceptions of sexual harassment targeting straight cisgender women. We examined how targets' sexual orientation and gender identity impact these perceptions. In three preregistered studies, straight cisgender participants imagined a coworker confided that a male colleague had sexually harassed her. The target was a transgender woman, a lesbian woman, or a woman whose sexual orientation and gender identity were unspecified. In Study 1 (N = 428), participants reported believing that sexual harassment targeting lesbians and women with unspecified identities was most likely motivated by attraction and power, whereas sexual harassment targeting transgender women was seen as most likely motivated by power and prejudice. Despite these differences in perceived motivation, in Study 2 (N = 421) perceptions of appropriate consequences for the perpetrator did not vary based on the target's identity. Study 3 (N = 473) demonstrated that the specific behavior of which sexual harassment is assumed to consist differs based on the target's identity. Whereas women with unspecified identities and lesbians were assumed to face stereotypical attraction-based harassment, transgender women were assumed to face gender harassment. Stereotypes about sexual harassment can bias third-party assumptions, invalidating experiences that do not match pervasive stereotypes.

The effect of specific improvements is not well known. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of specific workflow improvements on time to treatment and outcome. Methods- A random-effects meta-analysis was used to evaluate the difference in mean time to treatment between intervention group and control group. Secondary outcomes included good functional outcome at 90 days (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2). Results- Fifty-one studies (3 randomized controlled trials, 13 prepost intervention studies, and 35 observational studies) with in total 8467 patients were included. Most frequently reported workflow intervention types concerned anesthetic management (n=26), in-hospital patient transfer management (n=14), and prehospital management (n=11). Patients in the intervention group had shorter time to treatment intervals (weighted mean difference, 26 minutes; 95% CI, 19-33; P<0.001) compared with controls. Subgroup meta-analysis of intervention types also showed a shorter time to treatment in the intervention group: a mean difference of 12 minutes (95% CI, 6-17; P<0.001) for anesthetic management, 37 minutes (95% CI, 22-52; P<0.001) for prehospital management, 41 minutes (95% CI, 27-54; P<0.001) for in-hospital patient transfer management, 47 minutes (95% CI, 28-67; P<0.001) for teamwork, and 64 minutes (95% CI, 24-104; P=0.002) for feedback. The mean difference in time to treatment of studies with multiple interventions implemented simultaneously was 50 minutes (95% CI, 31-69; P<0.001) in favor of the intervention group. Patients in the intervention group had increased likelihood of favorable outcome (risk ratio [RR], 1.39; 95% CI, 1.15-1.66; P<0.001). Conclusions- Interventions in the workflow of endovascular stroke treatment lead to a significant reduction in time to treatment and results in an increased likelihood of favorable outcome. Acute stroke care should be reorganized by making use of the examples of workflow interventions described in this review to ensure the best medical care for stroke patients.","Janssen, Paula M; Venema, Esmee; Dippel, Diederik W J",Stroke,190,29

This study investigated if the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity findings for SAR-Asp versus NN-Asp, observed over 6 months in people with type 1 (T1D, n=497) or type 2 diabetes (T2D, n=100) treated with multiple daily injections in combination with insulin glargine (Lantus®), are maintained after 12 months. MATERIALS AND METHODS GEMELLI 1 was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase 3 study. Participants completing the initial 6-month treatment period continued on SAR-Asp or NN-Asp, as randomized, for a 6-month safety extension. RESULTS Of 597 participants randomized, 264/301 (87.7%) and 263/296 (88.9%) assigned to SAR-Asp and NN-Asp, respectively, completed 12 months of treatment. Improved glycemic control was sustained at 12 months in both treatment groups, with similar least squares mean reductions in HbA1c from baseline (SAR-Asp -0.25%; NN-Asp -0.26%). Fasting plasma glucose and seven-point self-monitored plasma glucose profile changes, including postprandial glucose excursions, and changes in mealtime and basal insulin dosages were similar between groups. Safety and tolerability, including anti-insulin aspart antibodies (AIA; incidence, prevalence, titers, cross-reactivity to human insulin), neutralizing antibodies (incidence, prevalence), hypoglycemia, treatment-emergent adverse events (including hypersensitivity events and injection site reactions), were similar between groups. No relationship was observed between maximum individual AIA titers and change in HbA1c or insulin dose, hypoglycemia, or hypersensitivity reactions or between efficacy/safety measures and subgroups by presence or absence of treatment-emergent AIA. CONCLUSIONS SAR-Asp and NN-Asp demonstrated similar efficacy and safety (including immunogenicity) in people with diabetes over 12 months treatment.","Garg, Satish K; Wernicke-Panten, Karin; Wardecki, Marek; Kramer, Daniel; Delalande, Francois; Franek, Edward; Sadeharju, Karita; Monchamp, Travis; Miossec, Patrick; Mukherjee, Bhaswati; Shah, Viral N",Diabetes technology & therapeutics,190,24

To assess outcome and safety of 571 hybrid natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) cholecystectomies. Methods. We retrospectively analyzed all consecutive NOTES cholecystectomies performed at our center between June 2009 and January 2018. All procedures were performed using a hybrid transvaginal technique, including an umbilical small-size trocar. End points, calculated at discharge, 30 and up to 90 days postoperatively, included intra- and postoperative morbidity assessed by the validated Clavien-Dindo classification and the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI). Special focus was held on outcome and necessity of pre- and postoperative gynecological examinations. Results. We performed 571 hybrid NOTES cholecystectomies within 9 years. The vast majority were elective, 9.6% were emergency cholecystectomies. 6.7% of patients developed at least one complication until discharge, most of them minor (≤grade II). 30- and 90-day complication rates were 10.7% and 11%, respectively. Mean CCI at discharge and postoperative days 30 and 90 was 1.45 (±6.4), 2.3 (±7.7), and 2.4 (±7.8), respectively. Major complications (≥grade IIIa) occurred in 1.6% of patients, and 4 patients required emergency reoperation. No mortality was observed. In 9.8%, an additional abdominal trocar was placed. All patients underwent routine gynecological examination, whereof only 5 were rejected for transvaginal access preoperatively. In no case transvaginal access was discontinued intraoperatively due to gynecological disease. Conclusion. Hybrid NOTES transvaginal cholecystectomy represents a safe and feasible alternative to standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Preoperative gynecological examination is no longer routinely necessary, as intraoperative assessment is adequate.","Rössler, Fabian; Keerl, Andreas; Bieri, Uwe; Slieker, Juliette; Nocito, Antonio",Surgical innovation,190,27

Our purpose was to evaluate the frequency and relevance of these events in mTE of M1 occlusions. MATERIALS AND METHODS We retrospectively reviewed all patients treated for isolated M1 occlusion between January 2008 and July 2012. Angiographic images were analyzed to assess emboli in anterior cerebral artery branches induced by mTE and associated devices. Recanalization attempts in the ACA were reported as well as technical success and adverse events of rescue therapies. ACA infarcts on follow-up imaging served as a surrogate for clinical relevance. ACA infarcts were quantified volumetrically and assessed visually for involvement of motor or supplementary motor areas. RESULTS New ACA emboli occurred in 12 of 105 (11.4%) M1 recanalization procedures and were caused by a stent-retriever in 11 intances. Attempts to recanalize the ACA were made in 6 patients and were deemed technically successful in 5 with no adverse events. We detected 6 (5.7%) new infarcts on follow-up imaging with an average volume of 26.9 cm(3). Involvement of motor or supplementary motor areas was seen in 4 (3.8%) cases. Three patients developed ACA infarcts despite successful endovascular ACA recanalization. CONCLUSIONS The frequency of ACA emboli in mTE of M1 occlusions is relevant, causing ACA infarcts in 5.7% of patients; 3.8% of emboli were likely to hamper motor-function recovery. Endovascular recanalization of major ACA branches reduced the incidence of infarcts with no adverse events.","Kurre, W; Vorlaender, K; Aguilar-Pérez, M; Schmid, E; Bäzner, H; Henkes, H",AJNR.

The score includes anatomical extent of DVT; body mass index; and baseline Villalta score. OBJECTIVE To externally validate the SOX-PTS score. METHODS Logistic regression analysis of data from the ATTRACT Trial which evaluated pharmacomechanical catheter directed thrombolysis in patients with proximal DVT. The primary outcome was the occurrence of PTS (defined as Villalta score ≥ 5) from 6 to 24 months after DVT. Secondary outcomes included moderate-severe PTS (Villalta scale ≥ 10) and severe PTS (Villalta scale ≥ 14). Predictive performance was assessed by discrimination and calibration. An updated score was evaluated in an exploratory analysis. RESULTS 691 ATTRACT patients were included, of whom 328 (47%) developed PTS. The c-statistic was 0.63; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59-0.67 for PTS. The model's performance appeared to be better for the outcomes moderate to severe PTS and severe PTS (c-statistic 0.67; 95% CI 0.62 to 0.72 for moderate-severe PTS and 0.70; 0.64 to 0.77 for severe PTS). An updated model with age as an additional variable performed similarly to the original model. CONCLUSION We externally validated the SOX-PTS score for estimating the risk of developing PTS, moderate to severe PTS, and severe PTS, in patients with proximal DVT. The score may be useful to predict PTS at the time of DVT diagnosis. Further external validation in different patient cohorts is required.","Rabinovich, Anat; Gu, Chu-Shu; Vedantham, Suresh; Kearon, Clive; Goldhaber, Samuel Z; L Gornik, Heather; Kahn, Susan R",Journal of thrombosis and haemostasis : JTH,190,20

MATERIALS AND METHODS This retrospective study comprised 15 years (1997-2012). INCLUSION CRITERIA all patients who received CAE. EXCLUSION CRITERIA patients who died before complete healing and patients who received exclusively cultured allogeneic keratinocytes. Evaluation criteria were clinical. Time and success of wound healing after CAE graft were evaluated. RESULTS A total of 63 patients were included with severity Baux score of 107 (from 70 to 140) and mean percentage of TBSA of 71% (from 40% to 97%). The CAE were used as Cuono method, in STSG donor sites and deep 2nd degree burns and in combination with large-meshed STSG (1:6-1:12) in extensively burned patients. Cuono method was used in 6 patients. The final take was 16% (0-30) because of the great fragility of the obtained epidermis. Nine patients with deep 2nd degree burns (mean TBSA 81%, from 60 to 97%) were successfully treated with only CAE without skin grafting. Combined technique (STSG meshed at 1:6-1:12 covered with CAE) was used in 27 patients (mean TBSA 69%, from 49% to 96%) with 85% success rate. Finally, donor sites treated with CAE in 49 patients could be harvested several times thanks to rapid epithelialization (time of wound healing was 7 days (from 5 to 10 days)). CONCLUSION The CAE allow rapid healing of STSG donor sites and deep 2nd second degree burns in extensively burned patients.","Auxenfans, Celine; Menet, Veronique; Catherine, Zulma; Shipkov, Hristo; Lacroix, Pierre; Bertin-Maghit, Marc; Damour, Odile; Braye, Fabienne",Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries,190,16

Spike (S) glycoprotein in the SARS-CoV-2 virus is pivotal in understanding the virus anatomy, since it initiates the early contact with the ACE2 receptor in the human cell. The subunit S1 in chain A of S-protein has four structural domains: the receptor binding domain (RBD), the n-terminal domain (NTD) and two subdomains (SD1, SD2). We report details of the intra- and inter-molecular binding mechanism of RBD using density functional theory, including electronic structure, interatomic bonding and partial charge distribution.

The ability to quantify these tractions is important in understanding and manipulating these processes. Three-dimensional traction force microscopy (3DTFM) provides reliable means of evaluating cellular tractions by first measuring the displacement of fluorescent beads in response to these tractions in the surrounding matrix, and then using this measurement to compute the tractions. However, most applications of 3DTFM assume that the surrounding extra-cellular matrix (ECM) is non-fibrous, despite the fact that in many natural and synthetic environments the ECM contains a significant proportion of fibrous components. Motivated by this, we develop a computational approach for determining tractions, while accounting for the fibrous nature of the ECM. In particular, we make use of a fiber-based constitutive model in which the stress contains contributions from a distribution of nonlinear elastic fibers and a hyperelastic matrix. We solve an inverse problem with the nodal values of the traction vector as unknowns, and minimize the difference between a predicted displacement field, obtained by solving the equations of equilibrium in conjunction with the fiber-based constitutive model, and the measured displacement field at the bead locations. We employ a gradient-based minimization method to solve this problem and determine the gradient efficiently by solving for the appropriate adjoint field. We apply this algorithm to problems with experimentally observed cell geometries and synthetic, albeit realistic, traction fields to gauge its sensitivity to noise, and quantify the impact of using an incorrect constitutive model: the so-called model error. We conclude that the approach is robust to noise, yielding about 10% error in tractions for 5% displacement noise. We also conclude that the impact of model error is significant, where using a nonlinear exponential hyperelastic model instead of the fiber-based model, can lead to more than 100% error in the traction field. These results underline the importance of using appropriate constitutive models in 3DTFM, especially in fibrous ECM constructs.","Song, Dawei; Hugenberg, Nicholas; Oberai, Assad A",Computer methods in applied mechanics and engineering,190,31

MATERIALS AND METHODS Our retrospective study was approved by the Institutional Review Board. Between January 2006 and December 2013, 290 patients (82 women, 208 men; mean age, 64.5 years; range, 33-89 years) with 474 subcapsular (within 1 cm to the liver surface) HCCs (mean size, 23.7 mm; range, 6-71 mm) underwent percutaneous thermal ablation. The HCCs were divided into surface contact group (n = 243) and non-surface contact group (n = 231). The former was further subdivided into exophytic and non-exophytic HCCs. Technical success, primary technique efficacy, local tumor progression (LTP), and secondary technique efficacy rates were analyzed and compared by the chi-square test or Fisher exact test. Prognostic factors for LTP and secondary technique efficacy were assessed using the Cox regression model. Major complications were also assessed. RESULTS With median follow-up of 15 months (range, 1-87 months), technical success and primary technique efficacy were 98.7% and 95.7% % in the non-surface contact group; 96.4% and 94.0% in the non-exophytic group; and 100% and 94.7% in the exophytic group (p > 0.05). Tumor size > 3 cm was a significant predictor for LTP, but not for secondary efficacy. Overall major complication rate was 3.8% (24/624) and was not different among the three groups. CONCLUSION Subcapsular HCCs can be effectively treated with thermal ablation techniques. Degree of tumor-surface contact including moderate protrusion does not appear to limit feasibility or procedure effectiveness. KEY POINTS • Subcapsular HCCs can be effectively treated with thermal therapy when proper image-guided technique and assistive techniques are applied. • Degree of tumor surface contact including moderate protrusion does not appear to limit feasibility or procedure effectiveness. • Major complications after percutaneous thermal ablation of subcapsular HCCs such as tumor seeding can be minimized by avoiding breach of the tumor capsule exposed to the peritoneal surface and use of tract ablation.","Worakitsitisatorn, Akeanong; Lu, David S; Lee, Min Woo; Asvadi, Nazanin H; Moshksar, Amin; Yuen, Alexander D; McWilliams, Justin; Raman, Steven S",European radiology,190,1

The authors report their experience with TAMIS for the treatment of mid and high rectal tumors. METHODS From November 2011 through May 2016, 31 patients (21 females, 68%), with a median age of 65 years who underwent single-port TAMIS were prospectively enrolled. Mean distance from the anal verge of the rectal tumors was 9.5 cm. Seventeen patients presented with T1 cancer, 10 with large adenoma, 2 with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and 2 with carcinoid tumor. Data concerning demographics, operative procedure and pathologic results were analyzed. RESULTS TAMIS was successfully completed in all cases. In 4 (13%) TAMIS was converted to standard Park's transanal technique. Median postoperative stay was 3 days. The overall complication rate was 9.6%, including 1 urinary tract infection, 1 subcutaneous emphysema, and 1 hemorrhoidal thrombosis. TAMIS allowed an R0 resection in 96.8% of cases (30/31 cases) and a single case of local recurrence after a large adenoma resection was encountered. CONCLUSION TAMIS is a safe technique, with a short learning curve for laparoscopic surgeons already proficient in single-port procedures, and provides effective oncological outcomes compared to other techniques.","Quaresima, Silvia; Balla, Andrea; Franceschilli, Luana; La Torre, Marco; Iafrate, Corrado; Shalaby, Mostafa; Di Lorenzo, Nicola; Sileri, Pierpaolo",JSLS : Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons,190,0

However, over the past decade, numerous studies have shown that innate immune cells can also retain memory of these encounters. This process, called innate immune memory is mediated by metabolic and epigenetic changes that make cells either hyperresponsive (trained immunity) or hyporesponsive (tolerance) to subsequent challenges.

However, it is difficult to accurately estimate the population densities of P. infestans in soil, especially Japanese soil. In the present study, P. infestans DNA was extracted from soil samples using a modified CTAB-bead method and quantified using real-time PCR to accurately, rapidly and easily estimate the P. infestans population densities in upland soils in Japan. P. infestans was well quantified in eleven types of soil samples, including nine types of upland soils in Japan, that were artificially inoculated with a zoosporangia suspension. The amounts of P. infestans DNA estimated by the real-time PCR were proportional to the inoculum densities. In the non-controlled experimental potato field, P. infestans population densities in soil corresponded to the development of symptoms and were correlated with the number of lesions on the potato foliage. These results imply that the proposed real-time PCR assay is suitable for the estimation or monitoring of P. infestans population densities in upland soils in Japan. The population densities at the ridge bottoms were larger than those at any other location in commercial potato fields. These results were similar to those of a previous report using a bioassay. Moreover, a correlation between DNA quantity and inoculum potential was observed. In conclusion, the real-time PCR assay developed in this study is suitable for indirect estimation of the inoculum potential of P. infestans.","Osawa, Hisashi; Suzuki, Nobuyuki; Akino, Seishi; Araki, Hiromichi; Asano, Kenji; Akai, Kotaro; Kondo, Norio",Scientific reports,190,20

Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed by two authors independently. A meta-analysis was performed using the random-effects model. Sixty studies (n = 1449) were eligible for statistical analysis estimating an overall HPV prevalence of 25.5% (95% CI 20.7-31.0). When stratified by HPV detection method, prevalence with multiple substrate testing (20.5%, 95% CI 14.5-28.2) was lower than with single substrate testing (31.7%, 95% CI 23.6-41.1), highest in high-exposure anatomic subsites (nasal cavity and ethmoids) (37.6%, 95% CI 26.5-50.2) vs. low-exposure (15.1%, 95% CI 7.3-28.6) and highest in high HPV+ OPSCC prevalence geographic regions (North America) (30.9%, 95% CI 21.9-41.5) vs. low (Africa) (13.1, 95% CI 6.5-24.5)). While small sample sizes and variability in data cloud firm conclusions, here, we provide a new reference point prevalence for HPV in SNSCC along with orthogonal data supporting a causative role for virally driven tumorigenesis, including that HPV is more commonly found in sinonasal subsites with increased exposure to refluxed oropharyngeal secretions and in geographic regions where HPV+ OPSCC is more prevalent.","Chang Sing Pang, Kim J W; Mur, Taha; Collins, Louise; Rao, Sowmya R; Faden, Daniel L",Cancers,190,0

METHODS Inpatient admissions from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project National Inpatient Sample and State Inpatient Databases were analyzed for packed red blood cell (PRBC), plasma, platelet, and whole blood (WB) transfusions. The transfusion rates per admission and per prevalent case were calculated. Prevalence estimates were from the Global Burden of Disease 2017 study (GBD). RESULTS From 2000 to 2014, blood usage rates for most causes peaked around 2010. Across all causes, PRBC were the most commonly transfused component, followed by plasma, platelets, and WB. However, the relative use of each type varied by cause. Nutritional deficiencies (1.75 blood product units across all components per admission; 95 % uncertainty interval (UI) 1.62-1.87), neoplasms (0.95; 0.87-1.04), and injuries (0.92; 0.86 - 0.98) had the greatest blood use per admission. Cardiovascular diseases (96.9 units per 1000 prevalent cases; 89.3-105.0) and neoplasms (92.7 units per 1000 prevalent cases; 84.3-101.5) had the greatest blood use per prevalent case. Across all admissions, over three million blood units were saved in 2014 compared to 2011 due to transfusing at a reduced rate. CONCLUSIONS Blood transfusion rates decreased from 2011 to 2014 in the United States. This decline occurred in most disease categories, which points towards broad strategies like patient blood management systems and disease specific improvements like changes in surgical techniques being effective.","Roberts, Nicholas; James, Spencer L; Delaney, Meghan; Fitzmaurice, Christina",Transfusion and apheresis science : official journal of the World Apheresis Association : official journal of the European Society for Haemapheresis,190,28

METHODS All attendees to the 2012 annual meeting had the opportunity to complete an immediate postmeeting questionnaire as part of their continuing medical education (CME) certification in which they identified up to two learning themes, answered questions related to potential practice change items that are based on those learning themes, and complete a needs assessment related to important learning topics for future meetings. In addition, participants in the postgraduate and hands-on courses were asked to complete questions about case volume and comfort levels related to procedures/topics in those courses. All respondents to this initial survey were sent a 3-month follow-up questionnaire in which they were asked how successfully they had implemented the intended practice changes and what, if any, barriers they encountered. Postgraduate and hands-on course participants completed case volume and comfort level questions. Descriptive statistical analysis of this deidentified data was undertaken. RESULTS Response rates were 42% and 56% for CME-eligible attendees/respondents for the immediate postmeeting and 3-month follow-up questionnaires, respectively. Top learning themes for respondents were Bariatric, Hernia, Foregut, and Colorectal.

Here we examined the relationship between trait aggression as measured by Buss and Warren's Aggression Questionnaire and personality traits measured with Big Five Questionnaire-Children in 77 primary-school children, and recorded resting-state brain activity (fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations, fALFF) and functional connectivity (rsFC) using functional magnetic resonance imaging. The present results showed that trait aggression was negatively correlated with agreeableness and positively correlated with neuroticism. The brain analyses showed that children with a higher propensity for aggression had a lower fALFF mainly in the left superior temporal gyrus, right parahippocampal gyrus, and left supramarginal gyrus. Physical and total aggression were negatively associated with rsFC between the right parahippocampal gyrus and the right putamen. Further analysis revealed that this rsFC could moderate the influence of neuroticism on total aggression. Moreover, the results suggest the presence of a sex difference in the neurodevelopmental mechanisms underlying aggression in middle childhood. Overall, our findings indicate that aggressive children have lower agreeableness and higher neuroticism, and the underlying neural systems are mainly implicated in social judgment and empathy.","Li, Qingqing; Xiao, Mingyue; Song, Shiqing; Huang, Yufei; Chen, Ximei; Liu, Yong; Chen, Hong",Social cognitive and affective neuroscience,190,0

OBJECTIVE This integrative review aimed to synthesize the literature on the mental health, mental health treatment, and traumatic experiences of currently and formerly incarcerated mothers. METHODS We searched PsychINFO, CINAHL, and Criminal Justice Abstracts for all research articles that were written in English; included adult mothers who were incarcerated or incarcerated and released; and contained findings related to mental health, mental health treatment, or traumatic experiences. RESULTS Thirty-four articles met the inclusion criteria. Mothers had high rates of moderate-to-severe mental health problems and high childhood and adult trauma rates, especially intimate partner violence. Mothers faced barriers to treatment yet showed psychological resilience and active coping skills. IMPLICATIONS Nurses can recognize risk factors for women's incarceration and assess mental health symptoms and trauma, especially interpersonal violence. Nurses can use assessment findings to refer mothers to treatment and community resources and support their reuniting with their children. Nurses can also provide trauma-informed care and education about mental health topics and advocate for mental health treatment prerelease and postrelease. Staff education and organizational interventions to reduce burnout may remove additional barriers to care.","Stanton, Ann E; Rose, Susan J",Journal of forensic nursing,190,7

MATERIALS AND METHODS Surgeons performed intracorporeal sutures with various instruments within three different cylindrical workspace sizes. Three pairs of instruments were compared: 3-mm non-robotic mini-laparoscopy instruments; 5-mm robotic instruments; and 8-mm robotic instruments. Workspace diameters were 4, 6 and 8 cm, with volumes of 50, 113 and 201 cm(3) respectively. Primary outcomes were validated objective task performance scores and instrument workspace breach counts. RESULTS A total of 23 participants performed 276 suture task repetitions. The overall median task performance scores for the 3-, 5- and 8-mm instruments were 421, 398 and 402, respectively (P = 0.12). Task scores were highest (best) for the 3-mm non-robotic instruments in all workspace sizes. Scores were significantly lower when spatial constraints were imposed, with median task scores for the 4-, 6- and 8-cm diameter workspaces being 388, 415 and 420, respectively (P = 0.026). Significant indirect relationships were seen between boundary breaches and workspace size (P < 0.001). Higher breach counts occurred with the robotic instruments. CONCLUSIONS Smaller workspaces limit the performance of both robotic and non-robotic instruments. In operating workspaces <200 cm(3) , 3-mm non-robotic instruments are better suited for advanced bimanual operative tasks such as suturing. Future robotic instruments need further optimization if this technology is to be uniquely advantageous for clinical roles that involve endoscopic access to workspace-restricted anatomical areas.","Cundy, Thomas P; Marcus, Hani J; Hughes-Hallett, Archie; MacKinnon, Thomas; Najmaldin, Azad S; Yang, Guang-Zhong; Darzi, Ara",BJU international,190,20
118593,118593,118593,Rapid delayed growth of ruptured supraclinoid blister aneurysm after successful flow diverting stent treatment.,14.644892,10.629162,2016,"Background Infusion sets designed for peristaltic finger smart pumps (PFSPs) are necessary for the pumps' accurate handling. We previously found that medication dispensing is occasionally incomplete following the calculated infusion time when using certain combinations of PFSPs and infusion sets at a Japanese hospital. Thus, in this study, we investigated the cause of this observed delay by determining the effect of infusion set attachment technique on dispensing time using a combination of three kinds of PFSPs and five kinds of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polybutadiene (PB) infusion sets. Methods PFSPs with their exclusive infusion sets were used. The PVC and PB infusion sets were either not stretched or stretched to 1-3 cm and attached to the PFSP's liquid delivery system. PFSP dispensing rates were set at 25-400 mL/h. The primary outcome was the time required to dispense 100 mL of saline in a volumetric flask. Results The complete dispensing time correlated with the input time for all equipment combinations when the infusion sets were not stretched before attachment to the PFSP (R2 = 0.9998-1.0000). When stretched, the complete dispensing time was longer than the input time (P < 0.01-0.05, analysis of variance with Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons). The maximum dispensing time extension ratio for the PVC and PB infusion sets was 141.8% and 113.0%, respectively. Conclusion Certain attachment techniques for infusion sets can adversely prolong drug dispensing time. As such, pharmacists should provide medical staff with information about the devices used to administer drugs, as well as about the drugs themselves.","Umemura, Masayuki; Maegawa, Kanae; Arai, Daichi; Shigeno, Katsuro; Wakiya, Yoshifumi",Journal of pharmaceutical health care and sciences,190,20

Since access to high-intensity care units is restricted, it is necessary both to promptly diagnose patients who are at risk of rapid clinical deterioration or death and to define criteria to identify the correct allocation of patients based on clinical-care needs. Although the so-called ""early warning scores"" were used by healthcare professionals to alert medical staff, nowadays, they can also be used as decision rules for managing patient admissions, increasing their effective usefulness. The procedure for assessing the complexity of care profiles needs to be based on a multidisciplinary approach. The primary objective of scientific research was to determine the intensity of care (clinical instability and care dependence) of the patients allocated in different settings of the medical area. To correctly frame the phenomenon, the main methods and strategies developed for different care models were discussed. In the Italian healthcare organization, the indicators, methodologies and tools to evaluate the clinical-care complexity were identified and subsequently applied.

In humans, there are five RECQ helicase genes, and mutations in three of them-BLM, WRN, and RECQL4-are associated with the genetic disorders Bloom syndrome, Werner syndrome, and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (RTS), respectively. Importantly all three diseases are cancer predisposition syndromes. Patients with RTS are highly and uniquely susceptible to developing osteosarcoma; thus, RTS provides a good model to study the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma. The ""tumor suppressor"" role of RECQL4 and the other RECQ helicases is an area of active investigation. This chapter reviews what is currently known about the cellular functions of RECQL4 and how these may relate to tumorigenesis, as well as ongoing efforts to understand RECQL4's functions in vivo using animal models.

DESIGN Longitudinal study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS The study included participants from a community in a semiurban area of Japan. We conducted a mailed questionnaire survey of 2000 noninstitutionalized older adults who were randomly sampled. Of those who completed both the baseline and follow-up surveys in March and October 2020, respectively, participants aged ≥70 years without cognitive impairment at baseline were included in the analysis. METHODS Participants were classified into 4 groups based on their baseline and follow-up social isolation status, which were as follows: ""remained nonisolated,"" ""isolated from nonisolation,"" ""nonisolated from isolation,"" and ""consistent isolation."" Self-reported cognitive function was assessed using the Cognitive Performance Scale, and level 2 (mild impairment) or higher (moderate to severe impairment) was defined as cognitive impairment. RESULTS Ultimately, 955 older adults were analyzed. The mean age of the participants was 79.6 years (standard deviation = 4.7) and 54.7% were women. During the follow-up period, 54 (5.7%) participants developed cognitive impairment. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that compared with the group that remained nonisolated, the isolated from nonisolation and consistent isolation groups were significantly associated with the onset of cognitive impairment [isolated from nonisolation: odds ratio (OR) = 2.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.13-6.61, P = .026; consistent isolation: OR = 2.33, 95% CI = 1.07-5.05, P = .033]. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS Social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a decline in cognitive function among older adults. Attention to the social isolation process during the pandemic may be necessary to protect older adults' cognitive health.","Noguchi, Taiji; Kubo, Yuta; Hayashi, Takahiro; Tomiyama, Naoki; Ochi, Akira; Hayashi, Hiroyuki",Journal of the American Medical Directors Association,190,8

An empirical study is promptly needed to reliably assess the causal effects of the mobility restriction. The purpose of this study was to quantify the causal effects of human mobility restriction on the spread of COVID-19. METHODS Our study applied the difference-in-difference (DID) model to assess the declines of population mobility at the city level, and used the log-log regression model to examine the effects of population mobility declines on the disease spread measured by cumulative or new cases of COVID-19 over time after adjusting for confounders. RESULTS The DID model showed that a continual expansion of the relative declines over time in 2020. After 4 weeks, population mobility declined by -54.81% (interquartile range, -65.50% to -43.56%). The accrued population mobility declines were associated with the significant reduction of cumulative COVID-19 cases throughout 6 weeks (ie, 1% decline of population mobility was associated with 0.72% [95% CI: 0.50%-0.93%] reduction of cumulative cases for 1 week, 1.42% 2 weeks, 1.69% 3 weeks, 1.72% 4 weeks, 1.64% 5 weeks, and 1.52% 6 weeks). The impact on the weekly new cases seemed greater in the first 4 weeks but faded thereafter. The effects on cumulative cases differed by cities of different population sizes, with greater effects seen in larger cities. CONCLUSIONS Persistent population mobility restrictions are well deserved. Implementation of mobility restrictions in major cities with large population sizes may be even more important.","Tan, Jing; Zhao, Shao-Yang; Xiong, Yi-Quan; Liu, Chun-Rong; Huang, Shi-Yao; Lu, Xin; Thabane, Lehana; Xie, Feng; Sun, Xin; Li, Wei-Min",Chinese medical journal,190,24

While most approaches to therapy are using repurposed drugs that were developed for other diseases, it is thought that targeting the biology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, can result in an effective therapeutic treatment. The coronavirus RNA cap structure is methylated by two viral methyltransferases that transfer methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). The proper methylation of the virus depends on the level of methionine in the host to form SAM. Herein, we propose to restrict methionine availability by treating the patient with oral recombinant methioninase, aiming to treat Covid-19. By restricting methionine we not only interdict viral replication, which depends on the viral RNA cap methyaltion, but also inhibit the proliferation of the infected cells, which have an increased requirement for methionine. Most importantly, the virally-induced T-cell- and macrophage-mediated cytokine storm, which seems to be a significant cause for Covid-19 deaths, can also be inhibited by restricting methionine, since T-cell and macrophrage activation greatly increases the methionine requirement for these cells. The evidence reviewed here suggests that oral recombinant methioninase could be a promising treatment for coronavirus patients.","Hoffman, Robert M; Han, Qinghong",In vivo,190,1

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and multiple others have been reminders that structural racism persists and restricts the opportunities for long, healthy lives of Black Americans and other historically disenfranchised groups. The American Heart Association has previously published statements addressing cardiovascular and cerebrovascular risk and disparities among racial and ethnic groups in the United States, but these statements have not adequately recognized structural racism as a fundamental cause of poor health and disparities in cardiovascular disease. This presidential advisory reviews the historical context, current state, and potential solutions to address structural racism in our country. Several principles emerge from our review: racism persists; racism is experienced; and the task of dismantling racism must belong to all of society. It cannot be accomplished by affected individuals alone. The path forward requires our commitment to transforming the conditions of historically marginalized communities, improving the quality of housing and neighborhood environments of these populations, advocating for policies that eliminate inequities in access to economic opportunities, quality education, and health care, and enhancing allyship among racial and ethnic groups. Future research on racism must be accelerated and should investigate the joint effects of multiple domains of racism (structural, interpersonal, cultural, anti-Black).

The incidence and evolution of PASC are dependent on time from infection, organ systems and tissue affected, vaccination status, variant of the virus, and geographic region. Objective To estimate organ system-specific frequency and evolution of PASC. Evidence Review PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, the World Health Organization Global Literature on Coronavirus Disease, and CoronaCentral databases were searched from December 2019 through March 2021. A total of 2100 studies were identified from databases and through cited references. Studies providing data on PASC in children and adults were included. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for abstracting data were followed and performed independently by 2 reviewers. Quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies. The main outcome was frequency of PASC diagnosed by (1) laboratory investigation, (2) radiologic pathology, and (3) clinical signs and symptoms. PASC were classified by organ system, ie, neurologic; cardiovascular; respiratory; digestive; dermatologic; and ear, nose, and throat as well as mental health, constitutional symptoms, and functional mobility. Findings From a total of 2100 studies identified, 57 studies with 250 351 survivors of COVID-19 met inclusion criteria. The mean (SD) age of survivors was 54.4 (8.9) years, 140 196 (56%) were male, and 197 777 (79%) were hospitalized during acute COVID-19. High-income countries contributed 45 studies (79%). The median (IQR) proportion of COVID-19 survivors experiencing at least 1 PASC was 54.0% (45.0%-69.0%; 13 studies) at 1 month (short-term), 55.0% (34.8%-65.5%; 38 studies) at 2 to 5 months (intermediate-term), and 54.0% (31.0%-67.0%; 9 studies) at 6 or more months (long-term). Most prevalent pulmonary sequelae, neurologic disorders, mental health disorders, functional mobility impairments, and general and constitutional symptoms were chest imaging abnormality (median [IQR], 62.2% [45.8%-76.5%]), difficulty concentrating (median [IQR], 23.8% [20.4%-25.9%]), generalized anxiety disorder (median [IQR], 29.6% [14.0%-44.0%]), general functional impairments (median [IQR], 44.0% [23.4%-62.6%]), and fatigue or muscle weakness (median [IQR], 37.5% [25.4%-54.5%]), respectively. Other frequently reported symptoms included cardiac, dermatologic, digestive, and ear, nose, and throat disorders. Conclusions and Relevance In this systematic review, more than half of COVID-19 survivors experienced PASC 6 months after recovery. The most common PASC involved functional mobility impairments, pulmonary abnormalities, and mental health disorders. These long-term PASC effects occur on a scale that could overwhelm existing health care capacity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.","Groff, Destin; Sun, Ashley; Ssentongo, Anna E; Ba, Djibril M; Parsons, Nicholas; Poudel, Govinda R; Lekoubou, Alain; Oh, John S; Ericson, Jessica E; Ssentongo, Paddy; Chinchilli, Vernon M",JAMA network open,190,29

The Apicomplexa, important pathogens of humans causing diseases such as toxoplasmosis and malaria, depend on their mETC in every known stage of their complicated life cycles. Here, using a complexome profiling proteomic approach, we have characterised the Toxoplasma mETC complexes and F1Fo-ATP synthase. We identified and assigned 60 proteins to complexes II, IV and F1Fo-ATP synthase of Toxoplasma, of which 16 have not been identified previously. Notably, our complexome profile elucidates the composition of the Toxoplasma complex III, the target of clinically used drugs such as atovaquone. We identified two new homologous subunits and two new parasite-specific subunits, one of which is broadly conserved in myzozoans. We demonstrate all four proteins are essential for complex III stability and parasite growth, and show their depletion leads to decreased mitochondrial potential, supporting their assignment as complex III subunits. Our study highlights the divergent subunit composition of the apicomplexan mETC and F1Fo-ATP synthase complexes and sets the stage for future structural and drug discovery studies.","Maclean, Andrew E; Bridges, Hannah R; Silva, Mariana F; Ding, Shujing; Ovciarikova, Jana; Hirst, Judy; Sheiner, Lilach",PLoS pathogens,190,1

Regarding the clinical implications of genetic information, little is known about the lifelong clinical effect of sarcomere mutations in Japanese HCM patients.Methods and Results:We studied 211 consecutive Japanese patients with HCM who had agreed to genetic testing between 2003 and 2013. Genetic analyses were performed by direct DNA sequencing in the 6 common sarcomere genes (MYH7,MYBPC3,TNNT2,TNNI3,TPM1,ACTC). Through variant filtering, 21 mutations were identified in 67 patients. After excluding 8 patients whose variants were determined as having uncertain significance, finally 203 patients (130 men, age at study entry: 61.8±14.1 years) were investigated for clinical presentation and course. At the time of study entry, patients with mutations were younger, had more frequent non-sustained ventricular tachycardia, had greater interventricular wall thickness, were more frequently in the dilated phase and less frequently had apical HCM. Through their lifetimes, a total of 98 HCM-related morbid events occurred in 72 patients. Survival analysis revealed that patients with sarcomere gene mutations experienced those morbid events significantly more frequently, and this tendency was more prominent for lethal arrhythmic events. CONCLUSIONS In our HCM cohort, patients with sarcomere gene mutations had poorer lifelong outcome. Genetic information is considered important for better management of HCM.","Nakashima, Yasuteru; Kubo, Toru; Sugiura, Kenta; Ochi, Yuri; Takahashi, Asa; Baba, Yuichi; Hirota, Takayoshi; Yamasaki, Naohito; Kimura, Akinori; Doi, Yoshinori L; Kitaoka, Hiroaki",Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society,190,15

To avoid harm for patients without large vessel occlusion from delayed access to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), it has been suggested to only redirect patients with high likelihood of large vessel occlusion for whom the additional delay to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) caused by transport to the CSC is below a certain threshold. However, which threshold achieves the greatest clinical benefit is unknown. Methods- We used mathematical modeling to calculate additional-delay-to-IVT thresholds associated with the greatest reduction in disability-adjusted life years in abstracted 2-stroke center and multiple-stroke center scenarios. Model parameters were extracted from recent meta-analyses or large prospective cohort studies. Uncertainty was quantified in probabilistic and 2-way univariate sensitivity analyses. Results- Assuming ideal treatment time performance metrics, transport to the nearest CSC was the preferred strategy irrespective of additional delay-to-IVT when the transfer time between primary stroke center and CSC was <40 minutes (95% credible interval: 25-66 minutes); otherwise, the optimal additional delay-to-IVT-threshold ranged from 28 to 139 minutes. In multiple-stroke center scenarios, optimal additional-delay-to-IVT thresholds were 30 to 54 minutes in urban and 49 to 141 minutes in rural settings; use of optimal thresholds as compared with a 15 minute-threshold saved 0 to 0.11 and 0 to 0.37 disability-adjusted life years per triage case, respectively. Assuming slower treatment times at primary stroke centers and CSCs yielded longer permissible additional delays. Conclusions- Our results suggest that patients with acute ischemic stroke with suspected large vessel occlusion should be redirected to a CSC if the additional delay to IVT is <30 minutes in urban and 50 minutes in rural settings.","Schlemm, Ludwig; Endres, Matthias; Nolte, Christian H",Stroke,190,23

BACKGROUND Women are at increased risk of bleeding and vascular complications after PCI. The role of radial access in women is unclear. METHODS Women undergoing cardiac catheterization or PCI were randomized to radial or femoral arterial access. Data from the CathPCI Registry and trial-specific data were merged into a final study database. The primary efficacy endpoint was Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 2, 3, or 5 bleeding or vascular complications requiring intervention. The primary feasibility endpoint was access site crossover. The primary analysis cohort was the subgroup undergoing PCI; sensitivity analyses were conducted in the total randomized population. RESULTS The trial was stopped early for a lower than expected event rate. A total of 1,787 women (691 undergoing PCI) were randomized at 60 sites. There was no significant difference in the primary efficacy endpoint between radial or femoral access among women undergoing PCI (radial 1.2% vs. 2.9% femoral, odds ratio [OR]: 0.39; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.12 to 1.27); among women undergoing cardiac catheterization or PCI, radial access significantly reduced bleeding and vascular complications (0.6% vs. 1.7%; OR: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.12 to 0.90). Access site crossover was significantly higher among women assigned to radial access (PCI cohort: 6.1% vs. 1.7%; OR: 3.65; 95% CI: 1.45 to 9.17); total randomized cohort: (6.7% vs. 1.9%; OR: 3.70; 95% CI: 2.14 to 6.40). More women preferred radial access. CONCLUSIONS In this pragmatic trial, which was terminated early, the radial approach did not significantly reduce bleeding or vascular complications in women undergoing PCI. Access site crossover occurred more often in women assigned to radial access.

The LHS uses routine data from service delivery and patient care to generate knowledge to continuously improve healthcare. The aim of this project was to explore key features of a successful and sustainable LHS to inform implementation in an Academic Health Science Centre context. METHODS We purposively identified and conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews with leaders, experienced in supporting or developing data driven innovations in healthcare. A thematic analysis using NVivo was undertaken. RESULTS Analysis of 26 interviews revealed five themes thought to be integral in an effective, sustainable LHS: (1) Systematic approaches and iterative, continuous learning with implementation into healthcare contributing to new best-practice care; (2) Broad stakeholder, clinician and academic engagement, with collective vision, leadership, governance and a culture of trust, transparency and co-design; (3) Skilled workforce, capability and capacity building; (4) Resources with sustained investment over time and; (5) Data access, systems and processes being integral to a sustainable LHS. CONCLUSIONS This qualitative study provides insights into the elements of a sustainable LHS across a range of leaders in data-driven healthcare improvement. Fundamentally, an LHS requires continuous learning with implementation of new evidence back into frontline care to improve outcomes. Structure, governance, trust, culture, vision and leadership were all seen as important along with a skilled workforce and sustained investment. Processes and systems to optimise access to quality data were also seen as vital in an effective, sustainable LHS. These findings will inform a co-designed framework for implementing a sustainable LHS within the Australian healthcare and Academic Health Science Centre context. It is anticipated that application of these findings will assist to embed and accelerate the use of routine health data to continuously generate new knowledge and ongoing improvement in healthcare delivery and health outcomes.","Enticott, Joanne; Braaf, Sandra; Johnson, Alison; Jones, Angela; Teede, Helena J",BMC health services research,190,1

In this review, we present the uptake of preprint server use in nephrology and discuss specific considerations regarding preprint server use in medicine. Distribution of kidney-related research on preprint servers is rising at an exponential rate. Survey of nephrology journals identified that 15 of 17 (88%) are publishing original research accepted submissions that have been uploaded to preprint servers. After reviewing 52 clinically impactful trials in nephrology discussed in the online Nephrology Journal Club (NephJC), an average lag of 300 days was found between study completion and publication, indicating an opportunity for faster research dissemination. Rapid review of papers discussing benefits and risks of preprint server use from the researcher, publisher, or end user perspective identified 53 papers that met criteria. Potential benefits of biomedical preprint servers included rapid dissemination, improved transparency of the peer review process, greater visibility and recognition, and collaboration. However, these benefits come at the risk of rapid spread of results not yet subjected to the rigors of peer review. Preprint servers shift the burden of critical appraisal to the reader. Media may be especially at risk due to their focus on ""late-breaking"" information. Preprint servers have played an even larger role when late-breaking research results are of special interest, such as during the global coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Coronavirus disease 2019 has brought both the benefits and risks of preprint servers to the forefront. Given the prominent online presence of the nephrology community, it is poised to lead the medicine community in appropriate use of preprint servers.","Vlasschaert, Caitlyn; Giles, Cameron; Hiremath, Swapnil; Lanktree, Matthew B",Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN,190,28

Particularly because emergency nurses have contact with patients on the front line, they experience ethical problems in nursing while struggling with infectious diseases in an unfavorable environment. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to explore emergency nurses' ethical problems and to identify factors influencing these problems during the outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus in Korea. DESIGN AND SAMPLE For this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire survey was conducted with emergency nurses working in six hospitals selected through convenience sampling from the hospitals designated for Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus patients in the capital area. METHODS Data were collected from 169 emergency nurses in Korea during August 2015. Ethical considerations: This research was approved by the Institutional Review Board of G University in Korea. RESULTS The findings of this study suggest that during the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus outbreak, emergency nurses experienced ethical problems tied to a mind-set of avoiding patients. Three factors were found to influence emergency nurses' ethical problems (in order of influence): cognition of social stigmatization, level of agreement with infection control measures, and perceived risk. CONCLUSION Through this study, we obtained information on emergency nurses' ethical problems during the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus outbreak and identified the factors that influence them. As found in this study, nurses' ethical problems were influenced most by cognitions of social stigmatization. Accordingly, to support nurses confidently care for people during future health disasters, it is most urgent to promote appropriate public consciousness that encourages healthcare workers.","Choi, Jeong-Sil; Kim, Ji-Soo",Nursing ethics,190,1

More recently, a buccal micronucleus cytome assay (BMCA) has been developed for use as a biomarker of DNA damage in patients with SLE. There has been a very limited number of studies pertaining to the oral lesions in Arab population suffering from SLE in Asir region. Hence, it became utmost important to study epidemiological data of oral mucosal lesions in SLE patients. Distribution of oral lesions in SLE patients could also be helpful in better management of oral complications. Aim The aim of this study was to determine the existence of a correlation between SLEDAI score and the degree of micronuclei (MN) formation using BMCA. Materials and Methods After thorough oral examination of adult Saudi SLE patients of Asir hospital and that of healthy control subjects, the subjects underwent BMCA from normal unaffected bilateral buccal mucosae. Results Pearson's correlation test showed that MN count did not significantly correlate with either disease activity or duration of SLE. Conclusions Controlled state SLE does not lead to a significant increase in MN formation. Thus, the occurrence of premalignant lesions in the oral cavity could be minimized using proper management protocols.","Assiri, Khalil; Hameed, Mohammad Shahul; Dawasaz, Ali Azhar; Alamoudi, Eman; Asiri, Alhussain Mohammad; Hitesh, Vij; Ajmal, Muhammed",Indian journal of dermatology,190,2

It is unclear whether responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines based on the prototypic strain will be impacted by mutations found in B.1.1.7. Here we assessed immune responses following vaccination with mRNA-based vaccine BNT162b22. We measured neutralising antibody responses following first and second immunisations using pseudoviruses expressing the wild-type Spike protein or the 8 amino acid mutations found in the B.1.1.7 spike protein. The vaccine sera exhibited a broad range of neutralising titres against the wild-type pseudoviruses that were modestly reduced against B.1.1.7 variant. This reduction was also evident in sera from some convalescent patients. Decreased B.1.1.7 neutralisation was also observed with monoclonal antibodies targeting the N-terminal domain (9 out of 10), the RBM (5 out of 31), but not in RBD neutralising mAbs binding outside the RBM. Introduction of the E484K mutation in a B.1.1.7 background to reflect a newly emergent Variant of Concern (VOC 202102/02) led to a more substantial loss of neutralising activity by vaccine-elicited antibodies and mAbs (19 out of 31) over that conferred by the B.1.1.7 mutations alone.

Glycoproteins are particularly challenging in this regard owing to several potential trafficking routes within the cell. By engineering a glycoprotein-derived epitope to contain an N-linked glycosylation site, we determined that optimal CD8+ T cell expansion and function were induced by the peptides that are rapidly produced from the exceedingly minor fraction of protein mislocalized to the cytosol. In contrast, peptides derived from the much larger fraction that undergoes translocation and quality control are produced with delayed kinetics and induce suboptimal CD8+ T cell responses.

This review synthesises the barriers and facilitators to engaging with and participating in physical activity whilst receiving treatment. METHODS The metasynthesis of qualitative studies is reported in line with the PRISMA statement. We systematically searched eight databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, CINAHL, British Library, OpenGrey, and Conference Proceedings Citation Index) from inception to November 30, 2017. A total of 1276 abstracts were retrieved and screened by two reviewers independently. Data from eligible studies were extracted and critically appraised. As this review concerns qualitative studies only, a CER-QUAL GRADE assessment was completed. RESULTS A total of 13 studies were included. Four clear themes emerged (side effects of treatment, beliefs about physical activity, focus on health not illness, and social factors) each containing both barriers and facilitators. Key facilitators to participating in physical activity during adjuvant treatment included positive physical benefits, improvements in psychological well-being, and increased self-esteem and empowerment. Further, having a knowledgeable instructor, tailored information, and a supportive environment were important to women undergoing treatment. Main barriers included fatigue and pain, as well as work and caring responsibilities. CONCLUSIONS Incorporating physical activity into treatment regimens is important. Focusing on being less sedentary and providing accurate, tailored information should be prioritised within future interventions. Having a supportive environment and accounting for the particular barriers or facilitators to engagement identified here should aid the success of future interventions.","Lavallée, Jacqueline F; Abdin, Shanara; Faulkner, James; Husted, Margaret",Psycho-oncology,190,1

MATERIALS AND METHODS Forty consecutive cases of MILESS-PN performed between April 2013 and November 2015 were included in this study. Mini-laparoendoscopic single-site surgery consisted of the simultaneous use of two 3-mm pararectal trocars and an umbilical SILS trocar; the sequence of steps of MILESS-PN was comparable with standard laparoscopic partial nephrectomy. Demographic data and the main perioperative and oncological outcome parameters were gathered and analyzed. RESULTS The median operative time was 134.6 (interquartile range [IQR] 110-180) minutes with a median warm ischemia time of 12.1 (IQR 9.5-15.5) minutes. Postoperatively, 4 early complications were recorded and the median hospital stay was 4.2 (IQR 3.5-6.0) days. The median renal tumor size was 3.6 (IQR 2.4-5.3) cm with a median PADUA score of 8.3 (IQR 8-9). The definitive pathologic results revealed a renal cell carcinoma in 32 cases (80%), an angiomyolipoma in 3 cases (7.5%), and an oncocytoma in 5 cases (12.5%). All tumors were removed with negative surgical margins, and at the median follow-up of 34.5 (IQR 24-48) months, all patients were alive without evidence of tumor recurrence or port-site metastasis. A statistically significant decrease in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was observed postoperatively (postoperative vs preoperative median eGFR: 87.6 [IQR 70.4-101.8] and 104.7 [IQR 82.7-123.3], P <.0001) and at 6 months (6 months vs preoperative eGFR 93.6 [IQR 79.1-110.2] and 104.7 [IQR 82.7-123.3], P <.0001). CONCLUSION MILESS-PN for renal tumors with an intermediate PADUA score in well-selected patients is not associated with increased risks for the patients, presenting excellent oncological and functional results at the midterm follow-up. Mini-laparoendoscopic single-site surgery could represent a valid alternative to laparoendoscopic single-site surgery or minilaparoscopy because of its higher surgical reproducibility.","Springer, Christopher; Kawan, Felix; La Rocca, Roberto; Mohammed, Nasreldin; Fornara, Paolo; Mirone, Vincenzo; Greco, Francesco",Urology,190,16

Although emerging artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) algorithms could reduce uncertainty surrounding these life and death decisions, certain criteria must be met to ensure their bedside value. RECENT FINDINGS Although ICU severity of illness scores have existed for decades, these tools have not been shown to predict well or to improve outcomes for individual patients. Novel AI/ML tools offer the promise of personalized ICU care but remain untested in clinical trials. Ensuring that these predictive models account for heterogeneity in patient characteristics and treatments, are not only specific to a clinical action but also consider the longitudinal course of critical illness, and address patient-centered outcomes related to equity, transparency, and shared decision-making will increase the likelihood that these tools improve outcomes. Improved clarity around standards and contributions from institutions and critical care departments will be essential. SUMMARY Improved ICU prognostication, enabled by advanced ML/AI methods, offer a promising approach to inform difficult and urgent decisions under uncertainty. However, critical knowledge gaps around performance, equity, safety, and effectiveness must be filled and prospective, randomized testing of predictive interventions are still needed.","Weissman, Gary E; Liu, Vincent X",Current opinion in critical care,190,8

However, most colorectal resections and all hand-assisted procedures require an incision either for specimen retrieval or insertion of the hand-assist device. The ideal site of this incision has not been evaluated with respect to the incidence of incisional hernia. This study compares the rates of incisional hernia associated with a standard midline laparotomy, a midline incision of reduced length, and a Pfannenstiel incision. METHODS From March 2004 to July 2007, 512 consecutive patients were identified from a prospectively maintained database according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients were divided into three groups depending on the type of incision (open, midline, and Pfannenstiel). Demographic variables, rate of incisional hernia, and risk factors for hernia were compared among the groups. RESULTS There were 142, 231, and 139 patients in the open, midline, and Pfannenstiel groups, respectively. All three groups were comparable with respect to age, gender, steroid use, diabetes, number of patients with malignancy, and duration of follow-up. The Pfannenstiel group had a higher mean BMI (p = 0.015) and the open group had a higher rate of wound infection (28.2%) compared to the other groups. Incidence of incisional hernia was similar for the open and midline groups (19.7 and 16%, p = 0.36). At a mean follow-up of 17.5 months, not a single patient with a Pfannenstiel incision developed an incisional hernia (p < 0.001). BMI (p = 0.019), follow-up (p < 0.001), and Pfannenstiel incision (p < 0.001) were found to be predictors (protectors) of incisional hernia on multivariate analysis. CONCLUSION A Pfannenstiel incision is associated with the lowest rate of incisional hernia and should be the incision of choice for hand assistance and specimen extraction in minimally invasive colorectal resections wherever applicable.","DeSouza, Ashwin; Domajnko, Bastian; Park, John; Marecik, Slawomir; Prasad, Leela; Abcarian, Herand",Surgical endoscopy,190,17

Hence, a simple, sensitive and stability-indicating reversed-phase liquid chromatographic method was developed and validated for the determination of ribavirin in the presence of its degradation products. The analysis was carried out on an ODS C18 (250 × 4.6 mm i.d.) stainless steel column using a mobile phase consisting of 0.02 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate. The analysis was performed at ambient temperature with a flow rate of 1 mL/min and UV detection at 207 nm. Pyridoxine hydrochloride was used as an internal standard. The method showed good linearity over the concentration range of 2.0-40 µg/mL with limit of detection of 0.34 µg/mL and limit of quantification of 1.03 µg/mL. The suggested method was successfully applied for the analysis of ribavirin in its commercial capsules. Statistical evaluation and comparison of the data obtained by the proposed and comparison method revealed good accuracy and precision of the proposed method. The drug was exposed to forced alkaline, acidic, oxidative and photolytic degradation according to the ICH guidelines. Moreover, the method was utilized to investigate the kinetics of alkaline and acidic degradation of the drug.

RECENT FINDINGS We identified randomized clinical trials from inception through April 2018 from MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, and hand searches. After screening 338 references, we included five trials with one post-hoc analysis that evaluated MBIs and collectively included 399 participants. Outcome instruments were heterogeneous across studies. Three studies evaluated RA clinical outcomes by a rheumatologist; one study found improvements in disease activity. A limited meta-analysis found no statistically significant difference in the levels of DAS28-CRP in the two studies that evaluated this metric (- 0.44 (- 0.99, 0.12); I2 0%). Four studies evaluated heterogeneous psychological outcomes, and all found improvements including depressive symptoms, psychological distress, and self-efficacy. A meta-analysis of pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS) levels post intervention from three included studies was not significantly different between MBI participants and control group (- 0.58 (- 1.26, 0.10); I2 0%) although other studies not included in meta-analysis found improvement. There are few trials evaluating the effect of MBIs on outcomes in patients with RA. Preliminary findings suggest that MBIs may be a useful strategy to improve psychological distress in those with RA.","DiRenzo, Dana; Crespo-Bosque, Monica; Gould, Neda; Finan, Patrick; Nanavati, Julie; Bingham, Clifton O",Current rheumatology reports,190,31

METHODS Sixty patients who underwent scheduled thoracoscopic lobectomy were randomly assigned to three groups: traditional ventilation, PV, or PVRM. Ventilations were performed using a tidal volume of 10 mL/kg for the traditional ventilation group and either 8 mL/kg (two-lung) or 6 mL/kg (one-lung, OLV) with a positive end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O for the PV and PVRM groups. The RM was performed 10 min after the start of OLV. Fiberoptic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed twice in dependent and non-dependent lungs: before the start and immediately after the end of OLV. Blood samples were collected at the same time points. The levels of cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10, were measured. RESULTS After OLV, the level of TNF-α in the BAL fluid of dependent lungs was significantly higher in the PV than in the PVRM group (P = 0.049), whereas IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 levels were not significantly different among the groups. In non-dependent lung BAL fluid, no cytokines were significantly different among the groups. After OLV, IL-10 serum levels were significantly higher in the traditional ventilation than in the PVRM group (P = 0.027). CONCLUSIONS Lower inflammatory responses in the ventilated lung and serum were observed with PVRM than with traditional ventilation or PV alone. Larger multi-center clinical trials are warranted to confirm the effects of different ventilatory strategies on postoperative outcomes.","Kim, Hyun Joo; Seo, Jeong-Hwa; Park, Kyoung-Un; Kim, Young Tae; Park, In Kyu; Bahk, Jae-Hyon",Surgical endoscopy,190,1

A structured review was conducted in PubMed, ScienceDirect, LILACS, SciELO, the Cochrane Library and Google Scholar on COVID-19 and ophthalmology. The Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine 2011 Levels of Evidence worksheet was used for quality assessments. 1018 items were identified in the search; 26 records were included in the qualitative synthesis, which encompassed 6 literature reviews, 10 case series or cross-sectional studies, 4 case reports, and 6 intervention descriptions. Seventeen out of 26 records (65%) were categorized as level 5 within the Oxford CBME methodology grading system, the rest were level 4. The evidence generated on COVID-19 and ophthalmology to date is limited, although this is understandable given the circumstances. Both the possible presence of viral particles in tears and conjunctiva, and the potential for conjunctival transmission remain controversial. Ocular manifestations are not frequent and could resemble viral infection of the ocular surface. Most recommendations are based on the strategies implemented by Asian countries during previous coronavirus outbreaks. There is a need for substantive studies evaluating these strategies in the setting of SARS-CoV-2. In the meantime, plans for applying these measures must be implemented with caution, taking into account the context of each individual country, and undergo regular evaluation.","Emparan, Juan Pablo Olivares-de; Sardi-Correa, Carolina; López-Ulloa, Juan Alberto; Viteri-Soria, Jaime; Penniecook, Jason A; Jimenez-Román, Jesús; Lansingh, Van C",Arquivos brasileiros de oftalmologia,190,1

The objective of our study was to determine the misdiagnosis rate of radiologists for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluate the performance of chest CT in the diagnosis and management of COVID-19. The CT features of COVID-19 are reported and compared with the CT features of other viruses to familiarize radiologists with possible CT patterns. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This study included the first 51 patients with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection confirmed by nucleic acid testing (23 women and 28 men; age range, 26-83 years) and two patients with adenovirus (one woman and one man; ages, 58 and 66 years). We reviewed the clinical information, CT images, and corresponding image reports of these 53 patients. The CT images included images from 99 chest CT examinations, including initial and follow-up CT studies. We compared the image reports of the initial CT study with the laboratory test results and identified CT patterns suggestive of viral infection. RESULTS. COVID-19 was misdiagnosed as a common infection at the initial CT study in two inpatients with underlying disease and COVID-19. Viral pneumonia was correctly diagnosed at the initial CT study in the remaining 49 patients with COVID-19 and two patients with adenovirus. These patients were isolated and obtained treatment. Ground-glass opacities (GGOs) and consolidation with or without vascular enlargement, interlobular septal thickening, and air bronchogram sign are common CT features of COVID-19. The The ""reversed halo"" sign and pulmonary nodules with a halo sign are uncommon CT features. The CT findings of COVID-19 overlap with the CT findings of adenovirus infection. There are differences as well as similarities in the CT features of COVID-19 compared with those of the severe acute respiratory syndrome. CONCLUSION. We found that chest CT had a low rate of missed diagnosis of COVID-19 (3.9%, 2/51) and may be useful as a standard method for the rapid diagnosis of COVID-19 to optimize the management of patients. However, CT is still limited for identifying specific viruses and distinguishing between viruses.","Li, Yan; Xia, Liming",AJR. American journal of roentgenology,190,16

PATIENTS AND METHODS We analyzed data from 167 cases, where bilateral BAL samples were tested, and from 101 cases, where BAL samples and EA were tested. Multiplex PCR was performed with the Fast Track Diagnostics viral respiratory panel, producing data on the adenovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, human metapneumovirus, bocavirus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus and respiratory syncytial virus status of patients with respiratory disease symptoms. RESULTS In the bilateral BAL cohort, 46 (27.5%) cases were positive for at least one of the viruses mentioned above in both samples. Discrepant results (virus not detected on one side) were seen in 6 (3.6%) cases. In the BAL vs EA cohort, 12 (11.9%) cases were positive in both materials, discrepant results (only one material being positive) were observed in 11 (10.9%) cases, with 7 (63.6%) BAL samples and 4 (36.4%) EA being positive. CONCLUSIONS Bilateral sampling does not significantly improve the diagnostic efficiency of BAL for the detection of common respiratory viral pathogens via PCR.

METHODS One non-absorbable barrier mesh (Composix™) and three absorbable barrier meshes (Sepramesh™, Proceed™, and Parietex™ Composite) were used for the study, with uncoated macroporous polypropylene mesh (ProLite Ultra™) as the control. Three methods of fixation were used: #0-polypropylene suture + FS (ARTISS™, Baxter Healthcare Corp.), FS alone (ARTISS™), or tacks alone (n = 10 for each group). Two pieces of mesh (of dimensions 4 × 4-cm) were secured intraperitoneally in 75 New Zealand white rabbits. After 8 weeks, hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained specimens were evaluated for host tissue response. Statistical significance (P < 0.05) was determined using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) post hoc test. RESULTS Composix™ with FS only showed significantly greater cellular infiltration than with suture + FS (P = 0.0007), Proceed™ with FS only had significantly greater neovascularization than with suture + FS (P = 0.0172), and ProLite Ultra™ with suture + FS had significantly greater neovascularization than with tacks only (P = 0.046). Differences due to mesh type showed that Composix™ exhibited less extensive cellular infiltration (P ≤ 0.0032), extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition, and neovascularization, and demonstrated less inflammatory cells and more fibroblasts compared to the other meshes (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS FS did not have a significant histologic effect compared to tacks when utilized for the fixation of mesh to the peritoneum of New Zealand White rabbits. However, the mesh type did have a significant histologic effect. The permanent barrier mesh (Composix™) was associated with less histologic incorporation than absorbable barrier and macroporous meshes, as evidenced by lower levels of cellular infiltration, ECM deposition, and neovascularization, independent of the fixation method used.","Jenkins, E D; Melman, L; Desai, S; Deeken, C R; Greco, S C; Frisella, M M; Matthews, B D",Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery,190,6

DESIGN Qualitative analysis of open-ended prompts included as part of an anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey of pregnant women in the United States. SETTING Online survey with participants from 47 states within the U.S. PARTICIPANTS Self-identified pregnant women recruited through Facebook, Twitter, and other online sources. MEASUREMENTS AND FINDINGS An anonymous, online survey of pregnant women (distributed April 3 - 24, 2020) included an open-ended prompt asking women to tell us how COVID-19 had affected their prenatal care. Open-ended narrative responses were downloaded into Excel and coded using the Attride-Sterling Framework. 2519 pregnant women from 47 states responded to the survey, 88.4% of whom had at least one previous birth. Mean age was 32.7 years, mean weeks pregnant was 24.3 weeks, and mean number of prenatal visits at the point of the survey was 6.5. Predominant themes of the open narratives included COVID-19's role in creating structural changes within the healthcare system (reported spontaneously by 2075 respondents), behavioral changes among both pregnant women and their providers (reported by 429 respondents), and emotional consequences for women who were pregnant (reported by 503 respondents) during the pandemic. Changes resulting from COVID-19 varied widely by provider, and women's perceptions of the impact on quality of care ranged from perceiving care as extremely compromised to perceiving it to be improved as a result of the pandemic. KEY CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE Women who are pregnant during the COVID-19 pandemic have faced enormous upheaval as hospitals and healthcare providers have struggled to meet the simultaneous and often competing demands of infection prevention, pandemic preparedness, high patient volumes of extremely sick patients, and the needs of 'non-urgent' pregnant patients. In some settings, women described very few changes, whereas others reported radical changes implemented seemingly overnight. While infection rates may drive variable responses, these inconsistencies raise important questions regarding the need for local, state, national, or even global recommendations for the care of pregnant women during a global pandemic such as COVID-19.","Javaid, Sarah; Barringer, Sarah; Compton, Sarah D; Kaselitz, Elizabeth; Muzik, Maria; Moyer, Cheryl A",Midwifery,190,1

Quarantine in a sense similar to modern times was used in 1377 in Ragusa, today's Dubrovnik, during the plague epidemic. It was the first administratively imposed procedure in the world's history. It was later used in Venice and other rich port cities in the Mediterranean. On the territory of today's Poland, quarantine measures were used by the so-called Mayor of the Air - LukaszDrewno in 1623 during the plague epidemic in Warsaw. The quarantine left its mark on all areas of human activity. It affected all humanity in a way that is underestimated today. Throughout history, it has been described and presented visually. It is omnipresent in the world literature, art and philosophy. However, the isolation and closure of cities, limiting trade, had an impact on the economic balance, and the dilemma between the choice of inhabitants' health and the quality of existence, i.e. their wealth, has been the subject of discussions since the Middle Ages. Since the end of the 19th century, quarantine has lost its practical meaning. The discovery of bacteria and a huge development of medical and social sciences allowed limiting its range. In the 20th century isolation and quarantine no longer had a global range, because the ability to identify factors causing the epidemic, knowledge about the incubation period, carrier, infectiousness, enabled the rational determination of its duration and territorial range. The modern SARS COV 2 pandemic has resulted in a global quarantine on a scale unprecedented for at least three hundred years. The aim of this paper is to present the history of quarantine from its beginning to the present day, including its usefulness as an epidemiological tool.","Paliga, Renata E",Przeglad epidemiologiczny,190,12

The reaction has been shown to proceed through the addition of O2 in the ortho-position in the five-membered ring of C13H9. At low temperatures, the reaction yields a collisionally stabilized C13H9O2 complex, which rapidly decomposes back to the reactants. In the high-temperature regime, above 800, 900, 1125, and 1375 K at pressures of 0.03, 1, 10, and 100 atm, respectively, the reaction forms bimolecular products including 3H-/1H-cyclopenta[a]naphthalen-3-one + OH as the prevailing product together with 1-ethanol-substituted 2-naphthyl radical + CO and 3H-benzo[f]chromen-3-one + H as minor ones, with the branching ratio of the OH elimination channel growing with temperature and the rate constants for the individual bimolecular channels being independent of pressure. The calculated rate constants and product branching for cyclopenta[a]naphthalenyl + O2 closely agree with those reported earlier for the indenyl + O2 reaction and are recommended for the combustion kinetic models for the oxidation reactions of five-membered rings on free edges of larger polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules. The results also confirm that the oxidation of a π radical located on a five-membered ring with molecular oxygen is very slow.","Ghildina, A R; Zavershinskiy, I P; Mebel, A M; Vinogradov, K Yu; Bulanova, A V; Zhu, Hong",The journal of physical chemistry.

METHODS A cross-sectional survey was carried out in 2014 among individuals who had experienced the 1998 floods and had been diagnosed with PTSD in 1999 in Hunan, China. Cluster sampling was used to select subjects from the areas that had been surveyed in 1999. PTSD was diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria, social support was measured according to a Social Support Rating Scale, coping style was measured according to a Simplified Coping Style Questionnaire, and personality was measured by use of the revised Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Short Scale for Chinese. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews by use of a structured questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to reveal the determinants of chronic PTSD. RESULTS A total of 123 subjects were interviewed, 17 of whom (14.4%) were diagnosed with chronic PTSD. Chronic PTSD was significantly associated with disaster stressors (odds ratio [OR]: 1.74; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.22-2.47), nervousness (OR: 1.09; 95% CI: 1.01-1.17), and social support (OR: 0.85; 95 CI%: 0.74-0.98). CONCLUSIONS Chronic PTSD in flood victims is significantly associated with disaster stressors, nervousness, and social support. These factors may play important roles in identifying persons at high risk of chronic PTSD.","Chen, Long; Tan, Hongzhuan; Cofie, Reuben; Hu, Shimin; Li, Yan; Zhou, Jia; Yang, Tubao; Tang, Xuemin; Cui, Guanghui; Liu, Aizhong",Disaster medicine and public health preparedness,190,30

METHODS Mixed methods were used to evaluate the project, including a visitor (n = 1181) and artist (n = 85) log book, a convenience audience survey (n = 231), and qualitative semi-structured interviews (n = 13) with artists and audience to explore the effect of arts-based activities on access to sexual health information and services, and stigma and discrimination. RESULTS In total, 85 artists curated five separate exhibitions that were attended by 1181 people, of which 62% were aged ≤24 years. Gallery attendance improved awareness and participatory and interactive engagement with sexual health information through a medium described as interesting, fun, cool, and unique. The co-located clinic facilitated informal pathways to sexual health services, including HIV/AIDS testing, treatment, and care. Importantly, the project created shared understandings and empathy that challenged stereotypes and myths, reducing stigmatising beliefs and practices. CONCLUSIONS Arts-based programs are transformative and can be effectively implemented, replicated and scaled up in low-resource settings to create awareness and initiate for HIV prevention, testing, treatment, and care. Art-based health programs engages people in their communities, mobilises civil society, builds enabling environments to reduce stigma and discrimination and improves access to testing and prevention; essential features needed to end AIDS in Indonesia (and the Southeast Asia region) while improving the lives of those most vulnerable to infection.","Newland, Jamee; Lestari, Dwi; Poedjanadi, Mashoeroel Noor; Kelly-Hanku, Angela",Sexual health,190,24

The low percentage of children with asymptomatic cases compared with mild illness and moderate illness couldbe correlated with the rare cases of MIS-C. One potential explanation for the progression to severe MIS-C disease despite the presence of readily detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies could be due to the potential role of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE).

Findings demonstrated that service users and service providers often supported an abstinence choice and were ambivalent about the viability of controlled or managed use in both abstinence- and harm reduction-based programs. Findings showed that women service users in this study had significant rates of trauma and depression which were associated with their alcohol use; the majority still adopted dominant alcohol addiction discourse which emphasizes the need for abstinence.

Objective The aim of this study is to determine the out-of-pocket health expenditure for the management of diarrhoeal illness among the under-five children in in-patient and out-patient cases. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted during January-April 2018 among 60 under-five children with diarrheal illness reporting to pediatric outpatient department (OPD) and 60 under-five children admitted to pediatric ward of a tertiary care teaching hospital. For determining the out-of-pocket health expenditure, both direct and indirect costs for the management of diarrheal illness were estimated both for out-patient and in-patient cases. The cost of the treatment has been presented as the cost of prehospital visits, during a hospital visit and posthospital visit. Results Overall, median out-of-pocket health expenditure for the management of diarrheal illness for out-patient and in-patient cases were Rs. 1186 (interquartile range [IQR]: Rs. 510) and Rs. 6385 (IQR: Rs. 5889), respectively. The median direct expenditure for OPD cases was Rs. 778.50 (IQR: Rs. 263) and indirect expenditure for OPD cases were Rs. 407.50 (IQR: Rs. 336) The median direct and indirect expenditure for inpatient cases were Rs. 3823 (IQR: Rs. 1942) and Rs. 2237 (IQR: Rs. 4256) respectively. Only 13% of in-patient cases had some kind of medical insurance. Conclusion A considerable economic burden is faced by the families for treating diarrhea in under-five children. Improved access to safe drinking water and sanitation, promotion of hand hygiene, exclusive breastfeeding, rotavirus vaccination, and use of oral rehydration therapy will reduce hospitalization and out-of-pocket expenditure. The study findings recommend for appropriate policy for provision of financial protection while seeking health care services.","Pradhan, Himanshu Sekhar; Mohakud, Nirmal Kumar; Kavitha, A K; Nayak, Manas Kumar; Satpathy, Sudhir Kumar",Indian journal of public health,190,31

Some of this work, particularly the killing of animals, can impose significant psychological burdens that can diminish the well-being of laboratory animal personnel, as well as their capacity to care for animals. We propose that AECs, which regulate animal research in part on the basis of reducing harm, can and ought to require that these harms to researchers are reduced as well. The paper starts by presenting evidence of these burdens and their harm, giving some examples showing how they may be mitigated. We then argue that AECs are well placed to account for these harms to personnel and ought to use their power to reduce their occurrence. We conclude by responding to four potential objections: (1) that this problem should be addressed through health and safety administration, not research ethics administration; (2) that the proposal is unjustifiably paternalistic; (3) that these harms to laboratory animal personnel ought to occur, given their treatment of animals; and (4) that mitigating them may lead to worse treatment of research animals.","King, Mike; Zohny, Hazem",Journal of medical ethics,190,31

While fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has proved to be a highly effective treatment for recurrent CDI, its efficacy in severe or fulminant CDI remains uncertain. AIMS To perform a systematic review with meta-analysis evaluating clinical outcomes and safety of FMT in severe and fulminant CDI. METHODS A systemic review with meta-analysis was performed through comprehensive search of Embase, Medline (Ovid), trial registers, and conference abstracts through January 2020. Studies on FMT in severe and fulminant CDI were included. Meta-analysis was done with random effects models given heterogeneity to estimate rates of cure, mortality, and colectomy. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's test. RESULTS Sixteen studies comprised of one randomized controlled trial, four cohort studies, and eleven case series were analyzed. In total, 676 patients underwent FMT for severe or fulminant CDI. The overall rate of clinical cure after single FMT was 61.3% (95% CI 43.2-78.0%) with 10.9% (95% CI 0.2-30.2%) of patients experiencing major adverse events. The overall pooled colectomy rate after FMT was 8.2% (95% CI 0.1-23.7%) with a pooled all-cause mortality rate after FMT of 15.6% (95% CI 7.8-25.0%).

Because these families share some pathogens, peccaries can act as reservoirs of infectious pathogens for domestic and wild swine. We evaluated the presence of swine infectious agents in the spleen and lung tissues of white-lipped peccaries (WLP; Tayassu pecari) and collared peccaries (CP; Pecari tajacu) in Brazil. Samples from 10 adult CP and three WLP, which had been hunted by locals or hit by motor vehicles, were obtained from two free-ranging Brazilian populations. The samples were tested by PCR for Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Pasteurella multocida, porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), Suid herpesvirus 1 (SuHV-1), and porcine parvovirus (PPV). Positive samples were sequenced. Both species were negative for PPV and B. bronchiseptica and positive for PCV2 and SuHV-1. The lungs of two animals were positive for M. hyopneumoniae and P. multocida. This report is the first demonstration of PCV2 and SuHV-1 swine viruses and of M. hyopneumoniae and P. multocida bacteria in peccaries. One factor contributing to this detection was access to tissue samples, which is uncommon. The role of these infectious agents in peccaries is unknown and further epidemiologic studies should be performed. This study identified several infectious agents in peccaries and highlighted the importance of the tissue type used to detect pathogens.","de Castro, Alessandra Marnie Martins Gomes; Brombila, Talita; Bersano, Josete Garcia; Soares, Herbert Sousa; Silva, Sheila Oliveira de Souza; Minervino, Antonio Humberto Hamad; Ogata, Renato Akio; Gennari, Solange Maria; Richtzenhain, Leonardo Jose",Journal of wildlife diseases,190,16

In this study we investigated the pro-inflammatory activation of monocytes isolated from depressed patients as a parameter not influenced by such confounds as the time of day, the nutritional and exercise status or the age and gender of patients. Monocytes from depressed patients and from healthy controls were isolated in vitro; after 24-h incubation under basal conditions, cells were exposed for 24-h to 100 ng/ml of endotoxin (bacterial lipopolysaccharide, LPS). We found that monocytes from drug-free depressed patients and controls release the same amounts of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) under basal conditions, whereas monocytes from patients are dramatically less reactive to LPS (8.62-fold increase vs previous 24 hrs) compared to healthy controls (123.3-fold increase vs previous 24 hrs). Such blunted prostanoid production was paralleled by a reduction in COX-2 gene expression, whereas other pro-inflammatory mediators, namely interleukin-1β (IL-1 β) and -6 (IL-6) showed a trend to increased gene expression. The above changes were not associated to increased levels of circulating glucocorticoids. After 8 months of antidepressive drug treatment, the increase in PGE2 production after the endotoxin challenge was partially restored, whereas the increase in IL-1 β and -6 levels observed at baseline was completely abolished. In conclusion, our findings show that the reactivity of monocytes from depressed patients might be considered as a marker of the immune-inflammatory disorders associated to depression, although the lack of paired healthy controls at follow-up does not allow to conclude that monocyte reactivity to endotoxin is also a marker of treatment outcome.","Lisi, Lucia; Camardese, Giovanni; Treglia, Mariangela; Tringali, Giuseppe; Carrozza, Cinzia; Janiri, Luigi; Dello Russo, Cinzia; Navarra, Pierluigi",PloS one,190,6

In particular, US guidelines for adherence-related recommendations in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are not based on available SRs of adherence-outcome relationships; it is unclear why. No published studies report on the quality of SRs on HIV adherence and outcomes, which may be driving the lack of use. We describe the quality of this body of literature. METHODS Literature searches were conducted in Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PubMed Central, the Cochrane Library, Science Citation Index, Web of Science, ScIELO Citation Index, and Ovid Emcare. Screening and quality assessments were performed in duplicate using AMSTAR 2. Funding sources and impact factors of publishing journals were also extracted, and correlations between quality rankings and numbers of critical weaknesses versus impact factors were assessed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. RESULTS Nine SRs of 1141 records met eligibility criteria. Overall confidence in the results was critically low for most (78%) SRs. Underperformance was found across all AMSTAR 2 domains. Impact factor (a surrogate or journal reputation) did not correlate with quality. CONCLUSIONS SRs do not necessarily comprise top-level evidence despite the availability of quality appraisal tools and reporting guidance, which could explain the lack of SR evidence in US HIV medication adherence-related guideline recommendations.

Firstly, these tools can be used in functional genomics to elucidate gene function, and identify causal variants underlying monogenic traits. Secondly, they can be used to precisely introduce useful genetic variation into structured livestock breeding programs. Such variation may include repair of genetic defects, the inactivation of undesired genes, and the moving of useful alleles and haplotypes between breeds in the absence of linkage drag. Editing could also be used to accelerate the rate of genetic progress by enabling the replacement of the germ cell lineage of commercial breeding animals with cells derived from genetically elite lines. In the future, editing may also provide a useful complement to evolving approaches to decrease the length of the generation interval through in vitro generation of gametes. For editing to be adopted, it will need to seamlessly integrate with livestock breeding schemes. This will likely involve introducing edits into multiple elite animals to avoid genetic bottlenecks. It will also require editing of different breeds and lines to maintain genetic diversity, and enable structured cross-breeding. This requirement is at odds with the process-based trigger and event-based regulatory approach that has been proposed for the products of genome editing by several countries. In the absence of regulatory harmony, researchers in some countries will have the ability to use genome editing in food animals, while others will not, resulting in disparate access to these tools, and ultimately the potential for global trade disruptions.","Bishop, Thomas Frederick; Van Eenennaam, Alison Louise",The Journal of experimental biology,190,24

We reviewed and documented the information obtained from literature on epidemiology, pathogenesis and clinical appearances of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS The global cases of COVID-19 as of April 2, 2020, have risen to more than 900,000 and morbidity has reached more than 47,000. The incidence rate for COVID-19 has been predicted to be higher than the previous outbreaks of other coronavirus family members, including those of SARS-CoV and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). The main clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2 infection ranges from asymptomatic stages to severe lower respiratory infection in the form of pneumonia. Most of the patients also presented with fever, cough, sore throat, headache, fatigue, myalgia and breathlessness. Individuals at higher risk for severe illness include elderly people and patients with a weakened immune system or that are suffering from an underlying chronic medical condition like hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cancer, respiratory illness or cardiovascular diseases. CONCLUSIONS SARS-Cov-2 has emerged as a worldwide threat, currently affecting 170 countries and territories across the globe. There is still much to be understood regarding SARS-CoV-2 about its virology, epidemiology and clinical management strategies; this knowledge will be essential to both manage the current pandemic and to conceive comprehensive measures to prevent such outbreaks in the future.","Deshmukh, V; Tripathi, S C; Pandey, A; Deshmukh, V; Vykoukal, J; Patil, A; Sontakke, B",European review for medical and pharmacological sciences,190,28

However, patient satisfaction is always a concern regarding the use of telemedicine. Introduction: The aim of this study is to evaluate the perception and satisfaction level of patients toward the use of telemedicine during the pandemic of COVID-19 among Pakistani population. Materials and Methods: The survey questionnaires were distributed to 251 patients who received telemedicine consultation in any of three specializations: orthopedic, ophthalmology, and general medicine. The questionnaire contains 15 questions that covered four categories of patient satisfaction: interpersonal communication, caring, care delivery, and proficiency. Descriptive and analytical statistics were obtained by analyzing data using SPSS software version 20. Results: A total of 251 patients responded to the telemedicine questionnaire. Overall, 61.35% patients reported that they did not need any support for using technology during consultation and 96.41% of the patient population reported that telemedicine saved their travel time. It was found that gender, education, and age were significantly associated with the ease in technology with the p-value 0.012, 0.004 and <0.001, respectively, whereas the use of telemedicine again in future is found to be significantly associated with only education and age p-value <0.001.

In response to various extracellular signals, such as microbial or viral infection, changes to mitochondrial metabolism and physiology could underlie the corresponding state of macrophage activation. These changes include alterations of oxidative metabolism, mitochondrial membrane potential, and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycling, as well as the release of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and transformation of the mitochondrial ultrastructure. Here, we provide an updated review of how changes in mitochondrial metabolism and various metabolites such as fumarate, succinate, and itaconate coordinate to guide macrophage activation to distinct cellular states, thus clarifying the vital link between mitochondria metabolism and immunity. We also discuss how in disease settings, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress contribute to dysregulation of the inflammatory response. Therefore, mitochondria are a vital source of dynamic signals that regulate macrophage biology to fine-tune immune responses.","Wang, Yafang; Li, Na; Zhang, Xin; Horng, Tiffany",The Journal of biological chemistry,190,14

Although respiratory viral testing is often performed, it is unclear how positive results impact antibiotic use. We sought to assess the impact of respiratory viral testing on antibiotic use in hospitalized children on CPPV. METHODS This retrospective cohort study included hospitalized children on CPPV who had respiratory viral polymerase chain reaction (RVP) testing on admission. Primary exposure was a positive RVP result; primary outcome was antibiotic de-escalation, defined as discontinuation of antibiotics or narrowing of antimicrobial spectra. To determine the independent association of positive RVP and antibiotic de-escalation, a generalized linear mixed effect model was used to account for within patient clustering and confounders defined a priori (blood and respiratory cultures, leukocytosis, bandemia, chest radiograph findings, aspiration risk, and recent admission). RESULTS A total of 200 admissions representing 118 patients were included. A viral pathogen was identified in 46.5% (93/200) of admissions; rhinovirus was most frequently identified (61.5% of positive RVPs). Antibiotic de-escalation occurred in 33% of admissions (35.5% of RVP-positive admissions vs. 30.8% of RVP-negative admissions, p=0.49). In adjusted analysis, there was no association between positive RVP and antibiotics de-escalation (adjusted OR: 0.86, 95% confidence interval: 0.32-2.26). CONCLUSION This single center cohort study suggests that respiratory viral testing may not impact antibiotic prescribing for hospitalized children on CPPV. There is need for improved stewardship of both diagnostic testing and antimicrobial use in this population. This article is protected by copyright.

We used data from US government health surveys to report the prevalence, trends, and impact of this condition by age, sex, and poverty status. METHODS We identified the most recent, publicly available summary statistics from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, and the National Health Interview Survey. We extracted and compiled relevant information from each study, with an emphasis on sex, age, and economic-related statistics. RESULTS The age-adjusted prevalence of migraine and severe headache in the United States has remained stable over many years. In 2018, the age-adjusted prevalence was 15.9% across all adults. The sex ratio also remains stable, with 21% of women and 10.7% of men affected. Migraine continues to be an important public health problem, accounting for roughly 4 million emergency department (ED) visits in 2016, when headache was the fifth most common reason for an ED visit overall and the third most common reason for ED visits in females 15-64. Migraine also accounted for over 4.3 million office visits. Many adults with migraine or severe headaches are disadvantaged. In 2018, for example, roughly 40% of US adults with migraine were unemployed, and a similar proportion were classified as poor or ""near poor."" Roughly one in five had no health insurance and about a third had a high school education or less. CONCLUSIONS Migraine and severe headaches are a serious public health issue in the United States, with the highest impact in women of childbearing age and those of lower socioeconomic status. Socioeconomic disadvantages also are highly prevalent among those with headaches. The economic consequences of the current coronavirus pandemic are likely to exacerbate all of these inequities. Increased attention to this high impact chronic pain condition, and improved funding for treatment provision and research, are warranted to reduce the future burden of disease.","Burch, Rebecca; Rizzoli, Paul; Loder, Elizabeth",Headache,190,1

The GALI is widely used in the European Union; however, evidence of its construct validity is still limited. We examine whether the GALI reflects disability in specific living contexts such as self-care, domestic life and work activity, whether it does so consistently across gender and age and its added value concerning SRH. METHODS We used the subsample of adults aged 16-64 years (N = 15 934) from the 2009 European Health Interview Survey in Spain and analyzed the data with logistic regression models using the GALI and SRH as response variables. RESULTS The GALI was strongly and significantly associated with the three measures of disability: self-care (OR = 22.8, 95% CI: 15.9-32.7), domestic life (OR = 16.3, 95% CI: 13.6-19.5) and work activity (e.g. impossibility to work: OR = 41.9, 95% CI: 30.3-57.8; prolonged sick leave: OR = 10.7, 95% CI: 9-12.7). There were significant interactions with age on all three disability measures and with the gender on one (domestic life), although they were small. SRH was also strongly associated with all three disability measures, but to a lesser extent than the GALI. CONCLUSIONS The GALI reflects well and better than SRH, disability in self-care, domestic life and work activity. It is unknown whether the GALI performs equally in other living contexts such as social relations and community life.","Cabrero-García, Julio; Juliá-Sanchis, Rocío; Richart-Martínez, Miguel",European journal of public health,190,1

The basic principles of such measures to reduce the risk of exposure and limit the doses of irradiation follow the ""as low as reasonably achievable "" or ALARA principle by using the concepts of time, distance and shielding. Potential exposures in radiation oncology are controlled through combination of optimal design and installation of radiation delivery equipment with well-defined standard operating procedures (SOPs). In the modern era of viral pandemics, similar principles can also be applied toward prevention of viral transmission and protection of populations at risk. In the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the probability of an individual getting infected is dependent on the viral load that an individual is exposed to in public spaces over a period of time. All prevention and control measures are based on preventing any such exposure to the virus, that can be achieved through limiting space for movement of the virus, using barriers and increasing distance to vulnerable surfaces, and limiting the duration of exposure. Apart from adhering to the laid-down provisions of a lock-down, preventive measures recommended for the general public include maintaining hand-hygiene, social distancing, and using facemasks to break the chain of transmission. Appropriate triage and customization of treatment protocols can help curtail hospital visits and time-spent by cancer patients during pandemic times, thereby reducing their risk of exposure as well as allowing efficient utilization of resources. The outbreak of the contagious COVID-19 pandemic threatens to disrupt healthcare systems globally with its unprecedented challenges. However, despite all the difficulties and hardships, it has also enabled new ways of learning and communication, which are likely to persist even in the post-COVID world.","Mukherji, Ashutosh; Gupta, Tejpal; Agarwal, Jai Prakash",Indian journal of cancer,190,1

This has intensified during the Covid-19 pandemic, which disproportionately affected care home communities with various human rights ramifications. Activist scholarship in human rights can contribute to the protection and realisation of the rights of people living, working in and visiting care homes through high-quality research. This article reports the findings of an analysis of pre-pandemic scholarship that explored the ways authors approached the topic of human rights of older people in care homes. The aim was to produce a typology of approaches to the topic as a basis for critical reflection and as a starting point for future activist scholarship in gerontology, social policy and law. Reflexive thematic analysis of 23 international English-language peer-reviewed articles published between 1998 and March 2019 was undertaken. Analysis was framed in the context of the health and social care setting of England. The article reports the pertinent and common assumptions that care homes are ‘inherently risky’ places for the protection of the human rights of ‘vulnerable’ care home residents. The article highlights five types of approaches: the anti-institutional, the legalistic, the care quality, the equality approach, and the issue-based approach.

This is presumed due to low immunity associated with other comorbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, obesity and metabolic syndrome. But the information available on the immune status of COVID-19 patients is limited. Attempts must be made to enhance our understanding of the immune status of COVID-19 patients by revisiting our knowledge on the immune mechanisms of already known coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Early elevation of the serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines observed in SARS and MERS infection suggests a possible same type of cytokine storm-mediated lung damage in COVID-19 patients too. Dysregulation of interferon-1 response and downstream cascade in initial innate immune response at virus entry point has been related to lethal pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Adaptive response of increased CD8+ levels in COVID-19 patients seems to be useful in mild cases where it causes deteriorating effects in progressed severe disease patients resulting in destruction of type 2 pneumocytes hence inability to regenerate the alveolar epithelium. A phenomenon called cytokine storm activates violent immunological reactions in the lung tissue resulting in ARDS followed by multiple organ system damages in COVID-19 patients. Several immune evading mechanisms are thought to be employed by severe respiratory syndrome virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) that might have resulted in its extremely increased contagiousness probably related with its frequent RNA mutations. Failure to develop adequate virus limiting immune reactions by some cured patients warrant monitoring of all recovered patients. This rapid mini review is aimed to enhance our knowledge of the immune status of COVID-19 infected patients with reference to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.","Karikalan, Barani; Darnal, Hari Kumar",J.

Through our experience and data from managing COVID-19 exposures and outbreaks in LTCFs in the Fraser Health region in British Columbia, Canada, we identified risk factors associated with outbreak severity to inform current outbreak management strategies and future pandemic preparedness planning efforts. Methods: We used a retrospective cohort study design to evaluate the association between non-modifiable factors (facility building, organization level, and resident population characteristics), modifiable factors (assessments for infection prevention and control (IPC) and public health measures), and severity of COVID-19 outbreaks (attack rate) in LTCFs. We modelled the COVID-19 attack rates in LTCF outbreaks using negative binomial regression models. Results: From March 1, 2020 to January 10, 2021, a total of 145 exposures to at least one confirmed case of COVID-19 in 82 LTCFs occurred. For every item not met in the assessment tool, a 22% increase in the attack rate was observed (rate ratio 1.2 [95% CI 1.1 to 1.4]) after adjusting for other risk factors such as age of the facility, index case type (resident vs. staff) and proportion of single bed rooms. Conclusion: Our findings highlight the importance of assessing IPC and public health measures for outbreak management. They also demonstrate the important modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors associated with COVID-19 outbreaks in our jurisdiction.

Objective: To evaluate immune persistence of two priming doses of CoronaVac, and immunogenicity and safety of a third dose in healthy adults [≥]60 years. Design, setting, and participants: We conducted a vaccine booster study built on a single-center, randomized, double-blind phase 1/2 trial of the two-dose schedule of CoronaVac among healthy adults[≥]60 years in Hebei, China. We examined neutralizing antibody titres six months or more after the second dose in all participants. We provided a third dose to 303 participants recruited in phase 2 trial to assess their immune responses. Interventions: Two formulations (3 g, and 6 g) were used in phase 1 trial, and an additional formulation of 1.5 g was used in phase 2 trial. All participants were given two doses 28 days apart and followed up 6 months after the second dose. Participants in phase 2 received a third dose 8 months after the second dose. Main outcomes and measures: Geometric mean titres (GMT) of neutralizing antibodies to live SARS-CoV-2 and adverse events were assessed at multiple time points following vaccination. Results: Neutralizing antibody titres dropped below the seropositive cutoff of 8 at 6 months after the primary vaccination in all vaccine groups in the phase 1/2 trial. A third dose given 8 months or more after the second dose significantly increased neutralizing antibody levels. In the 3 g group (the licensed formulation), GMT increased to 305 [95%CI 215.3-432.0] on day 7 following the third dose, an approximately 7-fold increase compared with the GMT 28 days after the second dose. All solicited adverse reactions reported within 28 days after a booster dose were of grade 1 or 2 severity. Conclusion and relevance: Neutralizing antibody titres declined substantially six months after two doses of CoronaVac among older adults. A booster dose rapidly induces robust immune responses.

Objective: To determine PCV13 effectiveness against all-cause inpatient plus outpatient medically-attended lower-respiratory tract infection (LRTI) and pneumonia among US older adults. Design: Prospective, open cohort study following participants from 2016 to 2019. We conducted analyses in a self-matched framework, comparing outcomes during participants' follow-up periods before and after receipt of PCV13. Setting: Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) integrated healthcare delivery system. Participants: Adults aged [≥]65 years who received PCV13 between 2016-2019. Exposures: Receipt of PCV13 at ages [≥]65 years, concordant with ACIP guidelines. Main outcomes and measures: We estimated the adjusted hazards ratio (aHR) for first LRTI and pneumonia episodes during each respiratory season, comparing PCV13-exposed and PCV13-unexposed time at risk for each participant using a self-matched inference framework. We computed aHR estimates using Cox proportional hazards models. We defined vaccine effectiveness (VE) as (1-aHR)*100%. We also estimated PCV13-attributable absolute reductions in incidence of LRTI and pneumonia. Results: Observations were available both before and after PCV13 receipt for 42,700 participants. Among these individuals, 1,419 experienced LRTI and 969 experienced pneumonia over approximately 26,000 combined years of follow-up before PCV13 receipt; 3,849 experienced LRTI and 2,727 experienced pneumonia over approximately 74,000 combined years of follow-up after PCV13 receipt. In adjusted analyses, VE was 9.5% (95% confidence interval: 2.2% to 16.3%) against all-cause medically-attended LRTI and 8.8% (-0.2% to 17.0%) against all-cause medically-attended pneumonia. In contrast, we did not identify evidence of protection against LRTI and pneumonia following receipt of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. We estimated that PCV13 prevented 0.7 (0.2 to 1.4) and 0.5 (0.0 to 1.0) cases of LRTI and pneumonia, respectively, per 100 vaccinated persons annually. Over a five-year time horizon, one case of LRTI and pneumonia, respectively, was prevented for every 27 (14 to 116) and 42 (-97 to 268) individuals receiving PCV13.

Materials and methods: We conducted a case series of 50 patients with hypoxic COVID-19 treated with intravenous MB admitted to our hospital between June 01 and September 10, 2020. Intravenous MB was administered as rescue therapy in dosage of 1 mg/kg body weight, with a maximum of five doses, to patients with high oxygen requirements (SpO2/FiO2 <200) apart from the standard of care after obtaining G6PD levels. Data were abstracted from multiple electronic data sources or patient charts to provide information on patient characteristics, clinical and laboratory variables and outcomes. Results: The median age of the patients was 53.3 (range 25–74 years) and most patients (74%) were men. About 68% of patients had pre-existing comorbidity. Median SpO2/FiO2 ratio progressively improved from 132.5 (predose) to 284 before the terminal event (death or discharge), ventilator-free days, and decrease in the proinflammatory biochemical parameter was significantly higher after the second dose of MB. A total of six patients out of 50 required invasive mechanical ventilation. Thirty patients were discharged with a recovery rate of 60%, while 20 patients succumbed to the illness.

Design: Explorative qualitative interview study. Participants: Twenty one scientists with an official government advisory role during the COVID-19 pandemic in Belgium, the Netherlands, UK, Sweden or Germany. Methods: Online video or telephone semi-structured interviews took place between December 2020 and April 2021. They were audio recorded and transcribed, and analyzed using a combination of inductive and deductive thematic analysis techniques. Results: Scientists found working on the advisory boards during the COVID-19 pandemic to be a rewarding experience. However, they identified numerous challenges including learning to work in an interdisciplinary way, ensuring that evidence is understood and taken on board by governments, and dealing with media and public reactions. Scientists found themselves taking on new roles, the boundaries of which were not clearly defined. Consequently, they received substantial media attention and were often perceived and treated as a public figure. Conclusions: Scientists working on advisory boards in European countries faced similar challenges, highlighting key lessons to be learnt. Future pandemic preparedness efforts should focus on building interdisciplinary collaboration within advisory boards; ensuring transparency in how boards operate; defining and protecting boundaries of the scientific advisor role; and supporting scientists to inform the public in the fight against disinformation, whilst dealing with potential hostile reactions.","Colman, E.; Wanat, M.; Goosens, H.; Tonkin-Crine, S.; Anthierens, S.",,190,5

Life coaching can improve QOL in a structured & personalized manner. We investigated the feasibility of a digital life coaching (DLC) platform, where coaching is accomplished through phone calls and text messages, for patients with MM during ASCT. Methods: Our pilot study (clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT04432818) enrolled adult patients with MM, English proficiency, and cellphone ownership (smartphone not required). The 16-week DLC program, beginning at Day -5 before ASCT, included unlimited digital access to a certified life coach to help with identifying and accomplishing wellness-related goals. Our primary outcome was ongoing DLC engagement (≥ 1 bidirectional conversation every 4 weeks). Secondary outcomes were ePRO assessments of QOL (PROMIS Global Health), insomnia (PROMIS Sleep Disturbances), and distress (NCCN DT). Electronic patient-reported outcome (ePRO) assessments were delivered via automated REDCap emails every 1-2 weeks. Results: Of 18 screened patients, 15 (83%) enrolled in our study;2 patients dropped out before initiating DLC (including 1 who was unable to connect with her coach between Day -5 and 0). Of 13 remaining patients, median age was 65 (range 50-81) and 23% had an ECOG performance status of 1 (remainder 0). DLC conversations occurred a mean of every 7.6 days (range 3-28) overall and every 6.5 days (range 2.8-14) during the initial 28- day period including high-dose melphalan and hospitalization. 80% of patients maintained ≥ 1 conversation every 4 weeks. Selected ePRO results (mean ± standard error) are shown in the table. Conclusions: Certain MM patients are able to engage digitally with a life coach and complete email-based ePRO assessments during and after ASCT. Limitations of our study include selection bias and the Day -5 start date, which may be too late logistically and symptom-wise (given our ePRO findings suggestive of peak distress pre- ASCT). DLC may play an innovative and scalable role given the emphasis on remotely delivered care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for consideration of alternative anaesthetic techniques to a general anaesthetic (GA). This audit looks at the anaesthetic practice for i&d of abscess on the emergency list pre and post COVID-19, to help determine if there is an impact on post operative nausea and vomiting (PONV), pain, and duration of hospital stay.MethodsPatients undergoing an i&d of lower body abscess were identified between 1/1/20 – 29/2/20 (pre COVID-19) and 1/3/20 – 9/5/20 (post COVID-19). The patients’ electronic records were reviewed and the following data collected: age, ASA, gender, weight, BMI, co-morbidities, inflammatory markers, NEWS score, anaesthetic administered, post op anti-emetics and analgesics, problems encountered and duration of stay.ResultsThere were 49 cases from 1/1/20 – 29/2/20 (pre COVID-19) and 36 from 1/3/20 – 9/5/20 (post COVID-19). Of the pre COVID-19 cases 42/49 (85.7%) cases were done under GA and 1/49 (2%) under spinal. Of the post COVID-19 cases 50% were done under spinal and 50% were done under GA. Of the patients receiving a GA, 1/60 (2%) required an antiemetic in recovery and 30/60 (50%) required analgesia in recovery. Of the patients receiving a spinal, 2/19 (11%) required an antiemetic in recovery and 3/19 (16%) required analgesia in recovery. Of the patients receiving a spinal 13/19 (68%) were discharged on the same day of surgery compared to 42/60 (70%) patients receiving GA.ConclusionThe results of this audit (although small) provide evidence that having a spinal does not lengthen a patient’s stay in hospital and may offer superior pain relief post-operatively. Although more patients were receiving spinals post COVID-19, there were still 50% of cases done under GA, which is possibly due to hesitancy of inserting spinal in the presence of systemic infection.","Anna-Marie, Tiah",BMJ Leader,190,1

The two proteins comigrated in a complex of 45 to 55 kDa when the virion proteins were electrophoresed under nonreducing conditions but dissociated under reducing conditions. Furthermore, VP-2/M was quantitatively precipitated along with VP-3 in this complex by three neutralizing monoclonal antibodies to VP-3. The infectivity of LDV was rapidly and irreversibly lost during incubation with 5 to 10 mM dithiothreitol (> 99% in 6 h at room temperature), which is known to reduce disulfide bonds. LDV inactivation correlated with dissociation of VP-2/M and VP-3. The results suggest that disulfide bonds between VP-2/M and VP-3 are important for LDV infectivity. Hydrophobic moment analyses of the predicted proteins suggest that VP-2/M and VP-3 both possess three adjacent transmembrane segments and only very short ectodomains (10 and 32 amino acids, respectively) with one and two cysteines, respectively. Inactivation of LDV by dithiothreitol and dissociation of the two envelope proteins were not associated with alterations in LDV's density or sedimentation coefficient.","Faaberg, K S; Even, C; Palmer, G A; Plagemann, P G",Journal of virology,190,5

So far, although some studies suggested some medications may be helpful, there is no effective treatment for COVID-19. It is critical to find important risk factors that affects the recovery or severity of COVID-19 and guide the treatment for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. In this study, we recruited these discharged patients with COVID-19 from hospitals. We collected clinical data and analyzed the time from disease onset to the positive-to-negative transmission (TPNT) of nucleic acid tests and its related clinical variables. TPNT was considered as an important indicator for the recovery of COVID-19 patients from SARS-CoV-2 infection. COVID-19 patients were divided into short TPNT group and long TPNT group. There were significant differences on hypertension, abidol treatment, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), lymphocyte counts, and serum triglyceride (TG) between two groups (P<0.05). Patients in low TPNT group had higher serum triglyceride and less proportion of hypertension. Further logistic regression analysis showed that TPNT was highly associated with serum TG level and hypertension that were related to the expression of ACE2, the targeting protein for the invasion of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, our findings demonstrate that serum triglyceride level and hypertension were important influencing factors for the recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, diet changes and antihypertensive medications can be translational to the treatment of COVID-19 and promote the recovery of COVID-19 patients.","Wang, Liping; Zhang, Yifa; Cheng, Yanbo; Li, Chunyang; Wang, Yongxiang; Yan, Xuebing; Xu, Xingshun",American journal of translational research,190,22

Although direct evidence for this association is still lacking, numerous data from animal models as well as from humans support the hypothesis of a direct contribution of pathogens to the induction of several ARD. This review focuses on the possible role of infectious agents as triggers of autoimmunity in systemic lupus erythematosus, polymyositis-dermatomyositis, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and primary vasculitis. Indeed, vasculitis may be a clinical manifestation of an infectious disease (secondary vasculitis). In addition, immune response abnormalities and immunosuppressive medications may be responsible for the high percentage of infectious complications in ARD patients. Recent therapeutic approaches aimed at lowering doses of cytotoxic agents and shortening duration of treatment with the most toxic drugs, have proved to be as effective as conventional regimens. New drugs and strategies aimed at preventing infections could further improve the outcome of ARD patients.","Avcin, T; Canova, M; Guilpain, P; Guillevin, L; Kallenberg, C G M; Tincani, A; Tonon, M; Zampieri, S; Doria, A",Clinical and experimental rheumatology,190,16

Human coronaviruses 229E and OC43 possess not only three similar size classes of polypeptides but also three distinct antigens, none of which cross-react with the heterologous strain. Polypeptides separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were reacted in rocket immunoelectrophoresis with antiserum monospecific to each of the three strain-specific antigens (excised precipitin lines from crossed immunoelectrophoresis profiles were used for immunogens). Monospecific antiserum with neutralizing ability reacted with a polypeptide of 186,000 daltons for 229E and a polypeptide of 190,000 daltons for OC43. The antigen which elicited neutralizing antibody response was located at the surface, associated with the corona of the virion, glycosylated, and bound by concanavalin A. Another less prominent surface antigen was represented by size classes of 23,000 daltons for 229E and 24,000 for OC43. The core antigens of the viruses had molecular weights of 49,000 and 229E and 52,000 and OC43 virus. Thus, the molecular weights and functions of the antigens of human coronaviruses are similar to those of animal coronaviruses.

METHODS In this prospective study, nasopharyngeal aspirates were taken from children aged <18 years with symptoms of acute respiratory infection admitted to Queen Mary Hospital on one fixed day of the week during August 2001-July 2002 for detection of common respiratory viruses by immunofluorescence, viral culture, and for rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, and coronaviruses by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The clinical features of rhinovirus infections were analyzed and hospitalization disease burden was estimated. RESULTS Altogether 239 of the 426 nasopharyngeal aspirates (56.1%) were positive for respiratory viruses, including 151 patients with rhinovirus (35.4%). The median age was 2.34 years. Upper respiratory infection, asthma exacerbation, pneumonia, and acute bronchiolitis were diagnosed in 44.4%, 19.9%, 11.3%, and 7.9%, respectively. The most common symptoms were cough (81.5%), runny nose (76.8%), and fever (68.9%). Shortness of breath, wheezes, and crepitation were present in 25.8%, 29.1%, and 18.5%, respectively. Fifty-five of 99 patients (55.6%) had chest radiographic abnormalities, most commonly perihilar streakiness. Children with chronic diseases were more likely to have lower respiratory tract infection and these children required longer hospitalization (mean 0.6 days longer). Coinfection with other respiratory pathogens was common (33.1%). CONCLUSION Rhinovirus is frequently associated with asthmatic exacerbations and lower respiratory tract infection, especially in children with chronic diseases and is potentially an important contributor to hospitalization in children in Hong Kong.","Cheuk, Daniel K L; Tang, Ivan W H; Chan, Kwok Hung; Woo, Patrick C Y; Peiris, Malik J S; Chiu, Susan S",The Pediatric infectious disease journal,190,33

Inflammatory-driven processes are likely primary drivers of coagulopathy in COVID-19, but the exact mechanisms linking inflammation to dysregulated hemostasis and thrombosis are yet to be delineated. Cumulative findings of microvascular thrombosis has raised question if the endothelium and microvasculature should be a point of investigative focus. von Willebrand factor (VWF) and its protease, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13 (ADAMTS-13), play important role in the maintenance of microvascular hemostasis. In inflammatory conditions, imbalanced VWF-ADAMTS-13 characterized by elevated VWF levels and inhibited and/or reduced activity of ADAMTS-13 has been reported. Also, an imbalance between ADAMTS-13 activity and VWF antigen is associated with organ dysfunction and death in patients with systemic inflammation. A thorough understanding of VWF-ADAMTS-13 interactions during early and advanced phases of COVID-19 could help better define the pathophysiology, guide thromboprophylaxis and treatment, and improve clinical prognosis.","Katneni, Upendra K; Alexaki, Aikaterini; Hunt, Ryan C; Schiller, Tal; DiCuccio, Michael; Buehler, Paul W; Ibla, Juan C; Kimchi-Sarfaty, Chava",Thromb. haemost,190,20

They represent a key countermeasure to limit epidemics caused by emerging infectious diseases. The Ebola virus disease crisis in West Africa dramatically revealed the need for a rapid and strategic development of vaccines to effectively control outbreaks. Seven years later, in light of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, this need has never been as urgent as it is today. Vaccine development and implementation of clinical trials have been greatly accelerated, but still lack strategic design and evaluation. Responses to vaccination can vary widely across individuals based on factors like age, microbiome, co-morbidities and sex. The latter aspect has received more and more attention in recent years and a growing body of data provide evidence that sex-specific effects may lead to different outcomes of vaccine safety and efficacy. As these differences might have a significant impact on the resulting optimal vaccine regimen, sex-based differences should already be considered and investigated in pre-clinical and clinical trials. In this Review, we will highlight the clinical observations of sex-specific differences in response to vaccination, delineate sex differences in immune mechanisms, and will discuss the possible resulting implications for development of vaccine candidates against emerging infections. As multiple vaccine candidates against COVID-19 that target the same antigen are tested, vaccine development may undergo a decisive change, since we now have the opportunity to better understand mechanisms that influence vaccine-induced reactogenicity and effectiveness of different vaccines.","Fathi, Anahita; Addo, Marylyn M; Dahlke, Christine",Front Immunol,190,18

It is found that the poor housing mechanism, persistent inequalities, and poor housing environments have a significant impact on the health of vulnerable groups. Therefore, the government must make concerted efforts across all sectors to ensure that the housing and health care needs of vulnerable groups are improved, and that housing security standards and related policies are improved; targeted safety plans are formulated with community as the carrier, taking into account the characteristics of vulnerable groups; and new information technology is widely used to provide medical convenience for vulnerable groups. It is hoped that the research in this paper can arouse social attention to the health of vulnerable groups and improve their health from the perspective of housing, so as to point out the direction for solving the housing health problems of vulnerable groups in the future.","Chen, Junhua; Hao, Shuya; Wu, Ying",Rev. environ. health,190,12

That included 2595 deaths. The specific objective of this study was to estimate the fiscal value of human lives lost due to COVID-19 in China as of 24th February 2020. RESULTS: The deaths from COVID-19 had a discounted (at 3%) total fiscal value of Int$ 924,346,795 in China. Out of which, 63.2% was borne by people aged 25-49 years, 27.8% by people aged 50-64 years, and 9.0% by people aged 65 years and above. The average fiscal value per death was Int$ 356,203. Re-estimation of the economic model alternately with 5% and 10 discount rates led to a reduction in the expected total fiscal value by 21.3% and 50.4%, respectively. Furthermore, the re-estimation of the economic model using the world's highest average life expectancy of 87.1 years (which is that of Japanese females), instead of the national life expectancy of 76.4 years, increased the total fiscal value by Int$ 229,456,430 (24.8%).","Kirigia, Joses M; Muthuri, Rose Nabi Deborah Karimi",BMC Res Notes,190,33

Findings contribute to the scarce literature on online synchronous data collection for quantitative studies, when in addition to the data it is necessary to assess observable behaviors. Video-conferencing proved to be a feasible alternative to face-to-face assessment interviews, which require video recording, and should be considered as a viable option for quantitative investigations of different disciplines, as it decreases risks due to face-to-face contact and mobility of participants and researchers, in continental countries like Brazil.

Although several COVID-19 vaccines have become available, the prospective timeframe for achieving effective levels of vaccination across global populations remains uncertain. Moreover, the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants presents continuing potential challenges for future vaccination planning. Therefore, development of effective antiviral therapies continues to be an urgent unmet need for COVID-19. Successful antiviral regimens for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus infections have established viral proteases as validated targets for antiviral drug development. In this context, we review here protease targets in drug development, currently available antiviral protease inhibitors, and therapeutic development efforts on SARS-CoV-2 main protease and papain-like protease. Significance Statement Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to be a global threat since its emergence. The development of effective antiviral therapeutics for COVID-19 remains an urgent and long-term need.

Due to the rapid human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2, many healthcare systems are at risk of exceeding their healthcare capacities, in particular in terms of SARS-CoV-2 tests, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds and mechanical ventilators. Predictive algorithms could potentially ease the strain on healthcare systems by identifying those who are most likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, be hospitalised or admitted to the ICU. Here, we study clinical predictive models that estimate, using machine learning and based on routinely collected clinical data, which patients are likely to receive a positive SARS-CoV-2 test, require hospitalisation or intensive care. To evaluate the predictive performance of our models, we perform a retrospective evaluation on clinical and blood analysis data from a cohort of 5644 patients. Our experimental results indicate that our predictive models identify (i) patients that test positive for SARS-CoV-2 a priori at a sensitivity of 75% (95% CI: 67%, 81%) and a specificity of 49% (95% CI: 46%, 51%), (ii) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that require hospitalisation with 0.92 AUC (95% CI: 0.81, 0.98), and (iii) SARS-CoV-2 positive patients that require critical care with 0.98 AUC (95% CI: 0.95, 1.00).

While there is evidence that the burden of COVID-19 infection in hospitalized children is lesser than in their adult counterparts, to date, there are only limited reports describing COVID-19 in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs). Objective: To provide an early description and characterization of COVID-19 infection in North American PICUs, focusing on mode of presentation, presence of comorbidities, severity of disease, therapeutic interventions, clinical trajectory, and early outcomes. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study included children positive for COVID-19 admitted to 46 North American PICUs between March 14 and April 3, 2020. with follow-up to April 10, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Prehospital characteristics, clinical trajectory, and hospital outcomes of children admitted to PICUs with confirmed COVID-19 infection. Results: Of the 48 children with COVID-19 admitted to participating PICUs, 25 (52%) were male, and the median (range) age was 13 (4.2-16.6) years. Forty patients (83%) had significant preexisting comorbidities; 35 (73%) presented with respiratory symptoms and 18 (38%) required invasive ventilation. Eleven patients (23%) had failure of 2 or more organ systems. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was required for 1 patient (2%). Targeted therapies were used in 28 patients (61%), with hydroxychloroquine being the most commonly used agent either alone (11 patients) or in combination (10 patients). At the completion of the follow-up period, 2 patients (4%) had died and 15 (31%) were still hospitalized, with 3 still requiring ventilatory support and 1 receiving extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. The median (range) PICU and hospital lengths of stay for those who had been discharged were 5 (3-9) days and 7 (4-13) days, respectively. Conclusions and Relevance: This early report describes the burden of COVID-19 infection in North American PICUs and confirms that severe illness in children is significant but far less frequent than in adults. Prehospital comorbidities appear to be an important factor in children. These preliminary observations provide an important platform for larger and more extensive studies of children with COVID-19 infection.","Shekerdemian, Lara S; Mahmood, Nabihah R; Wolfe, Katie K; Riggs, Becky J; Ross, Catherine E; McKiernan, Christine A; Heidemann, Sabrina M; Kleinman, Lawrence C; Sen, Anita I; Hall, Mark W; Priestley, Margaret A; McGuire, John K; Boukas, Konstantinos; Sharron, Matthew P; Burns, Jeffrey P",JAMA Pediatr,190,22

The several weeks pandemic of the COVID-19 disease has forced the healthcare systems of numerous countries to adjust their resources to the care of the growing number of COVID-19 patients. Managers were presented with the challenge of protecting the healthcare workers from transmission of the disease within medical institutions, and issues concerning the physical and psychological depletion of personnel. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Based on analyses of the structure and work processes in Central Clinical Hospital (CCH) reconstructive strategic plan was developed. It included: division of existing wards into observation and isolation wards; installing locks; weekly plan for supplying personal protection equipment (PPE); designating new access to the hospital and communication routes; training of medical and supporting staff. The plan was implemented from the first days of conversion of the hospital. RESULTS: The wards of the CCH were converted for observation and isolation, and each one was fitted with sanitary locks. There was a big improvement in the supply of PPE for the medical staff. Separation of the 'dirty' and 'clean' parts of the CCH were attained, and widespread intensive training not only protected personnel against infections, but also diminished unrest which was discernable at the beginning of conversion. CONCLUSIONS: The transformation efforts will ultimately be appraised at the end of the epidemic, but the data looks encouraging. Two weeks after conversion, the testing of hospital Staff was started and by the end of April, 459 tests were had been conducted, of which only 11 were positive.","Król, Zbigniew; Szymanski, Piotr; Bochnia, Adrian; Abramowicz, Emilia; Plachta, Agnieszka; Rzeplinski, Radoslaw; Slugocki, Mikolaj; Nowak, Blazej; Zaczynski, Artur; Kozlowski, Krzysztof; Posobkiewicz, Marek; Wierzba, Waldemar",Ann Agric Environ Med,190,32

DESIGN: This is a retrospective, cross-sectional study in which clinical and laboratory data from 237 women of child-bearing age diagnosed with COVID-19 were retrospectively reviewed. Menstrual data from 177 patients were analysed. Blood samples from the early follicular phase were tested for sex hormones and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH). RESULTS: Among 237 patients with confirmed COVID-19, severely ill patients had more comorbidities than mildly ill patients (34% versus 8%), particularly for patients with diabetes, hepatic disease and malignant tumours. Of 177 patients with menstrual records, 45 (25%) patients presented with menstrual volume changes, and 50 (28%) patients had menstrual cycle changes, mainly a decreased volume (20%) and a prolonged cycle (19%). The average sex hormone and AMH concentrations of women of child-bearing age with COVID-19 were not different from those of age-matched controls. CONCLUSIONS: Average sex hormone concentrations and ovarian reserve did not change significantly in COVID-19 women of child-bearing age. Nearly one-fifth of patients exhibited a menstrual volume decrease or cycle prolongation. The menstruation changes of these patients might be the consequence of transient sex hormone changes caused by suppression of ovarian function that quickly resume after recovery.","Li, Kezhen; Chen, Ge; Hou, Hongyan; Liao, Qiuyue; Chen, Jing; Bai, Hualin; Lee, Shiyeow; Wang, Cheng; Li, Huijun; Cheng, Liming; Ai, Jihui",Reprod. biomed. online,190,16

The glycosyltransferase ST6Gal-I is known to block homeostatic apoptosis through &#945;2,6-linked sialylation of the death receptor TNFR1 in many cell types. However, its role has not been investigated in gastric epithelial cells or gastric tumorigenesis. We determined that human gastric antral epithelium rarely expressed ST6Gal-I, but the number of ST6Gal-I-expressing epithelial cells increased significantly with advancing premalignancy leading to cancer. The mRNA expression level of ST6GAL-I and SOX9 in human gastric epithelial cells correlated positively with one another through the premalignancy cascade, indicating that increased epithelial cell expression of ST6Gal-I is associated with premalignant progression. To determine the functional impact of increased ST6Gal-I, we generated human gastric antral organoids from epithelial stem cells and differentiated epithelial monolayers from gastric organoids. Gastric epithelial stem cells strongly expressed ST6Gal-I, suggesting a novel biomarker of stemness. In contrast, organoid-derived epithelial monolayers expressed markedly reduced ST6Gal-I and underwent TNF-induced, caspase-mediated apoptosis, consistent with homeostasis. Conversely, epithelial monolayers generated from gastric cancer stem cells retained high levels of ST6Gal-I and resisted TNF-induced apoptosis, supporting prolonged survival. Protection from TNF-induced apoptosis was dependent on ST6Gal-I overexpression, since forced ST6Gal-I overexpression in normal gastric stem cell-differentiated monolayers inhibited TNF-induced apoptosis, and cleavage of &#945;2,6-linked sialic acids from gastric cancer organoid-derived monolayers restored susceptibility to TNF-induced apoptosis. These findings implicate upregulated ST6Gal-I expression in blocking homeostatic epithelial cell apoptosis in gastric cancer pathogenesis, suggesting a mechanism for prolonged epithelioid tumor cell survival.","Alexander, Katie L; Serrano, Carolina A; Chakraborty, Asmi; Nearing, Marie; Council, Leona N; Riquelme, Arnoldo; Garrido, Marcelo; Bellis, Susan L; Smythies, Lesley E; Smith, Phillip D",J. biol. chem,190,33

This quantity represented Gilead's then full production capacity for July and 90% of its capacity for August and September. Similar deals are evident around access to proposed vaccines for COVID-19, and such deals are only likely to increase. These attempts to secure preferential access to medicines and vaccines, so-called vaccine/treatment nationalism, jeopardise supplies of life-saving treatments and vaccines available elsewhere, and jeopardise global equitable distribution of such vaccines/treatments more generally. Much of the focus to date has been on States' role in negotiating such deals. However, such developments also demonstrate the power patent holders have in controlling access to life-saving healthcare, determining who obtains access first and at what price. This article argues that the extent of control currently given to patent holders for COVID-19 must be questioned. This article demonstrates that patents have significant implications for healthcare acting as private governance tools over patented inventions. It is only by greater probing of patent holders' role in delivering access to medicines, diagnostics and vaccines for COVID-19 that equitable global equitable access can be achieved.","McMahon, Aisling",J. med. ethics,190,16

The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the arterial ligation with cotton thread, and also with one, two or three titanium clips. Consequently, eigthy arteries of twenty mongrels dogs were utilized. Each of the dog had their right and left axillary arteries, as well as the rigth and left femoral arteries used. Those arteries had been previously distributed in 4 groups, being previously chosen by lot and in turns. After arterial dissection and ligation, the arteries were submitted to 100 mmHg and 300 mmHg of pressure, and a pulsation rate of 70 bumps per minute, that was obtained by an arterial pressure simulation machine. There was a liquid escape from 3 arteries, which belonged to the one-titanio-clip group. This escape, that is statistically significant occurred in less than 15 minutes. Furthermore, the results show that the arterial ligation with one titanio clip has a great probability of escaping, contrary to the ligation done with cotton thread, as well as the ones done with two or three titanium clips. Therefore, there is no difference between the ligation with cotton thread and two or three titânio clips, if they are submited to 300 mmHg of pressure and a pulsation rate of 70 bumps per minutes.","Leite Soares, Adriano; Goldenberg, Saul; Ferreira Novo, Neil; Antônio de Paula Lima, Cirilo",Acta cir. bras.,190,5

This paper describes the precopulatory mating behavior of A. curvicauda and elucidates how intrasexual selection affects the mate selection process. We studied the precopulatory mating behavior of dominant and subordinate males and ethograms were devised. The effect of hierarchy was studied in non-choice and choice experiments. Male's repertoire includes 15 behavioral elements, 12 precopulatory, one mating, and two postcopulatory (tandem and encounter). In non-choice experiments, dominant and subordinate males were accepted by females, but when females had the opportunity to choose among males, dominant males were significantly preferred over subordinate ones. The presence of a rival male modified the courting behavior of males and agonistic behavior among males was observed before and during mating.","Salmerón-Muñiz, Nancy Natividad; Arzuffi, René; Robledo-Quintos, Norma; Jiménez-Pérez, Alfredo",Sci Rep,190,16

As of May 10th, 2020, a total of over 4 million COVID-19 cases and 280,000 deaths have been reported globally, reflecting the raised infectivity and severity of this virus. Amongst hospitalised COVID-19 patients, there is a high prevalence of established cardiovascular disease (CVD). There is evidence showing that COVID-19 may exacerbate cardiovascular risk factors and preexisting CVD or may lead to cardiovascular complications. With intensive care units operating at maximum capacity and such staggering mortality rates reported, it is imperative during this time-sensitive COVID-19 outbreak to identify patients with an increased risk of adverse outcomes and/or myocardial injury. Preliminary findings from COVID-19 studies have shown the association of biomarkers of acute cardiac injury and coagulation with worse prognosis. While these biomarkers are recognised for CVD, there is emerging prospect that they may aid prognosis in COVID-19, especially in patients with cardiovascular comorbidities or risk factors that predispose to worse outcomes. Consequently, the aim of this review is to identify cardiovascular prognostic factors associated with morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 and to highlight considerations for incorporating laboratory testing of biomarkers of cardiovascular performance in COVID-19 to optimise outcomes.","Aboughdir, Maryam; Kirwin, Thomas; Abdul Khader, Ashiq; Wang, Brian",Viruses,190,32

PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: We examined three main outcomes; health service use (outpatient and inpatient care), financial burden (catastrophic health expenditure) and productivity loss (labour participation, days primary activity missed, days confined in bed). We applied multilevel mixed-effects regression models to assess the associations between NCD multimorbidity and outcome variables, RESULTS: Women were more likely to have NCD multimorbidity than men and the prevalence of NCD multimorbidity increased with higher socioeconomic status. NCD multimorbidity was associated with a higher number of outpatient visits (compared with those without NCD, incidence rate ratio (IRR) 4.25, 95% CI 3.33 to 5.42 for individuals with >3 NCDs) and inpatient visits (IRR 3.68, 95% CI 2.21 to 6.12 for individuals with >3 NCDs). NCD multimorbidity was also associated with a greater likelihood of experiencing catastrophic health expenditure (for >3 NCDs, adjusted OR (aOR) 1.69, 95% CI 1.02 to 2.81) and lower participation in the labour force (aOR 0.23, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.33) compared with no NCD. CONCLUSIONS: NCD multimorbidity is associated with substantial direct and indirect costs to individuals, households and the wider society. Our study highlights the importance of preparing health systems for addressing the burden of multimorbidity in low-income and middle-income countries.","Marthias, Tiara; Anindya, Kanya; Ng, Nawi; McPake, Barbara; Atun, Rifat; Arfyanto, Hafiz; Hulse, Emily Sg; Zhao, Yang; Jusril, Hafizah; Pan, Tianxin; Ishida, Marie; Lee, John Tayu",BMJ Open,190,26

On January 23 in Wuhan, and later in all other cities of the country, there were taken measures to control the spread of the virus through quarantine measures. This article focused on East China and attempted to assess comprehensively the environmental impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. This study analyzed satellite observational data of sulfur dioxide (SO 2), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), carbon monoxide (CO) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) in the period before the outbreak of the epidemic and during the implementation of preventive measures and control of COVID-19, as well as compared it with the data obtained in the same period of 2019. The results of the analysis showed that the COVID-19 lockdown improved air quality in the short term, but as soon as coal consumption at power plants and refineries returned to normal levels due to the resumption of their work, pollution levels returned to their previous level. The levels of CO and NO 2showed the most significant decrease (20 and 30%), since they were mainly associated with a decrease in economic growth and transport restrictions that led to a change in energy consumption and a reduction in emissions. This study can complement the scientific community and environmental protection policy makers, not only to assess the impact of outbreak on air quality, but also for its effectiveness as a simple alternative program of action to improve air quality.","Filonchyk, Mikalai; Hurynovich, Volha; Yan, Haowen; Gusev, Andrei; Shpilevskaya, Natallia",Aerosol Air Qual.

In this health emergency, a key element has been and still is the need for information, which has become a daily concern for many people. Social media represent powerful tools for searching and gathering health-related information, thus becoming a new place where health authorities need to be present to disseminate information of preventive measures like vaccines against COVID-19, as well as try to block information against these public health measures. The main goal of this study was to analyze the role that healthcare professionals have in Twitter to support the campaign of public institutions on vaccination against COVID-19. To address this study, an analysis of the messages sent on Twitter containing the hashtag #yomevacuno, between 12 December 2020 was developed using the NodeXL software (Social Media Research Foundation, Redwood, CA, USA), focusing on content analysis of tweets and users’ accounts to identify healthcare professionals. The results show that healthcare professionals represent only 11.38% of users, being responsible for 6.35% of impressions generated by the network #yomevacuno. We can observe that traffic information generated by healthcare professionals is not significant in comparison with institutions (p = 0.633), but it is compared to common users (p = 0.0014). The most active healthcare professionals were pharmacists (40.17%), nurses (27.17%), and physicians (12.14%). Their activity (90.43% of messages) was mainly focused on sharing messages generated by other users’ accounts. From original content generated by healthcare professionals, only 78.95% had a favorable storytelling on the vaccine, but without sharing information about vaccines or vaccination. As a conclusion for this study, the participation of healthcare professionals in the dissemination and generation of information within the #yomevacuno communication strategy, led by the Spanish Ministry of Health, has been scarce. We emphasize the need to enhance communication skills in social networks to support public health campaigns through these increasingly important social media.","Herrera-Peco, Ivan Jiménez-Gómez Beatriz Peña Deudero Juan José Benitez De Gracia Elvira Ruiz-Núñez Carlos",Healthcare,190,23

Non-natural disaster is called Corona Virus Desease (COVID-19), which is a large family of viruses that can attack humans and animals that are currently a global pandemic. Humans usually cause respiratory infections, ranging from the common cold to serious illnesses such as MERS and SARS. COVID-19 itself is a new type of coronavirus found in humans and in the Wuhan area, Hubei Province, China in 2019. To assist medical staff in early detecting symptoms experienced by patients and facilitate the administration of hospital records, one of them was made an expert system that could detect this COVID-19 early with the Certainty Factor (CF) method. This expert system mimics similar symptoms experienced by COVID-19 patients and will be grouped into several patient statuses. Patients who experience serious symptoms will be grouped into Patients Under Supervision (PDP) and patients who are considered to have milder symptoms will be grouped into Insider Oversight status (ODP) while those who experience symptoms that are outside of the main symptoms will be classified into Non Suspect (NON) status . From 152 patient data inputted in this study, 114 ODP results with an average CF value of 91.38%, 36 PDP with an average CF value of 98.25% and 2 NONs with an average CF value of 40%.

Pregnant women are one such group of individuals who are at in increased risk of contracting COVID-19, due to their immunocompromised state. In South Africa, HIV infection and pre-eclampsia are the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality, with South Africa being the HIV epicentre of the world. The relationship between COVID-19 superimposed on HIV infection and preeclampsia is complex and uncertain due to their different immune responses, and therefore requires further research. RECENT FINDINGS: Notably evidence suggests that pregnant women with chronic comorbidities (HIV and pre-eclampsia) may be at a greater risk of contracting or encountering complications from COVID-19. Maternal stress, during a pandemic, as well as home delivery have become potential options for pregnant woman. Nonetheless there is currently a paucity of information on the combined effect of COVID-19 in HIV-associated preeclampsia. Understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19 could potentially aid in developing effective treatment strategies for COVID-19 in HIV associated preeclampsia. This review article presents a comprehensive analysis of the current data in relation to COVID-19 and its effect on pregnant women, including symptoms, pathogenesis and the possible risk of vertical transmission.

Here, the desolvation of H3O+ is achieved by using anatase TiO2 as anodes, enabling the H+ intercalation with a strain-free characteristic. Density functional theory calculations show that the desolvation effects are dependent on the facets of anatase TiO2. Anatase TiO2 (001) surface, a highly reactive surface, impels the desolvation of H3O+ into H+.

For 3 days after exposure, the estimated relative reduction is 15.7% but results are not statistically conclusive and for 4 or more days after exposure there is no statistical evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective in reducing the appearance of symptoms.

Virion structure is of interest, not only in the context of virus assembly, but also because pleomorphic variations may correlate with infectivity and pathogenicity. Detailed images of virus morphology often rely on electron microscopy, which is generally low throughput and limited in molecular identification. We have used fluorescence super-resolution microscopy combined with a rapid automated analysis pipeline to image many thousands of individual influenza virions, gaining information on their size, morphology and the distribution of membrane-embedded and internal proteins. This large-scale analysis revealed that influenza particles can be reliably characterised by length, that no spatial frequency patterning of the surface glycoproteins occurs, and that RNPs are preferentially located towards filament ends within Archetti bodies. Our analysis pipeline is versatile and can be adapted for use on multiple other pathogens, as demonstrated by its application for the size analysis of SARS-CoV-2. The ability to gain nanoscale structural information from many thousands of viruses in just a single experiment is valuable for the study of virus assembly mechanisms, host cell interactions and viral immunology, and should be able to contribute to the development of viral vaccines, anti-viral strategies and diagnostics.","McMahon, Andrew; Andrews, Rebecca; Ghani, Sohail V; Cordes, Thorben; Kapanidis, Achillefs N; Robb, Nicole C",,190,24

Assertions in the literature suggest that respiratory disorders due to COVID-19 commonly present with pneumonia-like symptoms which are radiologically confirmed as opacities. Radiology serves as an adjunct to the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction test for confirmation and evaluating disease progression. While computed tomography (CT) imaging is more specific than chest X-rays (CXR), its use is limited due to cross-contamination concerns. CXR imaging is commonly used in high-demand situations, placing a significant burden on radiology services. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) has been suggested to alleviate this burden. However, there is a dearth of sufficient training data for developing image-based AI tools. We propose increasing training data for recognizing COVID-19 pneumonia opacities using weakly labeled data augmentation. This follows from a hypothesis that the COVID-19 manifestation would be similar to that caused by other viral pathogens affecting the lungs. We expand the training data distribution for supervised learning through the use of weakly labeled CXR images, automatically pooled from publicly available pneumonia datasets, to classify them into those with bacterial or viral pneumonia opacities. Next, we use these selected images in a stage-wise, strategic approach to train convolutional neural network-based algorithms and compare against those trained with nonaugmented data. Weakly labeled data augmentation expands the learned feature space in an attempt to encompass variability in unseen test distributions, enhance inter-class discrimination, and reduce the generalization error. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that simple weakly labeled data augmentation (Acc: 0.5555 and Acc: 0.6536) is better than baseline non-augmented training (Acc: 0.2885 and Acc: 0.5028) in identifying COVID-19 manifestations as viral pneumonia. Interestingly, adding COVID-19 CXRs to simple weakly labeled augmented training data significantly improves the performance (Acc: 0.7095 and Acc: 0.8889), suggesting that COVID-19, though viral in origin, creates a uniquely different presentation in CXRs compared with other viral pneumonia manifestations.","Rajaraman, Sivaramakrishnan; Antani, Sameer",Diagn.,190,1

Therefore, increasing the pool of senior faculty who wish to become guides and advocates for emerging scientists from HU populations is an essential step toward creating new pathways for their career advancement. As a step toward achieving this goal, we created a novel eight-hour intervention on Culturally Aware Mentoring (CAM), a program of the National Research Mentoring Network (NRMN) targeted to faculty and administrators. A previous report of surveys at the end of the CAM sessions revealed substantial awareness and knowledge gains, with participants expressing intentions to use and implement new skills they had learned. In this paper, we provide the results of our thematic analysis of qualitative interviews with academic administrators and faculty, 18-24 months after participation in CAM. Interviews were designed to determine: 1) What changes in self-perceptions and interactions occurred as a result of participation in CAM? 2) What specific components of CAM are associated with changes in individual beliefs and practices? 3) How did participants actively make changes after the CAM workshop? 4) What barriers or challenges do participants encounter after the CAM intervention? The results demonstrate the lasting influences of CAM on participants' awareness of cultural differences, their assumptions about and approaches toward interactions with colleagues and students, and their efforts to change their behaviors to promote inclusive practices in their mentoring and teaching of HU students in STEM. Our findings provide evidence that CAM can be incorporated into existing mentor training programs designed to improve the confidence and capacity of senior research faculty mentors to make culturally-informed, scholar-centered decisions to more deliberately recognize and respond to cultural differences within their mentoring and collegial relationships.","Womack, Veronica Y; Wood, Christine V; House, Stephanie C; Quinn, Sandra C; Thomas, Stephen B; McGee, Richard; Byars-Winston, Angela",PLoS One,190,19

Orv Hetil. 2021; 162(16): 611-614. Summary. Mortality of COVID-19 is increased when certain co-morbidities, among others advanced malignancies are present. Deleterious effect of cytotoxic therapy, related to its immunosuppressive effect, may also be hypothesised. However, postponing or cancelling oncologic treatment, especially in younger patients with advanced and more aggressive tumors may worsen the prognosis. The case of a 39-year-old female patient is presented, who was diagnosed with loco-regionally advanced breast cancer during the pandemic. Primary systemic chemotherapy was started. The patient presented with acute respiratory tract symptoms during the fifth cycle and subsequently SARS-CoV-2 infection was diagnosed. Chemotherapy was cancelled. Symptoms resolved in three days after diagnosis. SARS-CoV-2 PCR remained positive up to day 43. Antihormonal therapy was introduced on day 19 and she underwent mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection on day 51. Chemotherapy was reset postoperatively on day 82 with prophylactic G-CSF protection. No adverse event was observed throughout the treatment. Cytotoxic chemotherapy and surgery can be successfully delivered in breast cancer patients with prolonged asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 PCR positivity, even without negative swab result. Individual optimisation of the therapy may require deviations from standard protocols. Closer multidisciplinary cooperation may contribute to the minimisation of both oncologic and infectious risks.

The health crisis has not only had an impact on people's own health and on health systems, but has also affected other areas. In the educational context, the lockdown measures implemented by different governments have challenged the learning ecosystem. In the case of higher education in Spain, with a strong attendance factor in most public universities, face-to-face classes were interrupted after a month in the second term, ending the academic year in the online mode. This change has meant a great effort on the teachers' side to transform the face-to-face teaching into the online approach, which in many cases has meant quite a comprehensive new design of the subject, changing the evaluation process and the methodologies used. This work presents a success case of online assessment developed in the Software Engineering I subject of the Degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Salamanca. The objective is to show how the previous use of active methodologies and the integration of educational technologies in classroom-based teaching facilitates the transformation of assessment to an online or blended approach while maintaining a high degree of student involvement and satisfaction. After presenting a comparison between the face-to-face approach and the adaptation to the online approach, an analysis is made of the learning results and student satisfaction concerning previous academic years. The results show that the change of approach has not reduced the satisfaction results obtained in previous courses. In terms of learning outcomes, there is an overall increase in the grades obtained by students in all assessment items.","Garcia-Penalvo, F.

Due to the lack of anti-COVID-19 therapies, decision-makers require timely and accurate data to estimate the incidence of disease and the availability of hospital resources to contain the pandemic. Methods: We adapted an existing model to the local context to forecast COVID-19 incidence and hospital resource use assuming different scenarios: (1) the implementation of quarantine from September 1st to October 15th (average daily growth rate of 2%); (2-3) partial restrictions (at 4% and 8% growth rates); and (4) no restrictions, assuming a 10% growth rate. Previous scenarios with predictions from June to August were also presented. We estimated the number of new cases, diagnostic tests required, and the number of available hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds (with and without ventilators) for each scenario. Results: We estimated 67,700 cases by October 15th when assuming the implementation of a quarantine, 80,400 and 101,500 cases when assuming partial restrictions at 4% and 8% infection rates, respectively, and 208,500 with no restrictions. According to different scenarios, the estimated demand for reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests ranged from 202,000 to 1,610,600 between September 1st and October 15th. The model predicted depletion of hospital and ICU beds by September 20th if all restrictions were to be lifted and the infection growth rate increased to 10%. Conclusion: Slowly lifting social distancing restrictions and reopening the economy is not expected to result in full resource depletion by October if the daily growth rate is maintained below 8%. Increasing the number of available beds provides a safeguard against slightly higher infection rates. Predictive models can be iteratively used to obtain nuanced predictions to aid decision-making.","Iragorri, Nicolas; Gómez-Restrepo, Carlos; Barrett, Kali; Herrera, Socrates; Hurtado, Isabel; Khan, Yasin; Mac, Stephen; Naimark, David; Pechlivanoglou, Petros; Rosselli, Diego; Toro, Dilian; Villamizar, Pedro; Ximenes, Raphael; Zapata, Helmer; Sander, Beate",Colomb Med (Cali),190,20

In the case of Colombia, a series of measures focused on isolation and remote services provision were introduced in a context marked by health inequities. This article reviews the theoretical and normative references on primary care interventions in the Colombian response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A literature review was conducted in PubMed, LILACS, MEDLINE, and official documents and regulations issued in Colombia, the World Health Organization, and the Pan American Health Organization. A narrative synthesis was done of 33 documents based on their contribution to the implementation of primary care in Colombia and their role in the pandemic. Results: The information was organized into two categories: Actions taken in Colombia in response to COVID-19 and Opportunities in primary care in response to COVID-19. Colombias actions were contrasted with world experience. Better pandemic control was found in countries that adopted primary care as a response. Primary care has strengthened the handling of the pandemic through community action, the provision of coordinated services, mental health inclusion, and the adoption of telemedicine processes. Conclusions: In Colombia, primary care is presented as an opportunity to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic and the problems and needs derived from this situation. However, despite the above, there is resistance in the country to adopt this type of approach and complement the hospital-centric model to face the pandemic.","Hernández Rincón, Erwin Hernando; Pimentel González, Juan Pablo; Aramendiz Narváez, Manuel Felipe; Araujo Tabares, Raúl Andrés; Roa González, Julián Mateo",Medwave,190,14

Una de las estrategias para el manejo es la reconversión de camas y servicios clínicos. OBJETIVOS: presentar experiencia de un equipo ginecológico en el manejo integral de pacientes no gineco-obstétricas con COVID 19, durante el mes de junio de 2020 en un hospital público de la Región Metropolitana. MÉTODOS: Estudio de corte transversal observacional, descriptivo. Se consideró el total de pacientes adultos hombres y mujeres sin patología gineco-obstétrica con COVID 19 ingresados al puerperio del Hospital Santiago Oriente, obteniéndose datos clínicos y demográficos a través del registro interno de la unidad y del sistema de información de red asistencial. RESULTADOS: Ingresaron 82 pacientes, 32 mujeres y 50 hombres, promedio de edad 64. El promedio de días de hospitalización fue 5, con diagnóstico de ingreso principal neumonía viral por COVID-19. Las comorbilidades frecuentes fueron hipertensión arterial sistémica y diabetes mellitus. La complicación más frecuente fue el tromboembolismo pulmonar agudo. Hubo una alta cobertura de entrega de información vía telefónica a familiares. De los 82 ingresos, 54 pacientes egresaron a su domicilio. El resto a otras unidades dentro de la institución, centros de menor complejidad o residencias sanitarias. Una paciente sexo femenino de 75 años fallece a causa de descompensación de patologias de base secundario a neumonia por Staphylococus aereus. En ella, se descarta la infección por COVID 19 dado tres exámenes por reacción de polimerasa en cadena negativos realizado antes y durante su hospitalización. CONCLUSIONES: Esta experiencia constituyó un desafío para todo el equipo de salud gineco-obstétrico, considerando que nos enfrentamos a otro tipo de pacientes y a una patología nueva. Los resultados médicos son promisorios, la experiencia humana y sentido de trabajo en equipo fue extraordinario.","Del Pozo, Francisca; Soto, Constanza; Véliz, Valeria; Escobar, Paula",Rev. chil. obstet. ginecol.

The research intent was to discover whether pathogenic or nonpathogenic species cause a high rate of symptomless Entamoeba infections. Stool samples were microscopically examined, and the 18S-rRNA gene was targeted utilizing the nested PCR technique in the positive specimens. Initial results based on morphological features showed that the Entamoeba prevalence rate was 7.4%. Significantly higher rates of infections were seen in females than in males and in low-income people than in moderate-income people. The incidence rates among the asymptomatic individuals, as determined by molecular analysis, were as follows: E. histolytica - 6%, E. dispar - 4.3%, and E. moshkovskii - 0.3%. Of all the Entamoeba positive samples, a single infection with E. histolytica was identified in 41.4% samples; the single infection with E. dispar in 18.6% samples, 35.7% samples had mixed infections with two Entamoeba species, and 4.3% had mixed infections with three species. The current study concluded that 7.4% of healthy people, who live in the endemic area under investigation, carry Entamoeba species asymptomatically. Additionally, the majority of asymptomatic Entamoeba infections were caused by the pathogenic E. histolytica (81.4%) compared to E. dispar (58.6%), and E. moshkovskii with the lowest rate of infection. Single and co-infections with E. histolytica and E. dispar were noted.

During the early months of the pandemic, when little was known about the virus, the acute hypoxemic respiratory failure it caused did not appear to fit conveniently or consistently into our classification of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This not only re-ignited a half-century's long simmering debate over taxonomy, but also fueled similar debates over how PEEP and lung-protective ventilation should be titrated, as well as the appropriate role of non-invasive ventilation in ARDS. Furthermore, COVID-19 ignited other debates on emerging concepts such as ARDS phenotypes and patient self-inflicted lung injury from vigorous spontaneous breathing. Over a year later these early perplexities have receded into the background without having been reviewed or resolved. With a full year of evidence having been published this narrative review systematically analyzes whether or not COVID-19 associated respiratory failure is essentially ARDS, with perhaps a somewhat different course of presentation. This includes a review of the severity of hypoxemia and derangements in pulmonary mechanics, PEEP requirements, recruitment potential, the ability to achieve lung-protective ventilation goals, duration of mechanical ventilation, associated mortality, and response to non-invasive ventilation. It also reviews the concepts of ARDS phenotypes and patient self-inflicted lung injury as these are crucial to understanding the contentious debate over the nature and management of COVID-19.","Kallet, Richard H",Respir. care,190,1

As previously reported, in June 2020, after the first peak of infections, we determined that 8.5% and 9.0% of the participants in Wei{beta}enkirchen and surrounding communities in the Wachau region were positive for SARS-CoV-2-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin A (IgA) antibodies, respectively. Here, we present novel data obtained eight months later (February 2021) from Wei{beta}enkirchen, after the second peak of infection, with 25.0% (138/552) and 23.6% (130/552) of participants that are positive for IgG and IgA, respectively. In participants with previous IgG/IgA positivity (June 2020), we observed a 24% reduction in IgG levels, whereas the IgA levels remained stable in February 2021. This subgroup was further analyzed for SARS-CoV-2-induced T cell activities. Although 76% (34/45) and 76% (34/45) of IgG positive and IgA positive participants, respectively, showed specific T cell activities, those were not significantly correlated with the levels of IgG or IgA. Thus, the analyses of antibodies cannot surrogate the measurement of T cell activities. For a comprehensive view on SARS-CoV-2-triggered immune responses, the measurement of different classes of antibodies should be complemented with the determination of T cell activities.","Rebholz, Heike; Braun, Ralf J.; Saha, Titas; Harzer, Oliver; Schneider, Miriam; Ladage, Dennis",,190,29

Results From a Nationwide Veterans' Affairs Cohort Study,14.763445,10.598151,2020,"March 21, 2020 was the ridgeline between the growth of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic wave in Italy and the start of its decline. We analyzed the epidemic patterns from March 1 to June 30. There was a progressive drop of cases from March (104,710) to April (94,888), May (25,705) and June (8110). Likewise, after a slight increase of deaths in April (14,804) compared to March (12,396), a considerable decline occurred in May (5170) and June (1464). Doubling times of cumulative cases grew from 2 to 6 days until March 20 to 2 weeks up to April 5, and thereafter no further doubling occurred until June 30. There was a striking North-South gradient of both cases and deaths. At the end of June, the nine Northern Italian regions or provinces, five central regions, and seven southern regions had contributed to the 81.1%, 12.4%, and 6.5% of the 240,578 national cases, respectively. Lombardy, the most populous region, was by far the most heavily affected one, accounting for the 39.0% of the national cases occurring over the analyzed 4-month period. However, in relative terms, it was preceded by Aosta Valley, the least populous region, less than 1% of the population of both regions having been affected by cases of COVID-19. The curves showing the ratio of daily cumulative cases and deaths to those of the previous day tended to flatten with time by approaching the zero growth but without reaching it, which documents a persisting circulation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in the Italian territory.","De Flora, Silvio; La Maestra, Sebastiano",J. med. virol,190,1

Where once individuals were concerned about the privacy of their conversations and financial information, the digitization of health data has created new challenges for those responsible for ensuring that patient information remains secure and private. Coupled with the lack of updated, overarching legislation, a critical gap exists between advancements in technology, consumer informatics tools and privacy regulations. Almost twenty years after the HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) compliance date, the healthcare industry continues to seek solutions to privacy challenges absent formal contemporary law. Since HIPAA, a few attempts have been made to control specific aspects of health information including genetic information and use of technology however none were visionary enough to address issues seen in today's digital data focused healthcare environment. The proliferation of digital health data, trends in data use, increased use of telehealth applications due to COVID-19 pandemic and the consumer's participatory role in healthcare all create new challenges not covered by the existing legal framework. Modern efforts to address this dilemma have emerged in state and international law though the United States healthcare industry continues to operate under a law written two decades ago. As technology continues to advance at a rapid pace along with consumers playing a greater role in the management of their healthcare through digital health the privacy guidance provided by federal law must also shift to reflect the new reality.","Theodos, Kim; Sittig, Scott",Perspect Health Inf Manag,190,1

Their improvement would reduce inequalities among various Communities/Districts or groups of Communities. A Community health index (CHI) in this regard is estimated to explore inequality ratio, inequality slope, and spatial analysis of inequalities among all Communities at regional and geographical levels. METHODS: Data from Pakistan Social and Living Standard Measurement (PSLM) survey, Round-VI, 2014-15 were used to construct CHI. The index was constructed in two steps. In the first step, the study indicators were standardized while in the second step, the standardized indicators were aggregated into a single metric by applying non-linear Geometric Mean formula. RESULTS: The inequality ratio of 16.59 estimated for Pakistan was found to be higher than the ratio of Atlanta city, GA (5.92), whereas, a lower slope coefficient was estimated for Pakistan than Atlanta city, GA (0.38 < 0.54). This ratio of disparity was also found to be lower for urban regions as compared to rural (7.78 < 17.54). While the slope coefficient was slightly higher for urban regions (0.45 > 0.43). The results of the spatial analysis revealed different patterns of inequalities. A cluster of healthy districts was found in Punjab province, whereas districts from Baluchistan had made a bunch of deprived/unhealthy districts in terms of CHI scores. Besides, separate maps for all provinces showed that capital districts of all provinces were relatively well-off/developed. CONCLUSION: The instant results concluded that inequalities in access to health and health-related indicators exist across countries as well as across geographical regions. To reduce or eradicate these inequalities, government and public health workers are recommended to set priorities based on access to composite index.","Khan, Sami Ullah; Hussain, Ijaz",BMC Public Health,190,13

The primary problem in diagnosing COVID-19 patients is the shortage and reliability of testing kits, due to the quick spread of the virus, medical practitioners are facing difficulty in identifying the positive cases. The second real-world problem is to share the data among the hospitals globally while keeping in view the privacy concerns of the organizations. Building a collaborative model and preserving privacy are the major concerns for training a global deep learning model. This paper proposes a framework that collects a small amount of data from different sources (various hospitals) and trains a global deep learning model using blockchain-based federated learning. Blockchain technology authenticates the data and federated learning trains the model globally while preserving the privacy of the organization. First, we propose a data normalization technique that deals with the heterogeneity of data as the data is gathered from different hospitals having different kinds of Computed Tomography (CT) scanners. Secondly, we use Capsule Network-based segmentation and classification to detect COVID-19 patients. Thirdly, we design a method that can collaboratively train a global model using blockchain technology with federated learning while preserving privacy. Additionally, we collected real-life COVID-19 patients&#x2019;data open to the research community. The proposed framework can utilize up-to-date data which improves the recognition of CT images.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate maternal and perinatal outcomes in high- and low-risk pregnancies complicated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection. STUDY DESIGN: This was a multinational retrospective cohort study involving women with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection from 76 centers from 25 countries in Europe, the United States, South America, Asia, and Australia from April 4, 2020, to October 28, 2020. The primary outcome was a composite measure of maternal mortality and morbidity, including admission to the intensive care unit, use of mechanical ventilation, or death. The secondary outcome was a composite measure of adverse perinatal outcome, including miscarriage, fetal loss, neonatal and perinatal death, and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. All outcomes were assessed in high- and low-risk pregnancies. Pregnancies were considered high risk in case of either preexisting chronic medical conditions in pregnancy or obstetrical disorders occurring in pregnancy. The Fisher exact test and logistic regression analysis were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 887 singleton pregnancies who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction of nasal and pharyngeal swab specimens were included in the study. The risk of composite adverse maternal outcomes was higher in high-risk pregnancies than in low-risk pregnancies (odds ratio, 1.52; 95% confidence interval, 1.03-2.24; P=.035). In addition, women carrying high-risk pregnancies were at higher risk of hospital admission (odds ratio, 1.48; 95% confidence interval, 1.07-2.04; P=.002), presence of severe respiratory symptoms (odds ratio, 2.13; 95% confidence interval, 0.41-3.21; P=.001), admission to the intensive care unit (odds ratio, 2.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.42-4.88), and invasive mechanical ventilation (odds ratio, 2.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-5.94; P=.002). When exploring perinatal outcomes, high-risk pregnancies were at high risk of adverse perinatal outcomes (odds ratio, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.15-2.72; P=.009). However, such association was mainly because of the higher incidence of miscarriage in high-risk pregnancies compared with that in low-risk pregnancies (5.3% vs 1.6%, P=.008); furthermore, there was no difference in other explored outcomes between the 2 study groups. At logistic regression analysis, maternal age (odds ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.22; P=.023) and high-risk pregnancy (odds ratio, 4.21; 95% confidence interval, 3.90-5.11; P<.001) were independently associated with adverse maternal outcomes. CONCLUSION: High-risk pregnancies complicated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection were at higher risk of adverse maternal outcomes than low-risk pregnancies complicated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection.","D039,; Antonio, Francesco; Sen, Cihat; Mascio, Daniele Di; Galindo, Alberto; Villalain, Cecilia; Herraiz, Ignacio; Arisoy, Resul; Ovayolu, Ali; Eroglu, Hasan; Canales, Manuel Guerra; Ladella, Subhashini; Cojocaru, Liviu; Turan, Ozhan; Turan, Sifa; Hadar, Eran; Brzezinski-Sinai, Noa A; Dollinger, Sarah; Uyaniklar, Ozlem; Ocakouglu, Sakine Rahimli; Atak, Zeliha; Premru-Srsen, Tanja; Kornhauser-Cerar, Lilijana; Druskovic, Mirjam; Ples, Liana; Gündüz, Reyhan; Agaçayak, Elif; Schvartzman, Javier Alfonso; Malbran, Mercedes Negri; Liberati, Marco; Sebastiano, Francesca Di; Oronzi, Ludovica; Cerra, Chiara; Buca, Danilo; Cagnacci, Angelo; Ramone, Arianna; Barra, Fabio; Carosso, Andrea; Benedetto, Chiara; Cosma, Stefano; Pintiaux, Axelle; Daelemans, Caroline; Costa, Elena; Özel, Aysegül; Muhçu, Murat; Lopez, Jesús S Jimenez; Alvarado, Clara; Piqueras, Anna Luengo; Oliva, Dolores Esteban; Schera, Giovanni Battista Luca; Volpe, Nicola",Am J Obstet Gynecol MFM,190,20

To understand the pathophysiology of COVID-19 infection, it is therefore necessary to understand cell function during hypoxia. We investigated aspects of human monocyte activation under hypoxic conditions. HMGB1 is an alarmin released by stressed cells. Under normoxic conditions, HMGB1 activates interferon regulatory factor (IRF)5 and nuclear factor-&#954;B in monocytes, leading to expression of type I interferon (IFN) and inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor &#945;, and interleukin 1ß, respectively. When hypoxic monocytes are activated by HMGB1, they produce proinflammatory cytokines but fail to produce type I IFN. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#945;, induced by hypoxia, functions as a direct transcriptional repressor of IRF5 and IRF3. As hypoxia is a stressor that induces secretion of HMGB1 by epithelial cells, hypoxia establishes a microenvironment that favors monocyte production of inflammatory cytokines but not IFN. These findings have implications for the pathogenesis of COVID-19.","Peng, Travis; Du, Shin-Yi; Son, Myoungsun; Diamond, Betty",Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A,190,16

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We construct the X-ray imaging data from two publicly available sources, which include 5508 chest x-ray images across 2874 patients with four classes: normal, bacterial pneumonia, non-COVID-19 viral pneumonia, and COVID-19. To identify COVID-19, we propose a Focal Loss Based Neural Ensemble Network (FLANNEL), a flexible module to ensemble several convolutional neural network (CNN) models and fuse with a focal loss for accurate COVID-19 detection on class imbalance data. RESULTS: FLANNEL consistently outperforms baseline models on COVID-19 identification task in all metrics. Compared with the best baseline, FLANNEL shows a higher macro-F1 score with 6% relative increase on Covid-19 identification task where it achieves 0.7833± 0.07 in Precision, 0.8609± 0.03 in Recall, and 0.8168± 0.03 F1 score. DISCUSSION: Ensemble learning that combines multiple independent basis classifiers can increase the robustness and accuracy. We propose Neural Weighing Module to learn importance weight for each base model and combine them via weighted ensemble to get the final classification results.

Reducing nosocomial infections requires an integrated program of prevention and control using key clinical best care practices. No instrument currently exists that measures these practices in terms of personnel time and material costs. OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate an instrument that would measure nosocomial infection control and prevention best care practice costs, including estimates of human and material resources. METHODS: An evaluation of the literature identified four practices essential for the control of pathogens: hand hygiene, hygiene and sanitation, screening and additional precaution. To reflect time, materials and products used in these practices, our team developed a time and motion guide. Iterations of the guide were assessed in a Delphi technique; content validity was established using the content validity index and reliability was assessed using Kruskall Wallis one-way ANOVA of rank test. RESULTS: Two rounds of Delphi review were required; 88% of invited experts completed the assessment. The final version of the guide contains eight dimensions: Identification [83 items]; Personnel [5 items]; Additional Precautions [1 item]; Hand Hygiene [2 items]; Personal Protective Equipment [14 items]; Screening [4 items]; Cleaning and Disinfection of Patient Care Equipment [33 items]; and Hygiene and Sanitation [24 items]. The content validity index obtained for all dimensions was acceptable (> 80%). Experts statistically agreed on six of the eight dimensions. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: This study developed and validated a new instrument based on expert opinion, the time and motion guide, for the systematic assessment of costs relating to the human and material resources used in nosocomial infection prevention and control.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Twenty-five percent of the men with recent SARS-Cov-2 infections and proven healing were oligo-crypto-azoospermic, despite the absence of virus RNA in semen. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in human semen and its role in virus contagion and semen quality after recovery from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is still unclear. So far, studies evaluating semen quality and the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 in semen of infected or proven recovered men are scarce and included a limited number of participants. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A prospective cross-sectional study on 43 sexually active men who were known to have recovered from SARS-CoV2 was performed. Four biological fluid samples, namely saliva, pre-ejaculation urine, semen and post-ejaculation urine, were tested for the SARS-CoV-2 genome. Female partners were retested if any specimen was found to be SARS-CoV-2 positive. Routine semen analysis and quantification of semen leukocytes and interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels were performed. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Questionnaires including International Index of Erectile Function and Male Sexual Health Questionnaire Short Form were administered to all subjects. The occurrence of virus RNA was evaluated in all the biological fluids collected by RT-PCR. Semen parameters were evaluated according to the World Health Organization manual edition V. Semen IL-8 levels were evaluated by a two-step ELISA method. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: After recovery from COVID-19, 25% of the men studied were oligo-crypto-azoospermic. Of the 11 men with semen impairment, eight were azoospermic and three were oligospermic. A total of 33 patients (76.7%) showed pathological levels of IL-8 in semen. Oligo-crypto-azoospermia was significantly related to COVID-19 severity (p < 0.001). Three patients (7%) tested positive for at least one sample (one saliva; one pre-ejaculation urine; one semen and one post-ejaculation urine), so the next day new nasopharyngeal swabs were collected. The results from these three patients and their partners were all negative for SARS-CoV-2. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Although crypto-azoospermia was found in a high percentage of men who had recovered from COVID-19, clearly exceeding the percentage found in the general population, the previous semen quality of these men was unknown, nor is it known whether a recovery of testicular function was occurring. The low number of enrolled patients may limit the statistical power of study. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in saliva, urine and semen in a small percentage of men who recovered from COVID-19. One-quarter of men who recovered from COVID-19 demonstrated oligo-crypto-azoospermia indicating that an assessment of semen quality should be recommended for men of reproductive age who are affected by COVID-19.

Among the many extra-pulmonary manifestations of COVID-19, recent evidence suggested a possible occurrence of thyroid dysfunction. PURPOSE: The Aim of the present review is to summarize available studies regarding thyroid function alterations in patients with COVID-19 and to overview the possible physio-pathological explanations. CONCLUSIONS: The repercussions of the thyroid of COVID-19 seem to be related, in part, with the occurrence of a ""cytokine storm"" that would, in turn, induce a ""non-thyroidal illness"". Some specific cytokines and chemokines appear to have a direct role on the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis. On the other hand, some authors have observed an increased incidence of a destructive thyroiditis, either subacute or painless, in patients with COVID-19. The hypothesis of a direct infection of the thyroid by SARS-Cov-2 stems from the observation that its receptor, ACE2, is strongly expressed in thyroid tissue. Lastly, it is highly probable that some pharmaceutical agents largely used for the treatment of COVID-19 can act as confounding factors in the laboratory evaluation of thyroid function parameters.","Croce, L; Gangemi, D; Ancona, G; Liboà, F; Bendotti, G; Minelli, L; Chiovato, L",J. endocrinol. invest,190,24

The extent of surgical resection (EOR) at first surgery were evaluated. All cases were assessed based on the 2016 WHO classification. The tumor growing patter, expresses by preoperative &#916;T2T1 MRI index was evaluated. RESULTS: In four cases newly diagnosed DLGG were detected patients in post-partum. Seven women, previously operated for DLGG, experienced pregnancy during the natural history of glioma, and were affected by tumor recurrence after pregnancy. One singular had an incidental LGG not surgically treated, who presented an important tumor growth after pregnancy. Radiological and surgical data were discussed according to literature. CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancy does not seem to have an impact on the survival of women with DLGG. The potential role of pregnancy as risk factor in tumor recurrence is described, however, not proven. In this regard, the association between pregnancy and Tumor recurrence is extremely doubtful, and currently attributable to the simple coincidence. Further multicenter molecular investigations are required to better understand the mechanisms by which the pregnancy, in patients with a pervious surgery for DLGG, may influence tumor regrowth in comparison with the natural history of the disease.","Somma, Teresa; Baiano, Cinzia; Santi, Laura; Sabatino, Giovanni; Della Pepa, Giuseppe Maria; La Rocca, Giuseppe; Cappabianca, Paolo; Olivi, Alessandro; Skrap, Miran; Ius, Tamara",Clin Neurol Neurosurg,190,16

A literature review was performed for articles related to telemedicine. Databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library and Ovid MEDLINE were searched. Three reviewers independently performed article selection based on relevance to our topic. We included all articles between 1990 and 2020 related to telemedicine using the following keywords: 'telemedicine', 'telehealth', 'policy', 'COVID-19', 'regulation', 'rural', 'physical examination', 'future'. A total of 60 articles were identified, and through careful selection we narrowed the final number of articles to 42 based on relevance to our topic. Telemedicine has been rapidly evolving over the past several decades. Issues with regulation and reimbursement have prevented its full immersion into the healthcare system. During the current pandemic, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services have expanded access to telemedicine services. The advantages of telemedicine moving forward include its cost-effectiveness, ability to extend access to specialty services and its potential to help mitigate the looming physician shortage. Disadvantages include lack of available technological resources in certain parts of the country, issues with security of patient data, and challenges in performing the traditional patient examination. It is critically important that changes are made to fully immerse telemedicine services into the healthcare landscape in order to be prepared for future pandemics as well as to reap the benefits of this service in the future.","Kichloo, Asim; Albosta, Michael; Dettloff, Kirk; Wani, Farah; El-Amir, Zain; Singh, Jagmeet; Aljadah, Michael; Chakinala, Raja Chandra; Kanugula, Ashok Kumar; Solanki, Shantanu; Chugh, Savneek",,190,11

For ease of use and universal applicability, surrogate virus neutralization tests (sVNTs) based on antibody-mediated blockage of molecular interactions have been proposed. A surrogate virus neutralization test was established on a label-free immunoassay platform (LF-sVNT). The LF-sVNT analyzes the binding ability of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) after neutralizing RBD with antibodies in serum. The LF-sVNT neutralizing antibody titers (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50]) were determined from serum samples (n = 246) from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients (n = 113), as well as the IgG concentrations and the IgG avidity indices. Although there was variability in the kinetics of the IgG concentrations and neutralizing antibody titers between individuals, there was an initial rise, plateau, and then in some cases a gradual decline at later time points after 40 days after symptom onset. The IgG avidity indices, in the same cases, plateaued after an initial rise and did not show a decline. The LF-sVNT can be a valuable tool in research and clinical laboratories for the assessment of the presence of neutralizing antibodies to COVID-19. This study is the first to provide longitudinal neutralizing antibody titers beyond 200 days post-symptom onset. Despite the decline of IgG concentration and neutralizing antibody titer, IgG avidity index increases, reaches a plateau, and then remains constant up to 8 months postinfection. The decline of antibody neutralization activity can be attributed to the reduction in antibody quantity rather than the deterioration of antibody quality, as measured by antibody avidity.","Luo, Yiqi Ruben; Yun, Cassandra; Chakraborty, Indrani; Wu, Alan H B; Lynch, Kara L",J Clin Microbiol,190,6

This study describes the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on families with children in Canada. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This descriptive study used a nationally representative, cross-sectional survey of adults living in Canada (n=3000) to examine the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcomes among parents with children <18 years old living at home (n=618) were compared with the rest of the sample. Data were collected via an online survey between 14 May to 29 May 2020. OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants reported on changes to their mental health since the onset of the pandemic and sources of stress, emotional responses, substance use patterns and suicidality/self-harm. Additionally, parents identified changes in their interactions with their children, impacts on their children's mental health and sources of support accessed. RESULTS: 44.3% of parents with children <18 years living at home reported worse mental health as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with 35.6% of respondents without children <18 living at home, &#967;2 (1, n=3000)=16.2, p<0.001. More parents compared with the rest of the sample reported increased alcohol consumption (27.7% vs 16.1%, &#967;2 (1, n=3000)=43.8, p<0.001), suicidal thoughts/feelings (8.3% vs 5.2%, &#967;2 (1, n=3000)=8.0, p=0.005) and stress about being safe from physical/emotional domestic violence (11.5% vs 7.9%, &#967;2 (1, n=3000)=8.1, p=0.005). 24.8% (95% CI 21.4 to 28.4) of parents reported their children's mental health had worsened since the pandemic. Parents also reported more frequent negative as well as positive interactions with their children due to the pandemic (eg, more conflicts, 22.2% (95% CI 19.0 to 25.7); increased feelings of closeness, 49.7% (95% CI 45.7 to 53.7)). CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies that families with children <18 at home have experienced deteriorated mental health due to the pandemic. Population-level responses are required to adequately respond to families' diverse needs and mitigate the potential for widening health and social inequities for parents and children.","Gadermann, Anne C; Thomson, Kimberly C; Richardson, Chris G; Gagné, Monique; McAuliffe, Corey; Hirani, Saima; Jenkins, Emily",BMJ Open,190,6

RCTs isolate the effect of the treatment from that of unwanted (confounding) co-occurring effects. But they may struggle with inclusion biases, and thus lack external validity. On the other hand, large observational samples are often more representative of the target population but can conflate confounding effects with the treatment of interest. In this paper, we review the growing literature on methods for causal inference on combined RCTs and observational studies, striving for the best of both worlds. We first discuss identification and estimation methods that improve generalizability of RCTs using the representativeness of observational data. Classical estimators include weighting, difference between conditional outcome models, and doubly robust estimators. We then discuss methods that combine RCTs and observational data to improve (conditional) average treatment effect estimation, handling possible unmeasured confounding in the observational data. We also connect and contrast works developed in both the potential outcomes framework and the structural causal model framework.

KEY FINDINGS: Medical Imaging plays an important auxiliary role in the diagnosis of Covid-19 patients, mainly those most seriously affected. Practice differs widely among different countries, mainly due to the variability of access to resources (viral testing and imaging equipment, specialised staff, protective equipment). It has been now well-documented that chest radiographs should be the first-line imaging tool and chest CT should only be reserved for critically ill patients, or when chest radiograph and clinical presentation may be inconclusive. CONCLUSION: As radiographers work on the frontline, they should be aware of the potential risks associated with Covid-19 and engage in optimal strategies to reduce these. Their role in vetting, conducting and often reporting the imaging examinations is vital, as well as their contribution in patient safety and care. Medical Imaging should be limited to critically ill patients, and where it may have an impact on the patient management plan. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: At the time of publication, this review offers the most up-to-date recommendations for clinical practitioners in radiology departments, including radiographers. Radiography practice has to significantly adjust to these new requirements to support optimal and safe imaging practices for the diagnosis of Covid-19. The adoption of low dose CT, rigorous infection control protocols and optimal use of personal protective equipment may reduce the potential risks of radiation exposure and infection, respectively, within Radiology departments.","Stogiannos, N; Fotopoulos, D; Woznitza, N; Malamateniou, C",Radiography (Lond),190,1

This resulted in a lower sugar-based beverage tax, the Health Promotion Levy (HPL), of approximately 10% coming into effect in April 2018. We provide a synthesis of findings until April 2021. Studies show that despite the lower rate, purchases of unhealthy SSBs and sugar intake consumption from SSBs fell. There were greater reductions in SSB purchases among both lower socioeconomic groups and in subpopulations with higher SSB consumption. These subpopulations bear larger burdens from obesity and related diseases, suggesting that this policy improves health equity. The current COVID-19 pandemic has impacted food and nutritional security.

We aimed to assess its impact on mental health during the early phase by comparing pandemic with prepandemic data and to identify potential risk and protective factors. METHODS: For this systematic review and meta-analyses, we systematically searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science from January 1, 2019 to May 29, 2020, and screened reference lists of included studies. In addition, we searched PubMed and PsycINFO for prepandemic comparative data. Survey studies assessing mental burden by the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in the general population, healthcare workers, or any patients (eg, COVID-19 patients), with a broad range of eligible mental health outcomes, and matching studies evaluating prepandemic comparative data in the same population (if available) were included. We used multilevel meta-analyses for main, subgroup, and sensitivity analyses, focusing on (perceived) stress, symptoms of anxiety and depression, and sleep-related symptoms as primary outcomes. RESULTS: Of 2429 records retrieved, 104 were included in the review (n = 208,261 participants), 43 in the meta-analysis (n = 71,613 participants). While symptoms of anxiety (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.40; 95% CI 0.15-0.65) and depression (SMD 0.67; 95% CI 0.07-1.27) were increased in the general population during the early phase of the pandemic compared with prepandemic conditions, mental burden was not increased in patients as well as healthcare workers, irrespective of COVID-19 patient contact. Specific outcome measures (eg, Patient Health Questionnaire) and older comparative data (published &#8805;5 years ago) were associated with increased mental burden. Across the three population groups, existing mental disorders, female sex, and concerns about getting infected were repeatedly reported as risk factors, while older age, a good economic situation, and education were protective. CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis paints a more differentiated picture of the mental health consequences in pandemic situations than previous reviews. High-quality, representative surveys, high granular longitudinal studies, and more research on protective factors are required to better understand the psychological impacts of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and to help design effective preventive measures and interventions that are tailored to the needs of specific population groups.","Kunzler, Angela M; Röthke, Nikolaus; Günthner, Lukas; Stoffers-Winterling, Jutta; Tüscher, Oliver; Coenen, Michaela; Rehfuess, Eva; Schwarzer, Guido; Binder, Harald; Schmucker, Christine; Meerpohl, Joerg J; Lieb, Klaus",Global Health,190,16

However, the differences in the clinical presentation between children and adults were unclear. Thus, we aimed to investigate the differences in the clinical manifestations and imaging characteristics between Chinese children and adults with COVID-19 by systematically analyzing the data derived from some latest literatures. METHODS: An extensive search of COVID-19 papers was conducted in PubMed and Chinese medical journal network, and relevant articles were selected based on some standard requirements. The included papers were analyzed for differences in clinical manifestation between children and adults with COVID-19 after the quality evaluation with the QUADAS-2 tool. The differences in the clinical features and CT findings were analyzed using a Pearson &#967;2 test or Fisher's exact test. Patients who underwent CT examination were divided into the initial examination (0-4days) and follow-up examination groups (5-14 days). RESULTS: A total of 345patients (70 children and 275 adults) with RT- PCR (+) were included in our study (5 papers for children and 5 papers for adult groups). Significant differences between children and adults were found in exposure history (p < 0.001, &#967;2 = 166.890), fever (p = 0.016, &#967;2 = 5.757), white cell count (p < 0.001, &#967;2 = 14.043), and CT features in the initial (p < 0.001, &#967;2 = 60.653) and follow-up stages (p < 0.001, &#967;2 = 52.924); and the involved lung in the follow-up stage (p ï¼ 0.001, &#967;2 = 16.776).

However, the prevalence of ongoing care needs among those experiencing severe COVID-19 illness is unclear. AIM: This pilot study aimed to address this knowledge gap by examining GP attendance trends among patients attending a post-COVID-19 hospital follow-up clinic, 3-6 months after an initial clinic visit. DESIGN & SETTING: Data were collected from adult patients attending a post-COVID-19 follow-up clinic at the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital (MMUH), Dublin, Ireland. METHOD: Participants completed questionnaires outlining their demographics; medical histories; emergency hospital admissions and readmissions where applicable; and, where relevant, GP attendances following hospital discharge. Analyses were conducted using descriptive and inferential statistics. RESULTS: Participants' (n = 153) median age was 43.5 years (interquartile range [IQR] = 30.9-52.1 years). There were 105 females (68.6%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 61.3% to 75.9%). Various medical histories were reported among participants. Sixty-seven (43.2%, 95% CI = 35.9% to 51.6%) received emergency COVID-19 hospital care. Older adults, males, intensive care unit [ICU] admissions, and readmissions were common among hospital attendees. Of the hospital attendees, 16 (24%, 95% CI = 13.7% to 34.2%) attended GPs within 7 days of hospital discharge, and 26 (39%, 95% CI = 27.3% to 50.7%) within 30 days. Older adults, people with pre-existing medical conditions, and individuals admitted to ICU and/or readmitted to hospital were common among general practice attendees. CONCLUSION: Persistent health issues appear to be common among patients with severe COVID-19, particularly those who are older adults, have pre-existing health problems, and who had been in ICU and/or readmission care. Larger scale studies of ongoing COVID-19 care needs in primary care and general practice are required.","Broughan, John; McCombe, Geoff; Avramovic, Gordana; Crowley, Des; Downey, Cheyenne; O039, Downey; Sullivan, Joanne; Fawsitt, Ronan; McHugh, Tina; O039,; Connor, Eileen; Perrotta, Carla; Cotter, Aoife G; Lambert, John S; Cullen, Walter",,190,1

In order to effectively target government responses, it is critical to identify the individuals most at risk of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19), developing severe clinical signs, and mortality. We undertook a systematic review of the literature to present the current status of scientific knowledge in these areas and describe the need for unified global approaches, moving forwards, as well as lessons learnt for future pandemics. METHODS: Medline, Embase and Global Health were searched to the end of April 2020, as well as the Web of Science. Search terms were specific to the SARS-CoV-2 virus and COVID-19. Comparative studies of risk factors from any setting, population group and in any language were included. Titles, abstracts and full texts were screened by two reviewers and extracted in duplicate into a standardised form. Data were extracted on risk factors for COVID-19 disease, severe disease, or death and were narratively and descriptively synthesised. RESULTS: One thousand two hundred and thirty-eight papers were identified post-deduplication. Thirty-three met our inclusion criteria, of which 26 were from China. Six assessed the risk of contracting the disease, 20 the risk of having severe disease and ten the risk of dying. Age, gender and co-morbidities were commonly assessed as risk factors. The weight of evidence showed increasing age to be associated with severe disease and mortality, and general comorbidities with mortality. Only seven studies presented multivariable analyses and power was generally limited. A wide range of definitions were used for disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: The volume of literature generated in the short time since the appearance of SARS-CoV-2 has been considerable. Many studies have sought to document the risk factors for COVID-19 disease, disease severity and mortality; age was the only risk factor based on robust studies and with a consistent body of evidence. Mechanistic studies are required to understand why age is such an important risk factor. At the start of pandemics, large, standardised, studies that use multivariable analyses are urgently needed so that the populations most at risk can be rapidly protected.

To address this question, I study the association between the incidence of COVID-19 and the degree of spousal sorting into occupations that differ by contact intensity at the workplace. The mechanism, that I explore, implies that the higher degree of positive spousal sorting mitigates intra-household contagion and this translates into a smaller number of individuals exposed to COVID-19 risk. Using the U.S. data at the state level, I argue that spousal sorting is an important factor for understanding the disparities in the prevalence of COVID-19 during the early stages of the pandemic. First, I document that it creates about two-thirds of the U.S. dual-earner couples that are exposed to higher COVID-19 health risk due to within-household transmission. Moreover, I uncover substantial heterogeneity in the degree of spousal sorting by state. Next, for the first week of April 2020, I estimate that a one standard deviation increase in the measure of spousal sorting is associated with a 30% reduction in the total number of cases per 100000 inhabitants and a 39.3% decline in the total number of deaths per 100000 inhabitants. Furthermore, I find substantial temporal heterogeneity as the coefficients decline in magnitude over time. My results speak to the importance of policies that allow mitigating intra-household contagion.","Malkov, Egor",,190,1

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019 and has expanded into a global pandemic. This mass casualty triage, while requiring tremendous resources, also required early decision-making and ultimately allocation of critical care resources. Primary Objective was to ascertain risk factors of COVID-19 patients requiring ICU admission. Identify biomarkers, clinical risk factors, and comorbid conditions that can predict clinical outcome. METHODS. Setting and Study Design. We performed a natural history/retrospective chart review of patient admissions (n=5,568) at our facility for patients admitted between March 1-May 1, 2020, over 18 years of age, with a positive test less than 15 days before admission. We examined their inflammatory biomarker profile and clinical phenotype collected as part of their standard of care (n=90 variables). Analysis. Random forests used as a variable selector were assessed via a modified hamming distance between variable importance rankings of models with identical hyperparameters. The top 10% of variables (n=9) by mean decrease accuracy (MDA) were then included in a gradient-boosted tree model (xgboost package, R-Project) to build classifiers of ICU admissions and mortality. A random hyperparameter space search determined a final model that maximized 5-fold cross-validated AUCROC. All data was collected in compliance with the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 11 and approved by the NYU IRB#20-00473. RESULTS. The classifiers of ICU admission and mortality had AUCROC = 0.93 and 0.90, and classification error = 15.6% and 20.2% based on the Youden's index-optimal probability threshold, respectively. Variables in the final predictive models of ICU admission and mortality are shown by rank (by MDA) in each model, with rank of 1 being the most important, Figure 1. In predicting ICU admission, the three most important variables were triglycerides, procalcitonin, and c-reactive protein;age, initial O2 flow (L/min), and blood O2 saturation were the three most important predictors of mortality. Procalcitonin, blood O2 saturation, lactate, and initial O2 flow (L/min) were predicted both ICU admission and mortality. CONCLUSION. Our models will be included in an online calculator that will be made available and can be used at point of care by providers to assist risk assessment and triage. Our analysis suggests that novel biomarker combinations may be important in assessment of COVID-19 severity. Future work will include validation of these models in other populations.","Crowley, G.; Kwon, S.; Mengling, L.; Nolan, A.",American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine,190,24

METHODS: We used a prospective COVID-19 registry of all patients (symptomatic and asymptomatic) in Kuwait who tested positive from February 24th to April 20th, 2020, collected from Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah Hospital, the officially-designated COVID-19 healthcare facility in the country. We ran separate logistic regression models comparing non-Kuwaitis to Kuwaitis for death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pneumonia. RESULTS: The first 1123 COVID-19 positive patients in Kuwait were all recruited in the study. About 26% were Kuwaitis and 73% were non-Kuwaiti. With adjustments made to age, gender, smoking and selected co-morbidities, non-Kuwaitis had two-fold increase in the odds of death or being admitted to the intensive care unit compared to Kuwaitis (OR: 2.14, 95% CI 1.12-4.32). Non-Kuwaitis had also higher odds of ARDS (OR:2.44, 95% CI 1.23-5.09) and pneumonia (OR: 2.24, 95% CI 1.27-4.12). CONCLUSION: This is the first study to report on COVID-19 outcomes between Kuwaiti and non-Kuwaiti patients. The current pandemic may have amplified the differences of health outcomes among marginalized subpopulations. A number of socioeconomic and environmental factors could explain this health disparity. More research is needed to advance the understanding of policymakers in Kuwait in order to make urgent public health interventions.","Hamadah, Hala; Alahmad, Barrak; Behbehani, Mohammad; Al-Youha, Sarah; Almazeedi, Sulaiman; Al-Haddad, Mohannad; Jamal, Mohammad H; Al-Sabah, Salman",BMC Public Health,190,16

Several diagnostic strategies are available to identify current infection, rule out infection, identify people in need of care escalation, or to test for past infection and immune response. Serology tests to detect the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 aim to identify previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, and may help to confirm the presence of current infection. OBJECTIVES: To assess the diagnostic accuracy of antibody tests to determine if a person presenting in the community or in primary or secondary care has SARS-CoV-2 infection, or has previously had SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the accuracy of antibody tests for use in seroprevalence surveys. SEARCH METHODS: We undertook electronic searches in the Cochrane COVID-19 Study Register and the COVID-19 Living Evidence Database from the University of Bern, which is updated daily with published articles from PubMed and Embase and with preprints from medRxiv and bioRxiv. In addition, we checked repositories of COVID-19 publications. We did not apply any language restrictions. We conducted searches for this review iteration up to 27 April 2020. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included test accuracy studies of any design that evaluated antibody tests (including enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, chemiluminescence immunoassays, and lateral flow assays) in people suspected of current or previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, or where tests were used to screen for infection. We also included studies of people either known to have, or not to have SARS-CoV-2 infection. We included all reference standards to define the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2 (including reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests (RT-PCR) and clinical diagnostic criteria). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We assessed possible bias and applicability of the studies using the QUADAS-2 tool. We extracted 2x2 contingency table data and present sensitivity and specificity for each antibody (or combination of antibodies) using paired forest plots. We pooled data using random-effects logistic regression where appropriate, stratifying by time since post-symptom onset. We tabulated available data by test manufacturer. We have presented uncertainty in estimates of sensitivity and specificity using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). MAIN RESULTS: We included 57 publications reporting on a total of 54 study cohorts with 15,976 samples, of which 8526 were from cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Studies were conducted in Asia (n = 38), Europe (n = 15), and the USA and China (n = 1). We identified data from 25 commercial tests and numerous in-house assays, a small fraction of the 279 antibody assays listed by the Foundation for Innovative Diagnostics. More than half (n = 28) of the studies included were only available as preprints. We had concerns about risk of bias and applicability. Common issues were use of multi-group designs (n = 29), inclusion of only COVID-19 cases (n = 19), lack of blinding of the index test (n = 49) and reference standard (n = 29), differential verification (n = 22), and the lack of clarity about participant numbers, characteristics and study exclusions (n = 47). Most studies (n = 44) only included people hospitalised due to suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection. There were no studies exclusively in asymptomatic participants. Two-thirds of the studies (n = 33) defined COVID-19 cases based on RT-PCR results alone, ignoring the potential for false-negative RT-PCR results. We observed evidence of selective publication of study findings through omission of the identity of tests (n = 5). We observed substantial heterogeneity in sensitivities of IgA, IgM and IgG antibodies, or combinations thereof, for results aggregated across different time periods post-symptom onset (range 0% to 100% for all target antibodies). We thus based the main results of the review on the 38 studies that stratified results by time since symptom onset. The numbers of individuals contributing data within each study each week are small and are usually not based on tracking the same groups of patients over time. Pooled results for IgG, IgM, IgA, total antibodies and IgG/IgM all showed low sensitivity during the first week since onset of symptoms (all less than 30.1%), rising in the second week and reaching their highest values in the third week. The combination of IgG/IgM had a sensitivity of 30.1% (95% CI 21.4 to 40.7) for 1 to 7 days, 72.2% (95% CI 63.5 to 79.5) for 8 to 14 days, 91.4% (95% CI 87.0 to 94.4) for 15 to 21 days. Estimates of accuracy beyond three weeks are based on smaller sample sizes and fewer studies. For 21 to 35 days, pooled sensitivities for IgG/IgM were 96.0% (95% CI 90.6 to 98.3). There are insufficient studies to estimate sensitivity of tests beyond 35 days post-symptom onset. Summary specificities (provided in 35 studies) exceeded 98% for all target antibodies with confidence intervals no more than 2 percentage points wide. False-positive results were more common where COVID-19 had been suspected and ruled out, but numbers were small and the difference was within the range expected by chance. Assuming a prevalence of 50%, a value considered possible in healthcare workers who have suffered respiratory symptoms, we would anticipate that 43 (28 to 65) would be missed and 7 (3 to 14) would be falsely positive in 1000 people undergoing IgG/IgM testing at days 15 to 21 post-symptom onset. At a prevalence of 20%, a likely value in surveys in high-risk settings, 17 (11 to 26) would be missed per 1000 people tested and 10 (5 to 22) would be falsely positive. At a lower prevalence of 5%, a likely value in national surveys, 4 (3 to 7) would be missed per 1000 tested, and 12 (6 to 27) would be falsely positive. Analyses showed small differences in sensitivity between assay type, but methodological concerns and sparse data prevent comparisons between test brands. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The sensitivity of antibody tests is too low in the first week since symptom onset to have a primary role for the diagnosis of COVID-19, but they may still have a role complementing other testing in individuals presenting later, when RT-PCR tests are negative, or are not done. Antibody tests are likely to have a useful role for detecting previous SARS-CoV-2 infection if used 15 or more days after the onset of symptoms. However, the duration of antibody rises is currently unknown, and we found very little data beyond 35 days post-symptom onset. We are therefore uncertain about the utility of these tests for seroprevalence surveys for public health management purposes. Concerns about high risk of bias and applicability make it likely that the accuracy of tests when used in clinical care will be lower than reported in the included studies. Sensitivity has mainly been evaluated in hospitalised patients, so it is unclear whether the tests are able to detect lower antibody levels likely seen with milder and asymptomatic COVID-19 disease. The design, execution and reporting of studies of the accuracy of COVID-19 tests requires considerable improvement. Studies must report data on sensitivity disaggregated by time since onset of symptoms. COVID-19-positive cases who are RT-PCR-negative should be included as well as those confirmed RT-PCR, in accordance with the World Health Organization (WHO) and China National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (CDC) case definitions. We were only able to obtain data from a small proportion of available tests, and action is needed to ensure that all results of test evaluations are available in the public domain to prevent selective reporting. This is a fast-moving field and we plan ongoing updates of this living systematic review.","Deeks, Jonathan J; Dinnes, Jacqueline; Takwoingi, Yemisi; Davenport, Clare; Spijker, René; Taylor-Phillips, Sian; Adriano, Ada; Beese, Sophie; Dretzke, Janine; Ferrante di Ruffano, Lavinia; Harris, Isobel M; Price, Malcolm J; Dittrich, Sabine; Emperador, Devy; Hooft, Lotty; Leeflang, Mariska Mg; Van den Bruel, Ann",Cochrane Database Syst Rev,190,24

Vitamin D has been proposed as a modifiable risk factor that could mitigate COVID-19 health disparities. We investigated the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity using the UK Biobank, a large progressive cohort study of the United Kingdom population. Structural equation modelling was used to evaluate the ability of vitamin D, socioeconomic deprivation, and other known risk factors to mediate COVID-19 ethnic health disparities. Asian ethnicity is associated with higher COVID-19 susceptibility, compared to the majority White population, and Asian and Black ethnicity are both associated with higher COVID-19 severity. Socioeconomic deprivation mediates all three ethnic disparities and shows the highest overall signal of mediation for any COVID-19 risk factor. Vitamin supplements, including vitamin D, mediate the Asian disparity in COVID-19 susceptibility, and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcifediol) levels mediate Asian and Black COVID-19 severity disparities. Several measures of overall health also mediate COVID-19 ethnic disparities, underscoring the importance of comorbidities. Our results support ethnic minorities use of vitamin D as both a prophylactic and a supplemental therapeutic for COVID-19.","Marino-Ramirez, Leonardo; Ahmad, Maria; Rishishwar, Lavanya; Nagar, Shashwat Deepali; Lee, Kara K.; Norris, Emily T.; Jordan, I.

Therefore, it is important to identify the most effective tax support instruments for the innovation activities of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are used in the framework of anti-crisis economic policies in the OECD countries. It is suggested that tax incentives are the most effective tax instrument of all;the effectiveness of the profit tax benefit depends on the SME's profitability;as to the social insurance and pension contribution, there is an allowable minimum of the rate, determined by the level of wages, that will stimulate innovation. To assess the effectiveness of tax support tools, the study used the methods of linear multivariate regression and simulation in Simulink. The source of information for regression analysis was the data published by the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). It was concluded that the most effective measures of tax support are tax incentives, as well as deferred payment of social insurance and pension contributions. The 10% profit tax was shown to be optimal to stimulate innovation provided the company keeps the saved profit for development. For innovative SMEs, the minimum allowable contribution rate for social insurance and pension provision, which stimulates their innovative activities, is 12%. The results of modeling confirmed that the proposed threshold indicators for supporting SMEs' innovation activity can be an effective tool for overcoming the consequences of the global crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.","Shapovalova, A.

It has now been clearly demonstrated that SARS-CoV­2 resides in the upper airways and transmits easily via aerosols and droplets, which significantly increases the risk of infection when performing upper airway procedures. Ventilated COVID-19 patients in a critical condition in the intensive care unit may require tracheotomy for long-term ventilation and to improve weaning. However, the risk of secondary infection of medical personnel performing subsequent tracheostomy care remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the risk of droplet dispersion during tracheostomy tube change and overview tracheostomy tube change in COVID-19 patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current literature was reviewed, quantitative and qualitative analyses of droplet formation during tracheostomy tube change in nâ¯= 8 patients were performed, and an overview of and checklist for tracheostomy tube change were compiled. RESULTS: This study demonstrates that tracheostomy tube change, in particular insertion of the new tube, may cause significant droplet formation. The aerosolization of particles smaller than 5â¯µm was not analyzed. CONCLUSION: Our data, together with the current literature, clearly emphasize that tracheostomy care is associated with a high infection risk and should only be performed by a small group of well-trained, maximally protected healthcare personnel.","Kempfle, J S; Löwenheim, H; Huebner, M J; Iro, H; Mueller, S K",HNO,190,1

[99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept may be of benefit in OSCC with complex lymphatic drainage patterns and close spatial relation to SLNs. METHODS: A prospective within-patient evaluation study was designed to compare [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept with [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid for SLN detection. A total of 20 patients with early-stage OSCC were included, who underwent lymphoscintigraphy with both tracers. Both lymphoscintigraphic images of each patient were evaluated for SLN detection and radiotracer distribution at 2-4 h post-injection. RESULTS: The injection site's remaining radioactivity was significantly lower for [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept (29.9%), compared with [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid (60.9%; p < 0.001). Radioactive uptake in SLNs was significantly lower for [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept (1.95%) compared with [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid (3.16%; p = 0.010). No significant difference was seen in SLN to injection site ratio in radioactivity between [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept (0.066) and [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid (0.054; p = 0.232). A median of 3.0 and 2.5 SLNs were identified with [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept and [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid, respectively (p = 0.297). Radioactive uptake in higher echelon nodes was not significantly different between [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept (0.57%) and [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid (0.86%) (p = 0.052). A median of 2.0 and 2.5 higher echelon nodes was identified with [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept and [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid, respectively (p = 0.083). CONCLUSION: [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept had a higher injection site clearance, but at the same time a lower uptake in the SLN, resulting in an SLN to injection site ratio, which was not significantly different from [99mTc]Tc-nanocolloid. The relatively low-radioactive uptake in SLNs of [99mTc]Tc-tilmanocept may limit intraoperative detection of SLNs, but can be overcome by a higher injection dose.","den Toom, Inne J; Mahieu, Rutger; van Rooij, Rob; van Es, Robert J J; Hobbelink, Monique G G; Krijger, Gerard C; Tijink, Bernard M; de Keizer, Bart; de Bree, Remco",Eur. j. nucl. med. mol. imaging,190,1

Surging growth and competition among preprint servers, coupled with a massive volume of COVID-19-related preprints, mainly on bioRxiv and medRxiv, as well as select indexing now being tested on PubMed, suggests that preprints are being increasingly used in the biomedical sciences. Stronger and more robust ethical policies are needed to screen preprints before they are released to the public, and even if this implies a slight delay in publication, it may increase academics' trust in this form of scientific information and communication. Clear and stringent ethical policies need to be urgently introduced by ethics groups such as COPE and the ICMJE, whose many member journals allow preprints to be posted before traditional peer review. Stringent ethical guidelines that treat misconduct equally in preprints and peer-reviewed papers will boost the integrity of academic publishing.","Teixeira da Silva, Jaime A.",Journal of Taibah University Medical Sciences,190,1

Investigating the adaptive immune response against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, in patients who have recovered from this disease could contribute to our understanding of the natural host immune response. We enrolled 38 participants in this study. 7 healthy participants and 31 COVID-19 patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and categorized them into 3 groups according to their previous clinical presentations: 10 moderate, 9 mild, and 12 asymptomatic. Flow cytometry analysis of peripheral lymphocyte counts in recovered patients showed significantly increased levels of CD4+ T cells in patients with a history of mild and moderate COVID-19 symptoms compared with those healthy individuals (p < 0.05 and p < 0.0001 respectively). whereas no significant difference was observed in the CD8+ T cell percentage in COVID-19-recovered patients compared with healthy individuals. Our study demonstrated that antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (anti-S) IgG antibody production could be observed in all recovered COVID-19 patients, regardless of whether they were asymptomatic (p < 0.05)or presented with mild (p < 0.0001) or moderate symptoms (p < 0.01) . Anti-S IgG antibodies could be detected in participants up to 90 days post-infection. In conclusion, the lymphocyte levels in recovered patients were associated with the clinical presentation of the disease, and further analysis is required to investigate relationships between different clinical presentations and lymphocyte activation and function.","Alsayb, May A; Dakhilallah D Alsamiri, Ali; Makhdoom, Hatem Q; Alwasaidi, Turki; Mohammed Osman, Haitham; Mahallawi, Waleed H",,190,31

Home-based OPAT allows for safe completion of prolonged courses of therapy while decreasing costs to the healthcare system, minimizing the risk of hospital-related infectious exposures for patients, and permitting patients to recover in a familiar environment. Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, during which nursing facilities have been at the center of many outbreaks of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, completion of antimicrobial therapy in the home is an even more appealing option. Persons who inject drugs (PWID) frequently present with infectious complications of their injection drug use which require long courses of parenteral therapy. However, these individuals are frequently excluded from home-based OPAT on the basis of their addiction history. This commentary describes perceived challenges to establishing home-based OPAT for PWID, discusses ways in which this is discriminatory and unsupported by available data, highlights ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic has accentuated inequities in care, and proposes a multidisciplinary approach championed by Addiction specialists to increasing implementation of OPAT for appropriate patients with substance use disorders.","Jawa, Raagini; Rozansky, Hallie; Clemens, Dylan; Fagan, Maura; Walley, Alexander Y",Journal of addiction medicine (Online),190,16

Health promotion foregrounds the pertinence of social, economic, cultural, political and spiritual life in creating and maintaining health. This necessitates a critical structural determinants of health perspective that actively engages with the experiences of health and wellbeing among diverse peoples. The inequitable impacts of pandemics are well documented, as are calls for improved pandemic responses. Yet, current pandemic and emergency preparedness plans do not adequately account for the social and structural determinants of health and health equity. METHODS: Through five one-hour online conversations held in April 2020, we engaged 13 practice, policy, research and community leaders on the intersections of COVID-19 and gender, racism, homelessness, Indigenous health and knowledge, household food insecurity, disability, ethics and equitable futures post-COVID-19. We conducted a thematic analysis of speaker and participant contributions to investigate the impacts and influence of COVID-19 related to the structural and social determinants of health. We analyzed which policies, practices and responses amplified or undermined equity and social justice and identified opportunities for improved action. FINDINGS: Analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic revealed four broad themes:â¢ oppressive, unjust systems and existing health and social inequities;â¢ health and social systems under duress and non-responsive to equity;â¢ disproportionate impacts of COVID-19 driven by underlying structural and socioeconomic inequity; andâ¢ enhanced momentum for collective mobilization, policy innovations and social transformation. DISCUSSION: There was a strong desire for a more just and equitable society in a post-COVID-19 world, going 'back to better' rather than 'back to normal.' Our analysis demonstrates that equity has not been well integrated into pandemic planning and responses. Social movement and systems theories provide insight on ways to build on existing community mobilization and policy openings for sustained social transformation.","Ndumbe-Eyoh, Sume; Muzumdar, Pemma; Betker, Claire; Oickle, Diane",Glob Health Promot,190,16

Not only affecting the lungs and provoking acute respiratory distress, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is able to infect multiple cell types including cardiac and vascular cells. Hence a significant proportion of infected patients develop cardiac events such as arrhythmias and heart failure. Patients with cardiovascular comorbidities are at highest risk of cardiac death. To face the pandemic and limit its burden, health authorities have launched several fast track calls for research projects aiming to develop rapid strategies to combat the disease, as well as longer-term projects to prepare for the future. Biomarkers have the possibility to aid in clinical decision making and tailoring healthcare in order to improve patient quality of life. The biomarker potential of circulating RNAs has been recognized in several disease conditions, including cardiovascular disease. RNA biomarkers may be useful in the current COVID-19 situation. The discovery, validation and marketing of novel biomarkers, including RNA biomarkers, require multi-centre studies by large and interdisciplinary collaborative networks, involving both the academia and the industry. Here, members of the EU-CardioRNA COST Action CA17129 summarize the current knowledge about the strain that COVID-19 places on the cardiovascular system and discuss how RNA biomarkers can aid to limit this burden.

Due to the lack of consistency in data reporting during the initial spread of COVID-19, the Equitable Data Collection and Disclosure on COVID-19 Act was introduced into the Congress that mandates collection and reporting of demographic COVID-19 data on testing, treatments, and deaths by age, sex, race and ethnicity, primary language, socioeconomic status, disability, and county. To our knowledge, no studies have evaluated how COVID-19 demographic data have been collected before and after the introduction of this legislation. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate differences in reporting and public availability of COVID-19 demographic data by US state health departments and Washington, District of Columbia (DC) before (pre-Act), immediately after (post-Act), and 6 months after (6-month follow-up) the introduction of the Equitable Data Collection and Disclosure on COVID-19 Act in the Congress on April 21, 2020. METHODS: We reviewed health department websites of all 50 US states and Washington, DC (N=51). We evaluated how each state reported age, sex, and race and ethnicity data for all confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths and how they made this data available (ie, charts and tables only or combined with dashboards and machine-actionable downloadable formats) at the three timepoints. RESULTS: We found statistically significant increases in the number of health departments reporting age-specific data for COVID-19 cases (P=.045) and resulting deaths (P=.002), sex-specific data for COVID-19 deaths (P=.003), and race- and ethnicity-specific data for confirmed cases (P=.003) and deaths (P=.005) post-Act and at the 6-month follow-up (P<.05 for all). The largest increases were race and ethnicity state data for confirmed cases (pre-Act: 18/51, 35%; post-Act: 31/51, 61%; 6-month follow-up: 46/51, 90%) and deaths due to COVID-19 (pre-Act: 13/51, 25%; post-Act: 25/51, 49%; and 6-month follow-up: 39/51, 76%). Although more health departments reported race and ethnicity data based on federal requirements (P<.001), over half (29/51, 56.9%) still did not report all racial and ethnic groups as per the Office of Management and Budget guidelines (pre-Act: 5/51, 10%; post-Act: 21/51, 41%; and 6-month follow-up: 27/51, 53%). The number of health departments that made COVID-19 data available for download significantly increased from 7 to 23 (P<.001) from our initial data collection (April 2020) to the 6-month follow-up, (October 2020). CONCLUSIONS: Although the increased demand for disaggregation has improved public reporting of demographics across health departments, an urgent need persists for the introduced legislation to be passed by the Congress for the US states to consistently collect and make characteristics of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations available in order to allocate resources to mitigate disease spread.","Ossom-Williamson, Peace; Williams, Isaac Maximilian; Kim, Kukhyoung; Kindratt, Tiffany B",JMIR Public Health Surveill,190,14

Objective: To evaluate the performance of the Colombian public health surveillance system during the first 50 days of the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. Materials and methods: We analyzed the data published between March 6 and April 24, 2020, by the Instituto Nacional de Salud and the World Health Organization (WHO). We evaluated: i) the quality of the data according to the fulfillment of Benford's law, and ii) the timeliness of the information measured as the difference in dates between the data generated by the Instituto Nacional de Salud and WHO's situational reports. We assessed the fulfillment of Benford's law using the p values of the log-likelihood ratio, the chi square or Moreno's exact tests. Results: Until April 24 there were 4,881 cases of COVID-19 in Colombia. During most of the first 50 days of the pandemic, Benford's law was fulfilled except the first days of the epidemic. The difference between Instituto Nacional de Salud and WHO reports largely depends on the different reporting times. Conclusion: In general, the Colombian public health surveillance system fulfilled Benford's law suggesting that there was quality in the data. Future studies comparing the performance of the departments and districts will improve the diagnosis of the Colombian surveillance system.","Manrique-Hernández, Edgar F; Moreno-Montoya, José; Hurtado-Ortiz, Alexandra; Prieto-Alvarado, Franklyn E; Idrovo, Álvaro J",Biomedica,190,13

Its excessive concentrations in the aqueous environments may result in severe and irreversible damage. To fight this hazard, a raw biochar was prepared from Citrullus lanatus L. seeds, then characterized and compared with a MnFe2O4 modified biochar, both tested for U(VI) adsorption from wastewater, which was assayed for the first time in this study. The characterization of the adsorbent materials was performed by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) with elemental mapping, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The effects of solution pH, concentration of sorbate and sorbents, temperature, time and ionic strength were assessed as regards their influence on U(VI) adsorption. The experimental adsorption data showed good fit to a pseudo-second-order kinetic model (reaching a value of qe = 15.12 mg g-1, R2 = 0.96 at equilibrium), and to the Langmuir isotherm (achieving a maximum score of qmax = 27.61 mg g-1, R2 = 0.96). The maximum adsorption capacity was found at 318 K. The results of the study indicate that the binding of negatively charged functional groups (carbonyls, hydroxyls, and some carboxylic groups) with MnFe2O4 significantly enhanced U(VI) adsorption. In view of the overall results, it can be concluded that the MnFe2O4 modification of the Citrullus lanatus L. seeds biochar could give an efficient alternative adsorbent for U(VI) removal in a variety of environmental conditions, simultaneously promoting resource utilization and good sustainable management of the materials studied, aiding to protect the environment and human health.","Ahmed, Waqas; Mehmood, Sajid; Núñez-Delgado, Avelino; Ali, Sehrish; Qaswar, Muhammad; Khan, Zulqarnain Haider; Ying, Huang; Chen, Di-Yun",Sci Total Environ,190,1

This paper reflects upon the proposition of public libraries as health literate multi-purpose workspaces for improving health literacy. We draw upon our combined experiences as evaluators of organizational health literacy initiatives, and library sector development, engagement and advocacy. Key ideas were presented as part of the 2020 State Library Victoria seminar series on 'Libraries: The Heart of a Healthy Community'. Key messages included: Public libraries are well positioned to contribute to the health literacy movement, as they provide the general public with: universal free access to information and services; extensive in-house and outreach educational collaborative learning opportunities; and health and wellbeing support by being welcoming, safe, and trusted community spaces. To date, limited discussion exists about conceptualizing public libraries as health literate multi-purpose workspaces for supporting and sustaining public library health literacy efforts. A health literate organizational framework is suggested to support libraries simply supporting health information literacy to being recognised as health literate organizations. Five workspace principles (empowerment, equitable, inclusive, collaborative and integrated) are suggested to provide directions for public libraries as health literate multi-purpose workspaces for improving the health literacy of individuals, communities, organizations and indeed systems. To inform the design, implementation and evaluation of public libraries as workspaces for improving health literacy, key principles-focused evaluation questions are suggested for consideration. SO WHAT?: Public Libraries as welcoming, safe, and trusted community organizations are well placed to be health literate multipurpose workspaces for improving health literacy.","Naccarella, Lucio; Horwood, Jacqui",Health promotion journal of Australia :official journal of Australian Association of Health Promotion Professionals,190,1

Materials and Methods: Pure tone audiometry (PTA) was performed at 0.25-12 kHz on 35 RT and 25 CRT patients after 12-month followed up. The hearing loss was evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) criteria. Results: SNHL increased to 84% in patients who had received CRT, compared with 26% increasing in patients who had treated with RT. There was an increased risk of SNHL at all frequencies for ears received a cochlear mean dose >50 Gy in RT group, compared to those receiving cochlear mean dose >30 Gy in CRT group. SNHL was more severe at higher frequencies in both patient groups. Conclusion: Characteristic of radiation-induced SNHL is different from CRT-induced SNHL, especially in threshold radiation dose and PTA frequency.","Mahdavi, Seied Rabi; Rezaeyan, Abolhasan; Nikoofar, Alireza; Bakhshandeh, Mohsen; Farahani, Saeid; Cheraghi, Susan",J Cancer Res Ther,190,33

Although pediatric COVID-19 patients have been relatively spared compared with adults, recent reports showed an increasing number of critically ill patients with multisystemic inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-c), with marked cardiovascular impairment. Nevertheless, little is known about the relationship between cardiac abnormalities and inflammatory and coagulation biomarkers. OBJECTIVES: to investigate echocardiographic abnormalities in pediatric patients with COVID-19 admitted to tertiary hospital. METHODS: this was a retrospective longitudinal study, based on the review of medical records and echocardiograms of patients (0-19 years) admitted to a tertiary hospital between March 30 and June 30, 2020. For statistical analysis, the significance level was set at 5% (p &lt; 0.05). RESULTS: Forty-eight patients were enrolled, 73% with preexisting diseases, 20 (41.7%) with MIS-c. Median age was 7.5 (0-18.6) years;27 (56.2%) were male. Median duration of hospitalization was 15.4 (2-92) days and seven (14.6%) patients died. A total of 70 echocardiograms were performed;66.7% patients were scanned only once and 33.3% multiple times. Twenty-three (48%) patients showed echocardiographic abnormalities: eight (16.6%) left ventricle (LV) systolic dysfunction, six (12.5%) right ventricle (RV) systolic dysfunction and 12 (25%) coronary dilatation (Z-score&gt;+2.5). Echocardiographic abnormalities were significantly associated with MIS-c, admission to the pediatric intensive care unit, multiple organ dysfunction, ventilatory/vasoactive support, and death (p&lt;0.05). Significantly higher d-dimer (ng/mL) levels were detected in patients with LV dysfunction [16733(4157-115668) vs. 2406.5(190-95040)], RV dysfunction [25769(3422-115668) vs. 2803.5(190-95040)] and coronary artery dilation [9652.5(921-115668) vs. 2724(190- 95040)] (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Echocardiographic abnormalities in COVID-19 pediatric patients were frequent and associated with worse clinical outcomes. Exacerbation of the inflammation and coagulation pathways may play an important role in cardiovascular injury in those patients.","Diniz, M. F. R.; Cardoso, M. F.; Sawamura, K. S. S.; Menezes, C. R.

In this context, the implementation of AI observatory endeavors represents one key research direction. This paper motivates the need for an inherently transdisciplinary AI observatory approach integrating diverse retrospective and counterfactual views. We delineate aims and limitations while providing hands-on-advice utilizing concrete practical examples. Distinguishing between unintentionally and intentionally triggered AI risks with diverse socio-psycho-technological impacts, we exemplify a retrospective descriptive analysis followed by a retrospective counterfactual risk analysis. Building on these AI observatory tools, we present near-term transdisciplinary guidelines for AI safety. As further contribution, we discuss differentiated and tailored long-term directions through the lens of two disparate modern AI safety paradigms. For simplicity, we refer to these two different paradigms with the terms artificial stupidity (AS) and eternal creativity (EC) respectively. While both AS and EC acknowledge the need for a hybrid cognitive-affective approach to AI safety and overlap with regard to many short-term considerations, they differ fundamentally in the nature of multiple envisaged long-term solution patterns. By compiling relevant underlying contradistinctions, we aim to provide future-oriented incentives for constructive dialectics in practical and theoretical AI safety research.","Aliman, Nadisha-Marie; Kester, Leon; Yampolskiy, Roman",,190,10

Methods: We propose a novel, integrative, and neural network-based literature-based discovery (LBD) approach to identify drug candidates from both PubMed and COVID-19-focused research literature. Our approach relies on semantic triples extracted using SemRep (via SemMedDB). We identified an informative subset of semantic triples using filtering rules and an accuracy classifier developed on a BERT variant, and used this subset to construct a knowledge graph. Five SOTA, neural knowledge graph completion algorithms were used to predict drug repurposing candidates. The models were trained and assessed using a time slicing approach and the predicted drugs were compared with a list of drugs reported in the literature and evaluated in clinical trials. These models were complemented by a discovery pattern-based approach. Results: Accuracy classifier based on PubMedBERT achieved the best performance (F1= 0.854) in classifying semantic predications. Among five knowledge graph completion models, TransE outperformed others (MR = 0.923, Hits@1=0.417). Some known drugs linked to COVID-19 in the literature were identified, as well as some candidate drugs that have not yet been studied. Discovery patterns enabled generation of plausible hypotheses regarding the relationships between the candidate drugs and COVID-19. Among them, five highly ranked and novel drugs (paclitaxel, SB 203580, alpha 2-antiplasmin, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and butylated hydroxytoluene) with their mechanistic explanations were further discussed. Conclusion: We show that an LBD approach can be feasible for discovering drug candidates for COVID-19, and for generating mechanistic explanations. Our approach can be generalized to other diseases as well as to other clinical questions.","Zhang, Rui; Hristovski, Dimitar; Schutte, Dalton; Kastrin, Andrej; Fiszman, Marcelo; Kilicoglu, Halil",,190,1

In this registry study, we aimed to identify differences in cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) between COVID-19 and all-cause myocarditis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined CMRI of patients with COVID-19 and elevated high-sensitivity serum troponin levels performed between March 31st and May 5th and compared them to CMRI of patients without SARS-CoV-2 infection with suspected myocarditis in the same time period. For this purpose, we evaluated Lake-Louise Criteria for myocarditis by determining nonischemic myocardial injury via T1-mapping, extracellular volume, late gadolinium enhancement, and myocardial edema (ME) by T2-mapping and fat-saturated T2w imaging (T2Q). RESULTS: A total of 15 of 18 (89%) patients with COVID-19 had abnormal findings. The control group consisted of 18 individuals. There were significantly fewer individuals with COVID-19 who had increased T2 (5 vs. 10; P=0.038) and all-cause ME (7 vs. 15; P=0.015); thus, significantly fewer patients with COVID-19 fulfilled Lake-Louise Criteria (6 vs. 17; P<0.001). In contrast, nonischemic myocardial injury was not significantly different. In the COVID-19 group, indexed end-diastolic volume of the left ventricle showed a significant correlation to the extent of abnormal T1 (R2=0.571; P=0.017) and extracellular volume (R2=0.605; P=0.013) and absolute T1, T2, and T2Q (R2=0.644; P=0.005, R2=0.513; P=0.035 and R2=0.629; P=0.038, respectively); in the control group, only extracellular volume showed a weak correlation (R2=0.490; P=0.046). CONCLUSIONS: Cardiac involvement in COVID-19 seems to show less ME than all-cause myocarditis. Abnormal CMRI markers correlated to left ventricle dilation only in the COVID-19 group. Larger comparative studies are needed to verify our findings.","Maurus, Stephan; Weckbach, Ludwig T; Marschner, Constantin; Kunz, Wolfgang G; Ricke, Jens; Kazmierczak, Philip M; Bieber, Stephanie; Brado, Johannes; Kraechan, Angelina; Hellmuth, Johannes C; Hausleiter, Joerg; Massberg, Steffen; Grabmaier, Ulrich; Curta, Adrian",J. thorac imaging,190,16

Gathered clinicopathological evidence in COVID-19 patients shows that alveoli injuries and interstitial changes are the major mechanisms of impaired O2/CO2 exchange. Few rehabilitation exercises concerning COVID-19 patients were reported. Here, we present a modified version of rehabilitation exercises based on the underlying mechanism of the disease to mild cases of COVID-19. These exercises aimed to improve the pulmonary function of patients and ease the expectoration process. Additionally, an essential branch of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) named acupressure was integrated into the exercises to facilitate the recovery and maintenance of pulmonary function. METHODS: From March 4, 2020 to May 5, 2020, a total of 60 COVID-19 patients who completed the full course of MRE were enrolled in this observational study. The diagnostic and classification criteria were based on the 7th edition of Diagnosis and Treatment Guideline of COVID-19 published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China. We prospectively gathered patients' reported outcomes concerning respiration-related symptoms at four different time points, including: (I) at admission; (II) at the time of hospital discharge; (III) two weeks after discharge; (IV) four weeks after discharge. The reported respiratory symptoms included dry cough, productive cough, difficulty in expectoration, and dyspnea. RESULTS: In total, 60 confirmed mild COVID-19 cases were enrolled with a median age of 54 years old. The baseline prevalence for dry cough, productive cough, difficulty in expectoration, and dyspnea were 41.7%, 43.3%, 35.0%, and 50.0%, respectively. The pronounced decline in symptom prevalence was recorded over time. Interestingly, four weeks after discharge, we noticed a lower remission rate in productive cough and difficulty in expectoration. CONCLUSIONS: The modified rehabilitation exercises were retrieved from the Eight-Section Brocade, and are specifically designed for rehabilitation of COVID-19 patients at home or health facilities. Based on current findings on pronouncedly improved remission rate in respiratory symptoms, we recommend the MRE as suitable rehabilitation exercise to smooth respiration and ease the expectoration process in mild COVID-19 cases.","Zha, Lulu; Xu, Xi; Wang, Dongya; Qiao, Guibin; Zhuang, Weitao; Huang, Shujie",Ann Palliat Med,190,24

The procedure of modeling consists of two essential components: the first component is to solve the mathematical model numerically, the so-called forward modeling. The second component is to identify the unknown parameter values in the model, which is known as inverse modeling and leads to identifying the epidemiological model more precisely. The main goal of this paper is to develop the forward and inverse modeling of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic using novel computational methodologies in order to accurately estimate and predict the pandemic. This leads to governmental decisions support in implementing effective protective measures and prevention of new outbreaks. To this end, we use the logistic equation and the SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) system of ordinary differential equations to model the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the inverse modeling, we propose Bayesian inversion techniques, which are robust and reliable approaches, in order to estimate the unknown parameters of the epidemiological models. We deploy an adaptive Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for the estimation of a posteriori probability distribution and confidence intervals for the unknown model parameters as well as for the reproduction number. We perform our analyses on the publicly available data for Austria to estimate the main epidemiological model parameters and to study the effectiveness of the protective measures by the Austrian government. The estimated parameters and the analysis of fatalities provide useful information for decision-makers and makes it possible to perform more realistic forecasts of future outbreaks. According to our Bayesian analysis for the logistic model, the growth rate and the carrying capacity are estimated respectively as 0.28 and 14974. Moreover for the parameters of the SIR model, namely the transmission rate and recovery rate, we estimate 0.36 and 0.06, respectively. Additionally, we obtained an average infectious period of 17 days and a transmission period of 3 days for COVID-19 in Austria. We also estimate the reproduction number over time for Austria. This quantity is estimated around 3 on March 26, when the first recovery was reported. Then it decays to 1 at the beginning of April. Furthermore, we present a fatality analysis for COVID-19 in Austria, which is also of importance for governmental protective decision-making. According to our analysis, the case fatality rate (CFR) is estimated as 4% and a prediction of the number of fatalities for the coming 10 days is also presented. Additionally, the ICU bed usage in Austria indicates that around 2% of the active infected individuals are critical cases and require ICU beds. Therefore, if Austrian governmental protective measures would not have taken place and for instance if the number of active infected cases would have been around five times larger, the ICU bed capacity could have been exceeded.","Taghizadeh, Leila; Karimi, Ahmad; Heitzinger, Clemens",Comput Biol Med,190,24

When viruses invade the glomeruli from the bloodstream, glomerular endothelial cells (GECs) initiate the innate immune reactions. We investigated the expression of interferon (IFN)-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) 1/2/3, antiviral molecules, in human GECs treated with a toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 agonist. Role of IFIT1/2/3 in the expression of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) was also examined. METHODS: Human GECs were cultured and stimulated with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly IC), a synthetic TLR3 agonist. Real-time qPCR, Western blotting, and ELISA were used to examine the expression of IFIT1/2/3, IFN-ß, and CXCL10. RNA interference against IFN-ß or IFIT1/2/3 was also performed. RESULTS: Expression of IFIT1/2/3 and CXCL10 was induced by poly IC in GECs. The inductions were inhibited by RNA interfering of IFN-ß. Knockdown of IFIT1/2/3 decreased the CXCL10 expression. Knockdown of IFIT3 decreased the expression of IFIT1 and IFIT2 proteins. CONCLUSION: IFIT1/2/3 and CXCL10 were induced by poly IC via IFN-ß in GECs. IFIT1/2/3 may increase the expression of CXCL10 which induces lymphocyte chemotaxis and may inhibit the replication of infected viruses. These molecules may play a role in GEC innate immune reactions in response to viruses.","Imaizumi, Tadaatsu; Hashimoto, Shun; Sato, Riko; Umetsu, Hidenori; Aizawa, Tomomi; Watanabe, Shojiro; Kawaguchi, Shogo; Matsumiya, Tomoh; Seya, Kazuhiko; Ding, Jiangli; Tanaka, Hiroshi",Kidney Blood Press Res,190,16

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease, caused by the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, has had a huge impact on our society, including in relation to the continuous supply of personal protective equipment (PPE). The aim of the study is to give a detailed overview of 3D-printed PPE devices and provide practical information regarding the manufacturing and further design process, as well as describing the potential risks of using them. Open-source models of a half-face mask, safety goggles, and a face-protecting shield are evaluated, considering production time, material usage, and cost. Estimations have been performed with fused filament fabrication (FFF) and selective laser sintering (SLS) technology, highlighting the material characteristics of polylactic acid (PLA), polyamide, and a two-compound silicone. Spectrophotometry measurements of transparent PMMA samples were performed to determine their functionality as goggles or face mask parts. All the tests were carried out before and after the tetra-acetyl-ethylene-diamine (TAED)-based disinfection process. The results show that the disinfection has no significant effect on the mechanical and structural stability of the used polymers; therefore, 3D-printed PPE is reusable. For each device, recommendations and possible means of development are explained. The files of the modified models are provided. SLS and FFF additive manufacturing technology can be useful tools in PPE development and small-series production, but open-source models must be used with special care.","Rendeki, Szilard; Nagy, Balint; Bene, Matyas; Pentek, Attila; Toth, Luca; Szanto, Zalan; Told, Roland; Maroti, Peter",,190,21

METHODS: A retrospective data collection and evaluation was conducted to include all the patients hospitalized for TB at INMI from 9 March to 31 August 2020 (lockdown period and three months thereafter). For the purpose of the study, data from patients hospitalized in the same period of 2019 were also collected. RESULTS: In the period of March-August 2019, 201 patients were hospitalized with a diagnosis of TB, while in the same period of 2020, only 115 patients, with a case reduction of 43%. Patients with weight loss, acute respiratory failure, concurrent extrapulmonary TB, and higher Timika radiographic scores were significantly more frequently hospitalized during 2020 vs. 2019. The median patient delay was 75 days (IQR: 40-100) in 2020 compared to 30 days (IQR: 10-60) in 2019 (p < 0.01). Diagnostic delays in 2020 remain significant in the multiple logistic model (AOR = 6.93, 95%CI: 3.9-12.3). CONCLUSIONS: Our experience suggests that COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on TB patient care in terms of higher diagnostic delay, reduction in hospitalization, and a greater severity of clinical presentations.","Di Gennaro, Francesco; Gualano, Gina; Timelli, Laura; Vittozzi, Pietro; Di Bari, Virginia; Libertone, Raffaella; Cerva, Carlotta; Pinnarelli, Luigi; Nisii, Carla; Ianniello, Stefania; Mosti, Silvia; Bevilacqua, Nazario; Iacomi, Fabio; Mondi, Annalisa; Topino, Simone; Goletti, Delia; Vaia, Francesco; Ippolito, Giuseppe; Girardi, Enrico; Palmieri, Fabrizio",,190,4

Pure Machine Learning (ML) approaches often fail in the small sample regime and cannot provide actionable insights beyond predictions. A promising modification has been to incorporate expert domain knowledge into ML models. The application we consider is predicting the progression of disease under medications, where a plethora of domain knowledge is available from pharmacology. Pharmacological models describe the dynamics of carefully-chosen medically meaningful variables in terms of systems of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). However, these models only describe a limited collection of variables, and these variables are often not observable in clinical environments. To close this gap, we propose the latent hybridisation model (LHM) that integrates a system of expert-designed ODEs with machine-learned Neural ODEs to fully describe the dynamics of the system and to link the expert and latent variables to observable quantities. We evaluated LHM on synthetic data as well as real-world intensive care data of COVID-19 patients. LHM consistently outperforms previous works, especially when few training samples are available such as at the beginning of the pandemic.","Qian, Zhaozhi; Zame, William R.; Fleuren, Lucas M.; Elbers, Paul; Schaar, Mihaela van der",,190,16

Favipiravir, indicated for the treatment of new and re-emerging influenza infections, has been suggested to be effective against SARS-CoV-2, although this is not yet fully validated. We administered favipiravir to a 64-year-old female patient with COVID-19. Her symptoms resolved quickly after the start of treatment, with reduction of SARS-CoV-2 viral load, but she developed a fever again on day 12. Since the fever was relieved by discontinuation of favipiravir, and based on positive results with a drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation test, we diagnosed her with favipiravir-induced drug fever. A decrease in the serum concentration of favipiravir was observed along with resolution of the fever. The present case suggests that drug fever should be considered in the differential diagnosis of relapsing fever episodes in COVID-19 patients receiving favipiravir.","Murai, Yushi; Kawasuji, Hitoshi; Takegoshi, Yusuke; Kaneda, Makito; Kimoto, Kou; Ueno, Akitoshi; Miyajima, Yuki; Kawago, Koyomi; Fukui, Yasutaka; Ogami, Chika; Sakamaki, Ippei; Tsuji, Yasuhiro; Morinaga, Yoshitomo; Yamamoto, Yoshihiro",Int J Infect Dis,190,20

Methods: Anti-PD-L1 antibodies underwent sulfohydryl moiety-specific conjugation with maleimide-deferoxamine (DFO) followed by 89Zr radiolabeling. 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG was evaluated for radiochemical purity, specific activity and radiolabel stability. Parental CT26 colon cancer cells and CT26/PD-L1 cells engineered to stably overexpress PD-L1 underwent binding assays, flow cytometry, and Western blotting. In vivo pharmacokinetics was evaluated and tumor-bearing mice underwent biodistribution and PET studies after 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG injection. Results: 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG synthesis was straightforward and efficient. SDS PAGE showed that reduction with TCEP produced half-antibody fragments and MALDI-TOF analysis estimated 2.18 DFOs conjugated per antibody, indicting site-specific conjugation at the hinge region disulfide bonds. High expressing CT26/PD-L1 cells showed 102.2 ± 6.7-fold greater 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG binding compared to weak expressing CT26 cells. Excellent target specificity was confirmed by a drastic reduction of CT26/PD-L1 cell binding to 3.0 ± 0.8% by excess cold antibody. Intravenous 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG followed bi-exponential blood clearance. Tissue activity assessed by PET/CT demonstrated decreases in major organ activity over 7 days, whereas high CT26/PD-L1 tumor activity was maintained. Again, this was suppressed by excess cold antibody. Treatment of CT26 cells with gemcitabine for 24 h augmented PD-L1 protein to 592.4 ± 114.2% of controls and increased 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG binding. This was accompanied by increased AKT activation and reduced PTEN. In CT26 tumor mice, gemcitabine treatment substantially increased tumor uptake from 1.56 ± 0.48 to 6.24 ± 0.37 %ID/g (tumor/blood ratio: 34.7). Immunoblots revealed significant increases in tumor PD-L1 and activated AKT and a decrease of PTEN. Conclusion: 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG showed specific targeting with favorable pharmacokinetic and PET imaging properties. Gemcitabine treatment upregulated cancer cell and tumor PD-L1 expression and increased 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG uptake. 89Zr-PD-L1 IgG PET may thus be useful for monitoring chemotherapy-mediated tumor PD-L1 modulation in living subjects.","Jung, Kyung-Ho; Park, Jin Won; Lee, Jin Hee; Lee, Eun Ji; Moon, Seung Hwan; Cho, Young Seok; Lee, Kyung-Han",J. nucl. med,190,16

As part of an effort to reduce the consequences of this outbreak on health service delivery to stroke patients, the European Stroke Organisation has undertaken a survey aimed at collecting information on the provision of stroke care during the pandemic. Methods: Cross-sectional, web-based survey, conducted from 26 March through 1 April 2020 among stroke care providers, focused on reorganisation of health services, the delivery of acute and post-acute stroke care and the availability of personal protective equipment. Results: A total of 426 stroke care providers from 55 countries completed the survey, most of whom worked in Europe (n = 375, 88%) and were stroke physicians/neurologists (n = 334, 78%). Among European respondents, 289 (77%) reported that not all stroke patients were receiving the usual care in their centres and 266 (71%) estimated that functional outcomes and recurrence rates of stroke patients would be negatively affected by the organisational changes caused by the pandemic. The areas considered as being most affected were acute care and rehabilitation. Most professionals had to adapt their activities and schedules and more than half reported shortage of protective equipment. Discussion: Strategies to maintain availability of stroke care during the COVID-19 outbreak are crucial to prevent indirect mortality and disability due to suboptimal care. Conclusion: European Stroke Organisation proposes a set of targeted actions for decision makers facing this exceptional situation.","Aguiar de Sousa, Diana; van der Worp, H Bart; Caso, Valeria; Cordonnier, Charlotte; Strbian, Daniel; Ntaios, George; Schellinger, Peter D; Sandset, Else Charlotte",Eur.

Specifically, energy-based devices and lasers require special consideration, as they may emit plume which has been shown to contain tissue debris and aerosolized biological materials. Prior studies have shown transmission of viruses and bacteria via plume (i.e., HIV and papillomavirus). The purpose of this study was to evaluate plume characteristics of the Er:YAG resurfacing laser (Sciton; Palo Alto, CA) and compare it to the Morpheus8 fractional radiofrequency device (InMode; Lake Forest, CA). METHODS: Five patients who underwent aesthetic resurfacing and/or skin tightening of the face and neck were treated with the Er:YAG (Sciton Joule, Palo Alto, CA) and/or fractional radiofrequency (Morpheus8, Lake Forest, CA) between April 1 and May 11, 2020. Data collected included patient demographics, past medical history, treatment parameters, adverse events, particle counter data, as well as high magnification video equiptment. Patients were evaluated during treatment with a calibrated particle meter (PCE; Jupiter, FL). The particle meter was used at a consistent focal distance (6-12 inches) to sample the surrounding environment during treatment at 2.83 L/min to a counting efficiency of 50% at 0.3 µm and 100% at >0.45 µm. Recordings were obtained with and without a smoke evacuator. RESULTS: Of our cohort (n = 5), average age was 58 years old (STD ±7.2). Average Fitzpatrick type was between 2 and 3. Two patients received Er:YAG fractional resurfacing in addition to fractional radiofrequency during the same treatment session. Two patients had fractional radiofrequency only, and one patient had laser treatment with the Er:YAG only. There were no adverse events recorded. The particle counter demonstrated ambient baseline particles/second (pps) at 8 (STD ±6). During fractional radiofrequency treatment at 1-mm depth, the mean recording was 8 pps (STD ±8). At the more superficial depth of 0.5 mm, recordings showed 10 pps (STD ±6). The Er:YAG laser resurfacing laser had mean readings of 44 pps (STD ±11). When the particle sizes were broken down by size, the fractional radiofrequency device had overall smaller particle sizes with a count of 251 for 0.3 µm (STD ±147) compared with Er:YAG laser with a count of 112 for 0.3 µm (STD ±84). The fractional radiofrequency did not appear to emit particles >5 µm throughout the treatment, however, the Er:YAG laser consistently recorded majority of particles in the range of 5-10 µm. The addition of the smoke evacuator demonstrated a 50% reduction in both particles per second recorded as well as all particle sizes. CONCLUSION: Re-evaluation of the plume effect from aesthetic devices has become important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further studies are required to characterize viability of COVID-19 viability and transmissibility in plume specimens. Based on this pilot study, we recommend that devices that generate little to no plume such as fractional radiofrequency devices be used in Phase I reopening of practice while devices that generate a visible plume such as Er:YAG laser resurfacing devices be avoided and only used with appropriate personal protective equipment in addition to a smoke evacuator in Phase IV reopening.","Dayan, Erez; Theodorou, Spero; Katz, Bruce; Dover, Jeffrey S",Lasers surg. med,190,1

On the other hand, a quantitative evaluation of 12 provincial policies grounded on a revised framework and policy modeling consistency index approach was conducted. The results show that Chinese governments adopt a bottom-up incrementalism planning mode for the policy steering of the construction of new infrastructure.

Comorbidities, in particular, diabetes and hypertension, clearly associated with age, besides obesity and smoke, are strongly associated with the need for intensive treatment and a dismal outcome. A weaker immunity of the elderly has been proposed as a possible explanation of this uneven age distribution. Thus, there is concern that children treated for cancer may allso be at risk for an unfavourable course of infection. Along the same line, anecdotal information from Wuhan, China, mentioned a severe course of COVID-19 in a child treated for leukaemia. AIM AND METHODS: We made a flash survey on COVID-19 incidence and severity among children on anticancer treatment. Respondents were asked by email to fill in a short Web-based survey. RESULTS: We received reports from 25 countries, where approximately 10,000 patients at risk are followed up. At the time of the survey, more than 200 of these children were tested, nine of whom were positive for COVID-19. Eight of the nine cases had asymptomatic to mild disease, and one was just diagnosed with COVID-19. We also discuss preventive measures that are in place or should be taken and treatment options in immunocompromised children with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: Thus, even children receiving anticancer chemotherapy may have a mild or asymptomatic course of COVID-19. While we should not underestimate the risk of developing a more severe course of COVID-19 than that observed here, the intensity of preventive measures should not cause delays or obstructions in oncological treatment.","Hrusak, Ondrej; Kalina, Tomas; Wolf, Joshua; Balduzzi, Adriana; Provenzi, Massimo; Rizzari, Carmelo; Rives, Susana; Del Pozo Carlavilla, María; Alonso, Maria E V; Domínguez-Pinilla, Nerea; Bourquin, Jean-Pierre; Schmiegelow, Kjeld; Attarbaschi, Andishe; Grillner, Pernilla; Mellgren, Karin; van der Werff Ten Bosch, Jutte; Pieters, Rob; Brozou, Triantafyllia; Borkhardt, Arndt; Escherich, Gabriele; Lauten, Melchior; Stanulla, Martin; Smith, Owen; Yeoh, Allen E J; Elitzur, Sarah; Vora, Ajay; Li, Chi-Kong; Ariffin, Hany; Kolenova, Alexandra; Dallapozza, Luciano; Farah, Roula; Lazic, Jelena; Manabe, Atsushi; Styczynski, Jan; Kovacs, Gabor; Ottoffy, Gabor; Felice, Maria S; Buldini, Barbara; Conter, Valentino; Stary, Jan; Schrappe, Martin",Eur J Cancer,190,1

The indicator provides the share of students that can potentially be reached by remote learning policies given the availability of necessary household assets such as radios, televisions, computers and internet access. The results of this analysis outline the stark inequities in access to remote learning, suggesting that at a minimum, more than 30 % of schoolchildren globally cannot be reached by remote learning policies due to the high variation in access to assets for remote learning that exists within and between the world regions. The analysis finds that wealth and area of residence are key factors affecting the reachability of remote learning policies, suggesting that children who reside in rural areas and/or belong to the poorest households in their country are at the greatest risk of being left behind.","Avanesian, Garen Mizunoya Suguru Amaro Diogo",International Journal of Educational Development,190,18

The infection rapidly spread to more than 200 countries around the world. The clinical presentation of the disease may vary from mild illness to severe pneumonia such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The chest computed tomography (CT) has an important complementary role in diagnosis of the disease. The predominant CT findings of the disease are ground glass opacities and consolidations located in subpleural areas of lower lobes. Widespread ground-glass opacities, consolidation, air bronchograms, central involvement of lung parenchyma, mediastinal lymphadenopathy are more common in patients with the severe form of the disease. CT imaging also guides in differentiation of alternative diagnosis or in assessment of associated pulmonary embolism during the course of the disease. In this pictorial review we aim to review the CT features of COVID-19 pneumonia and mention the changes throughout the disease process.","Bayraktaroglu, Selen; Çinkooglu, Akin; Ceylan, Naim; Savas, Recep",Diagn. interv. radiol,190,2

Immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridisation techniques that facilitate reliable and reproducible detection of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 viral products in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) specimens would be of great utility. A selection of commercial antibodies generated against SARS-CoV spike protein and nucleoprotein, double stranded RNA, and RNA probe for spike genes were evaluated for the ability to detect FFPE infected cells. We also tested both heat- and enzymatic-mediated virus antigen retrieval methods to determine the optimal virus antigen recovery as well as identifying alternative retrieval methods to enable flexibility of IHC methods. In addition to using native virus infected cells as positive control material, the evaluation of non-infected cells expressing coronavirus (SARS, MERS) spike as a biosecure alternative to assays involving live virus was undertaken. Optimized protocols were successfully applied to experimental animal-derived tissues.

RESULTS: The increase of activity during the lockdown (+32% of treated patients, +156% of new patients and +28% of delivered preparations) concerned solid tumour, mainly breast cancer, even if haematological malignancies remained the most frequent.

BACKGROUND: Both FFR and percent FFR increase measured after PCI showed incremental prognostic implications. However, there is no current method to predict post-PCI physiological results using physiological assessment in the pre-PCI phase. METHODS: An automated algorithm that analyzes instantaneous FFR gradient per unit time (dFFR(t)/dt) was developed from the derivation cohort (n = 30). Using dFFR(t)/dt, the pattern of atherosclerotic disease in each patient was classified into 3 groups (major, mixed, and minor FFR gradient groups) in both the internal validation cohort with constant pullback method (n = 234) and the external validation cohort with nonstandardized pullback methods (n = 252). All patients in the validation cohorts underwent PCI on the basis of pre-PCI FFR &#8804;0.80. Suboptimal post-PCI physiological results were defined as both post-PCI FFR <0.84 and percent FFR increase &#8804;15%. From the derivation cohort, cutoffs of dFFR(t)/dt for major and minor FFR gradient were 0.035/s and 0.015/s, respectively. RESULTS: In validation cohorts, dFFR(t)/dt showed significant correlations with percent FFR increase (R = 0.801; p < 0.001) and post-PCI FFR (R = 0.099; p = 0.029). In both the internal and external validation cohorts, the major FFR gradient group showed significantly higher post-PCI FFR and percent FFR increase compared with those in the mixed or minor FFR gradient groups (all p values <0.001). The proportions of suboptimal post-PCI physiological results were significantly different among 3 groups (10.4% vs. 25.8% vs. 45.7% for the major, mixed, and minor FFR gradient groups, respectively; p < 0.001) in validation cohorts. Absence of major FFR gradient lesion (odds ratio: 2.435, 95% [CI]: 1.252 to 4.734; p = 0.009) and presence of minor FFR gradient lesion (odds ratio: 2.756, 95% confidence interval: 1.629 to 4.664; p < 0.001) were independent predictors for suboptimal post-PCI physiological results. CONCLUSIONS: The automated algorithm analyzing pre-PCI pullback curve was able to predict post-PCI physiological results. The incidence of suboptimal post-PCI physiological results was significantly different according to algorithm-based classifications in the pre-PCI physiological assessment.

Methods Surfaces of objects were routinely wiped with 1000 mg/L chlorine containing disinfectant . Air and sewage disinfection was proceeded routinely and strictly. Hospital environmental surfaces and PPE of staffs in isolation wards were sampled using swabs. The sewage from various inlet and outlets were sampled. The respiratory and stool specimens of patients were collected. The respiratory specimens of staffs in the isolation wards were also sampled once a week. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) methods were used to confirm the existence of SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Viral culture was done for the samples positive for SARS-Cov-2 RNA. Results During the study period, 33 laboratory-confirmed patients were hospitalized in isolation wards in the hospital. None of SARS-Cov-2 RNA was detected among the 36 objects surface samples and 9 staffs PPE samples in isolation wards. Though the 3 sewage samples from the inlet of preprocessing disinfection pool were positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and the sample from the outlet of preprocessing disinfection pool was weakly positive, the sewage sample from the outlet of the last disinfection pool was negative. All of the 5 sewage samples from various points were negative by viral culture of SARS-Cov-2. None of the respiratory specimens of staffs in the isolation wards were positive. Conclusions Though SARS-Cov-2 RNA of the sewage samples were positive from inlets of the sewage disinfection pool and negative from the outlet of the last sewage disinfection pool, no viable virus was detected by culture. The monitoring data in this study suggested that the strict disinfection and hand hygiene could decrease the hospital-associated COVID-19 infection risk of the staffs in isolation wards.","Wang, Jie Feng HaiTing Zhang Sheng Ni ZuoWei Ni LingMei Chen Yu Zhuo LiXin Zhong ZiFeng Qu TingTing",International Journal of Infectious Diseases,190,10

Methods: We tracked the number of CCP units dispensed to hospitals by blood banking organizations and correlated that usage with hospital admission and mortality data. Results: CCP usage per admission peaked in Fall 2020, with more than 40% of inpatients estimated to have received CCP between late September and early November 2020. However, after randomized controlled trials failed to show a reduction in mortality, CCP usage per admission declined steadily to a nadir of less than 10% in March 2021. We found a strong inverse correlation (r = -0.52, p=0.002) between CCP usage per hospital admission and deaths occurring 2 weeks after admission, and this finding was robust to examination of deaths taking place 1, 2, or 3 weeks after admission. Changes in the number of hospital admissions, SARS-CoV-2 variants, and age of patients could not explain these findings. The retreat from CCP usage might have resulted in as many as 29,000 excess deaths from mid-November 2020 to February 2021. Conclusions: A strong inverse correlation between CCP use and mortality per admission in the USA provides population-level evidence consistent with the notion that CCP reduces mortality in COVID-19 and suggests that the recent decline in usage could have resulted in excess deaths.

METHODS: Using de-identified EHR data from the Geisinger-Regeneron DiscovEHR partnership, we compared patients with confirmed RT-PCR positive tests for the four common coronaviruses (229E, HKU1, NL63, OC43) or influenza (A and B) performed from June 2016 to February 2019. RESULTS: Overall, 52,833 patients were tested for coronaviruses and influenza viruses. For patients >=21 years old, 1,555 and 3,991 patient encounters had confirmed positive coronavirus and influenza tests, respectively. Both groups had similar ICU admission rates (7.2% vs. 6.1%, p=0.12), though patients with coronavirus had significantly more pneumonia (15% vs. 7.4%, p<0.001) and a higher death rate within 30 days of testing (4.9% vs. 3.0%, p<0.001). After controlling for other covariates, coronavirus infection still had a higher risk of death and pneumonia than influenza (OR 1.64 and 2.05, p<0.001), with no significant difference in ICU admission rates. CONCLUSIONS: Common coronaviruses cause significant morbidity, with potentially worse outcomes than influenza. These findings may help identify a subset of patients who are more susceptible to poor outcomes from common coronavirus infections and may help plan clinical interventions in patients with suspected infections.","Li, Dadong; Wolk, Donna M; Cantor, Michael N",J. infect. dis,190,17

The severe form of the disease is often associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and most critically ill patients require mechanical ventilation and support in intensive care units. A significant portion of COVID-19 patients also develop complications of the cardiovascular system, primarily acute myocardial injury, arrhythmia, or heart failure. To date, no specific antiviral therapy is available for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Exosomes derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are being explored for the management of a number of diseases that currently have limited or no therapeutic options, thanks to their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and pro-angiogenic properties. Here, we briefly introduce the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and its implications in the heart and lungs. Next, we describe some of the most significant clinical evidence of the successful use of MSC-derived exosomes in animal models of lung and heart injuries, which might strengthen our hypothesis in terms of their utility for also treating critically ill COVID-19 patients.","Gardin, Chiara; Ferroni, Letizia; Chachques, Juan Carlos; Zavan, Barbara",,190,1

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the virus that causes COVID-19. The World Health Organization has declared a global pandemic of this contagious disease. Researchers across the world are collaborating in a quest for remedies to combat this deadly virus. It has recently been demonstrated that the spike glycoprotein (SGP) of SARS-CoV-2 is the mediator by which the virus enters host cells. MAIN METHODS: Our group comprehensibly analyzed the SGP of SARS-CoV-2 through multiple sequence analysis and a phylogenetic analysis. We predicted the strongest immunogenic epitopes of the SGP for both B cells and T cells. KEY FINDINGS: We focused on predicting peptides that would bind major histocompatibility complex class I. Two optimal epitopes were identified, WTAGAAAYY and GAAAYYVGY. They interact with the HLA-B*15:01 allele, which was further validated by molecular docking simulation. This study also found that the selected epitopes are able to be recognized in a large percentage of the world's population. Furthermore, we predicted CD4+ T-cell epitopes and B-cell epitopes. SIGNIFICANCE: Our study provides a strong basis for designing vaccine candidates against SARS-CoV-2. However, laboratory work is required to validate our theoretical results, which would lay the foundation for the appropriate vaccine manufacturing and testing processes.","Rakib, Ahmed; Sami, Saad Ahmed; Mimi, Nusrat Jahan; Chowdhury, Md Mustafiz; Eva, Taslima Akter; Nainu, Firzan; Paul, Arkajyoti; Shahriar, Asif; Tareq, Abu Montakim; Emon, Nazim Uddin; Chakraborty, Sajal; Shil, Sagar; Mily, Sabrina Jahan; Ben Hadda, Taibi; Almalki, Faisal A; Emran, Talha Bin",Comput Biol Med,190,15

To enforce these measures, restrictions on outdoor behaviour have been implemented, limiting access to parks and recreational outdoor spaces. New evidence shows that COVID-19 restrictions are associated with an overall lower amount of time spent in outdoor play among Canadian children and youth. This is concerning, as outdoor play is important for children's physical and mental health and helps provide them with a sense of control during times of uncertainty and stress. As policies on access to the outdoors during the COVID-19 outbreak vary by province, it is possible that policy differences have led to regional differences in changes in outdoor play among children and youth. In this commentary, we examine regional differences in outdoor play among children and youth across Canada, and the association between provincial policies related to COVID-19 and outdoor play. We argue that through the recovery process, in the event of a second wave of infections, and in preparing for future public health challenges, policy decisions should consider ways to preserve outdoor play for Canadian children and youth.","de Lannoy, Louise; Rhodes, Ryan E; Moore, Sarah A; Faulkner, Guy; Tremblay, Mark S",Can J Public Health,190,1

METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study from 37 geographically diverse US children's hospitals. We included ED encounters between January 1, 2010 and December 31, 2020, transformed into time-series data. We constructed ensemble forecasting models of the most common presenting diagnoses and the most common diagnoses leading to admission, using data from 2010 through 2019. We then compared the most common presenting diagnoses and the most common diagnoses leading to admission in 2020 to the forecasts. RESULTS: 29,787,815 encounters were included, of which 1,913,085 (6.4%) occurred during 2020. ED encounters during 2020 were lower compared to prior years, with a 65.1% decrease in April relative to 2010-2019. In forecasting models, encounters for depression and diabetic ketoacidosis remained within the 95% confidence interval [CI]; fever, bronchiolitis, hyperbilirubinemia, skin/subcutaneous infections and seizures occurred within the 80-95% CI during the portions of 2020, and all other diagnoses (abdominal pain, otitis media, asthma, pneumonia, trauma, upper respiratory tract infections, and urinary tract infections) occurred below the predicted 95% CI. CONCLUSION: Pediatric ED utilization has remained low following the COVID-19 pandemic, and below forecasted utilization for most diagnoses. Nearly all conditions demonstrated substantial declines below forecasted rates from the prior decade and which persisted through the end of the year. Some declines in non-communicable diseases may represent unmet healthcare needs among children. Further study is warranted to understand the impact of policies aimed at curbing pandemic disease on children.","Ramgopal, Sriram; Pelletier, Jonathan H; Rakkar, Jaskaran; Horvat, Christopher M",Am J Emerg Med,190,1

Methods: The study is a retrospective, institutional cohort, interventional study. It was carried out at our Regional Institute of Ophthalmology from September 2020 to mid-March 2021. All patients of biopsy-proven mucormycosis were enrolled in the study. The patients were subjected to complete history taking, ophthalmological examination, and imaging studies. The patients were treated via a multidisciplinary approach with intravenous liposomal amphotericin B and debridement of local necrotic tissue. Exenteration was done when indicated. A minimum 75-day follow-up period was accorded to all study patients. Statistical analysis was done using Chi-square test. A P value &#8804;0.05 was taken as significant. Results: Thirty-one patients were seen, with a mean age of 56.3 years. The major risk factors included uncontrolled diabetes (96.7%) and COVID-19 positivity (61.2%), with concomitant steroid use in 61.2% patients. The most common presentation was diminution of vision (<6/60 in 80.64% patients) and ophthalmoplegia (77.4%).

As of March 31, 2020, a total of 82,631 cases of COVID-19 in China were confirmed by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China. METHODS: Three approaches, namely Poisson likelihood-based method (ML), exponential growth rate-based method (EGR) and stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed dynamic model-based method (SIR), were implemented to estimate the basic and controlled reproduction numbers. RESULTS: A total of 198 chains of transmission together with dates of symptoms onset and 139 dates of infections were identified among 14,829 confirmed cases outside Hubei Province as reported as of March 31, 2020. Based on this information, we found that the serial interval had an average of 4.60 days with a standard deviation of 5.55 days, the incubation period had an average of 8.00 days with a standard deviation of 4.75 days and the infectious period had an average of 13.96 days with a standard deviation of 5.20 days. The estimated controlled reproduction numbers, Rc, produced by all three methods in all analyzed regions of China are significantly smaller compared with the basic reproduction numbers R0. CONCLUSIONS: The controlled reproduction number in China is much lower than one in all regions of China by now. It fell below one within 30 days from the implementations of unprecedent containment measures, which indicates that the strong measures taken by China government was effective to contain the epidemic.

METHODS: This study integrates county-level data on confirmed COVID-19 cases from the Johns Hopkins Center for Systems Science and Engineering database with multiple disability variables from the 2018 American Community Survey. Statistical analyses are based on bivariate correlations and multivariate generalized estimating equations that consider spatial clustering in the data. RESULTS: Greater COVID-19 incidence rate is significantly associated with: (1) higher percentages of PwDs who are Black, Asian, Hispanic, Native American, below poverty, under 18 years of age, and female; and (2) lower percentages of PwDs who are non-Hispanic White, above poverty, aged 65 or more years, and male, after controlling for spatial clustering. CONCLUSIONS: Socio-demographically disadvantaged PwDs are significantly overrepresented in counties with higher COVID-19 incidence compared to other PwDs.

439135,439135,439135,The COVID-19 pandemic: Pathologists support the clinical infectious diseases team,15.008926,10.819693,2020,"We assessed the relation between COVID-19 waves in Italy, which was severely affected during the pandemic. We evaluated the hypothesis that a larger impact from the first wave (February-May 2020) predicts a smaller peak during the second wave (September-October 2020), in the absence of local changes in public health interventions and area-specific differences in time trends of environmental parameters. Based on publicly available data on province-specific SARS-CoV-2 infections and both crude and multivariable cubic spline regression models, we found that for provinces with the lowest incidence rates in the first wave, the incidence in the second wave increased roughly in proportion with the incidence in the first wave until an incidence of about 500-600 cases/100,000 in the first wave. Above that value, provinces with higher incidences in the first wave experienced lower incidences in the second wave. It appears that a comparatively high cumulative incidence of infection, even if far below theoretical thresholds required for herd immunity, may provide noticeable protection during the second wave. We speculate that, if real, the mechanism for this pattern could be depletion of most susceptible individuals and of superspreaders in the first wave. A population learning effect regarding cautious behavior could have also contributed. Since no area-specific variation of the national policy against the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was allowed until early November 2020, neither individual behaviors nor established or purported environmental risk factors of COVID-19, such as air pollution and meteorological factors, are likely to have confounded the inverse trends we observed in infection incidence over time.","Vinceti, Marco; Filippini, Tommaso; Rothman, Kenneth J; Di Federico, Silvia; Orsini, Nicola",Environ Res,190,16

Readmissions following hospitalization for diabetes are common, particularly in minority patients, who experience greater rates of complications and lower quality healthcare compared to white patients. This study examines disparities in diabetes-related readmissions in the Military Health System, a universally insured, population of 9.5 million beneficiaries, who may receive care from military (direct care) or civilian (purchased care) facilities. METHODS: The study identified a population of 7,605 adult diabetic patients admitted to the hospital in 2014. Diagnostic codes were used to identify hospital readmissions, and logistic regression was used to analyze associations among race, beneficiary status, patient or sponsor's rank, and readmissions at 30, 60, and 90 days. RESULTS: A total of 239 direct care patients and 545 purchased care patients were included in our analyses. After adjusting for age and sex, we found no significant difference in readmission rates for black versus white patients; however, we found a statistically significant increase in the likelihood for readmission of Native American/Alaskan Native patients compared to white patients, which persisted in direct care at 60 days (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 11.51, 95% CI 1.11-119.41) and 90 days (AOR 18.42, 95% CI 1.78-190.73), and in purchased care at 90 days (AOR 4.54, 95% CI 1.31-15.74). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that universal access to healthcare alleviates disparities for black patients, while Native America/Alaskan Native populations may still be at risk of disparities associated with readmissions among diabetic patients in both the closed direct care system and the civilian fee for service purchased care system.","Frankel, Dianne; Banaag, Amanda; Madsen, Cathaleen; Koehlmoos, Tracey",Mil. med,190,24

Following the success of the T Cell Project (TCP), which allowed the analysis of more than 1,500 cases of peripheral T-Cell lymphomas (PTCLs) collected prospectively in 18 Countries, in 2018 the TCP 2.0 was launched. Here we report the global distribution of PTCLs, from the cases registered so far based on the locally established histological diagnosis. Methods: The TCP2.0 (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03964480) is a prospective, international, observational study which adapts to changes made in the new WHO classification. Results: Since the beginning of the study (October 2018), 648 patients with newly diagnosed PTCL were registered by 75 active centers across 14 countries. Of these data, 594 patients have been validated by the centralized trial office. Overall, PTCL-NOS, Anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) ALK-negative, and Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), represent the most frequent subtypes, representing 31.3%, 18,9% and 13,5% of cases, respectively. As reported in Table 1, PTCL-NOS represents the most frequent subtype worldwide, whereas Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma was more frequent in Brazil, AITL and ALCL ALK-negative in Australia/ India, and ALCL ALK-positive in North America and Europe. Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type was relatively frequent in Brazil and quite rare in the other Latin America Countries. Finally, many sub-types represent less than 5% of cases in all geographic areas.

Protein disulfide isomerase A3 (PDIA3), an endoplasmic reticulum-based redox chaperone required for the functions of various fibrosis-related proteins; however, the mechanisms of action of PDIA3 in pulmonary fibrosis are not fully elucidated. OBJECTIVES: To examine the role of club cells and PDIA3 in the pathology of pulmonary fibrosis and the therapeutic potential of inhibition of PDIA3 in lung fibrosis. METHODS: Role of PDIA3 and aberrant club cells in lung fibrosis was studied by analyses of human transcriptome dataset from Lung Genomics Research Consortium, other public resources, the specific deletion or inhibition of PDIA3 in club cells and blocking SPP1 downstream of PDIA3 in mice. RESULTS: PDIA3 and club cell secretory protein (SCGB1A1) signatures are upregulated in IPF compared with control patients. PDIA3 or SCGB1A1 increases also correlate with a decrease in lung function in patients with IPF. The bleomycin (BLM) model of lung fibrosis showed increases in PDIA3 in SCGB1A1 cells in the lung parenchyma. Ablation of Pdia3, specifically in SCGB1A1 cells, decreases parenchymal SCGB1A1 cells along with fibrosis in mice. The administration of a PDI inhibitor LOC14 reversed the BLM-induced parenchymal SCGB1A1 cells and fibrosis in mice. Evaluation of PDIA3 partners revealed that SPP1 is a major interactor in fibrosis. Blocking SPP1 attenuated the development of lung fibrosis in mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals a new relationship with distally localised club cells, PDIA3 and SPP1 in lung fibrosis and inhibition of PDIA3 or SPP1 attenuates lung fibrosis.","Kumar, Amit; Elko, Evan; Bruno, Sierra R; Mark, Zoe F; Chamberlain, Nicolas; Mihavics, Bethany Korwin; Chandrasekaran, Ravishankar; Walzer, Joseph; Ruban, Mona; Gold, Clarissa; Lam, Ying Wai; Ghandikota, Sudhir; Jegga, Anil G; Gomez, Jose L; Janssen-Heininger, Yvonne Mw; Anathy, Vikas",Thorax,190,2

Here, we consider how COVID-induced job search anxiety-feeling anxious about one's job search due to issues imposed by the pandemic-has the potential to affect adaptive, goal-directed efforts, and maladaptive, goal-avoidant reactions. We theorize that this anxiety can prompt job seekers to engage in problem-solving pondering and affect-focused rumination, with these experiences relating to whether job seekers engage in various forms of search-related efforts the following week. In particular, we consider whether job seekers are engaging in dream job search effort (i.e., effort toward pursuing one's dream job), as well as focused (i.e., effort toward a selection of carefully screened jobs), exploratory (i.e., effort toward a wide swath of jobs in a broad manner), and haphazard (i.e., effort toward applying for any job without a clear plan) job search effort. Further, we consider how stable beliefs relevant to the pandemic (i.e., belief in conspiracy theories; belief in COVID-19 being a public health crisis) affect the aforementioned relationships. Using a weekly study of 162 new labor market entrants, results indicated that COVID-induced job search anxiety positively related to problem-solving pondering and affect-focused rumination; problem-solving pondering promoted dream, focused, and exploratory job search effort the following week, whereas affect-focused rumination hindered dream job search effort. Finally, the detrimental effects of COVID-induced job search anxiety via affect-focused rumination were amplified for those who held higher levels of conspiracy theory beliefs.

SC of the breast was initially described in children and adolescents, but a relatively frequent number of cases have been reported in adults. SC of the breast is often associated with a very good prognosis, but in adults with larger tumours it may carry a more aggressive behaviour. The present case refers to a 62-year-old female with a progressively growing large breast tumour, during 16 years. Physical examination demonstrated extensive fixation of the tumour to skin with prominent inflammatory signs and areas of cutaneous necrosis. Initial treatment was a palliative mastectomy. Due to the histological diagnosis of secretory carcinoma, without skin invasion, the patient was then submitted to axillary dissection that disclosed metastasis in 2 out of 13 lymph nodes. The patient died 24 months after surgery without further treatment, due to dissemination of the disease. The present case corroborates the ominous prognosis of the secretory carcinoma in adults with large tumours (T2) and with lymph nodes metastasis (N1).

Potential interactions between renin-angiotensin system (RAS), immune markers and COVID-19 play a role in disease outcome in specific groups of patients. OBJECTIVE: This review aimed to describe the particularities of the RAS and the immune system profile of particular subgroups of patients. METHODS: This non-systematic review summarizes evidence on SARS-CoV-2 infection in specific subgroups of patients and possible relationships between immune system, RAS and the pathophysiology of COVID-19. RESULTS: The RAS and the immune system exert a role in the pathogenesis and prognosis of COVID-19, mainly in cases of hypertension, diabetes, obesity and other chronic diseases. The overactivation of the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis and the enhancement of inflammation contribute to deleterious effects of COVID-19. Likewise, pregnant women and elderly patients usually display immune responses that are less effective in withstanding exposition to viruses, while children are relatively protected against severe complications of COVID-19. Women, conversely, exhibit stronger antiviral responses and are less sensitive to the effects of increased Ang II. Future Perspectives: The recognition of vulnerable subgroups and risk factors for disease severity are essential to better understand the pandemic. Precision medicine tools, including proteomics and metabolomics approaches, identified metabolic patterns of the severe form of disease and might be the alternative to diagnose, evaluate and predict the prognosis and the efficiency of therapies.","de Barcelos Ubaldo Martins, Ludimila; Jabour, Luiz Gustavo Pessoa Pires; Vieira, Cristina Cerqueira; Nery, Lucas Crepaldi Carvalho; Dias, Raphael Figuiredo; Simões E Silva, Ana Cristina",Curr. med. chem,190,1

We aimed to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of patients with digestive cancer. Methods: This was a retrospective study including patients with an inaugural digestive cancer diagnosis discussed for the first time at our center during the weekly digestive oncology reunion (DOR) meeting. The study group was enlisted from March to August 2020, and a control group was sourced from the equivalent period of 2018. Patients with a previous digestive cancer diagnosis/discussion in the DOR were excluded. The following data were collected: demographics, referral origin, tumor staging, first DOR discussion timing, treatment, and outcome. Results: A total of 235 patients were included: 107 in the study group (65.4% male, mean age 71.59 years);128 in the control group (54.7% male, mean age 68.16 years). The mean number of clinical discussions per week was higher in 2018 (13.65 vs. 10.67, p = 0.040), without a difference in the mean number of patients discussed for the first time (inaugural diagnosis) between groups (p = 0.670). In the 2020 study group, more patients were referred to DOR from the emergency room (ER), fewer from the outpatient clinic/hospital wards (p < 0.001), and more were referred after urgent surgery (p = 0.022). There was no difference in the mean waiting time from diagnosis to first DOR discussion (p = 0.087). Tumor staging in colorectal, gastric, and esophageal cancer was not significantly different between the groups (p = 0897, p = 0.168, and p = 0.717). More patients in the study group presented with stage IV pancreatic cancer (p = 0.043). There was no difference in the time span from DOR until the beginning of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.680) or elective surgery (p = 0.198), or from surgery until adjuvant chemotherapy (p = 0.396). Also, there was no difference in 30-day mortality from the first DOR date between the groups (p = 0.742). Conclusion: During the COVID-19 era there was a reduced number of clinical discussions in the DOR, but the number of debated patients with an inaugural digestive cancer diagnosis was similar. In the study group more patients were referred to DOR from the ER, and were referred after urgent surgery, suggesting a delayed demand for clinical attention. Study group patients were not significantly affected by the pandemic regarding timely DOR discussion, beginning of treatment, or 30-day mortality, reflecting the maintenance of the quality of care for digestive cancer patients.","Brito, Mariana Laranjo Ana Sabino Júlia Oliveira Carla Mocanu Irina Fonseca Jorge",Portuguese Journal of Gastroenterology,190,16

One of the major challenges in an online recruitment scenario is to provide good matches between job posts and candidates using a recommender system on the scale. In this paper, we discussed the techniques for applying an embedding-based recommender system for the large scale of job to candidates matching. To learn the comprehensive and effective embedding for job posts and candidates, we have constructed a fused-embedding via different levels of representation learning from raw text, semantic entities and location information. The clusters of fused-embedding of job and candidates are then used to build and train the Faiss index that supports runtime approximate nearest neighbor search for candidate retrieval. After the first stage of candidate retrieval, a second stage reranking model that utilizes other contextual information was used to generate the final matching result. Both offline and online evaluation results indicate a significant improvement of our proposed two-staged embedding-based system in terms of click-through rate (CTR), quality and normalized discounted accumulated gain (nDCG), compared to those obtained from our baseline system. We further described the deployment of the system that supports the million-scale job and candidate matching process at CareerBuilder. The overall improvement of our job to candidate matching system has demonstrated its feasibility and scalability at a major online recruitment site.","Zhao, Jing; Wang, Jingya; Sigdel, Madhav; Zhang, Bopeng; Hoang, Phuong; Liu, Mengshu; Korayem, Mohammed",,190,27

The goal of this study was to quantify changes in medical care during the first wave of the pandemic using radiological examinations as a comprehensive surrogate marker and to determine potential future workload. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of all radiological examinations during the first wave of the pandemic was performed. The number of examinations was compared to time-matched control periods. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of radiological examinations attributed to various medical specialties was conducted and postponed examinations were extrapolated to calculate additional workload in the near future. RESULTS: A total of 596,760 examinations were analyzed. Overall case volumes decreased by an average of 41â% during the shutdown compared to the control period. The most affected radiological modalities were sonography (-54â%), X-ray (-47â%) followed by MRI (-42â%). The most affected medical specialty was trauma and orthopedics (-60â% case volume) followed by general surgery (-49â%). Examination numbers increased during the post-shutdown period leading to a predicted additional workload of up to 22â%.

Country specific multivariable linear models were used to estimate the association between selected variables from MICS and a violent discipline score which captured the average combination of violent disciplinary methods used in the home. A review of the literature informed the development of quantitative assumptions about how COVID-19 would impact the selected variables under a ""high restrictions"" pandemic scenario, approximating conditions expected during a period of intense response measures, and a ""lower restrictions"" scenario with easing of COVID-19 restrictions but with sustained economic impacts. These assumptions were used to estimate changes in violent discipline scores. RESULTS: Under a ""high restrictions"" scenario there would be a 35%-46% increase in violent discipline scores in Nigeria, Mongolia and Suriname, and under a ""lower restrictions"" scenario there would be between a 4%-6% increase in violent discipline scores in these countries. CONCLUSION: Policy makers need to plan for increases in violent discipline during successive waves of lockdowns.","Fabbri, Camilla; Bhatia, Amiya; Petzold, Max; Jugder, Munkhbadar; Guedes, Alessandra; Cappa, Claudia; Devries, Karen",Child Abuse Negl,190,15

Most of the fake news datasets depend on a specific time period. Consequently, the detection models trained on such a dataset have difficulty detecting novel fake news generated by political changes and social changes; they may possibly result in biased output from the input, including specific person names and organizational names. We refer to this problem as \textbf{Diachronic Bias} because it is caused by the creation date of news in each dataset. In this study, we confirm the bias, especially proper nouns including person names, from the deviation of phrase appearances in each dataset. Based on these findings, we propose masking methods using Wikidata to mitigate the influence of person names and validate whether they make fake news detection models robust through experiments with in-domain and out-of-domain data.","Murayama, Taichi; Wakamiya, Shoko; Aramaki, Eiji",,190,26

The impact of the pandemic has been and still is significant within the Member States of the European Union. The introduction focused on identifying and monitoring the pandemic spread in the individual Member States. The research focused on two periods that were compared with each other based on key indicators, i.e., reproduction rate, hospitalized patients, or ICU patients. Identification and monitoring of the above‐mentioned periods were performed by an observational study of collected data mentioned below. Subsequently, an algorithm was proposed, which was to determine an index number of a given country based on key indicators mentioned earlier. The index number is an assessment of the pandemic situation in a given country. The index number calculation in the monitored periods divided the countries into two groups: countries with the index number higher than one and countries with the index number lower than one. The latter can continue using air transport by pandemic situation assessment conducted by the algorithm. The air transport utili-zation rate depends on the second part of the algorithm, where the allowed number of routes is calculated for individual airlines. The use of an algorithm for calculating the index number of individual countries and at the same time monitoring the development of key indicators every 14 days is a suitable method for ensuring the sustainable use of air transport to minimize financial losses. © 2021 by the authors.

We assessed the impact of the pandemic on the oncological patients' visits to a tertiary cancer centre. Methods: We analysed registrations from the administrative data system of in- and outpatients in all of the departments of the Cluj-Napoca Oncology Institute, during March-October 2020, and compared to the same 7-month period of the previous year. Results: The decrease during March-October 2020 was 40.2% for new referrals overall (with the most significant drop in April, of 80%), 52.5% for medical oncology inpatients, 39% for paediatric oncology department inpatients, 69% for radiotherapy inpatients, 34.9% for surgical interventions and 31% decrease of issued pathology reports. The decrease was less important for outpatients: only 10% for medical oncology outpatient department, 33% for radiotherapy and 27% for breast cancer unit outpatients. Imaging investigations were only slightly influenced by the pandemic (reduction of 5% for MRI scans, 19% for mammograms,whereas performed CT scans were even more after the outbreak of COVID-19). Conclusions: Our results show a decrease in the number of patients during the period after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, more for inpatients and less significant for outpatient departments, probably because of the internal circuits reorganization but also because of health care measures taken nationally and locally to limit the spread of the pandemic.","Crisan, C.; Cainap, C.; Deac, A.; Havasi, A.; Balacescu, O.; Balacescu, L.; Bochis, O.; Vlad, C.; Cainap, S.",Journal of Buon,190,16

Consequently, education of students reverted to online platforms or TV station broadcasts. Extracurricular programs have also experienced a setback given the natural prioritization of mandatory school subjects. Meanwhile, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) was implementing a teacher-led extracurricular activity for children of age 10-15 years to prevent substance use and other negative life and social consequences (Lions Quest Skills for Adolescence [LQSFA]). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, LQSFA was difficult to sustain, partly as it was considered extracurricular and partly given its interactive requirement that was difficult to apply through distance learning. Nevertheless, schools' facilitators managed to adapt the program information sharing and communication strategies with the student groups and identified essential sessions allowing continuity of program implementation and utilization of critical program skills during COVID-19 pandemic. The practical implication of the facilitators' assessment of the relevance, value, motivation and feasibility of the implementation of the LQSFA program within the current COVID-19 circumstances calls for the eminent need for adaptation of its implementation modality to meet the current educational delivery circumstances.

Our analysis of the optimal intervention problem extends well-established targeting results to the economic network setting, which requires additional theoretical steps. We prove several results about optimal intervention: it is NP-hard and additionally hard to approximate to a constant factor in polynomial time. In turn, we show that randomizing failure thresholds leads to a version of the problem which is monotone submodular, for which existing powerful approximations in polynomial time can be applied. In addition to optimal intervention, we also show practical consequences of our analysis to other economic network problems: (1) it is computationally hard to calculate expected values in the economic network, and (2) influence maximization algorithms can enable efficient importance sampling and stress testing of large failure scenarios.

However, comprehensive global data analyses for its healthcare management are lacking. METHODS: In this study we have researched through published scientific articles and international health care guidelines to find out actually about our knowledge for this new pandemic from SARS-CoV-2 and related COVID-19 disease that emerged from December 2019 in China in order to better manage this health emergency. RESULTS: The pathogens represented by microorganisms (bacteria, mycetes or viruses) show their effect after days and are responsible for epidemics/pandemics as dangerous as the greater their possibility of transmission, especially by inhalation, and therefore their infectivity. CONCLUSIONS: The appearance of new pathogenic viruses for humans such as the COVID -19, which previously were found only in the animal world occurs through the spillover (is the third documented of an animal coronavirus to humans), it is thought that it could also be the same also for the origin of this virus. Furthermore, the trend of this pandemic in one of the countries most affected by Italy after China was also considered.","Charitos, Ioannis Alexandros; Del Prete, Raffaele; Inchingolo, Francesco; Mosca, Adriana; Carretta, Domenico; Ballini, Andrea; Santacroce, Luigi",Acta Biomed,190,3

Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus elevates heart rate (HR) prior to symptom onset, whether this virus evokes other presymptomatic alterations is unknown. This case study details the presymptomatic impact of COVID-19 on vascular and skeletal muscle function in a young woman [24 yr, 173.5 cm, 89 kg, body mass index (BMI): 29.6 kg·m-2]. Vascular and skeletal muscle function were assessed as part of a separate study with the first and second visits separated by 2 wk. On the evening following the second visit, the participant developed a fever and a rapid antigen test confirmed a positive COVID-19 diagnosis. Compared with the first visit, the participant presented with a markedly elevated HR (â¼30 beats/min) and a lower mean blood pressure (â¼8 mmHg) at the second visit. Vascular function measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, reactive hyperemia, and passive leg movement were all noticeably attenuated (25%-65%) as was leg blood flow during knee extension exercise. Muscle strength was diminished as was ADP-stimulated respiration (30%), assessed in vitro, whereas there was a 25% increase in the apparent Km. Lastly, an elevation in IL-10 was observed prior to symptom onset. Notably, 2.5 mo after diagnosis symptoms of fatigue and cough were still present. Together, these findings provide unique insight into the physiological responses immediately prior to onset of COVID-19 symptoms; they suggest that SARS-CoV-2 negatively impacts vascular and skeletal muscle function prior to the onset of common symptoms and may set the stage for the widespread sequelae observed following COVID-19 diagnosis.NEW & NOTEWORTHY This unique case study details the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on vascular and skeletal muscle function in a young predominantly presymptomatic woman. Prior to COVID-19 diagnosis, substantial reductions in vascular, skeletal muscle, and mitochondrial function were observed along with an elevation in IL-10. This integrative case study indicates that the presymptomatic impact of COVID-19 is widespread and may help elucidate the acute and long-term sequelae of this disease.","Trinity, Joel D; Craig, Jesse C; Fermoyle, Caitlin C; McKenzie, Alec I; Lewis, Matthew T; Park, Soung Hun; Rondina, Matthew T; Richardson, Russell S",J Appl Physiol (1985),190,16

In this study, we investigated the effect of targeting the CD206 receptor with a novel fragment of a Host Defense Peptide (HDP), RP-832c to decrease cytokines that cause fibrosis. RP-832c selectively binds to CD206 on M2 polarized bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDM) in vitro , resulting in a time-dependent decrease in CD206 expression, and a transient increase in M1 marker TNF&#945;, which resolves over a 24hr period. To elucidate the antifibrotic effect of RP-832c, we used a murine model of bleomycin (BLM) -induced early-stage pulmonary fibrosis. RP-832c significantly reduced bleomycin-induced fibrosis in a dosage dependent manner, as well as decreased CD206, TGF-ß1 and &#945;-SMA expression in mouse lungs. Interestingly we did not observe any changes in the resident alveolar macrophage marker CD170 expression. Similarly, in an established model of lung fibrosis, RP-832c significantly decreased fibrosis in the lung, as well as significantly decreased inflammatory cytokines TNF&#945;, IL-6, IL-10, INF-Î³, CXCL1/2, and fibrosis markers TGF-ß1 and MMP-13. In comparison with FDA approved drugs, Nintedanib and Pirfenidone, RP-832c exhibited a similar reduction in fibrosis compared to Pirfenidone, and to a greater extent than Nintedanib, with no apparent toxicities observed on body weight or blood chemistry. In summary, RP-832c is a potential agent to mitigate the overactivity of M2 macrophages in pathogenesis several pulmonary fibrotic diseases, including SARS-CoV-2 induced lung fibrosis.","Ghebremedhin, Anghesom; Salam, Ahmad Bin; Adu-Addai, Benjamin; Noonan, Steve; Stratton, Richard; Ahmed, Md Shakir Uddin; Khantwal, Chandra; Martin, George R; Lin, Huixian; Andrews, Chris; Karanam, Balasubramanyam; Rudloff, Udo; Lopez, Henry; Jaynes, Jesse; Yates, Clayton",,190,13

Vacuolar cation/H+ exchangers (CAXs) have long been recognized as 'housekeeping' components in cellular Ca2+ and trace metal homeostasis, being involved in a range of key cellular and physiological processes. However, the mechanisms that drive functional activation of the transporters are largely unknown. In the present study, we investigated the function of a putative grapevine CAX-interacting protein, VvCXIP4, by testing its ability to activate VvCAX3, previously characterized as a tonoplast-localized Ca2+/H+ exchanger. VvCAX3 contains an autoinhibitory domain that drives inactivation of the transporter and thus, is incapable of suppressing the Ca2+-hypersensitive phenotype of the S. cerevisiae mutant K667. In this study, the co-expression of VvCXIP4 and VvCAX3 in this strain efficiently rescued its growth defect at high Ca2+ levels. Flow cytometry experiments showed that yeast harboring both proteins effectively accumulated higher Ca2+ levels than cells expressing each of the proteins separately. Bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) assays allowed visualization of the direct interaction between the proteins in tobacco plants and in yeast, and also showed the self-interaction of VvCAX3 but not of VvCXIP4. Subcellular localization studies showed that, despite being primarily localized to the nucleus, VvCXIP4 is able to move to other cell compartments upon a Ca2+ stimulus, becoming prone to interaction with the tonoplast-localized VvCAX3. qPCR analysis showed that both genes are more expressed in grapevine stems and leaves, followed by the roots, and that the steady-state transcript levels were higher in the pulp than in the skin of grape berries. Also, both VvCXIP4 and VvCAX3 were upregulated by Ca2+ and Na+, indicating they share common regulatory mechanisms. However, VvCXIP4 was also upregulated by Li+, Cu2+ and Mn2+, and its expression increased steadily throughout grape berry development, contrary to VvCAX3, suggesting additional physiological roles for VvCXIP4, including the regulation of VvCAXs not yet functionally characterized. The main novelty of the present study was the demonstration of physical interaction between CXIP and CAX proteins from a woody plant model by BiFC assays, demonstrating the intracellular mobilization of CXIPs in response to Ca2+.","Martins, Viviana; Gerós, Hernâni",Planta,190,24

We aimed to investigate the prevalence of delirium and coma, and risk factors for delirium in critically ill patients with COVID-19, to aid the development of strategies to mitigate delirium and associated sequelae. METHODS: This multicentre cohort study included 69 adult intensive care units (ICUs), across 14 countries. We included all patients (aged &#8805;18 years) admitted to participating ICUs with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection before April 28, 2020. Patients who were moribund or had life-support measures withdrawn within 24 h of ICU admission, prisoners, patients with pre-existing mental illness, neurodegenerative disorders, congenital or acquired brain damage, hepatic coma, drug overdose, suicide attempt, or those who were blind or deaf were excluded. We collected de-identified data from electronic health records on patient demographics, delirium and coma assessments, and management strategies for a 21-day period. Additional data on ventilator support, ICU length of stay, and vital status was collected for a 28-day period. The primary outcome was to determine the prevalence of delirium and coma and to investigate any associated risk factors associated with development of delirium the next day. We also investigated predictors of number of days alive without delirium or coma. These outcomes were investigated using multivariable regression. FINDINGS: Between Jan 20 and April 28, 2020, 4530 patients with COVID-19 were admitted to 69 ICUs, of whom 2088 patients were included in the study cohort. The median age of patients was 64 years (IQR 54 to 71) with a median Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II of 40·0 (30·0 to 53·0). 1397 (66·9%) of 2088 patients were invasively mechanically ventilated on the day of ICU admission and 1827 (87·5%) were invasively mechanical ventilated at some point during hospitalisation. Infusion with sedatives while on mechanical ventilation was common: 1337 (64·0%) of 2088 patients were given benzodiazepines for a median of 7·0 days (4·0 to 12·0) and 1481 (70·9%) were given propofol for a median of 7·0 days (4·0 to 11·0). Median Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale score while on invasive mechanical ventilation was -4 (-5 to -3). 1704 (81·6%) of 2088 patients were comatose for a median of 10·0 days (6·0 to 15·0) and 1147 (54·9%) were delirious for a median of 3·0 days (2·0 to 6·0). Mechanical ventilation, use of restraints, and benzodiazepine, opioid, and vasopressor infusions, and antipsychotics were each associated with a higher risk of delirium the next day (all p&#8804;0·04), whereas family visitation (in person or virtual) was associated with a lower risk of delirium (p<0·0001). During the 21-day study period, patients were alive without delirium or coma for a median of 5·0 days (0·0 to 14·0). At baseline, older age, higher SAPS II scores, male sex, smoking or alcohol abuse, use of vasopressors on day 1, and invasive mechanical ventilation on day 1 were independently associated with fewer days alive and free of delirium and coma (all p<0·01). 601 (28·8%) of 2088 patients died within 28 days of admission, with most of those deaths occurring in the ICU. INTERPRETATION: Acute brain dysfunction was highly prevalent and prolonged in critically ill patients with COVID-19. Benzodiazepine use and lack of family visitation were identified as modifiable risk factors for delirium, and thus these data present an opportunity to reduce acute brain dysfunction in patients with COVID-19. FUNDING: None.

By using ileum-derived organoids, we show that the expression of anti-microbial peptides (AMPs) and anti-viral peptides (AVPs) can be induced by IL22. In addition, we identified a bacterial and a viral route, both leading to IL22 production by T cells, but via different pathways. Bacterial products, such as LPS, induce enterocyte-secreted SAA1, which triggers the secretion of IL6 in fibroblasts, and subsequently IL22 in T cells. This IL22 induction can then be enhanced by macrophage-derived TNF&#945; in two ways: by enhancing the responsiveness of T cells to IL6 and by increasing the expression of IL6 by fibroblasts. Viral infections of intestinal cells induce IFNß1 and subsequently IL7. IFNß1 can induce the expression of IL6 in fibroblasts and the combined activity of IL6 and IL7 can then induce IL22 expression in T cells. We also show that IL22 reduces the expression of viral entry receptors (e.g. ACE2, TMPRSS2, DPP4, CD46 and TNFRSF14), increases the expression of anti-viral proteins (e.g. RSAD2, AOS, ISG20 and Mx1) and, consequently, reduces the viral infection of neighboring cells. Overall, our data indicates that IL22 contributes to the innate responses against both bacteria and viruses.","Klooster, Jean Paul Ten; Bol-Schoenmakers, Marianne; van Summeren, Kitty; van Vliet, Arno L W; de Haan, Cornelis A M; van Kuppeveld, Frank J M; Verkoeijen, Saertje; Pieters, Raymond",Commun Biol,190,17

Currently, a few studies include octogenarian patients and none of them analyze the impact of functional status on this health outcome. Our objective is to describe the characteristics of patients older than 80 years hospitalized for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), to determine the mortality rate and to identify associated factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective observational study carried out on patients over 80 years admitted for COVID-19 in a Geriatrics Service. Sociodemographic, clinical, functional, mental, analytical, radiological, therapeutic and healthcare variables were collected. The factors associated with in-hospital lethality were analyzed by bivariate analysis. RESULTS: 58 cases with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were included, mean age 88.3 ± 5.4 years, 69% women, 65.5% moderate-severe cognitive impairment and previous Barthel index 40.66 ± 36. The main symptoms were fever (60,3%), dyspnea (53.4%) and deterioration of functional condition (50%). The most frequent comorbidities were cardiovascular disease (75.9%), hypertension (HT) (74.1%) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) (50%). A mortality rate of 41,4% was detected and the associated factors were: severe functional dependence (OR = 3.8 [1.2-12.2]), moderate-severe cognitive impairment (OR = 4.9 [1-25.4]) and CKD (OR = 3.2 [1.1-9.7]). CONCLUSION: High mortality rates are observed in older patients hospitalized for COVID-19, with a higher risk of dying in those with severe functional dependence or cognitive impairment. These findings reinforce the value of Geriatric Assessment to develop strategies to adapt diagnostic and therapeutic decision-making and to optimize care for elderly patients in the event of a new epidemic outbreak.","Gutiérrez Rodríguez, José; Montero Muñoz, Javier; Jiménez Muela, Francisco; Guirola García-Prendes, Cristina; Martínez Rivera, Marta; Gómez Armas, Laura",Rev. esp. geriatr. gerontol.

METHODS: The Italian Stroke Organization performed a multicenter study involving 93 Italian Stroke Units. We collected information on hospital admissions for cerebrovascular events from March 1 to March 31, 2020 (study period), and from March 1 to March 31, 2019 (control period). RESULTS: Ischemic strokes decreased from 2399 in 2019 to 1810 in 2020, with a corresponding hospitalization rate ratio (RR) of 0.75 ([95% CI, 0.71-0.80] P<0.001); intracerebral hemorrhages decreased from 400 to 322 (hospitalization RR, 0.81 [95% CI, 0.69-0.93]; P=0.004), and transient ischemic attacks decreased from 322 to 196 (hospitalization RR, 0.61 [95% CI, 0.51-0.73]; P<0.001). Hospitalizations decreased in Northern, Central, and Southern Italy. Intravenous thrombolyses decreased from 531 (22.1%) in 2019 to 345 in 2020 (19.1%; RR, 0.86 [95% CI, 0.75-0.99]; P=0.032), while primary endovascular procedures increased in Northern Italy (RR, 1.61 [95% CI, 1.13-2.32]; P=0.008). We found no correlation (P=0.517) between the hospitalization RRs for all strokes or transient ischemic attack and COVID-19 incidence in the different areas. CONCLUSIONS: Hospitalizations for stroke or transient ischemic attacks across Italy were reduced during the worst period of the COVID-19 outbreak. Intravenous thrombolytic treatments also decreased, while endovascular treatments remained unchanged and even increased in the area of maximum expression of the outbreak. Limited hospitalization of the less severe patients and delays in hospital admission, due to overcharge of the emergency system by COVID-19 patients, may explain these data.","Sacco, Simona; Ricci, Stefano; Ornello, Raffaele; Eusebi, Paolo; Petraglia, Luca; Toni, Danilo",Stroke,190,20

In this study we compare the characteristics and outcomes of Covid-19 patients who are and who are not healthcare workers (HCW). METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 2,842 adult patients with known HCW status and a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test presenting to a large academic medical center emergency department (ED) in New York State from March 21 2020 through June 2020. Early in the pandemic we instituted a policy to collect data on patient occupation and exposures to suspected Covid-19. The primary outcome was hospital admission. Secondary outcomes were ICU admission, need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV), and mortality. We compared baseline characteristics and outcomes of Covid-19 adult patients based on whether they were or were not HCW using univariable and multivariable analyses. RESULTS: Of 2,842 adult patients (mean age 53+/-19 years, 53% male) 193 (6.8%) were HCWs and 2,649 (93.2%) were not HCWs. Compared with non-HCW, HCWs were younger (43 vs 53 years, P<0.001), more likely female (118/193 [61%] vs 1211/2649 [46%], P<0.001), and more likely to have a known Covid-19 exposure (161/193 [83%] vs 946/2649 [36%], P<0.001), but had fewer comorbidities. On presentation to the ED, HCW also had lower frequencies of tachypnea (12/193 [6%] vs 426/2649 [16%], P<0.01), hypoxemia (15/193 [8%] vs 564/2649 [21%], P<0.01), bilateral opacities on imaging (38/193 [20%] vs 1189/2649 [45%], P<0.001), and lymphocytopenia (6/193 [3%] vs 532/2649 [20%], P<0.01) compared to non-HCWs. Direct discharges home from the ED were more frequent in HCW 154/193 (80%) vs 1275/2649 (48%) p<0.001). Hospital admissions (38/193 [20%] vs 1264/2694 [47%], P<0.001), ICU admissions (7/193 [3%] vs 321/2694 [12%], P<0.001), need for IMV (6/193 [3%] vs 321/2694 [12%], P<0.001) and mortality (2/193 [1%] vs 219/2694 [8%], P<0.01) were lower than among non-HCW. After controlling for age, sex, comorbidities, presenting vital signs and radiographic imaging, HCW were less likely to be admitted (OR 0.6, 95%CI 0.3-0.9) than non HCW. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with non HCW, HCW with Covid-19 were younger, had less severe illness, and were less likely to be admitted.","Kim, Rachel; Nachman, Sharon; Fernandes, Rafael; Meyers, Kristen; Taylor, Maria; LeBlanc, Debra; Singer, Adam J",PLoS One,190,1

Objective: To characterize the clinical manifestations and course of the first cases of contagion by SARS-CoV-2 in doctors of Peru. Methodology: We present a series of six cases of doctors infected by SARS-CoV-2, with confirmed positivity for COVID-19, showing the daily evolution from the diagnosis of the disease, its main signs and symptoms, evolution, and until the outcome in each case. Results: Five were men. The median age was 28 years (interquartile range: 27 to 33). In three cases the physician worked more than 12 hours a day in emergency and hospitalization services and not wear a mask at all times. The most frequent symptoms were axillary temperature above 38°C, malaise, dry cough, and odynophagia (the latter in three of the cases). The diagnosis was made at a median of 3 days (interquartile range: 3 to 4 days). The symptoms that persisted the most were dry cough (present during ten days in four doctors). Dysgeusia was the only symptom with the most extended duration (15 days in only one doctor). In the six cases, the course was favorable. However, these doctors found it difficult to return to functions in their hospital centers adequately. Discussion: Despite a small number of cases, it is the first report detailing the evolution of symptoms day by day, which can help for occupational health and even for case surveillance and monitoring.","Vilela-Estrada, Martín A; Benites-Flores, Irwing R; García-Saavedra, Mario B; Mejia, Christian R",Medwave,190,23

The outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002/2003 has demonstrated human vulnerability to (Coronavirus) CoV epidemics. Neither vaccines nor therapeutics are available against human and animal CoVs. Knowledge of host cell proteins that take part in pivotal virus-host interactions could define broad-spectrum antiviral targets. In this study, we used a systems biology approach employing a genome-wide yeast-two hybrid interaction screen to identify immunopilins (PPIA, PPIB, PPIH, PPIG, FKBP1A, FKBP1B) as interaction partners of the CoV non-structural protein 1 (Nsp1). These molecules modulate the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway that plays an important role in immune cell activation. Overexpression of NSP1 and infection with live SARS-CoV strongly increased signalling through the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway and enhanced the induction of interleukin 2, compatible with late-stage immunopathogenicity and long-term cytokine dysregulation as observed in severe SARS cases. Conversely, inhibition of cyclophilins by cyclosporine A (CspA) blocked the replication of CoVs of all genera, including SARS-CoV, human CoV-229E and -NL-63, feline CoV, as well as avian infectious bronchitis virus. Non-immunosuppressive derivatives of CspA might serve as broad-range CoV inhibitors applicable against emerging CoVs as well as ubiquitous pathogens of humans and livestock.","Pfefferle, Susanne; Schöpf, Julia; Kögl, Manfred; Friedel, Caroline C.; Müller, Marcel A.; Carbajo-Lozoya, Javier; Stellberger, Thorsten; von Dall’Armi, Ekatarina; Herzog, Petra; Kallies, Stefan; Niemeyer, Daniela; Ditt, Vanessa; Kuri, Thomas; Züst, Roland; Pumpor, Ksenia; Hilgenfeld, Rolf; Schwarz, Frank; Zimmer, Ralf; Steffen, Imke; Weber, Friedemann; Thiel, Volker; Herrler, Georg; Thiel, Heinz-Jürgen; Schwegmann-Weßels, Christel; Pöhlmann, Stefan; Haas, Jürgen; Drosten, Christian; von Brunn, Albrecht",PLoS Pathog,190,3

The phenomenon of viral replication during intensive care is well known, even in patients without a history of immunosuppression, but it usually does not have a clinical impact. Systemic reactivation leads to viral DNA in blood. It remains unclear whether this replication is a marker of morbimortality or a true pathogenic process. Therefore, it is unclear what medical treatment is most appropriate for simple replication. In organ damage suspected to be induced by herpes virus, there is no consensus on the most appropriate treatment duration. Here, we report a rarely described case of multiorgan failure implicating herpes simplex virus and discuss its treatment. CASE REPORT: A 53-year-old Caucasian immunosuppressed woman was admitted to the intensive care unit for septic shock. She presented pneumonia due to Klebsiella pneumoniae. Two weeks after admission, she showed multiorgan failure with acute respiratory distress syndrome and circulation failure. She had digestive and cutaneous lesions typical of herpes simplex virus 1. Blood and respiratory polymerase chain reaction was strongly herpes simplex virus-1 positive. No other bacteria, fungi, or viruses were found. The evolution was rapidly favorable after the initiation of antiviral treatment. Treatment was stopped after 3 weeks of well-conducted antiviral therapy. Curative-dose treatment was interrupted despite continuous strongly positive blood polymerase chain reaction results. In this context, prophylactic treatment was continued. CONCLUSION: We report an exceptional presentation of multiorgan failure in the intensive care unit due to herpes simplex virus-1. The diagnosis was made based on typical herpes simplex virus-1 visceral lesions and the absence of other responsible microorganisms. Intense viral replication is a key diagnostic element. There is no consensus regarding the most appropriate treatment duration, but such decisions should not be based on blood polymerase chain reaction.","Boquet, Amélie; Boulay, Guillaume; Hautin, Etienne; Mottard, Nicolas",J Med Case Rep,190,16

To establish an infection and spread, MERS-CoV, like most other viruses, must navigate through an intricate network of antiviral host responses. Besides the well-known type I interferon (IFN-α/β) response, the protein kinase R (PKR)-mediated stress response is being recognized as an important innate response pathway. Upon detecting viral dsRNA, PKR phosphorylates eIF2α, leading to the inhibition of cellular and viral translation and the formation of stress granules (SGs), which are increasingly recognized as platforms for antiviral signaling pathways. It is unknown whether cellular infection by MERS-CoV activates the stress response pathway or whether the virus has evolved strategies to suppress this infection-limiting pathway. Here, we show that cellular infection with MERS-CoV does not lead to the formation of SGs. By transiently expressing the MERS-CoV accessory proteins individually, we identified a role of protein 4a (p4a) in preventing activation of the stress response pathway. Expression of MERS-CoV p4a impeded dsRNA-mediated PKR activation, thereby rescuing translation inhibition and preventing SG formation. In contrast, p4a failed to suppress stress response pathway activation that is independent of PKR and dsRNA. MERS-CoV p4a is a dsRNA binding protein. Mutation of the dsRNA binding motif in p4a disrupted its PKR antagonistic activity. By inserting p4a in a picornavirus lacking its natural PKR antagonist, we showed that p4a exerts PKR antagonistic activity also under infection conditions. However, a recombinant MERS-CoV deficient in p4a expression still suppressed SG formation, indicating the expression of at least one other stress response antagonist. This virus also suppressed the dsRNA-independent stress response pathway. Thus, MERS-CoV interferes with antiviral stress responses using at least two different mechanisms, with p4a suppressing the PKR-dependent stress response pathway, probably by sequestering dsRNA. MERS-CoV p4a represents the first coronavirus stress response antagonist described.","Rabouw, Huib H.; Langereis, Martijn A.; Knaap, Robert C.

We investigate the asymmetrical interplay between the two types of spreading dynamics, each occurring on its own layer, by focusing on the two fundamental quantities underlying any spreading process: epidemic threshold and the final infection ratio. We find that an epidemic outbreak on the contact layer can induce an outbreak on the communication layer, and information spreading can effectively raise the epidemic threshold. When structural correlation exists between the two layers, the information threshold remains unchanged but the epidemic threshold can be enhanced, making the contact layer more resilient to epidemic outbreak.

However, a more sensitive and accurate diagnostic tool was required. Therefore, droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) was suggested as an alternative method. Here, we evaluated the performance of ddPCR to detect SARS-CoV-2 and compared it to the performance of RT-qPCR. METHODS: The analytical performances, including limit of blank and limit of detection, were established using positive and negative SARS-CoV-2 reference materials. A total of 366 RNA extracts (173 positive and 193 negative by RT-qPCR) were collected from four institutions and tested with a Bio-Rad SARS-CoV-2 ddPCR kit that detects the SARS-CoV-2 genome using primers for N1 and N2. RESULTS: Limit of blank was set at 0, and the limits of detection of N1 and N2 were 1.99 copies/μL and 5.18 copies/μL, respectively. Linearity was evaluated using serial dilution samples, which demonstrated good results (R(2): 0.999, linear range: 5.88–6825.25 copies/μL for N1 and R(2): 0.999, 5.53–5855.47 copies/μL for N2). The results of ddPCR and RT-qPCR revealed substantial agreement (Cohen’s kappa: 0.639, p < 0.01). The 63 samples with positive ddPCR but negative RT-qPCR showed low copy numbers, and 55% of them had COVID-19-related symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Droplet digital polymerase chain reaction demonstrated excellent sensitivity for SARS-Cov-2 detection and consistently agreed with the results from conventional RT-qPCR. Furthermore, ddPCR provided quantitative data that can be used to monitor changes in the viral load of patients with COVID-19.

Patients with hematologic malignancies appear to have a greater risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe disease due to myelosuppression and lymphopenia. The first challenge, therefore, is how to continue to deliver effective, curative therapy to vulnerable patients and at the same time avoid exposing them, and their health care teams (HCT), to SARS-CoV-2. An additional challenge is the timely completion of the diagnostic and staging studies required to formulate appropriate treatment plans. Deferred procedures and avoidance of multiple trips to the surgical, diagnostic, and laboratory suites require same day consolidation of all procedures.

RECENT FINDINGS: Safe and efficient care of pediatric patients with COVID-19 can be delivered with the proper planning, coordination, supplies, and staff preparation. From the start of the pandemic, pediatric anesthesiologists from around the world contributed important insights and shared experience as to how best to adapt anesthesia care for children with COVID-19 requiring general anesthesia and sedation. Although initial efforts focused on creating safe airway management processes, the role of anesthesiologists as perioperative leaders quickly extended to ensuring well-coordinated management of COVID-19 patients throughout the hospital for procedures, including preprocedure testing, patient transport, operating room setup, and ensuring the safety of staff. Several important areas remain not well studied including, the timing of rescheduling elective procedures following COVID-19 infection, the perioperative implications of re-infection, and future considerations of managing vaccinated children.

DESIGN: A cross‐sectional study. METHODS: 114 patients with COVID‐19 admitted to a mobile cabin hospital in Wuhan, Hubei Province, in February 2020 were enrolled by a convenience sampling method. The Chinese version of the Mishel Illness Uncertainty Scale (MUIS) was used to assess patients’ degree of illness uncertainty, and multiple regression analysis was used to explore the influencing factors. RESULTS: The average total score of MUIS (Chinese version) was 52.22 ± 12.51, indicating a moderate level of illness uncertainty. The dimension unpredictability turned out to have the highest mean score: 2.88 ± 0.90. The multiple stepwise regression analysis showed that female (t = 2.462, p = .015), monthly family income not less than RMB 10,000 (t = −2.095, p = .039), and disease duration of 28 days or more (t = 2.249, p = .027) were independent influencing factors of illness uncertainty. CONCLUSION: Patients with COVID‐19 are at a moderate level of illness uncertainty. Medical staffs should pay more attention to female patients, patients with lower monthly family income, patients with the prolonged disease, and take targeted interventions to help them reduce illness uncertainty. IMPACT: Facing the brand new and unknown infectious disease, patients confirmed of COVID‐19 suffer from immense physical and psychological stress, where illness uncertainty is a major stressor that troubles patients.

Usually, viral protein targets host proteins in an organized fashion. The expression of any viral gene depends mostly on the host translational machinery. Recent studies report the great significance of codon usage biases in establishing host-viral protein-protein interactions (PPI). Exploring the codon usage patterns between a pair of co-evolved host and viral proteins may present novel insight into the host-viral protein interactomes during disease pathogenesis. Leveraging the similarity (and dissimilarity) in codon usage patterns, we propose a computational scheme to recreate the host-viral protein-protein interaction network. We use host proteins from seventeen (17) essential signaling pathways for our current work towards understanding the possible targeting mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. We infer both negatively and positively interacting edges in the network. Further, extensive analysis is performed to understand the host PPI network topologically and the attacking behavior of the viral proteins. Our study reveals that viral proteins mostly utilize codons, rare in the targeted host proteins (negatively correlated interaction). Among non-structural proteins, NSP3 and structural protein, Spike (S) protein, are the most influential proteins in interacting multiple host proteins. While ranking the most affected pathways, MAPK pathways observe to be the worst affected during the COVID-19 disease. Several proteins participating in multiple pathways are highly central in host PPI and mostly targeted by multiple viral proteins. We observe many potential targets (host proteins) from the affected pathways associated with the various drugs molecules including Arsenic trioxide, Dexamethasone, Hydroxychloroquine, Ritonavir, and Interferon beta, which are either under trail or in use during COVID-19.","Das, Jayanta Kumar; Chakraborty, Subhadip; Roy, Swarup",J Biomed Inform,190,4

Statins could potentiate the ASA therapy. METHODS: This is a series of 14 cases with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. All patients underwent the ASA therapy. Those who had risk factors for vascular disease also underwent the high-potency statin therapy. When symptoms were totally or practically resolved, patients were discharged and advised to continue medications for a complementary time, according to the clinical evolution of each patient. RESULTS: The mean age of monitored patients was 48.6 years. A total of 78.6% patients presented with at least one comorbidity, which could have contributed as a risk factor for a poor prognosis in the evolution of COVID-19. Four patients had secondary bacterial infections; three patients needed hospitalization. None of the cases progress to stage III, and all patients had remission of symptoms, with 100% survival. CONCLUSIONS: the process of endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 involves disseminated thrombosis, initially microvascular and later expansion into larger vessels. ASA could act as a secondary prophylaxis and prevent thrombosis from developing and reaching stage III of the disease.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to compare psychobehavioral responses in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Comparable cross-sectional surveys were administered to adults in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom during the early phase of the epidemic in each setting. Explanatory variables included demographics, risk perception, knowledge of COVID-19, anxiety level, and preventive behaviors. Responses were weighted according to census data. Logistic regression models, including effect modification to quantify setting differences, were used to assess the association between the explanatory variables and the adoption of social distancing measures. RESULTS: Data from 3431 complete responses (Hong Kong, 1663; United Kingdom, 1768) were analyzed. Perceived severity of symptoms differed by setting, with weighted percentages of 96.8% for Hong Kong (1621/1663) and 19.9% for the United Kingdom (366/1768). A large proportion of respondents were abnormally or borderline anxious (Hong Kong: 1077/1603, 60.0%; United Kingdom: 812/1768, 46.5%) and regarded direct contact with infected individuals as the transmission route of COVID-19 (Hong Kong: 94.0%-98.5%; United Kingdom: 69.2%-93.5%; all percentages weighted), with Hong Kong identifying additional routes. Hong Kong reported high levels of adoption of various social distancing measures (Hong Kong: 32.6%-93.7%; United Kingdom: 17.6%-59.0%) and mask-wearing (Hong Kong: 98.8% (1647/1663); United Kingdom: 3.1% (53/1768)). The impact of perceived severity of symptoms and perceived ease of transmission of COVID-19 on the adoption of social distancing measures varied by setting. In Hong Kong, these factors had no impact, whereas in the United Kingdom, those who perceived their symptom severity as “high” were more likely to adopt social distancing (adjusted odds ratios [aORs] 1.58-3.01), and those who perceived transmission as “easy” were prone to adopt both general social distancing (aOR 2.00, 95% CI 1.57-2.55) and contact avoidance (aOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.41-2.30). The impact of anxiety on adopting social distancing did not vary by setting. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that health officials should ascertain baseline levels of risk perception and knowledge in populations, as well as prior sensitization to infectious disease outbreaks, during the development of mitigation strategies. Risk should be communicated through suitable media channels—and trust should be maintained—while early intervention remains the cornerstone of effective outbreak response.","Bowman, Leigh; Kwok, Kin On; Redd, Rozlyn; Yi, Yuanyuan; Ward, Helen; Wei, Wan In; Atchison, Christina; Wong, Samuel Yeung-Shan",J Med Internet Res,190,1

The B.1.617.2 (delta) variant of concern is causing a new wave of infections in many countries, mostly affecting unvaccinated individuals, and has become globally dominant. We show that these variants dampen the in vitro potency of vaccine-elicited serum neutralizing antibodies and provide a structural framework for describing the impact of individual mutations on immune evasion. Mutations in the B.1.617.1 (kappa) and B.1.617.2 (delta) spike glycoproteins abrogate recognition by several monoclonal antibodies via alteration of key antigenic sites, including an unexpected remodeling of the B.1.617.2 (delta) N-terminal domain. The binding affinity of the B.1.617.1 (kappa) and B.1.617.2 (delta) receptor-binding domain for ACE2 is comparable to the ancestral virus whereas B.1.617.2+ (delta+) exhibits markedly reduced affinity.

However, there is no consensus on the definition and measurement of resilience in the context of physical disease. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to summarize the range of definitions of physical disease resilience and the approaches taken to study it in studies examining physical disease and its relationship to resilient outcomes. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched from inception to March 2013 for studies in which physical disease was assessed for its association with resilient outcomes. Article screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were carried out independently by 2 reviewers, with disagreements being resolved by a third reviewer. The results were combined using a narrative technique. RESULTS: Of 2280 articles, 12 met the inclusion criteria. Of these studies, 1 was of high quality, 9 were of moderate quality, and 2 were low quality. The common findings were that resilience involves maintaining healthy levels of functioning following adversity and that it is a dynamic process not a personality trait. Studies either assessed resilience based on observed outcomes or via resilience measurement scales. They either considered physical disease as an adversity leading to resilience or as a variable modifying the relationship between adversity and resilience. CONCLUSION: This work begins building consensus as to the approach to take when defining and measuring physical disease resilience. Resilience should be considered as a dynamic process that varies across the life-course and across different domains, therefore the choice of a resilience measure should reflect this.","Johnston, Marjorie C.; Porteous, Terry; Crilly, Michael A.; Burton, Christopher D.; Elliott, Alison; Iversen, Lisa; McArdle, Karen; Murray, Alison; Phillips, Louise H.; Black, Corri",Psychosomatics,190,28

Testing strategies focussing on patients with COVID-19 require assays that are high-throughput, low-risk of infection, and with small sample volumes. Antigen surveillance can be used to identify exposure to pathogens and measure acute infections. Methods: A total of 914 serum samples, collected from 309 currently infected COVID-19 patients, 48 recovered ones, and 410 non-COVID-19 patients, were used to measure N protein antigen levels by a chemilumineseent immunoassay. Diagnostic performances were analyzed in different periods after onset. Results: There was a high level of N protein antigen in COVID-19 patients (0.56 COI), comparing to the recovered patients (0.12 COI) and controls (0.19 COI). In receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis, the area under the curve of serum N protein antigen was 0.911 in the first week after onset. In this period, Sensitivity and specificity of serologic N protein antigen testing was 76.27 and 98.78%. Diagnosis performance of specific antibodies became better from the third week after onset. Subgroup analysis suggested that severe patients had higher levels of antigens than mild patients. Conclusions: High level of serum antigen suggested early infection and serious illness. Serum N protein antigen testing by chemiluminescence immunoassay is considered as a viable assay used to improve diagnostic sensitivity for current patients.","Deng, Qiaoling; Ye, Guangming; Pan, Yunbao; Xie, Wen; Yang, Gui; Li, Zhiqiang; Li, Yirong",Front Med (Lausanne),190,24

The worldwide spread of the disease has led to a public health quarantine where health care professionals are at high risk of infection. In this context, telemedicine has been promoted and scaled up to reduce the risk of transmission. This study aims to demonstrate that a combined framework based on telematics and in-person clinical encounter not only ensures medical care but the safety of healthcare professionals and patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Descriptive observational study on the follow-up of patients during the COVID19 Pandemic, combining telephone and traditional. RESULTS: A total of 5031 telephone calls were made, differentiating between medical referrals, specialised primary care visits, and outpatient consultation. They were classified as successful, required an in-person visit, or no successful telephone contact. Furthermore, we divided them into 2 groups: resolved and unresolved. 53% of all telematic visits were successful. CONCLUSIONS: Telematic medical systems are a feasible option in a orthopedics department and an interesting resource to preserve once the pandemic is resolved. Future lines of research should be opened to improve system success, analyze its cost-effectiveness ratio, and correct any legal conflicts that may exist.","Miguela Álvarez, S.M.; Bartra Ylla, A.; Salvador Carreño, J.; Castillón, P.; García Cardona, C.; Anglès Crespo, F.",Rev Esp Cir Ortop Traumatol,190,3

We use the actual observations of new cases and deaths. First, we deal with short term prediction, namely daily prediction. We propose the use of the golden steady state Kalman Filter, which is designed to have parameters related to the golden section. It was found that the proposed golden steady state Kalman Filter has a satisfactory behavior compared with the classical mean or average filter. Secondly, we deal with long term prediction, for example average prediction per quarantine period (14 days). We propose to process blocks of measurements of time window corresponding for example to the quarantine period in order to predict the average of cases and deaths using steady state Kalman Filter. It was found that the proposed golden steady state Kalman Filter produces more reliable predictions than the classical mean or average filter does. The use of steady state Kalman Filter for cases and deaths prediction of Covid-19 can be effective for resources and prevention measures planning.","Assimakis, N.; Adam, M.; Ktena, A.; Manasis, C.",Results Phys,190,26

We investigated the association between psychological outcomes and physical symptoms among healthcare workers. Methods Healthcare workers from 5 major hospitals, involved in the care for COVID-19 patients, in Singapore and India were invited to participate in a study by performing a self-administered questionnaire within the period of February 19 to April 17, 2020. Healthcare workers included doctors, nurses, allied healthcare workers, administrators, clerical staff and maintenance workers. This questionnaire collected information on demographics, medical history, symptom prevalence in the past month, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) and the Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R) instrument. The prevalence of physical symptoms displayed by healthcare workers and the associations between physical symptoms and psychological outcomes of depression, anxiety, stress, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were evaluated. Results Out of the 906 healthcare workers who participated in the survey, 48 (5.3%) screened positive for moderate to very-severe depression, 79 (8.7%) for moderate to extremely-severe anxiety, 20 (2.2%) for moderate to extremely-severe stress, and 34 (3.8%) for moderate to severe levels of psychological distress. The commonest reported symptom was headache (32.3%), with a large number of participants (33.4%) reporting more than four symptoms. Participants who had experienced symptoms in the preceding month were more likely to be older, have pre-existing comorbidities and a positive screen for depression, anxiety, stress, and PTSD. After adjusting for age, gender and comorbidities, it was found that depression (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.54–5.07, p = 0.001), anxiety (OR 2.18, 95% CI 1.36–3.48, p = 0.001), stress (OR 3.06, 95% CI 1.27–7.41, p = 0.13), and PTSD (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.12–4.35, p = 0.023) remained significantly associated with the presence of physical symptoms experienced in the preceding month. Linear regression revealed that the presence of physical symptoms was associated with higher mean scores in the IES-R, DASS Anxiety, Stress and Depression subscales. Conclusions Our study demonstrates a significant association between the prevalence of physical symptoms and psychological outcomes among healthcare workers during the COVID-19 outbreak. We postulate that this association may be bi-directional, and that timely psychological interventions for healthcare workers with physical symptoms should be considered once an infection has been excluded.","Chew, Nicholas W.S.; Lee, Grace K.H.; Tan, Benjamin Y.Q.; Jing, Mingxue; Goh, Yihui; Ngiam, Nicholas J.H.; Yeo, Leonard L.L.; Ahmad, Aftab; Ahmed Khan, Faheem; Napolean Shanmugam, Ganesh; Sharma, Arvind K.; Komalkumar, R.

Millions of people worldwide have been affected and cases continue to rise. Health organizations have focused on creating vaccines to combat SARS-CoV-19 and have successfully formulated new vaccines to distribute globally. However, rare blood clots have been reported on patients receiving viral vector vaccines, halting the distribution and restricting the vaccine's use to limited population. BNT162b1/BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines have been introduced to the world and early studies reported no safety profile against thrombotic events [1,3]. We report a rare case of internal jugular vein thrombosis (IJT) occurring who received his first dose of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine and subsequently developed clot in his internal jugular vein. CASE PRESENTATION: 38-year-old with history of opioid abuse on suboxone received his first BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine on April 18, 2021. Two days later patient experienced chest pain, dyspnea, left neck swelling and dry cough with odynophagia. Outpatient work up with ultrasonography evaluation revealed a clot and was referred for further evaluation. Carotid US confirmed noncompressible internal jugular vein and CT chest demonstrated left innominate vein thrombus. Laboratory work was notable for elevated PT, PTT, leukocytosis, thrombophilia, elevated LDH and D-Dimer. Intranasal PCR was negative for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. Malignancy workup during hospital admission was negative. DISCUSSION: mRNA vaccines have been reported as a safe and efficacious new type of vaccine to combat SARS-CoV-19. Until recently, no thrombotic events were reported from any BNT162b1/ BNT162b2 mRNA vaccines [2]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of a rare blood clot seen after the first dose of any mRNA vaccine. Given our patient's symptom onset within 1 week of his first dose with documented thrombus and elevated inflammatory markers and in the absence of comorbid conditions, we hypothesize that BNT162b2 likely triggered an extreme immune inflammatory response culminating in our patient's IJT. Patient only received 1 dose of the vaccine but response to the vaccine varies by individual. Careful monitoring of patients for post-vaccine is appropriate given the lack of long-term safety profile. This report will hopefully provide some insight into a potential complication of the newly developed mRNA vaccine that was not discovered during the initial investigative studies. CONCLUSIONS: The adenovirus SARS-CoV-2 vaccine recently became associated with pathologic thrombosis and, although rare, thrombosis may also be a complication of the mRNA vaccines. Close monitoring and possible prophylactic treatment may be considered in patients receiving these vaccines who are at high risk for thrombosis.

Methods Daily COVID-19 incidence reported between 3/16/2020-12/31/2020 was the outcome. Average windspeed and maximal daily temperature were derived from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Negative binomial regression was used to model incidence, adjusting for susceptible population size. Results Cases were very high in the initial wave but diminished quickly once lockdown procedures were enacted. Unadjusted and multivariable-adjusted analyses revealed that warmer days with windspeed <5.5 MPH had increased COVID-19 incidence (aIRR=1.50, 95% C.I.=[1.25-1.81], P<0.001) as compared to days with average windspeed [≥]5.5 MPH. Conclusion This study suggests that outdoor transmission of COVID-19 may occur by noting that the risk of transmission of COVID-19 in the summer was highest on days when wind was reduced.","Clouston, S.; Morozova, O.; Meliker, J.",,190,1

However, beyond their protective function, antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 may also participate in disease pathogenesis. To explore the potential relationship between virus-specific humoral responses and COVID-19 immunopathology, we measured serum antibody classes and subclasses to the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the nucleoprotein in a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with moderate to severe disease. We found that RBD-specific IgG1 and IgG3 dominated the humoral response to SARS-CoV-2, were more abundant in severe patients, and positively correlated with several clinical parameters of inflammation. In contrast, a virus-specific IgA2 response skewed toward RBD rather than NP associated with a more favorable clinical course. Interestingly, RBD-dominant IgA2 responses were mostly detected in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms, suggesting the possible involvement of intrinsically tolerogenic gut immune pathways in the attenuation of virus-induced inflammation and disease resolution.","De Campos Mata, L.; Pinero, J.; Tejedor Vaquero, S.; Tacho-Pinot, R.; Kuksin, M.; Arrieta Aldea, I.; Rodrigo Melero, N.; Carolis, C.; Furlong, L.; Cerutti, A.; Villar-Garcia, J.; Magri, G.",,190,21

Absent repeated representative viral test samples in the population, public health officials and researchers alike have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. Recently researchers have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in municipal sewage sludge with measured RNA concentrations rising and falling suggestively in the shape of an epidemic curve while providing an earlier signal of infection than hospital admissions data. The present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model. The results demonstrate that both data series plausibly follow from the transmission model specified and provide a 95% confidence interval estimate of the reproductive number R(0) ≈ 2.4 ± 0.2. Sensitivity analysis accounting for alternative lag distributions from infection until hospitalization and sludge RNA concentration respectively suggests that the detection of viral RNA in sewage sludge leads hospital admissions by 3 to 5 days on average. The analysis suggests that stay-at-home restrictions plausibly removed 89% of the population from the risk of infection with the remaining 11% exposed to an unmitigated outbreak that infected 9.3% of the total population.","Kaplan, Edward H.; Wang, Dennis; Wang, Mike; Malik, Amyn A.; Zulli, Alessandro; Peccia, Jordan",Health Care Manag Sci,190,5

To understand the continuing spread of the virus, to detect those who are and were infected, and to follow the immune response longitudinally, reliable and robust assays for SARS‐CoV‐2 detection and immunological monitoring are needed. We quantified IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies recognizing the SARS‐CoV‐2 receptor‐binding domain (RBD) or the Spike (S) protein over a period of 6 months following COVID‐19 onset. We report the detailed setup to monitor the humoral immune response from over 300 COVID‐19 hospital patients and healthcare workers, 2500 University staff, and 198 post‐COVID‐19 volunteers. Anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 antibody responses follow a classic pattern with a rapid increase within the first three weeks after symptoms. Although titres reduce subsequently, the ability to detect anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG antibodies remained robust with confirmed neutralization activity for up to 6 months in a large proportion of previously virus‐positive screened subjects. Our work provides detailed information for the assays used, facilitating further and longitudinal analysis of protective immunity to SARS‐CoV‐2. Importantly, it highlights a continued level of circulating neutralising antibodies in most people with confirmed SARS‐CoV‐2.","Figueiredo‐Campos, Patrícia; Blankenhaus, Birte; Mota, Catarina; Gomes, Andreia; Serrano, Marta; Ariotti, Silvia; Costa, Catarina; Nunes‐Cabaço, Helena; Mendes, António M.; Gaspar, Pedro; Pereira‐Santos, M.

Aims of this narrative review were to summarize the basic concepts of ML applied to clinical medicine and explore its main applications in the emergency department (ED) setting, with a particular focus on syncope management. Through an extensive literature search in PubMed and Embase, we found increasing evidence suggesting that the use of ML algorithms can improve ED triage, diagnosis, and risk stratification of many diseases. However, the lacks of external validation and reliable diagnostic standards currently limit their implementation in clinical practice. Syncope represents a challenging problem for the emergency physician both because its diagnosis is not supported by specific tests and the available prognostic tools proved to be inefficient. ML algorithms have the potential to overcome these limitations and, in the future, they could support the clinician in managing syncope patients more efficiently. However, at present only few studies have addressed this issue, albeit with encouraging results.","Dipaola, Franca; Shiffer, Dana; Gatti, Mauro; Menè, Roberto; Solbiati, Monica; Furlan, Raffaello",Medicina (Kaunas),190,16

Although some diseases have increased as the climate has warmed, evidence for widespread climate-driven disease expansion has not materialized, despite increased research attention. Biological responses to warming depend on the non-linear relationships between physiological performance and temperature, called the thermal response curve. This leads performance to rise and fall with temperature. Under climate change, host species and their associated parasites face extinction if they cannot either thermoregulate or adapt by shifting phenology or geographic range. Climate change might also affect disease transmission through increases or decreases in host susceptibility and infective stage (and vector) production, longevity, and pathology. Many other factors drive disease transmission, especially economics, and some change in time along with temperature, making it hard to distinguish whether temperature drives disease or just correlates with disease drivers. Although it is difficult to predict how climate change will affect infectious disease, an ecological approach can help meet the challenge.","Lafferty, Kevin D.; Mordecai, Erin A.",F1000Res,190,32

We have assessed the performance of serum apolipoprotein-A1, the main transporter of HDL-cholesterol, to identify the early spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) in the general population and its diagnostic performance for the Covid-19. Methods We compared the daily mean serum apolipoprotein-A1 during the first 34 weeks of 2020 in a population that is routinely followed for a risk of liver fibrosis risk in the USA (212,297 sera) and in France (20,652 sera) in relation to a local increase in confirmed cases, and in comparison to the same period in 2019 (266,976 and 28,452 sera, respectively). We prospectively assessed the sensitivity of this marker in an observational study of 136 consecutive hospitalized cases and retrospectively evaluated its specificity in 7,481 controls representing the general population. Results The mean serum apolipoprotein-A1 levels in the survey populations began decreasing in January 2020, compared to the same period in 2019. This decrease was highly correlated with the daily increase in confirmed Covid-19 cases in the following 34 weeks, both in France and USA, including the June and mid-July recovery periods in France. Apolipoprotein-A1 at the 1.25 g/L cutoff had a sensitivity of 90.6% (95%CI84.2-95.1) and a specificity of 96.1% (95.7-96.6%) for the diagnosis of Covid-19. The area under the characteristics curve was 0.978 (0.957-0.988), and outperformed haptoglobin and liver function tests. The adjusted risk ratio of apolipoprotein-A1 for survival without transfer to intensive care unit was 5.61 (95%CI 1.02-31.0;P=0.04).

OBJECTIVE: Design and validate a real‐time reverse‐transcriptase PCR (rt RT‐PCR) assay for the detection of influenza C. STUDY DESIGN: Respiratory samples from two primary settings, namely, children who were hospitalized or seen in the emergency department, and respiratory outbreaks for which no other viral etiology was found were used for the detection of influenza C. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The assay was sensitive and specific for the detection of influenza C. Eleven of 474 (2·32%) patients, all less than 10 years of age, were positive for influenza C. The strains clustered into two lineages, namely C/Kanagawa and C/Sao Paulo, based upon sequencing of the hemagglutinin‐esterase gene.

The effectiveness of the BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccines against this variant has been unclear. METHODS: We used a test-negative case–control design to estimate the effectiveness of vaccination against symptomatic disease caused by the delta variant or the predominant strain (B.1.1.7, or alpha variant) over the period that the delta variant began circulating. Variants were identified with the use of sequencing and on the basis of the spike (S) gene status. Data on all symptomatic sequenced cases of Covid-19 in England were used to estimate the proportion of cases with either variant according to the patients’ vaccination status. RESULTS: Effectiveness after one dose of vaccine (BNT162b2 or ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) was notably lower among persons with the delta variant (30.7%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 25.2 to 35.7) than among those with the alpha variant (48.7%; 95% CI, 45.5 to 51.7); the results were similar for both vaccines. With the BNT162b2 vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 93.7% (95% CI, 91.6 to 95.3) among persons with the alpha variant and 88.0% (95% CI, 85.3 to 90.1) among those with the delta variant. With the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, the effectiveness of two doses was 74.5% (95% CI, 68.4 to 79.4) among persons with the alpha variant and 67.0% (95% CI, 61.3 to 71.8) among those with the delta variant. CONCLUSIONS: Only modest differences in vaccine effectiveness were noted with the delta variant as compared with the alpha variant after the receipt of two vaccine doses. Absolute differences in vaccine effectiveness were more marked after the receipt of the first dose. This finding would support efforts to maximize vaccine uptake with two doses among vulnerable populations.

Altogether, 201 healthy adults (age range, 18–50) mostly from North America and the British Isles were recruited to this study via the crowdsourcing site www.prolific.co. The results showed that higher levels of COVID-19-related anxiety during the first weeks of the pandemic outbreak were associated with poorer WM performance as measured by the n-back paradigm. Critically, the unique role of COVID-19-related anxiety on WM could not be explained by demographic factors, or other psychological factors such as state and trait anxiety or fluid intelligence. Moreover, across three assessment points spanning 5–6 weeks, COVID-19-related anxiety levels tended to decrease over time. This pattern of results may reflect an initial psychological “shock wave” of the pandemic, the cognitive effects of which may linger for some time, albeit the initial anxiety associated with the pandemic would change with habituation and increasing information.

Consequently, holding online exams with sufficient reliability and effectiveness became one of the most critical and challenging subjects in higher education. Therefore, it is essential to have a preventive algorithm to allocate time and financial resources effectively. In the present study, a fair test with sufficient validity is first defined, and then by analogy with an engineering product, the design process is implemented on it. For this purpose, a hybrid method based on FMEA, which is a preventive method to identify potential failure modes and prioritize their risk, is employed. The method's output is provided to the QFD algorithm as the needs of product customers. Then, the proposed solutions to prevent failures are weighted and prioritized as the product's technical features. Some modifications are made to the classic form of FMEA in the proposed method to eliminate its deficiencies and contradictions. Therefore, our proposed algorithm is a precautionary approach that works to prevent breakdowns instead of fixing them following their occurrence. This issue is very effective in increasing the efficiency of activities in times of crisis. Eventually, a prioritized list of preventive actions is provided, allowing us to choose from available solutions in the circumstances with limited time and budgetary, where we cannot take all possible actions.","Gorgani, Hamid Haghshenas; Shabani, Sharif",SN Appl Sci,190,26

As periods of economic and emotional burden have proven to detrimentally affect people’s psychological health, healthcare officials warned that the strict measures could have a serious impact on psychological health, leading to an increase in suicide attempts. Thus, the objective was to provide evidence for this assumption. METHODS: All adult patients admitted to the trauma resuscitation room of the Medical University of Vienna during the lockdown period following a suicide attempt were included in this analysis, forming the study group. Suicidal patients treated during the same period in 2015, 2016, 2018, and 2019 were pooled to create the control group. The year 2017 was excluded because another major hospital in Vienna was partially closed due to a change in infrastructure, resulting in an increased number of severely injured patients treated at our department. As the lockdown caused a markedly decreased number of patients admitted due to other reasons than suicide the actual number was replaced with the average number of patients admitted in the relevant previous 4 years. RESULTS: By comparing the study and the control group based on this realistic estimate we revealed an increase in attempted suicides during the lockdown period (p = 0.001). Demographic, mental health-related, and injury specific patient data did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSION: The results strongly urge for an improvement in crisis intervention and suicide prevention measures in the event of a future lockdown.","Carlin, Greta L.; Baumgartner, Josef S.; Moftakhar, Timon; König, Daniel; Negrin, Lukas L.",Wien Klin Wochenschr,190,20

Lack of access to these types of data as well as ease of use and interpretability of scientific evidence contribute to limited uptake of evidence-informed decision-making in practice. An electronic evidence system that includes multiple sources of evidence and potentially novel computational processing approaches or artificial intelligence holds promise as a solution to overcoming barriers to evidence-informed decision-making in public health. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to understand the needs and preferences for an electronic evidence system among public health professionals in Canada. METHODS: An invitation to participate in an anonymous web-based survey was distributed via listservs of 2 Canadian public health organizations in February 2019. Eligible participants were English- or French-speaking individuals currently working in public health. The survey contained both multiple-choice and open-ended questions about the needs and preferences relevant to an electronic evidence system. Quantitative responses were analyzed to explore differences by public health role. Inductive and deductive analysis methods were used to code and interpret the qualitative data. Ethics review was not required by the host institution. RESULTS: Respondents (N=371) were heterogeneous, spanning organizations, positions, and areas of practice within public health. Nearly all (364/371, 98.1%) respondents indicated that an electronic evidence system would support their work. Respondents had high preferences for local contextual data, research and intervention evidence, and information about human and financial resources. Qualitative analyses identified several concerns, needs, and suggestions for the development of such a system. Concerns ranged from the personal use of such a system to the ability of their organization to use such a system. Recognized needs spanned the different sources of evidence, including local context, research and intervention evidence, and resources and tools. Additional suggestions were identified to improve system usability. CONCLUSIONS: Canadian public health professionals have positive perceptions toward an electronic evidence system that would bring together evidence from the local context, scientific research, and resources.

Unlike other recently published studies, where patient-cohort included a more morbid group and cancer surgeries, we report on a group of patients who had limb surgery and were more akin to elective orthopaedic surgery. METHODS: The study included 214 patients who underwent orthopaedic trauma surgeries in the hospital between 12th March and 12th May-2020 when the pandemic was on the rise in the United Kingdom. Data was collected on demographic profile including comorbidities, ASA grade, COVID-19 testing, type of procedures and any readmissions, complications or mortality due to COVID-19. RESULTS: There were 7.9% readmissions and 52.9% of it was for respiratory complications. Only one patient had positive COVID-19 test during readmission. 30-day mortality for trauma surgeries was 0% if hip fractures were excluded and 2.8% in all patients. All the mortalities were for proximal femur fracture surgeries and between ASA Grade 3 and 4 or in patients above the age of 70 years. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that presence of COVID-19 virus in the community and hospital did not adversely affect the outcome of orthopaedic trauma surgeries or lead to excess mortality or readmissions in patients undergoing limb trauma surgery. The findings also support resumption of elective orthopaedic surgeries with appropriate risk stratification, patient optimization and with adequate infrastructural support amidst the recovery phase of the pandemic.","De, Chiranjit; Kainth, Nimrath; Harbham, Pratap Karavadra; Brooks, Margaret; Agarwal, Sujit",J Clin Orthop Trauma,190,22

During biological nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), high N(2)O fluxes to the atmosphere can occur, typically exhibiting a seasonal emission pattern. Attempts to explain the peak emission phases in winter and spring using physico-chemical process data from WWTP were so far unsuccessful and new approaches are required. The complex and diverse microbial community of activated sludge used in biological treatment systems also exhibit substantial seasonal patterns. However, a potentially causal link between the seasonal patterns of microbial diversity and N(2)O emissions has not yet been investigated. Here we show that in a full-scale WWTP nitrification failure and N(2)O peak emissions, bad settleability of the activated sludge and a turbid effluent strongly correlate with a significant reduction in the microbial community diversity and shifts in community composition. During episodes of impaired performance, we observed a significant reduction in abundance for filamentous and nitrite oxidizing bacteria in all affected reactors. In some reactors that did not exhibit nitrification and settling failures, we observed a stable microbial community and no drastic loss of species. Standard engineering approaches to stabilize nitrification, such as increasing the aerobic sludge age and oxygen availability failed to improve the plant performance on this particular WWTP and replacing the activated sludge was the only measure applied by the operators to recover treatment performance in affected reactors. Our results demonstrate that disturbances of the sludge microbiome affect key structural and functional microbial groups, which lead to seasonal N(2)O emission patterns. To reduce N(2)O emissions from WWTP, it is therefore crucial to understand the drivers that lead to the microbial population dynamics in the activated sludge.","Gruber, Wenzel; Niederdorfer, Robert; Ringwald, Jörg; Morgenroth, Eberhard; Bürgmann, Helmut; Joss, Adriano",Water Res X,190,21

The COVID-19 pandemic made this process even more challenging by requiring many instructors to shift rapidly from in-person to online instruction while maintaining academic integrity. The objective of this course on tissue engineering, a multidisciplinary field that aims to repair and/or replace body damage, was to increase undergraduate students’ ability to read primary scientific literature and use critical analysis to creatively solve problems. Every week, a lecture covered the necessary background information to identify the current research questions and prepare students for reading the assigned research article. Students completed an analysis worksheet prior to the subsequent class, and a summary presentation followed by a student-led critical analysis discussion occurred in class. Small student groups completed an in-class thought exercise that designed several experiments that built on the article’s data. The modular course design enabled a quick and successful transition to an online asynchronous modality in less than two weeks due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A recorded weekly lecture was posted online by the instructor, and students completed the analysis worksheet, watched a student-recorded summary presentation, and posted to a discussion board. The experimental design worksheet became an individual assignment to provide more flexibility. Pretransition and posttransition assessment showed no significant differences and provided positive proof of concept evidence. This process can be adapted to a number of topic-themed scientific courses that use in-person, online, or hybrid modalities.","Fischer, Kristin M.",J Microbiol Biol Educ,190,24

Health planners are seeking ways to forecast the evolution of the pandemic. In this study, a mathematical model was proposed for Saudi Arabia, the country with the highest reported number of COVID-19 cases in the Arab world. METHODOLOGY The proposed model was adapted from the model used for the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in South Korea. Using time-dependent parameters, the model incorporated the effects of both population-wide self-protective measures and government actions. Data before and after the government imposed control policies on 3 March 2020 were used to validate the model. Predictions for the disease's progression were provided together with the evaluation of the effectiveness of the mitigation measures implemented by the government and self-protective measures taken by the population. RESULTS The model predicted that, if the government had continued to implement its strong control measures, then the scale of the pandemic would have decreased by 99% by the end of June 2020. Under the current relaxed policies, the model predicted that the scale of the pandemic will have decreased by 99% by 10 August 2020. The error between the model's predictions and actual data was less than 6.5%. CONCLUSIONS Although the proposed model did not capture all of the effects of human behaviors and government actions, it was validated as a result of its time-dependent parameters. The model's accuracy indicates that it can be used by public health policymakers.","Ajbar, Abdelhamid Mohamed; Ali, Emad; Ajbar, Aymane",Journal of infection in developing countries,190,2

Thus, COVID-19s daily increasing cases and deaths have led to worldwide lockdown, quarantine and some restrictions. Covid-19 epidemic in Italy started as a small wave of 2 infected cases on January 31. It was followed by a bigger wave mainly from local transmissions reported in 6387 cases on March 8. It caused the government to impose a lockdown on 8 March to the whole country as a way to suppress the pandemic. This study aims to evaluate the impact of the lockdown and awareness dynamics on infection in Italy over the period of January 31 to July 17 and how the impact varies across different lockdown scenarios in both periods before and after implementation of the lockdown policy. The findings SEIR reveal that implementation lockdown has minimised the social distancing flattening the curve. The infections associated with COVID-19 decreases with quarantine initially then easing lockdown will not cause further increasing transmission until a certain period which is explained by public high awareness. Completely removing lockdown may lead to sharp transmission second wave. Policy implementation and limitation of the study were evaluated at the end of the paper.

However, during challenging times when the medical community is in dire need of information, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, it becomes more urgent to use digital platforms that can rapidly collect data on large numbers of patients. In the current manuscript, we describe a novel digital rheumatology research platform, consisting of almost 5000 patients with autoimmune diseases and healthy controls, that was set up rapidly during the COVID-19 pandemic, but which is sustainable for the future. Using this platform, uniform patient data can be collected via questionnaires and stored in a single database readily available for analysis. In addition, the platform facilitates two-way communication between patients and researchers, so patients become true research partners. Furthermore, blood collection via a finger prick for routine and specific laboratory measurements has been implemented in this large cohort of patients, which may not only be applicable for research settings but also for clinical care. Finally, we discuss the challenges and potential future applications of our platform, including supplying tailored information to selected patient groups and facilitation of patient recruitment for clinical trials.

Among a wide range of complications in Sanjad–Sakati syndrome patients is the vulnerability to infections and subsequent hypophosphataemia. Hypophosphataemia is a metabolic alteration that contributes to numerous consequences such as cardiac arrhythmia. Therefore, if hypophosphataemia is left unresolved, it may culminate in death. A 20-month-old boy of 2.5 kg body weight diagnosed with Sanjad–Sakati syndrome was initially admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit after recovering from COVID-19, and then shifted to the general ward. He was diagnosed with recurrent pneumonia and urinary tract infection. After 9 days, the patient showed severe hypophosphataemia with serum phosphate concentration reaching 0.33 mmol/L. Despite the availability of potassium phosphate intravenous solution, it was difficult to administer potassium phosphate intravenously because of the small body size and low body weight of the patient. Therefore, 0.6 mL potassium phosphate containing 2.4 mEq of potassium and 5.3 mEq of phosphate was administered through a nasogastric tube. The patient showed rapid response after a single dose through the nasogastric tube. Such an intervention in Sanjad–Sakati syndrome patients shows possible advantages of shifting drug administration from intravenous to oral route that includes a convenient route of administration, whether in the intensive care unit or in the general ward. Moreover, shifting drug administration from the intravenous to oral route overcomes the risk of cannula-induced infection and reduces nurses’ workload.","Sabti, Mnaff A; Shamsaldeen, Yousif A",SAGE Open Med Case Rep,190,24

The detection of seropositive stray cats in the proximity of farms of infected minks, coupled with the demonstration of cat‐to‐cat transmission in experimental settings, raise the question whether stray cats may have an epidemiological role in the COVID‐19 pandemic and may act as sentinel for the circulation of SARS‐CoV‐2. The aim of this study was to evaluate the presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA and anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 antibodies in free roaming cats belonging to colonies located in an area highly affected by the COVID‐19 pandemic and to correlate the results with the positivity rate in people sharing the same area. Interdigital, cutaneous, oropharyngeal, nasal and rectal swabs, as well as blood samples, were collected from 99 cats living in colonies and admitted to our hospital for neutering. This caseload corresponds to the 24.2% of the feline population living in the 25 sampled colonies and to the 5.6% of all the free‐roaming registered cats. The presence of SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA in swabs was assessed using real time RT‐PCR. Anti‐SARS‐CoV‐2 serum antibodies were assessed using commercially available ELISA kits and confirmed by serum virus neutralization. In people, the SARS‐CoV‐2 positivity rate ranged from 3.0% to 5.1% (mean rate: 4.1%) and the seropositive rate from 12.1% to 16.3% (mean rate: 14.2%). Most of the colonies were in urban areas and resident cats had frequent contacts with external cats or people. A COVID‐19 positive caretaker was found, whereas all the cats were negative for SARS‐CoV‐2 RNA and seronegative. Although the negative results cannot exclude previous infections followed by decrease of antibodies, this study suggests that colony cats do not have an important epidemiological role in SARS‐CoV‐2 transmission dynamics. Further studies on larger caseloads are warranted, also in the light of the emerging new viral variants, on a One Health perspective.","Stranieri, Angelica; Lauzi, Stefania; Giordano, Alessia; Galimberti, Luigi; Ratti, Gabriele; Decaro, Nicola; Brioschi, Federica; Lelli, Davide; Gabba, Silvia; Amarachi, Ndiana Linda; Lorusso, Eleonora; Moreno, Ana; Trogu, Tiziana; Paltrinieri, Saverio",Transbound Emerg Dis,190,10

Physiologically, VN stimulation can rapidly affect cardiac activity and heart rate (HR). VN neuropathy can increase the risk of arrhythmias and sudden death. Therefore, a selective test of VN function may be very useful. Since peripheral neurodynamic tests (NDT) are reliable for the assessment of neuropathies in somatic nerves, we aimed to validate a novel NDT to assess VN activity, namely, the VN-NTD. METHODS: In this cross-sectional double-blind, sex-balanced study, 30 participants (15 females) completed a checklist of autonomic dysfunction symptoms. During the VN-NDT administration, HR and symptoms (i.e., mechanical allodynia) were monitored in parallel to a real-time ultrasonography imaging (USI) and motion capture analysis of the neck. The VN-NDT impact on HR and its accuracy for autonomic symptoms reported in the last 7 days were tested. RESULTS: The VN-NDT induced a significant HR reduction of about 12 and 8 bpm in males and females [t(1, 119) = 2.425; p < 0.017; η(p)(2) = 0.047, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93–9.18], respectively. No adverse events were observed during VN-NDT. A substantial interexaminer agreement between the evaluators in symptoms induction by VN-NDT was detected [F(1, 119) = 0.540; p = 0.464; η(p)(2) = 0.005, low effect]. Notably, mechanical allodynia accuracy for gastrointestinal dysfunctions was excellent (p < 0.05; 95% CI: 0.52–0.73; p < 0.001; 95% CI: 0.81–0.96). CONCLUSIONS: The novel VN-NDT is a valid and accurate test capable of detecting VN activation with high sensitivity. Data provided are suitable for both sexes as a hallmark of HR variation due to VN normal response. The proposed VN-NDT may be reliable as daily routine neurological examination tests for the evaluation of neuropathic signs related to neuroinflammation of the VN.

Post-traumatic growth (PTG) has been defined as the subjective experience of positive psychological changes as a result of a traumatic event. PTG can involve changes in five psychological main dimensions: relating to others, new possibilities, personal strength, spiritual change, and appreciation of life. In the context of national emergencies, those PTG dimensions encompassing changes at the social level (e.g., relating to others) can play a role in coping strategies that involve a renewed sense of self and one’s social identities, including national identities, and in turn, foster a stronger sense of trust and connection to others. AIM: To investigate how each of the five PTG dimensions mediates the association between the salience of national identity and interpersonal trust in a sample of Italian young adults. Trust in national and European institutions were expected to positively predict the strength of the Italian national identity which in turn was expected to be positively associated with interpersonal trust, and the PTG relating to others dimension to mediate this association. METHOD: This study involves the secondary analysis of data from a representative sample of 2,000 Italian young adults (age range 18–34 years). Participants completed a web survey during the peak of the COVID-19 crisis in Italy with measures of trust in EU and national institutions, national identity, interpersonal trust, and the PTG Inventory. Structural equation modeling procedures were employed for key hypotheses tests. RESULTS: Trust in national institutions positively predicted national identity, which in turn was positively associated with interpersonal trust. Evidence of a full mediation effect of the PTG relating to others dimension on the association between national identity and interpersonal trust was found. DISCUSSION: Findings contribute to clarify the psychological responses to collective traumas. In the context of Italy’s COVID-19 crisis, trust in national institutions reinforced Italian national identity, which was in turn associated with greater interpersonal trust, but only when psychological responses to the trauma involved changes in how individuals perceived and related to others, and not merely a focus on the self. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.","Ellena, Adriano Mauro; Aresi, Giovanni; Marta, Elena; Pozzi, Maura",Front Psychol,190,3

Here, we reveal sequences of the virus isolated from three different patients with various clinical presentations. METHODS: Nasopharyngeal swab specimens of the patients were tested positive for the COVID-19 by qRT-PCR. Viral RNA extraction was performed from the same swab samples. Amplicon based libraries were prepared and sequenced using the Illumina NextSeq platform. Raw sequencing data were processed for variant calling and generating near-complete genome sequences. All three genomes were evaluated and compared with other worldwide isolates. RESULTS: The patients showed various clinics (an asymptomatic patient, patient with mild disease, and with severe pulmonary infiltration). Amplicon-based next-generation sequencing approach successfully applied to generate near-complete genomes with an average depth of 2.616. All three viral genomes carried the D614G variant (G clade according to GISAID classification) with implications for the origin of a spread first through China to Europe then to Istanbul. CONCLUSION: Here, we report the viral genomes circulating in Istanbul for the first time. Further sequencing of the virus isolates may enable us to understand variations in disease presentation and association with viral factors if there is any. In addition, the sequencing of more viral genomes will delineate the spread of disease and will guide and ease the necessary measures taken to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus.","Karacan, Ilker; Akgun, Tugba Kizilboga; Agaoglu, N.

We make a case for provisioning COVID-19 tests through the United States Postal Service (USPS) facilities and demonstrate a simple method for selecting locations to improve access. We provide quantitative evidence that even a subset of USPS facilities could provide broad access, particularly in remote and at-risk communities with limited access to health care. Based on daily travel surveys, census data, locations of USPS facilities, and an established care-seeking model, we estimate that more than 94% of the US population would be willing to travel to an existing USPS facility if warranted. For half of the US population, this would require traveling less than 2.5 miles from home; for 90%, the distance would be less than 7 miles. In Georgia, Illinois, and Minnesota, we estimate that testing at USPS facilities would provide access to an additional 4.1, 3.1, and 1.3 million people and reduce the median travel distance by 3.0, 0.8, and 1.2 miles, respectively, compared with existing testing sites per 28 July 2020.

Many countries of the world, including India, closed their borders and imposed a nationwide lockdown. In India, the lockdown was declared on March 24 for 21 days (March 25–April 14, 2020) and was later extended until May 3, 2020. During the lockdown, all major anthropogenic activities, which contribute to atmospheric pollution (such as industries, vehicles, and businesses), were restricted. The current study examines the impact of the lockdown on tropospheric NO(2) concentrations. Satellite-based ozone monitoring instrument sensor data were analyzed in order to investigate the variations in tropospheric NO(2) concentrations. The results showed that from March 1 to 21, 2020, the average tropospheric NO(2) concentration was 214.4 ×10(13) molecule cm(-2) over India, and it subsequently decreased by 12.1% over the next four weeks. An increase of 0.8% in tropospheric NO(2) concentrations was observed for the same period in 2019 and hence, the reduced tropospheric NO(2) concentrations can be attributed to restricted anthropogenic activities during the lockdown. In the absence of significant activities, the contribution of various sources was estimated, and the emissions from biomass burning were identified as a major source of tropospheric NO(2) during the lockdown. The findings of this study provide an opportunity to understand the mechanism of tropospheric NO(2) emissions over India, in order to improve air quality modeling and management strategies.","Biswal, Akash; Singh, Tanbir; Singh, Vikas; Ravindra, Khaiwal; Mor, Suman",Heliyon,190,10

The timing and nature of the COVID-19 pandemic response and control varied among the regions and from one country to the other, and their role in affecting the spread of the disease has been debated. The focus of this work is on the early phase of the disease when control measures can be most effective. We proposed a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed model (SEIR) model based on temporal moving windows to quantify COVID-19 transmission patterns and compare the temporal progress of disease spread in six representative regions worldwide: three Chinese regions (Zhejiang, Guangdong and Xinjiang) vs. three countries (South Korea, Italy and Iran). It was found that in the early phase of COVID-19 spread the disease follows a certain empirical law that is common in all regions considered. Simulations of the imposition of strong social distancing measures were used to evaluate the impact that these measures might have had on the duration and severity of COVID-19 outbreaks in the three countries. Measure-dependent transmission rates followed a modified normal distribution (empirical law) in the three Chinese regions. These rates responded quickly to the launch of the 1(st)-level Response to Major Public Health Emergency in each region, peaking after 1–2 days, reaching their inflection points after 10–19 days, and dropping to zero after 11–18 days since the 1(st)-level response was launched. By March 29(th), the mortality rates were 0.08% (Zhejiang), 0.54% (Guangdong) and 3.95% (Xinjiang). Subsequent modeling simulations were based on the working assumption that similar infection transmission control measures were taken in South Korea as in Zhejiang on February 25(th), in Italy as in Guangdong on February 25(th), and in Iran as in Xinjiang on March 8(th). The results showed that by June 15(th) the accumulated infection cases could have been reduced by 32.49% (South Korea), 98.16% (Italy) and 85.73% (Iran). The surface air temperature showed stronger association with transmission rate of COVID-19 than surface relative humidity. On the basis of these findings, disease control measures were shown to be particularly effective in flattening and shrinking the COVID-10 case curve, which could effectively reduce the severity of the disease and mitigate medical burden. The proposed empirical law and the SEIR-temporal moving window model can also be used to study infectious disease outbreaks worldwide.","He, Junyu; Chen, Guangwei; Jiang, Yutong; Jin, Runjie; Shortridge, Ashton; Agusti, Susana; He, Mingjun; Wu, Jiaping; Duarte, Carlos M.; Christakos, George",Sci Total Environ,190,14

In a large cohort study Dengvaxia was found to partially protect children who had prior dengue virus (DENV) infections but sensitized seronegative children to breakthrough DENV disease of enhanced severity. In 2019, the European Medicines Agency and the US FDA issued licenses that reconciled safety issues by restricting vaccine to individuals with prior dengue infections. Using revised Dengvaxia efficacy and safety data we sought to estimate hospitalized and severe dengue cases among the more than 800,000 9 year-old children vaccinated in the Philippines. Despite an overall vaccine efficacy of 69% during 4 years post-vaccination we project there will be more than one thousand vaccinated seronegative and seropositive children hospitalized for severe dengue.

Clinical responses observed during breakthrough dengue infections in vaccinated individuals counsel prudence in design of vaccine policies. Recommendations concerning continued use of this dengue vaccine are: (1) obtain a better definition of vaccine efficacy and safety through enhanced phase 4 surveillance, (2) obtain a valid, accessible, sensitive, specific and affordable serological test that identifies past wild-type dengue virus infection and (3) clarify safety and efficacy of Dengvaxia in flavivirus immunes. In the absence of an acceptable serological screening test these unresolved ethical issues suggest Dengvaxia be given only to those signing informed consent.","Halstead, Scott B.; Katzelnick, Leah C.; Russell, Philip K.; Markoff, Lewis; Aguiar, Maira; Dans, Leonila R.; Dans, Antonio L.",Vaccine,190,5

Exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic, provider well-being has become a critical issue for health care systems worldwide. We describe the prevalence and key system-level drivers of burnout in oncologists in Ontario, Canada. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional survey study conducted in November-December 2019 of practicing cancer care physicians (surgical, medical, radiation, gynecologic oncology, and hematology) in Ontario, Canada. Ontario is Canada's largest province (with a population of 14.5 million), and has a single-payer publicly funded cancer system. The primary outcome was burnout experience assessed through the Maslach Burnout Inventory. RESULTS: A total of 418 physicians completed the questionnaire (response rate was 44% among confirmed oncologists). Seventy-three percent (n = 264 of 362) of oncologists had symptoms of burnout (high emotional exhaustion and/or depersonalization scores). Significant drivers of burnout identified in multivariable regression modeling included working in a hectic or chaotic atmosphere (odds ratio [OR] = 15.5; 95% CI, 3.4 to 71.5; P < .001), feeling unappreciated on the job (OR = 7.9; 95% CI, 2.9 to 21.3; P < .001), reporting poor or marginal control over workload (OR = 7.9; 95% CI, 2.9 to 21.3; P < .001), and not being comfortable talking to peers about workplace stress (OR = 3.0; 95% CI, 1.1 to 7.9; P < .001). Older age (≥ 56 years) was associated with lower odds of burnout (OR = 0.16; 95% CI, 0.1 to 0.4; P < .001). CONCLUSION: Nearly three quarters of participants met predefined standardized criteria for burnout. This number is striking, given the known impact of burnout on provider mental health, patient safety, and quality of care, and suggests Oncologists in Ontario may be a vulnerable group that warrants attention. Health care changes being driven by the COVID-19 pandemic provide an opportunity to rebuild new systems that address drivers of burnout. Creating richer peer-to-peer and leadership engagement opportunities among early- to mid-career individuals may be a worthwhile organizational strategy.","Singh, Simron; Farrelly, Ashley; Chan, Catherine; Nicholls, Brett; Nazeri-Rad, Narges; Bellicoso, Daniela; Eisen, Andrea; Falkson, Conrad B; Fox, Colleen; Holloway, Claire; Kennedy, Erin; McLeod, Robin; Rothenberger, David; Trudeau, Maureen; Shanafelt, Tait; Bauman, Glenn",JCO Oncol Pract,190,1

Our study aimed to identify an association between survival and specific antibodies found in CCP. Patients and Methods Patients >18 years of age who were hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 infection and received CCP at the MD Anderson Cancer Center between 4/30/2020 and 8/20/2020 were included in the study. We quantified the levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, as well as antibodies against antigens of other coronavirus strains, in the CCP units and compared antibody levels with patient outcomes. For each antibody, a Bayesian exponential survival time regression model including prognostic variables was fit, and the posterior probability of a beneficial effect (PBE) of higher antibody level on survival time was computed. Results CCP was administered to 44 cancer patients. The median age was 60 years (range 37-84) and 19 (43%) were female. Twelve patients (27%) died of COVID-19-related complications. Higher levels of two non-SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, anti-HCoV-OC43 spike IgG and anti-HCoV-HKU1 spike IgG, had PBE = 1.00, and 4 SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies had PBEs between 0.90 and 0.95. Other factors associated with better survival were shorter time to CCP administration, younger age, and female sex. Conclusions Common cold coronavirus spike IgG antibodies anti-HCoV-OC43 and anti-HCoV-HKU1 may target a common domain for SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses.

We propose novel descriptors based on a COSMO-RS (short for conductor-like screening model for real solvents) σ-profiles for enhanced drug screening enabled by machine learning (ML). The descriptors’ performance is hereby illustrated for nucleotide analogue drugs that inhibit the ribonucleic acid-dependent ribonucleic acid polymerase, key to viral transcription and genome replication. The COSMO-RS-based descriptors account for both chemical reactivity and structure, and are more effective for ML-based screening than fingerprints based on molecular structure and simple physical/chemical properties. The descriptors are evaluated using principal component analysis, an unsupervised ML technique. Our results correlate with the active monophosphate forms of the leading drug remdesivir and the prospective drug EIDD-2801 with nucleotides, followed by other promising drugs, and are superior to those from molecular structure-based descriptors and molecular docking.

The immune systems of various mucosal tissues display distinctive features that reflect the tissues' anatomical and functional characteristics. This review discusses the cellular components that constitute the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts; in particular, it highlights the complex interactions between epithelial and immune cells to induce Ag-specific immune responses in the lung and gut.

ALI is partly caused by host immune responses. Under the inspiration of unsuccessful treatment in COVID-19, recent insights into pathogen–host interactions are leading to identification and development of a wide range of host-directed therapies with different mechanisms of action. The interaction unit consisting of macrophages and the alveolar epithelial cells has recently revealed as the therapeutic basis targeting ALI. Lian Hua Qing Wen capsule is the most effective and commonly-used clinical formula in treating respiratory infection for thousands of years in China. However, little is known about its relevance with ALI, especially its protective role against ALI-induced alveolar tissue damages. Aiming to evaluate its contribution in antibiotics-integrating therapies, this study pharmacologically verified whether LHQW could alleviate lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI and explore its potential mechanisms in maintaining the physiology of macrophage-epithelial unit. In ALI mouse model, the pathological parameters, including the anal temperature, inflammation condition, lung edema, histopathological structures, have all been systematically analyzed. Results consistently supported the effectiveness of the combined strategy for LHQW and low-dose antibiotics. Furthermore, we established the macrophages-alveolar epithelial cells co-culture model and firstly proved that LHQW inhibited LPS-induced ER stress and TRAIL secretion in macrophages, thereby efficiently protected epithelial cells against TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Mechanistically, results showed that LHQW significantly deactivated NF-κB and reversed the SOCS3 expression in inflammatory macrophages. Furthermore, we proved that the therapeutic effects of LHQW were highly dependent on JNK-AP1 regulation. In conclusion, our data proved that LHQW is an epithelial protector in ALI, implying its promising potential in antibiotic alternative therapy.","Li, Qi; Ran, Qingsen; Sun, Lidong; Yin, Jie; Luo, Ting; Liu, Li; Zhao, Zheng; Yang, Qing; Li, Yujie; Chen, Ying; Weng, Xiaogang; Wang, Yajie; Cai, Weiyan; Zhu, Xiaoxin",Front Pharmacol,190,20

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The authors assessed data of encounters and intravitreal injections from March 16th to May 8th 2020, at different offices specializing in retina in the United States. All three practices are located in COVID-19 hot spot zones. One practice was in an academic setting, one practice was in a private multispecialty setting, and one practice was a solo private vitreo-retina practice. All practices were focused on emergent/urgent care, and the results were compared to preCOVID-19 weekly averages. RESULTS: A significant decrease in the number of encounters and injections was revealed in all three centers involved in this review. There was a decrease of 87% in encounters (156 patients were seen only) and a decrease of 58% (126 patients) in intravitreal injections in Weill Cornell Medical College in NYC and a decline of 59% (569 patients) in encounters and a decrease of 64% (280 patients) of intravitreal injections at the Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston and Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston. The decline at Miami Ocular Oncology & Retina in Miami was 37% (1198 patients) in the encounters and 30% (867 patients) in the injections. CONCLUSION: This manuscript documents a specific example illustrating that COVID-19 has led to a significant decrease in specialized health services. The degree of infection and mortality rate at each hot spot had a direct impact on the practice volume; however, the type of practice setting also played a role.","El Hamichi, Sophia; Gold, Aaron; Heier, Jeffrey; Kiss, Szilard; Murray, Timothy G",Clin Ophthalmol,190,16

We also seek to understand the association of temperature and geographic coordinates with viral genomics. Epidemiological data along with temperature, latitude, longitude, and preparedness index were collected for different countries and US states during the early stages of the pandemic. Our worldwide epidemiological analysis showed a significant correlation between temperature and incidence, mortality, recovery cases and active cases. The same tendency was found with latitude, but not with longitude. In the US, we observed no correlation between temperature or latitude and epidemiological variables. Interestingly, longitude was correlated with incidence, mortality, active cases, and hospitalization. An analysis of mutational change and mutational change per time in 55 453 aligned SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences revealed these parameters were uncorrelated with temperature and geographic coordinates. The epidemiological trends we observed worldwide suggest a seasonal effect for the disease that is not directly controlled by the genomic makeup of the virus.

METHODS: Levels of CGRP in the serum of 57 COVID-19 patients (24 asymptomatic, 23 hospitalized in the general ward, and 10 admitted to the intensive care unit) and healthy donors (n=24) were measured by ELISA. In addition, to better understand the physiological consequences of the observed variations, we investigated by immunofluorescence the distribution of RAMP1, one of the components of the CGRP receptor, in autopsy lung specimens. RESULTS: CGRP levels greatly decreased in COVID-19 patients (p<0.001) when compared to controls, and there were no significant differences due to disease severity, sex, age, or comorbidities. We found that COVID-19 patients treated with proton pump inhibitors had lower levels of CGRP than other patients not taking this treatment (p=0.001). RAMP1 immunoreactivity was found in smooth muscle cells of large blood vessels and the bronchial tree, and in the airways epithelium. In COVID-19 samples, RAMP1 was also found in proliferating type II pneumocytes, a common finding in these patients. CONCLUSIONS: The lower levels of CGRP should negatively impact the respiratory physiology of COVID-19 patients due to vasoconstriction, improper angiogenesis, less epithelial repair, and faulty immune response. Therefore, restoring CGRP levels in these patients may represent a novel therapeutic approach for COVID-19.","Ochoa-Callejero, Laura; García-Sanmartín, Josune; Villoslada-Blanco, Pablo; Íñiguez, María; Pérez-Matute, Patricia; Pujadas, Elisabet; Fowkes, Mary E; Brody, Rachel; Oteo, José A; Martínez, Alfredo",J Endocr Soc,190,14

We speculate that the high incidence of COVID-19 cases and deaths in countries less affected by malaria is partly due to overexposure to malaria which led to the regular use of the artemisinin anti-malaria drugs as well as the regular use of bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine for TB prevention. The vaccine produced an almost life-long immunity to TB and meningitis to its recipients. We are thus calling for a COVID-19 containment and clinical management protocol that will incorporate the use of the anti-malaria ACT drug cocktail and BCG vaccine on compassionate ground.","Kangbai, Jia Bainga; Babawo, Lawrence Sao; Kaitibi, Daniel; Sandi, Anthony A.; George, Angela Magdalene; Sahr, Foday",SN Compr Clin Med,190,1

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA: All published articles of patients with CVT treated with DOAC were included. Studies without follow-up information were excluded. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent reviewers screened articles and extracted data. A risk of bias analysis was performed. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Safety data included mortality, intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) or other adverse events. Efficacy data included recurrent CVT, recanalisation rates and disability by modified Rankin Scales (mRS). RESULTS: 33 studies met inclusion criteria. One randomised controlled trial, 5 observational cohorts and 27 case series or studies reported 279 patients treated with DOAC for CVT: 41% dabigatran, 47% rivaroxaban, 10% apixaban and 2% edoxaban, in addition to 315 patients treated with standard therapy.

Medical masks have been proven to effectively block disease transmission. Radiotherapeutic departments are at unique risk for disease exposure with the repeated daily treatment schedule. A protocol of mask wearing during daily treatment was established, and the effect of wearing medical masks on dosimetry during proton beam therapy (PBT) was validated. METHODS: A department protocol of medical mask wearing was initiated after the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical masks that were made under standardized specification and regulation were obtained for analyses. The physical and dosimetric characteristics of these medical masks were measured by different proton energies using commercialized measurement tools. RESULTS: Patients and staff were able to adopt the protocol on a weekly basis, and no adverse events were reported. The average physical thickness of a single piece of medical mask was 0.5 mm with a water equivalent thickness (WET) of 0.1 mm. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that mask wearing for patients undergoing daily radiotherapy is feasible and can provide basic protection for patients and staff. The impact of mask wearing on dosimetry was only 0.1 mm in WET, which has no impact on clinical PBT treatment. A medical mask-wearing policy can be applied safely without dosimetric concerns and should be considered as a standard practice for PBT centers during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Wang, Yu-Ming; Hsieh, Yang-Wei; Huang, Bing-Shen; Sung, Kuo-Chiang; Juan, Kuo-Jung; Lee, Steve P; Lee, Shen-Hao; Huang, Eng-Yen",Risk Manag Healthc Policy,190,5

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty postlingually deafened adults with unilateral CIs (mean age 65 years, range 46–92 years) were tested with a music quality questionnaire using three passages of music from Classical Music, Jazz, and Soul. Speech recognition in noise was assessed using two newly developed adaptive tests in Italian: The Sentence Test with Adaptive Randomized Roving levels (STARR) and Matrix tests. RESULTS: Median quality ratings for Classical, Jazz and Soul music were 63%, 58% and 58%, respectively. Median SRTs for the STARR and Matrix tests were 14.3 dB and 7.6 dB, respectively. STARR performance was significantly correlated with Classical music ratings (r(s) = − 0.49, p = 0.029), whereas Matrix performance was significantly correlated with both Classical (r(s) = − 0.48, p = 0.031) and Jazz music ratings (r(s) = − 0.56, p = 0.011). CONCLUSION: Speech with competitive noise and music are naturally present in everyday listening environments. Recent speech perception tests based on an adaptive paradigm and sentence materials in relation with music quality measures might be representative of everyday performance in CI users. The present data contribute to cross-language studies and suggest that improving music perception in CI users may yield everyday benefit in speech perception in noise and may hence enhance the quality of listening for CI users.","Dincer D’Alessandro, Hilal; Boyle, Patrick J.; Portanova, Ginevra; Mancini, Patrizia",Eur Arch Otorhinolaryngol,190,14

This is the first observational study to evaluate its impact on the orthopedic workload in a London level 1 trauma center (i.e., a major trauma center [MTC]) before (2019) and during (2020) the “golden month” post-COVID-19 lockdown. Patients and methods — We performed a longitudinal observational prevalence study of both acute orthopedic trauma referrals, operative and anesthetic casemix for the first “golden” month from March 17, 2020. We compared the data with the same period in 2019. Statistical analyses included median (median absolute deviation), risk and odds ratios, as well as Fisher’s exact test to calculate the statistical significance, set at p ≤ 0.05. Results — Acute trauma referrals in the post-COVID period were almost halved compared with 2019, with similar distribution between pediatric and adult patients, requiring a significant 19% more admissions (RR 1.3, OR 2.6, p = 0.003). Hip fractures and polytrauma cases accounted for an additional 11% of the modal number of injuries in 2020, but with 19% reduction in isolated limb injuries that were modal in 2019. Total operative cases fell by a third during the COVID-19 outbreak. There was a decrease of 14% (RR 0.85, OR 0.20, p = 0.006) in aerosol-generating anesthetic techniques used. Interpretation — The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a decline in the number of acute trauma referrals, admissions (but increased risk and odds ratio), operations, and aerosolizing anesthetic procedures since implementing social distancing and lockdown measures during the “golden month.”","Park, Chang; Sugand, Kapil; Nathwani, Dinesh; Bhattacharya, Rajarshi; Sarraf, Khaled M",Acta orthopaedica,190,3

Here, we quantify the ancillary impacts on air pollution and human health using inverse emissions estimates based on multiple satellite observations. We find that Chinese NOx emissions were reduced by 36% from early January to mid‐February, with more than 80% of reductions occurring after their respective lockdown in most provinces. The reduced precursor emissions increased surface ozone by up to 16 ppb over northern China but decreased PM2.5 by up to 23 μg m(−3) nationwide. Changes in human exposure are associated with about 2,100 more ozone‐related and at least 60,000 fewer PM2.5‐related morbidity incidences, primarily from asthma cases, thereby augmenting efforts to reduce hospital admissions and alleviate negative impacts from potential delayed treatments.","Miyazaki, K.; Bowman, K.; Sekiya, T.; Jiang, Z.; Chen, X.; Eskes, H.; Ru, M.; Zhang, Y.; Shindell, D.",Geophys Res Lett,190,30

In this study, a one-step real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay based on SYBR Green chemistry and degenerate primers was developed for the generic detection of coronaviruses. The primers, designed in the open reading frame 1b, enabled the detection of 32 animal coronaviruses including strains of canine coronavirus, feline coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), bovine coronavirus (BCoV), murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). A specific amplification was also observed with the human coronaviruses (HCoV) HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The real-time RT-PCR detected down to 10 cRNA copies from TGEV, BCoV, SARS-CoV and IBV. In addition, the assay exhibited a high sensitivity and specificity on clinical samples from different animal species. The developed assay represents a potential tool for laboratory diagnostics and for detecting still uncharacterized coronaviruses.","Escutenaire, S.; Mohamed, N.; Isaksson, M.; Thorén, P.; Klingeborn, B.; Belák, S.; Berg, M.; Blomberg, J.",Arch Virol,190,27

Spatial diffusion theory distinguishes between two dimensions of a diffusion process. On the one hand, the routes may be determined by proximity – spreading to nearby places – or by hierarchical levels – spreading between places in a stepwise manner. On the other hand, the structure of diffusion appears as either expansion or relocation. The geographical context of health and disease can be conceived as epidemiological landscapes or landscapes of exposure. These are dynamic, i.e., their contents and extensions will change over time. The epidemiological transition might appear as a spatial diffusion of diseases, but is rather the outcome of changing ecological preconditions for disease and disease determinants. Increasing spatial connectivity has radically altered the routes and speed of diffusion. Global and local environmental changes alter the prospects for health. In the future, climatic change might affect the living conditions for agents and vectors involved in disease ecology. Understanding the geographical diffusion of diseases is important for predicting and containing diseases. GIS can be very useful tools for public health surveillance, simulation, analysis, and early warning.","Schærström, A.",International Encyclopedia of Human Geography,190,16

Although research shows that continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and flash glucose monitoring (FGM) improves glycaemic control in selected subsets of patients with diabetes in specialty practices, we found no systematic reviews evaluating the use of CGM/FGM in primary care, where the majority of patients with diabetes are cared for.This systematic review aims to answer the questions: 'compared with usual care of self-monitoring blood glucose and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), does the addition of CGM/FGM use in the primary care of patients with diabetes improve glycaemic control, decrease rates of hypoglycaemia, and improve patient and physician satisfaction?' and if so, 'what subgroups of primary care patients with diabetes are most likely to benefit?'. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Aligning with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols guidelines, a search will be conducted in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science. We will include studies investigating CGM/FGM use and reporting the primary outcome measure of HbA1c and secondary outcome measures of hypoglycaemia, time in range, time below range, time above range and patient/staff satisfaction. We will examine which patient populations appear to benefit from CGM/FGM. Three independent researchers will use the Covidence systematic review software for blinded screening and study selection. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute quality assessment tool and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation will be used to assess the risk of bias and quality of evidence.

A mural thrombus in the non-aneurysmal and non-atherosclerotic ascending aorta is exceptionally uncommon. CASE PRESENTATION: We reported a large mural thrombus in normal ascending aorta of an asymptomatic patient. Preoperative imaging confirmed the presence of the sessile thrombus located at the left anterior wall of ascending aorta. Given that it had the potential to cause fatal thrombotic complications, surgical removal and segment of ascending aorta replacement were executed. The patient had an uneventful recovery and discharged 14 days after surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Anticoagulant is the therapeutic cornerstone of ascending aortic thrombus, but surgery should be performed aggressively when the thrombus is large or floating to avoid severe embolic complications or recurrence.","Dai, Xiaoyi; Ni, Chengyao; Luo, Wenzong; Miao, Sihan; Ma, Liang",J Cardiothorac Surg,190,20

Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) play central roles in oxygen sensing. Under hypoxic conditions, the α subunit of HIFs is stabilized and forms active heterodimers that translocate to the nucleus and regulate the expression of important sets of genes. This process, in turn, will induce several physiological changes intended to adapt to these new and adverse conditions. Over the last decades, numerous studies have reported a close relationship between viral infections and hypoxia. Interestingly, this relation is somewhat bidirectional, with some viruses inducing a hypoxic response to promote their replication, while others inhibit hypoxic cellular responses. Here, we review and discuss the cellular responses to hypoxia and discuss how HIFs can promote a wide range of physiological and transcriptional changes in the cell that modulate numerous human viral infections.","Reyes, Antonia; Duarte, Luisa F.; Farías, Mónica A.; Tognarelli, Eduardo; Kalergis, Alexis M.; Bueno, Susan M.; González, Pablo A.",Int J Mol Sci,190,20

METHODS: The sessions involved the use of our existing simulation center faculty, staff, and resources. Feedbacks on the sessions were collected via a survey from faculty and students at the end of each session. RESULTS: Sixteen simulation sessions were conducted (8 febrile infant, 8 anaphylactic toddler). Forty-eight students, 2 technicians, 2 actors, and 10 faculty participated. Ninety percent of the students agreed with the statements, “I am more comfortable with pediatrics after this session,” “participating improved my pediatric knowledge/skills,” “this session was more useful than other learning activities I am involved in at this time.” Seventy percent of the students agreed with the statement, “I learned as much from observing as when I was actively involved.” All faculty agreed with the statement, “this was an effective educational strategy compared to other distance learning.” Most faculty (60%) disagreed with the statement, “virtual simulation was equal to or superior to in-person simulation.” All students and faculty strongly agreed with the statement, “I would highly recommend this to others.” CONCLUSIONS: A telesimulation intervention involving all medical students, staff, and facilitators interacting remotely for pediatric emergency training during COVID was associated with high levels of satisfaction by the majority of learners and faculty.","Yang, Thomas; Buck, Samuel; Evans, Leigh; Auerbach, Marc",Pediatr Emerg Care,190,20

METHODS An observational study on antibody response to a mRNA vaccine (Comirnaty) was performed on health care workers (V, n=120). Recovered COVID-19 patients (N, n=94) were used for comparison. Antibody response was evaluated by a quantitative anti-receptor binding domain IgG (anti-RBD) commercial assay and by virus microneutralization test (MNT), in order to establish a threshold of anti-RBD binding antibody units (BAU) able to predict a robust (≥1:80) MNT titer. RESULTS Significant correlation between BAU and MNT titers was found in both V and N, being stronger in V (rs=0.91 and 0.57 respectively, p<0.001); a higher incremental trend starting from MNT titer 1:80 was observed in the V group. The 99% probability of high MNT titer (≥1:80) was reached at 1,814 and 3,564 BAU/mL, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.99 (CI: 0.99-1.00) and 0.78 (CI: 0.67-0.86) in V and N, respectively. CONCLUSIONS A threshold of 2,000 BAU/mL is highly predictive of strong MNT response in vaccinated individuals and may represent a good surrogate marker of protective response. It remains to be established whether the present results can be extended to BAU titers obtained with other assays.","Meschi, Silvia; Matusali, Giulia; Colavita, Francesca; Lapa, Daniele; Bordi, Licia; Puro, Vincenzo; Leoni, Bruno D; Galli, Claudio; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Castilletti, Concetta",Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine,190,16

During this time, teacher and student creative beliefs and affect play a supportive role in adaptively managing stress, finding joy, and bouncing back from inevitable setbacks with resilience. Developing an adaptive orientation to creativity is a critically important step in helping teachers deal with the challenges and stress of reaching their students through distance learning, especially the most marginalized. This study aims to understand how teacher creativity linked to well-being in the face of COVID-19-related school shutdowns and how teachers planned to adapt creatively to distance learning through the guidance of a summer creative teaching training institute. Results from this sequential mixed method study demonstrated important relationships. Creative self-efficacy in teaching related to teacher buoyancy in the face of setbacks. Creative growth mindset related to teachers’ general positive affect in teaching. Lowered creative anxiety related to reduced effects of secondary traumatic stress and general negative affect in teaching. Environmental support and encouragement for creativity in schools may be foundational for teacher well-being by enhancing teachers’ dispositional joy, general positive affect, and reducing general negative affect. Results suggested additional stress and loss of creativity for most teachers due to the COVID-19 pandemic alongside substantial capacity for creative adaptations with the support of training for creativity in teaching and learning.","Anderson, Ross C.; Bousselot, Tracy; Katz-Buoincontro, Jen; Todd, Jandee",Front Psychol,190,1

An online survey (N = 1,199) examined the relationships among media trust, emotional and cognitive reactions to COVID-19 information overload, media attention, and risk perceptions regarding COVID-19. Participants' media attention (exposure and attention combined) to information about the pandemic was positively related to their risk perceptions (perceived susceptibility and severity) about the disease. Media attention was dependent on participants' trust in the media as valid sources of information, but also on their cognitive and emotional reactions to COVID-19 information overload. In response to this overload, they produced negative thoughts and more negative (fear and anger) than positive (protection) emotions. These distinct reactions had differential effects on media attention and risk perceptions. Fear and protection were positively related to media attention and risk perceptions, while anger and negative thinking undermined attention and perceptions. Furthermore, all reactions depended on media trust, which mediated the effect on media attention.

After ruling out COVID-19 infection, a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation was confirmed and he was thus transferred to the nephrology division. Physical examination and blood tests revealed a positive fluid balance and insufficient correction of the uraemic syndrome, although peritoneal dialysis prescription was maximised. After discussion with the patient and his family, the staff decided to start hybrid dialysis, consisting of once-weekly in-hospital haemodialysis and home peritoneal dialysis for the remaining days. He was discharged at the end of the antibiotic course, after an internal jugular vein central venous catheter placement and the first haemodialysis session. This strategy allowed improvement of depuration parameters and avoidance of frequent access to the hospital, which is crucial in limiting exposure to SARS-CoV-2 in an endemic setting.","Mori, Giacomo; Alfano, Gaetano; Fontana, Francesco; Magistroni, Riccardo",BMJ Case Rep,190,32

Participants aged 60–78 years were randomized to either a control group (n = 15) or a tai chi group (n = 15) for a 10-week period. The tai chi group received two, 8-form tai chi classes of 60 min duration per week. Changes in psychoemotional state, cognition, and the learning of fast and accurate reaching movements were assessed. In addition, the potential roles of the autonomic nervous system and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were investigated. Tai chi practice decreased (P < 0.05) perceived stress, whereas no change in autonomic nervous system activity was observed. Improvements in mental switching correlated with decreased depressive symptoms and increased BDNF levels (P < 0.05), whereas improvements in inhibitory control tended to correlate with BDNF levels (P = 0.08). Improvements in visuospatial processing tended to correlate with decreased depressive symptoms (P = 0.07) while improved visuospatial processing correlated with improved motor planning during learning tasks (P < 0.05). This study suggests that tai chi is an effective intervention that can be delivered under pandemic conditions to improve mental and physical function in older adults.","Solianik, Rima; Mickevičienė, Dalia; Žlibinaitė, Laura; Čekanauskaitė, Agnė",Exp Gerontol,190,24

Due to its high transmissibility, this virus quickly spread throughout the world, causing considerable health issues. The scientific community exerted noteworthy efforts to obtain therapeutic solutions for COVID-19, and new scientific networks were constituted. No certified drugs to efficiently inhibit the virus were identified, and the development of de-novo medicines requires approximately ten years of research. Therefore, the repurposing of natural products could be an effective strategy to handle SARS-CoV-2 infection. This review aims to update on current status of the natural occurring compounds recognizing SARS-CoV-2 druggable targets. Among the clinical trials actually recruited, some natural compounds are ongoing to examine their potential role to prevent and to treat the COVID-19 infection. Many natural scaffolds, including alkaloids, terpenes, flavonoids, and benzoquinones, were investigated by in-silico, in-vitro, and in-vivo approaches. Despite the large data set obtained by a computational approach, experimental evidences in most cases are not available. To fill this gap, further efforts to validate these results are required. We believe that an accurate investigation of naturally occurring compounds may provide insights for the potential treatment of COVID-19 patients.","Romeo, Isabella; Mesiti, Francesco; Lupia, Antonio; Alcaro, Stefano",Molecules,190,16

Following stakeholder theory and consumption capital theory, this study investigated the actions of the German Bundesliga (DFL), Union of European Football Associations (UEFA), and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) during this phase as perceived by the German population and through the lens of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Based on a representative sample of the German resident population (N = 1,000), the study examined the individual characteristics that influenced the perceived CSR of these organizations and what population clusters emerged from this perception. The survey applied a CSR scale that was previously validated in a professional team sports context. The results confirmed the equally strong applicability of the scale to the sport governing context. Cluster analysis yielded three distinctive clusters, namely, “supporters,” “neutral observers,” and “critics.” Regression analyses and the cluster analysis identified those with frequent consumption and high involvement in sport as rating the actions of the three sport organizations more positively. They are also more strongly represented in the “supporters” cluster. In contrast, those threatened the most by the virus are overrepresented in the “critics” cluster.","Thormann, Tim F.; Wicker, Pamela",Front Sports Act Living,190,3

This review describes the main clinical features of COVID-19 and potential role of microbiota in COVID-19. SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have 79.5% nucleotide sequence identity and use angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to enter host cells. The distribution of ACE2 may determine how SARS-CoV-2 infects the respiratory and digestive tract. SARS and COVID-19 share similar clinical features, although the estimated fatality rate of COVID-19 is much lower. The communication between the microbiota and SARS-CoV-2 and the role of this association in diagnosis and treatment are unclear. Changes in the lung microbiota were identified in COVID-19 patients, and the enrichment of the lung microbiota with bacteria found in the intestinal tract is correlated with the onset of acute respiratory distress syndrome and long-term outcomes. ACE2 regulates the gut microbiota by indirectly controlling the secretion of antimicrobial peptides. Moreover, the gut microbiota enhances antiviral immunity by increasing the number and function of immune cells, decreasing immunopathology, and stimulating interferon production. In turn, respiratory viruses are known to influence microbial composition in the lung and intestine. Therefore, the analysis of changes in the microbiota during SARS-CoV-2 infection may help predict patient outcomes and allow the development of microbiota-based therapies.","He, Yu; Wang, Jianhui; Li, Fang; Shi, Yuan",Front Microbiol,190,22

However, the way in which the resulting scores or classifications are produced from the input data may not be transparent. Algorithmic explainability or interpretability has become a focus of ML research. Shapley values, first introduced in game theory, can provide explanations of the result generated from a specific set of input data by a complex ML algorithm. METHODS: For a multivariate molecular diagnostic test in clinical use (the VeriStrat® test), we calculate and discuss the interpretation of exact Shapley values. We also employ some standard approximation techniques for Shapley value computation (local interpretable model-agnostic explanation (LIME) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) based methods) and compare the results with exact Shapley values. RESULTS: Exact Shapley values calculated for data collected from a cohort of 256 patients showed that the relative importance of attributes for test classification varied by sample. While all eight features used in the VeriStrat® test contributed equally to classification for some samples, other samples showed more complex patterns of attribute importance for classification generation. Exact Shapley values and Shapley-based interaction metrics were able to provide interpretable classification explanations at the sample or patient level, while patient subgroups could be defined by comparing Shapley value profiles between patients. LIME and SHAP approximation approaches, even those seeking to include correlations between attributes, produced results that were quantitatively and, in some cases qualitatively, different from the exact Shapley values. CONCLUSIONS: Shapley values can be used to determine the relative importance of input attributes to the result generated by a multivariate molecular diagnostic test for an individual sample or patient. Patient subgroups defined by Shapley value profiles may motivate translational research. However, correlations inherent in molecular data and the typically small ML training sets available for molecular diagnostic test development may cause some approximation methods to produce approximate Shapley values that differ both qualitatively and quantitatively from exact Shapley values. Hence, caution is advised when using approximate methods to evaluate Shapley explanations of the results of molecular diagnostic tests.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been one of the worst of its kind in the last century with regard to global deaths and, in the absence of any effective treatment, it led to governments worldwide mandating lock-down measures, as well as citizens voluntarily reducing non-essential trips and activities. In this study, the influence of decreased activity on CO(2) emissions and on the economy was assessed. The US, EU-28, China and India, representing almost 60% of anthropogenic carbon emissions, were considered as reference entities and the trends were extrapolated to estimate the global impact. This study aimed to deduce initial estimates of anthropogenic CO(2) emissions based on the available economic and industrial outputs and activity data, as they could not be directly measured. Sector-wise variations in emissions were modeled by assuming proportionality of the outputs/activities and the resulting emissions. A decline in road traffic was seen up to March 2020 and then a steady growth was observed, with the exception of China where road traffic started to recover by the end of January. The vast majority of passenger flights were grounded and, therefore, global air traffic plummeted by 43.7% from January to May 2020. A considerable drop in coal power production and the annual industrial growth rate was also observed. The overall economic decline led to a drop of 4.9% in annual global gross domestic product (GDP) for Q2 2020. The total global CO(2) emissions reduction for January through April 2020 compared to the year before was estimated to be 1749 Mt. CO(2) (14.3%) with a maximum contribution from the transportation sector (58.3% among total emissions by sector). Like other previous crises, if the economy rebounds as expected the reductions will be temporary. Long-term impacts can be minimized considering the business as well as lifestyle changes for travel, utilizing virtual structures created during this crisis, and switching to sustainable transportation.","Sikarwar, Vineet Singh; Reichert, Annika; Jeremias, Michal; Manovic, Vasilije",Sci Total Environ,190,16

However, it is unclear whether this increased risk is affected by any changes in lockdown restrictions, and whether any lifestyle changes could moderate this increased risk. Methods: In a longitudinal UK population-based cohort (The Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, ALSPAC) we assessed the relationship between pre-pandemic measures of disordered eating and self-harm and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2,657 young adults. Regression models examined the relationship between self-reported disordered eating, self-harm, and both disordered eating and self-harm at age 25 years and depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms and mental wellbeing during a period of eased restrictions in the COVID-19 pandemic (May-July 2020) when participants were aged 27-29 years. Analyses were adjusted for sex, questionnaire completion date, pre-pandemic socioeconomic disadvantage and pre-pandemic mental health and wellbeing. We also examined whether lifestyle changes (sleep, exercise, alcohol, visiting green space, eating, talking with family/friends, hobbies, relaxation) in the initial UK lockdown (April-May 2020) moderated these associations. Results: Pre-existing disordered eating, self-harm and comorbid disordered eating and self-harm were all associated with the reporting of a higher frequency of depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms, and poorer mental wellbeing during the pandemic compared to individuals without disordered eating and self-harm. Associations remained when adjusting for pre-pandemic mental health measures. There was little evidence that interactions between disordered eating and self-harm exposures and lifestyle change moderators affected pandemic mental health and wellbeing. Conclusions: Young adults with pre-pandemic disordered eating, self-harm and comorbid disordered eating and self-harm are at increased risk for developing symptoms of depression, anxiety and poor mental wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic, even when accounting for pre-pandemic mental health. Lifestyle changes during the pandemic do not appear to alter this risk. A greater focus on rapid and responsive service provision is essential to reduce the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of these already vulnerable individuals.","Warne, N.; Heron, J.; Mars, B.; Kwong, A.

Their use is intended as personal protection to prevent infection and as source control to limit transmission of the virus in a community or healthcare setting.

Methods In this prospective observational study, we compared the incidence of VAP and secondary infections using a combination of a TaqMan multi-pathogen array and microbial culture. In addition, we determined the lung microbime composition using 16S RNA analyisis. The study involved eighteen COVID-19 and seven non-COVID-19 patients receiving invasive ventilation in three ICUs located in a single University teaching hospital between April 13th 2020 and May 7th 2020. Results We observed a higher percentage of confirmed VAP in COVID-19 patients. However, there was no statistical difference in the detected organisms or pulmonary microbiome when compared to non-COVID-19 patients.

Methods A total of 523 patients enrolled from four hospitals in Wuhan, China. The inclusion time was from January 2, 2020 to February 15. Clinical characteristics and laboratory values were obtained from electronic medical records, nursing records, and related examinations. Results Of these patients, 211 (40.3%) were admitted to the ICU and 115 deaths (22.0%). Patients admitted to the ICU had lower BMI and plasma protein levels. The median Nutrition risk in critically ill (NUTRIC) score of 211patients in the ICU was 5(4, 6) and Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS) score was 5(3, 6). The ratio of parenteral nutrition (PN) therapy in non-survivors was greater than that in survivors, and the time to start nutrition therapy was later than that in survivors. The NUTRIC score can independently predict the risk of death in the hospital (OR=1.197, 95%CI: 1.091-1.445, p=0.006) and high NRS score patients have a higher risk of poor outcome in the ICU (OR=1.880, 95%CI: 1.151-3.070, p=0.012). After adjusted age and sex, for each standard deviation increase in BMI, the risk of in-hospital death was reduced by 13% (HR=0.871, 95%CI: 0.795-0.955, p=0.003), and the risk of ICU transfer was reduced by 7% (HR=0.932, 95%CI:0.885-0.981, p=0.007).

Huge efforts from pharmacological industries have led to the development of COVID-19 vaccines. In particular two mRNA vaccines, namely the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and the mRNA-1273 (Moderna), and a viral-vectored vaccine, i.e. ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca), have recently been approved in Europe. Clinical trials on these vaccines have been published on the general population showing a high efficacy with minor adverse events. However, specific data about the efficacy and safety of these vaccines in patients with immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are still lacking. Moreover, the limited availability of these vaccines requires prioritizing some vulnerable categories of patients compared to others. In this position paper, we propose the point of view about the management of COVID-19 vaccination from Italian experts on IMIDs and the identification of high-risk groups according to the different diseases and their chronic therapy.","Ferretti, Francesca; Cannatelli, Rosanna; Benucci, Maurizio; Carmagnola, Stefania; Clementi, Emilio; Danelli, Piergiorgio; Dilillo, Dario; Fiorina, Paolo; Galli, Massimo; Gallieni, Maurizio; Genovese, Giovanni; Giorgi, Valeria; Invernizzi, Alessandro; Maconi, Giovanni; Maier, Jeanette A.; Marzano, Angelo V.; Morpurgo, Paola S.; Nebuloni, Manuela; Radovanovic, Dejan; Riva, Agostino; Rizzardini, Giuliano; Sabiu, Gianmarco; Santus, Pierachille; Staurenghi, Giovanni; Zuccotti, Gianvincenzo; Sarzi-Puttini, Pier Carlo; Ardizzone, Sandro",Front Immunol,190,32

While general practitioners care for COVID patients who are less severely ill, hospitals are focused on the care of severely ill COVID-19 patients. STANDARD TREATMENT: The role of emergency medicine (EM) is to rapidly detect the virus, to classify disease severity, and to initiate therapy. In addition, the flow of patients into the hospital must be directed in such a way that optimal care is provided without risk of infecting health care personnel and patients. Despite optimal intensive care treatment, the mortality of patients remains high if organ failure develops, especially in patients who are older or have pre-existing conditions. TREATMENT INNOVATIONS: Rapid diagnosis of patients with SARS-CoV‑2 infection together with assessment of disease severity and awareness of organ failure are the mainstays of emergency care. Intensive care is needed for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2-induced organ failure, whereby lung failure in these patients requires differentiated ventilation therapies. DIAGNOSTIC WORK-UP: The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test is performed to diagnose SARS-CoV‑2 infection. Adjunctive diagnostic measures which enhance diagnostic specificity are lung ultrasound, x‑ray, and computed tomography of the lungs. This also allows categorization of the type of COVID-19 pneumonia. PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS: For early detection and appropriate treatment of SARS-CoV‑2 infection, PCR is needed. Adjunctive sonographic and radiological examinations allow the treatment of COVID-19 patients to be tailored according to the specific type of pneumonia.","Dodt, C.; Schneider, N.",Radiologe,190,22

METHODS: Records of 71 cats (82 eyes) from five referral centers were reviewed. Groups were divided by cause of cataract (congenital/juvenile [n = 32], traumatic [n = 33], and secondary to uveitis [n = 6]), and group comparisons were performed for the most common complications: postoperative ocular hypertension (POH), uveitis, corneal ulceration, synechia/dyscoria, and posterior capsular opacity (PCO) in three different time periods: immediately postoperatively, at 1‐90 days, and at >90 days. RESULTS: Median follow‐up was 198 days (interquartile range 64‐518 days). The overall visual success rate of the cats with a 12‐month follow‐up was 92.6% (25/27 eyes). POH occurred in 35/82 (42.6%) eyes. Immediately postoperatively, uveitis was the most common complication in 28/82 eyes (34.1%) followed by corneal ulceration in 22/82 eyes (26.8%). At 1‐90 days, uveitis in 41/81 eyes (50.6%) remained the most common complication, followed by synechia/dyscoria in 21/81 eyes (25.9%), corneal ulceration in 16/81 eyes (19.7%), and PCO in 15/81 eyes (18.5%). At >90 days, PCO in 17/47 eyes (36.1%), followed by synechia/dyscoria in 16/47 eyes (34%), was the most common complications. The number of eyes with synechia/dyscoria in the trauma group was higher (13/33 [39.3%]) than in the congenital/juvenile group (5/31 [16.1%]) at 1‐90 days (P = .039). No statistical difference was found for the other group comparisons. Three eyes in total were enucleated owing to endophthalmitis, post‐traumatic ocular sarcoma, and secondary glaucoma. CONCLUSION: Uveitis in the short‐term and PCO and synechia/dyscoria in the long‐term were the most common complications following phacoemulsification in cats.","Fenollosa‐Romero, Elena; Jeanes, Emily; Freitas, Ines; Enache, Andra‐Elena; Lockhart, Rachel; Fleming, Lorraine; Knott, Timothy N.

Consequently, the number of cases increased exponentially until a lockdown was implemented to suppress the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Fortunately, Germany has a high capability for coronavirus lab testing and more than 30,000 ICU beds. These capabilities and the lockdown turned out to be an advantage to combat the pandemic and to prevent a health-system overload. AIM: The aim was to predict the plateau day of SARS-CoV-2 infections or deaths. RESULTS: The effect on the viral spread of the German measures taken and the impact on the peak of new infection cases is shown. By normalizing daily case numbers, the plateau day of the current outbreak in Germany could be calculated to be reached at April 12, 2020 (day 103 of 2020). CONCLUSION: Normalized case number curves are helpful to predict the time point at which no further new infections will occur if the epidemic situation remains stable. Upon reaching the plateau day during a lockdown phase, a residual time-period of about 2-3 weeks can be utilized to prepare a safe unlocking period. As can be learned from Asian countries such as South Korea and Taiwan there must be strict rules to keep the risk of infection low. Those include social distancing, face mask wearing in combination with digital contact tracing and serosurveillance studies. Following those rules, a safe dance around the infection curve allows to keep the population at a reduced infection rate.","Jung, F.; Krieger, V.; Hufert, F.T.; Küpper, J.-H.",Clinical hemorheology and microcirculation,190,24

To answer the question, this article examines three decades of energy and climate policies in China. By providing an overarching review, it contributes new and updated research on drivers behind long-term climate policies and whether China’s long-term emissions trend can be broken by placing greater emphasis on innovation, technology and low-carbon development. Importantly, it analyses the most recent policy developments in China, such as the likely effects of China’s recent 2060 carbon neutrality goal. We conclude that after the Paris Agreement, the biggest policy change has been technological innovation in the power and transport sector. China has prioritized measures, laws and policies for developing renewable energy, especially solar and wind. China has also embraced the ‘green growth’ approach for responding to the challenges of climate change. These efforts have yielded results, and China has emerged as a world leader in renewable energy. However, there is still a long way to go. The upcoming 14th five-year plan will be critical for accelerating the energy transition, including setting a cap on coal in the national energy-transition strategy.","Heggelund, Gørild M.",Int Environ Agreem,190,5

Samples collected from commercial broiler flocks (n= 52) showing respiratory syndrome. Specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers were designed for a variable region locates in RdRp gene, flanked by highly conserved regions. Reverse transcriptase PCR (RT‐PCR) followed by sequencing and sequence analysis could identified 8 IBV variants in an overall prevalence of 44.2%.

OBJECTIVE: In response to the coronavirus pandemic, a questionnaire was created and administered to Pediatric Emergency Department (PED) patients in order to identify psychosocial stress and coping abilities. METHODS: A 12-question (yes/no) quality improvement (QI) paper-based questionnaire was administered by PED providers to assess psychosocial stress and coping among patients 12 years and greater who presented to the PED at a tertiary Children’s Hospital, March-September 2020. Questions were asked/recorded to determine rates of distress and provide social work intervention, if needed. Analysis-Chi-squared, Fisher’s exact, and Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: Among 1261 PED patients who participated in the study, the mean age was 15.4 years (SD = 2.4), (58% female, 41.5% male, 0.6% missing data). We identified 611 patients (48.5%) who admitted to feeling scared about contracting the disease, 876 patients (69.5%) who were concerned about the health of their families, and 229 patients (18.2%) who screened positive for food insecurity. In addition, 596 patients (47.3%) felt anxiety, 333 patients (26.4%) felt depressed, and 13 patients (1%) admitted to having suicidal ideation because of COVID-19. The majority of patients, 1165 (92.4%), felt supported during the pandemic. Social work was consulted for 235 (18.6%) of patients participating. CONCLUSIONS: While patients typically present to PEDs for a somatic complaint, screening their psychosocial and emotional states may reveal underlying mental health concerns that require intervention and at times, assistance from social workers.","Yau, Ji-Ting Janet; Nager, Alan L.",Int J Emerg Med,190,1

Methods An online survey of 236 Chinese-speaking gay and bisexual men in Hong Kong conducted in 2020. Results It was found that among those who expressed a need of accessing HIV services during COVID-19, 22.9%, 33.9% and 43.2% indicated moderate-to-high, mild, and no difficulties in accessing HIV services respectively. Difficulties in accessing HIV services were positively related to concerns about potential COVID-19 infection, experience of actual impact on health because of COVID-19, disruption in work/studies and reduced connection to the LGBT + community during the pandemic. It was also found that difficulties in accessing HIV services were positively associated with frequency of having sex with casual partners but was not significantly associated with frequency of having sex with regular partners. Conclusions This paper provides novel empirical evidence for understanding difficulties in accessing HIV services during COVID-19.

Considering the limiting character of resource allocation, all other medical conditions must compete with the top spot of health security matters, as we currently see with the outbreak of COVID-19. Surgery is an integral part of universal health offering life-saving therapy for a variety of illnesses. Amidst the increasing nexus of infectious diseases and health security and in the view of Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC), is there a risk of global surgery falling behind? SUBJECT AND METHODS: While the global undersupply of surgical care is well recorded, contextual explanations are absent. Our research introduces the constructivist concept of securitization according to the Copenhagen School to explain the structural handicap of global surgery and by that presents a structural explanation. We investigate the securitizing potential of surgical diseases in comparison to infectious diseases. RESULTS: Surgical conditions are non-contagious without the risk for disease outbreaks, hardly preventable and their treatment is often infrastructurally demanding. These key features mark their low securitizing potential. Additionally, as PHEIC is the only securitizing institution in the realm of health, infectious diseases have a privileged role in health security. CONCLUSION: Surgery substantially lacks securitizing potential in comparison to communicable diseases and by that is structurally given an inferior position in a securitized health order.","Metelmann, Isabella B.; Flessa, Steffen; Busemann, Alexandra",Z Gesundh Wiss,190,8

Aim To explore perceptions and psychosocial experiences of frontline staff providing care at UDCs in England during COVID-19. Method A qualitative research study using a phenomenological approach. Semi-structured interviews were conducted remotely. Using line-by-line coding, data were analysed using a hybrid approach that incorporated both a deductive, theoretical process and an inductive, data-driven process. Results Participants included 29 dentists and nine dental nurses from UDCs across England. Twelve themes were identified and grouped into positive and negative experiences. Positive experiences were: role fulfilment and having a sense of purpose; team unity and collective coping strategies; and strategic teamwork and preparedness for effective organisation of care. Negative experiences included: feeling undervalued and frustrated due to fragmented guidance and communication; sense of unfairness generated by relational challenges; patient demand outstripping UDC capacity; complex decision-making; uncertainty over safety; suffocating PPE hindering effective communication; ineffective communication channels across healthcare sectors; lack of commitment to remote video consultations; and variable referral quality. Conclusions Participants reported experiencing a number of emotional challenges that appeared to be exacerbated by an unsupportive environment, often due to lack of leadership. However, positive experiences and coping strategies were also identified. Collective and sustained efforts at system level to improve the resilience and mental wellbeing of the current and future dental workforce and integration of dentistry into wider healthcare infrastructures are needed.

Diagnosis of pneumonia in chest X-ray images can be difficult and error-prone because of its similarity with other infections in the lungs. The aim of this study is to develop a computer-aided pneumonia detection system to facilitate the diagnosis decision process. Therefore, a convolutional neural network (CNN) ensemble method was proposed for the automatic diagnosis of pneumonia which is seen in children. In this context, seven well-known CNN models (VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet-50, Inception-V3, Xception, MobileNet, and SqueezeNet) pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset were trained with the appropriate transfer learning and fine-tuning strategies on the chest X-ray dataset. Among the seven different models, the three most successful ones were selected for the ensemble method. The final results were obtained by combining the predictions of CNN models with the ensemble method during the test. In addition, a CNN model was trained from scratch, and the results of this model were compared with the proposed ensemble method. The proposed ensemble method achieved remarkable results with an AUC of 95.21 and a sensitivity of 97.76 on the test data. Also, the proposed ensemble method achieved classification accuracy of 90.71 in chest X-ray images as normal, viral pneumonia, and bacterial pneumonia.","Ayan, Enes; Karabulut, Bergen; Ünver, Halil Murat",Arab J Sci Eng,190,26

In school-based settings, for low-risk and/or likely-beneficial interventions or surveys, data quality and ethical standards are both arguably stronger when using a waiver of parental consent—but doing so often requires the use of anonymous data collection methods. The standard solution to this problem has been the use of a self-generated identification code. However, such codes often incorporate personalized elements (e.g., birth month, middle initial) that, even when meeting the technical standard for anonymity, may raise concerns among both youth participants and their parents, potentially altering willingness to participate, response quality, or generating outrage. There may be value, therefore, in developing a self-generated identification code and matching approach that not only is technically anonymous but also appears anonymous to a research-naive individual. This article provides a proof of concept for a novel matching approach for school-based longitudinal data collection that potentially accomplishes this goal.","Agley, Jon; Tidd, David; Jun, Mikyoung; Eldridge, Lori; Xiao, Yunyu; Sussman, Steve; Jayawardene, Wasantha; Agley, Daniel; Gassman, Ruth; Dickinson, Stephanie L.",Educ Psychol Meas,190,1

The mass testing needed to limit the spread of the virus requires new molecular diagnostic tests to dramatically widen access at the point-of-care in resource-limited settings. Isothermal molecular assays have emerged as a promising technology, given the faster turn-around time and minimal equipment compared to gold standard laboratory PCR methods. However, unlike PCR, they do not typically target multiple SARS-CoV-2 genes, risking sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, they often require multiple steps thus adding complexity and delays. Here we develop a multiplexed, 1-2 step, fast (20-30 minutes) SARS-CoV-2 molecular test using reverse transcription recombinase polymerase amplification to simultaneously detect two conserved targets - the E and RdRP genes. The agile multi-gene platform offers two complementary detection methods: real-time fluorescence or dipstick. The analytical sensitivity of the fluorescence test was 9.5 (95% CI: 7.0-18) RNA copies per reaction for the E gene and 17 (95% CI: 11-93) RNA copies per reaction for the RdRP gene. The analytical sensitivity for the dipstick was 130 (95% CI: 82-500) RNA copies per reaction. High specificity was found against common seasonal coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV model samples. The dipstick readout demonstrated potential for point-of-care testing in decentralised settings, with minimal or equipment-free incubation methods and a user-friendly prototype smartphone application. This rapid, simple, ultrasensitive and multiplexed molecular test offers valuable advantages over gold standard tests and in future could be configurated to detect emerging variants of concern.","Cherkaoui, Dounia; Huang, Da; Miller, Benjamin S.; Turbé, Valérian; McKendry, Rachel A.",Biosens Bioelectron,190,16

Triggers for neuroinflammation not only include pathogens, trauma and toxic metabolites, but also autoimmune diseases such as neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders and multiple sclerosis (MS) where the inflammatory response is recognized as a disease-escalating factor. B cells are not considered as the first responders of neuroinflammation, yet they have recently gained focus as a key component involved in the disease pathogenesis of several neuroinflammatory disorders like MS. Traditionally, the prime focus of the role of B cells in any disease, including neuroinflammatory diseases, was their ability to produce antibodies. While that may indeed be an important contribution of B cells in mediating disease pathogenesis, several lines of recent evidence indicate that B cells are multifunctional players during an inflammatory response, including their ability to present antigens and produce an array of cytokines. Moreover, interaction between B cells and other cellular components of the immune system or nervous system can either promote or dampen neuroinflammation depending on the disease. Given that the interest in B cells in neuroinflammation is relatively new, the precise roles that they play in the pathophysiology and progression of different neuroinflammatory disorders have not yet been well-elucidated. Furthermore, the possibility that they might change their function during the course of neuroinflammation adds another level of complexity and the puzzle remains incomplete. Indeed, advancing our knowledge on the role of B cells in neuroinflammation would also allow us to tackle these disorders better. Here, we review the available literature to explore the relationship between autoimmune and infectious neuroinflammation with a focus on the involvement of B cells in MS and viral infections of the CNS.","Chunder, Rittika; Schropp, Verena; Kuerten, Stefanie",Front Neurol,190,1

RESEARCH QUESTION: To examine the relevance of the novel inflammatory factor heparin-binding protein (HBP) in critically ill COVID-19 patients, and evaluate the correlation of the biomarker with disease progression. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Eighteen critically ill COVID-19 patients who suffered from respiratory failure and sepsis, including 12 cases who experienced a rapidly deteriorating clinical condition and 6 cases without deterioration, were investigated. They were compared with 15 age- and sex- matched COVID-19 negative patients with respiratory failure. Clinical data were collected and HBP levels were investigated. RESULTS: HBP was significantly increased in critically ill COVID-19 patients following disease aggravation and tracked with disease progression. HBP elevation preceded the clinical manifestations for up to 5 days and was closely correlated with patients’ pulmonary ventilation and perfusion status. INTERPRETATION: HBP levels are associated with COVID-19 disease progression in critically ill patients. As a potential mediator of disease aggravation and multiple organ injuries that are triggered by continuing inflammation and oxygen deficits, HBP warrants further study as a disease biomarker and potential therapeutic target.","Xue, Mingshan; Zeng, Yifeng; Qu, Hui-Qi; Zhang, Teng; Li, Ning; Huang, Huimin; Zheng, Peiyan; Hu, Haisheng; Zhou, Luqian; Duan, Zhifeng; Zhang, Yong; Bao, Wei; Tian, Li-feng; Hakonarson, Hakon; Zhong, Nanshan; Zhang, Xiaohua Douglas; Sun, Baoqing",ERJ Open Res,190,1

Sequential viral loads and deep sequencing of SARS‐CoV‐2 from the upper respiratory tract of nine hospitalized children, three of whom were treated with remdesivir, revealed that remdesivir treatment suppressed viral load in one patient but not in a second infected with an identical strain without any evidence of drug resistance found. Reduced levels of subgenomic RNA during treatment of the second patient, suggest an additional effect of remdesivir on viral replication. Haplotype reconstruction uncovered persistent SARS‐CoV‐2 variant genotypes in four patients. These likely arose from within‐host evolution, although superinfection cannot be excluded in one case. Although our dataset is small, observed sample‐to‐sample heterogeneity in variant frequencies across four of nine patients suggests the presence of discrete viral populations in the lung with incomplete population sampling in diagnostic swabs. Such compartmentalization could compromise the penetration of remdesivir into the lung, limiting the drugs in vivo efficacy, as has been observed in other lung infections.","Boshier, Florencia A.
