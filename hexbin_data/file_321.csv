1791,1791,1791,Procalcitonin and C-reactive protein cannot differentiate bacterial or viral infection in COPD exacerbation requiring emergency department visits,8.518428,5.2087436,2015-04-13,"BACKGROUND: Viral and bacterial infections are the most common causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. Whether serum inflammatory markers can differentiate bacterial from virus infection in patients with COPD exacerbation requiring emergency department (ED) visits remains controversial. METHODS: Viral culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were used to identify the viruses in the oropharynx of patients with COPD exacerbations. The bacteria were identified by the semiquantitative culture of the expectorated sputum. The peripheral blood white blood cell (WBC) counts, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), and clinical symptoms were compared among patients with different types of infections. RESULTS: Viruses were isolated from 16 (22.2%) of the 72 patients enrolled. The most commonly identified viruses were parainfluenza type 3, influenza A, and rhinovirus. A total of 30 (41.7%) patients had positive bacterial cultures, with the most commonly found bacteria being Haemophilus influenzae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae. Five patients (6.9%) had both positive sputum cultures and virus identification. The WBC, CRP, and PCT levels of the bacteria-positive and bacteria-negative groups were not statistically different. Multivariate analysis showed that patients with increased sputum volumes during the COPD exacerbations had higher risks of recurrent exacerbations in the 1-year period following the first exacerbation. CONCLUSION: WBC, CRP, or PCT could not differentiate between bacterial and viral infections in patients with COPD exacerbation requiring ED visits. Those with increased sputum during a COPD exacerbation had higher risks for recurrent exacerbations.","Chang, Chih-Hao; Tsao, Kuo-Chien; Hu, Han-Chung; Huang, Chung-Chi; Kao, Kuo-Chin; Chen, Ning-Hung; Yang, Cheng-Ta; Tsai, Ying-Huang; Hsieh, Meng-Jer",Int J Chron Obstruct Pulmon Dis,321,1

It affects 45–87% of critical care patients and is often associated with adverse outcomes including acquired dementia, institutionalisation, and death. Despite an exponential increase in delirium research in recent years, the pathophysiological mechanisms resulting in the clinical presentation of delirium are still hypotheses. Efforts have been made to categorise the delirium spectrum into clinically meaningful subgroups (subphenotypes), using psychomotor subtypes such as hypoactive, hyperactive, and mixed, for example, and also inflammatory and non-inflammatory delirium. Delirium remains, however, a constellation of symptoms resulting from a variety of risk factors and precipitants with currently no successful targeted pharmacological treatment. Identifying specific clinical and biological subphenotypes will greatly improve understanding of the relationship between the clinical symptoms and the putative pathways and thus risk factors, precipitants, natural history, and biological mechanism. This will facilitate risk factor mitigation, identification of potential methods for interventional studies, and informed patient and family counselling. Here, we review evidence to date and propose a framework to identify subphenotypes. Endotype identification may be done by clustering symptoms with their biological mechanism, which will facilitate research of targeted treatments. In order to achieve identification of delirium subphenotypes, the following steps must be taken: (1) robust records of symptoms must be kept at a clinical level. (2) Global collaboration must facilitate large, heterogeneous research cohorts. (3) Patients must be clustered for identification, validation, and mapping of subphenotype stability.","Bowman, Emily M. L.; Cunningham, Emma L.; Page, Valerie J.; McAuley, Daniel F.",Crit Care,321,1

It is thus significant to design generalized ways to perform FE. The primary difficulties arise from the multiform information to consider, the potentially infinite number of possible features and the high computational cost of feature generation and evaluation. We present a framework called Cross-data Automatic Feature Engineering Machine (CAFEM), which formalizes the FE problem as an optimization problem over a Feature Transformation Graph (FTG). CAFEM contains two components: a FE learner (FeL) that learns fine-grained FE strategies on one single dataset by Double Deep Q-learning (DDQN) and a Cross-data Component (CdC) that speeds up FE learning on an unseen dataset by the generalized FE policies learned by Meta-Learning on a collection of datasets. We compare the performance of FeL with several existing state-of-the-art automatic FE techniques on a large collection of datasets. It shows that FeL outperforms existing approaches and is robust on the selection of learning algorithms. Further experiments also show that CdC can not only speed up FE learning but also increase learning performance.","Zhang, Jianyu; Hao, Jianye; Fogelman-Soulié, Françoise",Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,321,1

The main aim is to expand IoT applications and services into various domains while ensuring communication and automated exchange between them. Recent research handles many issues related to IoT especially implementation, modeling, and deployment. However, many challenges need more deep and thorough analysis especially in terms of flexible modeling, extensible implementation, with respect to the privacy issue. This work focuses principally on modeling IoT systems dedicated to smart healthcare case. We attempt to address the emergency service by initiating a modeling mechanism for Healthcare Management System (HMS) by using UML diagrams, and propose an appropriate access control in order to reinforce it. Then, we ensure the correctness of the developed HMS by relying on the verification and validation based on a formal analysis that showed significant results by using Alloy tool.","Ouchani, Samir; Krichen, Moez",The Impact of Digital Technologies on Public Health in Developed and Developing Countries,321,0

Negation as opposed to truth-conditional affirmation has been very much present in Indian and Western thought from very early times. R. S. Bhatnagar of happy memory (1933–2019) in his “Many Splendoured Negation” (Bhatnagar in J Indian Counc Philos Res XXII(3):83–906, 2006) had shown many a facet that could be construed in “negation”. This paper is an attempt to revisit the notion of negation that R. S. Bhatnagar brought to light and to further the germane thought that he had outlined in his concise exposé. Though Bhatnagar had stated that there could be negative and positive functions of negations, a vigilant reading of his article shows that the primary import of Bhatnagar is to examine the positive function of negation. According to R. S. Bhatnagar, even death, which could be the negative in its most feared form, the reality of which, has the positive effect on the soul force in its commitment to live well and die well. R. S. Bhatnagar’s engagement with negation is not complete unless one takes into consideration “negation” as an integral part of philosophizing in India, whether it is the Buddhist tradition or any other tradition. One encounters the philosophical “exercise” on negation enormously in Buddhist thought. The first part of the paper is a brief discussion on the views of Bhatnagar in his essay mentioned with the author’s considerable add-on, while the second part brings home the Buddhist facet and paradigm of negation, the missing link in Bhatnagar. The third part of the paper is an unveilment of the cogitation of R. S. Bhatnagar on “death” in terms of negation.","Sebastian, C. D.",J,321,0

Covid-19 brought fears for the unknown and required an abrupt shift, creating anxiety for academic staff, students and parents. Amidst this transition, educators had to quickly reconfigure their designs, as specific pedagogical strategies set for in-class arrangements would no longer be appropriate for the new scenario. A whiplash redirect to the online mode introduced new tools and added uncertainties about Internet access and connectivity. People had to deal with remoteness and isolation and with changes to virtual learning. This paper theorizes about what it means to design for transition during an emergency. Drawing on the Activity-Centred Analysis and Design (ACAD) framework, we discuss implications for educational design, detailing how tools, social arrangements and tasks can be carefully orchestrated to support learning activity in emergency remote education. We situate the discussion within the transitioning experiences of students and staff at a Bachelor of Nursing programme, within a three-phased educational design which involved Virtual Happy Hours (VHH). The VHH sessions were run with two cohort groups of first- and second-year students in the Bachelor programme—and included their teaching staff. The intent of the VHH was to allow participants to familiarize themselves with tools, tasks and social elements that could be (re)used to facilitate engagement in a new online space—in preparation to the upcoming course sessions in the lockdown period.","Green, Jennifer K.; Burrow, Marla S.; Carvalho, Lucila",Postdigit Sci Educ,321,0

The parasite invades reticulocytes, employing the interaction between Plasmodium vivax Duffy binding protein (PvDBP) and human Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC). However, P. vivax has now been observed in Duffy-negative individuals, presenting a potentially serious public health problem as the majority of African populations are Duffy-negative. Invasion of Duffy-negative reticulocytes is suggested to be through duplication of the PvDBP and a novel protein encoded by P. vivax erythrocyte binding protein (EBP) genes. The emergence and spread of specific P. vivax strains with ability to invade Duffy-negative reticulocytes has, therefore, drawn substantial attention and further complicated the epidemiology and public health implication of vivax malaria. Given the right environment and vectorial capacity for transmission coupled with the parasite’s ability to invade Duffy-negative individuals, P. vivax could increase its epidemiological significance in Africa. In this review, authors present accruing knowledge on the paradigm shift in P. vivax invasion of Duffy-negative reticulocytes against the established mechanism of invading only Duffy-positive individuals and offer a perspective on the epidemiological diagnostic and public health implication in Africa.","Golassa, Lemu; Amenga-Etego, Lucas; Lo, Eugenia; Amambua-Ngwa, Alfred",Malar J,321,0

METHOD: This secondary data analysis examines the performance of benefits in the case of illness among benefit recipients according to the AsylbLG at the Research Data Centre of the Federal and State Statistical Offices. The examined group of individuals have not yet been granted refugee status or asylum entitlement. RESULTS: As of 31 December 2018, 423,201 persons in Germany were receiving benefits according to the AsylbLG. A good third of these were women. The average age was 24 years, and more than half came from Asia. More than one-third of all benefit recipients were in outpatient (33.5%) or inpatient treatment (1.3%). Among the federal states, benefits for assistance in the case of illness as well as the health-related per capita gross expenditure varied considerably. The provision of illness benefits in reception facilities was relatively low. With the health card, the use of inpatient treatment was higher. The standard health-related provision of assistance in special cases (§2 AsylbLG analogous to SGB XII) reached a higher share of people entitled to benefits at the end of the year (42.7%) than the minimum provision according to §3 AsylbLG (29.0%). Nevertheless, it caused comparatively less gross expenditure. CONCLUSION: It is recommended to apply §2 AsylbLG for a prestay period of three months or longer in order to be able to grant assistance analogous to Chapters 5 to 9 SGB XII earlier. Nationwide introduction of an electronic health insurance card for asylum seekers would improve access.","Hollederer, Alfons",Bundesgesundheitsblatt Gesundheitsforschung Gesundheitsschutz,321,0

Implementing evidence-informed actions is most challenging during a public health emergency as in an epidemic, when time is limited, scientific uncertainties and political pressures tend to be high, and irrefutable evidence may be lacking. The Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is determining a scenario of uncertainty for public health decision-making with fragmented and different responses also within countries (i.e. regional level), which are implemented quickly, sometimes not fully supported by the necessary body of scientific evidence. In such a situation, following a common line and having a shared tool that would allow to include evidence in public health decision-making, would be strategic to strengthen the impact of interventions, enabling stakeholders and decision makers taking actions based on the best available evidence through a process which is systematic and transparent.

Online surveys commonly suffer from two serious methodological limitations: the population to which they are distributed cannot be described, and respondents with biases may select themselves into the sample. Research is of value only when the findings from a sample can be generalized to a meaningful population. When the population addressed by the survey cannot be described, and when the sample is contaminated by respondents with biases, findings from online surveys cannot be generalized and may therefore mislead.","Andrade, Chittaranjan",Indian J Psychol Med,321,0

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective study among health plan members at Kaiser Permanente Southern California. We identified PLWH aged ≥ 18 years with a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic test or COVID-19 diagnosis and compared COVID-19 outcomes to HIV-negative cases. Chart review was conducted to examine HIV viral suppression, most recent CD4+ counts, and antiretroviral regimens in the year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis, as well as COVID-19 clinical presentation and outcomes. RESULTS: Between 3/1/20 and 5/31/20, 590 PLWH were tested for SARS-CoV-2, of which 47 (8.0%) were positive. An additional 14 patients had a clinical COVID-19 diagnosis, for a total of 61 cases identified among the population of 10,702 PLWH. Of these, 10 (16.4%) were hospitalized, 4 (6.6%) were admitted to ICU, 3 (6.4%) required invasive mechanical ventilation, and 1 (1.6%) died from COVID-19. In comparison, of the 12,921 HIV-negative individuals with COVID-19, 1975 (15.3%) were hospitalized, 494 (3.8%) were admitted to ICU, 444 (3.4%) required invasive mechanical ventilation, and 300 (2.3%) died from COVID-19. For 42 PLWH for whom chart review was complete (cases through 5/7/20), 52% were aged ≥ 50 years, and 98% were male. In the year prior to COVID-19 diagnosis, 98% were virally suppressed (HIV RNA < 40 copies/mL). Most recent mean CD4+ count was 600 cells/mm(3), and 4.8% had CD4+ ≤ 200 cells/mm(3). Median CD4 count was similar between hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients. Antiretroviral regimens included NRTIs (98% of patients), NNRTIs (31%), PIs (26%), INSTIs (57%), and CCR5 inhibitors (2.3%). The most common presenting symptoms were cough (76% of patients), fever (71%), and shortness of breath (48%). Table 1. SARS-CoV-2 testing, characteristics, and COVID-19 outcomes of HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected individuals at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, 3/1/20 to 5/31/20 [Image: see text] CONCLUSION: In this population of patients with well-controlled HIV, risks of severe COVID-19 outcomes were similar to HIV-negative individuals, although sample sizes of PLWH with COVID-19 were small. Analyses adjusted for demographics and comorbidities are needed to assess risk of severe COVID-19 among PLWH and to determine clinical predictors in this population.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the demands for contract tracing far exceeded the resources available to infection prevention and control (IPC) programs. Leveraging our Poison Control Center, our organization established a Contact Tracing Center (CTC) with content expertise and oversight by IPC and Occupational Health. The CTC identifies exposed patients and employees, provides testing guidance and scheduling, and offers post-exposure recommendations for employees. We describe patient outcomes due to employee exposures in a pediatric healthcare system. METHODS: Exposure data about employee to patient exposures (EPE) were captured real-time by scripted telephone interviews by our CTC. Chart review was performed to determine outcomes of exposed patients. A concerning exposure from a direct patient care provider to a patient was defined as unprotected contact at less than 6 feet for greater than 5 minutes in the 24 hours prior to developing symptoms. Data were analyzed to determine COVID-19 conversion rates for children exposed to pre-symptomatic and symptomatic employees based upon exposure risk stratification, window of exposure, and employees who worked with symptoms. RESULTS: From March 2020 – present, we identified 38 EPE that involved 10 employees; 26 EPE were pre-symptomatic and 12 EPE symptomatic exposures. The average number of EPE per employee was 3.8 (SD 3.01). There were no secondary transmission events to patients from either pre-symptomatic or symptomatic employees. After instituting universal masking, the number of concerning exposures to patients were 3 compared to 35 prior to universal masking. CONCLUSION: We describe the experience of a novel Contact Tracing Center, leveraging alternate staffing pools to track EPE resulting in no secondary transmission to patients either before or after universal masking. We credit sick policy adherence, high hand hygiene compliance, use of standard precautions, universal masking, robust contact tracing operations and a strong data collection system to identify process gaps.

We decided to conduct a case-controlled study to try to answer the question if PLWH are at higher risk of mortality compared to individuals without HIV infection but with the same risk factors that affects outcome in COVID-19 disease. METHODS: A retrospective case matched control study was performed from 03/15/2020 to 05/15/2020. We reviewed all confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients who were admitted to our hospital during the study period and retrieved 7 variables: Age, gender, diabetes mellitus (DM), hypertension (HTN), body mass index (BMI), chronic kidney disease (CKD), HIV status. We divided the age in 3 groups (< 30, 30 to 60, > 60), we defined the presence of DM and HTN by reviewing the admission medications, BMI > 30 defined obesity, and CKD was present if eGFR < 45 ml/min prior to the current admission. We found 12 PLWH, we matched them for the 6 variables, we found 94 controls. The primary endpoint was percentage of inpatient mortality. RESULTS: Of the 436 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection admitted between 03/15/20 and 05/15/20, 36 were still hospitalized. Twelve were PLWH out of the 400 patients with known outcome; 7 patients (58%) have the age range between 30 to 60 years old while the rest (42%) have age > 60 years old. Male to female ratio was 1:1 (6 patients each). Comorbidities were present in 10 patients (83%) with HTN (83%) being the most common, followed by CKD (58%), obesity (33%), and DM (33%). Only 1 patient expired out of the 12 PLWH (8%) admitted with COVID-19, as compared to 26 patients from the 98 matched cohort (27%) (z-score 1.38, p=0.17; odds ratio [OR], 3.972; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62–44.37). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that PLWH do not have a worse prognosis than their matched controls for the most significant comorbid conditions affecting outcome in COVID-19 disease. Further studies with a larger sample size are urgently needed to confirm this finding.

Tocilizumab is an IL-6 receptor blocker FDA-approved for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell-induced severe or life-threatening CRS. The objective of this study was to describe clinical outcomes associated with tocilizumab compared with those not receiving tocilizumab in critically ill patients with severe COVID-19. METHODS: Methods: Retrospective case series of 49 adult patients admitted to an intensive care unit with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Patients receiving tocilizumab were compared with those not receiving tocilizumab. The primary outcome was clinical improvement (decrease in supplemental oxygen requirement, discharge from ICU, or live discharge from hospital). Secondary endpoints included mortality and frequency of extubation. All comparative endpoints were assessed at 2 weeks after ICU admission. RESULTS: Results: 49 patients were identified with SARS-CoV-2 who were admitted to an ICU, 16 received tocilizumab. Baseline characteristics were similar; most were African American males with comorbidities such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. The time from symptom onset to positive test and subsequent intubation were similar (4 and 7 days, respectively). 75% received one dose (all received 8 mg/kg). The median time from symptom onset to tocilizumab administration was 11 days. In patients receiving tocilizumab compared with those not receiving tocilizumab, there were similar rates of clinical improvement (44% versus 61%, p=0.27), extubation (31% versus 45%, p=0.60), and mortality (18% versus 19%, p >0.99, respectively). 81% of the tocilizumab group had resolution of fever and 75% had improvement in C-reactive protein levels. CONCLUSION: Conclusion: In this study of patients with progressed disease, outcomes were similar regardless of receipt of tocilizumab. Randomized controlled trials are needed to assess the impact of earlier administration and identify clinical characteristics to assist with selection of appropriate patients who may benefit from tocilizumab.

The aim of this study was to investigate simultaneously the major blood-immune cell subsets in these patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Blood taken from 67 patients with decompensated cirrhosis (including 35 critically ill with ACLF in the intensive care unit), and 12 healthy subjects, was assigned to either measurements of clinical blood counts and microarray (genomewide) analysis of RNA expression in whole-blood; microarray (genomewide) analysis of RNA expression in blood neutrophils; or assessment of neutrophil antimicrobial functions. RESULTS: Several features were found in patients with ACLF and not in those without ACLF. Indeed, clinical blood count measurements showed that patients with ACLF were characterized by leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and lymphopenia. Using the CIBERSORT method to deconvolute the whole-blood RNA-expression data, revealed that the hallmark of ACLF was the association of neutrophilia with increased proportions of macrophages M0-like monocytes and decreased proportions of memory lymphocytes (of B-cell, CD4 T-cell lineages), CD8 T cells and natural killer cells. Microarray analysis of neutrophil RNA expression revealed that neutrophils from patients with ACLF had a unique phenotype including induction of glycolysis and granule genes, and downregulation of cell-migration and cell-cycle genes. Moreover, neutrophils from these patients had defective production of the antimicrobial superoxide anion. CONCLUSIONS: Genomic analysis revealed that, among patients with decompensated cirrhosis, those with ACLF were characterized by dysregulation of blood immune cells, including increases in neutrophils (that had a unique phenotype) and macrophages M0-like monocytes, and depletion of several lymphocyte subsets (including memory lymphocytes). All these lymphocyte alterations, along with defective neutrophil superoxide anion production, may contribute to immunosuppression in ACLF, suggesting targets for future therapies.","Weiss, Emmanuel; de la Grange, Pierre; Defaye, Mylène; Lozano, Juan José; Aguilar, Ferrán; Hegde, Pushpa; Jolly, Ariane; Moga, Lucile; Sukriti, Sukriti; Agarwal, Banwari; Gurm, Haqeeqat; Tanguy, Marion; Poisson, Johanne; Clària, Joan; Abback, Paer-Selim; Périanin, Axel; Mehta, Gautam; Jalan, Rajiv; Francoz, Claire; Rautou, Pierre-Emmanuel; Lotersztajn, Sophie; Arroyo, Vicente; Durand, François; Moreau, Richard",Front Immunol,321,0

Its homologous gene, CHI3L1, has been extensively studied in various tumors and has been shown to be related to immune infiltration in breast cancer and glioblastoma. High CHI3L2 expression was reported to be associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer and renal cell carcinoma. However, the prognostic significance of CHI3L2 in glioma and its correlation between immune infiltration remains unclear. In this study, we examined 288 glioma samples by immunohistochemistry to find that CHI3L2 is expressed in tumor cells and macrophages in glioma tissues and highly expressed in glioblastoma and IDH wild-type gliomas. Relationships between CHI3L2 expression and clinical features (grade, age, Ki67 index, P53, PHH3 (mitotic figures), ATRX, TERTp, MGMTp, IDH, and 1p/19q co-deleted status) were evaluated. Kaplan-Meier survival was conducted to show high CHI3L2 expression in tumor cells (TC) and macrophage cells (MC) indicated poor prognosis in diffusely infiltrating glioma (DIG), lower-grade glioma (LGG), and IDH wild-type gliomas (IDH-wt). The overall survival time was higher in patients with dual-low CHI3L2 expression in TC and MC compared to those in patients with non-dual CHI3L2 expression and dual high expression in DIG and IDH wild-type gliomas. By univariate and multivariate analysis, we found that high CHI3L2 expression in tumor cells was an independent unfavorable prognostic factor in glioma patients. Moreover, we used two datasets (TCGA and CGGA) to verify the results of our study and explore the potential functional role of CHI3L2 by GO and KEGG analyses in gliomas. TIMER platform analysis indicated CHI3L2 expression was closely related to diverse marker genes of tumor immune infiltrating cells, including monocytes, TAMs, M1 macrophages, M2 macrophages, TGFβ1+ Treg and T cell exhaustion in GBM and LGG. Western Blot validated CHI3L2 is expressed in glioma cells and microglia cells. The results of flow cytometry showed that CHI3L2 induces the apoptosis of CD8+ T cells. In conclusion, these results demonstrate CHI3L2 is related to poor prognosis and immune infiltrates in gliomas, suggesting it may serve as a promising prognostic biomarker and represent a new target for glioma patients.","Liu, Liling; Yang, Yuanzhong; Duan, Hao; He, Jiahua; Sun, Lu; Hu, Wanming; Zeng, Jing",Front Oncol,321,0

Our work focuses on TSS optimization and respective data offloading scheme. We propose a heuristics-based optimal TSS algorithm, a distinctive community identification algorithm, and an opportunistic data offloading algorithm. The proposed scheme has an overall polynomial time complexity of the order O(k(3)), where k is the number of nodes in the primary target set for convergence. However we have obtained its realization to linear order for practical reasons. To validate our results, we have used state-of-the-art datasets and compared it with literature-based approaches. Our analysis shows that the proposed Final Target Set Selection (FTSS) algorithm outperforms the greedy approach by 35% in terms of traffic over cellular towers. It reduces the traffic by 20% as compared to the heuristic approach.

Hospital facilities especially the ambulatory clinics began to adjust the ways to triage, assess and treat patients by using methods that do not rely on traditional face-face encounter. Here, we present one such scenario from the initial phase of pandemic in which team effort was involved in a diabetic emergency to overcome the barriers of emergent ambulatory care. Case Description: We present a 78-year-old female with past medical history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, multi-nodular goiter, hypertension, mild coronary artery disease, diastolic heart failure and dyslipidemia who called the clinic with an elevated point of care glucose of 436mg/dl. Other symptoms included high fever, polyuria and polydipsia having just been discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. She was on metformin 500 mg twice a day, glimepiride 2 mg daily, methimazole 5 mg daily, carvedilol 12.5 mg twice a day, losartan 100 mg daily, pravastatin 20 mg daily and furosemide 40 mg daily. Her most recent blood work showed an A1C of 8% (7.4 and 7.1 last year), TSH - 0.29 (0.4 -4.5 mIU/ml), FT4 - 1.1 (0.8–1.8 ng/ml), metabolic panel showed plasma glucose of 283 mg/dl along with normal electrolytes and kidney function. The patient was admitted to hospital about a week ago with flu like illness and high fever and was found to be COVID positive and was discharged home with instructions on isolation and follow up. However, while at home she noticed hyperglycemia 400–500 mg/dl despite oral agents, associated with polyuria and polydipsia but no nausea or vomiting. Given the significant symptomatic hyperglycemia along with symptomatic COVID infection it was clear that she acutely needed insulin therapy. As the patient was insulin naïve and COVID positive, there were several barriers in initiating insulin without hospitalization: we could not get her into the Endocrine office and she was declined ED evaluation because of her COVID positivity. She and the family were relatively computer novice so could not access our electronic health record video system. After discussion over the phone, our certified diabetes educator walked them through the process of downloading an app for video communication. Utilizing remote video communication, the patient’s 20-year-old grandson was educated on all the steps of Insulin use for the patient as she was still delirious. Gratifyingly, she responded well to initiation of insulin and subsequent glucoses were in the 100’s along with improvement in her symptoms. Conclusion: This case emphasizes how team effort and the zeal of health care community to serve patients can overcome shortcomings.","Mundada, Rachana; Marco, Cheryl; Miller, Jeffrey L",J Endocr Soc,321,16

However, the evidence about how the pandemic has affected clinical management of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, two common diseases worldwide, is lacking. We therefore aimed to examine the trends in the number of outpatients with thyroid disorders and their thyrotropin (TSH) levels before and during the pandemic in Japan. Methods: This cohort study included all patients aged ≥20 years who visited Ito Hospital, one of the largest hospitals that specialize in thyroid disorders in Japan, during 2019/1-2020/6. Our outcomes of interest were 1) trends in the aggregated number of visits at the clinic and 2) trends in average TSH levels from January 2019 to June 2020. The trends in TSH according to the clinic visit in early 2020 were assessed utilizing difference-in-difference models controlling for age, sex, and city of residence, stratified by each medication use (i.e., levothyroxine [LT4], antithyroid drug [ATD], potassium iodine [KI], or no medication). Results: During 2019/1-2020/6, we observed 517,412 visits at Ito Hospital for thyroid disorders, and the average number of visits per month was significantly decreased for both the first visits (1,995 in 2019 vs. 1,268 in 2020; reduction rate, 36%; p<0.001) and the follow-up visits (29,509 in 2019 vs. 21,959 in 2020; reduction rate, 26%; p<0.001). Among 15,455 patients who had been followed in 2019, we found a higher TSH at the follow-up visits during 2020/4-2020/6 among patients with LT4 who did not visit the clinic during 2020/1-2020/3 than those who did (difference-in-difference [95%CI]=+1.77 [1.25-2.29], p<0.001). We also found decreased trends in TSH among patients with ATD or KI who visited the clinic during 2020/1-2020/3 (p<0.001 for both categories), but not among patients with no medications (p=0.29). Conclusions: In this large cohort in Japan, we found the decreased number of outpatients with thyroid disorders since 2020/1 with a nadir in 2020/4. Using individual-level data, we also found the association between visiting the clinic in early 2020 and TSH control at the following visit among patients with medications. These findings highlight the importance of careful monitoring of patients with medications for thyroid disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Inoue, Kosuke; Noh, Jaeduk Yoshimura; Yoshihara, Ai; Watanabe, Natsuko; Watanabe, Masako; Fukushita, Miho; Suzuki, Nami; Hoshiyama, Ayako; Mitsumatsu, Takako; Suzuki, Ai; Kinoshita, Aya; Mikura, Kentaro; Yoshimura, Ran; Sugino, Kiminori; Ito, Koichi",J Endocr Soc,321,16

Positive-sense ssRNA viruses are about 30 kb long. Coronaviruses have a broad spectrum of action and affect multiple organisms. ORIGIN OF DISEASE: The disease outbreak has been initiated in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. The disease has been originated from the wet animal market of Wuhan City, where a large number of peoples have come in contact with animals. It is known to infect the neurological, respiratory, enteric, and hepatic systems. SARSCoV-2 is highly infectious, and its outbreak is worldwide (national and international level) and becomes pandemic. CONTROL: Presently, the number of cases continues to rise at a global level, and it is clear that these viruses pose a significant threat to public health. Consequently, extensive treatments, vaccines, and drugs have been developed by researchers to control the transmission of infection. This led to the isolation of patients that were administered a variety of treatments. Special attention and guidelines have been given by various government organizations to protect or reduce transmission between children, healthcare providers, and old-aged peoples.","Chittora, Deepali; Meena, Bhanu Raj; Mittholiya, Shivangi; Sharma, Kanika",Res,321,0

Micronutrients in blood serum, namely, zinc, iron, copper, and selenium, play essential roles in the human body’s various organs. This study investigates the association between micronutrient levels and the severity of symptoms in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients. METHODS: A cross-section study was conducted during June–August 2020 in Riyadh city among 80 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Within 24 hours of hospital admission, patients have been divided into non-severe and severe cases, and blood samples were drawn from each patient to measure the serum levels of copper, iron “in the form of ferritin,” selenium, and zinc. RESULTS: In both study groups, the mean copper and selenium serum levels were within the normal range, while the mean zinc and iron serum levels were elevated. A statistically significant difference was recorded between non-severe and severe cases regarding serum levels of iron and selenium (331.24 vs. 1174.95 ng/ml and 134 vs. 162 mcg/L, respectively, P < 0.0001). On the other hand, no significant difference was detected between both studied groups regarding serum level of zinc and copper (124.57 vs. 116.37 mcq/L and 18.35 vs. 18.2 mcmol/L, respectively, P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There was a significant elevation of selenium and iron serum levels among severe cases compared to non-severe cases of COVID-19. High levels of iron and selenium could be correlated with the disease severity during infection with SARS-CoV-2.","Alkattan, Abdullah; Alabdulkareem, Khaled; Kamel, Amr; Abdelseed, Heba; Almutairi, Yousef; Alsalameen, Eman",,321,0

This single-centre study has explored the resulted management differences. METHOD: Retrospective study covering Prepandemic-data over March-May,2019 & Pandemic-data over March-May,2020. RESULTS: Prepandemic-(43 patients): Mean age was 38.3 years. Mean length-of-stay was 1.7 days. Preoperative imaging was used in 32(74.4%) patients; this was diagnostic in 28(87.5%). Non-surgical management was used in 4(9.3%) patients; one needed surgery eventually. Surgical approaches in 40 patients were (laparoscopic: 38(95%), open: 2(5%)). Neither significant morbidity nor mortality was reported. Pandemic-(35 patients): Mean age was 31.2 years. Mean length-of-stay was 2.2 days. Preoperative imaging was used in 30(85.7%) patients; this was diagnostic in 26(86.6%). Non-surgical management was used in 8(22.9%) patients; one needed surgery eventually. Surgical approaches in 28 patients were (laparoscopic: 10(35.7%), open: 18(64.3%)). Neither significant morbidity nor mortality was reported, apart from one patient with COVID-19 postoperative infection. CONCLUSIONS: There was a tendency towards conservative approach/open surgery during the pandemic. Though this was statistically significant (p < 0.05), the total number of patients was small to achieve stronger conclusions. Laparoscopy was selectively used during the pandemic where the benefit outweighed the risks.","Buksh, M; Jabri, Y; Al Samaraee, A",Br J Surg,321,0

However, its physiological roles and substrates are largely unknown. Purification of CRL4-DCAF12 complexes revealed a wide range of potential substrates, including MOV10, an “ancient” RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) complex RNA helicase. We show that DCAF12 controls the MOV10 protein level via its C-terminal motif in a proteasome- and CRL-dependent manner. Next, we generated Dcaf12 knockout mice and demonstrated that the DCAF12-mediated degradation of MOV10 is conserved in mice and humans. Detailed analysis of Dcaf12-deficient mice revealed that their testes produce fewer mature sperms, phenotype accompanied by elevated MOV10 and imbalance in meiotic markers SCP3 and γ-H2AX. Additionally, the percentages of splenic CD4(+) T and natural killer T (NKT) cell populations were significantly altered. In vitro, activated Dcaf12-deficient T cells displayed inappropriately stabilized MOV10 and increased levels of activated caspases. In summary, we identified MOV10 as a novel substrate of CRL4-DCAF12 and demonstrated the biological relevance of the DCAF12-MOV10 pathway in spermatogenesis and T cell activation.","Lidak, Tomas; Baloghova, Nikol; Korinek, Vladimir; Sedlacek, Radislav; Balounova, Jana; Kasparek, Petr; Cermak, Lukas",Int J Mol Sci,321,0

Human to human interaction is the most prolific method of transmission of this virus. Nations all across the globe started to issue stay at home orders and mandating to wear masks or a form of face-covering in public to minimize the transmission by reducing contact between majority of the populace. The epidemiological models used in the literature have considerable drawbacks in the assumption of homogeneous mixing among the populace. Moreover, the effect of mitigation strategies such as mask mandate and stay at home orders cannot be efficiently accounted for in these models. In this work, we propose a novel data driven approach using LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) neural network model to form a functional mapping of daily new confirmed cases with mobility data which has been quantified from cell phone traffic information and mask mandate information. With this approach no pre-defined equations are used to predict the spread, no homogeneous mixing assumption is made, and the effect of mitigation strategies can be accounted for. The model learns the spread of the virus based on factual data from verified resources. A study of the number of cases for the state of New York (NY) and state of Florida (FL) in the USA are performed using the model. The model correctly predicts that with higher mobility the cases would increase and vice-versa. It further predicts the rate of new cases would see a decline if a mask mandate is administered. Both these predictions are in agreement with the opinions of leading medical and immunological experts. The model also predicts that with the mask mandate option even a higher mobility would reduce the daily cases than lower mobility without masks. We additionally generate results and provide RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) comparison with ARIMA based model of other published work for Italy, Turkey, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, Japan, and the UK. Our model reports lower RMSE than the ARIMA based work for all eight countries which were tested. The proposed model would provide administrations with a quantifiable basis of how mobility, mask mandates are related to new confirmed cases; so far no epidemiological models provide that information. It gives fast and relatively accurate prediction of the number of cases and would enable the administrations to make informed decisions and make plans for mitigation strategies and changes in hospital resources.","Banerjee, Sandipan; Lian, Yongsheng",Appl Intell,321,12

Compared to conventional internal combustion engines, electric vehicles can generate a wider variety of longitudinal behaviors based on their high-performance motors and regenerative braking systems. The longitudinal behavior of a vehicle affects the driver’s driving satisfaction. Notably, each driver has their own driving style and as such demands a different performance for the vehicle. Therefore, personalization studies have been conducted in attempts to reduce the individual driving heterogeneity and thus improve driving satisfaction. In this respect, this paper first investigates a quantitative characterization of individual driving styles and then proposes a personalization algorithm of accelerating behavior of electric vehicles. The quantitative characterization determines the statistical expected value of the personal accelerating features. The accelerating features include physical values that can express acceleration behaviors and display different tendencies depending on the driving style. The quantified features are applied to calculate the correction factors for the target torque of the traction motor controller of electric vehicles. This driver-specific correction provides satisfactory propulsion performance for each driver. The proposed algorithm was validated through simulations. The results show that the proposed motor torque adjustment can reproduce different acceleration behaviors for an identical accelerator pedal input.","Kim, Haksu",Sensors (Basel),321,0

Farming returns were not negatively impacted by COVID‐19 and it appears as though farming returns will be strong into 2021.

The future consequences of COVID‐19 on farmland values are unclear. Some economists suggest that future inflationary risks have increased. A return to inflation rates comparable to those experienced in the 1970s is unlikely, but if increased inflation does materialize it will put upward pressure on farmland values, while increases in nominal and real interest rates will push farmland values down.","Lawley, Chad",,321,0

The manifold psychological and physical stressors in the world of work can, in sum, lead to disorders of the organism and to illness. Since the physical and subjective consequences of stress vary individually, no absolute threshold values can be determined. Machine learning (ML) methods are used in this article to research the systematic recognition of patterns of physiological and subjective stress parameters and to predict stress. The logistics sector serves as a practical application case in which stress factors are often rooted in the activity and work organisation. One design element of the prevention of stress is the work break. ML methods are used to investigate the extent to which stress can be predicted on the basis of physiological and subjective parameters in order to recommend breaks individually. The article presents the interim status of a software solution for dynamic break management for logistics. Practical Relevance: The aim of the software solution “Dynamic Break” is to preventively prevent stress resulting from mental and physical stress factors in logistics and to keep employees healthy, satisfied, fit for work and productive in the long term. Individualized rest breaks as a design element can support companies in deploying human resources more flexibly in line with the dynamic requirements of logistics.","Foot, Hermann; Mättig, Benedikt; Fiolka, Michael; Grylewicz, Tim; ten Hompel, Michael; Kretschmer, Veronika",Z Arbeitswiss,321,0

We model the market demand and investment cost as the geometric Brownian motions with jumps driven by the Poisson processes. A new computing method independent on specific distribution functions is proposed for the real option models with jump processes of random frequency and amplitude. Based on this method, we find that both firms delay investment with a larger capacity as uncertainties of demand and investment cost increase. We also demonstrate that two firms both invest later and the optimal capacity relationship between them is ambiguous in the presence of two sources of uncertainty. Numerical simulation reveals that upward (downward) jump in demand and downward (upward) jump in investment cost cause the firms to invest earlier (later) with a larger (smaller) capacity. Finally, in a duopoly with symmetric firms, the first investor invests earlier than in an asymmetric duopoly due to the threat of preemption.","Wu, Xiaoqin; Hu, Zhijun",Math Finan Econ,321,0

Luciferase assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) were carried out to explore the underlying target involved in the roles of ZIC2 in NSCLC. Here, we reported that ZIC2 was upregulated in NSCLC tissues, and high expression of ZIC2 predicted worse overall and progression-free survival of NSCLC patients. Silencing ZIC2 repressed tumorigenesis and reduced the anoikis resistance of NSCLC cells. Mechanical investigation further revealed that silencing ZIC2 transcriptionally inhibited Src expression and inactivated steroid receptor coactivator/focal adhesion kinase signaling, which further attenuated the anoikis resistance of NSCLC cells. Importantly, our results showed that the number of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) was positively correlated with ZIC2 expression in NSCLC patients. Collectively, our findings unravel a novel mechanism implicating ZIC2 in NSCLC, which will facilitate the development of anti-tumor strategies in NSCLC.","Liu, Aibin; Xie, Huayan; Li, Ronggang; Ren, Liangliang; Yang, Baishuang; Dai, Longxia; Lu, Wenjie; Liu, Baoyi; Ren, Dong; Zhang, Xin; Chen, Qiong; Huang, Yanming; Shi, Ke",Mol Ther Oncolytics,321,0

India, one of the world’s top consumer of antibiotics and second most populated country has its unique constraints of social, cultural and economic strata. The continual self-medication, use of antibiotics for the growth promotion in animals, and accumulation of residual antibiotics in the environment challenge the implementation of AMR containment policy. Hence, the present review attempts to delineate the influence of antibiotics abuse on the human, animal and environmental health under the realm of one health. It was based on the literature search using public databases to highlight the rapid surge in the burden of AMR in India affecting various sectors and/or ecosystems in India. It was found that the irrational and overuse of antibiotics in different sectors have led to the emergence of extended antimicrobial resistance wherein the environment acts as a reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs); completing the cycle of contamination and recontamination. There are efforts by government policy makers to reduce the burden of AMR in the country to reduce the health risks, through the One Health approach. Parallel efforts in educating healthcare professionals, strict legislation for pharmacies and pharmaceutical companies should be prioritize. At the same time surveillance of newly emerged AMR pathogens, prioritising research focusing on AMR, and awareness camps or programs among the local population is critical while addressing the consequences of spared of AMR in India.","Jani, Kunal; Srivastava, Vibhaw; Sharma, Preeti; Vir, Aruna; Sharma, Avinash",J Epidemiol Glob Health,321,0

Herein, we describe these associations with mortality in a largely minority underserved population. METHODS This single center retrospective observational study included all adult subjects with laboratory confirmed SARS-Cov-2 treated in our ICU between March 15th and May 10th, 2020. RESULTS 128 critically-ill adult subjects were included in the study (median age 68 Interquartile range(IQR) 61-76), 45% female, and 64% African-American); 124 (97%) required intubation. Eighty (63%) died during their inpatient stay, which did not differ by race/ethnicity. Compared with other racial/ethnic groups, African-Americans had a greater proportion of women (52% vs. 30%, p=0.02), and hypertensives (91% vs. 78%, p=0.035). Asthma (p=0.026) was associated with lower inpatient death, primarily among African-Americans (p=0.02). Among African-Americans, increased age (OR [95% CI]: 1.06[1.05-1.22]per year], positive fluid balance (1.06 [1.01-1.11]per 100 mL), and treatment with Tocilizumab (25.0 [3.5-180]) were independently associated with inpatient death, while higher platelets (0.65 [0.47-0.89]per 50 x 103/ml) and treatment with intermediate dose anticoagulants (0.08 [0.02, 0.43]) were protective. Among other race/ethnic groups, higher total bilirubin (1.75 [0.94, 3.25]per 0.2 mg/dL) and higher maximal lactate (1.43 [0.96, 2.13]per mmol/L) were marginally associated with increased death, while Tocilizumab treatment was marginally protective (0.24 [0.05, 1.25]). During first 72 hours of ventilation, those who died had less increase in PaO2/FiO2 (p=0.046), and less reduction in positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) (p=0.01), and FiO2 requirement (p=0.002); these patterns did not differ by race/ethnicity. CONCLUSIONS African-American and other race/ethnicity subjects had similar mortality rates from Covid-19, but differed in factors that were associated with increased risk of death. In both groups, subjects who died were older, had a positive fluid balance and less improvement of PaO2/FiO2 ratio, PEEP, and FiO2 requirement on ventilation.","Chaudhary, Siddique; Benzaquen, Sadia; Woo, Jessica G; Rubinstein, Jack; Matta, Atul; Albano, Jeri; De Joy, Robert; Lo, Kevin Bryan; Patarroyo-Aponte, Gabriel",Respiratory care,321,1

IB virus primarily affects respiratory tract, but strains differ in their tropism for such other target organs as kidneys and alimentary tract. The objective of this study was to estimate the pathogenicity of an Iranian IB virus (IBV) variant (variant-2) which is one of the most prevalent isolates circulating in Iranian poultry farms. SPF chickens were intranasally inoculated with 104 EID50/0.1 ml of the virus. Sera, fecal swabs, and different tissue samples were collected on different days post infection. Clinical signs, gross pathology, and histological changes were recorded. The amount of virus genome was quantified in different tissues and feces using quantitative real-time PCR assay. The highest viral loads were detected in the feces and cecal tonsils. Real-time PCR results demonstrated variant-2 tropism for respiratory tract, digestive system and renal tissue that is due to its epitheliotropic nature. This is the first pathogenicity study of Iranian variant-2 virus. Based on histology observations and clinical signs this isolate was classified as a nephropathogenic IBV. Further knowledge of IBV pathogenesis permits to perform more effective prevention practice.","Najafi, H; Ghalyanchi Langeroudi, A; Hashemzadeh, M; Madadgar, O; Karimi, V; Farahani, R K; Abdollahi, H; Maghsoudsloo, H; Seifouri, P",Acta virologica,321,17

Currently the beginning of the de-escalation phases that will led us to a new normal, forces us to establish some degree of priority in the interventions as well as in the medical consultations. Our objective is to establish some recommendation on Functional Urology office visits and surgical interventions that serve as a tool to facilitate decision-making. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Experts in Functional Urology from different autonomous communities of Spain were contacted to design a strategy to reorganize the activity of both, diagnosis and treatment. A modified nominal group technique has been used due to the extraordinary restrictions of assembly and mobility during the COVID pandemic. The first signer (EMC) made the first draft with the measures adopted and the strategy to be followed during the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposal was sent to the rest of the authors, in order to unify criteria and experiences to reach a quick consensus on the relative priority of the different activities, problems and solutions. A final version was approved by all authors May 27, 2020. RESULTS: Tables of recommendation have been prepared for outpatient consultation, surgical and technical interventions, according to de-escalation phases proposed by the Spanish Associations of Surgeons. CONCLUSIONS: The change that COVID-19 Pandemich as involved in our clinical practice force us to seek alternative methods to treat our patients, some of which may already be established. Mean while, a consensusin decision making is necessary. Documents such as the current one, are intended to guide the management of patients with urological functional pathology in exceptional situations.

However, the feasibility of pre-procedural stent size estimation using QISS MRA would merit investigation. PURPOSE: To evaluate the feasibility of QISS MRA for pre-procedural stent size estimation in PAD patients compared to computed tomography angiography (CTA). STUDY TYPE: Retrospective. SUBJECTS: Thirty-three PAD patients (68 ± 9 years, 18 men, 15 women). FIELD STRENGTH/SEQUENCE: Two-dimensional balanced steady-state free precession QISS MRA at 1.5 T and 3 T. ASSESSMENT: All patients received QISS MRA and CTA of the lower extremity run-off followed by interventional digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Stenotic lesion length and diameter were quantified (AMF and AVS with 3 and 13 years of experience in cardiovascular imaging, respectively) to estimate the dimensions of the stent necessary to restore blood flow in the treated arteries. Measured dimensions were adjusted to the closest stent size available. STATISTICAL TESTS: The Friedman test with subsequent pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the estimated stent dimensions between QISS MRA, CTA, and the physical stent size used for intervention. Intra-class correlation (ICC) analysis was performed to assess inter-reader agreement. Significant differences were considered at P < 0.05. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed between estimated stent diameter by QISS MRA or CTA compared to physical stent diameter (8.9 ± 2.9 mm, 8.8 ± 3.0 mm, and 8.8 ± 3.8 mm, respectively; &#967;2 = 1.45, P = 0.483). There was a significant underestimation of stent length for both QISS MRA and CTA, compared to physical stent length (45.8 ± 27.8 mm, 46.4 ± 29.3 mm, and 50.4 ± 34.0 mm, respectively; &#967;2 = 11.96) which could be corrected when measurements were adjusted to the next available stent length (&#967;2 = 2.38, P = 0.303). Inter-reader assessment showed good to excellent agreement between the readers (all ICC &#8805;0.81). DATA CONCLUSION: QISS MRA represents a reliable method for pre-procedural lesion assessment and stent diameter and length estimation in PAD patients.

Due to the severe pneumonia infiltration, the patient received the clinical-trial treatment Remdesivir. In addition to facing the isolation and new-drug-related anxieties of the patient, the medical team faced difficulties in communicating effectively with the patient and in helping him through the isolation period. During the period of hospitalization (March 14th to April 13th, 2020), the author used Roy's adaptation model to perform a nursing assessment, which confirmed that the patient faced the following problems: (1) ineffective breathing pattern related to COVID-19, (2) impaired verbal communication related to hearing impairment, and (3) social isolation related to the isolation experience and the communication barrier with healthcare workers. During the nursing care process, the author helped the patient receive the antiviral treatment and taught him how to do diaphragmatic breathing in a comfortable, recumbent position to improve his breathing pattern. To reduce the difficulty of communication, the author made a pile of cards with common care-related words, provided pen and paper to write, and used a mobile-phone-based social-networking application to communicate with the patient. The author used writing to communicate with the patient and learned some simple signs from him to enable interaction. Moreover, the intervention helped him adapt to the isolation and treatment protocols to reach holistic nursing care. Based on this experience, the author suggests that hospitals cooperate with sign language organizations to teach healthcare workers simple communication skills, including sign language and cards to provide more complete care for patients with hearing loss during hospitalization.","Chen, Cheng-Hsuan; Pan, Mei-Yan; Liu, Hsiu-Yun",Hu Li Za Zhi,321,29

Serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) is frequently found elevated in severe SARS-CoV2 infection, which indicates skeletal muscle damage precipitating limb weakness or even ventilatory failure. CASE PRESENTATION: We addressed such a patient in his forties presented with features of severe SARS-CoV2 pneumonia and high serum CPK. He developed severe sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and received intravenous high dose corticosteroid and tocilizumab to counter SARS-CoV2 associated cytokine surge. After 10 days of mechanical ventilation (MV), weaning was unsuccessful albeit apparently clear lung fields, having additionally severe and symmetric limb muscle weakness. Ancillary investigations in addition with serum CPK, including electromyogram, muscle biopsy, and muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) suggested acute myopathy possibly due to skeletal myositis. CONCLUSION: We wish to stress that myopathogenic medication in SARS-CoV2 pneumonia should be used with caution. Additionally, serum CPK could be a potential marker to predict respiratory failure in SARS-CoV2 pneumonia as skeletal myopathy affecting chest muscles may contribute ventilatory failure on top of oxygenation failure due to SARS-CoV2 pneumonia.","Islam, Badrul; Ahmed, Mohiuddin; Islam, Zhahirul; Begum, S.

Recently, Enterovirus A71 (EVA71) infection was found to hijack the VCP protein. However, the mechanism by which VCP participates in the EVA71 life cycle remains unclear. Using chemical inhibitor, RNA interference and dominant negative mutant, we confirmed that the VCP and its ATPase activity were critical for EVA71 infection. To identify the factors downstream of VCP in enterovirus infection, 31 known VCP-cofactors were screened in the siRNA knockdown experiments. The results showed that UFD1 (ubiquitin recognition factor in ER associated degradation 1), but not NPL4 (NPL4 homolog, ubiquitin recognition factor), played critical roles in infections by EVA71. UFD1 knockdown suppressed the activity of EVA71 pseudovirus (causing single round infection) while it did not affect the viral replication in replicon RNA transfection assays. In addition, knockdown of VCP and UFD1 reduced viral infections by multiple human Enterovirus A serotypes. Mechanistically, we found that knockdown of UFD1 significantly decreased the binding and the subsequent entry of EVA71 to host cells through modulating the levels of nucleolin protein, a coreceptor of EVA71. Together, these data reveal novel roles of VCP and its cofactor UFD1 in the virus entry by EVA71.","Yan, Jingjing; Wang, Meng; Wang, Min; Dun, Ying; Zhu, Liuyao; Yi, Zhigang; Zhang, Shuye",Virus Res,321,33

Therefore, this research is designed under two different studies: (A) Study 1: Effects of COVID-19 pandemic on students' psychological symptoms and (B) Study 2: Views and expectations of students and school counselors about school counseling services. The first study was a quantitative study and included 549 high school students (398 female, 151 male). A structural equation model (SEM) was created to examine the effects of COVID-19 pandemic on participants' psychological symptoms. The Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) scores showed that 107 (19.50%) individuals had a score of 50 and above pointing out that individuals in this group had severe impact of event/trauma symptomologies. The SEM analysis indicated that IES-R scores had a total effect of 0.79 on anxiety, 0.75 on depression, 0.74 on negative self-concept, 0.68 on somatization, and 0.66 on hostility scores. Furthermore, female students had significantly higher scores on anxiety, depression, negative self-concept, somatization, hostility, and impact of events variables than male students. Study 2 was a qualitative design and consisted of five school counselors and five students from different schools. The results indicated that students' difficulties during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak were educational, cognitive, emotional, physiological, relational, technological, and related to routines. Academic, social, emotional, and behavioral issues came to the fore among the difficulties that can be experienced if students start face-to-face education. On the other hand, the school counselors listed that family relations, personal–social, emotional, and academic themes were the difficulties experienced by the students at the beginning of the COVID-19. In addition, when COVID-19 started, the services offered by school counselors were discussed under (1) services for the student, (2) services for the family, and (3) services for the teacher. Finally, according to the opinions of the school counselors, if students start face-to-face education, they may experience emotional, academic, and relational difficulties.

Several approaches had thus been developed to provide clear insights of a model prediction for a particular observation but at the cost of long computation time or restrictive hypothesis that does not fully take into account interaction between attributes. This paper provides methods based on the detection of relevant groups of attributes -named coalitions- influencing a prediction and compares them with the literature. Our results show that these coalitional methods are more efficient than existing ones such as SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP). Computation time is shortened while preserving an acceptable accuracy of individual prediction explanations. Therefore, this enables wider practical use of explanation methods to increase trust between developed ML models, end-users, and whoever impacted by any decision where these models played a role.","Ferrettini, Gabriel; Escriva, Elodie; Aligon, Julien; Excoffier, Jean-Baptiste; Soulé-Dupuy, Chantal",Inf Syst Front,321,1
